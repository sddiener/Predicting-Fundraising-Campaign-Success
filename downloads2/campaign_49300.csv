<h3>Greetings!</h3>
<p>I’m Jeremiah Clarke, an actor, writer and producer. Like many of us, quarantining during COVID gave me extra time to learn how to bake, gain weight but also on a serious note, time to reflect on my life and experiences. <i>Walk By Faith </i>started out as a diary. A way I was finally able to say what I’ve held in for so long. While getting these thoughts on paper, it became therapeutic and it made me realize how many others have, are currently experiencing or sadly will experience,..Domestic Violence. <i>Walk By Faith’s </i>theme is Traumas, Triggers and Triumph. I want this film to not only entertain viewers, but also bring <strong>AWARENESS</strong> and <strong>EDUCATION</strong> and <strong>MAKE A DIFFERENCE</strong> in many people’s lives. Domestic Violence comes in so many forms and no one is exempt. <i>Walk By Faith</i> will show the almost untold story of a male survivor and the story of a woman survivor.  JeKai Entertainment has completed a proof-of-concept trailer. So, without further ado check out this amazing trailer and interview with me.  </p>
<h3>Walk By Faith – Synopsis </h3>
<p>In today's world, many of us seek out a certain “type” of relationship to fill a void. In this relationship, you strive to what society calls a “fairy tale ending” but instead you realize the void that is so missing in your life is something that only you can fill spiritually and emotionally. Through the traumas, triggers and triumph, <i>Walk By Faith</i> shows when a man or woman truly commit to the journey far beyond sight, professional guidance, along with a strong support system, is a necessity to be used as a compass to navigate the uncharted pathways to a sustained life of happiness. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our objective is to raise close to 50 thousand dollars to meet the budget of making the movie,  pre and post production costs.  </p>
<p>By DONATING, you will help us reach the goal of AWARENESS, EDUCATION, PREVENTION and MAKING A DIFFERENCE. I will be donating a percentage of all money that is raised to the National Center on Domestic Violence, Trauma and Mental Health (<i>NCDVTMH</i>). With your assistance, together we can make a difference. In addition to helping this project a reality, we have lots of PERKS to honor YOU!  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>While <i>Walk By Faith</i> touches on many aspects of life and realities within relationships, the most important is the effects of loneliness and abuse.  We want to spread the realities of domestic violence not only against women but all people, including men.  In addition, how black and other minority communities are not prone to go to therapy though sometimes, it is needed to overcome certain struggles in their lives to become the person they are destined to be.  All in all, you have to have faith!   </p>
</div><div>
<h3>We Need You!</h3>
<p>Independent film making takes team work and every contribution, share and mention go a long way.  We are dedicated to our craft and this project.  We will get  it done and if you contribute  you will know that you had a hand in bringing it to life. </p>

<p>So, what is this film about? ""Mortician"" is a horror genre film like no other, mixed with comedy elements and dramatic sequences which will have some massive special effects (blood, make-up, and gore)!  Synopsis: The funeral home business is never short of clients. For mortician Edgar Crow, Crow's Funeral Home is no different! Edgar is a proud 4th generation funeral director, but after 163 years in business, he is faced with legal troubles that shut down his funeral home forever! But to Edgar, forever is not an option, which leads him with a plan. Edgar along with his assistant Cyrus, will now adventure down a very dark path that will leave a trail of blood everywhere they go, all for the love of the dead!</p>
<h3><strong>The Cast/Crew</strong></h3>
<p>This film will be directed together for the first time by Davy Lantz Jr and Cori Coulter!

We hope you enjoy, now a little bit about our film:</p><p><u><strong>HOW:</strong></u></p><p>We want to assure you that every penny raised for this project goes directly to the areas that would make this project a stand-out success. We are currently knee deep into filming and looking for funds needed to bring us across the finish line! Any money received would be allocated towards:</p><p>-Sound / Soundtrack/ Sound production. Priority number 1 is the music. With this being a movie based around music, we need to ensure that we're able to record a studio quality soundtrack and in addition have it adequately mixed. Additionally we want to make sure the film has pristine sound quality. If there's anything that will immediately take you ""out"" of a quality looking film, its poor sound quality.</p><p>- A quality film crew; including a professional Director of Photography and Sound Director. </p><p>- HQ Film Equipment Rentals. In addition to this film sounding amazing, we need to make sure that this film looks just as good.</p><p>-Locations; because we intend to have live performances - we will need to be able to book performance space.</p><p><u><strong>WHAT:</strong></u></p><p>So what is TURN UP THE NIGHT? It is a movie that's takes place circa 1987-1989 and it falls the rise and ultimate fall of the (fictional) hard rock/ ""hair band"", Boy Elroy. There is a phrase called the ""golden prison"" - where essentially you've gotten everything in the world you could have ever imagined, but then you are ultimately shackled by it. In our story, Derek Carver - the lead guitarist, is struggling to find his place in the world. Having an almost virtuoso type guitar playing ability, he travels to Los Angeles to try making it on his own. While in Los Angeles he joins the band, Boy Elroy, and forms a contentious relationship with lead singer Kimmi Gaines; they could be the best of friends or worst of enemies. Kimmi , who is extremely talented in his own right, feels insecure and second fiddle to Derek; not being able to find his own place in the world his jealousy drives him down a path of self-destruction. The crux of the story focuses on their relationship - Derek seemingly on the incline, Kimmi on the decline - and that middle ground is where they are legendary. Additionally, there are themes about identity - and having to lose yourself as an individual as a result of fame; then ultimately becoming a ""product"". This film will include riveting music, dramatic performances, and a story that's so unique compared to what else is out there. </p><p><u><strong>WHO:</strong></u></p><p>My name is Rick Masi, from Buffalo, NY - I am the writer and director of the film TURN UP THE NIGHT. I have been making films for just about the last 5 years, to which I very humbly and thankfully say - I have found a lot of success since I've entered this crazy world called filmmaking. My philosophy to this point has been to get the best quality film with what limited resources I have - and I have ran with that philosophy to the point where I can now call myself a multi-award winning national (and international) writer/ director.

Thank you!</p></div>","NOTE: This is a film based around 80's hair band music - and it would be a enormous leap of faith to ask for your assistance without hearing any of the music - THANKFULLY, we have music from the film in the  teaser and on our Facebook page! We hope you enjoy, now a little bit about our film:HOW:We want to assure you that every penny raised for this project goes directly to the areas that would make this project a stand-out success. We are currently knee deep into filming and looking for funds needed to bring us across the finish line! Any money received would be allocated towards:-Sound / Soundtrack/ Sound production. Priority number 1 is the music. With this being a movie based around music, we need to ensure that we're able to record a studio quality soundtrack and in addition have it adequately mixed. Additionally we want to make sure the film has pristine sound quality. If there's anything that will immediately take you ""out"" of a quality looking film, its poor sound quality.- A quality film crew; including a professional Director of Photography and Sound Director. - HQ Film Equipment Rentals. In addition to this film sounding amazing, we need to make sure that this film looks just as good.-Locations; because we intend to have live performances - we will need to be able to book performance space.WHAT:So what is TURN UP THE NIGHT? It is a movie that's takes place circa 1987-1989 and it falls the rise and ultimate fall of the (fictional) hard rock/ ""hair band"", Boy Elroy. There is a phrase called the ""golden prison"" - where essentially you've gotten everything in the world you could have ever imagined, but then you are ultimately shackled by it. In our story, Derek Carver - the lead guitarist, is struggling to find his place in the world. Having an almost virtuoso type guitar playing ability, he travels to Los Angeles to try making it on his own. While in Los Angeles he joins the band, Boy Elroy, and forms a contentious relationship with lead singer Kimmi Gaines; they could be the best of friends or worst of enemies. Kimmi , who is extremely talented in his own right, feels insecure and second fiddle to Derek; not being able to find his own place in the world his jealousy drives him down a path of self-destruction. The crux of the story focuses on their relationship - Derek seemingly on the incline, Kimmi on the decline - and that middle ground is where they are legendary. Additionally, there are themes about identity - and having to lose yourself as an individual as a result of fame; then ultimately becoming a ""product"". This film will include riveting music, dramatic performances, and a story that's so unique compared to what else is out there. WHO:My name is Rick Masi, from Buffalo, NY - I am the writer and director of the film TURN UP THE NIGHT. I have been making films for just about the last 5 years, to which I very humbly and thankfully say - I have found a lot of success since I've entered this crazy world called filmmaking. My philosophy to this point has been to get the best quality film with what limited resources I have - and I have ran with that philosophy to the point where I can now call myself a multi-award winning national (and international) writer/ director. This would be the first time I am ever attempting any kind of fundraising for a project - my ambitions were to prove myself with limited or no-budget. My ongoing webseries, TALES OF DARKENED LIGHT has gotten the most acclaim, and I write and develop this project for no-budget.

<h3><u>A DEER IN THE WOODS </u></h3>
<p><i>A Deer in the Woods</i> is a feature-length horror/thriller/dark comedy which follows a group of amateur film students who set out to make a horror film in a secluded cabin in the woods. Harper, an aspiring actress, has signed on to Director Cyrus Wakefield's horror project as an understudy. However, when Abby, the lead actress, mysteriously disappears, Harper is given the opportunity of a lifetime to star in her first movie. But, when Harper arrives to the secluded cabin, she begins to notice that Wakefield and members of his crew are hiding something sinister. As Harper tries to survive the night, she slowly starts to uncover the truth: that she may be trapped in a horror film herself.</p>
<p>The cast and crew of <i>A Deer in the Woods</i> are also creating an accompanying short film to go along with the feature entitled, ""The Droste Effect"" which follows Abby, the original actress from Cyrus Wakefield's horror film and the backstory around her mysterious disappearance.</p>
<p>Both <i>A Deer in the Woods</i> and ""The Droste Effect"" are not yet rated. However, they are assumed to be similar to an ""R"" rating for language, violence and blood. </p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>WHAT WE NEED</u></h3>
<p>In order to successfully produce our full-length student film, we created a budget of $10,000. The breakdown of where the funding will go can be found below: </p>

<p><u><strong>SCREENING FEES</strong></u> – To bring <i>A Deer In The Woods</i> to life and give viewers an unforgettable experience, we will need funding for festival submissions and theater screening costs.</p>
<p><u><strong>COSTUME</strong></u> – This film includes a wardrobe consisting of modern fashion as well as costuming that involves supernatural story-piece purchases.</p>
<p><strong><u>EQUIPMENT</u></strong> – In order to bring the film to life and achieve the desired look, we must purchase specific cameras, lighting equipment, sound devices, etc. Due to limited access between semesters, we do not have full access to our university's equipment rental, so we need to purchase many of these items.</p>
<p><strong><u>PROPS</u></strong> – To create the horror-based world in which <i>A Deer In The Woods</i> takes place, props are a must! Props range anywhere from fake weaponry, items for set design and even fake blood ingredients. The overall costs may vary, but allotting a good chunk of our budget to props will ensure the safety of our cast and crew, and a high production value for our film. </p>
<p><u><strong>POST-PRODUCTION</strong></u> – This section will cover areas such as an original soundtrack, purchase of foley recordings, costs associated with music composition and overall editing expenses.</p>
<p><strong><u>CATERING</u></strong> – Given the nature of the film, our shoots usually run late into the night. In order to keep our cast and crew productive, we plan to ensure everyone is well-fed and hydrated on set. </p>
<p><u><strong>TRAVEL</strong></u> – Due to the remote location of the film, travel costs are significant for our cast and crew. We usually film after dark as well, which creates more shooting days than a typical production. </p>

<p>Bad Maggie, 9, takes her Mom, CINDY up on her idea that neither of them go to school or work on this Friday morning. She spends the morning at Cedar Park, skateboarding and crossing-off bad deeds on her BAD DEEDS TO DO LIST.  When she gets bored with this, she goes into her mom's salon, TALKING HEADZ, and is greeted by the the hairstylists, and by RICKY, the salon manager, who has brought her repaired skates for the record release party being held at the salon that night. She tries them on and takes some loops around the salon.  When her Mom comes in carrying some ice behind more folks carrying booze, Bad Maggie hopes to show her her new skates and help her decorate the salon for the party, but her mom is busy setting up the bar, and slips away. Bad Maggie ends up prepping for the party with some of the hairstylists, as more and more punks file into the salon after hours.</p>
<p>Bad Maggie has a group of friends lined up against the red-lip shaped couch, in order of tallest to smallest. Bad Maggie is up on the tallest kids back, piggy back. They play a game of telephone that Bad Maggie starts, with a whisper that makes its way down the line to the youngest and smallest kid in her posse. They nod to Maggie in understanding. Bad Maggie secretly gets the DJ to let her hook up her karaoke machine into the sound system. Cindy flirts with a guy, and calls the salon her baby. Maggie and her friends are covertly collecting cigarettes, cell phones and lighters into a clear vinyl backpackBag Maggie's best friend EMMA holds. Ricky and Cindy smoke and speak outside about Cindy having a rough time.  Cindy learns that Ricky has been keeping an eye on Bad Maggie when she's at the park. A loud noise of feedback is coming through the speakers. Cindy goes rushing into the salon to catch Bad Maggie singing lyrics over a punk rock song about everyone needing to leave, telling them the party is over. By the time Cindy can get to Bad Maggie, she's holding up the backpack full of cell phones and cigarettes, and threatens to fill the backpack with water if they don't leave, and giving a nod to her best friend, who sprays water all over the large room with the nozzle from the shampoo sink, soaking the partiers and making the floor slick. Chaos and falling and confusion prevails. Cindy grabs Bad Maggie down off the table and hauls-off with her into the back, to her office, where she can get to the bottom of what's going on. </p>
<p>They have an explosive one-on-one, that reveals Bad Maggie's real reason for her bad behavior. <strong>As they embrace, time stands still.</strong><i> The camera hovers over Bad Maggie's face as her head leans back, taking in a long slow breath. Bad Maggie's exhale of this breath pushes the camera up toward the ceiling, and comes back down to hover over Cindy's face, who is just finishing a long intake of breath. </i>They make eye contact again, and begin to dry off.

<p>I love my neighborhood! I've lived in West Philly now for 20+ years. Shooting this film in West Philly gives me the honor of celebrating people who live and work here, and who strive to create the community that makes West Philly special. Contributions will go to restaurants in West Philly for catering, Park Services, Grocery stores, and a handful of artists who are graphic designers, print makers, jewelry makers, and clothing designers, boutique owners, whose products and will be featured throughout the film. I'm honored to be able to celebrate these iconic people with gigantic hearts, like Heather Deforrest, the Master Stylist and Colorist, founder and owner of Talking Headz. Heather opened her salon ten years ago this year, and has dedicated her time and energy into making her salon one that is an inclusive, safe space for all people. She intentionally keeps prices extremely low so that everyone can have the style that best suits them. The salon serves as a center for community via the many fundraisers Heather organizes every year, like the one I attended yesterday to support LGBTQIA Afghan refugees find their way to a safer country, and safer life. Their mission statement is, RAD HAIR FOR RAD PEOPLE. Please visit their website, check them out! <u><a href=""https://talkingheadzsalon.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://talkingheadzsalon.com</a></u>  I'll be adding more and more people like who make this neighborhood great in the updates section, so please check back! </p>

I can only spare 20 days from our launch date for this fundraising campaign,  instead of the usual 30-60 days campaigns.  It's so important that you consider contributing as soon as you can so that we will meet our goal by December when we head into production!!!
                
BAD MAGGIE is a story two women, a daughter and mother, written by a woman, produced by three women, shot in an all female punk rock salon, Talking Headz Salon, and it will be shot by my mostly female production and post production crew. Please support these brilliantly talented females who have busted their butts to get where they are to bring this story to you! 
                               

Bad Maggie, 9, takes her Mom, CINDY up on her idea that neither of them go to school or work on this Friday morning. She spends the morning at Cedar Park, skateboarding and crossing-off bad deeds on her BAD DEEDS TO DO LIST.  When she gets bored with this, she goes into her mom's salon, TALKING HEADZ, and is greeted by the the hairstylists, and by RICKY, the salon manager, who has brought her repaired skates for the record release party being held at the salon that night. She tries them on and takes some loops around the salon.  When her Mom comes in carrying some ice behind more folks carrying booze, Bad Maggie hopes to show her her new skates and help her decorate the salon for the party, but her mom is busy setting up the bar, and slips away. Bad Maggie ends up prepping for the party with some of the hairstylists, as more and more punks file into the salon after hours.
Bad Maggie has a group of friends lined up against the red-lip shaped couch, in order of tallest to smallest. Bad Maggie is up on the tallest kids back, piggy back. They play a game of telephone that Bad Maggie starts, with a whisper that makes its way down the line to the youngest and smallest kid in her posse. They nod to Maggie in understanding. Bad Maggie secretly gets the DJ to let her hook up her karaoke machine into the sound system. Cindy flirts with a guy, and calls the salon her baby. Maggie and her friends are covertly collecting cigarettes, cell phones and lighters into a clear vinyl backpackBag Maggie's best friend EMMA holds. Ricky and Cindy smoke and speak outside about Cindy having a rough time.  Cindy learns that Ricky has been keeping an eye on Bad Maggie when she's at the park. A loud noise of feedback is coming through the speakers. Cindy goes rushing into the salon to catch Bad Maggie singing lyrics over a punk rock song about everyone needing to leave, telling them the party is over. By the time Cindy can get to Bad Maggie, she's holding up the backpack full of cell phones and cigarettes, and threatens to fill the backpack with water if they don't leave, and giving a nod to her best friend, who sprays water all over the large room with the nozzle from the shampoo sink, soaking the partiers and making the floor slick. Chaos and falling and confusion prevails. Cindy grabs Bad Maggie down off the table and hauls-off with her into the back, to her office, where she can get to the bottom of what's going on. 
They have an explosive one-on-one, that reveals Bad Maggie's real reason for her bad behavior. As they embrace, time stands still. The camera hovers over Bad Maggie's face as her head leans back, taking in a long slow breath. Bad Maggie's exhale of this breath pushes the camera up toward the ceiling, and comes back down to hover over Cindy's face, who is just finishing a long intake of breath. They make eye contact again, and begin to dry off. Cindy has a suggestion for how to end the night, just the two of them. The party rages on, and the two sneak out the back entrance of the salon. The camera follows them down the back alley. The music from the party getting more and more faint.  They become two silhouettes in the moonlight.

Hutton Gibson was vilified by the press as a “racist,” “bigot,” “anti-Semite,” and “Holocaust denier.” He was condemned by so-called journalists who had never met or interviewed him.</p><p>And Mel himself was attacked for not “denouncing” his father.</p><p>The media hysteria and vitriol led many people to ask the question: who is Hutton Gibson?

David Cole was invited to bring a camera crew to Tomball, Texas (where Hutton lived at the time) to spend a weekend and document Hutton's life and views. What resulted was a lengthy shoot that covered everything Hutton wanted to discuss, everything he wanted to preserve on the record for posterity: his faith, his personal history, his family, and his views on religion (not just Catholicism, but Judaism, Islam, and secularism), marriage, children, politics, the Holocaust, and the most pressing issues of the day.</p><p><strong>It was at the time, and remains to this day, the only in-depth, sit-down, on-camera interview that Hutton ever allowed.</strong></p><p>Hutton spoke as a scholar, a spiritual leader, and a family man.

<p>His Name Was Jason is a short film based off of Jason Voorhees from the Friday the 13th Franchise. It takes place between parts 1 and 2 of the movie franchise. Jason is now in his late 20's early 30's but has been presumed dead due to the drowning incident, or is he? Camp Crystal Lake has been shut down and abandoned for years on the account of the horror that unfolded on the night of Friday the 13th, 1979. The town folk of Crystal Lake are finally putting it past them and cautiously moving on but never forgetting. Only whispers and stories are told to the children at times when they misbehave and are instructed to never go in to the woods of “Camp Blood, or Jason is gonna get ya!”. ""Camp Blood"" is the nick name given by the locals.</p>
<p>This film will show you the story of 3 lifelong high school friends: Bo Thompson, Charles (Chuck) Roberts and Mickey (Mick) Bowetz. All 3 friends are avid deer hunters that made an ill-fated decision to venture into the foreboding area of Camp Crystal. Their belief of tracking and hunting a prized Buck that has eluded most hunters of the community for many years, will bring the town's name back on the map. This Buck seems to have found refuge and solitude in the foreboding area of the lake on the account that man hasn't tread there for so long. Once these lifelong friends enter the woods, they feel that time has almost come to a complete stop and direction seems to be off kilter. In the far-off distance, they get a glimpse of their prize and the thrill for the hunt begins! As quickly as it begins, they are also quick to realize the hunters have now become the hunted. The truth behind those scary ghost stories and of the legend that lurks at Camp Crystal Lake, is very much alive and has been living well without being disturbed by outsiders until that fateful November day.</p>
<p>I will also tell the story of Jason and his life of solitude, living in the wooded areas and abandoned camp ground of Camp Crystal Lake, as he forages and scavenges in order to survive. He is also constantly tormented by his mother’s voice and her words in his head to ""guard and protect the camp ground"", including the surrounding lake because this is now his domain. It’s all he’s ever known and is closest to a home he'll ever have.</p>
<p>We will bear witness to how Jason protects his home through this short film.</p>
<p>On the subject of the rights to Friday the 13th, we would again, like to formally acknowledge that we are in no way affiliated with Paramount Pictures, New Line Cinema, entity, person or individual associated with the Original Friday the 13th Franchise. If anyone from those entities takes issue with what we are trying to accomplish, we will happily comply with whatever is asked of us by those parties.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Little about me... I decided to take on this feat 2 years ago because my family and friends all gave me the encouragement  to pursue this seemingly impossible dream. I have been writing this back story for a few years now and I’m stoked at this becoming a reality. This short film is really for the fans of the Friday the 13th Franchise and those who have been trying to piece together what happened to Jason between the first 2 movies. A bit about myself…….I grew up in the '80s, being a huge fan of ALL HORROR MOVIES!!! Needless to say, Friday the 13th was, is and continues to be my all-time favorite. There was always something about that boy jumping out of the lake that terrified me! And the Sack Mask Jason in Part 2. Growing up in South New Jersey, where Friday the 13th was filmed, made it feel like it was in my own backyard and that is where my love for the films came from!! AND…….most of the filming for my short film will be located in close proximity to the original film location of Part 1 .  Now in my late 40's, having a career in the creative field for 20 plus years, dabbling with prop making and creating screen accurate costumes for fun, I want to bring it all to life in this small fan film. I can’t afford to do this alone and will need all the support and funding I can get. I know I can bring this story to reality but only with your help. I know there are a lot of Friday the 13th fans out there and we can do this TOGETHER!! This film will be mine as much as it will be yours. After all, it is you, the fans, who will ultimately decide whether this project will become a reality. To those of you who do decide to back this project, I will forever be grateful and humbled by your generosity for this opportunity. I promise you this will be a film that will be as close to the originals as they come. Thank You in advance for your support and to those who have been following my Facebook Fan Page since July 2018!</p>
<p>Thanks Again for your support!</p>
<p>Dave Brown creator of HNWJ.</p>
<p>PS ~ Remember……Jason is not dead. We just have to wake him up!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Risks and challenges</p>
<p>Indiegogo- This portion of the budget will go towards Indiegogo fees and the purchase of rewards for backers.</p>
<p>Volunteers: This project would not be where it is today without a dedicated team of volunteers who have donated their time at no cost to the project. Made up of friends, family, and colleagues, this group also includes the core.</p>
<p>Actors: Gotta throw them something! Food and Travel.</p>
<p>Risks and challenges <br/>As you know it takes more than the $20K we are asking to make a film of this quality. Costumes, wardrobe, props, flights, hotels, craft services/ food and equipment rentals are very costly. This campaign will help to fund the film. We may run a second campaign in the future based on needs if any amount over our goal does not cover production and or post production expenses.</p>

This film will show you the story of 3 lifelong high school friends: Bo Thompson, Charles (Chuck) Roberts and Mickey (Mick) Bowetz. All 3 friends are avid deer hunters that made an ill-fated decision to venture into the foreboding area of Camp Crystal. Their belief of tracking and hunting a prized Buck that has eluded most hunters of the community for many years, will bring the town's name back on the map. This Buck seems to have found refuge and solitude in the foreboding area of the lake on the account that man hasn't tread there for so long. Once these lifelong friends enter the woods, they feel that time has almost come to a complete stop and direction seems to be off kilter. In the far-off distance, they get a glimpse of their prize and the thrill for the hunt begins! As quickly as it begins, they are also quick to realize the hunters have now become the hunted. The truth behind those scary ghost stories and of the legend that lurks at Camp Crystal Lake, is very much alive and has been living well without being disturbed by outsiders until that fateful November day.
I will also tell the story of Jason and his life of solitude, living in the wooded areas and abandoned camp ground of Camp Crystal Lake, as he forages and scavenges in order to survive. He is also constantly tormented by his mother’s voice and her words in his head to ""guard and protect the camp ground"", including the surrounding lake because this is now his domain. It’s all he’s ever known and is closest to a home he'll ever have.
We will bear witness to how Jason protects his home through this short film.
On the subject of the rights to Friday the 13th, we would again, like to formally acknowledge that we are in no way affiliated with Paramount Pictures, New Line Cinema, entity, person or individual associated with the Original Friday the 13th Franchise. If anyone from those entities takes issue with what we are trying to accomplish, we will happily comply with whatever is asked of us by those parties.
 
Little about me... I decided to take on this feat 2 years ago because my family and friends all gave me the encouragement  to pursue this seemingly impossible dream. I have been writing this back story for a few years now and I’m stoked at this becoming a reality. This short film is really for the fans of the Friday the 13th Franchise and those who have been trying to piece together what happened to Jason between the first 2 movies. A bit about myself…….I grew up in the '80s, being a huge fan of ALL HORROR MOVIES!!! Needless to say, Friday the 13th was, is and continues to be my all-time favorite. There was always something about that boy jumping out of the lake that terrified me! And the Sack Mask Jason in Part 2. Growing up in South New Jersey, where Friday the 13th was filmed, made it feel like it was in my own backyard and that is where my love for the films came from!! AND…….most of the filming for my short film will be located in close proximity to the original film location of Part 1 .  Now in my late 40's, having a career in the creative field for 20 plus years, dabbling with prop making and creating screen accurate costumes for fun, I want to bring it all to life in this small fan film. I can’t afford to do this alone and will need all the support and funding I can get. I know I can bring this story to reality but only with your help. I know there are a lot of Friday the 13th fans out there and we can do this TOGETHER!! This film will be mine as much as it will be yours. After all, it is you, the fans, who will ultimately decide whether this project will become a reality. To those of you who do decide to back this project, I will forever be grateful and humbled by your generosity for this opportunity. I promise you this will be a film that will be as close to the originals as they come. Thank You in advance for your support and to those who have been following my Facebook Fan Page since July 2018!
Thanks Again for your support!
Dave Brown creator of HNWJ.
PS ~ Remember……Jason is not dead. We just have to wake him up!
 
Risks and challenges
Indiegogo- This portion of the budget will go towards Indiegogo fees and the purchase of rewards for backers.
Volunteers: This project would not be where it is today without a dedicated team of volunteers who have donated their time at no cost to the project. Made up of friends, family, and colleagues, this group also includes the core.
Actors: Gotta throw them something! Food and Travel.
Risks and challenges As you know it takes more than the $20K we are asking to make a film of this quality. Costumes, wardrobe, props, flights, hotels, craft services/ food and equipment rentals are very costly. This campaign will help to fund the film. We may run a second campaign in the future based on needs if any amount over our goal does not cover production and or post production expenses.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>About the Project</h3>
<p>An instrument invented in 1928 continues to captivate the hearts of musicians across the world. When Maurice Martenot, creator of the Ondes Martenot, came to Japan in February 1931 he introduced a haunting and expressive electronic instrument that would one day affect the destiny of an impassioned Japanese craftsman (Naoyuki Omo). This documentary will not only follow one American's journey toward acquiring this unique and rare instrument in Japan but also that of hundreds of devoted Ondists around the globe.</p>
<h3>About the Filmmaker</h3>
<p>My name is Ata Alford, I am a 24-year-old American musician with an immense passion for the Ondes Martenot, an instrument that I never thought I'd have the opportunity to play. I hope to recognize and honor the history of the Ondes and its community with this film.  My goal is to put as much love and care into this documentary as I can, with the hope that it will adequately reflect the beauty of the Ondes Martenot. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>There is no budget for this film. It is a small project with the soundtrack, editing, filming, and marketing done solely by myself. Unfortunately, I cannot fully fund this project on my own. With your help, the cost of my flight to Japan along with my hotel room will not be such a burden and will allow me more time to work on this film. </p>
<ul>
<li>I am asking for $2,000.</li>
<li>This will cover my flight to Japan as well as a hotel room for a couple of weeks.</li>
<li>If the goal is exceeded, the money will go into purchasing better equipment, filming more locations, translations, and physical releases of the film and original soundtrack. (If you choose the $75 perk or above you will receive the physical release regardless.)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Legacy of Love</h3>
<ul>
<li>The film will showcase interviews with Ondists around the world as well as Ondomo inventor Naoyuki Omo</li>
<li>An overview of the Ondes Martenot design and features </li>
<li>Featurette of influential musicians Takashi Harada and Jonny Greenwood</li>
<li>A personal journey of music and life. </li>
</ul>
<p>Over the past few months, since I reserved my Ondomo from Mr. Naoyuki in Japan, I have been learning Japanese, preparing equipment, intensely researching, and selling many of my belongings in order to fund this passion project. It is an exciting adventure. By helping finance this film you will give me the freedom to fully express the wonderful history that Japan shares with the Ondes Martenot, as well as showcase the fascinating man Naoyuki Omo, and his creation, Ondomo.</p>
<p><strong>Will this documentary be free to watch online?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I plan on making this documentary available on YouTube and other platforms for free!</p>
<p><strong>What other films have you made?</strong></p>
<p>If you would like to view my other work, please check out my YouTube channel. I am primarily a musician, and this will be my first full-length film. I have, however, filmed and edited several music videos and art projects which you will see on my channel: <strong><a href=""https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy3ofylGqKhjmTHeE_gu6stF64CkNWXKM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy3ofylGqKhjmTHeE_gu6stF64CkNWXKM</a></strong></p>

<p>This story was inspired by the myth of the ‘false hydra,’ monster. The concept of a homebrew monster that creates a paranoia inducing experience by stealing its victims memories has driven the director to create Lotus Cycle.

<p>Horror is far more than just frightening stories. We’ve all experienced painful experiences in life, and <i>Lotus Cycle</i> aims to shed a light on this in a truly chilling and thought provoking way. At its core <i>Lotus Cycle</i> is a confronting story about the manifestation and resurfacing of trauma. On an emotional level the audience will be able to connect to the protagonist and the emotional truth present in it’s storytelling, specifically with the emotional abuse that Lotus experiences. </p>
<p>Overall Lotus Cycle works not just on our fears of the dark and the unknown, but also on our fears about the worst in all of us and the demons we must face in life in a fascinating yet frightening way.</p>

<p>The crew of Lotus Cycle are prepared to solve any challenges that may arise during the shoot. The production and post production process is where the majority of challenges will arise.

</div></div>","Lotus Cycle is an intense psychological horror story following the main protagonist named Lotus. Lotus lives in a small country town by herself. Her night is suddenly interrupted when she encounters a strange...yet familiar man on her doorstep. Ignoring the concerns of her intuition, she reluctantly invites him inside. Lotus is quickly swept up into a terrifying and intense night as the man she invited inside her home manifests. The monster preys upon Lotus as it torments her, distorts her reality and eventually reveals his true form. Lotus is forced to confront the menacing monster that threatens to steal all her memories before it is too late.

<div>Bushwick Bill is a gangsta' rapper who became famous in the group <b>The Geto Boys </b>(originally spelled<b> Ghetto Boys</b>).  He may be short in stature, but he is a giant in what he has been able to accomplish and overcome.  A pioneer of gangsta and horror core rap, Bill has spewed some of rap's most controversial, violent, and offensive lyrics.   He has gone toe to toe with the US government fighting against music censorship; he has been demonized by the media and the politicians. Unwavering and tough as nails. Bushwick Bill always tells it like it is, and he usually has the last word. </div>

<div>For the past 3 years, we have been filming and documenting the life of the infamous Richard Shaw, AKA <b>Bushwick Bill</b>, original member of the <b>Geto Boys</b> and all around fascinating presence and one of the most unique entertainers ever.  Our desire to do a documentary on Bill has been one that stretches over a decade long.  It finally became a reality a few years ago when we were able to track Bill down in Austin, Texas.  A bit of a rolling stone, Bill may jump from town to town, but one thing is certain, no matter where he lands, people <i><b>always </b></i>recognize him. He is undoubtably a hardcore rap legend. He has the stories to back it up.  He has rapped lyrics that command it.   And he literally has the scars to prove it.   <br/>

<h3>Brief Summary</h3> <p>The film shows a now more mature Bill reflecting on his highly controversial life as one of the original <b>Geto Boys,</b> the South’s first rap group to gain national exposure.  Bill recounts his most memorable triumphs and failures, both public and private. </p>
<p>Famous but not rich, Bill has struggled with both notoriety and the blurred lines between a person and his persona. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Despite a life full of challenges, let downs and bad decisions, the diminutive Bill has managed to overcome the obstacles, sometimes with a wink and a smile.  </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Bill is living proof that truth is undoubtably stranger than fiction</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">.  His story is outrageous, compelling, and often borders on the surreal, and it needs to be heard and shared.  </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Which leads us to YOU.</b></p>

He stands about 4'2"", is a gangsta rapper, lost his eye to gun violence and doesn't compromise for anyone.

Richard Shaw.  
Bushwick Bill.  
Bushwick Mother F**kin' Bill. 

Any motherf*cker wanna get with Bushwick ?

Bring it on cause your size ain't sh*t!


Bushwick Bill is a gangsta' rapper who became famous in the group The Geto Boys (originally spelled Ghetto Boys).  He may be short in stature, but he is a giant in what he has been able to accomplish and overcome.  A pioneer of gangsta and horror core rap, Bill has spewed some of rap's most controversial, violent, and offensive lyrics.   He has gone toe to toe with the US government fighting against music censorship; he has been demonized by the media and the politicians. Unwavering and tough as nails. Bushwick Bill always tells it like it is, and he usually has the last word. 


2013 BUSHWICK BILL - GETO BOY TEASER




For the past 3 years, we have been filming and documenting the life of the infamous Richard Shaw, AKA Bushwick Bill, original member of the Geto Boys and all around fascinating presence and one of the most unique entertainers ever.  Our desire to do a documentary on Bill has been one that stretches over a decade long.  It finally became a reality a few years ago when we were able to track Bill down in Austin, Texas.  A bit of a rolling stone, Bill may jump from town to town, but one thing is certain, no matter where he lands, people always recognize him. He is undoubtably a hardcore rap legend. He has the stories to back it up.  He has rapped lyrics that command it.   And he literally has the scars to prove it.

Brief Summary The film shows a now more mature Bill reflecting on his highly controversial life as one of the original Geto Boys, the South’s first rap group to gain national exposure.  Bill recounts his most memorable triumphs and failures, both public and private. 
Famous but not rich, Bill has struggled with both notoriety and the blurred lines between a person and his persona. 
Despite a life full of challenges, let downs and bad decisions, the diminutive Bill has managed to overcome the obstacles, sometimes with a wink and a smile.  Bill is living proof that truth is undoubtably stranger than fiction.  His story is outrageous, compelling, and often borders on the surreal, and it needs to be heard and shared.  Which leads us to YOU.
What We Need & What You GetWe are just about through production and headed into post production. We have a few more interviews to finish and we are now about to cross the bridge into licensing of archival footage/materials and music (all very pricey).  We also need  to build our post production team who will help us shape this phenomenal story. We've used up a lot of our favors and thankfully we have some generous and  talented friends and colleagues who were able to help us get this far!  The $50,000 we are trying to raise will barely scratch the surface of our overall costs, so we hope to be able to raise above and beyond this amount.  
We have self-financed everything up until now and have been working on this film in between our ""day jobs"" but we know with the appropriate support from the Indiegogo and indie film community, not only will we be able to finish it faster, we will be able to make the film the best it can be. We don't want to do a watered down film.   To do it right, and to get it done this year, we need your help. Know that any amount given will go towards finishing the film and will help get Bill's remarkable story out there.  We have some pretty sweet perks available (see them to the right). We teamed up with a talent designer and have hats, t-shirts and stickers available as a way of saying thank you. We even one perk for the super fan/super supporter called the PLEDGE OF A LUNATIC. This is one for the bucket list!
STICKERS, HATS AND T-SHIRTS AVAILABLE FOR OUR SUPPORTERS
T-Shirts! Please specify shirt size. Sizes range S-XXL. Please add $2 extra for size XXL.

Who are we?

In the late 80s/early 90s, when the director of the film, Greg Roman, was working at Eide's Records and Comics in his hometown of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, his way of protesting censorship was to buy every single record that came out with the Explicit Lyrics Advisory logo on it.  Greg was immersed in underground culture, which at the time gangasta rap fell into.   Already a huge fan of hip hop, Greg knew he stumbled upon something monumental when he first got his hands on the Geto Boys, self-titled Def American Release.  They spoke the truth. They answered to no one, and it was the most hardcore sh*t to hit the street.  Ever.  


Greg has always been drawn to underdogs, outsider characters and great stories. Bushwick Bill's life story encompasses all of the above.   Greg currently is a filmmaker who shoots and directs documentary shorts/branded content as his day job.  Bushwick Bill Geto Boy is Greg's absolute dream project.   It is not every day that you have the opportunity to help someone realize a dream!  






The Impact


 Bushwick Bill is most often known for his size (he is a little person), his hardcore lyrics, and the tragic incident where he lost his right eye (which led to the infamous We Can't Be Stopped Album cover.)  The album cover went down in rap, if not music, history.  


Bill's persona is such a strong one, and so many people really think he is only that persona. We've spent so much time with Bill that the lines have started to blur for us as well. He is not just the notorious ""one-eyed dwarf gangsta rapper."" The more time we spend with him we see an artist who has overcome so many obstacles;  we see a musician, still hustling; we see a father trying to provide for his family; we see a charming person with a killer sense of humor. 
    Risks & Challenges Shooting AND completing a film requires the dedication and passion of so many people.  Any independent filmmaker will tell you that filmmaking is hard but incredibly fulfilling.  We hope to have a full rough cut by the end of the year.  We are committed to this project and will finish it regardless, but with some help, we can share Bill's inspirational and remarkable story sooner.  Bill told us last year that he was really eager to get the film out as soon as possible.   He confided that some people who have the same affliction as him start to experience health problems when they reach a certain age - all the more reason to support this project and get this film out soon.

<h3>The Movie</h3>
<p>In this thriller, Rebecca (Skyler Wexler) befriends a strange, lonely girl named Nadia (Cynthia Galant), who has a dark secret: a twin sister named Aidan who is malicious and not quite what she seems. An old man, McKenna, (Andrew Gillies, also known from “Orphan Black”) dutifully watches them and their controlling mother, Eve, (Carmen Gillespie) from across the street in an attempt to keep everyone safe, but things have already gone too far, and Rebecca may be in grave danger. </p>

<p>Some eagle-eyed fans of Orphan Black may recognize it from one episode. It's perfect for our shoot. Secluded with a rustic, creepy atmosphere. </p>

<h3>Can we do the 'twinning' effect?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Some of you may wonder, ""Wait, just because some of the cast was in <i>Orphan Black</i> (where Tatiana Maslany played 12 clones) that doesn't mean they can successfully have one actress (Cynthia) in a dual role, by themselves!"" </p>
<p>Fortunately, we learned a lot from being on the set of <i>Orphan Black</i>. Not only as the three cast members, but Alexander filled in as Script Supervisor on a few days on two episodes. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522865471/cgcaryaowtlooncnfhow.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Alexander used his <i>Orphan Black</i> experience on set for the Canadian Film Centre short<i> Perfect </i>(Official TIFF selection) where one actress played twins. As script supervisor, Alex checked eyelines, interaction, and coordinated (constantly) with the people doing the visual effects and editing/post-production as filming went along. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522865564/xouq1t1qrhtpyr6tae8s.png"" src=""""/></p>

In this thriller, Rebecca (Skyler Wexler) befriends a strange, lonely girl named Nadia (Cynthia Galant), who has a dark secret: a twin sister named Aidan who is malicious and not quite what she seems. An old man, McKenna, (Andrew Gillies, also known from “Orphan Black”) dutifully watches them and their controlling mother, Eve, (Carmen Gillespie) from across the street in an attempt to keep everyone safe, but things have already gone too far, and Rebecca may be in grave danger.

How Your Support Will Be Used:
Every donated dollar will go towards the production of this film, its completion and getting it out into the world.  No donation is too small.  Even a five-dollar donation can go toward what we need to spend on equipment, location fees or post-production fees like visual FX, editing & sound mixing, and music scoring.



 
Location
This is the main location we want to use for Shadowed:

Some eagle-eyed fans of Orphan Black may recognize it from one episode. It's perfect for our shoot. Secluded with a rustic, creepy atmosphere. 
The rental rate for this location is: $5,000 per day. 
 
Can we do the 'twinning' effect?

Some of you may wonder, ""Wait, just because some of the cast was in Orphan Black (where Tatiana Maslany played 12 clones) that doesn't mean they can successfully have one actress (Cynthia) in a dual role, by themselves!"" 
Fortunately, we learned a lot from being on the set of Orphan Black. Not only as the three cast members, but Alexander filled in as Script Supervisor on a few days on two episodes. 

Alexander used his Orphan Black experience on set for the Canadian Film Centre short Perfect (Official TIFF selection) where one actress played twins. As script supervisor, Alex checked eyelines, interaction, and coordinated (constantly) with the people doing the visual effects and editing/post-production as filming went along. 

For Shadowed, we will employ an acting double as was done in Orphan Black and as seen in the above still of the monitor from Perfect.  In our shot, Sarah Hemphill will act opposite Cynthia Galant for the scenes where the twins interact. Our challenge is in their knock down fight! 
Cynthia and Alexander also have experience with working on greenscreen to create the cloning effect. First, in this reinactment of the infamous four-clone dance (from season 2 of Orphan Black). 


 
And then again, in this parody that was made as a thank you to the fans/cast & crew. This Orphan Black/Les Miz parody contains homage to all 12 clones.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>Hidden beneath the World Heritage mountains of Tasmania, giant prehistoric spiders the size of dinner plates seek kinky love in the dark... Neil Gaiman brings a real-world “Charlotte’s Web” into our world of rapid change. Through award-winning cinematography,<strong> SIXTEEN LEGS</strong> looks at the challenge, humour and science of capturing something never-before-filmed, against all the odds!</i></p>
<p>We are a group of biologists and educators working with some of the most unusual animals and in some of the most remote places on the planet. We've also provided opportunities for students working on positive environmental projects from Fiji to Antarctica. Over seven years, we produced <i><strong>SIXTEEN LEGS</strong></i>, a documentary about the life-cycle of giant prehistoric spiders still living in Australia's deepest caves. This project has received international acclaim and awards, and this has allowed us to educate and entertain people around the globe with the difficulties of underground life. Having produced versions of the film for cinema, television and exhibitions, we now wish to produce a Special Edition Blu-Ray and DVD set of this film that includes the full theatrical and main broadcast versions (including a special shorter version designed for younger audiences), as well as behind the scenes making of material. We also want to use the wealth of unused natural history footage, interviews with global experts, and additional popular culture material to produce a fun and fascinating online multimedia resource on caves, spiders, and the underground realm for schools and the public. We're inviting you to be a part of the next stages of this exciting project. Our resources are always stretched between our environmental and educational work, and your contributions will play a major role in taking <i><strong>SIXTEEN LEGS</strong> </i>into the next big steps of its multi-legged journey.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The film and its broadcast variants are already complete, so no additional funding is required for production. However, we need to raise a minimum of $20,000 to make the Special Edition release viable. Of this amount, about 50% will go to factory mastering and pressing of the double disc Blu-Ray and DVD sets, including PAL and NTSC options for supporters (see FAQ). About 15% will go to formal rating and classification of the variants of the documentary and the extra features, and licensing. Editing will take another 15%, and about 7.5% each will go to third-party licensing and design. The final 5% is the platform fee for Indiegogo. These amounts will let us reach the minimum Special Edition production costs, as well as baseline editing for the online multimedia resource. Any funds over and above $20,000 will provide more detailed editing work on the online resources, which will get bigger and better with the more support we receive.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1604044336/ocykga5pzefsd0mcmvio.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In return for helping this great educational cause, you get your own copy of the film - whether as the standard 98 minute theatrical version for online streaming, or the Special Edition Collection on your choice of DVD or Blu-Ray. The DVD will be a two-disc set featuring the full 98 minute theatrical version of the film, plus a special 1x 50 minute broadcast version of the film edited to better suit younger audiences. The Blu-Ray will upgrade the first disc of the set to the full HD Blu-Ray format, and will also include a special alternate 2x 50 minute broadcast version of the feature film. (This will be made available to DVD supporters as an online extra). Both the DVD and Blu-Ray sets will include the award-winning behind the scenes film '<i><strong>16 Legs: Spider Love</strong></i>' as well as additional featurettes on overcoming arachnophobia, the story of the <i><strong>SIXTEEN LEGS </strong></i>concept, the music of <i><strong>SIXTEEN LEGS</strong></i>, and trailers. There will also be a viewing guide to assist educators in showing the film to students.</p>
<p>As a <strong>special incentive to order early</strong>, we are offering a discount early-bird price until 10 November for the first 200 DVD sets, the first 200 Blu-Ray sets, and the first 200 sets of either that are coupled with online community option. These early-bird options also include the opportunity to get a name-checked 'thank you' on the discs, and we will also aim to get the first batch of discs sent out for Christmas (Covid-19 delivery times allowing). The earlier you order, the better your chances of that happening!</p>

<p>As well as the film, there are also additional rewards and benefits available, including packages of 2x hardback books showcasing the artwork and photography of the film. <i>‘SIXTEEN LEGS: A Visit to the Queen of the Dark’ </i>is a 44 page hardback showcasing expanded versions of Jodee Taylah’s superb production art from the film and the <i>SIXTEEN LEGS: Enter the Cave Exhibition</i>, alongside the story components that were then under development with Neil Gaiman, Niall Doran and Craig Wellington. The book also contains the scientific background to the story, a glimpse behind the research and personal reflections on the involvement of the participants above. ‘<i>SIXTEEN LEGS: Kinky Love</i>’ is a photographic journey through the ecology and reproductive biology of the Tasmanian Cave Spider, also in 44 page hardback.</p>
<p>If you choose the DELUXE option for the books, you'll get one of only 75 available sets signed by Neil Gaiman and a selection of the filmmakers, artists, scientists and other key production crew behind the film. We'll also throw in some of the archival production posters and postcards with this option. This is the ultimate pack for an individual supporter!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1604045581/owhngi5tgfyj6sol3gbo.jpg"" src=""""/>In collaboration with supporters who choose the web exclusives option (also included with the books), we will develop the online community resource from the hundreds of hours of additional expert interviews, public comments, and extensive cave and animal footage that were left on the cutting room floor. This is an enormously valuable archive with significant educational benefits, and we'd love to make it accessible.</p>
<p>We'll also have watch parties and online Q&amp;A sessions through this community resource. This component will be as big as you can help us make it: the further we go over our $20,000 target, the more comprehensive, vibrant and interactive this exciting resource can be!</p>
<p>There are also reward options to support school engagement with the project. You can support a local school with the donation of a  curriculum aligned education pack of <i>SIXTEEN LEGS</i> materials. We’ll send your nominated school (or, if you prefer, one we choose on your behalf) a tailored educational pack including online community access with special school-specific educational opportunities including student Q&amp;A sessions with the filmmakers and scientists behind the project, and opportunities to submit materials for the updated touring <i>SIXTEEN LEGS</i> exhibition in 2021-2022.</p>
<p>If you want to sponsor a swathe of schools to be involved, we're offering a mega-sponsorship option for 15 schools, with a discounted rate per school. We'll include additional expert support with this option to curate a special sponsor-named component of the touring exhibition (above) from your cluster of schools, and will work with you to tailor a school package that meets your philanthropic and sponsorship needs. Contact us for more details at info@bookendtrust.com</p>

<p><strong>THE FILM</strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Featuring: Neil Gaiman, Kate Miller-Heidke, Stephen Fry, Tara Moss, Adam Hills, Mark Gatiss and scientific researchers and experts from around the globe. </i></strong></p>
<p>Journey into a world like no other, where giant prehistoric spiders the size of dinner plates seek kinky love in the dark. As the world rapidly descends into the next period of global mass extinction, a message of hope comes from an unlikely hero: a creature, often unfairly reviled, that has survived prior mass extinctions and climatic change in a magical ecosystem hidden beneath the World Heritage mountains of one of the world's last great wildernesses. With spectacular imagery and a dark-fantasy twist by master story-teller Neil Gaiman, this real-world “<i>Charlotte’s Web</i>” brings a story of stability and solitude into our world of rapid change. Award-winning cinematography documents the 25th anniversary of scientific research into animals that outlasted the dinosaurs, survived the splitting of the continents and have endured the entirety of human civilisation in Australia’s deepest caves. From the visually stunning wilderness of Tasmania to an underworld few people have seen, this film excites and inspires modern audiences with the joy of adventure in the natural world, and celebrates the wonder of an ecosystem that preceded us and may still outlast us.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are passionate about helping people understand and appreciate the world around them, whether they are students, researchers or members of the wider community. There are so many untold stories in the natural world, and we also face a lot of challenges in ensuring the ongoing survival of these unusual species and places. People cannot value what they do not know about, and likewise people disengage from constant stories of doom and gloom if they cannot see the beauty, fascination and even humour behind these unusual stories. While this specific story is about an unusual ecosystem in Tasmania, has connections and importance that span the globe. But more than that, it shows us that every part of the planet has its own story. If this story inspires the next generation to look and learn about unknown things in their own backyards, the world will be a better place.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risk to this project is minimal, given that the film already exists in its theatrical and broadcast forms. So too do most of the extra materials that will be added to the physical discs. Aside from some minor editing and layout work, delivery of the film is mostly a process of mass production of what we already have in hand, which is why this is the major part of the target cost. The biggest risk is therefore one of delivery time rather than delivery itself.  While we aim to send the first discs out before Christmas, the world is currently subject to changing timelines due to Covid-19. It is possible that an outbreak or issue in the supply chain or delivery services may extend these project timelines. However, if we are successfully funded they will still go ahead.</p>
<p>Similar risks may apply to the creation and development of the online multimedia resource, but as a digital-only project, that will be less prone to physical disruption.</p>
<p>Bookend has been running logistically challenging projects for nearly fifteen years. Over the past seven years, we have not only managed conservation and education projects from Fiji to Antarctica, but we have also managed an intensive seven year documentary production schedule. From working in the difficult and dangerous environment of Australia's deepest caves through to delivering final prints of the film in a range of formats to a range of countries for cinema, television, film festival and exhibition screenings, we're definitely up to the challenge of adding DVD and Blu-Ray production to that list. :)</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hidden beneath the World Heritage mountains of Tasmania, giant prehistoric spiders the size of dinner plates seek kinky love in the dark... Neil Gaiman brings a real-world “Charlotte’s Web” into our world of rapid change. Through award-winning cinematography, SIXTEEN LEGS looks at the challenge, humour and science of capturing something never-before-filmed, against all the odds!
We are a group of biologists and educators working with some of the most unusual animals and in some of the most remote places on the planet. We've also provided opportunities for students working on positive environmental projects from Fiji to Antarctica. Over seven years, we produced SIXTEEN LEGS, a documentary about the life-cycle of giant prehistoric spiders still living in Australia's deepest caves. This project has received international acclaim and awards, and this has allowed us to educate and entertain people around the globe with the difficulties of underground life. Having produced versions of the film for cinema, television and exhibitions, we now wish to produce a Special Edition Blu-Ray and DVD set of this film that includes the full theatrical and main broadcast versions (including a special shorter version designed for younger audiences), as well as behind the scenes making of material. We also want to use the wealth of unused natural history footage, interviews with global experts, and additional popular culture material to produce a fun and fascinating online multimedia resource on caves, spiders, and the underground realm for schools and the public. We're inviting you to be a part of the next stages of this exciting project. Our resources are always stretched between our environmental and educational work, and your contributions will play a major role in taking SIXTEEN LEGS into the next big steps of its multi-legged journey.


What We Need & What You Get
The film and its broadcast variants are already complete, so no additional funding is required for production. However, we need to raise a minimum of $20,000 to make the Special Edition release viable. Of this amount, about 50% will go to factory mastering and pressing of the double disc Blu-Ray and DVD sets, including PAL and NTSC options for supporters (see FAQ). About 15% will go to formal rating and classification of the variants of the documentary and the extra features, and licensing. Editing will take another 15%, and about 7.5% each will go to third-party licensing and design. The final 5% is the platform fee for Indiegogo. These amounts will let us reach the minimum Special Edition production costs, as well as baseline editing for the online multimedia resource. Any funds over and above $20,000 will provide more detailed editing work on the online resources, which will get bigger and better with the more support we receive.

In return for helping this great educational cause, you get your own copy of the film - whether as the standard 98 minute theatrical version for online streaming, or the Special Edition Collection on your choice of DVD or Blu-Ray. The DVD will be a two-disc set featuring the full 98 minute theatrical version of the film, plus a special 1x 50 minute broadcast version of the film edited to better suit younger audiences. The Blu-Ray will upgrade the first disc of the set to the full HD Blu-Ray format, and will also include a special alternate 2x 50 minute broadcast version of the feature film. (This will be made available to DVD supporters as an online extra). Both the DVD and Blu-Ray sets will include the award-winning behind the scenes film '16 Legs: Spider Love' as well as additional featurettes on overcoming arachnophobia, the story of the SIXTEEN LEGS concept, the music of SIXTEEN LEGS, and trailers. There will also be a viewing guide to assist educators in showing the film to students.
As a special incentive to order early, we are offering a discount early-bird price until 10 November for the first 200 DVD sets, the first 200 Blu-Ray sets, and the first 200 sets of either that are coupled with online community option. These early-bird options also include the opportunity to get a name-checked 'thank you' on the discs, and we will also aim to get the first batch of discs sent out for Christmas (Covid-19 delivery times allowing). The earlier you order, the better your chances of that happening!


As well as the film, there are also additional rewards and benefits available, including packages of 2x hardback books showcasing the artwork and photography of the film. ‘SIXTEEN LEGS: A Visit to the Queen of the Dark’ is a 44 page hardback showcasing expanded versions of Jodee Taylah’s superb production art from the film and the SIXTEEN LEGS: Enter the Cave Exhibition, alongside the story components that were then under development with Neil Gaiman, Niall Doran and Craig Wellington. The book also contains the scientific background to the story, a glimpse behind the research and personal reflections on the involvement of the participants above. ‘SIXTEEN LEGS: Kinky Love’ is a photographic journey through the ecology and reproductive biology of the Tasmanian Cave Spider, also in 44 page hardback.
If you choose the DELUXE option for the books, you'll get one of only 75 available sets signed by Neil Gaiman and a selection of the filmmakers, artists, scientists and other key production crew behind the film. We'll also throw in some of the archival production posters and postcards with this option. This is the ultimate pack for an individual supporter!
In collaboration with supporters who choose the web exclusives option (also included with the books), we will develop the online community resource from the hundreds of hours of additional expert interviews, public comments, and extensive cave and animal footage that were left on the cutting room floor. This is an enormously valuable archive with significant educational benefits, and we'd love to make it accessible.
We'll also have watch parties and online Q&A sessions through this community resource. This component will be as big as you can help us make it: the further we go over our $20,000 target, the more comprehensive, vibrant and interactive this exciting resource can be!
There are also reward options to support school engagement with the project. You can support a local school with the donation of a  curriculum aligned education pack of SIXTEEN LEGS materials. We’ll send your nominated school (or, if you prefer, one we choose on your behalf) a tailored educational pack including online community access with special school-specific educational opportunities including student Q&A sessions with the filmmakers and scientists behind the project, and opportunities to submit materials for the updated touring SIXTEEN LEGS exhibition in 2021-2022.
If you want to sponsor a swathe of schools to be involved, we're offering a mega-sponsorship option for 15 schools, with a discounted rate per school. We'll include additional expert support with this option to curate a special sponsor-named component of the touring exhibition (above) from your cluster of schools, and will work with you to tailor a school package that meets your philanthropic and sponsorship needs. Contact us for more details at info@bookendtrust.com
For more information on the rewards, please see the photos of reward inclusions at the bottom of this project description, or in the reward categories in the side bar!
UPDATE 26 NOVEMBER: 4x NEW REWARDS HAVE BEEN ADDED FOR BLACK FRIDAY, including a beautiful glowworm book, art and photo cards, a limited edition mug (out of print since 2019), promotional posters, and a mountain book combo signed by the author. See Project Update #6 and the reward photos for more details.
UPDATE 7 DECEMBER: We've hit our target ahead of time, but a few more sales will really help us boost the design of the online educational archive, so we're offering a BONUS filmmakers' commentary track with the warts & all behind-the-scenes goss on the enormous challenges of making of the film if we can hit our stretch goal at AUD$25k!!!!

If we reach our goal quickly, the film's co-directors are also promising to record a special online commentary on the film as the first stretch goal, with exclusive behind the scenes details on the trials and tribulations of seven years of production, warts and all.

THE FILM
Featuring: Neil Gaiman, Kate Miller-Heidke, Stephen Fry, Tara Moss, Adam Hills, Mark Gatiss and scientific researchers and experts from around the globe. 
Journey into a world like no other, where giant prehistoric spiders the size of dinner plates seek kinky love in the dark. As the world rapidly descends into the next period of global mass extinction, a message of hope comes from an unlikely hero: a creature, often unfairly reviled, that has survived prior mass extinctions and climatic change in a magical ecosystem hidden beneath the World Heritage mountains of one of the world's last great wildernesses. With spectacular imagery and a dark-fantasy twist by master story-teller Neil Gaiman, this real-world “Charlotte’s Web” brings a story of stability and solitude into our world of rapid change. Award-winning cinematography documents the 25th anniversary of scientific research into animals that outlasted the dinosaurs, survived the splitting of the continents and have endured the entirety of human civilisation in Australia’s deepest caves. From the visually stunning wilderness of Tasmania to an underworld few people have seen, this film excites and inspires modern audiences with the joy of adventure in the natural world, and celebrates the wonder of an ecosystem that preceded us and may still outlast us.

REVIEW QUOTES


“A playful, stunning documentary... as epically gorgeous as it is fantastically artful.” – Edhat Review, Santa Barbara International Film Festival. 


“A beautiful nature documentary, expertly presented... a masterful feat captured with resonance!” – True/False Film Festival. 


“Your story brought a charming, creative and delightfully humanizing dimension to spiders which - from the survey comments we've seen so far - audiences enjoyed immensely.” – Barbara Stauffer, Session Chair – Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History (D.C). 


“I don’t think it could ever be said that the work of Attenborough will at any point be irrelevant – but, like all art, there is always room for adaptation and imagination. SIXTEEN LEGS arguably does just that.” – Wild Melbourne Review, Melbourne test screening of the rough cut.


""Even those of you who don't like spiders will find this story so charming... It's beautiful. They are so elegant, and they move so gently. Astonishing creatures, fascinating!"" Gillian O'Shaughnessy, ABC Radio Perth.

""This documentary has got rave reviews around the world... You're not overselling it, it looks spectacular!"" Jules Schiller, ABC Radio Adelaide.

""Mission accomplished: you've changed my mind. I will give spiders a second chance... I like them now. It's happened!"" Teri Campbell, RTR FM 92.1 Perth.

“Giant Tasmanian Cave Spiders and NEIL GAIMAN!! What more could you possibly want???” – GEORGE R.R. MARTIN (Game of Thrones).

Not only has it led most of us to isolation and changed the way we used to carry out our day to day activities, but in a move to follow the guidelines laid out, businesses have suffered and have had to lay off employees, send them on paid leave, go through cut backs on certain services, or even kept workers on but without any pay in the meantime.</p>
<p>This loss of income has pushed some people over the edge resulting into instances such as stress and depression, homelessness, conflicts within homes and amongst friends, and crime as we all adjust to this new normal of staying at home to stay safe, harsh economic times, unemployment and a disease that is running unchecked. With little to no hope for the future as far as most people are concerned and a prevailing culture of being used to doing manual, physical jobs that in most cases cannot be continued at home, many people’s lives have been drastically changed with mental health cases being on the rise.</p>
<p>Hello, my name is Cameron Hicks and I am a screenwriter, director, and film student at San Francisco State University. I am here to seek your financial support, which will help me create <strong>A Figment of My Exaggeration -</strong> <strong><i>a non-fiction, comedy documentary short film</i></strong> that will explore the implications that the pandemic has on mental health using humor and help people gain a better understanding of mental health within our environment. The documentary will highlight a group of fictional characters discussing problems of 2020 including the <i>COVID-19 pandemic</i>, <i>relationship struggles</i>, <i>making money</i>, <i>depression</i>, and <i>conspiracy theories</i>.</p>
<p>The characters involved will be <i>Kayla</i> who is using the pandemic to make money through sponsors from TikTok and Instagram, <i>Ashley</i> and <i>Sam </i>who are a couple that moved in together during the pandemic, <i>KC</i> who’s dealing with depression because of Covid, <i>Shayla</i> who’s working overtime to make money but she’s exhausted and becoming hungry, and <i>Kevin</i> who’s a conspiracy theorist. What’s more, the film will be highlighted by two non-profit organizations Art with Impact and Dakar Foundation that are both foundations which use art to highlight social justice and mental health. </p>
<p>Please support me in making this short film a reality and help raise the awareness of mental health through humor. Thank you again from the bottom of my heart for your support and please remember that every donation helps no matter how big or how small. Together we can make a difference during these uncertain times. I wish you all good health and stay safe.</p>

A group of soldiers are lost behind enemy lines in the Italian wilderness. Pursued by an axis brigade, they fight to make it back to safety and go back home.
We need your help to make WWII movie making history. Claim a perk and join our team!

The Impact
Over 500,000 Hispanic Americans served in the U.S. Armed Forces during World War II

This will be the first feature film to focus on latino soldiers in WW2
We have started shooting and will complete the film. Six of our previous films have all been released.
We will provide daily updates on all our progress.



What We Need & What You Get
In order to bring this film to light we need community support and teamwork.

The funding we gather will be used to directly help with production costs: sound and music, actor and crew wages, self distribution costs. 
We have many unique perks including memorabilia, autographs, screen credits and more!
If we don't reach our goal, we'll still pursue finishing the project.


Risks & Challenges
There are many risks in crowdfunding, especially in the film community.

""What if the movie never gets finished?"" - We've released six feature films so far, two of which were crowdfunded. Those projects are all available on multiple streaming sites and dvd.
""How long will it take before i get my perks?""- It takes about a full year to complete and release a feature film. However, the more post production funding we gather, the more it'll help with hiring top talent to complete tasks efficiently.

<p><i>The lyric video you see above is the song ""The Only"" which features prominently in the film. <br/><br/>TURN UP THE NIGHT to be directed by Melodie Roehrig (FANG, Bottom Feeders) and is written by Rick Masi (On the Level, I Saw Red, &amp; the award winning Tales of Darkened Light). </i><br/><br/><u><strong>INTRO (Our Story)</strong></u><br/>Hi. I’m Rick Masi - I’m the writer and Executive Producer of the 80’s hair band film, Turn Up the Night.  The year is 1992, it’s February - I am 5 years old, sitting on the floor of my parents living room in Buffalo, NY - my older brother is watching MTV - and this was when ""Music Television"" actually played music videos - and on our TV is the music video for “November Rain” by Guns N’ Roses. A 9 minute epic of a song.. and 9 minute spectacle of a music video. And even at 5 years old - I realized this was the coolest thing I’d ever seen. This blew the doors open for me and I took a deep dive into all of the classic bands of the 80’s hard rock and hair metal genre. Motley Crue, Bon Jovi, Winger, Ratt, Dokken, Winger, Skid Row, L.A. Guns, and the list goes on..</p>
<p>Years later, it would inspire the story which is ""Turn Up the Night"" - a story about the rise and falls of an 80's hard rock / ""hair band"" named Boy Elroy.</p>
<p><u><strong>OUR ASK (1st Verse)</strong></u><br/>The reason we’re making this campaign is because we are *this* close to making this film and dream a reality - but the honest and humble truth is - we need some help. WE NEED YOUR HELP.<br/><br/>And I’m sure you have many questions. Your first impression is ""Wow, that's a big ask. How do I know if it’s worth it? Where does all of the money go to - I don’t want to be swindled by somebody I don’t know. What do I get out of the deal?""..<br/><br/>Well, We're going to try and answer all those questions for you.</p>
<p><u><strong>WHAT IS IT ABOUT? (2nd Verse)</strong></u><br/>So, first question - what is ""Turn Up the Night"" and what is it about? As I mentioned earlier - it is a film about the rise and fall of (fictional) 80’s hard rock band, Boy Elroy. It’s a band we created for the film - (think along the lines of Bon Jovi, Motley Crue, LA Guns, etc). But how is this film different than what’s out there - ""I’ve seen ""Spinal Tap"" and I’ve seen ""The Dirt"", how is this different?"". Well, to start - we have a completely original soundtrack of “new” 80’s music  performed by virtuosos in their fields. In fact, in conjunction with the release of this campaign, we’ve released a lyric and concept video on our Facebook page of one of the original songs from the film called “The Only”.  <br/><br/>I don’t know about you - but I think the song is pretty rad. But you’re probably wondering - why tell a story like this? Because at it’s core - what it’s about is a story of individuality.. and to bring everything full circle, it’s a story about finding your purpose. You see there’s this element of the story we discuss a concept called a “golden prison”. It’s when you’ve gotten everything you’ve ever wanted - but you’re shackled by it. We also explore the striping of one’s identity by the big corporate music machine… when people become products. But by the end of this movie we want people to feel empowered that they have some control over their lives.<br/><br/><u><strong>WHAT &amp; WHERE YOUR MONEY GOES TO (Chorus)</strong></u><br/>So the biggest elephant in the room - is where does the money go to! Well, we came fully prepared for that question - and I brought some pictures to back me up.<br/><br/>So we’ve estimated that to pull this off in the most ideal and comfortable fashion would be to have a budget of approximately <strong>$10,000</strong>. To explain the breakdown.<br/><br/>Right off the Bat; Over half of that proposed budget is expected to be paid to our <strong>Crew</strong> over the course of a 10-12 day period. These are people like our directors of photography, our crew, our sound people, set managers, production assistants, and our director. These are extremely hard working people, who are eager to get back into a COVID-free and safe filming environment. They all deserve to be paid for their expertise and the time they spend for their hard work. 2020 was tough for a lot of people - but we've got a deeply resilient bunch of people involved in this project. Every single one of them has the drive to make it happen come hell or high water. <br/><br/>Next is our <strong>Cast</strong>. We have a close tight-nit group of talented actors who have been preparing to take on this film for approximately 2 years. We want to pay them adequate daily rates - again, hard working people who need to make a living.<br/><br/>Also, our <strong>Musicians</strong> - with whom we wouldn’t be able to do any of this without. They are some of the true behind the scenes heroes of the film. With a film revolving entirely around music - they will always be at the core of this film. They deserve to be paid. </p> <p><strong>Craft Services</strong> - with all of those long days; people need to eat.

I’m Rick Masi - I’m the writer and Executive Producer of the 80’s hair band film, Turn Up the Night.  The year is 1992, it’s February - I am 5 years old, sitting on the floor of my parents living room in Buffalo, NY - my older brother is watching MTV - and this was when ""Music Television"" actually played music videos - and on our TV is the music video for “November Rain” by Guns N’ Roses. A 9 minute epic of a song.. and 9 minute spectacle of a music video. And even at 5 years old - I realized this was the coolest thing I’d ever seen. This blew the doors open for me and I took a deep dive into all of the classic bands of the 80’s hard rock and hair metal genre. Motley Crue, Bon Jovi, Winger, Ratt, Dokken, Winger, Skid Row, L.A. Guns, and the list goes on..
Years later, it would inspire the story which is ""Turn Up the Night"" - a story about the rise and falls of an 80's hard rock / ""hair band"" named Boy Elroy.
OUR ASK (1st Verse)The reason we’re making this campaign is because we are *this* close to making this film and dream a reality - but the honest and humble truth is - we need some help. WE NEED YOUR HELP.And I’m sure you have many questions. Your first impression is ""Wow, that's a big ask. How do I know if it’s worth it? Where does all of the money go to - I don’t want to be swindled by somebody I don’t know. What do I get out of the deal?""..Well, We're going to try and answer all those questions for you.
WHAT IS IT ABOUT? (2nd Verse)So, first question - what is ""Turn Up the Night"" and what is it about? As I mentioned earlier - it is a film about the rise and fall of (fictional) 80’s hard rock band, Boy Elroy. It’s a band we created for the film - (think along the lines of Bon Jovi, Motley Crue, LA Guns, etc). But how is this film different than what’s out there - ""I’ve seen ""Spinal Tap"" and I’ve seen ""The Dirt"", how is this different?"". Well, to start - we have a completely original soundtrack of “new” 80’s music  performed by virtuosos in their fields. In fact, in conjunction with the release of this campaign, we’ve released a lyric and concept video on our Facebook page of one of the original songs from the film called “The Only”.  I don’t know about you - but I think the song is pretty rad. But you’re probably wondering - why tell a story like this? Because at it’s core - what it’s about is a story of individuality.. and to bring everything full circle, it’s a story about finding your purpose. You see there’s this element of the story we discuss a concept called a “golden prison”. It’s when you’ve gotten everything you’ve ever wanted - but you’re shackled by it. We also explore the striping of one’s identity by the big corporate music machine… when people become products. But by the end of this movie we want people to feel empowered that they have some control over their lives.WHAT & WHERE YOUR MONEY GOES TO (Chorus)So the biggest elephant in the room - is where does the money go to! Well, we came fully prepared for that question - and I brought some pictures to back me up.So we’ve estimated that to pull this off in the most ideal and comfortable fashion would be to have a budget of approximately $10,000. To explain the breakdown.Right off the Bat; Over half of that proposed budget is expected to be paid to our Crew over the course of a 10-12 day period. These are people like our directors of photography, our crew, our sound people, set managers, production assistants, and our director. These are extremely hard working people, who are eager to get back into a COVID-free and safe filming environment. They all deserve to be paid for their expertise and the time they spend for their hard work. 2020 was tough for a lot of people - but we've got a deeply resilient bunch of people involved in this project. Every single one of them has the drive to make it happen come hell or high water. Next is our Cast. We have a close tight-nit group of talented actors who have been preparing to take on this film for approximately 2 years. We want to pay them adequate daily rates - again, hard working people who need to make a living.Also, our Musicians - with whom we wouldn’t be able to do any of this without. They are some of the true behind the scenes heroes of the film. With a film revolving entirely around music - they will always be at the core of this film. They deserve to be paid.  Craft Services - with all of those long days; people need to eat. Additionally with new COVID guidelines - we want to have a Covid safe set - and that requires some additional sanitary items, like sanitizer, wipes, and additional masks.  We take the pandemic seriously, and want our team feeling safe. 
Next we have Rentals - some authentic looking locations like studios or office buildings require an hourly rate. We want to be able to have access to the most realistic and authentic sets.Here’s a very important one - Wigs and Wardrobe - this is what keeps you invested in the movie. You want to see a movie about the 80’s that looks like it was made in the 80’s. We can’t skimp on wigs and wardrobe - they are characters in and of themselves.And lastly, there are smaller Miscellaneous expenses we will need to take care of; things like props, marketing, rentals or supplies for the cast and crew.
OUR ASK AND WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU (Outro, repeats until end)So again, what are we asking - we are asking that you consider donating to our film. And I get it - I am very much aware of what kind of an “ask” that is. These times have been weird to say the least. We understand the value of your hard earned money. That is why every tier of donation comes with a specific perk - and they range from all shapes and sizes.

<p><strong>About The Project</strong></p>
<p>Hi, my name is Nick Acosta. I am an avid horror fan, a YouTube content creator, and a filmmaker. I have been watching and talking about movies throughout my entire life. I became a fan of the horror genre when I was 6 years old and have always been fascinated with storytelling and allegories based on real life tragedy and events. It’s because of my own personal experience with almost losing my brother to a drug overdose in the year 2017, that I decided to write this film. </p>
<p>Addict tells the story of Daniel, a recently sober drug addict who falls back into a relapse and is stalked by a terrifying and disturbing entity. </p>
<p>Your contribution will help me have the creative freedom to tell the story that I have been planning for over the last 4 years. </p> <p><strong>How You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>I am hoping to raise $4,000 for the project through this campaign. These contributions will go towards the equipment, the talent in front of and behind the camera, location expenses, travel expenses for shooting, catering for the crew during production, and festival submission fees.

<p>Social media is getting worse every day when you're trying to to spread the word and it has become a total pay to reach your audiences service, which makes it even harder to let you all know about fun projects like this.

<h3>13th: Awakening</h3>
<p>Hello my fellow Fiends!</p>
<p>I've been working hard on putting this project together for some time and I hope you will want to be a part of helping to bring this film to life!</p>
<p>Did you see the 13 second teaser I posted and are you a fan of Friday The 13th?</p>
<p>That 13 seconds was actually a lot of work. And making a fan film, short or hopeful feature length is in the works and I would love your support to make it happen.</p>
<p>Why ""13th: Awakening"" ?</p>
<p>There have been 12 Friday The 13th movies made, and it's been well over a decade since the last! It's time to awaken Jason for the 13th time! This tale is about revenge, the conjuring of Jason's spirit as well as his mask and machete to lend a girl sick of being abused, the tools and the power to seek vengeance.  It's going to be a killer good time!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Making it happen with your support!</h3>
<p>We want to make it awesome for you to enjoy! Making a film is no easy task and it's not cheap. The crew and I are looking for support from you to help with the films budget to pay for things like; lighting, generators, hard drives, media storage etc. As well as other camera gear, rentals and supplies for effects and so much more.</p>
<p>The more we raise, the more blood, kills and thrills we can provide for your creepy little hearts. The goal amount set will cover our basic production costs, but surpassing this goal means more flexibility to bring you more horror and more perks! </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What YOUR support means to us</h3>
<p>Quite simply... your help means everything!</p>
<p>Are you a fan of Friday The 13th?</p>

<h3>There you found me is a powerful story of how a single prayer brought two men together in a way they never thought possible.</h3>
<p>Meet Sheldon. He was a beautiful soul, my best friend and someone I loved more than words can express. He was a brother. A guide. An Influencer. An Encourager. He loved God so very much and his love and connection for people was masterful. He touched everyone who ever came into his life and his voice was like butter. You could listen to the man sing for hours on stage. Sheldon was deeply loved by all who met him. It was impossible not to love him instantly.</p>
<p>In 2007, I met him at the Savannah Theatre for the first time. And from then, I didn't realize how much we needed each other.</p>

<p>My name is <strong>Jonathan Brent Burgard</strong> and I have been a creative for over 20 years. I am the writer and producer of <i>There You Found Me</i> and from performing on stage and film to producing live shows, it has been my dream to write and produce my very first film. This is an endeavor I never thought possible and one I never thought I could pull off. But then I wrote it and I began to realize how hungry the hearts and minds of people are for a story that defies the status quo and reinvents love in a way we haven't seen in a long time.</p>

<h3>Our project:</h3>
<p><i>CANCR Synopsis:</i> Tomas lives in a world made small by the disruption of cancer treatment. Now in remission, Tomas meets Dustin on Cancr, the dating app for people who have the disease. Dustin (Single. Musician. Currently staying in the burbs. #incurable) is by turns silly and serious, but always honest. Their connection may be brief, but the care and understanding that passes between them opens something new for both young men.</p>
<p><i>Director’s statement:</i> I’m so thrilled to put this tender story on screen. Building off Zak Payne’s script, which is filled with subtleties, humor, and a deep respect for consentful intimacy, we filmed so that the camera mirrors Tomas’ progress from claustrophobic to expansive as he learns about self-acceptance. </p>
<p>We have assembled an awesome team of creatives from the LGBTQ community in Chicago. We committed to making it a collaborative and positive growth opportunity for everyone involved. We hired crew who were enthusiastic about the project. Most identify as LGBTQ and BIPOC. Our filming spanned only three days (pre-COVID-19), yet the safe environment on set allowed everyone to reach deep into their respective reservoirs of honesty, vulnerability, and empathy to create a moving piece of art. All that remains is for the post team to continue that hard, beautiful work to translate the footage into the best visual and auditory story it can be.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Mountain V Productions presents The Shoreline Crime, a short film with an interlocking narrative that will captivate and shock audiences from beginning to end. </p>
<p>In a sleepy beach town, college students Jenna and Katie have always admired how Alexis ruled the men she found on dating apps and allegedly ended up leaving the town with a rich guy. The two girls pressure their roommate Katie to try it out and get new experiences, but without realizing it, they have become victims of cybercrime (Catfishing) and lured into a new venture that will change their lives forever. Meanwhile, bereaved former detective John moves to the area and quickly ends up throwing himself into a private investigation of a missing woman. He befriends the well connected local bar owner Leo who helps build up his case. But the more information John uncovers about the missing woman and the newcomers in town, he’ll soon realize this investigation will redefine his principles of justice. </p>

<h2>A Film for Awareness</h2>
<p>The end goal of The Shoreline Crime is not only to provide audiences with a thrilling narrative, but also to bring attention to the disturbing rise of catfishing in the United States. </p>
<p>According to the FBI, $218,000,000 was lost as a result of romance scams in 2017 alone. That number increased nearly three times in 2020, with the FBI reporting a loss of nearly $600,000,000. However, financial loss is not the only casualty in this ever increasing epidemic. Catfishing victims commonly suffer from a variety of emotional turmoil's, including fear, anxiety, depression and a diminished trust in others. Not to mention that 1 in 4 Americans use online dating, making it the most popular method of finding a romantic partner.</p>

Key team.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>A student made short film about the horrors a child stolen from the world faces raised by murderers in an underground bunker. </p>
<ul>
<li>My name is Stephen Donley and I'm a Senior at Huntington University!</li>
<li>I'm very excited to get to work on this film. I'm incredibly excited to work on this project because it's the first real set I'm building and have grand visions for my script.</li>
<li>My contributors will help me and my close hard-working peers create our dream film which we will be able to submit to festivals to show our talent off to its fullest ability.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We have received money from our executive producers to get us off the ground but we are striving for another thousand. </li>
<li>Perks donators receive are credits at the end and our short film. You'll receive the film in its entirety once it's finished and after festivals have judged it. I don't have much more to offer other than our best!</li>
<li>Funds are going to go to many things. Specifically and the majority will go to props. Our set is going to be rich with flavor and life telling an entire story on its own visually. The build is already taking place and its intention is to create what looks like a cargo box buried underground. Inside are going to be wooden paneling for walls, various objects plastered on the walls, carpets and crushed cans littering the floor, Christmas lights illuminating the long thin home, and a large eery deer head mounted on the wall. Apart from the set, we have various props as well including three custom-made environmental safety suits used for when they go outside the bunker, a woodcutter's ax, and a closet of newspapers for a big reveal near the end.</li>
<li>Outside the actually set we'll have 30 hungry mouths to feed for our three-day shoot and professional actors to house. All and all it's going to add up to a hefty budget, but I have confidence it will all be worth the cost. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our project is imperative for today's viewers. It represents a child's fight for truth and their own freedom and it creates a genuine narrative of someone trapped inside the same room for many years of their youth. </li>
<li>I've gathered the best of the best from our grade and we have full confidence in our abilities to show off the school's and more so our capabilities.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I'm worried about the amount of time we have before we have to shoot. My film has to come together and be ready to hit the ground running on October 8th. After that, we have until October 10th to finish shooting.</p>
<ul><li>Other than the rapidly approaching deadline I have no reason to doubt my team. Funding from our generous donators would only help in securing our production concretely.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't donate no worries! You would be doing us a colossal favor if you would spread the word and post our project on social media or send it to any people you think would be interested.</p>
<p>Even if you can only offer us yourself as an audience member, we would be forever grateful. Thank you.</p>

I've gathered the best of the best from our grade and we have full confidence in our abilities to show off the school's and more so our capabilities.


Risks & Challenges
I'm worried about the amount of time we have before we have to shoot. My film has to come together and be ready to hit the ground running on October 8th. After that, we have until October 10th to finish shooting.
Other than the rapidly approaching deadline I have no reason to doubt my team. Funding from our generous donators would only help in securing our production concretely.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't donate no worries! You would be doing us a colossal favor if you would spread the word and post our project on social media or send it to any people you think would be interested.
Even if you can only offer us yourself as an audience member, we would be forever grateful. Thank you.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Though he has been solidified as a  horror icon for nearly forty years, none of his films have been more controversial than Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday.Twenty five years later, we want to shed some light on this incredibly polarizing installment.  Love it or hate it, we are setting out to get some answers for YOU, the fans! Why were some of those creative choices made?  Why was Jason a non-character in his own franchise film? Why on earth would a huge studio like New Line Cinema choose to put this legendary, blockbuster horror fan-favorite in the hands of a 23-year old Writer/Director Adam Marcus, who had NEVER written or directed a studio film in his young career?!Well fans, you are in for a fun ride!  We've brought together an awesome team with much of the original cast and crew from the film, including Writer/Director Adam Marcus!  We (the team) aim to give fans and haters alike some raw insight into this controversial installment, as well as offer YOU the opportunity to ask your most burning questions to the cast and crew of Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday! Did you absolutely LOVE the film? Thought it was a super creative and unique addition to the franchise? Great! We are going to deliver some fantastic behind-the-scenes info on a film that you hold dear to your horror-fan heart!Absolutely HATE it? Thought it was the epitome of cinematic garbage? Great! Consider our So Many Questions perk and ask Adam Marcus ANYTHING. YOU. WANT.

My name is Julia Marchese and I am a filmmaker living in Los Angeles. My first film, 2016's Out of Print, is a documentary about the importance of revival cinema and 35mm exhibition and preservation to culture. It features interviews with filmmakers such as Rian Johnson, Edgar Wright, Kevin Smith, Joe Dante, Mark Romanek, John Landis, Stuart Gordon, Joe Carnahan, Tom Holland and many more. I was able to fund the film via Kickstarter and learned how to make a film by making a film -  from pre-production to  post-production, screenings, festivals, press and distribution, I went through every single step with passion for cinema and joy of learning.  Out of Print was shot half on film and half on digital, and I was so thrilled to have a 35mm print of the film made. The film won the Programmers Award at the Sidewalk Film Festival and has played at art house cinemas, universities and film archives all over the world. The film is available on DVD, Amazon Prime and streaming & the 35mm print is still touring the world, having just played the Film Archive in Austria earlier this year. The film print lives now at The Academy Film Archive in Hollywood between screenings. I am also a Constant Reader.                                                        I've loved Stephen King obsessively since I was about 11 years old, the girl on the bus furiously reading It and Carrie and Pet Sematary over and over. In junior high I enthusiastically made all my friends watch Pet Sematary and even dressed like Post-Micmac-Burial-Ground Gage Creed for Halloween one year as a kid. I'm hardcore. I realized two and half years ago that I had never tackled his master work, The Dark Tower series. This needed to be remedied immediately. So I devoured the books, loving each one more and more and starting to panic as I neared the end of the series. I didn't want the story to end!! I got to the 11th stanza in book 7 - The Song of Susannah (Constant Readers will know where I mean) where the reveal was going to be so good and I was so excited, that I needed to prolong that feeling as long as possible.                                    So I decided to pause my reading there and read every Stephen King novel and short story related to the The Dark Tower (there are A LOT, over 40 short stories and novels combined!) before re-reading the Tower series (and then continue on to the Marvel comic series omnibuses and The Dark Tower companions after that). It's taken me two and a half years so far and I am still working on it. It's the most incredibly brilliant literary multiverse puzzle that I have ever undertaken, and I am enjoying putting the pieces into place more than I can say.  I truly know and love Stephen King's work from a real, cherished place in my heart that has been in my life every day for a very long time.  Stephen King has an incredible program called the Dollar Baby Program, which allows the rights of certain stories of his to be bought for one dollar (and you really do send him a dollar bill in the mail)! The contract states that the rights are good for one year, and the resulting film must be 45 minutes or under, plus the film must be non-profit, non-broadcast - which means the film cannot be sold, but it can be shown at film festivals and in private screenings.  That means the only way you are guaranteed to see this film is to contribute to this campaign and get a private live stream link sent to you when the film is finished.  Perhaps the most exciting aspect of the contract is that Stephen King asks that all finished Dollar Baby films be sent to him to view - so dig this - he sells the rights to the stories for $1, basically because he's curious to see how other people view and interpret his work - how cool is that? Knowing that Stephen King himself will watch a film that you can be a part of is a pretty awesome and unique opportunity!                                                  I Know What You Need is a short story that was first featured in the September 1976 issue of Cosmopolitan Magazine, and then compiled into the short story collection Night Shift in 1978.

The film follows two women as they help animals find their Forever Homes.  Donna is a hairdresser who runs Susie’s Hope Animal Rescue in High Point, NC. With enormous vet bills and an overwhelming desire to help animals, Donna must be in a constant state of fundraising. If donations start to fall off will Donna be able to continue her life’s passion or will she succumb to financial weight as so many other rescue groups have?<br/>Linda lives in Cumming, GA and is a volunteer foster mom for Kodi’s Club Rottweiler Rescue based in Pennsylvania. Linda has just spent nine months rehabilitating Ruger. Now Linda must let go of him so he can finish his journey to his Forever Home. Will she be able to move past this emotionally draining experience and continue her work as a foster parent?<br/>Rescues takes an unflinching look at what it takes to work in this demanding field. Hopefully, the film will raise awareness of the financial and mental health support needs for those in the animal care field.</p><p><strong><u>Producer’s Statement</u></strong></p><p>Most of my best friends in my life have been dogs and for the most part my dogs have come from Rescues. Like most of the general public I assumed that animal rescue work must be a never-ending source of joy. They go into the shelter and pull any number of dogs and cats to shuttle off to waiting, caring families. Although those parts exist, there are horrors beyond that idyllic veil. This is one of the hardest jobs in the world. For the most part it is a voluntary occupation that is financially draining and emotionally taxing.

The film follows two women as they help animals find their Forever Homes.  Donna is a hairdresser who runs Susie’s Hope Animal Rescue in High Point, NC. With enormous vet bills and an overwhelming desire to help animals, Donna must be in a constant state of fundraising. If donations start to fall off will Donna be able to continue her life’s passion or will she succumb to financial weight as so many other rescue groups have?Linda lives in Cumming, GA and is a volunteer foster mom for Kodi’s Club Rottweiler Rescue based in Pennsylvania. Linda has just spent nine months rehabilitating Ruger. Now Linda must let go of him so he can finish his journey to his Forever Home. Will she be able to move past this emotionally draining experience and continue her work as a foster parent?Rescues takes an unflinching look at what it takes to work in this demanding field. Hopefully, the film will raise awareness of the financial and mental health support needs for those in the animal care field.Producer’s StatementMost of my best friends in my life have been dogs and for the most part my dogs have come from Rescues. Like most of the general public I assumed that animal rescue work must be a never-ending source of joy. They go into the shelter and pull any number of dogs and cats to shuttle off to waiting, caring families. Although those parts exist, there are horrors beyond that idyllic veil. This is one of the hardest jobs in the world. For the most part it is a voluntary occupation that is financially draining and emotionally taxing. Every year volunteers across the US will leave creating a vacuum of need for thousands of animals. It is my hope that this film will raise awareness of the issues facing those who bring us our best friends.GoalAfter two years of filming, and eight months of editing, I need $10,000 for color work and sound mixing.  Any additional funds will be used for festival entry fees, outreach programs, and educational screenings.RewardsThis is not a “merch” film.  The mission of this film is to raise awareness of the challenges facing animal rescue workers.  Therefore, the perks are not extravagant.   However, each pledge tier perk includes all lower tiers.  Ex.

<p>""She Does Not Smile"" is a film that deals with contemporary social topics through the lens of a love story. Comprised of a highly diverse and ambitious team, this film aims to bring awareness to US immigration policies during the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>
<p>Our team will create a film that celebrates diverse music while also tackling the everyday implications of pandemic-era US politics and the impact they had on international students.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Director's Statement</h3>
<p>As an Iranian international student in the US, I have experienced the limitation to see my family because of the travel ban policy which is imposed on some countries including Iran. This is the love story that reacts to the US immigration law which influenced the life of international students. On the other hand, Afghanistan and Iran (my homeland) are neighbor countries. These two countries have similar cultures, similar music, and similar languages. So, I am the right person to narrate this story with a taste of migration in the U.S. However, I do not want to just make a one-layer film. As the themes of this short are Love, Music, Students life, Pandemic, Politics, War, Iran, Afghanistan, and the US, this multi-layer story can be interesting for different audiences of different nationalities and ages around the world.</p>

<h3>Bishop's Cove is a Horror Film That Does Not Compromise</h3>
<p>Bishop's Cove is a dark and disturbing horror film, in the vein of <strong><i>Hellraiser</i></strong>, with aspects of <i><strong>Silent Hill</strong></i> and <i><strong>Requiem for a Dream</strong></i> mixed in. Written and directed by <strong>Charles D. Lincoln</strong>, it is a tale of Heather, played in 2020 by <strong>Emily McKinley Hill</strong>, and in 2001 by <strong>Willow Lautenberg</strong>, a successful architect with a loving fiancee, Kristen, played by <strong>Sarah Schoofs</strong>, and a happy life. A happy life she has built upon the ashes of her past, where she was a homeless squatter punk, living on streets of NYC, addicted to heroin, and in love with Catalonia, played by <strong>Anna Paulette</strong>. One day, Heather's bliss is shattered at the news that Cat, whom she hadn't heard from in over 15 years, has passed away. Heather is then asked to travel to the small upstate New York town Cat grew up in, Bishop's Cove, to deliver the ashes. While there, Heather will be confronted by demons both personal and, in the form of The Nameless, played by <strong>Chelsea LeSage</strong>, very very literal. Now, more than Heather's perfect life is in danger. Her soul is too. </p>
<p>Two years ago, we tried to get the project off the ground with the help of some investors. It appeared everything would be progressing smoothly until, right before shooting was to begin, they started asking for changes. Changes that we were not comfortable making because they would have changed the very nature of what we were trying to do. Can we make Catalonia a man? Can we take out the grittiness? Can we tone down the gore?</p>
<p>So many compromises were asked of us that it no longer felt like we'd be telling the same story, so we waited until we could afford to start it up on our own and in 2019, the time felt right. We have shot probably 30% of the film, out of pocket and with the help of friends and family. And most importantly, we've been doing it our way!</p>
<p>Here is the NSFW Hellscape scene we've been able to film along with a trailer of some of the ""real world"" scenes we've done. Keep in mind the score is temporary. But the scene will give you an idea of where we will go and what to expect in the completed film. </p>

<p> </p>
<h2>
<br/>BUT MOVIES ARE EXPENSIVE AND TO DO THIS RIGHT, WE NEED YOUR HELP!!</h2>
</div><div>
<p>We are asking for $20,000 to help pay for practical effects in several hellish scenes. We have been working with makeup artists Shannon Rae Mulligan and Leona Ross, as well as the SFX prop house Design to Deceive. We want to create a visually stunning yet upsetting hellscapes for Heather to find herself in. Upon entering Bishop's Cove, Heather is in danger both body and soul. Scenes filled with filth and gore, where hapless souls are stripped of their humanity and confronted by their worst fears. We have four to shoot, including a scene of Heather having to run naked across a hallway of broken glass while pursued by The Ceaseless, one of the Nameless' ""associates,"" who drags a corpse behind it that it uses as a bludgeoning tool. Another involves Heather being wheeled through a derelict hospital surrounded by souls upon whom involuntary surgeries are being performed by another of the Nameless' ""associates,"" The Heartless. Another involves Heather being confronted by a very macabre puppet show, where the corpses of her loved ones figure prominently.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1604231084/wmgscbiadtapttgwmcjm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Sketch of The Ceaseless, one of the demonic associates of The Nameless, played by Robert House</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1604231137/bb3qzawxbpgrjhcpnmkb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Sketch of The Heartless, played by Caitlin Ross-Poteet</i></p>
<p>But creating scenes like this won't be cheap for us. We are work quickly and we've made some great deals with Joshua Turi and the people at Design to Deceive, but to do these scenes properly, it will take more money than we can pay out of pocket. A typical day of shooting costs us $1,350 for our four person crew alone, and to do these effects, which we estimate will take place over several days of shooting, will require roughly $20,000. </p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">We want to be able to pay for props and prosthetics. Things like enough sugar glass to fill a hallway, prosthetic body parts, occasional studio rentals, latex injuries, gallons of fake blood all cost money. Sometimes, makeup is such a big job that an assistant needs to be hired. For the hospital set piece, we anticipate having to hire two assistants and devote Shannon and her assistant to the makeup of The Nameless, the Heartless, and their minions, while Leona and her assistant to makeup of Heather and the assembled suffering souls. Besides that, things like a proper gurney can cost around $520, not counting the additional fees required to make it look old and rusted.</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Besides makeup, we want to be able pay cast and crew their regular rate. While Charles, as producer and director is not receiving any payment for his work on this until a distribution deal is made, camera, gaffer, sound, and PA all need to be paid. Actors are also paid for each day they work for us.  </li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">We want to be able to be able to feed cast and crew. It is important that everybody be fed. In this age of Covid, extra precautions must also be taken to keep everyone safe. These can tack on additional fees. </li>
</ul>
<p>Practical effects are the key to making this film look the way we want it to look. It is very important to us that it not look cheesy or cheap and that parts that are supposed to terrify people do not cause them to laugh instead. As Indie filmmakers, we are used to doing a lot with a little and trust me, for some of the things we have in mind, $20,000 is very little.  If we don't get all of it, we'll still make things work to the best of our abilities, but cutting down some of our ideas may be very painful.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU?</h2>
<p>Besides being able to see a kickass horror film when it is done, we are offering a number of perks to those of you generous enough to contribute to our campaign.</p>
<ul>
<li>Those of you who contribute up to $10 will be able to know that you've made something of a difference in the lives of a scrappy family of indie filmmakers, intent on doing something awesome. While one $10 contribution won't set the world on fire, it is a start and you can feel good about yourself for making it.</li>
<li>For $20, we will put your name in a special thanks section of the credits, letting the world know you support indie horror.</li>
<li>For $35, not only will we put your name in the credits, we'll also send you a digital download of the film when we have finished the festival circuit. We estimate this to be around September 2022, but if it's later, you'll still receive it.</li>
<li>Those who contribute $50 will receive a physical edition of the film, in their choice of DVD or Blu-Ray, as well as thanks in the credits. As with the digital download, this will only come after the film is done with the festival circuit.</li>
<li>Those that contribute $75 will get that DVD or Blu-Ray signed by Charles  D. Lincoln, Chelsea LeSage, Emily McKinley Hill, and Anna Paulette. Possibly some bigger stars, but no promises... Of course, these contributors will be on the credits thanks list.</li>
<li>Now, at $100, things start to get interesting. Those that contribute at $100 will not only receive a signed DVD or Blu-Ray and a place in the credits, but they will be able to play, at a time and date of our choosing, an online session of the asymmetrical horror game Dead by Daylight, being hunted by The Nameless herself, Chelsea LeSage. You must own the game already but due to the game's crossplay nature, it will not matter if you own it on Playstation, Xbox, PC, or Switch. She will hunt you and three other contributors down in a session. </li>
<li>If you'd like to have the tables turned, at $200, you will not only receive the signed DVD or Blu-Ray, the place in the credits, but you'll be able to play a session of Dead by Daylight where you will be the killer and director/writer Charles D. Lincoln, and cast members Chelsea LeSage, Emily McKinley Hill, and Anna Paulette will all be survivors. You will get one chance to stop us from running the generators and escaping. Can you be a better hunter than The Nameless?</li>
<li>If you're feeling a bit adventurous, you can contribute $500, where the bad news is we won't be putting you in that special thanks list anymore.  The good news is that you will now be listed as an Associate Producer with full IMDB credit. On top of that, if you are able to travel to New York City (and pass a rapid Covid test after the proper waiting period), we will make you one of the tortured souls in one of our hell sequences. You too can be mutilated and mangled by the Nameless as part of our film! On top of that, you will receive the signed DVD or Blu-Ray!</li>
<li>At $750, you'll receive the same perks as those who contribute $500, but you'll also be allowed to keep one of the props from your scene! What will it be? Well, obviously, we won't know until you're here. But you will be able to keep one that'll go with your shiny new Associate Producer Credit and signed DVD or Blu Ray.</li>
<li>Finally, those who contribute at $1,000 will get the big one, if you're looking to be on the other side of the camera. Executive Producer credit. Not only will you greatly help us towards getting this thing done, you'll also have something you can use when getting involved in your own projects. Of course, you'll also get the signed DVD and Blu-Ray. Hell, you've earned it, at that point.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Independent film is not easy. It's putting out fire after fire, but we have a great cast and we have a reliable crew that are battle tested in dealing with the challenges that we are faced with. Our budget is very small, compared to some of the stuff you'd see coming out of Hollywood. We are passionate about what we're doing and we've had years of experience to help us get past any hurdles that may come in our way. Our only hurdle right now is funding.</p>
<p>If we don't receive it, we have to cut down on the effects, we have to cut down on the scale of some of our ideas, and the people who ultimately suffer are you, the independent horror fan who gets deprived of the experience we want to provide for you. We want to give you the same feelings we got when we saw Hellraiser or Martyrs for the first time. We want to bring you something where you'll care about the characters as much as you will be horrified by the ordeals they go through. We want to give you a vision of hell that mainstream cinema would find too disturbing to show you. We know what we're doing and we know how to do it. All we need it you to give us the means to do so. With so many of the cast and crew out of work during these past few months of Covid, being able to move ahead with funding and with drive will be exactly what we need and what we put together will be exactly what you need: an uncompromising piece of horror cinema, the likes of which you haven't seen in years! <br/><br/>But we can only do it with your help! Won't you help keep independent horror alive?</p>

</div></div>","Bishop's Cove is a Horror Film That Does Not Compromise
Bishop's Cove is a dark and disturbing horror film, in the vein of Hellraiser, with aspects of Silent Hill and Requiem for a Dream mixed in. Written and directed by Charles D. Lincoln, it is a tale of Heather, played in 2020 by Emily McKinley Hill, and in 2001 by Willow Lautenberg, a successful architect with a loving fiancee, Kristen, played by Sarah Schoofs, and a happy life. A happy life she has built upon the ashes of her past, where she was a homeless squatter punk, living on streets of NYC, addicted to heroin, and in love with Catalonia, played by Anna Paulette. One day, Heather's bliss is shattered at the news that Cat, whom she hadn't heard from in over 15 years, has passed away. Heather is then asked to travel to the small upstate New York town Cat grew up in, Bishop's Cove, to deliver the ashes. While there, Heather will be confronted by demons both personal and, in the form of The Nameless, played by Chelsea LeSage, very very literal. Now, more than Heather's perfect life is in danger. Her soul is too. 
Two years ago, we tried to get the project off the ground with the help of some investors. It appeared everything would be progressing smoothly until, right before shooting was to begin, they started asking for changes. Changes that we were not comfortable making because they would have changed the very nature of what we were trying to do. Can we make Catalonia a man? Can we take out the grittiness? Can we tone down the gore?
So many compromises were asked of us that it no longer felt like we'd be telling the same story, so we waited until we could afford to start it up on our own and in 2019, the time felt right. We have shot probably 30% of the film, out of pocket and with the help of friends and family. And most importantly, we've been doing it our way!
Here is the NSFW Hellscape scene we've been able to film along with a trailer of some of the ""real world"" scenes we've done. Keep in mind the score is temporary. But the scene will give you an idea of where we will go and what to expect in the completed film. 

 

BUT MOVIES ARE EXPENSIVE AND TO DO THIS RIGHT, WE NEED YOUR HELP!!

We are asking for $20,000 to help pay for practical effects in several hellish scenes. We have been working with makeup artists Shannon Rae Mulligan and Leona Ross, as well as the SFX prop house Design to Deceive. We want to create a visually stunning yet upsetting hellscapes for Heather to find herself in. Upon entering Bishop's Cove, Heather is in danger both body and soul. Scenes filled with filth and gore, where hapless souls are stripped of their humanity and confronted by their worst fears. We have four to shoot, including a scene of Heather having to run naked across a hallway of broken glass while pursued by The Ceaseless, one of the Nameless' ""associates,"" who drags a corpse behind it that it uses as a bludgeoning tool. Another involves Heather being wheeled through a derelict hospital surrounded by souls upon whom involuntary surgeries are being performed by another of the Nameless' ""associates,"" The Heartless. Another involves Heather being confronted by a very macabre puppet show, where the corpses of her loved ones figure prominently.

But creating scenes like this won't be cheap for us. We are work quickly and we've made some great deals with Joshua Turi and the people at Design to Deceive, but to do these scenes properly, it will take more money than we can pay out of pocket. A typical day of shooting costs us $1,350 for our four person crew alone, and to do these effects, which we estimate will take place over several days of shooting, will require roughly $20,000. 

We want to be able to pay for props and prosthetics. Things like enough sugar glass to fill a hallway, prosthetic body parts, occasional studio rentals, latex injuries, gallons of fake blood all cost money. Sometimes, makeup is such a big job that an assistant needs to be hired. For the hospital set piece, we anticipate having to hire two assistants and devote Shannon and her assistant to the makeup of The Nameless, the Heartless, and their minions, while Leona and her assistant to makeup of Heather and the assembled suffering souls. Besides that, things like a proper gurney can cost around $520, not counting the additional fees required to make it look old and rusted.
Besides makeup, we want to be able pay cast and crew their regular rate. While Charles, as producer and director is not receiving any payment for his work on this until a distribution deal is made, camera, gaffer, sound, and PA all need to be paid. Actors are also paid for each day they work for us.  
We want to be able to be able to feed cast and crew. It is important that everybody be fed. In this age of Covid, extra precautions must also be taken to keep everyone safe. These can tack on additional fees. 

Practical effects are the key to making this film look the way we want it to look. It is very important to us that it not look cheesy or cheap and that parts that are supposed to terrify people do not cause them to laugh instead. As Indie filmmakers, we are used to doing a lot with a little and trust me, for some of the things we have in mind, $20,000 is very little.  If we don't get all of it, we'll still make things work to the best of our abilities, but cutting down some of our ideas may be very painful.
 
WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU?
Besides being able to see a kickass horror film when it is done, we are offering a number of perks to those of you generous enough to contribute to our campaign.

Those of you who contribute up to $10 will be able to know that you've made something of a difference in the lives of a scrappy family of indie filmmakers, intent on doing something awesome. While one $10 contribution won't set the world on fire, it is a start and you can feel good about yourself for making it.
For $20, we will put your name in a special thanks section of the credits, letting the world know you support indie horror.
For $35, not only will we put your name in the credits, we'll also send you a digital download of the film when we have finished the festival circuit. We estimate this to be around September 2022, but if it's later, you'll still receive it.
Those who contribute $50 will receive a physical edition of the film, in their choice of DVD or Blu-Ray, as well as thanks in the credits. As with the digital download, this will only come after the film is done with the festival circuit.
Those that contribute $75 will get that DVD or Blu-Ray signed by Charles  D. Lincoln, Chelsea LeSage, Emily McKinley Hill, and Anna Paulette. Possibly some bigger stars, but no promises... Of course, these contributors will be on the credits thanks list.
Now, at $100, things start to get interesting. Those that contribute at $100 will not only receive a signed DVD or Blu-Ray and a place in the credits, but they will be able to play, at a time and date of our choosing, an online session of the asymmetrical horror game Dead by Daylight, being hunted by The Nameless herself, Chelsea LeSage. You must own the game already but due to the game's crossplay nature, it will not matter if you own it on Playstation, Xbox, PC, or Switch. She will hunt you and three other contributors down in a session. 
If you'd like to have the tables turned, at $200, you will not only receive the signed DVD or Blu-Ray, the place in the credits, but you'll be able to play a session of Dead by Daylight where you will be the killer and director/writer Charles D. Lincoln, and cast members Chelsea LeSage, Emily McKinley Hill, and Anna Paulette will all be survivors. You will get one chance to stop us from running the generators and escaping. Can you be a better hunter than The Nameless?
If you're feeling a bit adventurous, you can contribute $500, where the bad news is we won't be putting you in that special thanks list anymore.  The good news is that you will now be listed as an Associate Producer with full IMDB credit. On top of that, if you are able to travel to New York City (and pass a rapid Covid test after the proper waiting period), we will make you one of the tortured souls in one of our hell sequences. You too can be mutilated and mangled by the Nameless as part of our film! On top of that, you will receive the signed DVD or Blu-Ray!
At $750, you'll receive the same perks as those who contribute $500, but you'll also be allowed to keep one of the props from your scene! What will it be? Well, obviously, we won't know until you're here. But you will be able to keep one that'll go with your shiny new Associate Producer Credit and signed DVD or Blu Ray.
Finally, those who contribute at $1,000 will get the big one, if you're looking to be on the other side of the camera. Executive Producer credit. Not only will you greatly help us towards getting this thing done, you'll also have something you can use when getting involved in your own projects. Of course, you'll also get the signed DVD and Blu-Ray. Hell, you've earned it, at that point.


 
Risks & Challenges
Independent film is not easy. It's putting out fire after fire, but we have a great cast and we have a reliable crew that are battle tested in dealing with the challenges that we are faced with. Our budget is very small, compared to some of the stuff you'd see coming out of Hollywood. We are passionate about what we're doing and we've had years of experience to help us get past any hurdles that may come in our way. Our only hurdle right now is funding.
If we don't receive it, we have to cut down on the effects, we have to cut down on the scale of some of our ideas, and the people who ultimately suffer are you, the independent horror fan who gets deprived of the experience we want to provide for you. We want to give you the same feelings we got when we saw Hellraiser or Martyrs for the first time. We want to bring you something where you'll care about the characters as much as you will be horrified by the ordeals they go through. We want to give you a vision of hell that mainstream cinema would find too disturbing to show you. We know what we're doing and we know how to do it. All we need it you to give us the means to do so. With so many of the cast and crew out of work during these past few months of Covid, being able to move ahead with funding and with drive will be exactly what we need and what we put together will be exactly what you need: an uncompromising piece of horror cinema, the likes of which you haven't seen in years! But we can only do it with your help! Won't you help keep independent horror alive?

<h3>The Film</h3>
<p>Set during the COVID-19 pandemic, <i>Wuhan Driver</i> is a narrative short film that offers a subtle yet unflinching glance at a night in the life of a Chinese man driving Uber in New York.</p>
<p>Our protagonist, <strong>Zhang</strong>, is all by himself but still powers through: he has no other choice. He crisscrosses the barren landscape of a city in lockdown, picking up various passengers, coming into contact with paranoia and prejudice, entangled in life during this era of anxiety.</p>
<p>This film aims to shed light on this reality in order to better understand the hardships that essential workers go through during the pandemic. Through this, we can have more compassion for those different from ourselves.</p>
<p>Here's a few words from our executive producer, Jonathan Sanger.</p>

<div>
<br/>This movie aims to touch upon this very issue, by telling a deeply human story. And with your help, we can hopefully shed a little more light on the darkness that seems to have enveloped all of us during this era.</div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Director's Statement</h3>
<p>In order to tell the most honest and relevant story, the film must be a realistic depiction of our current times. There is no rose-tinted window through which many filmmakers depict our world. It's not a film that tries to distract you through excessive violence and fast paced action sequences — it aims to tell us the truth, raw and unfiltered.</p>
<p>It’s about something very simple: a man and his everyday struggles. </p>
<p>I believe it's only through adopting the approach of Neorealist cinema —  telling it as it is, then allowing the audience the liberty to draw their own conclusions — that we can truly empathize with the experiences of a person totally different from ourselves. </p>
<p>Ultimately, I think making this short film will be, for me, a journey toward understanding each other better: a journey we're all taking.<br/> </p>
<h3>Our Budget</h3>
</div><div><div>

</div></div></div>","The Film
Set during the COVID-19 pandemic, Wuhan Driver is a narrative short film that offers a subtle yet unflinching glance at a night in the life of a Chinese man driving Uber in New York.
Our protagonist, Zhang, is all by himself but still powers through: he has no other choice. He crisscrosses the barren landscape of a city in lockdown, picking up various passengers, coming into contact with paranoia and prejudice, entangled in life during this era of anxiety.
This film aims to shed light on this reality in order to better understand the hardships that essential workers go through during the pandemic. Through this, we can have more compassion for those different from ourselves.
Here's a few words from our executive producer, Jonathan Sanger.

 
Our Team
Tiger JiWriter / Director

At age sixteen he wrote, directed, and co-produced his first feature film, Pluto, which went on to screen at over 30 film festivals worldwide and won 18 awards and nominations. Tiger has studied under acclaimed filmmaker Lucrecia Martel, worked for trailblazer theatre director Elizabeth LeCompte. This film will be his most technically elaborate and ambitious to date.

Jonathan SangerExecutive Producer

What's In It For You?
Aside from the perks and rewards that come from your support, you will be a part of telling an important and relevant story.
During this era, we all find ourselves stuck inside our homes in avoiding a fatal virus. But what about those who don't have the afforded privilege to work from home? What about those people have no choice but to venture outside and risk everything?
As said by this particular Chinese Uber driver: ""You risk your life to make money, but you might not live to spend it.""


This movie aims to touch upon this very issue, by telling a deeply human story. And with your help, we can hopefully shed a little more light on the darkness that seems to have enveloped all of us during this era.
 
Director's Statement
In order to tell the most honest and relevant story, the film must be a realistic depiction of our current times. There is no rose-tinted window through which many filmmakers depict our world. It's not a film that tries to distract you through excessive violence and fast paced action sequences — it aims to tell us the truth, raw and unfiltered.
It’s about something very simple: a man and his everyday struggles. 
I believe it's only through adopting the approach of Neorealist cinema —  telling it as it is, then allowing the audience the liberty to draw their own conclusions — that we can truly empathize with the experiences of a person totally different from ourselves. 
Ultimately, I think making this short film will be, for me, a journey toward understanding each other better: a journey we're all taking. 
Our Budget

Your funds will become a portion of our total production budget.
Our team has a very precise vision for Wuhan Driver that includes many expensive elements that are integral to the story. We're therefore asking for your support!
On top of normal productions expenses for a street shoot in New York City, extra precautions will be taken to ensure the safety of our cast and crew during the pandemic. This means that extra funding will be needed to orchestrate every moving part of our production.
Here is a breakdown of our production expenses, and where your money will go:

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>About Us</strong></p>
<p>My name is Reece Lipman and I am a writer, director and filmmaker. Along with my producers Max Marlow and Niccolò Cioni, I have been working for 2 years to get our short film <i><strong><u>Ice Cream and Doughnuts</u></strong></i> made. The film stars <i><strong><a href=""https://www.curtisbrown.co.uk/client/jamael-westman"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jamael Westman</a> </strong></i>(<i>Hamilton</i> - West End) and <strong><i><a href=""https://www.curtisbrown.co.uk/client/anita-joy-uwajeh"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Anita Joy Uwajeh</a> </i></strong>(<i>Cyrano De Bergerac</i> - West End). With the film shot, we are now at the final hurdle and just need your help to get us over the line!</p>
<p>The money raised from this campaign will go towards post production costs and future festival entries, as well as re-paying some of our production costs. <i><u>We will also be donating 20% of the funding we receive to the <a href=""https://theatreartists.fund/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Theatre Arts Fund</a></u></i>, providing short-term relief for hundreds of theatre workers and freelancers across the UK, and particularly those from underrepresented groups disproportionately affected by the Coronavirus crisis.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Plot</strong></p>
<p>It’s a sunny afternoon in a small British coastal town and Robbie (29) and Emily (27) are at the apex of that magical first 6 months of a relationship where every moment is an adventure and they know they’re on the cusp of something special. But as talk turns to the future and the excitement of planning what comes next, the first cracks start to appear. For Robbie the future means building a life and a family with Emily. But Emily dreams of leaving that town and of ‘being more’. She has struggled, fighting tragedy and society’s expectations with the goal of one day achieving everything she wants to in life, and she is determined to get there. </p>
<p>Life is more fun when they’re together, they know that for a fact. But are these dreams ultimately compatible. Is being in love enough to hold a relationship together?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Cast</strong></p>
<p><i><u><a href=""https://www.curtisbrown.co.uk/client/jamael-westman"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jamael Westman</a> - Robbie</u></i></p>
<p>Jamael is best known for playing Alexander Hamilton in Lin-Manuel Miranda's multi-award winning show ‘Hamilton’ in its original West End cast. He was nominated for Best Actor at the 2018 Olivier Awards for this role. He is due to appear as Hamilton again at The Pantages Theatre in LA.</p> <p><u><i><a href=""https://www.curtisbrown.co.uk/client/anita-joy-uwajeh"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Anita Joy Uwajeh</a> - Emily</i></u></p>
<p>Anita is an incredibly experienced theatre actor, having appeared in multiple West End productions, including most recently ‘Cyrano De Bergerac’, alongside James McAvoy and ‘King Lear’ alongside Sir Ian McKellen. An incredible talent, Anita-Joy is set for big things in the future.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Where are we / Project History</strong></p>
<p>Principal Photography for Ice Cream and Doughnuts took place in Worthing over the weekend of 18-20th September 2020. With a cast and crew of 15 people, and against the backdrop of COVID-19 we undertook probably one of the most logistically challenging shoots any of us have been a part of. </p>
<p>A completely united crew, we were excited and happy to be able to get back to work again after a particularly difficult year for us all. And what we came back with was some beautiful shots and the makings of a very special film.</p>
<p>We are now entering the post production phase as our baby finally nears completion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603195274/zithi6ei405eouawegni.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Due to COVID-19 the funding that we had been hoping to receive prior to filming fell through. This left us in a daunting position but it felt wrong to let the incredible cast and crew we had assembled go at a time when there was no other work going. So we decided to push on and try to create something beautiful in a year that has been anything but. </p>
<p>And so now, with the shoot all complete and with just post ahead of us we need that final push across the line. As well as raising some funds to hopefully cover some of the production outlays, the funding we are looking for will be put towards editing, grading, post-production sound and, ultimately, advertising and festival applications. </p>
<p>In return, aside from the warm fuzzy feeling of helping us to create this film, we are offering a number of excellent perks including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exclusive Thank You Video from those involved in making the film.</li>
<li>Exclusive download of the original song ""Ice Cream and Doughnuts"" performed live by Jamael Westman in the film.</li>
<li>Private viewing link of the film (available to watch online for a limited time when completed)</li>
<li>A digital copy of the script with further detailed information and directors notes from Writer/Director Reece Lipman</li>
<li>Executive Producer credits.</li>
<li>And more!</li>
</ul> <p><strong>Help Us, Help Others</strong></p>
<p>So many people across film, theatre, music and the creative arts have struggled this year due to lockdowns, lack of government help and the lack of any work. This industry is more than a job for most of us. It’s how we put food on the table, but also how we breath, how we live and how we interact with the world around us.</p>
<p>So, from whatever you donate to help us complete and distribute our film, 20% will be donated to the <a href=""https://theatreartists.fund/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Theatre Artist’s Fund</a> which has been set up to provide emergency support for theatre workers and freelancers across the UK. Their ambition for the fund is to provide short-term relief for hundreds of theatre workers and freelancers across the UK, and particularly those from underrepresented groups disproportionately affected by the crisis. </p> <p><strong>How the Money will be Spent</strong></p>
<p>Contributions will go towards -</p>
<p><u><i>Re-Paying Production costs</i></u></p>
<ul>
<li>Kit hire - camera, lenses, grip</li>
<li>Location Costs</li>
<li>Crew costs - food, travel &amp; wages</li>
<li>Hard drives for file storage and editing</li>
<li>COVID safety costs (including PPE)</li>

<p><u><i>Post-Production</i></u></p>
<ul>
<li>Editing</li>
<li>Colour Grading</li>
<li>Music and Sound Design</li>
<li>Creating files for festival distribution</li>
</ul>
<p><i><u>Festival Submission</u></i></p>
<ul><li>Most festivals can cost up to £60 to enter (with no guarantee your film will be chosen) so the costs can rack up fast.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With the film already shot, we have made it through the hardest and most expensive part of production and so we expect the risks of completing it to be minimal.

<p>The biggest risk is that we fail to get into film festivals. This is always an unknown when producing a film, but if that route does fail we always have other options for distribution.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Pleasure to meet you.  We are the founders of The Secret Cup, Daniel de Sailles and Jeremy Norrie.  In a time when it was still mostly illegal, The Secret Cup was the only cannabis competition that decided an international champion of making concentrate commonly known as hash. We traveled the world going to different places and learning about the local cultures of cannabis. It was about showcasing the finest authentic achievements, forming a family and living an incredible adventure all while avoiding the long arm of the law.</p>
<p>During that time we filmed at many of the events and this began Jeremy's journey to become a Director/Producer of many documentary films.  Now  we finally have completed the documentary film about The Secret Cup that will be getting released soon to Amazon, FOX and CBS streaming platforms among others.</p>
<p>This campaign is for raising money to do advertising, marketing and promotion for the film.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise at least $5K to fund various marketing and advertising programs such as The Arsonist and October Sky as well as fund the fees to enter film festivals around the world.  This will help the film get the most exposure as possible at the start of the digital release and will help to generate more views and support from the platforms it is on.</p>
<p>As such we have created a few limited edition and one of a kind items that our supporters will be familiar with, especially if they have already been collecting merchandise from the events.  Some of our items have sold for hundreds of dollars to collectors since the end of the competitions.  Please help us by purchasing one or more of our items we have made available. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There are various companies that specialize in marketing independent films and documentaries.  We have used a few of them in the past but never all of them for one project, and the largest companies we have been saving up to work with.</p>
<p>This film has a huge amount of underground support because of the events authentic story and the family it formed all around the world.  We think with our combined efforts that this film can become one of the most popular films about the culture of cannabis ever to have been made. </p>
<h3>Risks</h3>
<p>Normally we fund these campaigns entirely ourselves but for this effort we plan to match whatever is raised and really put together a professional marketing strategy for the film.</p>

<p>Inspired by the films of David Lynch, this is a strange and symbolic tale of the horrors of family  inheritance, set amidst the backdrop of rural Montana. As a group of seniors at Montana State University, This Be The Verse is our senior thesis project. This film represents the culmination of our skills as filmmakers and will give us the opportunity to share our skills with future employers. But, since we’re still students, we need a little financial assistance to get us off the ground!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Budget Breakdown</h3>
<p><u><i>TOTAL BUDGET - $5000</i></u></p>
<p>EQUIPMENT - $2000</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">While MSU provides a large variety of equipment for students to use, we still need to rent specific lenses to pair with the Arri Alexa. Arri Master Prime lenses will provide the particular look that defines This Be The Verse. The lens rental is the most expensive aspect of our budget, but also one of the most important, because it will define how the film looks. </p>
<p> LOCATION FEES - $500</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">This Be The Verse takes place in a ramshackle house. Since the Bozeman marketplace is booming out of control, a necessary part of our budget must cover a small deposit we pay to the location of our film. Paying this deposit ensures that we will be able to use the location while giving the owners an assurance that we will take good care of their home. </p>
<p>PROPS - $500</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Production design is an essential component of any film because props help create the world of the film. By finding or creating specific props for each character, the world of the film slowly comes to life. </p>
<p>HAIR &amp; MAKEUP - $350</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Because this is a horror film, grotesque makeup is key. Our makeup artist - Jack Hueser - has been hard at work creating a grotesque look specifically for this film. But, he’s in need of additional supplies. Making sure Jack has all of the necessary makeup will ensure that the horror element of the film comes through. </p>
<p>FOOD - $850</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Food is essential to keep our cast and crew working at their peak potential. Because of COVID-19 regulations, serving snacks and meals on set has become more complicated. All of our snacks and meals must be individually packaged, which adds on an additional cost. </p>
<p>COSTUMES - $200</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Costumes are a smaller but important section of this film. By utilizing thrift stores and creating costumes from scratch, our crew is working to limit the expense of outfitting the cast. </p>
<p>COVID SUPPLIES - $200</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">With COVID still prevalent in society, our crew will take all the necessary precautions to ensure that no one on our set gets sick. By providing the necessary PPE, consistent sanitization, and temperature checks, our crew will make safety our top priority. </p>

<h3>Perks &amp; Rewards</h3>
<p>In exchange for your financial support, we’ve created a list of unique perks that will give you a glimpse behind the scenes of This Be The Verse. We’re offering up exclusive Behind the Scenes videos, custom stickers or posters, signed photos of the cast &amp; crew, early access to the finished film, and even an Executive Producer credit. </p>
<h3>Director’s Statement</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>""As many people can attest, the Covid-19 pandemic had me spending a lot of time with my family, and had me in a state of serious introspection. One question that continually racked my brain was the role that my own family inheritance had played in my life. In terms of both good and bad, I found myself pondering how my inherited traits and the values instilled in me were affecting my own personal growth. This script was written while isolated in quarantine and with that introspective question in mind. Through This be the Verse, I hope that viewers can attain catharsis in their own introspective exploration of inheritance, and hopefully can assist them in answering a very important question: ‘how much of myself can I truly change?’ "" - Noah Hense (Writer &amp; Director)</i></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>COVID - 19: This Be The Verse was inspired by the hard times that COVID-19 caused, but the creation of the film is still impacted by the effect of COVID-19. Although all of the cast &amp; crew members are fully vaccinated, the Delta variant has caused MSU to keep the COVID protocols in place. These include temperature taking, consistent sanitation, social distancing, individually packaged food, and masks. While these safety measures are important, the small needs add up into large costs. </p>
<p>Makeup: One of our biggest concerns is that the grotesque makeup will not work effectively. To mitigate that concern, our makeup artist (Jack Hueser) and director (Noah Hense) have been practicing different techniques all summer. By the time production rolls around, we know they’ll be prepared!</p>
<h3>Other ways you can help:</h3>
<p>Even if you can’t contribute monetarily, please spread the word about our film! We’d love it if you shared our Indiegogo page, our website, or tag us on social media. We’re incredibly excited about creating This Be The Verse but we can’t do it without your help!</p>

<p>Who is Moon Knight? How did Marc Spector become the Knight of Vengeance for Khonshu, Egyptian god of the moon? This is the main story that Origins explores. Jumping between modern day and the past, the story explores the brutal vigilante that Moon Knight is now and how Marc Spector became Moon Knight after Raul Bushman left him for dead in the desert. </p>
<p>In this particular story, we are getting an opportunity to explore 3 of the character's personalities including Marc Spector (the mercenary before Moon Knight), Jake Lockley (the ride share driver/ear on the street), and the vigilante Moon Knight. Although focused on Marc Spector's backstory, there is also a strong focus on action.</p>

<p>We are a group of incredibly passionate filmmakers and Moon Knight fans determined to bring this story to life while also doing it justice on a shoe string budget. The last thing we want is to do disservice to who this character is and what the heart of these comics are. Everyone involved in this project works in the film industry in some capacity and have been working hard for the past few months on bringing this project to life.</p>

<p>We're very excited to be bringing Moon Knight to life in Origins. However, one thing we haven't had as much opportunity to explore is his psychosis with his multiple personalities. So we have some stretch goals that if we can reach will allow us to explore that aspect of Moon Knight as well as the character of Midnight Man. And we make our stretch goals for the next fan film, all VARIOUS PRODUCER CREDITS will be honored for both fan films.</p>
<p>Check out our stretch goals below!</p>
<p><strong>$10,000</strong> - We'll be able to create larger and more dynamic action sequences for Origins and a couple of expanded scenes with Jake Lockley and Steven Grant.</p>
<p><strong>$15,000</strong> – We can make a PROOF OF CONCEPT for a fan film with Morpheus as the antagonist and exploring more of Moon Knight's psychosis.</p>
<p><strong>$20,000</strong> – We can make the Morpheus focused Moon Knight fan film on a smaller scale.</p>
<p><strong>$30,000</strong> – We’ll have everything we need to properly bring the second Morpheus fan film to life, including delivering larger and more dynamic action sequences. After the goal is reached, anything after the $10,000 mark will go into making the second fan film with Morpheus, focused more on Moon Knight's psychosis.</p>

<p>Our initial budget has been allocated for being able to pay for food &amp; gas on set days, extra props, costumes, and any rentals, as well as being able to pay cast, crew, and post production crew. This will all allow us to be more flexible, have more personnel to not be stretched too thin on set, and make sure those working on the project can put food on their table! This film is not impossible without a higher budget but what we'll be able to pull off will be even more amazing if we can put more funds into it.</p>

</div></div>","Who is Moon Knight? How did Marc Spector become the Knight of Vengeance for Khonshu, Egyptian god of the moon? This is the main story that Origins explores. Jumping between modern day and the past, the story explores the brutal vigilante that Moon Knight is now and how Marc Spector became Moon Knight after Raul Bushman left him for dead in the desert. 
In this particular story, we are getting an opportunity to explore 3 of the character's personalities including Marc Spector (the mercenary before Moon Knight), Jake Lockley (the ride share driver/ear on the street), and the vigilante Moon Knight. Although focused on Marc Spector's backstory, there is also a strong focus on action.
Official Social Media:

We are a group of incredibly passionate filmmakers and Moon Knight fans determined to bring this story to life while also doing it justice on a shoe string budget. The last thing we want is to do disservice to who this character is and what the heart of these comics are. Everyone involved in this project works in the film industry in some capacity and have been working hard for the past few months on bringing this project to life.
No matter what happens, we're determined to find a way to finish this project (before the new Disney show is released) and with your help we can build an even better fan film for all of you to enjoy! We're shooting the entire project on the Blackmagic Pocket 4k Cinema Camera and are bringing all of our expertise to make this as good as possible.

<h3>Year of the Woman? </h3>
<p>Who cares about a Black  single mother running for local city council? Why should it matter that a Queer Black woman is running for the Denver Transit Board?  Why should people pay attention to a Latinx woman born in one of the most polluted neighborhoods in the United States who is running for office? </p>
<p>These are not just their stories, they are our stories.  Stories that have been left out of the conversation around feminism and leadership and politics.  </p>
<p>In 1992 American voters elected more new women to Congress than any previous decade.  This started what some thought would be ""The Year of the Woman"" and although there were gains made, all one has to do is turn on the news to recognize that we still have far to go and that there are still too many races women must run  and too many battles we must fight before our work is done.</p>
<p>I want to capture these battles. I want to share stories that are infrequently told (if they are told at all).  I want to show the world that big things can happen in small cities. I want to  document women of color running for office in a city that has aptly been called ""Wakanda for White People"". </p>
<h3><strong>Who Cares About Local Elections? </strong></h3>
<p>Voter turn out is typically lower during mid-term elections. A stunning number of people don't vote in their municipal and local elections at all.  WThe saying,  ""All Politics is Local"" is attributed to Tip O'Neill; Yes, our national elections are incredibly important but equally important are the local elections that shape our day to day life and impact our livelihood, our families and our communities.</p>
<p>Women of color are consistently left out of these narratives. </p>
<p><i>Running with My Girls</i> will have a local focus in Denver, which is a primarily white city.  However, the themes will be universal; representation, struggle, dismantling racism and uplifting the voices of women of color in politics.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Professional videographers and editors are very expensive. On average it costs about $1,500 per day for an 8 hour shoot. As we will be following multiple subjects we will need at least two camera operators per shoot. Plus expenses and  editing which typically runs about $85.00 per hour. $25,000 will get us started on the project.</p>
<p>As a full time working mother I know this is an ambitious ""side"" project but as evidenced by my previous films, I can make it happen, especially with my incredible passion for supporting ""my girls"" and raising up the voices and profiles of women of color. </p>
<p> If we don't reach our initial 25K goal we will still be able to start filming with the funds we raise and produce content which will generate more interest  and in turn more funding. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project will be multifaceted. We will be highlighting the courage and strength of women as well as the importance of voting and being an active and engaged member of your community. This film will show women of all ages and backgrounds what is possible, even against incredible odds. It will explore the barriers that have traditionally kept women out of political office and will inform and excite viewers to be more active and involved. It will be a film that women will reference when they are writing their memoirs and being interviewed about what was the spark that made them run for office and how their careers in politics began and flourished in spite of the deck being stacked against them. </p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
</div><div>
<p>Any documentary project runs a risk of not being completed however,  this project will be completed after the elections in May 2019.  I am hopeful that all of the women that are running win. Regardless of the outcomes; sharing these stories will be illuminating and will help pave the way for a future that is female, truly diverse and inclusive. </p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>

</div></div>","Year of the Woman? 
Who cares about a Black  single mother running for local city council? Why should it matter that a Queer Black woman is running for the Denver Transit Board?  Why should people pay attention to a Latinx woman born in one of the most polluted neighborhoods in the United States who is running for office? 
These are not just their stories, they are our stories.  Stories that have been left out of the conversation around feminism and leadership and politics.  
In 1992 American voters elected more new women to Congress than any previous decade.  This started what some thought would be ""The Year of the Woman"" and although there were gains made, all one has to do is turn on the news to recognize that we still have far to go and that there are still too many races women must run  and too many battles we must fight before our work is done.

We're here to complete the production funding needed in order to make your nightmares come true!Yes, we're back! After raising just over 75% of our projected budget with our first campaign, our production was halted due to the year long Covid-19 Lockdown in both United States and Canada. Instead of forcing the production to work in a dangerous environment, or incur the additional costs of Covid-safe productions, we instead decided to put the project on hold until restrictions were lifted. Now that restrictions are finally loosening and our cast and crew can return to set safely, we are ready to get back to work! We are currently preparing our schedule for a fall production date, which will ultimately depend on when the Canada/U.S. border travel restrictions are finally lifted. We have heard that it may be as soon as July and will keep backers informed as the situation progresses.Meanwhile while we pick back up with pre-production, we are also utilizing this time to launch a new campaign as an attempt to close the gap on the remaining 25% of our budget and more!Not only will this campaign give fans new and old a second opportunity to join our team, but raising the remainder of our original budget (or more!) will be vital for our visual effects and post-production costs. Dylan's New Nightmare acts as an unofficial sequel to Wes Craven's New Nightmare, one of the most unique and high concept installments to the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. This short film picks up 25 years after the events of New Nightmare and follows our lead Dylan Porter (Miko Hughes), the young son of Heather Langenkamp, now a grown man trying to make his way in the world his parents raised him in—Hollywood. Little does he know that the evil entity known as Freddy Krueger is back, and eager to once again break into our world through the son of his favorite victim!This project was conceived by Cecil Laird, who has loved the horror genre ever since he was a child. Freddy Krueger has always been his favorite slasher, so when he was deciding what The Horror Show's next huge project should be, a sequel to Wes Craven's New Nightmare clawed its way into his head and just wouldn't leave! So the project began.Luckily, to ensure that this fan film is of the highest quality, we have enlisted the incredible help of Producer, Vincente DiSanti, the creative force behind Womp Stomp Films and the widely successful Friday the 13th fan film and its prequel, Never Hike Alone and Never Hike in the Snow.  We've also brought in Rene Rivas, the man behind that excellent Halloween fan film The Spirit of Haddonfield,  as both Producer and Director of Photography.  Additionally, we are lucky enough to have Nora Hewitt, the winner of season 9 of FaceOff, to head up our Special Make-Up Department and be FX Supervisor for the film!But even as cool as this whole project is up to this point, it would be nothing without the involvement of MIKO HUGHES himself, who will be reprising his role as Dylan Porter, the son of Heather Langenkamp from the original Wes Craven's New Nightmare! That's right! Miko is back!So obviously, with all of these talented individuals, plus original costuming and props being designed for the flick by people very close to the franchise, this project is sure to be a film that belongs on every horror fan's shelf, right next to the rest of their Nightmare collection!Being that the short film is not-for-profit, our goal is really just to put out a film that not only makes the fans and creators of the Nightmare on Elm Street series proud.

As stated, we have already raised 75% of our budget in the first campaign, so we are looking to raise the remaining 25% in this campaign!

A jack of all trades, Vincente is best known for his directorial work on Never Hike in the Snow (2020), Disappear (2019), Never Hike Alone (2017), Imagine (2018), The Red Room (2015), and starring as Michael Myers in The Spirit of Haddonfield (2018).                                                         Rene Rivas has been a film aficionado for as far back as he can remember. Building his Arizona based production company since 2015, Rene Rivas Productions LLC, Rene has completed the feature noir Northern, 2018's short Halloween fan film The Spirit of Haddonfield, and more recently the upcoming horror short, Judy, and the recently released The TENT. Writing and Directing are Rene‘s main focus, but his skills range from cinematography, to producing, to editing & sound design--the whole gambit.David has been Cecil’s film partner for his whole career. He has done every project a person can do on set, having worked on numerous independent horror films featuring actors like Kane Hodder and Tiffany Shepis! He may be camera-shy, but there’s no stronger all-around force behind the scenes of a film set than this man. While he can do any job behind the camera, having him in place as Assistant Director will ensure his skills are utilized to the fullest on the set of Dylan’s New Nightmare!For as long as she can remember, Nora Hewitt has had a love of the movies with horror resonating more than any other genre. This passion and a life-long knack for artistic flair caused her to follower her passions at Tom Savini's Special Makeup Effects Program, from which she graduated in January of 2015. She then went on to not only join the cast of the ninth season of Syfy’s long-running Makeup FX show Face/Off, but she actually won the entire thing! Currently, she is happily pursuing her dreams freelancing in the special effects makeup industry.The Whole Gang:We would like to state that The Horror Show, Cecil Laird Productions, Womp Stomp Films & Rene Rivas Productions formally acknowledge that Dylan’s New Nightmare is a not-for-profit fan film and in no way associated or affiliated with New Line Cinema, Warner Bros Pictures or any other company that owns the rights to the character of Freddy Krueger and/or A Nightmare on Elm Street.The budget for this campaign is being raised to help cover the unavoidable expenses that come with making any production. Every dollar we receive from our campaigns is spent directly on the film along with the production, packaging, and shipping of the campaign perks.Ultimately, we are partnering with fans to bring Freddy back in a very cool way that returns him to a much-beloved continuity! Any funds left un-spent on the production will be donated to the National Audubon Society. For those that don't know, Wes Craven had a massive love of birds and even served on the Board of Directors for the California Chapter of the organization, so any excess funds will be donated to this cause in his memory.Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help! Here are a few things you can do to still assist the production:Share this page and help spread the word that FREDDY IS COMING BACK!Join, follow and share the Dylan's New Nightmare Facebook, Twitter & Instagram pages for updates and discussion with the filmmakers.Subscribe to The Horror Show Channel on YouTube for regular video updates as the production moves along.Thank you for visiting the page! If you are so inclined, choose a perk and help us bring this vision to life to help celebrate the 25th anniversary of the original Wes Craven’s New Nightmare! The whole idea is to pay tribute to the people that created the original series we all love so much, and especially the late, great Wes Craven, without whom horror wouldn’t be what it is today.If you have any other questions, please email us at TheHorrorShow666@yahoo.com, or message us on our Facebook, Twitter or Instagram pages!THANK YOU!",31.0,1,"2 Campaigns

It wasn’t malicious; it wasn't a government conspiracy; we just got some things wrong. 'Eating fat makes you fat' seemed logical.

I’ve put this research into practice, and now, at age 35, I’m in the best shape of my life. My vitals and blood work are flawless and I haven’t been sick in 3 years.

The production was conceived as a 100% outdoor shoot due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “1805” aims, in its own small way, to explore the continuum of an oppressive system that disfigures the morality of the oppressed by pitting them against each other. This is not a film about a hero beating the odds, this is a film about the odds preventing a hero’s rise in the first place. Ultimately, “1805” is a story for the thousands of others like it, forever lost to history.Who's in it?Nathaniel J. Ryan as Basammer - IMDB/WebsiteBasammer, a  slave recently purchased by Mr. Jared Corey, escapes a Virginia plantation with his secret wife, Marfay. Basammer is principled yet naive.

She is compassionate yet pragmatic. She loves Basammer, and will do anything to ensure they make it across the Mason-Dixon line. Ross Denyer as Mr. Jared Corey - IMDBThe scion of a slave owning Virginia family, Jared Corey struggles to maintain a grasp on the power he recently inherited. Frank Sean Johnson as Joshua - IMDBAn older freedman who risks his life crossing back over the Mason-Dixon line to broker a deal.

With a string of festivals set to screen “Down the River” on the West Coast, Dan decided to move back to the states in March 2020, after 12 years living in Israel.Then COVID hit.One after another, the festivals moved online.

A longtime collaborator with Dan Jacobson, Raz shot “Down the River”. Raz spent weeks quarantining on both ends of his first trip to America, committing more than six weeks to the project.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Hi folks, my name is Oscar De Leon, writer-director of the visual album adaptation of “Trip 27” by rapper/producer Huck. You might know me better by my artist moniker, guero. Huck and I have been collaborating on music videos for almost 2 years now and it’s been the collaboration of a lifetime. For our next collaboration, we are swinging for the fences and attempting a <strong>5-part music video-short film hybrid </strong>that will take us cross country on a road trip. </p>
<p>When we first met, we bonded over cinematic videos as a form of visual expression. We both knew that we could create something great when we combined our talents. After having worked on 4 music videos so far, we’ve decided to push even further and create a piece of visual art that will be shared for years to come. </p>
<p>Your help will enable us to realize our dream. For this project, we are planning on filming music videos along a road trip to create something visually dazzling while also telling a concise story. Not only will your contributions help create the project, but they will also allow us to help pay the team of talented filmmakers committed to making this project a reality. </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p> <p>With over half our budget already raised, we need help covering operational costs for the trip. Your contributions will help us secure proper lodging, food, and, god forbid, extra padding for any worst-case scenario on the long and winding road. </p> <p>Your contribution makes you part of the team! You will get you a thank you in the credits alongside some cool goodies like pins, t-shirts, and posters.

Hi folks, my name is Oscar De Leon, writer-director of the visual album adaptation of “Trip 27” by rapper/producer Huck. You might know me better by my artist moniker, guero. Huck and I have been collaborating on music videos for almost 2 years now and it’s been the collaboration of a lifetime. For our next collaboration, we are swinging for the fences and attempting a 5-part music video-short film hybrid that will take us cross country on a road trip. 
When we first met, we bonded over cinematic videos as a form of visual expression. We both knew that we could create something great when we combined our talents. After having worked on 4 music videos so far, we’ve decided to push even further and create a piece of visual art that will be shared for years to come. 
Your help will enable us to realize our dream. For this project, we are planning on filming music videos along a road trip to create something visually dazzling while also telling a concise story. Not only will your contributions help create the project, but they will also allow us to help pay the team of talented filmmakers committed to making this project a reality. 
What We Need & What You Get With over half our budget already raised, we need help covering operational costs for the trip. Your contributions will help us secure proper lodging, food, and, god forbid, extra padding for any worst-case scenario on the long and winding road.  Your contribution makes you part of the team! You will get you a thank you in the credits alongside some cool goodies like pins, t-shirts, and posters. You’ll also get updates on the filmmaking process and unprecedented access to the talents behind the camera with behind the scene footage and more!Any funds raised here will go directly into the project.

<h3>Hello Indie Horror Friends and Fans!</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1595819168/q2nzfgcve7wwca5c5nmd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>My name is Justin M. Seaman and I am the Co- Producer along with Zane Hershberger. We are the team that brought you the retro throwback horror film 'The Barn' and currently in production 'The Barn Part II'. Also just recently completed is 'Force to Fear' an 80s' action flick in the vein of 'Savage Streets' meets 'The Collector'. We have been working together since 2013 on various other projects with other films including '10/31', '10/31 Part 2' and 'Volumes of Blood: Horror Stories'.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596596868/l0jts9o2aoesbipfobl1.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What is 'CRYPTIDS'?</strong></h2>
<p>'Cryptids' is a creature feature horror anthology that takes place in a radio station on a show called ""The Truth Serum"" hosted by Major Harlan Dean. On tonight's episode Harlan decides to tackle the topic of cryptozoology but as the phone lines light up and the calls come in, each caller's stories become increasingly more bizarre and Harlan starts to question if real dangers are lurking outside the station.</p>
<p>The film is meant to bring back our favorite days of films and television shows like Creepshow, Monsters, Tales from the Darkside and Tales from the Crypt. Using as much practical FX with the monsters as we can and keeping the CGI to a minimum. You can expect to see such legends as Bigfoot, Loveland Frogman, Chupacubras, Beast of Bladenboro, Dover Demon and more!</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Origins</strong></h2>
<p>The idea of Cryptids began because Zane bought a book as a child at a school book fair called ""Monsters You Never Heard Of"" by Daniel Coen and it sparked a love of monster stories ever since. Growing up listening to Art Bell's Coast to Coast he thought it seemed like a no brainer to tell a story about callers who call in to a radio show with their monster encounters and thus 'Cryptids' was born. In 2013, Zane started the project but his original team jumped ship after he shot his segment ""Melon Heads"". After becoming friends with Zane on the set of 'The Barn' in 2016 I decided I would help him resurrect his project and help him take it to the finish line, we just didn't realize it would be such a long line haha.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1595487533/a5nkoerpzacbfit6iybu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Staying true to Zane's vision, we met and brought on board various indie filmmakers to direct segments in the film including: Brett DeJager of 'Bonejangles', Max Groah of 'Bong of the Living Dead', Johnny William Holt of 'The Dooms Chapel Horror' and Billy Pon of 'Circus of the Dead' plus our long time FX artist Robert Kuhn.</p>
<p>We still had 2 main segments left to film plus the wraparound radio show called ""The Truth Serum with Major Harlan Dean"". We spent about 2 years looking for the perfect person to play Harlan Dean and luckily while working the convention circuit I met just the person I was looking for while in Lexington Kentucky at Scarefest 2018. After quite some time working out the details I was finally able to land Mr. Monster Vision/ The Last Drive-In himself...Joe Bob Briggs! <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1595487654/gekabhhgnwn1rknh5ddd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I'm not gonna lie, a big chunk of the funding was for this scene and we needed it before we could shoot so we had everything ready to film for April 2020. The campaign was ready to launch first week of March and then the pandemic hit. We just couldn't in good conscious make the campaign live, so we decided to postpone the shoot and wait. In fact if you have a copy of the May issue of SCREAM magazine you'll see our ad in there that we prepaid to coincide with the ending of our original campaign.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596597014/yhuoysmkd907wt0j2enw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Then we rescheduled our shoot for July 2020, we took what savings we had left and we built the sets, hired the actors, booked the flights, accommodations etc and we shot the segment. Joe Bob nailed it!<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1595488038/tvis430vgf6revwrnmfw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>The campaign means a lot to us because we need your help to finish this film, we've been self funding this project since 2013 and now with the additional blow of the pandemic we don't have the capital to complete the remainder of the film anytime soon.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>How much are you raising and why?</strong> We are looking to raise $23,000.00 - Why that much? Well because we still have 2 more segments to shoot and we've spent roughly 70% of that overall over the years so far and we still have to spend a minimum of another $10k to complete the film and cover the manufacturing of the perks as well as the shipping/fees for Indiegogo. We know that the total amount we are asking will not cover the cost of the overall film nor the additional expenses that are sure to arise in the future but this will at least get us to a place were the film can be completed.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Can we see the film before the Indiegogo perks are shipped?</strong> It's still undecided if the film will be submitted into film fests or not due to the pandemic, it is something we will decide once the film is completed and we see how the world is at that time. We would love to enter the film into film fests if possible so we may have the opportunity to reconnect with our filmmakers, friends and fans in person one day again. Otherwise we have discussed at minimum a tour of the film even if its only at drive-in theaters or smaller theaters to help with additional funds before the physical release.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>What do you get in return for supporting us</strong>? Well all kinds of great perks from posters to T-shirts, DVDs, Blurays that are signed from the directors and even Joe Bob Briggs himself!</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul></ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges and FAQ</h3>
<ul><li>
<b>What is the biggest challenge?</b>  Our biggest challenge outside of not having the remaining funds to complete the film at the moment is COVID-19 limiting when we can film and when our segment directors can film safely. We will continue to work on the project as long as everyone involved feels comfortable and safe on set.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>What if you don't reach your goal?</strong> This isn't an ALL or NOTHING campaign so if we don't reach our total we will receive what we raise minus larger platform fees. However, if we don't reach our goal the film will still get made, it will just take even longer to finish.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>What about stretch goals?</strong> We'll discuss those if we get close to the goal haha</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>If you have self funded it this far, why not just continue it by yourself?</strong>  The goal was to always start out self funding and then continue and finish with crowdfunding, but the project became so on going that we never had a chance to do the crowdfunding portion. Normally we make most of our funds going to conventions and selling our other films but this year has killed that for us and we have no idea what next year will bring so we are truly hoping that this campaign can help us complete this project while allowing all of you to finally be a part of something we have been working on behind the scenes secretly for a very long time.</li></ul>

<h3>It Lives!!!</h3>
<p>We're just a bunch of horror nerds trying to live out our dream by entertaining an audience making horror films.  </p>
<p>The impetus of this project was simple ... I saw that director Sebastien Godin was out there doing it. Making micro-budget film after film: Slimoids, Ouija Mummy, Blood Rites of the Vampyre etc.  I admired his tenacious filmmaking as well as his passion for the horror genre.  I was making documentaries, feature length and shorts, as well as producing a couple of short horror projects but the end goal was always feature length horror films.  </p>
<p>Seb invited me up to North Bay to do some work on his latest film, The Abominations of Frankenstein ... I agreed.  Then I had an idea.  What if I produced Seb's next film?  What if we married up our resources, worked together and attempted to elevate the quality, size and overall scope of the films we were both making? But how? By upping the budget, bringing in some of my crew connections and resources, shooting on better more professional equipment and really ultimately making a real film with an experienced (at least partially) cast and crew and creating a true film experience by creating a story with relevance, honest characters, multiple locations, props, special effects and bringing it all to life by whatever means possible.   </p>
<p>November 2020 we went to work.  It started quite simply with me asking Seb two questions, what do you want to do ... what do you really want to make next?  His answer ... Dracula.  Cue my response ... oh no!  Dracula?  Dracula doesn't translate at all to 2020.  It's all about castles, costumes, bats, horse and carriages etc.  Which led to my second question, do you write?  Do you have a writer? No.  Well maybe I'll write it then.  </p>
<p>I decided that whatever form our film took it had to have a solid script to lay the bedrock of the production.  A weak script sets an early tone for disaster.  What I wanted was something smart, somewhat unique for a low budget film, socially relevant without hitting our audience over the head with it and at the end day ... something that we all wanted to see on the screen.</p>
<p>Here we are entering the Summer of 2021 and The Damnation of Dracula is happening.  It's been cast.  A talented dedicated crew has been assembled.  FX are being designed.  Musical compositions are being created and compiled.  Locations are being scouted.  Shot lists and storyboards are being developed.  Costumes.  Props.  You name it ... it's all happening. </p>
<p>We're busy.  We're a small team shouldering an entire film production.  That's the reality of the nature of this type of film BUT ultimately to make it happen we need your help. Financial help.</p>
<p>We can't do it without you. </p>
<h3>Plotting the Undead - The Dawning of a Very Canadian Horror Experience</h3>
<p>    The small northern Canadian communities of Creek and Buffalo Mines are weak and nearly beaten.  Since the closing of the mines a number of years ago the area is a shell of its once thriving past.  The area is mostly made up of seniors and Indigenous people who have inhabited the area for hundreds of years.  To further complicate matters developers have starting clearcutting the land and helping un-earth an evil that begins not only destroying the environment but feeding on the blood of the locals.  </p>
<p>    Eighteen year old Sarah Blackice is forced into taking action when her cousin Jimi is killed and his blood drained.  Sarah , along with her cousin Birdie and their friend Wes approach a local talk radio host on a show about Myths, Monsters and Urban Legends for his expertise in helping combat the evil that has risen.  Together this unlikely team must band together to overcome the dark malevolence they're confronted with. </p>
<p>    The horror they uncover is far more insidious than local legends and myths of Wendigo spirits.  Digging beneath the surface past the frozen earth, through the pine needles and muskeg is a darkness in the form of a hideous creature named Dracula.  Organically rising out the sins of the past and present, years of broken treaties, stolen land and missing and murdered Indigenous women SHE rises, regaining strength to become whole once again.  </p>
<p>    Fortunately for this community they have a sentinel … a guardian in the form of powerful fearless young girl who’s journey and refusal to give up leads her into battle of wits with the Princess of Darkness herself … for the soul of her people and their land.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>We Live in Canada - That's Why We Crowdfund!!! </h3>
<p>The average cost of a Hollywood film is approximately $100 million.  A low budget film is usually in the $3 million dollar range.  Micro-budget films are made in North America for a maximum of $400,000 approximately.  </p>
<p>I've budgeted The Damnation of Dracula out at approximately $27,000.  </p>
<p>Seems laughable but we can make it happen for under $30,000.  What does that pay for?  It covers the bare necessities of a small film production: transportation, make-up FX, insurance, food, accommodations, costumes, rental space and of course paying our cast and crew a little something for the time they're involved in shooting the project. </p>
<p>It's spread thin, corners are cut, extravagances are forgotten but that's the formula for making it happen.  </p>
<p>Your contributions will make this film a reality and I think it's going to be a good one.  This is a special screenplay, at once socially topical and horrifying.  A very Canadian tight wire balancing act for filmmaking.  It's big, not your typical low budget slasher type fare ... this is ambitious to say the least; more than 15 speaking parts and multiple locations around the Niagara Region. </p>
<p>The perks we've created are designed to be delivered promptly and to make contributors feel they're part of something special.  Often on campaigns deliverables fall to the wayside in the hustle and bustle of making a project happen.  We want you to not only help us out but also to feel as though you're part of our community in making this film come to life.  A few of the very special perks we're offering include: playing the role of a creature in the film in full make-up, a signed Vampirella comic from actress/model Ali Chappell, Executive and Associate Producer opportunities, props used in the film etc. </p>
<p>There is no studio system in Canada, tax breaks are tough to come by, funding comes in the form very often of government grants BUT not so often for horror films.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Wait!!! How?!?  For That Kind of Budget!!!</h3>
<p>A reality of the industry is that the ""cash hose"" can put out a lot of fires.  It's easy for a Hollywood production to see an area of concern and wash away that issue was a million dollar solution.  On a production like we're working on $200 feeds a crew for a day.  $1500 covers insurance on costly equipment for a week. $50 pays for a much need costume or two.  </p>
<p>This is meat and potatoes filmmaking.  Very down and dirty blue collar in nature.  I was raised into a hard working family of men that worked the rails.  My mom's family were Indigenous trappers, hunters and fishermen from Northern Ontario who worked the land to survive.  That work ethic was instilled in me from and early age and I've used it to make films.  It's how I made two feature length film documentaries on my own, lighting, directing, producing, writing, shooting and hauling all my own equipment from Fort Erie to Toronto, Buffalo to Texas.  </p>
<p>Seb has made micro budget films for $3000 or less.  I've carried documentary productions on my back for not much more.  This time out ... we're raising the stakes.  We're attempting something you don't see too often in Canada, a grassroots production.  A group of filmmakers, writers, musicians, make-up artists etc. getting together, in the Niagara Region no less and creating a very special feature length film project.  </p>

<h3>The Tombs of Undead</h3>
<p>It's going to be a battle. I've already told Seb that if this doesn't kill all of us just a little we're probably doing something wrong.  </p>
<p>The task at hand is monumental.  Our crew is 12 - 15 members approximately.  An average Hollywood crew is around 575 - 600 people.  A big Hollywood crew like Iron Man III had 3300 members.  We're not Iron Man III.  Everyone has their duties but at the end of the day many hats will be worn by the people involved to make it all happen.  On any given day right now I'm figuring out the logistics of getting prop guns to booking hotels, costumes to food services to feed our cast and crew. </p>
<p>There's going to be tough times ... bad days ... hurdles we may stumble over, that's the reality of making any film.  But our passion for making films and the family like group we've assembled will survive it all.  It's like Francis Ford Coppala said, ""if the stakes are high enough ... you HAVE to succeed.""  </p>
<p>We won't have the ""cash hose"" to throw money at a problem to solve it but what we do have is a relentless pursuit to make a film at any cost.  A tenacious passion to ""make it happen!""  To become part of that 1% who are out there living out a dream. </p>
<h3>Bringing It To Life - The Cast</h3>
<p>It's an eclectic one to say the least.  We've got experienced actors like the fantastic Anthony DP Mann (The Terror of Dracula,  Phantom of the Opera), Ali Chappell (Necropolis: Legion) and Canada's Scream Queen Debbie Rochon (Slime City Massacre, The Deepening).  Relative new comers like Rocky Burnham and Osawa Muskwa (The World Ends at Camp Z).  And actors new to features but with a wealth of production, commercial and video experience, Norma Sue Hill, Michelle Burnett and Alex Sobschak.  </p>

It Lives!!!
We're just a bunch of horror nerds trying to live out our dream by entertaining an audience making horror films.  
The impetus of this project was simple ... I saw that director Sebastien Godin was out there doing it. Making micro-budget film after film: Slimoids, Ouija Mummy, Blood Rites of the Vampyre etc.  I admired his tenacious filmmaking as well as his passion for the horror genre.  I was making documentaries, feature length and shorts, as well as producing a couple of short horror projects but the end goal was always feature length horror films.  
Seb invited me up to North Bay to do some work on his latest film, The Abominations of Frankenstein ... I agreed.  Then I had an idea.  What if I produced Seb's next film?  What if we married up our resources, worked together and attempted to elevate the quality, size and overall scope of the films we were both making? But how? By upping the budget, bringing in some of my crew connections and resources, shooting on better more professional equipment and really ultimately making a real film with an experienced (at least partially) cast and crew and creating a true film experience by creating a story with relevance, honest characters, multiple locations, props, special effects and bringing it all to life by whatever means possible.   
November 2020 we went to work.  It started quite simply with me asking Seb two questions, what do you want to do ... what do you really want to make next?  His answer ... Dracula.  Cue my response ... oh no!  Dracula?  Dracula doesn't translate at all to 2020.  It's all about castles, costumes, bats, horse and carriages etc.  Which led to my second question, do you write?  Do you have a writer? No.  Well maybe I'll write it then.  
I decided that whatever form our film took it had to have a solid script to lay the bedrock of the production.  A weak script sets an early tone for disaster.  What I wanted was something smart, somewhat unique for a low budget film, socially relevant without hitting our audience over the head with it and at the end day ... something that we all wanted to see on the screen.
Here we are entering the Summer of 2021 and The Damnation of Dracula is happening.  It's been cast.  A talented dedicated crew has been assembled.  FX are being designed.  Musical compositions are being created and compiled.  Locations are being scouted.  Shot lists and storyboards are being developed.  Costumes.  Props.  You name it ... it's all happening. 
We're busy.  We're a small team shouldering an entire film production.  That's the reality of the nature of this type of film BUT ultimately to make it happen we need your help. Financial help.
We can't do it without you. 
Plotting the Undead - The Dawning of a Very Canadian Horror Experience
    The small northern Canadian communities of Creek and Buffalo Mines are weak and nearly beaten.  Since the closing of the mines a number of years ago the area is a shell of its once thriving past.  The area is mostly made up of seniors and Indigenous people who have inhabited the area for hundreds of years.  To further complicate matters developers have starting clearcutting the land and helping un-earth an evil that begins not only destroying the environment but feeding on the blood of the locals.  
    Eighteen year old Sarah Blackice is forced into taking action when her cousin Jimi is killed and his blood drained.  Sarah , along with her cousin Birdie and their friend Wes approach a local talk radio host on a show about Myths, Monsters and Urban Legends for his expertise in helping combat the evil that has risen.  Together this unlikely team must band together to overcome the dark malevolence they're confronted with. 
    The horror they uncover is far more insidious than local legends and myths of Wendigo spirits.  Digging beneath the surface past the frozen earth, through the pine needles and muskeg is a darkness in the form of a hideous creature named Dracula.  Organically rising out the sins of the past and present, years of broken treaties, stolen land and missing and murdered Indigenous women SHE rises, regaining strength to become whole once again.  
    Fortunately for this community they have a sentinel … a guardian in the form of powerful fearless young girl who’s journey and refusal to give up leads her into battle of wits with the Princess of Darkness herself … for the soul of her people and their land.

We Live in Canada - That's Why We Crowdfund!!! 
The average cost of a Hollywood film is approximately $100 million.  A low budget film is usually in the $3 million dollar range.  Micro-budget films are made in North America for a maximum of $400,000 approximately.  
I've budgeted The Damnation of Dracula out at approximately $27,000.  
Seems laughable but we can make it happen for under $30,000.  What does that pay for?  It covers the bare necessities of a small film production: transportation, make-up FX, insurance, food, accommodations, costumes, rental space and of course paying our cast and crew a little something for the time they're involved in shooting the project. 
It's spread thin, corners are cut, extravagances are forgotten but that's the formula for making it happen.  
Your contributions will make this film a reality and I think it's going to be a good one.  This is a special screenplay, at once socially topical and horrifying.  A very Canadian tight wire balancing act for filmmaking.  It's big, not your typical low budget slasher type fare ... this is ambitious to say the least; more than 15 speaking parts and multiple locations around the Niagara Region. 
The perks we've created are designed to be delivered promptly and to make contributors feel they're part of something special.  Often on campaigns deliverables fall to the wayside in the hustle and bustle of making a project happen.  We want you to not only help us out but also to feel as though you're part of our community in making this film come to life.  A few of the very special perks we're offering include: playing the role of a creature in the film in full make-up, a signed Vampirella comic from actress/model Ali Chappell, Executive and Associate Producer opportunities, props used in the film etc. 
There is no studio system in Canada, tax breaks are tough to come by, funding comes in the form very often of government grants BUT not so often for horror films.  

Wait!!! How?!?  For That Kind of Budget!!!
A reality of the industry is that the ""cash hose"" can put out a lot of fires.  It's easy for a Hollywood production to see an area of concern and wash away that issue was a million dollar solution.  On a production like we're working on $200 feeds a crew for a day.  $1500 covers insurance on costly equipment for a week. $50 pays for a much need costume or two.  
This is meat and potatoes filmmaking.  Very down and dirty blue collar in nature.  I was raised into a hard working family of men that worked the rails.  My mom's family were Indigenous trappers, hunters and fishermen from Northern Ontario who worked the land to survive.  That work ethic was instilled in me from and early age and I've used it to make films.  It's how I made two feature length film documentaries on my own, lighting, directing, producing, writing, shooting and hauling all my own equipment from Fort Erie to Toronto, Buffalo to Texas.  
Seb has made micro budget films for $3000 or less.  I've carried documentary productions on my back for not much more.  This time out ... we're raising the stakes.  We're attempting something you don't see too often in Canada, a grassroots production.  A group of filmmakers, writers, musicians, make-up artists etc. getting together, in the Niagara Region no less and creating a very special feature length film project.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>When the two goddesses of creation and destruction come together in an unrelenting battle, they discover strength in unity. </i></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>THE STORY</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Creation and destruction are pulled together by two goddesses at war. Out of their duel comes transformation. Twin Flame is an ode to the death of the Ego, and the realisation that despite their differences; these women cannot exist without each other.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">With rich imagery, the film will deconstruct what it means to embrace and/or reject feminine archetypes, focusing on toxic parent/child relationships, and bringing a sense of modernity to an ancient form of storytelling.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The entire story will be told through Indian Classical dance (Kathak), Abhinaya, Physical theatre and contemporary movement. A soundtrack composed by world renowned musicians Parvyn Singh, Josh Bennet and Jay Dabgar will accompany us through the duration of the film. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Our story focuses on two women inspired by the Hindu Goddesses Kali and Parvati. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">THE CHARACTERS</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><u>Parvati (पावती, Pārvatī)</u><br/><br/>The Hindu goddess of fertility, love, beauty, marriage, children, and<br/>devotion; as well as of divine strength and power. In Hindu belief, she is the recreative energy and power of Shiva, and she is the cause of a bond that connects all beings and a means of their spiritual release. Parvati is also the goddess of love and devotion, or Kamakshi; the<br/>goddess of fertility, abundance and food/nourishment.</i></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><u>Kali (का लका, kä′lē)</u><br/><br/>The dark goddess of destruction.<br/>The Goddess Kali has several origin stories, but it is popularly believed that Kali emerged from the forehead of Goddess Durga, whilst engaged in battle with Mahisa; a buffalo demon. Durga’s anger was so powerful it sprung forth Kali- the epitome of her rage.  The original ‘take no nonsense’ inspiration for strong women everywhere, Kali is headstrong and courageous, and will do anything to gatekeep the balance of order and chaos.</i></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">These insular, polar opposites are forced together by the birth of Parvati's child, shifting their perceptions and compelling them to see another side to themselves.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">ORIGINS</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Twin Flame bridges the gap between authentic South-Asian storytelling within a fresh, contemporary landscape. The film is inspired by our heritage, the rich worlds of Hindu mythology, and our own internal battles brought to life with dance and movement. </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Originally conceptualised in the depths of the 2020 lockdown; what started as a small idea for a stage show turned into a 20 minute dance film. As we began to develop the story and discuss our vision, we soon realised that this project was larger than we had ever imagined, and it deserved to reach its full potential. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WHY ?</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><br/>To put it simply... this has never been done before.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We're not aiming to make a generic 'dance film. If that were the case we're well versed in doing things the starving artist way, and would have begged, borrowed and snuck into an abandoned warehouse to make it! </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We prefer to view this project as a 20 minute visual art film, with dance and original compositions to assist the storytelling.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> The level of detail and artistry required for this film means being able to fund artisans and experts to help bring this film to life and give it the authenticity it deserves. It sits within the realm of 'Fantasy' but under the surface there is a truth and grit that will resonate with our audiences, regardless of cultural heritage. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We are passionate about feminist filmmaking, and representation is hugely important to us. As people of colour, and as queer women, we want to create a film that is authentic but uniquely told from our worldview. This can prove difficult when applying for grants, as most funding bodies in Australia are looking for a very specific style of project, and often stories like this one are misinterpreted or hard to conceptualise. But our vision is so clear that we know with the right backing and our talented crew, we'll be able to produce a visually stunning and engaging film that can hopefully be appreciated by film festival audiences and art galleries worldwide. </p>

When the two goddesses of creation and destruction come together in an unrelenting battle, they discover strength in unity. 
THE STORY
Creation and destruction are pulled together by two goddesses at war. Out of their duel comes transformation. Twin Flame is an ode to the death of the Ego, and the realisation that despite their differences; these women cannot exist without each other.
With rich imagery, the film will deconstruct what it means to embrace and/or reject feminine archetypes, focusing on toxic parent/child relationships, and bringing a sense of modernity to an ancient form of storytelling.
The entire story will be told through Indian Classical dance (Kathak), Abhinaya, Physical theatre and contemporary movement. A soundtrack composed by world renowned musicians Parvyn Singh, Josh Bennet and Jay Dabgar will accompany us through the duration of the film. 
 
Our story focuses on two women inspired by the Hindu Goddesses Kali and Parvati. 
 
THE CHARACTERS
 
Parvati (पावती, Pārvatī)The Hindu goddess of fertility, love, beauty, marriage, children, anddevotion; as well as of divine strength and power. In Hindu belief, she is the recreative energy and power of Shiva, and she is the cause of a bond that connects all beings and a means of their spiritual release. Parvati is also the goddess of love and devotion, or Kamakshi; thegoddess of fertility, abundance and food/nourishment.

 
Kali (का लका, kä′lē)The dark goddess of destruction.The Goddess Kali has several origin stories, but it is popularly believed that Kali emerged from the forehead of Goddess Durga, whilst engaged in battle with Mahisa; a buffalo demon. Durga’s anger was so powerful it sprung forth Kali- the epitome of her rage.  The original ‘take no nonsense’ inspiration for strong women everywhere, Kali is headstrong and courageous, and will do anything to gatekeep the balance of order and chaos.

 
These insular, polar opposites are forced together by the birth of Parvati's child, shifting their perceptions and compelling them to see another side to themselves.  
 
ORIGINS
Twin Flame bridges the gap between authentic South-Asian storytelling within a fresh, contemporary landscape. The film is inspired by our heritage, the rich worlds of Hindu mythology, and our own internal battles brought to life with dance and movement. 
Originally conceptualised in the depths of the 2020 lockdown; what started as a small idea for a stage show turned into a 20 minute dance film. As we began to develop the story and discuss our vision, we soon realised that this project was larger than we had ever imagined, and it deserved to reach its full potential. 
 
WHY ?
To put it simply... this has never been done before.
We're not aiming to make a generic 'dance film. If that were the case we're well versed in doing things the starving artist way, and would have begged, borrowed and snuck into an abandoned warehouse to make it! 
We prefer to view this project as a 20 minute visual art film, with dance and original compositions to assist the storytelling.  
 The level of detail and artistry required for this film means being able to fund artisans and experts to help bring this film to life and give it the authenticity it deserves. It sits within the realm of 'Fantasy' but under the surface there is a truth and grit that will resonate with our audiences, regardless of cultural heritage. 
 

The Impact
 
We are passionate about feminist filmmaking, and representation is hugely important to us. As people of colour, and as queer women, we want to create a film that is authentic but uniquely told from our worldview. This can prove difficult when applying for grants, as most funding bodies in Australia are looking for a very specific style of project, and often stories like this one are misinterpreted or hard to conceptualise. But our vision is so clear that we know with the right backing and our talented crew, we'll be able to produce a visually stunning and engaging film that can hopefully be appreciated by film festival audiences and art galleries worldwide.

<p><strong>Cast</strong> - With intense scenes and emotionally charged characters, our actors will bring the project to life. We want to respect their hard work most of all since they have to be vulnerable in front of the camera. Actors put in so much time and effort, and we need them to know how much we care! </p>
<p><strong>Crew/ Labor</strong> - People used to say it to me all the time, but it’s true: a film takes a village. We really believe in paying as much as we can to our crew. Given that we have an ambitious shoot, we absolutely cannot lower our crew rates. We respect the hard work these individuals put in, and we’re always humbled by the amazing work we see on set. </p>
<p><strong>Locations</strong> - How do you sell reality? Shoot it. We need an old Western town and a realistic, standing hospital set. To pull this off, we need the big bucks. We’ll also be putting our cast and crew up in lodging for the old Western town since it’s outside of Los Angeles County. To properly accommodate people, we need to pad our Locations budget more. </p>
<p><strong>Equipment Rentals</strong> - These are the technical inventions and innovations that capture reality and transmit it to digital files. From the camera and lenses to lights and c-stands, we’ll be ensuring a proper production. We have good relationships with equipment vendors in L.A., and we’re very excited to capitalize on them for our first feature. </p>
<p><strong>Production Supplies</strong> - If we don’t have extra batteries, do you think the sound person will be able to charge their equipment or will the makeup artist be able to use their devices? Production Supplies are an essential part of any show as walkie talkies and orange cones create active communication and safety. We believe in professional procedures! </p>
<p><strong>Contingency</strong> - When the well runs dry, what do you do? Well… plan for it. Contingency or emergency funds go a long way to ensuring we’ll be able to carry through with our vision even if disasters ensue. We know we’ll be ready by planning for 10% of the preliminary budget to go straight toward contingency. </p>
<p><strong>Crowdfunding Fees</strong> - A service like this is extremely valuable in connecting us directly with you, our initial audience. This comes at a cost of course.</p>
<p><strong>Food</strong> - Back in the day, the Egyptians made some pyramids. It’s unclear how much the workers ate. Either way, food is now an integral part of any workforce. We want people to have breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We’ve been on way too many sets where cereal is lunch, and bagels are dinner. We don’t want that for anyone. The best work is based on good meals. </p>
<p><strong>Post-Production</strong> - As directors, we always feel that once we shoot the script, we’re done. Easy, hand it to the post-team. Right? Wrong. We need to have the budget to accommodate sound design, color, composing, visual effects, music licensing, and basic editing. We plan to be our own assistant editors, but we’ll need talented artists to help take this film to completion and inevitably get it into festivals. If we’re lucky, we’ll be able to sell it to Netflix or Amazon!</p>

<h3><strong>Writer's Statement</strong></h3>
<p><b>By Matthew Marder</b></p>
<p>This screenplay is designed to do two things: make you laugh and make you cry. I grew up on Westerns. I loved them as a kid. But as I aged, I noticed many Westerns were plagued with sexist and racist depictions, vilifying certain groups of people (i.e. Native Americans) while celebrating troubled cowboys, mostly misogynistic white men. I always thought it’d be fascinating to explore a Western with a female protagonist who’s disturbed by the ways of the West and must take action under her own moral code. The West has become a myth on its own in American culture, and this project explores that to the hilt. GOLD MINE is an ambivalent love song to Westerns, appreciating their philosophy while noting their shortcomings. </p>
<p>When my dad died suddenly in the fall of 2017, I was broken. He provided so much guidance in my life, even getting me into movies in the first place. We loved watching High Noon together. I wanted to write a very personal piece that dissected shock and grief in the moment it forms in the hospital. The ICU is such a specific place, and I wanted to capture that feeling like it’s never been captured before: on the crossroads of life and death, not knowing if you’re staying or leaving. But I didn’t want this to be a depressing story so the darkly comedic tone sprinkled throughout the tale is meant for audiences to appreciate that life usually throws everything at you at once. I miss my dad every day, and I hope this project is able to pay his memory forward. GOLD MINE was written for all those who’ve lost a loved one or friend. It’s never an easy process, and we all go through it.</p>
<h3><strong>Directors' Statement</strong></h3>
<p><strong>by Matthew Marder and Adam Chase Cohen</strong></p>
<p>We’ve been working independently and collaborating on projects in Los Angeles for over five years. With successful festival wins and fun premieres, we’ve enjoyed making our work with an amazing community of diverse and passionate artists. But the grind is real and the hustle is endless; we’ve tried to work all jobs from development through full scale production. As independent producers, directors, and writers, we’ve created projects whose budgets have ranged from small indie to large union scales. </p>
<p>Now we’re ready to take the huge leap and make our first feature. Only there’s one catch. We’re only partially funded. So we need your help! Why? Because we want to make a movie that entertains audiences and connects to people on a personal level. We hope to provide a fun experience on all levels, but this campaign is the crucial missing piece in our production puzzle to make this movie come to life. Without this campaign, we don’t think we can reach our goal of getting this movie through festivals and eventually onto a platform like Amazon or Netflix! </p>
<p>We’ve loved the modern takes on Westerns in projects like Westworld, The Rider, and Hostiles. We’re also huge sci-fi fans and think the genre can provide a great arena for thought-provoking questions. We know we can make a unique movie and, specifically, a new entry in the Western genre: Juxtaposing vivid pop performances from the future with visceral duels from the past while combating gender stereotypes -- it’s all going to be a good time. So saddle up and join us on the dusty trail for GOLD MINE!</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>This is an ambitious first feature as it’s a sci-fi western which usually contains expensive components. Still, we have put in so much legwork already to make our vision achievable. We have collaborated with creative folks, many of whom have already been so inspired by this story that they are offering huge discounts on their services and equipment. We’ve tried to figure out ways to minimize VFX and additional costs while still unravelling a compelling sci-fi narrative. We’ve even figured out a way of shooting around one Western location and even integrating horses in a cost-effective manner. </p>
<p>Despite the best laid plans, problems can arise. There is always a risk that an actor gets sick, or that a piece of equipment fails. To avoid these disasters and improvise as best as possible, we are bringing on the best technical teams possible and budget for contingency plans. Our production experience is drawing in a team that's already showing up to join our adventure. This makes us confident that we can produce this movie soup to nuts for under $300,000.</p>
<p>We’re most excited about shooting in an old Western town which may present strong weather conditions (windy nights, sandstorms, etc) and no signs of life other than one wee film crew. Like Will Kane, the protagonist in High Noon, we hope to stand strong and carry on our mission of making Gold Mine a reality. </p> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1626662784/sonhnsaxq7gwtcejdtj5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

With successful festival wins and fun premieres, we’ve enjoyed making our work with an amazing community of diverse and passionate artists. But the grind is real and the hustle is endless; we’ve tried to work all jobs from development through full scale production. As independent producers, directors, and writers, we’ve created projects whose budgets have ranged from small indie to large union scales. 
Now we’re ready to take the huge leap and make our first feature. Only there’s one catch. We’re only partially funded. So we need your help! Why? Because we want to make a movie that entertains audiences and connects to people on a personal level. We hope to provide a fun experience on all levels, but this campaign is the crucial missing piece in our production puzzle to make this movie come to life. Without this campaign, we don’t think we can reach our goal of getting this movie through festivals and eventually onto a platform like Amazon or Netflix! 
We’ve loved the modern takes on Westerns in projects like Westworld, The Rider, and Hostiles. We’re also huge sci-fi fans and think the genre can provide a great arena for thought-provoking questions. We know we can make a unique movie and, specifically, a new entry in the Western genre: Juxtaposing vivid pop performances from the future with visceral duels from the past while combating gender stereotypes -- it’s all going to be a good time. So saddle up and join us on the dusty trail for GOLD MINE!

Risks & Challenges
This is an ambitious first feature as it’s a sci-fi western which usually contains expensive components. Still, we have put in so much legwork already to make our vision achievable. We have collaborated with creative folks, many of whom have already been so inspired by this story that they are offering huge discounts on their services and equipment. We’ve tried to figure out ways to minimize VFX and additional costs while still unravelling a compelling sci-fi narrative. We’ve even figured out a way of shooting around one Western location and even integrating horses in a cost-effective manner. 
Despite the best laid plans, problems can arise. There is always a risk that an actor gets sick, or that a piece of equipment fails. To avoid these disasters and improvise as best as possible, we are bringing on the best technical teams possible and budget for contingency plans. Our production experience is drawing in a team that's already showing up to join our adventure. This makes us confident that we can produce this movie soup to nuts for under $300,000.
We’re most excited about shooting in an old Western town which may present strong weather conditions (windy nights, sandstorms, etc) and no signs of life other than one wee film crew. Like Will Kane, the protagonist in High Noon, we hope to stand strong and carry on our mission of making Gold Mine a reality.

<p><strong><i>Dylan's New Nightmare</i> </strong> acts as an <strong>unofficial sequel</strong> to <strong>Wes Craven's: A New Nightmare</strong>, one of the most unique and high concept installments to the <strong>Nightmare on Elm Street Franchise</strong>. </p>
<p>This short film picks up 25 years after the events of New Nightmare and follows <strong>Dylan Porter (Miko Hughes)</strong>, the young son of Heather Langenkamp, now a grown man trying to make his way in the world his parents raised him in—Hollywood. Little does he know that the evil entity known as <strong>Freddy Krueger is back</strong>, and eager to once again break into <i>our </i> world through the son of his favorite victim!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568850454/u8x3yir3a6rdfyl9fjo8.jpg"" src=""""/></h2>
<p>This project was conceived by Cecil Laird, who has loved the horror genre ever since he was a kid. Freddy Krueger has always been his favorite slasher, so when he was deciding what <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/TheHorrorShowChannel"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Horror Show</a>'s next huge project should be, a sequel to <i>Wes Craven's New Nightmare</i> clawed its way into his head and just wouldn't leave! So the project began.</p>
<p>Luckily, to ensure that this fan film is of the highest quality, we have enlisted the incredible help of <strong>Producer</strong>, <strong>Vincente DiSanti</strong>, the creative force behind <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgxi13lkkleF0xaO684BklQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Womp Stomp Films</a> and the widely successful <i>Friday the 13<sup>th</sup></i> fan film, <i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K_wkQSM8xM&amp;t=121s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Never Hike Alone</a>,</i>  as well as  <strong>Rene Rivas</strong>, the man behind that excellent Halloween fan film, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoiRRBTSzi8&amp;t=2s"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>The Spirit of Haddonfield</i></a>,  as both <strong>Producer</strong> and <strong>Director of Photography</strong>! We are also lucky enough to welcome <strong>Nora Hewitt</strong>, the winner of season 9 of FaceOff, to jump on board do our <strong>Special Make-Up and FX Supervisor</strong> for the film!</p>
<p>But even as cool as this whole project is up to this point, there's something even <i>cooler</i>! We couldn't be <i>more</i> excited to announce that<strong> MIKO HUGHES</strong> himself will be reprising his role as Dylan Porter, the son of Heather Langenkamp from the original <i>Wes Craven's New Nightmare</i>! That's right! Miko is <i>back</i>!</p>
<p>So obviously, with all of these talented individuals, plus original costuming and props being designed for the flick by people very close to the franchise, this project is sure to be a film that belongs on every horror fan's shelf, right next to the rest of their <i>Nightmare</i> collection!</p>

<p>Being that the short film is not-for-profit, our goal is really just to put out a film that not only makes the fans and creators of the <i>Nightmare on Elm Street</i> series proud. We'd also love it if this fan film ended up being one that they want to add to their collection <i>so</i> much, that they contribute to <i>this </i>campaign, because that’s the ONLY way they’ll be able to!</p>
<p>Now, in order to make this the biggest and best Freddy fan film we can, we need <i>your</i> help! We have enough for a very small-budgeted short piece right now, but with the assistance of real Nightmare fans, we can make this short film everything we know if can be.</p>
<p>Our financial goal is to raise <strong>$40,000</strong>, which will go towards the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Permits &amp; Insurance</li>
<li>Gear &amp; Vehicle Rentals</li>
<li>Stunts</li>
<li>Cast &amp; Crew Costs</li>

We're here to make your nightmares come true!
 


Dylan's New Nightmare  acts as an unofficial sequel to Wes Craven's: A New Nightmare, one of the most unique and high concept installments to the Nightmare on Elm Street Franchise. 
This short film picks up 25 years after the events of New Nightmare and follows Dylan Porter (Miko Hughes), the young son of Heather Langenkamp, now a grown man trying to make his way in the world his parents raised him in—Hollywood. Little does he know that the evil entity known as Freddy Krueger is back, and eager to once again break into our  world through the son of his favorite victim!
 

This project was conceived by Cecil Laird, who has loved the horror genre ever since he was a kid. Freddy Krueger has always been his favorite slasher, so when he was deciding what The Horror Show's next huge project should be, a sequel to Wes Craven's New Nightmare clawed its way into his head and just wouldn't leave! So the project began.
Luckily, to ensure that this fan film is of the highest quality, we have enlisted the incredible help of Producer, Vincente DiSanti, the creative force behind Womp Stomp Films and the widely successful Friday the 13th fan film, Never Hike Alone,  as well as  Rene Rivas, the man behind that excellent Halloween fan film, The Spirit of Haddonfield,  as both Producer and Director of Photography! We are also lucky enough to welcome Nora Hewitt, the winner of season 9 of FaceOff, to jump on board do our Special Make-Up and FX Supervisor for the film!
But even as cool as this whole project is up to this point, there's something even cooler! We couldn't be more excited to announce that MIKO HUGHES himself will be reprising his role as Dylan Porter, the son of Heather Langenkamp from the original Wes Craven's New Nightmare! That's right! Miko is back!
So obviously, with all of these talented individuals, plus original costuming and props being designed for the flick by people very close to the franchise, this project is sure to be a film that belongs on every horror fan's shelf, right next to the rest of their Nightmare collection!
 


Being that the short film is not-for-profit, our goal is really just to put out a film that not only makes the fans and creators of the Nightmare on Elm Street series proud. We'd also love it if this fan film ended up being one that they want to add to their collection so much, that they contribute to this campaign, because that’s the ONLY way they’ll be able to!
Now, in order to make this the biggest and best Freddy fan film we can, we need your help! We have enough for a very small-budgeted short piece right now, but with the assistance of real Nightmare fans, we can make this short film everything we know if can be.
Our financial goal is to raise $40,000, which will go towards the following:

Permits & Insurance
Gear & Vehicle Rentals
Stunts
Cast & Crew Costs
Location Costs
Production Costs
Special Makeup & Gore FX
Original Score Creation Costs
Perk Costs

*Note: If we do not reach our goal, we will proceed with the film using the funds we raise, so backers WILL see a project, no matter what!

 

We do have plenty of stretch goals, which would fund numerous ways we could bolster the production, including:

Higher-quality overall production
More involved practical special effects
Extra location time
An extra kill or two
Extra casting
More in-depth post-production process

 

So even if we've already achieved our goal, don't hesitate to still contribute! The perks are worth it!  Speaking of...
 

We are offering some AMAZING perks for you Nightmare fans who can't wait for another, if unofficial, entry into the Freddy canon! Check them out and choose what looks best for you!

Your Name in the End Credits as a special ""Thank You""
A Digital Download Pack, including the film, the score, & more

Three Original Posters of the film - both signed and unsigned options

A replica Dylan's New Nightmare Original Glove (limited #)

New perks will be dropped along the way so keep checking back to make sure you don't miss out on something really cool! Our high-end tiers give you a chance to join the Nightmare as an actual Producer, which allows you exclusive access to an inside look into the project, along with behind the scenes material nobody else will see for a very long time, if ever! Additionally, YOUR NAME will appear in the opening credits of the film.
Producers will not only have a direct line of communication with our team, but they are also permitted to visit the set during production, or even help out as part of the crew. But they must behave themselves...or Freddy will see them out!

 

 

The role of Dylan will be reprised by none other than Miko Hughes himself, who originated the character 25 years ago in the original Wes Craven's New Nightmare! Miko has had a life-long career in film and TV, both in front of and behind the camera, since all the way back in 1989 when he played little Gage Creed in the original Pet Sematary. Miko is excited to face off against Freddy once again, and can't wait to show you how the last 25 years have treated Dylan!

 

The role of Freddy will be played by Dave McRae, a full time professional voice actor and independent filmmaker. Dave is a four-time (2015, 2016, 2018 & 2019) Voice Arts Award Nominee. Three times for Outstanding National TV Promo, and once for Outstanding Body of Work.

Wishing for Joe Iconis' musical ""THE BLACK SUITS"" to come back, I decided to make my own NON-PROFIT filmed adaptation music videos of some songs from that musical! All videos will be going up on my filmmaking channel, linked below!https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxf2hkgFFWN50f1Ezv0WvOQ CAST AND CREWOur cast is full of extremely talented actors and actresses! Alongside them and behind the camera, I, myself, Ethan Koester am the director, cinematographer, executive producer and editor. Jalen Smith is co-producer and helping make everything come to life.Helping us with recreating instrumentals we have Adam Doucette on piano, Hyo Kim making the guitar, drums and bass for ""The Answer"", Joey Carrier on bass for ""Amphibian"", and a fellow student Jaren on drums for ""Amphibian"".JOHN AMOROSO - Chris Trevino""Pop Tarts, Power Cords + Brotherhood."" The main focus of the song ""The Answer"" is the character John Amoroso, who is being played by the amazing Chris Trevino! Chris has been an actor and singer for a long time, and we know he will do the role justice. CHRISTOPHER THURSER - Chaminda HangilipolaThe leader of the band, Chris Thurser is being played by the awesome Chaminda Hangilipola, a very talented actor/singer! Chris is a pretty complex character, wanting to be the strong-willed leader, while suffering from an anxiety disorder that he really struggles with especially when his band is on the verge of falling apart. We have full faith that Chaminda will absolutely nail this role! BRANDON KEESE - Jalen Smith
Brandon Keese, the brains, the brilliant, the BERKLEE! I knew from the start I wanted Jalen Smith as Brandon! Having years of experience playing drums, (Brandon's iconic role in the band) and having a personality eerily similar to the character's, Jalen is more than ready to step up, being a talented actor, drummer and singer! NATO OBENKRIEGER - Jamal TanksOf course, the fan favorite amphibian himself, Nato Obenkrieger is being played by Jamal Tanks! While fairly new to theater as a whole, Jamal is still a great actor FULL of energy and enthusiasm to take on this iconic role! (Almost the same chaotically fun energy as a certain bass player from a certain band?) He can't wait to bring the L.I. Amphibian to life! LISA BRED - Laura Zoog""Ladies and gentlemen, Lisa Bred!"" Lisa is being portrayed by the wonderful, super-fantastic, coolness, remarkable Laura Zoog! Being a very talented singer/songwriter and an amazing actress, Laura is a great pick to play Lisa! I've literally never heard a singing voice quite like hers, and I can't wait to see her blow you away with her performance of ""Blue Hair""! BUDGETTING DONATIONSFor anyone who donates, we hope you enjoy our special perks offered for your generosity!

<h3>AGW </h3>
<p>Jay Helgerson has lived his life in accordance with his need to run. In the 1948 film <i>The Red Shoes,</i> Moira Shearer plays a dancer who is asked, ""Why do you dance?"" She replies, ""Why do you live?"". So it is with Jay. </p>
<p>My name is Lexie Helgerson. I'm an artist, a teacher and an athlete. In 2015 I began this project, interviewing family and friends of my dad in an effort to understand his life as a marathon runner and father of three. </p>
<p>At first glance, Jay appears to be an eccentric runner.  Our documentary follows Jay for five years leading to the 2020 Boston Marathon where he aims to again claim the title “Age Group Winner.”  Like Rocky, he doesn't expect to win.  He just wants a shot, a shot to go the distance. </p>
<p>We discover that he may in fact be the ideal role model for anyone who longs to simplify their life in a quest for inner peace and self-discovery; ideal partially because he would immediately and vehemently dismiss such a notion as really weird.  In his own words, “I’d rather talk about running than all that spiritual stuff…”</p>
<p>Jay doesn’t see himself as anything but a regular guy, although at times he admits to being “out there.”  He runs every day.  But not just one run. Several times in an average day, he goes out for 5 or 6 or 10 miles. He does not stretch. He doesn’t do Pilates or yoga.  He’s an extremely picky eater but he doesn’t chug health drinks.  He eats bananas and ice-cream and pizza and drinks Corona and Coca-Cola. </p>
<p>You will witness Jay contradict himself in different ways.  He speaks of the need for his daughters to have secure employment and a safety-net.  And yet, he hasn’t had a job in over 40 years.  He says he has gotten by with some “family money” but he lives an extremely spartan lifestyle.  Jay downplays the idea that running has a spiritual benefit.  Considering these facts, it’s remarkable that Jay is known to regularly give clothes away to homeless people in his community.  </p>
<p>My dad is a mercurial person. He doesn't like being interviewed or filmed. I'll pull out the camera, and he'll say, ""I don't wanna be in it..."" and then, two minutes later jokes that he should have his own YouTube channel.  He agreed to participate because he'd do just about anything for his kids and he lives to run.  Running, that's what my dad wants this film to be about, but when somebody lives an extraordinary life, it's overwhelmingly tempting to draw meaning from it. </p>

</li>
<li>Super 8mm film development: $3,000<ul>

<h3>Why AGW?</h3>
<ul>
<li>AGW offers the world the chance to see a man, at age 65, literally race the clock and push his body to the limit. </li>

<li>AGW offers hope. As Kathrine Switzer, the first woman to run the Boston Marathon with an official number, says, ""If you are losing faith in human nature, go out and watch a marathon.""</li>
<li>AGW offers the world the chance to see a daughter tell the story of her father, who not only was the first person in the world to run 52 marathons in a year, but was also a stay-at-home dad who raised three daughters and has managed to live as a divorcé without a traditional career. </li>
<li>And as James Baldwin says, ""People can't, unhappily, invent their mooring posts, their lovers and their friends, anymore than they can invent their parents. Life gives these and also takes them away and the great difficulty is to say Yes to life."" </li>

<h3>What's This All About?</h3>
<p>Vampa Del'Ombra is the alter ego of me, Mara Powell. I am an independent writer/director/actor from St. Clair Shores, MI with a passion for filmmaking, storytelling and style. As Vampa, I've made two short horror-comedy films, ""Cannabis Cannibals"" and ""Murder Pool"" and now, I'm looking to complete a third, ""An Occasion of Sin"" which will round out a trilogy I call ""Vampa's Visions"". </p>
<p>""An Occasion of Sin"" is adapted from a short I originally wrote 20 years ago. Like it's author, it's undergone many changes over these past two decades, but the heart remains the same. This would be my most ambitious film to date, and having the experience of the last two shorts, I think myself and my crew are ready to give this short the care I think it deserves.</p>
<p>My 3rd short, this is only the springboard to my filmmaking endeavors and your contributions will help me achieve what I know will be my best one yet! </p>
<div> </div>
</div><div>
<h3>I Don't Want Sumthin' for Nuthin'!</h3>
<p>Bluntly, I estimate that I would need about $900. This would pay for essentials to make this specific film, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>car rental</li>
<li>props</li>
<li>costumes</li>
<li>gore FX (this is a horror story!)</li>
<li>extra would go towards entering the movie into film festivals</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>For your hard-earned cash, you'll get all sorts of cool exclusives! These, based on your pledge, range from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Special thanks in the credits</li>
<li>Access to a special Playlist with music that inspired the script</li>
<li>Exclusive BTS footage and stills </li>
<li>Downloads to both ""Cannabis Cannibals"" &amp; ""Murder Pool""</li>
<li>First access to viewing ""An Occasion of Sin"" as soon as it's completed</li>
<li>Mini movie posters</li>
<li>Exclusive Vampa's Visions tee</li>
<li>My eternal gratitude</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Even if the goal isn't met, any and all funds raised will  go directly to towards funding this project.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Making any movie is a risk and a challenge in of itself. Even the best laid plans can sometimes go awry. Anything can go wrong and sometimes the days on set don't go exactly as they were supposed to. Things can end up taking a lot longer than intended. The past two movies I made proved this true. However, that didn't stop us and those movies were still completed.</p>
<p>Of course, this time, the overarching risks and challenges are also due to Covid-19. I don't intend on doing anything unsafe, or taking any unnecessary health risks. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you don't have the cash to give, hey, I get it. But please know that your kind words of support to me, your likes on my social media posts, or your thumbs up and comments on my YouTube videos are legit contributions to this project! Also, sharing this project on social media and letting all of your rich relatives and friends know about it would be awesome, too.</p>

As Vampa, I've made two short horror-comedy films, ""Cannabis Cannibals"" and ""Murder Pool"" and now, I'm looking to complete a third, ""An Occasion of Sin"" which will round out a trilogy I call ""Vampa's Visions"". 
""An Occasion of Sin"" is adapted from a short I originally wrote 20 years ago. Like it's author, it's undergone many changes over these past two decades, but the heart remains the same. This would be my most ambitious film to date, and having the experience of the last two shorts, I think myself and my crew are ready to give this short the care I think it deserves.
My 3rd short, this is only the springboard to my filmmaking endeavors and your contributions will help me achieve what I know will be my best one yet! 
 

I Don't Want Sumthin' for Nuthin'!
Bluntly, I estimate that I would need about $900. This would pay for essentials to make this specific film, like:

car rental
props
costumes
gore FX (this is a horror story!)
extra would go towards entering the movie into film festivals

 
For your hard-earned cash, you'll get all sorts of cool exclusives! These, based on your pledge, range from:

Special thanks in the credits
Access to a special Playlist with music that inspired the script
Exclusive BTS footage and stills 
Downloads to both ""Cannabis Cannibals"" & ""Murder Pool""
First access to viewing ""An Occasion of Sin"" as soon as it's completed
Mini movie posters
Exclusive Vampa's Visions tee
My eternal gratitude

 
Even if the goal isn't met, any and all funds raised will  go directly to towards funding this project.
 

Risks & Challenges
Making any movie is a risk and a challenge in of itself. Even the best laid plans can sometimes go awry. Anything can go wrong and sometimes the days on set don't go exactly as they were supposed to. Things can end up taking a lot longer than intended. The past two movies I made proved this true. However, that didn't stop us and those movies were still completed.
Of course, this time, the overarching risks and challenges are also due to Covid-19. I don't intend on doing anything unsafe, or taking any unnecessary health risks. 
 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you don't have the cash to give, hey, I get it. But please know that your kind words of support to me, your likes on my social media posts, or your thumbs up and comments on my YouTube videos are legit contributions to this project! Also, sharing this project on social media and letting all of your rich relatives and friends know about it would be awesome, too.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
<p>BLACKOUT is about a bisexual man, Gabriel, who is at a crossroads between choosing his happiness in life, or holding onto the ghosts of his past.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>The LOVE:</p>
<p>We can all resonate with self-empowerment when it comes to Love, and how important it is to love yourself, despite any obstacles that comes into your life, you can still live your life!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>YOU:</p>
<p>Not only will your contribution give us the chance to create opportunities, diversity and representation for everyone, especially for women, minorities, and members of the LGBTQ+ communities, but your contribution will also add to our calling card to get investors involved for bigger productions such as feature films and TV series. We want to continue to break down doors for those who want to create as well. All of our cast and crew members have created projects of their own. Those who have worked with us in the past were given opportunities to promote themselves to more work within their own careers. We don't only work with people that work for us and exclude all other dreamers. We work with people and empower them to create their own paths.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>The total costs for permits, insurance, equipment, possible pick up shots tend to round out to a little over 6K. We raised 1200 from our previous campaigns. We just need the remaining  balance to finish the legalities of creating a legal and safe set so that we only focus on the production part of the project.</li>
<li>Our campaign gives YOU a movie ticket to our private screening. This will allow contributors a sneak peak before it premieres to film festivals, and then to the public. They will be the first audience to get the first preview. Sponsors get screen credit thank you mentions.</li>
<li>For contributors who donate over $100, you will be part of the producing team, get IMDB credit, screen credit, and exclusive behind the scenes look.</li>
<li>Every cent will go into production, regardless of whether or not we reach our goal. We still have $1200 from our previous campaigns and fundraising events that is there in the production account, which will be used solely for BLACKOUT. What is lacked in the campaign, production will have to work multiple jobs to pay out of our pockets. We could use your contribution to lift the hefty costs in Los Angeles.</li>
<li>Production will still happen, regardless of this outcome. We have and will continue to invest from our end. We pay our cast and crew as well as catering and parking, which costs over $2000, but prefer not to have to worry about extra costs that will create a dent into our already planned budget. We want relief in all areas of locations and equipment that is needed for safety on set, so that cast and crew will be safe.</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>

<li>Our priority is to give you a high quality, meaningful and powerful tale.</li>
<li>Whatever happens, we will film in October. BLACKOUT has already been delayed due to low funds. We don't want to keep cast, crew and our contributors waiting, so we are locked down for October of this year.</li>
<li>Our production company is investing out of our own pockets for the cast and crew. Because of taxes on permits and insurance, those are extra costs, and that tends to be hefty on our pockets, which is why your contribution is vital. We want to give you the highest quality filmmaking.</li>

<p>Our aim is to offer a Coming Out story that captures the audience’s imagination, eliciting surprise, empathy and humour at the absurdity and tragedy of Eve’s dilemma, supported by a host of strong characters made up of family and friends whose own reactions, prejudices and fractious encounters offer a wealth of comic and dramatic moments.   </p>
<p><br/>We want to show a young bride that most women could identify with, following a well-trodden path to marriage to her long term boyfriend. Still, we plan to disorient the audience by eliciting their empathy for a woman they soon learn is lesbian, who feels paralysed as to what action to take as she confronts her long term partner with her revelation. </p>

<p>We believe this LGBTQ+ slant on a runaway bride story using the genre of comedy-drama is original in concept, and can offer surprising and farcical moments that would entertain audiences through the bizarre encounters and heated exchanges between the couple and their friends and families, as well as rendering a compelling emotional drama that explores the plight of a woman now acknowledging her sexuality.</p>
<p>After completing this short film and taking it out to festivals, we plan to pitch it to TV Production companies and online platforms to further develop Eve's story arc into a limited TV series.</p>

<p>This is a story we naturally feel drawn to and want to tell because of the multiple identities, and the sense of being an outsider. We are interested in representing characters who are not often seen in film and are regularly ignored by the mainstream. Apart from being mixed heritage and not moneyed, Eve’s alienation from Francis and his family is compounded as she recognises she has a strong attraction to women that she has tried to suppress. </p>

<p>A strong prejudice against lesbian and bisexual women within family units persists and, when featured in films, these women are often exoticised, or stereotyped. Our aim is to challenge this by eliciting the audience’s empathy for a woman who acknowledges her feelings for women, yet remains overwhelmed with anxiety and ridden with guilt over marrying her long term boyfriend. </p>

<p>Despite the absurd behaviour, actions and dialogue in EVE, the core of the drama questions a woman’s choice to explore and accept her sexual identity, saving both her husband and herself from a life of regret, suffering and deception, or bury her feelings for the sake of others.</p>

<p><strong>£12,500: Equipment.</strong> To make a good film we will need a lot of equipment such as cameras, lights, and microphones. This is one of the largest areas of the budget in any film shoot. Still, we have been awarded one camera and some elements of kit and lighting at a significantly reduced fee from the <a href=""https://generafilms.com/en/films/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Genera Film Fund</a>, and our Danish Co-Producers, <a href=""http://originals.gotfat.dk/co_productions/eve/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">GotFat Productions</a>, will be sending a gaffer to do our lighting, as well as a second camera and drone operator, with a camera and drone to support the shoot. If we exceed our budget by <strong>10%</strong> on equipment, we will be able to hire a mini Alexa  camera, which offers a truly cinematic quality to the film.

<p><strong>£1,000: Cast and Crew Expenses.</strong> One of the most amazing features of this project so far is that everybody involved has worked for free in the read-throughs and numerous auditions, with actors, crew and photographers committing time to a project we are all passionate to make. The venue has also offered us very reasonable prices to feed and provide beverages for everyone. If we manage to exceed our target by <strong>25%</strong>, we will be able to pay our cast a minimal stipend to show how much we appreciate their hours of hard work.</p>

<p><strong>£3,000: Locations, Costume and Production Design. </strong>EVE will be filmed in a beautiful mid-Victorian mansion in North London. As Francis's parents in this story are paying for the wedding, it needs to have a ""wow"" factor that shows off their wealth. We have secured incredibly cheap daily rates to shoot here with the venue offering us exterior areas, such as the gravel drive, terrace and a private walled garden, for free. The venue manager has offered us an amazing package price to shoot in this beautiful wedding locale in the peak summer period, as they are keen to support us in filming this story. However, to make our location even more sumptuous, we also need an excellent production design, which will need funding. See link to view location: <a href=""http://www.stephenshouseandgardens.com/venue-hire"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.stephenshouseandgardens.com/venue-hire</a></p>
<p>Our Costume Designer, Maybelle Laye, has just graduated from the the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and our Costume Supervisor, Rae Harrison-Doyle has extensive experience working in film and Fashion and Music videos. Our wedding dress was kindly lent to us by the Globe Theatre Costume Department.</p>

<p><strong>£5,000: Insurance, Bank Charges, Indiegogo Fee and Contingency.</strong> Insurance is very important. We want to make sure we are covered for any potential problems or challenges we may run into along the way. Indiegogo charge a 5% fee, which we need to cover, and having a contingency budget is imperative for last minute emergencies that can suddenly hit you while shooting, or in post-production, where a little additional funding might be required.</p>
<p><strong>£5,000: Post-Production.</strong> Some people say the magic happens in the editing room. It’s true! Post-Production is an essential part of making a good film. We have recruited a phenomenal Editor and Sound team, all either graduated or currently studying at the renowned National Film and Television School near London. This means a lot of the work will be able to be completed for free at NFTS studios. I want to use sound to convey the isolation of Eve, compared with the effervescent atmosphere of the wedding reception. Our sound designers will work on this element, as well as sonically distinguishing the 2 worlds of Eve and Francis. Still, we will need some costs covered, such as deliverables and hiring sound recording equipment for the shoot. These are essential costs that will ensure high-quality sound which is a prerequisite for any well-made film. </p>
<p>Colour grading, like production design, is hugely important in creating the look and feel of the film. Drawing on 1950s Americana, I'd like to emphasise the veneer and Hollywood image through the use of bright saturated colours in the colour grade with the guests at the reception, moving to darker and cooler shades of blue in encounters with Eve to reflect her disconnect in mood from the wedding bubble. Our Colourist, also a graduate from NFTS, will be working to capture this and has generously agreed to work pro bono. Please see link to an example of Sara's work: <a href=""https://vimeo.com/184375029"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/184375029</a></p>

<p><strong>£5,000: last but not least – Marketing.</strong> The most important part is getting EVE out into the world. The marketing budget would allow us to cover the cost of submitting EVE to film festivals as well as the cost of attending festivals to promote the film, buying business cards, posters, and other advertising tools to ensure EVE gets maximum exposure to audiences. We plan to submit to mainstream and LGBTQ+ festivals including BAFTA, BFI Flare, Iris Prize, Cannes, Berlin and the Oscars.</p>

<p>This film is a passion project. Our team has been recruited through recommendations, interviews, auditions and filmed readings. We feel extremely lucky to have met such a great and talented group of people, who are all committed to telling Eve's story.</p>
<p>As we have explored funding opportunities, we have sometimes come up against the challenges of having an established high profile writer, director, and cast as a barrier to financial support, yet the determination to shoot this film and tell this story will not prevent us from making it. For this reason, we are using crowdfunding to raise the budget we need. And to ensure this film is shot, we have chosen the flexible Indiegogo option and created 2 budgets: one where everyone is paid, and we have our preferred camera and lighting equipment; and a bare-bones budget where everyone works for free and we only have the most essential equipment to shoot the film. The entire team will work with either budget.</p>
<p>We are now working with a Danish film production company, <a href=""http://gotfat.dk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gotfat Productions</a>, who are equally committed to making EVE, offering us a gaffer for lighting, a second camera operator, a camera and a drone. They'll be flying from Denmark to collaborate with us. The <a href=""https://generafilms.com/en/films/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Genera Film Fund</a>, who are actively promoting our project, have also awarded us a second camera, camera lenses, and lighting equipment.</p>
<p>Our venue has actually provided us with reduced rates in the peak summer months for a large reception room/holding area for actors/equipment, which is extraordinarily generous. In addition, they have offered a private walled garden and terrace free of charge as they are an advocate for this project, supporting us wholeheartedly in making this project a reality. </p>

</div></div>","Our aim is to offer a Coming Out story that captures the audience’s imagination, eliciting surprise, empathy and humour at the absurdity and tragedy of Eve’s dilemma, supported by a host of strong characters made up of family and friends whose own reactions, prejudices and fractious encounters offer a wealth of comic and dramatic moments.   
We want to show a young bride that most women could identify with, following a well-trodden path to marriage to her long term boyfriend. Still, we plan to disorient the audience by eliciting their empathy for a woman they soon learn is lesbian, who feels paralysed as to what action to take as she confronts her long term partner with her revelation. 

We believe this LGBTQ+ slant on a runaway bride story using the genre of comedy-drama is original in concept, and can offer surprising and farcical moments that would entertain audiences through the bizarre encounters and heated exchanges between the couple and their friends and families, as well as rendering a compelling emotional drama that explores the plight of a woman now acknowledging her sexuality.
After completing this short film and taking it out to festivals, we plan to pitch it to TV Production companies and online platforms to further develop Eve's story arc into a limited TV series.
 


 
This is a story we naturally feel drawn to and want to tell because of the multiple identities, and the sense of being an outsider. We are interested in representing characters who are not often seen in film and are regularly ignored by the mainstream. Apart from being mixed heritage and not moneyed, Eve’s alienation from Francis and his family is compounded as she recognises she has a strong attraction to women that she has tried to suppress. 


A strong prejudice against lesbian and bisexual women within family units persists and, when featured in films, these women are often exoticised, or stereotyped. Our aim is to challenge this by eliciting the audience’s empathy for a woman who acknowledges her feelings for women, yet remains overwhelmed with anxiety and ridden with guilt over marrying her long term boyfriend. 

Despite the absurd behaviour, actions and dialogue in EVE, the core of the drama questions a woman’s choice to explore and accept her sexual identity, saving both her husband and herself from a life of regret, suffering and deception, or bury her feelings for the sake of others.
 

Here’s how things will go down once we meet (and exceed) our goal!



1 April–22 July 2019 | Pre-production

23–25 July 2019 | Shooting Days!

27 July–30 September 2019 | Post-production – Editing, Sound, Colour grade

October 2019–October 2020 | Festivals

To be confirmed | Premieres

In indie films (as with many other things in life), unexpected obstacles may present themselves. SO these times are subject to change. 
 



£12,500: Equipment. To make a good film we will need a lot of equipment such as cameras, lights, and microphones. This is one of the largest areas of the budget in any film shoot. Still, we have been awarded one camera and some elements of kit and lighting at a significantly reduced fee from the Genera Film Fund, and our Danish Co-Producers, GotFat Productions, will be sending a gaffer to do our lighting, as well as a second camera and drone operator, with a camera and drone to support the shoot. If we exceed our budget by 10% on equipment, we will be able to hire a mini Alexa  camera, which offers a truly cinematic quality to the film. See link to view quality: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOPjrJC3nGE
 

The production design and art direction of films like Mamma Mia, Julieta, The Square, The Kids Are Alright, L'Animale, and The End of the World, as well as artist David Hockney's blown-up, printed images of drawings of Yorkshire landscapes made on an iPad, form part of our inspiration for this. 

                                                “No copyright infringement is intended”
£1,500: Food and Beverage. We provide our cast and crew with breakfast, lunch and dinner when they are on set with us. We will be filming for 3 full days during the summer of 2019, with 30 crew and cast. We’ve got a lot of mouths to feed!


£1,000: Cast and Crew Expenses. One of the most amazing features of this project so far is that everybody involved has worked for free in the read-throughs and numerous auditions, with actors, crew and photographers committing time to a project we are all passionate to make. The venue has also offered us very reasonable prices to feed and provide beverages for everyone. If we manage to exceed our target by 25%, we will be able to pay our cast a minimal stipend to show how much we appreciate their hours of hard work.

£3,000: Locations, Costume and Production Design. EVE will be filmed in a beautiful mid-Victorian mansion in North London. As Francis's parents in this story are paying for the wedding, it needs to have a ""wow"" factor that shows off their wealth. We have secured incredibly cheap daily rates to shoot here with the venue offering us exterior areas, such as the gravel drive, terrace and a private walled garden, for free. The venue manager has offered us an amazing package price to shoot in this beautiful wedding locale in the peak summer period, as they are keen to support us in filming this story. However, to make our location even more sumptuous, we also need an excellent production design, which will need funding. See link to view location: http://www.stephenshouseandgardens.com/venue-hire
Our Costume Designer, Maybelle Laye, has just graduated from the the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and our Costume Supervisor, Rae Harrison-Doyle has extensive experience working in film and Fashion and Music videos. Our wedding dress was kindly lent to us by the Globe Theatre Costume Department.


£5,000: Insurance, Bank Charges, Indiegogo Fee and Contingency. Insurance is very important. We want to make sure we are covered for any potential problems or challenges we may run into along the way. Indiegogo charge a 5% fee, which we need to cover, and having a contingency budget is imperative for last minute emergencies that can suddenly hit you while shooting, or in post-production, where a little additional funding might be required.
£5,000: Post-Production. Some people say the magic happens in the editing room. It’s true! Post-Production is an essential part of making a good film. We have recruited a phenomenal Editor and Sound team, all either graduated or currently studying at the renowned National Film and Television School near London. This means a lot of the work will be able to be completed for free at NFTS studios. I want to use sound to convey the isolation of Eve, compared with the effervescent atmosphere of the wedding reception. Our sound designers will work on this element, as well as sonically distinguishing the 2 worlds of Eve and Francis. Still, we will need some costs covered, such as deliverables and hiring sound recording equipment for the shoot. These are essential costs that will ensure high-quality sound which is a prerequisite for any well-made film. 
Colour grading, like production design, is hugely important in creating the look and feel of the film. Drawing on 1950s Americana, I'd like to emphasise the veneer and Hollywood image through the use of bright saturated colours in the colour grade with the guests at the reception, moving to darker and cooler shades of blue in encounters with Eve to reflect her disconnect in mood from the wedding bubble. Our Colourist, also a graduate from NFTS, will be working to capture this and has generously agreed to work pro bono. Please see link to an example of Sara's work: https://vimeo.com/184375029

£5,000: last but not least – Marketing. The most important part is getting EVE out into the world. The marketing budget would allow us to cover the cost of submitting EVE to film festivals as well as the cost of attending festivals to promote the film, buying business cards, posters, and other advertising tools to ensure EVE gets maximum exposure to audiences. We plan to submit to mainstream and LGBTQ+ festivals including BAFTA, BFI Flare, Iris Prize, Cannes, Berlin and the Oscars.
 



This film is a passion project. Our team has been recruited through recommendations, interviews, auditions and filmed readings. We feel extremely lucky to have met such a great and talented group of people, who are all committed to telling Eve's story.
As we have explored funding opportunities, we have sometimes come up against the challenges of having an established high profile writer, director, and cast as a barrier to financial support, yet the determination to shoot this film and tell this story will not prevent us from making it. For this reason, we are using crowdfunding to raise the budget we need. And to ensure this film is shot, we have chosen the flexible Indiegogo option and created 2 budgets: one where everyone is paid, and we have our preferred camera and lighting equipment; and a bare-bones budget where everyone works for free and we only have the most essential equipment to shoot the film. The entire team will work with either budget.
We are now working with a Danish film production company, Gotfat Productions, who are equally committed to making EVE, offering us a gaffer for lighting, a second camera operator, a camera and a drone. They'll be flying from Denmark to collaborate with us. The Genera Film Fund, who are actively promoting our project, have also awarded us a second camera, camera lenses, and lighting equipment.
Our venue has actually provided us with reduced rates in the peak summer months for a large reception room/holding area for actors/equipment, which is extraordinarily generous. In addition, they have offered a private walled garden and terrace free of charge as they are an advocate for this project, supporting us wholeheartedly in making this project a reality. 

Regarding funding, we will only commence shooting EVE, once we have sufficient money raised to complete production of the film. 
Your pledge will help make EVE happen. You'll be a part of making a film – you'll be able to see the filmmaking process through our updates; from prep to shoot to post-production.
We have several different Rewards available in return for your contribution, including digital photo albums from the film, a digital copy of the script, tote bags, DVDs, invitations to the premiere, the chance to be in the film and to become a member of the production team.

<h3>Overview</h3>

The film sets out the explore the meaning of life and death, and the existential crisis of adulthood in a lyrical but relatable way.

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Matina is facing pivotal life issues: the end of her marriage, a career that no longer makes her happy, a midlife crisis. She’s also tasked with having to clear out her long-gone mother’s things from the family summer house. After she arrives at the house she begins to unravel, as past and present collide, until she reaches a personal epiphany.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why This Film</h3>
<p>There are moments in life that we all at some point go through, losing a loved one, growing older, being alone again. In this story, I’m interested in exploring the space between closing one life chapter before opening a new one. There are moments of loneliness and reflection that occupy that gap where we have the opportunity to reconnect with our essence. This film is an invitation to take a moment and reflect on moments like these and connect with a story that aims to give you a sense of belonging. </p>

<p>Julia started her musical career as a Jazz musician, from an early stage focusing on original compositions and arrangements. She combines her Brazilian heritage with her European education. Writing mostly from script Julia’s film scores help shape characters and places, not telling the audience what to think, but revealing who they are. Intertwined with the story her music betrays empathy towards the characters and their surroundings, writing from within them, in and around their nature, expressing an unobserved face that is not seen and can only be felt. <a href=""http://www.julia-lima.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.julia-lima.com</a></p>

<h3>Mental States: The Anthology</h3>
<p><i>Dust Light</i> is part of a bigger project and it’s the first film of the <i>Mental States</i> anthology to go into production.<i> Mental States</i> is an anthology of three short films exploring the beauty and pain of being human. The ideas for the three films were born out of the need to be more creative, bouts of existential crisis, and considering how the modern world affects our mental state. Therefore, their themes are anchored in existentialism, mental health issues and the link between thought and emotion - bringing the inward outward and the outward inward. The two other shorts that complete the anthology, <i>The Lump In Her Throat, </i>a lyrical tale about depression, and  <i>Bugs In Amber</i>,  an existential relationship drama, will be produced later in 2020. Chryssanthi is the writer and director of all three films. </p>

Dust Light is a simple but layered story that reflects the complexity of life, inside and out. The film sets out the explore the meaning of life and death, and the existential crisis of adulthood in a lyrical but relatable way. Through the themes of loss, grief and solitude the protagonist embarks on an intimate journey, looking for the pieces of herself that she lost along the way, and carries us away with her in a quietly exhilarating ride.

The Story
Matina is facing pivotal life issues: the end of her marriage, a career that no longer makes her happy, a midlife crisis. She’s also tasked with having to clear out her long-gone mother’s things from the family summer house. After she arrives at the house she begins to unravel, as past and present collide, until she reaches a personal epiphany.

Why This Film
There are moments in life that we all at some point go through, losing a loved one, growing older, being alone again. In this story, I’m interested in exploring the space between closing one life chapter before opening a new one. There are moments of loneliness and reflection that occupy that gap where we have the opportunity to reconnect with our essence. This film is an invitation to take a moment and reflect on moments like these and connect with a story that aims to give you a sense of belonging.

<p><strong>The Basics</strong></p>
<p>Stateless Productions (Stateless) is requesting funding for its second documentary, “America’s Police Crisis.”  As we witnessed the recent protests of the injustices perpetrated by police against American Citizens, we realized this was a subject that needed a deeper exploration than the superficial responses being offered.  This film will explore the short history of the police force in America and how it has progressed to its current state in an effort to find solutions to the abuses that affect many in this country. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am Chris Cofer, the film’s Director and Producer.  My partners, Peter R. Quinones (host of Free Man Beyond the Wall podcast) and Robert Beeler, as well as an entire support team, have been developing this new documentary since completing our first documentary, “The Monopoly on Violence” in June 2020.  We want to make a film that sparks a national dialogue about what is wrong with the way police operate in this country and how the systematic abuses have become increasingly prevalent.  If we can convey the problem and potential solutions in a meaningful and engaging way, not only will we make more people aware of this problem, we may help prevent further police abuse, as well as the riots and violence that follow those abuses. And we are just the team to explore this difficult issue.  We are dedicated to finding and sharing the truth.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>The budget for this documentary is $60,000.  While this may seem high, in the world of film production it is a reasonable cost for a feature length documentary.  As independent filmmakers, we've learned to make every dollar count. We know the importance of investing in the right tools, the right crew members, and the right strategies in order to remain within budget while making successful films. By participating in the production of this film, you will receive the satisfaction of being part of a truly meaningful documentary as well as being able to tell friends you had an integral part in making movies that are seen worldwide. When you review the perks of funding this project, you'll see you will earn even more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>This film is intended to bring awareness to those who do not understand the concerns of individuals who believe the police force in America has too much power, too little accountability, and does not provide the expected security services to those that pay them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Stateless’ first project, the documentary, “The Monopoly on Violence,” almost doubled its goal in Crowdfund and we continue to receive accolades from donors and audiences stating they loved our work.  The film is currently streaming on Amazon and receiving 5-star ratings.  It has also received high ratings on the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), with some of those ratings more positive than many studio produced films.  We make films about ideas ignored by many and succeed in spreading those ideas to a broader audience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This film deals with a less obscure subject matter than “The Monopoly on Violence,” which is why we believe a larger audience will be able to relate to it.  We've all seen corporate media-produced videos that are sensationalized and lacking nuance. We've seen how Hollywood mythologizes law enforcement in our culture. We intend to tell the full story without pulling punches.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Making a film is not without risks. These risks can include falling short of funding goals and being forced to create with less resources, or creating a film that does not connect with audiences in the way we anticipated. To reduce the risk of running over budget, we have taken the lessons learned in producing ""The Monopoly on Violence"" and retooled our approach to production. A professional Director of Photography has been hired in order to achieve the best shot each time, thereby reducing the need for multiple shots and/or reshoots. Instead of spending money on plane tickets and hotels, we are scheduling interviews within days of each other and traveling by RV to maximize efficiency and stay within budget. We've budgeted additional money for marketing to attract a larger audience.  We have also hired a crew. The last film was a labor of love assembled by people who were just happy to make a film about a subject they were passionate about to share with others. This time, we are using paid professionals.</p>

<p>Reejekt Productions was born just a few short weeks ago after we finished filming our first short film and we decided we love what we do and thought, why not?  We are small and family run production company.  Kianna Grace, Director &amp; Producer of our first short is usually on the other side of the camera as an actor and has a wealth of experience in film and theatre.  Owen Evans, Grip &amp; Runner of our first short has some extra experience and is very keen to learn.  Me, I was ‘officially’ Executive Producer and basically was Mum to everyone on set.</p>
<p>Everyone has experienced grief at some time of their life, be it a parent, a friend or a treasured pet.  Grief can hit hard and at unexpected times, it eases, but never truly leaves us.   </p>
<p>Halloween is a poignant story that centres around how children within the same family cope with grief very differently, and how coping with their own grief and that of their children weighs heavily on the parent left behind. </p>
<p>Your contribution will help us to bring this haunting tale of a young girl missing her Mum on one of her favourite days of the year to life.  It would help us pay for locations, crew, equipment… even food for our actors on set.</p>
<p>We are hoping to raise £1,500</p>
<p>We would like to offer donations to the people that have offered us their premises as locations for our shoot, one of which is a small locally based charity.</p>
<p>We would like to pay our crew and offer an honorarium payment to our actors.</p>
<p>We gained a lot of experience from a first film and will need to hire some additional equipment for this one</p>
<p>We would like to at least be able to pay to replace the make-up used by our MUA’s</p>
<p>We also need to feed everyone and provide drinks and snacks</p>
<p>We understand that not everyone is able to make a financial contribution, but any help you can give would be greatly appreciated.  Perhaps you are able to share on your social media?  Perhaps you can spread the word for us in a different way? Help us to promote the film and the campaign? Do you have film experience, maybe you could help us as crew?</p>
<p>Thank you :)</p>
</div></div>","Reejekt Productions was born just a few short weeks ago after we finished filming our first short film and we decided we love what we do and thought, why not?  We are small and family run production company.  Kianna Grace, Director & Producer of our first short is usually on the other side of the camera as an actor and has a wealth of experience in film and theatre.  Owen Evans, Grip & Runner of our first short has some extra experience and is very keen to learn.  Me, I was ‘officially’ Executive Producer and basically was Mum to everyone on set.
Everyone has experienced grief at some time of their life, be it a parent, a friend or a treasured pet.  Grief can hit hard and at unexpected times, it eases, but never truly leaves us.   
Halloween is a poignant story that centres around how children within the same family cope with grief very differently, and how coping with their own grief and that of their children weighs heavily on the parent left behind. 
Your contribution will help us to bring this haunting tale of a young girl missing her Mum on one of her favourite days of the year to life.  It would help us pay for locations, crew, equipment… even food for our actors on set.
We are hoping to raise £1,500
We would like to offer donations to the people that have offered us their premises as locations for our shoot, one of which is a small locally based charity.
We would like to pay our crew and offer an honorarium payment to our actors.
We gained a lot of experience from a first film and will need to hire some additional equipment for this one
We would like to at least be able to pay to replace the make-up used by our MUA’s
We also need to feed everyone and provide drinks and snacks
We understand that not everyone is able to make a financial contribution, but any help you can give would be greatly appreciated.  Perhaps you are able to share on your social media?  Perhaps you can spread the word for us in a different way? Help us to promote the film and the campaign? Do you have film experience, maybe you could help us as crew?
Thank you :)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Film</h3>
<p><i>Death in a Diner</i>  follows the story of Sarah, a young woman working at her mom’s old diner, and Death, a frequent customer. When Death comes into the diner on the eve of Sarah’s 24th birthday, they both look back and consider where they are in life as they ponder the question: “Would you be happy with your life if you died tonight?”</p>
<h3>Meet the Crew!</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Meghan AmRhein and I am the Writer/Director of <i>Death in a Diner</i>.  As a Junior in the Montana State University Film Program, I am excited to be directing my first short film. This script is all about remembering to live life the way you want to and not the way someone else wants you to live it. Especially now, since COVID-19 has disrupted so many aspects of our lives, it’s important to remember not to be scared of living and to remember that life is a fickle, fickle thing.</p>
<p>We have a talented group of juniors leading this project. Our producer is Ashley Moore, our Director of Photography is Sam Pfeiffer, and our Gaffer is Jasper Poore. Along with that, we have a talented group of students who will be helping us bring this project to life.</p>
<p>However, we cannot do that without your help!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>Funding is vital to any film, and as a student film we work on a very small production budget. Thanks to the generosity of the School of Film and Photography Checkout Team, all of our equipment expenses are covered. As a result, our biggest and most important expense is food so that we can provide meals, snacks, and drinks to all of our cast and crew members. Here is an inside look at some of our estimated expenses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Food: $700</li>
<li>Costumes/Set Design: $300</li>
<li>COVID-19 Supplies: $50</li>
<li>Location Costs: $100</li>
<li>Miscellaneous Equipment: $100</li>
<li>Cast: $100</li>
<li>Post-Production: $70</li>
<li>Film Festivals: $100</li>
<li>Wiggle-Room Expenses (i.e. transportation, production office supplies, campaign fees, and any other unforeseen circumstances): $480 </li>
</ul>
<p>Be sure to check out our unique perks for donating!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contributions will help a group of young, student filmmakers gain more experience in the work force as they prepare to enter the film industry.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest risk our production faces is COVID-19. To ensure every member on our set is kept safe, here are some of the precautions we will be taking:</p>
<ul>
<li>A COVID Compliance Officer will be present on set at all times.</li>
<li>Temperatures will be checked three times a day.</li>
<li>Masks will be worn at all times. Actors will be allowed to un-mask when cameras are rolling, but will re-mask in between takes.</li>
<li>Hand sanitizer and sanitation wipes will be available on set to keep our hands and surfaces clean.</li>
<li>We will follow CDC guidelines and the standards that are being used in the professional film industry.</li>

a special prologue that focuses on the mysterious demon
hunter himself, Mac, starring David Lee McInnis.   Instead of explaining this ourselves, we thought it would be better if Mac personally introduced himself to you:<br/></sub></p><sub><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dctt_K7oIgqQ&amp;src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fctt_K7oIgqQ&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><i><b><br/></b></i></sub><h2><sub><b><b>THE TEAM</b></b></sub></h2><sub>But why should you put your trust in us?  We are filmmakers

immediate goal is to raise enough money to make three 10 minute

a twist!  Does this sound like something you’d
watch?Then help us bring you the stuff that late night thriller anthologies are made of.  We’re talking about The Hunter’s Anthology, an exciting new web series we want
to make for you, the fans!  Please join us and help make it happen.
Here’s what it’s all about: Six strangers find themselves
trapped in a New York City subway with Mac, a mysterious man who claims to be a
demon hunter.  Insisting one of them is a demon, he peeks into their
souls to solve the mystery, discovering five eerie, supernatural tales.
Sound
cool?  We think so, and we want to share
it with you!  The Hunter’s Anthology is for
everyone, especially fans of thriller, horror, mystery, and short stories with
twisty endings.  It's a mix between the Twilight Zone
and Tales from the Crypt: fun, creepy, entertaining, unpredictable
short stories you’d watch late with the lights down on a Saturday night!THE PROLOGUEThe tales in The Hunter's Anthology are very different, each with a twist on a very familiar supernatural theme.  And the running, wraparound mystery of trying to figure out who the demon is will keep you guessing throughout.  We’ve already shot
a special prologue that focuses on the mysterious demon
hunter himself, Mac, starring David Lee McInnis.   Instead of explaining this ourselves, we thought it would be better if Mac personally introduced himself to you:THE TEAMBut why should you put your trust in us?  We are filmmakers 
who have vast experience in the industry.  We have connections to a 
great, talented cast and crew, many of whom are already on board.  We 
have a script that is strong.  You won't be disappointed.  Meet our 
filmmakers:Robert Smithline (Writer/Director)Robert
Smithline wrote and directed “Escape from the Night” (Short Film Winner at
the Telluride Indiefest) and “Get the Hell Out of Heaven.”  He most recently directed the short
film version of “Trust Us,” his award winning play, which is now in development
to be a full feature.  His
experience touches upon almost 15 years of experience in all phases of filmmaking
from writing to directing to editing.Arezu ""Nicky"" Akmal (Producer)Producer Arezu ""Nicky"" Akmal is an award-winning producer who has produced and line produced over 30 films to date, including ""August the First"" (which traveled to over 25 International Film Festivals, winning several awards, and was nominated for a 2007 IFP Gotham Award.)  Her other notable works include: HBO's ""A Shot in the Dark,"" a documentary about Adrian Grenier's (Entourage) search for his father, and ""The Understudy,"" starring Richard Kind, Assif Mandvi, Kelli Giddish, and Marin Ireland.  She is a member of the Prodcuers Guild of America.THE WEB SERIES/FEATURE FILMEp. 1: The Demon Hunter Part 1 - A mysterious man traps six people on the subway with the knowledge that one of them is a demon.Ep. 2 & 3: The Fortune Maker - A woman knocks on a fortune teller's door after hours in desperate need of a Tarot reading.Ep. 4 & 5: Channel 14 - When newlyweds discover that channel 14 broadcasts the surveillance camera outside their new apartment, they can see a creepy creature lurks out there, trying to break inside.Ep. 6 & 7: A Visit to the Asylum - A young man visiting his grandmother at an asylum gets the shock of his life.Ep. 8 & 9: You Can't Unwish a Wish - Conjoined twins, bullied at school, come across an ancient coin that grants them three wishes.Ep. 10 & 11: Lust Potion Number Who Cares - A man falls for his co-worker and learns of an exclusive, secret magic potion shop that might just carry the love potion he needs.Ep. 12: The Demon Hunter Part 2 - Now with all the information he needs about his captives, Mac must reveal and destroy the demon amongst him.

With
the success of anthology shows like American
Horror Story and the soon to return Tales from the Darkside, the supernatural anthology series is
making a comeback.  This is something
people want to see.  We’re fans too, so we're going to do this right and give the anthology series format the treatment it deserves, and we're passionate about sharing it with you!THE BUDGETAs you probably know, filmmaking isn't cheap.  We have to pay for equipment, sets, crew, locations, cast, and yes, even food for everyone.  It all adds up.  So now we're looking to you to help us raise enough money to at least get us up and running.  Here's a breakdown of our budget:Our
immediate goal is to raise enough money to make three 10 minute
episodes, but if we exceed our goal, more episodes can be added until all 12
episodes are funded (a budget of $200,000 or more.)  Also The Hunter's Anthology is written as a full-length feature film, so if we raise enough, that's exactly what it can be.
THE PERKSWe have great perks to choose from: a shout out on social media and exclusive email updates, DVDs of the series with behind the scenes extras, a chance to win a prop from set, be in the credits, visit the  set, or even be IN the movie.  Some of you might just find
yourself decked out in special effects makeup, but I’ll stop there.  We don’t
want to give it away!

Rob was eager to write the screenplay, incorporating aspects of the movies I love such as <i>Friday the 13th</i> and <i>Sleepaway Camp</i>.  However, our protagonists are complex, relatable

in Monticello, Indiana for the two weeks of filming in September.  The camp will not only be our shooting location, but will also be where all cast and crew will be calling home for the entire shoot.

is threatened with permanent closure after a series of unfortunate events.  However, they find out the camp might be best left closed.Actor/writer Rob Mello (Happy Death Day, The Magnificent Seven) has teamed with producer/director/actor Rebecca Rinehart (The Embalmers, CarousHELL the 2nd) on a brand new slasher film that takes fear back to the woods.  Their upcoming camp slasherTin Roof will begin filming in Monticello, Indiana in September of 2021.Rob and Rebecca location scouting in Monticello, IndianaSpecial FX Master Joe Castro (Terror Toons, Exorcism at 60,000 Feet, Blood Feast 2) will bring his skills to the project designing some of the most brutal kill-scenes ever seen on film.Joe creating a creature for Todd Sheets' Bonehill Road.Joining the team as the Director of Photography is Laura Duval (The Marked).  Laura received an MBA in Film Production from the University of New Orleans and is now a producer/director at Tiny Pup Productions.Laura is currently working on John Schneider's latest film, Poker Run.Of the project, Rinehart says: “After directing The Embalmers, I wanted to make a film in the subgenre that is my true passion: camp slashers. Rob was eager to write the screenplay, incorporating aspects of the movies I love such as Friday the 13th and Sleepaway Camp.  However, our protagonists are complex, relatable middle-aged people as opposed to one-dimensional teen caricatures that are seen in so many modern slashers.”FUNDRAISINGWe are trying a different approach to financing for Tin Roof.  We will be using this IGG to raise money for particular aspects of the budget with perks that cater to interests of the backers.  We are starting by raising the $4500 to rent Camp Buffalo in Monticello, Indiana for the two weeks of filming in September.  The camp will not only be our shooting location, but will also be where all cast and crew will be calling home for the entire shoot.   In this tier of fundraising, we will offer only one perk: a chance to be an Executive Producer and interact with our cast and crew on set for a day AND stay the night at wonderful Camp Buffalo.  NOTE:  this will be the ONLY opportunity for EP credit and is limited to 6 spots.Camp Buffalo is an operating Boy Scout camp in Northern Indiana.As we add goals, the perks will be changing, so if this isn't the perk for you, stay tuned!!!  We will have other fundraising goals based around special effects, cast, food, travel, and post-production.OUR  CASTAlso featuring local Indiana talent Rebekah Erb (Idle Girl), Joshua Scantland (Judas and the Black Mesiah), Michael Taylor (The Embalmers), Makenna Rhode (Vampire Santa), Raymond Kester (Pitfire of Hell), and Joey Jessup (Purgatorio), PRESS COVERAGE:Monticello Herald: https://www.newsbug.info/monticello_herald_jour...iHorror: https://www.ihorror.com/rob-mello-rebecca-rineh...PopHorror: https://www.pophorror.com/summer-camp-horror-ti...Vocal Media: https://vocal.media/horror/rebecca-rinehartDarkmovies: https://darkmovies.be/lhorreur-au-camp-dete-rev...Cinema Blend:  https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2560476/what-t...Horror Fix:  https://www.horror-fix.com/tiiiiiin-roof-bloody...Tennesee Horror: https://tnhorror.com/tag/tin-roof/ Follow us on Facebook or email us at tinroofmovie@gmail.com for information or other investment opportunities.",12.0,0,"9 Campaigns

<p><strong>Update: 9/16/21 </strong></p>
<p>Thank you for your support! <strong>Our campaign remains open ""in demand"" for funds to help us with post-production.  </strong>We appreciate you being on this journey with us. We love you x three!</p>
<p><strong>Update: 8/10/21 - EXCITING NEWS! </strong><i>Birds, Bees, and Threes</i> has hit it's initial goal for pre-production and production in just 2 weeks!! Our entire team is blown away by the support we've received. Any additional funds received during this campaign will go towards post-production costs. (Editing, coloring, festival submission, etc). Thank you for helping us get across the post-production finish line too! </p>
<h3><strong>Story</strong></h3>
<p>Artist Statement from Paige Hullett:</p>
<p>Hi there! My name is Paige Hullett, an LA based actress and writer.<i> BIRDS, BEES AND THREES</i> is a short film based on a true story from my childhood growing up as a triplet in the conservative midwest. In the summer of 2019, my writing partner, Gunnar, and I road tripped from Atlanta to Los Angeles. During our time in the car, we were inspired to write this short as our first project together.</p>
<p><i>BIRDS, BEES, AND THREES</i> is a personal project. It centers around a key moment from my childhood, is filled with humorous and painfully awkward moments, and most importantly, it highlights the need for proper sex education &amp; the different reactions children can have when they find out about sex.</p>
<p><i>Logline: </i>After a member of Julia's triplet support group is unexpectedly forced to explain sex to her kids, the trusted group leader expresses the importance of teaching children about sex by age eight. <i>BIRDS, BEES, AND THREES</i> comically follows JULIA and ANDY HUDSON and their triplet daughters as they have vastly different reactions to the news and attempt to digest their embarrassment, shock and confusion.</p>
<p>​Thank you for helping us bring our story to life! </p>
<h3>TONE</h3>
<p>The tone of the short is funny and unapologetically real. The visual style will be bright and colorful, reflecting the conservative ideals of the classic Midwest family, and the concept of The American Dream (ie: white picket fence, the whole shabang). The triplet support group will feel like we are at an AA meeting.</p>
<p>The cinematography will be fast paced, but allow the audience time to linger and feel the cringey moments, making them feel like they are part of the conversation.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $13,500, which will cover pre-production and production costs. We will have a separate campaign that focuses on post-production, and distribution. If we raise over our goal, funds will go towards post. Our hope is to have this film screen at various festivals, but more importantly, educate new parents with screenings at local schools, hospitals and theaters. If we do not raise all of our funds during this campaign, we will push back our shoot date until we do. We are confident we are going to make this short film come to life. </p>
<p>The following is a breakdown of our budget. When making an independent production, every bit helps! We would be grateful if you would consider donating to our project, and to show our appreciation, we have an array of perks that you can choose from! Every tier of perks will also include the tier before it. </p>

</div></div>","Update: 9/16/21 
Thank you for your support! Our campaign remains open ""in demand"" for funds to help us with post-production.  We appreciate you being on this journey with us. We love you x three!
Update: 8/10/21 - EXCITING NEWS! Birds, Bees, and Threes has hit it's initial goal for pre-production and production in just 2 weeks!! Our entire team is blown away by the support we've received. Any additional funds received during this campaign will go towards post-production costs. (Editing, coloring, festival submission, etc). Thank you for helping us get across the post-production finish line too! 
Story
Artist Statement from Paige Hullett:
Hi there! My name is Paige Hullett, an LA based actress and writer. BIRDS, BEES AND THREES is a short film based on a true story from my childhood growing up as a triplet in the conservative midwest. In the summer of 2019, my writing partner, Gunnar, and I road tripped from Atlanta to Los Angeles. During our time in the car, we were inspired to write this short as our first project together.
BIRDS, BEES, AND THREES is a personal project. It centers around a key moment from my childhood, is filled with humorous and painfully awkward moments, and most importantly, it highlights the need for proper sex education & the different reactions children can have when they find out about sex.
Logline: After a member of Julia's triplet support group is unexpectedly forced to explain sex to her kids, the trusted group leader expresses the importance of teaching children about sex by age eight. BIRDS, BEES, AND THREES comically follows JULIA and ANDY HUDSON and their triplet daughters as they have vastly different reactions to the news and attempt to digest their embarrassment, shock and confusion.
​Thank you for helping us bring our story to life! 
TONE
The tone of the short is funny and unapologetically real. The visual style will be bright and colorful, reflecting the conservative ideals of the classic Midwest family, and the concept of The American Dream (ie: white picket fence, the whole shabang). The triplet support group will feel like we are at an AA meeting.
The cinematography will be fast paced, but allow the audience time to linger and feel the cringey moments, making them feel like they are part of the conversation.

What We Need & What You Get
Our goal is to raise $13,500, which will cover pre-production and production costs. We will have a separate campaign that focuses on post-production, and distribution. If we raise over our goal, funds will go towards post. Our hope is to have this film screen at various festivals, but more importantly, educate new parents with screenings at local schools, hospitals and theaters. If we do not raise all of our funds during this campaign, we will push back our shoot date until we do. We are confident we are going to make this short film come to life. 
The following is a breakdown of our budget. When making an independent production, every bit helps! We would be grateful if you would consider donating to our project, and to show our appreciation, we have an array of perks that you can choose from! Every tier of perks will also include the tier before it. 


Other Ways You Can Help
Can't donate the minimum perk amount? No matter! You can donate as little as $1. If that's even hard to come by, there's still hope! You can follow us on IG @birdsbeesandthreesfilm, and share this page on your social media sites. Tweet it, Share it, Talk about it!

<h3>THE REAL LIFE STORY OF A VICTIM OF BULLYING...WITH SOME TWISTS</h3>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">  FILMMAKER WILLIAM LEE'S LATEST ACTION FILM HAS A REAL LIFE ORIGIN...</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Billy Blackwolf (William Lee) is a government agent haunted by the trauma of physical abuse during his school years. When he is assigned to take down a group of international criminals, his assignment becomes vengeance when he discovers his targets are all of his high school bullies. Karma isn't a bitch, it's a wolf.</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>William Lee, an independent film director for three decades,  has known how difficult it is to make a film with little financial backing and huge amounts of unwelcome advice. His passion for what he does has kept him moving forward in the face of staggering challenges.<br/><br/>After seeing Kung Fu legend, and martial arts movie legend Bruce Lee on screen for the first time in 1974, Lee asked his father to purchase a movie camera so that he might replicate the famous martial artists' exploits--albeit on a smaller scale. Within a year of picking up a movie camera, Lee received his first film award at the Eye Music Festival of San Francisco. Since then, he has directed over 30 film projects.<br/><br/>Until his first major release <strong>Code: Black</strong>, in 2007, Lee had been virtually unknown. His films languished in obscure film fests, Midwestern film premieres, and on-line sites like Indieflix.com.</li>
<li>Never quirky enough to interest Sundance, too action-filled to be praised in major ""refined"" film circles, never peopled by major or even sub-major stars, financed totally from Lee's various day jobs, he has spent every year since 1974 chasing that dream. The dream that one day he could be seen for what he is. Not a black filmmaker, but a filmmaker who makes non-stereotypical, well-written action films with a message. Nothing more, nothing less.</li>
<li>William has had three films sold to <strong>Redbox</strong> in the last three years. His film <strong>SIX FEET BELOW HELL </strong>has been at <strong>Redbox</strong> for 3 years.</li>
<li>In 2020, more than ten of his films will be released on DVD through <strong>Bayview entertainment</strong>.</li>
<li><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1577905960/enbrxx2wjmbivhh8rhsj.jpg"" src=""""/></li>

<p> </p>

<li>Later this year, his horror film <strong>THE GOOCHER will be released on DVD AND ITUNES.</strong>

<li> </li>
<li><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>BLACK WOLF already has TWO DISTRIBUTION OFFERS IN PLACE</strong></h2></li>
<li>Some notes from William Lee about<strong> BLACK WOLF</strong>: ""My experience with bullying came at a time when there was no social media. Thus, the bullying  I received was experienced upfront and personal. I was abused, harassed, sexually intimidated, Bullies even purposely injured me on the sports field, just to get at me. My bullies were people who wanted to physically and mentally demean me. My salvation was self-determination, and discovery of the martial arts, Asian philosophy,  and Bruce Lee.""</li>
<li>""I have never made a film this personal. While it goes off into fictional events, the core of the story is my real life. Hateful incidents I experienced, at the hands of people I thought would support me. <strong>Being told I WAS NOT BLACK ENOUGH, and being cast off as some kind of traitor to the black race is an experience that has left an indelible mark on my life. </strong>There were times I felt alone in this world, yet I somehow overcame the hate I was being given and made it out of that hell.""</li>
<li>""In a perfect world, things like this-extreme bullying- should not happen. The real world is far from perfect. Today's generation is experiencing bullying on a  different platform. Online bullying is a world of threats and bold stances by people who are for the most part, cowards. It's mind games. <strong>Now imagine that instead of some anonymous bastard posting stupid things about you online, you're now face to face with your tormentors beating your ass, every day, all day.  Degrading your humanity, poisoning the minds of your friends and acquaintances, basically making you a leper, a pariah. </strong>Someone less than human. I WENT THROUGH THAT.  And you know what? You can't delete a thug punching you in the face. You have to fight back. Or lose.""</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul><li>$3000 will cover the support my cast and crew need to make the film. Food, help with some travel expenses, props, and makeup. It will not cover everything, but that is to be expected.

</div></div>","THE REAL LIFE STORY OF A VICTIM OF BULLYING...WITH SOME TWISTS
  FILMMAKER WILLIAM LEE'S LATEST ACTION FILM HAS A REAL LIFE ORIGIN...
 
Billy Blackwolf (William Lee) is a government agent haunted by the trauma of physical abuse during his school years. When he is assigned to take down a group of international criminals, his assignment becomes vengeance when he discovers his targets are all of his high school bullies. Karma isn't a bitch, it's a wolf.

William Lee, an independent film director for three decades,  has known how difficult it is to make a film with little financial backing and huge amounts of unwelcome advice. His passion for what he does has kept him moving forward in the face of staggering challenges.After seeing Kung Fu legend, and martial arts movie legend Bruce Lee on screen for the first time in 1974, Lee asked his father to purchase a movie camera so that he might replicate the famous martial artists' exploits--albeit on a smaller scale. Within a year of picking up a movie camera, Lee received his first film award at the Eye Music Festival of San Francisco. Since then, he has directed over 30 film projects.Until his first major release Code: Black, in 2007, Lee had been virtually unknown. His films languished in obscure film fests, Midwestern film premieres, and on-line sites like Indieflix.com.
Never quirky enough to interest Sundance, too action-filled to be praised in major ""refined"" film circles, never peopled by major or even sub-major stars, financed totally from Lee's various day jobs, he has spent every year since 1974 chasing that dream. The dream that one day he could be seen for what he is. Not a black filmmaker, but a filmmaker who makes non-stereotypical, well-written action films with a message. Nothing more, nothing less.
William has had three films sold to Redbox in the last three years. His film SIX FEET BELOW HELL has been at Redbox for 3 years.
In 2020, more than ten of his films will be released on DVD through Bayview entertainment.





 

Later this year, his horror film THE GOOCHER will be released on DVD AND ITUNES.


 
BLACK WOLF already has TWO DISTRIBUTION OFFERS IN PLACE
Some notes from William Lee about BLACK WOLF: ""My experience with bullying came at a time when there was no social media. Thus, the bullying  I received was experienced upfront and personal. I was abused, harassed, sexually intimidated, Bullies even purposely injured me on the sports field, just to get at me. My bullies were people who wanted to physically and mentally demean me. My salvation was self-determination, and discovery of the martial arts, Asian philosophy,  and Bruce Lee.""
""I have never made a film this personal. While it goes off into fictional events, the core of the story is my real life. Hateful incidents I experienced, at the hands of people I thought would support me. Being told I WAS NOT BLACK ENOUGH, and being cast off as some kind of traitor to the black race is an experience that has left an indelible mark on my life. There were times I felt alone in this world, yet I somehow overcame the hate I was being given and made it out of that hell.""
""In a perfect world, things like this-extreme bullying- should not happen. The real world is far from perfect. Today's generation is experiencing bullying on a  different platform. Online bullying is a world of threats and bold stances by people who are for the most part, cowards. It's mind games. Now imagine that instead of some anonymous bastard posting stupid things about you online, you're now face to face with your tormentors beating your ass, every day, all day.  Degrading your humanity, poisoning the minds of your friends and acquaintances, basically making you a leper, a pariah. Someone less than human. I WENT THROUGH THAT.  And you know what? You can't delete a thug punching you in the face. You have to fight back. Or lose.""


What We Need & What You Get
$3000 will cover the support my cast and crew need to make the film. Food, help with some travel expenses, props, and makeup. It will not cover everything, but that is to be expected. I never expect too much money to come from crowdfunding because times are hard and people don't have lots of cash sitting around for artistic endeavors.  On past films, we've had support from Redbox or investors. This is not the case. Whatever you don't give, I'll cover. And I'll gladly do it to make this film.

THE LAKEFRONT TEAM HAS A SHORT HORROR/THRILLER, THE NEST, THAT HAS RECEIVED AWARDS AND RECOGNITIONS AT MANY FILM FESTIVALS, AND HAS BEEN MOST  RECENTLY RECOGNIZED BY NBC CHICAGO FIRE IN WHICH CHICAGO FIRE LICENSED OUR FOOTAGE FOR THEIR SHOW.AND AN ADDITIONAL BONUS TO YOU - The Unseen has recently obtained fiscal sponsorship status from FROM THE HEART PRODUCTIONS, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization helping indie filmmakers bring their art to life. Due to its non-profit status, any donations made to The Unseen through From The Heart Productions (link here) can be considered tax-deductible charitable contributions.

With our skills, we believe we can still bring a high level of terror and production value, although with your help, we believe we can reach this goal.RISKS AND CHALLENGESWe wouldn’t be honest if we didn’t say there are risks in filmmaking and in investing in a film. Filmmaking is a complicated and difficult process, with obstacles both seen and unseen that can arise at any time, and often films get started but never finish.However, myself and our team not only have a proven track record of success in completing complex, professional film projects, we also share the same drive to overcome those who say “No you can’t.” I am driven to finish this project and share it with the world, and I am asking you to help.And, more importantly, it is well known in the film industry that the horror genre is the most lucrative sought after genre - with our team and your help, we can almost guarantee that this project will be incredibly successful and become well known. So this is a chance to get in on what we know will amount to an incredibly successful and popular film.OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELPCan’t contribute but still want to help bring this film to life?

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We have raised the necessary funds to get things started and now we need your help to raise another £16k to make the full feature. This money will make such a big difference to our production. We will invest it into more shoot days, with every extra day we have, the more time we have to get the right shots and the right performances. Horror movies rely so much on the visuals and the atmosphere and buying ourselves more time buys us more quality which means more enjoyment for you as the audience. We will also invest more in visual effects. We believe in the less is more approach but when you do actually see something, the pay off has to be worthy of the build up. Like the  shark in Jaws or the alien in Alien.</li>
<li>We really believe this is a community project, not just the local community but the horror community who are so passionate and enthusiastic about the genre. We have some really exciting perks which range from special merchandise to  interacting with cast and crew and actually being involved in production.</li>
<li>If we don't reach the total required funds, we will still go ahead and make this movie, there is too much passion and determination in our team to not get it over the line. Of course the more we get in the budget, the more we can improve on our special effects and improve the visual storytelling. It takes a lot of money to make a movie happen and with each donation we are a little closer to the high-quality polished finish of a Hollywood movie.</li>

<h3>The Team Behind The Teaser....</h3>
<p>We had a very talented and enthusiastic team for the filming of our Wolf Garden teaser. As it was shot in one day it required a lot of planning beforehand to get so many shots and make everything run smoothly. With <strong>Wayne David</strong> directing/producing, we had the extremely talented director of photography <strong>Ariel Artur</strong> with his excellent camera team of <strong>Steve Fairman</strong> and <strong>Rob Shannon</strong>. Setting the right tone and mood for each of the scenes whilst trying to keep a narrative was so important in making this work. Our 1st assistant director was the ever-enthusiastic <strong>Linzy Attenborough </strong>helped on the day by the hard work of production manager <strong>Wenqian Sun</strong>. Working sound we had the great <strong>Geoff Pheasant</strong> and our fantastic makeup artist was <strong>Rebecca Wheeler</strong> working very hard to make our creature look the business with the brilliant prosthetics made by <strong>David Foxley</strong> at <strong>Fox Zumbi Dark Arts FX</strong>. And last but not least the fine editing of <strong>Fabrizio Gammardella</strong> who shaped all that effort into what you've just watched.</p>
<p>Special thanks also has to go to our talented cast of actors, <strong>Rosina Williams, Nick David, Hazel Halliday</strong> and <strong>Wayne David </strong>(that guy again!).</p>
<p>It was through the work and dedication of all involved that we managed to make this teaser happen and get it to the level we wanted it at to bring to you now.</p>

<div>Originally from Ohio, I have been living and working in Harlem as an independent filmmaker since 2009. Along with co-owner (and ""Anthology"" star) Ricki Lynée, I run a small production company called <a href=""http://www.nuanseentertainment.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nuanse Entertainment</a>. </div><div>
<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436753814/v3gmiupy6dvxrchp5plm.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div><br/></div><div>The goal of our company is to create and distribute projects that depict multi-dimensional characters across every genre. Over the last few years, Nuanse has produced films, comedy sketches and music videos that have screened at festivals and showcases across the country. </div><div><br/></div>
<div>Our latest project, <b>Anthology</b>, follows six 20-somethings trying to function in NYC. ""Anthology"" is a unique creation born of a few simple ingredients: <b>an ethnically-diverse cast, improvised dialogue, </b>and<b> gorgeous cinematography</b>.  The intersection of these three elements creates a dynamic experience that has garnered favor amongst various audiences.</div><div><br/></div><div>
<p></p>
<h3>Our Goal is to get Anthology on Television!</h3>
<p></p>
<p>What we need is to continue our story on a larger platform. While the previous season introduced each character individually through six short episodes, the new season will show how these characters function in the world, and how their lives connect over the course of 8 longer-form episodes. We have constructed the series so that both new and returning viewers will be able to join in without missing a beat. The goal is to get the new season on a highly visible network such as IFC, and to do this, we need to raise the funds to finish!</p>
</div>
<div>If you'd like to take a look at our Pilot Season, or just revisit some of your favorite episodes, the full six episodes of <b>Anthology</b> are Available Now!</div><div><br/></div><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fvideoseries%3Flist%3DPL-BPgCCHt4qlUa52SNf26iEtxZTa9Ra_B&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fplaylist%3Flist%3DPL-BPgCCHt4qlUa52SNf26iEtxZTa9Ra_B&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fg--xBKAUIgU%2Fmqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div></div><div>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What Are Some Challenges We Anticipate?</h3>
<p>We are looking for increased publicity and marketing so that we can get this show on TV! Finding the right contacts to spread the word about our show is key, so this is one of the major items we have been working on and will continue to pursue during this process.</p>
<p>Last year, we did not make our fundraising goal and had to shoot 11 days to finish filming all of the scenes involving ""Ashley R."" since our wonderful actress was leaving the country shortly after.

</div>","Hi, my name is Ashley, and I'm making a web series.






Originally from Ohio, I have been living and working in Harlem as an independent filmmaker since 2009. Along with co-owner (and ""Anthology"" star) Ricki Lynée, I run a small production company called Nuanse Entertainment. 

The goal of our company is to create and distribute projects that depict multi-dimensional characters across every genre. Over the last few years, Nuanse has produced films, comedy sketches and music videos that have screened at festivals and showcases across the country. 
Our latest project, Anthology, follows six 20-somethings trying to function in NYC. ""Anthology"" is a unique creation born of a few simple ingredients: an ethnically-diverse cast, improvised dialogue, and gorgeous cinematography.  The intersection of these three elements creates a dynamic experience that has garnered favor amongst various audiences.

Our Goal is to get Anthology on Television!

What we need is to continue our story on a larger platform. While the previous season introduced each character individually through six short episodes, the new season will show how these characters function in the world, and how their lives connect over the course of 8 longer-form episodes. We have constructed the series so that both new and returning viewers will be able to join in without missing a beat. The goal is to get the new season on a highly visible network such as IFC, and to do this, we need to raise the funds to finish!

If you'd like to take a look at our Pilot Season, or just revisit some of your favorite episodes, the full six episodes of Anthology are Available Now!

Our Fundraising Goal Is $4,000. This Will Go To:

HIRING CREW - We can't shoot the show without a great crew! Everyone has an important job and without them, the series won't be the same!

FEEDING CAST & CREW - We have to keep our cast & crew healthy and in good spirits!










CAMERA, SOUND & LIGHTING EQUIPMENT RENTALS - We need great equipment to make our series ready for TV!

LOCATION RENTALS - We need beautiful locations to film our scenes!

MUSIC RIGHTS - Like the music you hear in our promo video? We need great music to make a great show, and the artists need to be paid for their talent!

INSURANCE - Safety First! We need Production Insurance to rent Equipment, Automobiles and to protect our cast & crew under General Liability.

What YOU get for your money:
 We've got some great incentives for your donations, including: 



Invitation to the Cast & Crew Premiere of the new season of ""Anthology""
Dinner with a Cast member

Walk-On Role in an episode of the new season

**We are also offering exclusive, themed ""Character Packages"" which include a special video message from whichever cast member you choose!**

Some highlights from the ""Character Packages"" include:


""Will"": 1-year subscription to GQ Magazine so you can ""Look Sharp & Live Smart""!
""Devina"": Manhattan Karaoke Night with Members of the Cast!

""Reid"": Tickets for YOU & a friend on an NYC City Cruise!

Check out the Rewards section for much, much more!!

What Happens If We Don't Make Our Goal?
The train doesn't stop!

If we don't reach our goal of $4000, the money we DO receive will be that more helpful in allowing the show to continue! It will go to all of the same items we mentioned above (Crew, Rentals, Locations...)! So, jump on board because we're leaving the station!!






What Are Some Challenges We Anticipate?
We are looking for increased publicity and marketing so that we can get this show on TV! Finding the right contacts to spread the word about our show is key, so this is one of the major items we have been working on and will continue to pursue during this process.
Last year, we did not make our fundraising goal and had to shoot 11 days to finish filming all of the scenes involving ""Ashley R."" since our wonderful actress was leaving the country shortly after. Even in the face of this adversity, the amazing work-ethic, camaraderie and faith amongst the Cast and Crew allowed us to get everything finished without compromising our vision, as you can see from the video and images on this page. We will brace ourselves for any future challenges that come our way, and meet them head on with the knowledge that this project is bigger than just us who are working on it.

To this day, most disabled characters on screen fall into the same tropes with no character depth, development or accurate representation (except for example, Isaac from Sex Education – we LOVE YOU). We want to promote the message that people with disabilities are just like everyone else. Both of us are swimmers ourselves and admire the freedom we feel when in the water – which is something we want reflected in the film.</p><p>Rather than showcasing a character who has a disability and struggles with it, Take Your Mark aims to present the character as someone who has been disabled/impaired by the barriers of society (social construct of disability). Our main character is not defined by her disability; it is simply a part of her.</p><p>Alongside our message within the film, we also aim to employ a crew and core members of the team where <strong><u>at least</u> 15% have a disability</strong>. As you’ve seen in the video, the film industry has a lot of catching up to do and we want to help in that much needed change.</p><p>We hope to inspire another generation of athletes with disabilities and assist in abolishing the negative stigma behind disabilities.</p><p>This project will also be used as a proof of concept for a limited series in order to bring these stories to a larger audience.</p><p>#NoFilmAboutUsWithoutUs</p><p>#WeThe15</p><p> </p><p><strong>THE STORY</strong></p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Sports Fiction Drama</p><p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> After being tasked to start swimming by her doctor, a disabled teenager with Cerebral Palsy tries out for her local swim team and discovers her new dream of becoming a Paralympic swimmer.</p><p>Our main character arrives at the training pool with big dreams, only to struggle getting in to the non-accessible front door. She jumps into the pool for tryouts, fully aware that the whole team expects her to drown. During the tryout, her stamina helps her keep up with the rest of the swimmers but her form falters and she fails to qualify for the team. The coach spots our main character staying late to practise her form and gives her some advice. The coach’s usual advice doesn’t seem to work and they must adapt their coaching style to help her improve her stroke. Impressed with her perseverance, the coach invites her on to the team - she is one step closer to her dream.</p><p>This short will follow a similar style to Sex Education and How to Sell Drugs Online (fast) by Netflix. These shows portray timeless but modern locations with vibrant blocks of colour on neutral backgrounds. As you can see in our video, our location is modern but neutral – therefore we will be using pops of reds, yellows and pinks to help our characters stand out or blend in, depending on their role.</p><p>Man on Fire (2004) is a great example of this.</p><p> </p><p><strong>MEET THE TEAM</strong></p><p>We are so excited to be working with the team we have so far.

But as the entity begins to further target Kristen, personal issues must be put aside in order to save their friend before it is too late.  Director's Statement:""A familial bond is a powerful thing. Sometimes too powerful. Someone can your best friend, but can turn into your worst enemy upon moving in together. With many of us spending a lot of time at home recently, it’s surely been on everyone’s mind. Dead Girl is a film about good friends and bad roommates, and a film for those of us who have hated someone just as much as they loved them.""  The Team:Jake Marston (Writer/Director)Jake Marston is the writer and director of Dead Girl, who wanted to make a film for good friends who might be bad roommates.

<h3>How We Got Here</h3>
<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to visit the ""Into Nowhere"" campaign page! My name is Natalie Slone; I'm the producer and screenwriter on this project. It's been such a joy to be a part of this film.</p>
<p>The reason ""Into Nowhere"" exists is because of the director, Bennett Morton, a film student at Middle Tennessee State University. I met Bennett on a set in January. We became fast friends, and shortly after, he asked me to write a script for him to direct. Spoiler alert: I agreed. After taking inspiration from films like <i>Frances Ha</i> (Noah Baumbach, 2013) and <i>Whisper of the Heart </i>(Yoshifumi Kondo, 1995), ""Into Nowhere"" was born.</p>

<p>One of my favorite things about the arts is the ability to collaborate with others. We've partnered with Nashville DP* and gaffer, Jarrett Jarvis, as well as award-winning composer Kennoniah Bellile to help us bring this story to life. When it comes to our crew, our goal is to invest in students by giving them an opportunity to develop their skills on a set where they can be proud of the result.</p>

<h3>The Film</h3>
<p>""Into Nowhere"" is a slice-of-life short film. It revolves around Elle and Brett, two long-time friends in their mid-20's whose jobs and relationships have caused them to drift apart. After Elle has a tough day, Brett off-handedly suggests she go for a drive to clear her mind. Little does he realize she'll heed his advice. . .and take him along for the ride! </p>
<p>In the isolation of the car, they not only face the reality of their individual situations, but they also confront the effects their situations have had on their relationship. This is a story of a rekindled friendship and learning to live in limbo.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $5000 in order to make this film the best it can be. With this amount, we'll be able to accomplish more in terms of casting actors, renting equipment, and investing in post-production quality.</p>
<p>On to my favorite part! We'll be sending you a variety of rewards packages to thank you for each donation we receive. We have a lot of exciting perks such as stickers, film posters, exclusive behind-the-scenes vlogs, first access to the finished film, and more! The rewards packages are cumulative, so if you order a $50 package, you will receive all the items included up to $50.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our story has a message. Its purpose is to provide a wholesome film which leaves the audience feeling encouraged and hopeful. We live in a world where unity is scarce, and it doesn't take much for a relationship to drift apart. With our story, we want to impact people's hearts. If we can accomplish that within even one person, I'll say, ""Mission accomplished.""</p>
<p>Also, by investing in this film, you'll be investing in the next generation of filmmakers and storytellers. By hiring actors and crew department heads who are established in their craft, we can give film students some hands-on set opportunity.</p>
<p>We need your help in order to make it happen. This is the largest amount of money I've attempted to raise, and it's the project with the highest stakes to date. On top of everything involved with production, we plan on going all-out with the films' festival submissions.</p>
<p>When it comes to festivals, last year, my short film, ""The Grand Inquisitor,"" was accepted to two local festivals (Nashville Edge Film Festival and the Southeast International Film Festival) and a film I wrote, ""Nina,"" won the Audience Award and the Lipscomb 5-Minute Film Festival. This time, in addition to the local festivals, we're aiming big for the Sundance Film Festival (among many others)!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It's no secret that film making is not an easy task. Due to the film's setting being a road trip, there are some logistical hoops we must jump through with the assistance of a variety of resources: camera tricks, equipment, set pieces; your donations will help us acquire the resources, and we'll put in the time to figure out the quirks of our logistics in the months leading up to production.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard resources required for a film, those listed above in the proposed budget, we also need to make sure we have the ability to accommodate safety on set. Though we are on the back-end of the pandemic, set safety is still a priority of ours. When we get closer to production, we will check the recommended CDC guidelines for a safe production to ensure the health of our crew.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Know that every little bit helps! And please SPREAD THE WORD!</p>
<p>If you're unable to contribute financially, tell your friends! Share that link to social media, post an Insta-story, or follow @slone_films on Instagram, where you can see production updates. We are grateful for any support you're able to give. Knowing just that you're interested means the world to us.</p>
