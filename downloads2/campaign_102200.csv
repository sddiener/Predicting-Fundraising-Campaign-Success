<p>We are working hard every day to bring you the best game we possibly can. We go to every single indie game event we can afford to.

<p>We are making this game all by ourselves without any funding until now, only with the support of our family and friends and some freelance jobs. Also, we had to hire an artist to help us with the levels' backgrounds and character concepts, while our main artist is taking care of the animations and effects in-game. Part of the money will serve to improve old art and effects, as well as bringing more scenarios and skins for the characters.</p>
<p>Although we are all very committed to finishing this game regardless of commercial success, we need to pay some bills to put it on the market for you guys to play and hopefully continue making games as a way of living.</p>

Yes!  I'll give examples of a few concept characters in the updates. There are reasons I don't want to divulge too much info about lots of characters. It's an area of design that's very subject to change. ""Operating Budget"" will influence how many, and which heroes can be brought to life first. But I want to cover how heroes and hero progression will work. I foresee 3 types of heroes: full-Combat, support-Combat, and non-Combat.  All heroes will progress in three main ways, eXPerience, items, and skills. Nothing new there. XP is as boring as it sounds. It's a numerical value and heroes will ""level up"" at defined thresholds. For items I'm leaning towards classic looking ""paper-doll"" character sheets. Early in development heroes will likely all have a very simple, cookie-cutter template with some item slots on it. As heroes (and the game) develops I want these templates to change in ways that suit each character individually. Most games use very formulaic systems that are easy for them to implement and maintain. 20 bits of A make an itemA. Combine itemA and itemB to get itemC. By the time you get to LMNOP you need hundreds of bitA to assemble the requisite ""recipe"". Bo-o-o-r-ing! My idea is to have some items be ""consumable"", but not all. For example, you might find a leather cap lying about in the early dungeons. Later you encounter a novice blacksmith who can craft you the steel shell of a basic helm, but you'll need to provide the ""liner"". So the leather cap is consumed in making the basic helm. The next scenario might lead to a crafter who can reinforce the structure making it into a superior helm. A new city might house an artisan who will append wings or horns and make it a great helm. The new item replaces the old at each step. Conversely, there might be a different path where instead you purchase a ready-made chain-mail coif. You would equip the better gear leaving the leather cap in inventory. Over time you can accumulate a stash of rudimentary gear. The idea is when a new hero joins your party you won't need to slog thru the level 1 rats every time, they can start out with hand-me-down gear. Lastly heroes will acquire skills. The methods of learning new skills will be as varied as I can possibly make them. Unlike most RPG these will not follow a predetermined tree in most cases (tho character themes will dictate what's reasonable). But skills will be acquired mostly by interacting with the world.

These decks make it possible for individuals to enjoy...card games with friends and family. A dark background makes the cards easier to see on the table."" ~VisionAware (TM) Resources for Independent Living with Vision Loss (Recreational Activities for Seniors with Visual Impairments : Card Games ""You do a trivia quiz because you want to answer the questions, see what you know and display your mastery of the subject matter at hand. The score lets you know how well you did but your primary interest is the questions themselves. No one is telling you that you have to answer these questions, your motivation is intrinsic (self display of mastery) and so the questions aren't seen as an obstacle but as an opportunity."" ~ Will Kerslake, Game Developer""I listen to music all the time and I like to print lyrics of songs and memorize them. Sometimes I can feel the meaning in a song if I listen closely. I can find inspiration and courage in good songs. I am always looking at good parts of songs and thinking of how I can make my own songs."" ~ Cassandra""I began listening to lyrics more closely once I realized how much music is made that relates to me."" ~ Ashley*The cited statistics and quotes above are used as reference and to emphasize the value of your contribution to help those with visual impairments.

<h3>Why we choose flexible funding</h3>
<p>You may notice, that we will receive all raised money even if we won’t reach our funding goals. We choose this type of funding, because we will work on this project, regardless of the success of this campaign. We love it and we want to create a good game. Without money, it just takes a lot more time. And will be less items in game.</p>
<p>In other words, any amount of money will help us reach our objective and we’ll still be able to fulfill your perks. If you are still in doubt, you can ask any questions to us here or on our page on facebook. We are open for communication :)</p>

<br/>
<h3>More about the game</h3>
<b>Battle Mechanics</b>
<p>Battles in the game take place on special areas and different number of participants on each side from 1v1 to 21v21. The main task of a fighter during the battle to survive  and not allow the enemy to continue the fight, inflicting damage, breaking gear or slung over the fence.</p>
<br/>
<b>How our fights are different from others?</b>
<p>Many strikes and techniques used in the existing games, are ineffective or just not possible in real life,  though look beautifully. It isn't suitable for our simulator therefore we consciously refuse many spectacular things. You will be able to learn and repeat each game movement in reality. Also all the tactics of combat in the game will be usable in a real battle.</p>
<br/>
<b>Training in real gyms</b>
<p>Unique feature of Medieval Steel Warriors is connection of real and virtual trainings. If you are actively engaged in the gym, you can count your real workout in the game and enhance your character. To be cool virtual fighter you are no longer required to sit at the computer for hours ;)</p>
<br/>
<b>The training of fighter</b>
<p>During the game your character gets the points that can be distributed to improve strength, agility, endurance, etc. You decide which features and how to improve them depending on your fighting style. However, the higher the value of the characteristic, the more points are spent for each improvement.</p>
<p>Also, the character has skills that develop only when they are used. Initially, a beginner knows about all the techniques in theory, but don't know how to apply them efficiently. Using the techniques during the fight or training, the player improves the skills and their combinations, making them faster, more successful and accurate.</p>
<br/>
<b>Training halls</b>
<p>For development of the fighter you can visit virtual training halls. The efficiency of your trainings will change depending on indicators of the hall. For example, in the branded hall with the fencing instructor you improve skills faster.</p>
<p>Anyone will be able to open training halls in game. Moreover, if you are the owner of the training hall in reality, you can decorate a virtual hall as a real and specify your contact information. Free of charge.</p>
<br/>
<b>Craft items</b>
<p>Players earn money by fighting but if you need a break and money not enough you can do crafting gear. Already at medium crafting skills, you will be able to make weapons and armor better than is sold by NPCs.</p>
<br/>
<b>Matchmaking and devices</b>
<p>Selection of opponents for fight is carried out automatically or by a direct call on duel or the appointed fight between teams. With automatic selection of the enemy system will select an opponent equal to you. In duels and team fights you should estimate the rival.</p>
<p>Due to the different control playing with a mobile device, you cannot fight with the players on your PC. And vice versa.</p>
<br/>
<b>Championships</b>
<p>Eventually various championships for individual fighters and teams will take place in game. The rules will be slightly different depending on the scale and participants of the championship. So for the leadership in all events it will be necessary to become really skillful fighter, not just dress up in the best things.</p>
<br/>
<b>How much is the game?</b>
<p>Medieval Steel Warriors is free-to-play game. Everything in the game will be available for ingamemoney or achievement.</p>
<p>The PC version of game will initially have restrictions, it will be impossible to use the general and private chats, there will be no access to auction and trade, fights will be inaccessible. To remove the restrictions, you will have to buy a digital key for real or ingame money.</p>
<br/>
<b>Open source client and game server</b>
<p>Over the years in the gaming industry, we understood that the absolute protection against cheaters on the client does not exist. Therefore, we have decided not to interfere with the honest players and focus on improving the game server logic that any attempts to cheat are not possible or became immediately visible.</p>
<p>Through this approach, we can afford to open the source code for the client and the game server (the code which is responsible for authorization, financial operations, operations over game subjects and change of indicators of fighters remains closed).</p>
<br/>
<b>Create fights with your own rules</b>
<p>With open source client and game server we allow players to make modifications of the game and to open private servers. In addition, each private server will appear in the list of servers for all players after moderation. Those who wish to play on a private server will be able to select it from the list to automatically obtain the missing resources in the client and start playing.</p>
<h3>Technical preview</h3>
<p>Now we have a technical preview of the game. Movements of fighters in it are used from
other games. We will capture correct movements after fundraising.</p>

You may notice, that we will receive all raised money even if we won’t reach our funding goals. We choose this type of funding, because we will work on this project, regardless of the success of this campaign. We love it and we want to create a good game. Without money, it just takes a lot more time. And will be less items in game.
In other words, any amount of money will help us reach our objective and we’ll still be able to fulfill your perks. If you are still in doubt, you can ask any questions to us here or on our page on facebook. We are open for communication :)






More about the game
Battle Mechanics
Battles in the game take place on special areas and different number of participants on each side from 1v1 to 21v21. The main task of a fighter during the battle to survive  and not allow the enemy to continue the fight, inflicting damage, breaking gear or slung over the fence.

How our fights are different from others?
Many strikes and techniques used in the existing games, are ineffective or just not possible in real life,  though look beautifully. It isn't suitable for our simulator therefore we consciously refuse many spectacular things. You will be able to learn and repeat each game movement in reality. Also all the tactics of combat in the game will be usable in a real battle.

Training in real gyms
Unique feature of Medieval Steel Warriors is connection of real and virtual trainings. If you are actively engaged in the gym, you can count your real workout in the game and enhance your character. To be cool virtual fighter you are no longer required to sit at the computer for hours ;)

The training of fighter
During the game your character gets the points that can be distributed to improve strength, agility, endurance, etc. You decide which features and how to improve them depending on your fighting style. However, the higher the value of the characteristic, the more points are spent for each improvement.
Also, the character has skills that develop only when they are used. Initially, a beginner knows about all the techniques in theory, but don't know how to apply them efficiently. Using the techniques during the fight or training, the player improves the skills and their combinations, making them faster, more successful and accurate.

Training halls
For development of the fighter you can visit virtual training halls. The efficiency of your trainings will change depending on indicators of the hall. For example, in the branded hall with the fencing instructor you improve skills faster.
Anyone will be able to open training halls in game. Moreover, if you are the owner of the training hall in reality, you can decorate a virtual hall as a real and specify your contact information. Free of charge.

Craft items
Players earn money by fighting but if you need a break and money not enough you can do crafting gear. Already at medium crafting skills, you will be able to make weapons and armor better than is sold by NPCs.

Matchmaking and devices
Selection of opponents for fight is carried out automatically or by a direct call on duel or the appointed fight between teams. With automatic selection of the enemy system will select an opponent equal to you. In duels and team fights you should estimate the rival.
Due to the different control playing with a mobile device, you cannot fight with the players on your PC. And vice versa.

Championships
Eventually various championships for individual fighters and teams will take place in game. The rules will be slightly different depending on the scale and participants of the championship. So for the leadership in all events it will be necessary to become really skillful fighter, not just dress up in the best things.

How much is the game?
Medieval Steel Warriors is free-to-play game. Everything in the game will be available for ingamemoney or achievement.
The PC version of game will initially have restrictions, it will be impossible to use the general and private chats, there will be no access to auction and trade, fights will be inaccessible. To remove the restrictions, you will have to buy a digital key for real or ingame money.

Open source client and game server
Over the years in the gaming industry, we understood that the absolute protection against cheaters on the client does not exist. Therefore, we have decided not to interfere with the honest players and focus on improving the game server logic that any attempts to cheat are not possible or became immediately visible.
Through this approach, we can afford to open the source code for the client and the game server (the code which is responsible for authorization, financial operations, operations over game subjects and change of indicators of fighters remains closed).

Create fights with your own rules
With open source client and game server we allow players to make modifications of the game and to open private servers. In addition, each private server will appear in the list of servers for all players after moderation. Those who wish to play on a private server will be able to select it from the list to automatically obtain the missing resources in the client and start playing.
Technical preview
Now we have a technical preview of the game. Movements of fighters in it are used from
other games. We will capture correct movements after fundraising.

<p>My name is Kai Alias. I am a 3D artist, part-time lecturer for 3D/drawing/animation since 2009, and I love co-op story driven games!</p>

<p>Stray Alloys is a labor of love, created by Faiz (our programmer) and me. It’s fueled by our passion for retro games and shooters. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559011038/qo5jase4bsfh5zcv3lpv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Faiz and I used to share a computer lab, where he was creating a super early prototype on his own while I was teaching university students. I saw his work and said, “let's start something here!” I had only one condition for helping him, I wanted the game and the story to be playable with another player. Other members of the team were guys I worked with from previous workplaces; they wanted to join in and the rest is history! We rented a new place and started working on our game project there. Most of us work on these part-time due to budget. It has been <strong>2 years</strong> with a very limited <strong>budget of USD $917 per month</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Stray alloys</strong> &amp; <strong>Co-op Legion Studio</strong> mean a lot to us as we are developing our first game and the first game produced in Brunei as well. We want to change the general perspective on the games industry in Brunei. We want investors to see the benefit of investing in something new, not just from a monetary point of view, but something to help the community by creating new jobs. We want to change people's mindsets here, where it's not about just working a 9 to 5 job, we want to make people care about the things they do and their jobs, instead of just caring about a degree/diploma and credentials. Most people here assume it will automatically guarantee a stable job, which is not the case.</p>

<p>We feel the gaming industry in general, is moving away from co-op story campaign; most games are either singleplayer-only or PvP multiplayer games, with many adopting mobile style monetization schemes. Occasionally, a co-op story-driven campaign will appear, but they are few and far between.</p>

<p>Additionally, we want to allow people to mod our games. Mods are great! People out there are trying things differently, coming up with very inventive and imaginative modifications. Helping create a platform for others to create their own games or earn a living making mods is something we encourage. If you feel the same way, please support us any way you can!</p>
<p>Currently, we are only focusing on the PC platform. In the future, other platforms may become viable options.</p>

<p>Here you see our early iteration of the drone. initially, we wanted a drone with wheels just to show some drones that were weak and primitive but at the time, we tried to animate and make the wheels have physics to them and turned out too heavy to have many of these fighting the players. So we had to change the wheels to something else. we decided to go with a flying drone. We may go back to wheels if we get funding and see if we can hire someone who can easily fix this problem or not. But at the moment, we won't be using this design. </p>

<p>So we have one investor/backer who is interested in being in our game. We usually ask our investors or backers if they want to be in our game. Most say no as they don't have the desire and just want to support the game and get the merchandise like the figures and statues.</p>
<p>We recently started a 3D printing business as well called 3D Forge Studios that is dedicated to making 3D prints for people. This gives us the opportunity to make our figures/ statues for our backers; since we are big fans of game merchandise as well. We got the Form 2 SLA printer to help us with that. We plan to print a master copy and make duplicates. We have some Creality FDM printers but the quality and the amount of detail we can do with those are limited so we will be using the Form2 printer to make our figure/statues.</p>

<p>Keep in mind this a pre pre alpha build test so there will be bugs and issues, not the final game or close to it as we got a very long way to go. But this is just to let people try out our progress so far. We only had 2-3 weeks to put the map together and everything else, we have a very limited budget and resources so keep that in mind while playing our demo. We would like to get more funding so we can hire better people for certain things such as sound fx, music and level designer or more people for the assets such as 3d models, programming, animation and other stuff. So if you want to help us let me know, IF you're looking for a paying job, well we'll short on funds right now but the moment we get money or funds, everyone will get paid.</p>

<p>Currently, we are spending <strong>917USD per month</strong>, here's the breakdown for our current budget:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>587USD</strong> for Rent</li>
<li>
<strong>147USD</strong> on Internet ( ya, our internet is really expensive for<strong> JUST 30MBPS</strong> but what to do)</li>
<li>
<strong>147USD</strong> for Faiz (Our programmer, ideally we want to give<strong> 184USD</strong> to<strong> 367USD</strong> per person on the core team)</li>
<li>
<strong>36USD</strong> for Azim (Our Animator, I know it's a joke pay but that's all I can afford, he understand our situation BUT I want to give him <strong>184USD</strong> to<strong> 367USD</strong> as well)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>367USD per month</strong> is low but still we need to budget things unless we get tons of money then I can spare <strong>1,000USD per person</strong>. </p>
<ul>
<li>For a lean case, we're looking for <strong>4,000USD per month</strong> for rent, internet and the core team, including myself. </li>
<li>For the best case, we're looking for<strong> 8,000USD per month</strong> so we can spend <strong>4,000USD</strong> for outsourcing work such as music, sound effects, level design, more modelers and animators.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>We plan to work on this game for<strong> 3 to 5 years</strong> ideally but if things get complicated maybe <strong>5 to 7  years</strong>. If we can get proper funding it might be shorter but we want to make sure investors are prepared IF we don't hit the 5 year deadline.</p>
<ul>
<li>For Lean case, <strong>4,000USD</strong> <strong>per month</strong> for 5-7 years will be<strong> 240,000USD</strong> for <strong>5 years</strong> (<strong>336,000USD </strong>for<strong> 7 years</strong>)</li>
<li>For Best case,<strong> 8,000USD per month</strong> for 5-7 years will be <strong>480,000USD</strong> for <strong>5  years</strong> <strong>(672,000USD for 7 years)</strong> anything after will be great and will be spent on just increasing the production value aka hiring more people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's our schedule to do for each year when funded:</p>
<p><strong>First Year: </strong>Pre-production work to be done (Story, Script, All character concepts, All environment concepts, level design all should be done) </p>
<p><strong>Second Year</strong>: Production work to be done (All character models and Level models to be done) </p>
<p><strong>Third Year:</strong> More Production work to be done (Gameplay finalized, VFX all done, All levels to be done and cutscenes to be done with voice acting)</p>
<p><strong>Forth - Seventh Year:</strong> Post production work to be done + Debugging(Polishing the game, finishing up the artbook and statues) </p>
<p> </p>

<p>I know there's a lot of scammers out there saying they are making a product and end up not delivering anything at all, making anyone who genuinely wants to produce something a lot harder. I got a letter of recommendation from '<strong>Derek Eversfield</strong>', who is a veteran animator in the animation industry.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1557989173/xdruvfcpd2rvjjnt1mzu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Aside from being a veteran animator, <strong>Derek Eversfield</strong> is also an apprentice and great friend with the legendary figure artist '<strong>Glenn Vilppu</strong>'. You can easily IMDB Derek Eversfield and Glenn Vilppu is pretty famous in the art world. Things that Derek is famous for working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>BraveStarr </li>
<li> Iron man (1996)</li>
<li>Chip N Dale</li>
<li>HBO Spawn</li>
</ul>
<p>I had the pleasure to work with, study under and someone I can call my close friend. He is willing to put his reputation of <strong>over 34 years</strong> on the line for me and I don't plan to disappoint him, my team or anyone who put money in our product. </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">So the good news is we ever lose our way somehow, I can talk to Derek for advice on how to handle problems and what to expect in the production pipeline as Derek has the experience to guide me and my team if we ever need it. </span></p>

<p>We are a very small studio with very little budget. We run the studio with little outsource work and limited investment money to help develop Stray Alloys. The challenge is that we want to create our game at the highest quality we can make. Right now, we are at a mediocre level of production. We want to push this to a very professional looking production where we can be proud of.</p>
<p>If we raise enough funds, we can improve pretty much everything such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level designs</li>
<li>Sound effects</li>
<li>Assets</li>
<li>Voice acting/Sound dialogue</li>
<li>Cutscenes</li>
<li>Story/Script</li>
</ul>
<p>Part of the challenge is that we are asking for a lot of funding because we don't want to underestimate the cost as the worst case scenario will be developing a game and running out of budget to continue. </p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, we will still continue to develop our game just it will be developed at a much slower rate and lower production value, which is where we are at right now and we are not happy at the rate of progress we are going it. We want to do more!</p>
<p>Another challenge we face with recent development is that the PC marketplace is shifting. Our original intention is to sell our game on steam and other platforms but Epic store is being aggressive in getting exclusives. We understand why Epic is doing this but we also understand why people still prefer steam. So we are hoping to sell on both marketplaces as one we are using Unreal Engine 4.</p>
<p>IF we get fully funded, we will listen to the backer's request. I just hope Epic will respect our decision to let us sell our game on other platforms. Epic definitely makes great incentives compared to steam from a developer's point of view, but we want to be for the community. We will keep everyone up to date when the time comes. </p>
<p>Alternatively, if we don't get funded and somehow Epic funds our project then at that point, we probably will have to go exclusive to their marketplace. But we are hoping to avoid that scenario. But that's the plan if things don't go well in Indiegogo funding.  </p>

</div></div>","My name is Kai Alias. I am a 3D artist, part-time lecturer for 3D/drawing/animation since 2009, and I love co-op story driven games!

Stray Alloys is a labor of love, created by Faiz (our programmer) and me. It’s fueled by our passion for retro games and shooters. 

Faiz and I used to share a computer lab, where he was creating a super early prototype on his own while I was teaching university students. I saw his work and said, “let's start something here!” I had only one condition for helping him, I wanted the game and the story to be playable with another player. Other members of the team were guys I worked with from previous workplaces; they wanted to join in and the rest is history! We rented a new place and started working on our game project there. Most of us work on these part-time due to budget. It has been 2 years with a very limited budget of USD $917 per month.
 
Stray alloys & Co-op Legion Studio mean a lot to us as we are developing our first game and the first game produced in Brunei as well. We want to change the general perspective on the games industry in Brunei. We want investors to see the benefit of investing in something new, not just from a monetary point of view, but something to help the community by creating new jobs. We want to change people's mindsets here, where it's not about just working a 9 to 5 job, we want to make people care about the things they do and their jobs, instead of just caring about a degree/diploma and credentials. Most people here assume it will automatically guarantee a stable job, which is not the case.
 

We feel the gaming industry in general, is moving away from co-op story campaign; most games are either singleplayer-only or PvP multiplayer games, with many adopting mobile style monetization schemes. Occasionally, a co-op story-driven campaign will appear, but they are few and far between.
 

Additionally, we want to allow people to mod our games. Mods are great! People out there are trying things differently, coming up with very inventive and imaginative modifications. Helping create a platform for others to create their own games or earn a living making mods is something we encourage. If you feel the same way, please support us any way you can!
Currently, we are only focusing on the PC platform. In the future, other platforms may become viable options.
 

 
From 15/8/2018, we designed the main character Ray, from several different concept ideas, 3D sculpts, some test renders look and finally to what we have is an in-game model. 

First early concepts of Ray

We didn't get to implement the melee system currently but that's what we are working towards right now.
 

Early Test render and Test texture/material
 

Current in-game 3D Model
There are side characters in development but I do want to leave some surprises for players when the game is complete. That secret I need to hold until the game comes out. 
 

Along doing the concept, modeling for the main character, we also were doing concept and modeling for the enemies.

First concepts for standard drone
You can tell we used the last concept for the jumper drone as we felt it's got an interesting look.
 

Early Concepts 01 of Drone 
 

Early Concepts 02 of Drone
 

Early 3D render of Drone
Here you see our early iteration of the drone. initially, we wanted a drone with wheels just to show some drones that were weak and primitive but at the time, we tried to animate and make the wheels have physics to them and turned out too heavy to have many of these fighting the players. So we had to change the wheels to something else. we decided to go with a flying drone. We may go back to wheels if we get funding and see if we can hire someone who can easily fix this problem or not. But at the moment, we won't be using this design. 
 

Latest design for drone minion/wire-frame view 
 
October 2018 Update for our Mini Drone
 

Early concepts for Jumper drone
So we redesigned the jumper drone and one of the jumper drone designs we changed into an ostrich drone.  As you can tell, we started the concept since June 2017.
 

3D sculpt and build up for Jumper drone

Ostrich Minion Animation set
At this stage, we did all the animation for the Ostrich drone but haven't added the AI for it and the Jumper drone we started doing the animation for it. The video above was recorded at an earlier time and we had technical issues during that time, so sorry for the quality though.
 

First concepts for shield/sniper type minions

Due to a lack of budget, we only have time and money to design one boss. We're hoping to do more and quicker if we get more funding. 

Early concept 01 of mech boss
 

Early concept 02 of mech boss
 

The concept for mech boss
We're big fans of giant mechs so we had to include it as one of our bosses, plus it's a good way to show the scale of power. 
 

3/4 view of giant mech boss
 

3D build-up test for mech boss
The 3D build up for the mech boss is different from the concept, but like everything else, all is subject to change. 
 

Mech pilot war veteran concept
The face is subject to change since we're letting backers get to be some of the bosses.
 

We did some UI design layout for the upgrade trees for weapons and character. Icons for the UI are subject to change as they need some work.

Weapons Upgrade UI Screen Concept
 

Character Upgrade UI Screen Concept
 


The concept for Environment city
 

Early 3D mock-up for City
From concept to a 3D mock-up. The first city level we planned would be something based close to our world but with some differences. The skyline would have a distant planet and giant structures supporting the atmosphere dome for the space station. The idea is that each space station represents a different style, country and culture.
 

Blocking for our city level
 







Buildings we built for our city level

We designed several items and did 3D mock-ups.

Early concept of health potion
The initial idea was to make a health potion as a tribute to old RPGs. Although just thinking about it from a functional point of view, having a beaker as a health potion wasn't a great idea. We still wanted a pay tribute to old RPGs but at the same time, we wanted to make the items like functional and futuristic.
 
 
First 3D mock-up for the health potion
This stage, as much we wanted to mimic the old version of health potions, Red was not working for it, Our health bar was green as well. So we changed that.
 

Latest 3D mock-up for our Health Potion
Note: Inspired by a water bottle, and the formula is a formula for green apple flavor. 
 

3D mock-up for our energy pick up
So I didn't want to let go of the old health potion design as it's got a certain charm to it, so I decided to incorporate the design to the energy pick up.
 

3D mock-up for item delivery system
So instead of having some random items just floating around, we wanted to make some sense with the item placements. 
 

Early 3D mock-up for ammo pick up
So the initial design was designing the ammo to be a battery. So the inspiration was laptop batteries but realized the design needed to look more like a magazine. Hence the next design.
 

New 3D mock-up design for the ammo pickup view 01
 

New 3D mock-up design for the ammo pickup view 02
 

3D mock-up of container for multiple health potion
 

3D mock-up of container for multiple energy pick up
 

3D mock-up of container for multiple ammo magazines
 

3D mockup of Inventory chestbox
 
Early Inventory UI management 
 

So one of our reward tiers is to be part of our game as a character or boss. I will sculpt the backer's head as their default head.  we haven't decided, which boss they will be. We do their default head and based on the boss they turned out to be, we can add scars or facial features etc etc to the backer's desire.

Backer's head sculpt progress
So we have one investor/backer who is interested in being in our game. We usually ask our investors or backers if they want to be in our game. Most say no as they don't have the desire and just want to support the game and get the merchandise like the figures and statues.
We recently started a 3D printing business as well called 3D Forge Studios that is dedicated to making 3D prints for people. This gives us the opportunity to make our figures/ statues for our backers; since we are big fans of game merchandise as well. We got the Form 2 SLA printer to help us with that. We plan to print a master copy and make duplicates. We have some Creality FDM printers but the quality and the amount of detail we can do with those are limited so we will be using the Form2 printer to make our figure/statues.


Form2 SLA Printer from Formlabs
 
Other Progress Notes:

Updated old character rig system with new rig animation system to accept motion capture data
Added new gameplay mechanics such as shield mechanic, minimap, item inventory, melee combat system and upgrade system.
Improved AI system for minions with multiple behavior trees

 
 Raw Co-op Footage for Voice chat test on Steam server
 


Keep in mind this a pre pre alpha build test so there will be bugs and issues, not the final game or close to it as we got a very long way to go. But this is just to let people try out our progress so far. We only had 2-3 weeks to put the map together and everything else, we have a very limited budget and resources so keep that in mind while playing our demo. We would like to get more funding so we can hire better people for certain things such as sound fx, music and level designer or more people for the assets such as 3d models, programming, animation and other stuff. So if you want to help us let me know, IF you're looking for a paying job, well we'll short on funds right now but the moment we get money or funds, everyone will get paid.
  
NOTE: PLEASE READ ALL THE NOTES BEFORE PLAYING BOTH DEMOS
Build 1.5 was made two years ago when we first started and inspired by mega man of course. We made our own characters and building our demo level at this current time. Below are the key binding and controller mapping.

Currently, we are spending 917USD per month, here's the breakdown for our current budget:


587USD for Rent

147USD on Internet ( ya, our internet is really expensive for JUST 30MBPS but what to do)

147USD for Faiz (Our programmer, ideally we want to give 184USD to 367USD per person on the core team)

36USD for Azim (Our Animator, I know it's a joke pay but that's all I can afford, he understand our situation BUT I want to give him 184USD to 367USD as well)

367USD per month is low but still we need to budget things unless we get tons of money then I can spare 1,000USD per person. 

For a lean case, we're looking for 4,000USD per month for rent, internet and the core team, including myself. 
For the best case, we're looking for 8,000USD per month so we can spend 4,000USD for outsourcing work such as music, sound effects, level design, more modelers and animators.

 
We plan to work on this game for 3 to 5 years ideally but if things get complicated maybe 5 to 7  years. If we can get proper funding it might be shorter but we want to make sure investors are prepared IF we don't hit the 5 year deadline.

For Lean case, 4,000USD per month for 5-7 years will be 240,000USD for 5 years (336,000USD for 7 years)
For Best case, 8,000USD per month for 5-7 years will be 480,000USD for 5  years (672,000USD for 7 years) anything after will be great and will be spent on just increasing the production value aka hiring more people.

Here's our schedule to do for each year when funded:
First Year: Pre-production work to be done (Story, Script, All character concepts, All environment concepts, level design all should be done) 
Second Year: Production work to be done (All character models and Level models to be done) 
Third Year: More Production work to be done (Gameplay finalized, VFX all done, All levels to be done and cutscenes to be done with voice acting)
Forth - Seventh Year: Post production work to be done + Debugging(Polishing the game, finishing up the artbook and statues) 
 










We might add T-Shirts, digital and physical wallpapers to the rewards but I would like to discuss it with backers, if they want it or not. I'm not keen on T-Shirts as different countries have different sizes and it's easy to mess that one up but if backers still insist on wanting T-Shirts, I will add it to the rewards.
  

240,000USD for Minimum Core Development for our game project

Includes co-op/solo campaign with the story but very limited production value for storytelling.
Includes mod support
Includes art book + figures for backers

336,000USD for Basic Core Development for our game project

Add on to increase to production value to cinematic
Additional levels to campaign

480,000USD for Mid Level Development for our game project

Add voice acting with limited animated cutscenes
Improve gameplay mechanics and design
Increase production value for:

Character models
Script and dialogue
Environment + concepts (artbook)
Sound Design + Music


672,000USD and above for Best Development for our game project

Full-voiced and animated cut scenes 
Full High production value in:
Character models
Script and dialogue
Environment + concepts (artbook)
Sound Design + Music



IF for some miracle we manage to raise 1,000,000USD - 3,000,000USD for our game project
We will want to outsource all our cutscenes (we will need to discuss with our backers, if they prefer the cutscenes to be animated in-game or high production 3D cinematic similar to blur studios or just animated in 2D) 
 

Aside from keeping regular updates either weekly or monthly progress, Any backers putting 1,000USD+ will have access to our files and financial spending so they know where the money is going.
I know there's a lot of scammers out there saying they are making a product and end up not delivering anything at all, making anyone who genuinely wants to produce something a lot harder. I got a letter of recommendation from 'Derek Eversfield', who is a veteran animator in the animation industry.



Aside from being a veteran animator, Derek Eversfield is also an apprentice and great friend with the legendary figure artist 'Glenn Vilppu'. You can easily IMDB Derek Eversfield and Glenn Vilppu is pretty famous in the art world. Things that Derek is famous for working on:

BraveStarr 
 Iron man (1996)
Chip N Dale
HBO Spawn

I had the pleasure to work with, study under and someone I can call my close friend. He is willing to put his reputation of over 34 years on the line for me and I don't plan to disappoint him, my team or anyone who put money in our product. 
So the good news is we ever lose our way somehow, I can talk to Derek for advice on how to handle problems and what to expect in the production pipeline as Derek has the experience to guide me and my team if we ever need it. 
 


We are a very small studio with very little budget. We run the studio with little outsource work and limited investment money to help develop Stray Alloys. The challenge is that we want to create our game at the highest quality we can make. Right now, we are at a mediocre level of production. We want to push this to a very professional looking production where we can be proud of.
If we raise enough funds, we can improve pretty much everything such as:

Level designs
Sound effects
Assets
Voice acting/Sound dialogue
Cutscenes
Story/Script

Part of the challenge is that we are asking for a lot of funding because we don't want to underestimate the cost as the worst case scenario will be developing a game and running out of budget to continue. 
If we don't reach our goal, we will still continue to develop our game just it will be developed at a much slower rate and lower production value, which is where we are at right now and we are not happy at the rate of progress we are going it. We want to do more!
Another challenge we face with recent development is that the PC marketplace is shifting. Our original intention is to sell our game on steam and other platforms but Epic store is being aggressive in getting exclusives. We understand why Epic is doing this but we also understand why people still prefer steam. So we are hoping to sell on both marketplaces as one we are using Unreal Engine 4.
IF we get fully funded, we will listen to the backer's request. I just hope Epic will respect our decision to let us sell our game on other platforms. Epic definitely makes great incentives compared to steam from a developer's point of view, but we want to be for the community. We will keep everyone up to date when the time comes. 
Alternatively, if we don't get funded and somehow Epic funds our project then at that point, we probably will have to go exclusive to their marketplace. But we are hoping to avoid that scenario. But that's the plan if things don't go well in Indiegogo funding.

Daily I’m educated to work with IT and I'm at this moment working as an IT-supporter. But I really want to have my own gaming business.</p><p> </p><h3>ABOUT THE GAME</h3><p> </p><p>This game is going to be a multiplayer game. </p><p>One game, 100 players. They will be divided into two big teams of 50, These 50 players will be split into squads. You decide if the squad is 5, 4, 3, 2 or solo players. </p><p>Later on it will be possible to split the teams in 5,10,25 players instead of 50, so more teams with less players.</p><p>Your squad is allowed to team-up with other squads on the team. But mostly you play with your assigned squad. So, you don’t have to focus on what everyone else is doing on your team of 50.  But it will be a good idea to help the rest of the team, if you are able to. <br/>The team needs people who gather resources, secure the capture points, makes weapons, scouts and sneak up on the other team. each class have different tasks, that will give the team and yourself more points. </p><p> </p><p><strong>There’s going to be different tasks:</strong></p><p><strong><u>Main task</u></strong></p><p>Finding the opponents flag.<br/>Getting the flag to your own base.</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Semi main task</u> </strong>                    </p><p>Capture points.<br/>(There's 3 capture points on the entire map)</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Secondary task</u></strong></p><p>Depends on witch class you are, and what you and your squad choose your main focus to be: capturing the flag, defending/attacking capture points, supporter, and so on.</p><p> </p><p>You can win by stealing the other teams’ flag and getting it back to your own base. This gives your team instant win.<br/>You will have about two minutes from you steal the flag before the opponent team gets a warning about the flag is missing. From now on you need to run and hide a lot.<br/>The flag will make you run slower than normal. If you are a <i>FLAGRUNNER</i> you will run faster than other players, but still slow with the flag. So, you need help from your team. This is where you guys need to teamwork a lot. </p><p>You will get extra points if you stick to your own tasks.<br/>If you get some kind of task, you need to complete it for extra points. This will make sure people don’t do less or more than others. And makes sure people don’t just walk around in circles.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576418356/rd0qd7qbbo5lvq7hbkg8.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>GAMEPLAY</h3><p> </p><p><strong>Teamwork</strong><br/>In this game teamwork is important.

And with every squad-size, you will play differently. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Solo players</strong><br/>If you choose to be a solo player in the game. You are most likely to be a scout.

Daily I’m educated to work with IT and I'm at this moment working as an IT-supporter. But I really want to have my own gaming business. ABOUT THE GAME This game is going to be a multiplayer game. One game, 100 players. They will be divided into two big teams of 50, These 50 players will be split into squads. You decide if the squad is 5, 4, 3, 2 or solo players. Later on it will be possible to split the teams in 5,10,25 players instead of 50, so more teams with less players.Your squad is allowed to team-up with other squads on the team. But mostly you play with your assigned squad. So, you don’t have to focus on what everyone else is doing on your team of 50.  But it will be a good idea to help the rest of the team, if you are able to. The team needs people who gather resources, secure the capture points, makes weapons, scouts and sneak up on the other team. each class have different tasks, that will give the team and yourself more points.  There’s going to be different tasks:Main taskFinding the opponents flag.Getting the flag to your own base. Semi main task                     Capture points.(There's 3 capture points on the entire map) Secondary taskDepends on witch class you are, and what you and your squad choose your main focus to be: capturing the flag, defending/attacking capture points, supporter, and so on. You can win by stealing the other teams’ flag and getting it back to your own base. This gives your team instant win.You will have about two minutes from you steal the flag before the opponent team gets a warning about the flag is missing. From now on you need to run and hide a lot.The flag will make you run slower than normal. If you are a FLAGRUNNER you will run faster than other players, but still slow with the flag. So, you need help from your team. This is where you guys need to teamwork a lot. You will get extra points if you stick to your own tasks.If you get some kind of task, you need to complete it for extra points. This will make sure people don’t do less or more than others. And makes sure people don’t just walk around in circles. GAMEPLAY TeamworkIn this game teamwork is important. You have to work together for this game to work out. You need to find a way to communicate and split the assignments (building, crafting etc) between players on the squad.There will be squads of 5-2 people. And with every squad-size, you will play differently.  Solo playersIf you choose to be a solo player in the game. You are most likely to be a scout. This is the perfect assignment for solo players.You main focus will be to assist squads all around the map, where it's needed.  Capture pointsThere will be 3 capture points on the map.  These are really important for the entire game. With capture points you will get more points to buy weapons, tools, medic and more. You will also have less respawn time and will be able to respawn at the new capture point. Killing the other teamYou will have a easy time killing. Because you need to have the opportunity to kill a whole squad by yourself if they don’t pay attention to their surroundings, and dont teamwork. – so, look out! ;-) PermadeathAfter a certain amount of time, if the flag has not been captured from any of the bases, there will be PERMADEATH! This means you will win if you are the last man standing!  or have two out of three of the capture points in X number of minutes, this will make people not just wait and camp. If you get killed during the permadeath you can just leave the game, and still get your reward. SpawningThere is going to be X minutes from you die till you respawn again. When you have one or more capture points you respawn faster. You can also buy less spawn time with the points you get from doing your assignments, tasks and from capture points.There will be less spawn time at the base, than smaller places as your capture points and spawn points which a specific class can make.  LOOTOne should look for loot, such as ammo, weapons (will be rare to find), medic, and things to build, cover, etc.Some special classes can craft/build many suitable things out of the materials your squad finds or buys, and all classes have different things they can craft/build.It's important to loot because when you die and respawn it is expensive to buy all your gear again, and sometimes it is better to save your points, for situations where there is no time to loot WeaponsYou can make a lot of different weapons out of parts that you find around on the map.  You can find barrels, stocks, hull etc. And combine them in different ways. - Of course some parts, doesn't fit together, and some fit very well the better they match, the better the gun will be.(recoil, range, penetration etc.) Some guns can't be changed, only its attachments (scopes,suppressors,mags) Building/crafting/resources.It will be hard to get good weapons and ammo. So dont waste it, but with that said most things can be turned in to a weapon or used as one.  Sticks can be sharpened, rocks can be thrown and traps can be made.You can craft/build many things, like bows, spears, guns, traps, buildings, covers, ammo, armor, decoys, scopes, explosive, etc. When you start (if no points are used) you will spawn with some stuff to help you craft and get going. this will be like a knife, or others stuff. This depends on your class. AssignmentsIn the start of the game you and your squad chooses a class and a main focus on the map, that can either be: going for the enemy flag, capture points, scouts, supporters, saboteurs, or more. then you will get assignments depending on what class you are and what focus you and your squad chose. example if you are a craftsman, and the focus is capture points you will get assignment to craft weapons and ammo for your team, while you and your squad will get a assignment together to capture, defend or hold a capture point. Every class and squad will get different assignments to mainly follow, and i would recommend following the assaignments, unless you and your squad really thinks this is a good plan or have a game changing plan.Following the assignments, will give you an advantage, in the way of points, that you can use on weapons or other kinds of gears.This will make people not run around doing nothing. ClassesIn the game there will be different kinds of classes. You are going to pick what you want to be in the start of the game. You are not going to be able to change your class when the game start. There can only be one of each class in one squad.  What classes are going to be in the game? Here are some examples of the classes and what they can doFLAG RUNNERWill run faster when the player is running with the flag.Can be able to cheat with his destination, so he will not be easy to find.BUILDERWill be finding resources for the team and makes respawn points (more will be added) MEDICAre going to revive  players on the team.Revives players quicker than “regular” players who are not a medic.CRAFTSMANMakes weapons out of resources. HUNTERBeing able to track other players.MARKSMANGood with sniper.  STEALTHHas a Ghillie suit.Can't be tracked.TRAPPERMakes traps.And more will be added.  COMMUNICATIONIn the game there will be proximity type chat and proximity VoIP.Only people inside a radius of the capture points or the base are able to see the proimity chat.You cannot type with the whole team on the map.

LOOT CREATESIf you win a game, you are going to get a random skin create or a random create (not trade able items) and points. If you lose a game, you will only get some points.What kind of creates are there in the game? They have different rarity!Skin createWeapon skin createItem createWeapon createTools createThere is going to be a lot of different rarities.

Everything is fine. I am using the Starcraft 2 engine editor to make this happened so there is no problem!</p><h2>What needs to be done? Is it completed?</h2><p>No, it's not. The first thing I would like to do is<strong> adding some items. </strong>I would like to <strong>complete the skill trees for all class</strong> and <strong>add a socketed system</strong>. After that, if the monetary support is there, I would love to finish <strong>the quests and all the zones for each Act (1 to 5)</strong> and maybe add a little <strong>Act 6</strong>! :)</p><h2>How to play? Do I need Starcraft 2? When the #BETA start?</h2><p>The #BETA will start (soon). It will be accessible in the Starcraft 2 arcade for free to ANYONE.

<h2>Welcome to Tale Of A Wolf</h2>
<h3><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong></h3>
<p><strong><a href=""https://taleofawolf.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tale Of A Wolf</a> </strong>is a story driven, open world wolf adventure.<br/><br/>Set on the magical island of <strong>Sylvanna</strong>, you join Ako - an <strong>elemental </strong>wolf, who is the current <strong>guardian </strong>of the land in a struggle against the humans!</p>
<p>The core <strong>gameplay </strong>loop consists of;</p>
<ul>
<li>Exploring Sylvanna</li>
<li>Helping your fellow animals</li>
<li>Recruiting new pack members</li>
<li>Taking down human camps</li>
<li>Collecting essence</li>
<li>Levelling up your abilities and your pack members</li>

</ul>
<h3><strong><u>Demo</u></strong></h3>

<p>The demo is set in <strong>Sector </strong>4/6 of <strong>Sylvanna, </strong>has one <strong>mission </strong>available and will typically take around <strong>30 minutes</strong> to finish.  You can use a <strong>DS4</strong> controller in this version, however it is advisable to use a <strong>keyboard </strong>to enter the menu when you rename your wolf pack - I will be adding <strong>support </strong>to enter names via a joypad at a later stage.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599909955/rxhsqc8xlotlrmud3a4n.png"" src=""""/> </p>

<p>Each of the elemental forms have a unique boss linked to them, these are called the <strong>Elementals</strong>.  The <strong>Elementals </strong>were once <strong>guardians </strong>of the land themselves, until their lust for power <strong>consumed</strong> them! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598722007/dqmngaudn8rm6pblkx5x.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Once the <strong>humans </strong>have been cleared from Sylvanna, you can seek out the <strong>Elementals </strong>and unlock all of their forms &amp; abilities!</p>

<p>You don't have to attack any <strong>animals </strong>within an area, that choice is yours.</p>
<p>Will you be an <strong>apex </strong>predator or a <strong>protector </strong>of the land?</p>

<h3><strong><u>Exploration</u></strong></h3>

</div></div>","Welcome to Tale Of A Wolf
Introduction
Tale Of A Wolf is a story driven, open world wolf adventure.Set on the magical island of Sylvanna, you join Ako - an elemental wolf, who is the current guardian of the land in a struggle against the humans!
The core gameplay loop consists of;

Exploring Sylvanna
Helping your fellow animals
Recruiting new pack members
Taking down human camps
Collecting essence
Levelling up your abilities and your pack members
Rinse, repeat!
Challenge the Elementals!

Demo
You can find a short playable demo of Tale Of A Wolf for the PC here - DEMO LINK

The demo is set in Sector 4/6 of Sylvanna, has one mission available and will typically take around 30 minutes to finish.  You can use a DS4 controller in this version, however it is advisable to use a keyboard to enter the menu when you rename your wolf pack - I will be adding support to enter names via a joypad at a later stage.
 
In this demo you will have the Ice Form at your disposal, please take a look at the 'Read Me' file within the download to get an idea of the controls and attacks. 

You can also remap some controls via the in game menu.

If you have any issues or questions please feel free to join the Discord Server, it is a great little community!
Unique Features
Ako can transform into 7 elemental forms to protect the island, including fire, ice, water, lightning, earth, light and dark!  You can decide your own form at the start of the game!
Each of the elemental forms have a unique boss linked to them, these are called the Elementals.  The Elementals were once guardians of the land themselves, until their lust for power consumed them! 

Once the humans have been cleared from Sylvanna, you can seek out the Elementals and unlock all of their forms & abilities!
The Underworld
In death, your soul is separated from your body and you enter the Underworld.  You will need to absorb spirits to return back to the physical realm!

Get ready to recruit your pack, explore Sylvanna, help other animals, take down the humans and restore the natural balance!
The Game World
Environment
The game features a realistic day and night cycle already implemented, including a range of weather states. 

One moment the sun will be shining, then there could be a thunderstorm.  Be aware, wolves hunt at night, and you may end up in someone else's territory.

Hunting
Wild animals and creatures roam freely - Deers, Bears, Fish, Toads, Hedgehogs, Crab, Rabbit, Fox.  

You don't have to attack any animals within an area, that choice is yours.
Will you be an apex predator or a protector of the land?
Animals will need help on the island, keep an eye out for them as they will prove valuable along the journey. 

Scent Vision
Scent vision allows you to easily identify a target from a distance whilst slowing down time.
Each living entity has its own colour designated.

Exploration
Tale Of A Wolf isn't all about combat - there are great awards awaiting those who like to explore! Tracking scents will award far more essence that anything that you can kill on Sylvanna!

Cave System
The island includes an extensive cave system, utilising Unity's new terrain tools and allowing the playable area to be expanded dramatically.

Creatures like spiders lurk in the dark corners of the map- you have been warned!
Fire Mechanics
Tale Of A Wolf offers a destructive fire mechanic, you can pick up branches scattered around the map and set them on fire if you go to a bonfire.  
You can use fire to burn down human tents and equipment - any object set on fire, will be destroyed and there will be no way of restoring the object unless you load a previous save game.

All living things on the island are affected by fire, causing damage when coming into contact with the element.  
Human structures and equipment can now also be destroyed using magical attacks.
Wolf Pack System
There will be other wolves on Sylvanna and not all of them will be friendly. 

Prove your dominance and they will join your cause - later missions will require a pack in order to be completed. 

Human AI
Humans have set up multiple bases of operations. 
There will be an airport, shipping docks, large/medium/small encampment and stray camps to explore.
 
Each will have their own unique problem to overcome.
Use tactics to overcome the humans.  You can destroy generators used by the humans to knock out power to camps - this will turn off power to all lighting, radar and radio equipment.

With no radio, the camp cannot call for backup. 

As long as you approach an enemy from behind and they have not seen you, you will be able to perform a takedown kill which will defeat the enemy instantly.  

So who am I?
Thank you for taking the time to look at my project.  My name is Luke and I'm a developer from Oxford in the UK.  Recently made redundant due to Covid-19, I'm looking to start my career as a full time independent game developer.

Originally I was funding the project myself, however after losing my job and my son being sick in the hospital at the same time this is no longer possible. I'm now hoping for your help to finish the project on time for the December 2020 release window!

The project was a success on Kickstarter in May 2020 where it was backed by 125 awesome Wolf-Lovers.  I raised funds on Kickstarter back in May for the soundtrack and voice acting for Tale Of A Wolf.  You can see how much the project has grown since the Kickstarter campaign by checking out the updates here.

Now Tale Of A Wolf is coming to Indiegogo.  This means that if you missed the Kickstarter, now is your chance to back the project, secure a discounted digital copy and help me make my dream come true!
Please feel free to join the Discord server, I am active there every day and can answer any questions you have regarding the project.

The funding will be used to cover living expenses so that I may continue to work on the project full time until the release date.
Upon a successful campaign, I'm hoping to start my career as a full time independent game developer and I need your help to make Tale Of A Wolf the best it can be!

Risks & Challenges
Tale Of A Wolf's main features are implemented and the game is near completion.

<p>Couple of words about who we are. The core development team are three people:</p>
<p><strong>Alex Yaremchuk</strong></p>
<p>Alex has been working in games his entire career. He started as a game reviewer in the 90s but he gradually transitioned to game development and post-production. During the past 15 years he worked as a 3D animator, 3D modeler and game designer for some of the largest gaming studios in Eastern Europe. He is the art director and lead designer of Red Rust.</p>
<p><strong>Roman Yaremchuk</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://static.wixstatic.com/media/08820e_4fa74c7270ce455aa117bf08457b4128~mv2.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Roman is the lead programmer of Red Rust. In a few months he will graduate from one of the leading Universities in Prague with the major in computer programming. He had discovered his calling as a game developer when he first encountered the Unity engine! He's been working with Unity for several years now.</p>
<p><strong>Olga Bekreeva</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://static.wixstatic.com/media/08820e_e498eaf87eb04a9eb68ba3429069fb01~mv2.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Olga is responsible for a myriad of things. She does 3D sculpting for Red Rust, she does 3D fabric simulation and she will be making all the hand painted character figures you can find in the Rewards section. She is a very skilful crafts-person who's been making dolls and miniatures for over a decade. </p>
<p>Together we (and several friends we are working with) are the ArtSource Digital studio. And the funds will go towards completing Red Rust and releasing it around November 2022. So far we have been 100% self-funded and we really need your help and your support to make it to the finish line!</p>

<p>Imagine a combination of a classical beat 'em up and a Contra-style shooter. That essentially is the idea behind Red Rust. Simple concept yet polished gameplay, great art and animation and cool characters. Characters like Red!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616096082/vg4xxpmqchnlhqshzc5m.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p>
<p>Red is a ruthless KGB spy who's been chosen personally by Comrade Stalin.</p>
<p>In the year 1985 Comrade Stalin still rules over the Soviet Union as a cyborg and a beloved Secretary of the Communist Party. </p>
<p>It all begins in Berlin. Once Red lands her ballistic missile, she must locate the time machine and proceed with her <i>secret </i>mission.</p>
<p>The game consists of several time zones, and each time zone has several levels. </p>
<p>Levels in turn hold all sorts of dangers including epic confrontations with mechanical monsters!</p>

<h2>$22K – Interactive Comic Book Style Cutscenes</h2>
<p>The easiest way to show the story progression is through simple text or dialogs within the game. But a much better method would be an interactive comic book style sequences! That means producing substantial amount of extra art assets and possibly even expanding the story. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616342981/sjdnp73lz3ziwjfv7gct.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>$30K – Flying Levels</h2>

<p>Remember we were talking different gameplay situations? This is it! <br/>In the old days flying shooting levels were almost a mandatory thing for an arcade game and for a good reason: they are fun and they help to shake things up. Here you will be riding a Soviet ballistic rocket shooting enemies with your trusty Makarov pistol!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616157327/jvz7afhqeko25rds8dds.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>$40K – Driving Levels</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616157581/axz583dxhehmnsjicy0v.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>How about having a driving level as well? <font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">That is really a dream come true! Just look at the concept design. Here you will be either chasing someone or escaping from a threat, like this giant robot! That can be even turned into a crazy boss battle of </span>its<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> own!</span></font></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616157604/ademxytqyyn1hnujdfql.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>$65K – Branching Story</h2>
<p>That’s a tough one, because that complicates the level design and expands the scope of development. But it certainly adds to the replayability.  Remember how in Contra Hard Corps at the end of some levels you could choose the direction the story takes? That’s super cool, but if we want a similar thing in Red Rust, that requires more levels and a reworked story.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, we really want to do it!</p>
<h2>$75K – Printed Artbook and Soundtrack on Vinyl</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616149374/xp0urqzhhwj4iz1tauei.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The game development process generates a ton of cool art assets, like concept designs and test renderings of 3D objects and characters. It's such a shame that often in gamedev these piles of extra art end up collecting virtual dust on some hard drive somewhere. We can't have that! We are already offering a Digital Artbook as a perk, but nothing beats a physical printed Artbook. Printed artbook will have even more stuff!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616156409/tygliajzesguewidwoed.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Concept designs, character models, sprite sheets, background art. We want to publish an Artbook that will tell the tale of the development process and show the evolution of the game. </p>
<p>This won’t be just pictures, there will be stories to read in this book too. We have plenty of stories!</p>
<p>It's also a chance to contemplate the progression of the project and to see all the designs that didn't make it into the game.</p>And we are so proud of Red Rust Soundtrack that we want to have it on Vinyl with an awesome cover art!<div>
<div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616519416/us4wrkzkhghlml0u70ms.jpg"" src=""""/></div>

<p>A side-scrolling fighting game and a shooting game are two fundamentally different beasts. They have different mechanics and different pacing, but both genres are fun. We've decided to double the fun by mixing fighting with shooting in such a way that they don't upstage each other.</p>

<p>In other words there are parts of the game which are just about fighting and there are those which are about shooting. A typical Red Rust level is not just one monotonous stretch. It has a number of fighting and shooting situations and at least one boss battle (sometimes two). We put huge emphasis on bosses because we like developing and animating robotic monsters. It is tremendous fun!</p>

<p>Right now we have the prototype, it's still glitchy in some places, but we have the basic game mechanics up and running. The fighting system and the shooting system are working. Now we need to clean up the code, get rid of those bugs and create more content: more levels, more characters, more animation. </p>
<p>We plan to release the game around November 2022. Red Rust will certainly be out on Steam and Atari VCS. </p>
<p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> Red alone has about 40 individual animations already done!</p>

Red Rust is an action packed game for PC about fighting robots and travelling through time by direct orders from Comrade Stalin!
Scroll Down for Much More Information


 



Couple of words about who we are. The core development team are three people:
Alex Yaremchuk
Alex has been working in games his entire career. He started as a game reviewer in the 90s but he gradually transitioned to game development and post-production. During the past 15 years he worked as a 3D animator, 3D modeler and game designer for some of the largest gaming studios in Eastern Europe. He is the art director and lead designer of Red Rust.
Roman Yaremchuk

Roman is the lead programmer of Red Rust. In a few months he will graduate from one of the leading Universities in Prague with the major in computer programming. He had discovered his calling as a game developer when he first encountered the Unity engine! He's been working with Unity for several years now.
Olga Bekreeva

Olga is responsible for a myriad of things. She does 3D sculpting for Red Rust, she does 3D fabric simulation and she will be making all the hand painted character figures you can find in the Rewards section. She is a very skilful crafts-person who's been making dolls and miniatures for over a decade. 
Together we (and several friends we are working with) are the ArtSource Digital studio. And the funds will go towards completing Red Rust and releasing it around November 2022. So far we have been 100% self-funded and we really need your help and your support to make it to the finish line!


 


Imagine a combination of a classical beat 'em up and a Contra-style shooter. That essentially is the idea behind Red Rust. Simple concept yet polished gameplay, great art and animation and cool characters. Characters like Red!

Red is a ruthless KGB spy who's been chosen personally by Comrade Stalin.
In the year 1985 Comrade Stalin still rules over the Soviet Union as a cyborg and a beloved Secretary of the Communist Party. 
It all begins in Berlin. Once Red lands her ballistic missile, she must locate the time machine and proceed with her secret mission.
The game consists of several time zones, and each time zone has several levels. 
Levels in turn hold all sorts of dangers including epic confrontations with mechanical monsters!
 
 
 
 

$22K – Interactive Comic Book Style Cutscenes
The easiest way to show the story progression is through simple text or dialogs within the game. But a much better method would be an interactive comic book style sequences! That means producing substantial amount of extra art assets and possibly even expanding the story. 

$30K – Flying Levels

Remember we were talking different gameplay situations? This is it! In the old days flying shooting levels were almost a mandatory thing for an arcade game and for a good reason: they are fun and they help to shake things up. Here you will be riding a Soviet ballistic rocket shooting enemies with your trusty Makarov pistol!

$40K – Driving Levels

How about having a driving level as well? That is really a dream come true! Just look at the concept design. Here you will be either chasing someone or escaping from a threat, like this giant robot! That can be even turned into a crazy boss battle of its own!

$65K – Branching Story
That’s a tough one, because that complicates the level design and expands the scope of development. But it certainly adds to the replayability.  Remember how in Contra Hard Corps at the end of some levels you could choose the direction the story takes? That’s super cool, but if we want a similar thing in Red Rust, that requires more levels and a reworked story.
Make no mistake, we really want to do it!
$75K – Printed Artbook and Soundtrack on Vinyl

The game development process generates a ton of cool art assets, like concept designs and test renderings of 3D objects and characters. It's such a shame that often in gamedev these piles of extra art end up collecting virtual dust on some hard drive somewhere. We can't have that! We are already offering a Digital Artbook as a perk, but nothing beats a physical printed Artbook. Printed artbook will have even more stuff!

 
Concept designs, character models, sprite sheets, background art. We want to publish an Artbook that will tell the tale of the development process and show the evolution of the game. 
This won’t be just pictures, there will be stories to read in this book too. We have plenty of stories!
It's also a chance to contemplate the progression of the project and to see all the designs that didn't make it into the game.And we are so proud of Red Rust Soundtrack that we want to have it on Vinyl with an awesome cover art!

 
Both the Artbook and Vinyl Soundtrack (if funded) will be available for the backers at a significant Discount!

We are a small development studio based in Prague, essentially a family business and we have the vision. For many months we've been pouring every spare ounce of time and money into this project, but we can only do so much without additional financial support.
Get in touch with us directly.

We want to see it through and make sure the game does not only see the light of day but is also good. And to make this happen we need to put more focus on it. Look at all that we've done while bootstrapping, and now image what we can accomplish with your help!
We envision Red Rust as a fun and addictive action game with great character designs, snappy animation and a story which is interesting, sometimes funny and sometimes heartbreaking. 
And most importantly, we want to get the community involved in the development process of the game. 
There are perks available that let you essentially join the effort or leave a permanent mark in the world of Red Rust!
 
 

A side-scrolling fighting game and a shooting game are two fundamentally different beasts. They have different mechanics and different pacing, but both genres are fun. We've decided to double the fun by mixing fighting with shooting in such a way that they don't upstage each other.

In other words there are parts of the game which are just about fighting and there are those which are about shooting. A typical Red Rust level is not just one monotonous stretch. It has a number of fighting and shooting situations and at least one boss battle (sometimes two). We put huge emphasis on bosses because we like developing and animating robotic monsters.

We plan to release the game around November 2022. Red Rust will certainly be out on Steam and Atari VCS. 
Fun fact: Red alone has about 40 individual animations already done!
 

Boss battles are an integral part of Red Rust, because each mechanical monster not only has the potential to look really cool but also to introduce a fresh in-game situation.

Our prototype here has two shootouts with bosses and several more bosses (for other levels) are already in development.

We plan to have one or two boss battles per level (depending on what we can afford). Each one is presented as a 3D character, meaning that it has to be designed, modeled and animated.

Get in touch with us directly.
 

We went with somewhat unusual combination of 3D characters and hand-drawn backgrounds for the majority of levels.  Red Rust is a heavily stylised game with bright colors and we wanted  it to look like an interactive cartoon. 

2D backgrounds are not only more expressive than 3D, they also allow us to produce and test levels quicker. And we want to have a reasonable number of levels.
All characters are manually animated (no motion capture) and even the effects are mostly hand drawn!

 

Music is the soul of any game, we firmly believe that! Especially a game with any type of narrative. To make sure Red Rust has a soul we joined forces with two amazing composers: Michael Sobin and Roman Jelínek.

Michael wields an electric guitar and he does tracks with plenty of drive and ton of character (check out his YouTube channel where he does amazing covers of retro game music). And Roman (he composed main theme for the title screen) makes music which is cinematic and more lyrical.

OWN tournaments within your café!<span></span>

<span><span></span></span><b>GET A BETTER
RETURN FOR YOUR INVESTMENT! </b>Better quality technology &amp; a
swankier ambience for your café, will fetch you more money, more gamers &amp;
more money per gamer. </li>

<p><b></b></p>
<div style=""color: #ff3300;""><b><u>How do I
upgrade the café?</u></b></div>
<p></p>
<p><b>THIS INVOLVES
SIMPLE BUSINESS MECHANICS: </b>To begin
with, earn money from visiting gamers, use up the initial capital to set up the
café and progress in the game thereon, based on earning more money from
visitors, hiring gamers to play &amp; win tournaments, beautify the café and so
on.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<div style=""color: #ff3300;""><b><u>This seems
like a lot of work (&amp; fun), do I get any help?</u></b></div>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Yep, of
course you do! Bring in a <b>super-efficient manager </b>based on his scouting
and gaming attributes. [You get one manager at a time. If you are not happy
with his skills, you can fire him and hire another one. <u>Remember you are the
boss, ALWAYS!]</u> (See video for reference).</li>
<li>
<b>Sponsors:</b> Based on the reputation of
you café, you can attract some kick-ass sponsors<span>  who will not just bring  in investment meant for, say, land expansion
but also improve the brand worth of your café.</span><br/>

how do I hire gamers and form my E-sports team?<br/><br/></u></div></b>
<ul>
<li>
<span><span></span></span><b>SCAN GAMER
PROFILE: </b>Each gamer who visits your café, has a profile that
indicates his/her attributes. Based on this you can hire any gamer/s and form a
team for playing games of various genres.<span></span>
</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span><b>HIRE BASIS
YOUR GENRE PREFERENCE:</b> Attributes
of a gamer imply how well he is playing games of different genres. (See image
below for reference) E.g. a gamer may be awesome at arcade games, but may not
do so well in racing games.<span></span>
</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span><b>THERE IS
SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE! </b>Each gamer
can play across as many as 6 gaming genres, that are, Arcade, Sports, Racing,
RTS, FPS &amp; MOBA.<span></span>
</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span><b>TRAIN, FIRE,
HIRE GAMERS</b>: As the game progresses,
you can train your gamers on different games. If you are not satisfied with a
gamer’s performance, you can always hire a new one. (We promise there will be
plenty of talent out there!)</li>
<li>
<b>MULTIPLE TEAMS:</b> Not just one team, You can
have as many as SIX teams, one for each genre.<br/>

Tycoon is an addictive game where you manage & customize a gaming café that
is exclusively owned by you. It is a Simulation Role Playing Game (RPG)/ tycoon
game. 


You
get to play the role of a manager who not just hires gamers to play tournaments
(amateur to pro-level) but also handle a cafe; equip it with the latest PCs,
gaming consoles, arcade machine etc.


If
you loved Game Dev Story, then this is *the* game for you!


What
do we mean by upgrading the café?
You
get to upgrade the following:


PC with CPU, monitor, PC games & Gaming Gear;


Gaming
consoles with model type, TV, games & gaming gear;


Lounge Area: 



Update your space to better
& more comfortable PC chairs, console couches & couches in the waiting
area.
Apart
from this, you also can update the lounge area with a little snack bar that
also has a soda machine and yummy treats.
It
doesn’t stop here. Make your café look beautiful with funky posters on the
walls. For gamers who are waiting to use the café, can engage themselves on
various arcade machines that you can upgrade your café with.
As
if this wasn’t awesome enough, you can even expand the area occupied by your
café, as the game progresses. (Think 2 to 3 PC/ consoles , 1 arcade
machine, Vs. 20 PC / consoles, 2 snack bars, 5 arcade machines &
a plethora of gamers waiting to get into your café!)


But
why should I upgrade my café?



REPUTATION: Upgrading
your café will improve the reputation of your café amongst gamers & fans
alike.


HOST
TOURNAMENTS: Initially
when you hire gamers, they will be able to play tournaments hosted by
international gaming associations. But, as your café expands, you can hold you
OWN tournaments within your café!


GET A BETTER
RETURN FOR YOUR INVESTMENT! Better quality technology & a
swankier ambience for your café, will fetch you more money, more gamers &
more money per gamer. 


How do I
upgrade the café?

THIS INVOLVES
SIMPLE BUSINESS MECHANICS: To begin
with, earn money from visiting gamers, use up the initial capital to set up the
café and progress in the game thereon, based on earning more money from
visitors, hiring gamers to play & win tournaments, beautify the café and so
on.

This seems
like a lot of work (& fun), do I get any help?


Yep, of
course you do! Bring in a super-efficient manager based on his scouting
and gaming attributes. [You get one manager at a time. If you are not happy
with his skills, you can fire him and hire another one. Remember you are the
boss, ALWAYS!] (See video for reference).

Sponsors: Based on the reputation of
you café, you can attract some kick-ass sponsors  who will not just bring  in investment meant for, say, land expansion
but also improve the brand worth of your café.



Awesome! So
how do I hire gamers and form my E-sports team?


SCAN GAMER
PROFILE: Each gamer who visits your café, has a profile that
indicates his/her attributes. Based on this you can hire any gamer/s and form a
team for playing games of various genres.


HIRE BASIS
YOUR GENRE PREFERENCE: Attributes
of a gamer imply how well he is playing games of different genres. (See image
below for reference) E.g. a gamer may be awesome at arcade games, but may not
do so well in racing games.


THERE IS
SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE! Each gamer
can play across as many as 6 gaming genres, that are, Arcade, Sports, Racing,
RTS, FPS & MOBA.


TRAIN, FIRE,
HIRE GAMERS: As the game progresses,
you can train your gamers on different games. If you are not satisfied with a
gamer’s performance, you can always hire a new one. (We promise there will be
plenty of talent out there!)

MULTIPLE TEAMS: Not just one team, You can
have as many as SIX teams, one for each genre.






We, at Resurrection games
completely believe in the idea of providing our audience with “Value For
Money”. 

While some of our users
may like the game idea instantly, some may not be swayed with it almost
immediately. (We do hope to woo all of you!) 
We do not want our dear
users to spend on a game that they may not be entirely convinced with.
That’s why we
bring you the COMPANION APP. This is a
completely FREE to play game that we will be releasing, so as to provide
users with a preview & taste of the real E-Sports tycoon game!

So what does
this companion app entail?


You get a room,
instead of a whole café.


You get to
create 1 gamer at a time, hire him; train him by making him play games.


Raise the ranking of the gamer and sell
the gamer for a great price, and earn money.


Not just
this, but you can see the tournaments being played by the gamer you
sold, and his performance level.


You can also buy
games, gaming gear, upgrade consoles etc. & decorate your room as you
like and make it look funky.







Who buys my
trained gamer?



Users of the
full game, E-sports tycoon, buy your
gamer basis his performance, to form a team and play in the tournaments.


You need to train
and sell a minimum of 5 gamers – to form a team and upgrade your role to
that of a manager.


But
tournaments can be hosted only in the full game.


Not just
this, but you will also get a % share of rewards as earned by gamers you
have sold with respect to whether they win in the tournaments.


That’s not
all. The gamers hired, trained & sold by you, can
compete at the International Level and still be the no. 1 team in the world!


Tentative
Feature: We are planning
an in-game conversion of a ""Gamer Tycoon"" user to ""eSports
Tycoon"" for a certain in-game money in ""Gamer Tycoon"".





WE BELIEVE, THE SKY IS
THE LIMIT! And we prove it to you right here, with our expansion plans.

Own cafes around the
world and mark this as just the beginning. Yes, our expansion plan is as BIG
and as GRAND as it gets!!

Key features
of expansion plan: 



E-SPORTS
TYCOON GOES “SOCIAL”! Trade gamers
amongst your friends & compete with a friend’s team in tournaments.


BUY GAMING
CAFES AROUND THE WORLD: Conquer the
international gaming scene by becoming the richest tycoon in the history of
E-sports!


HOST
INTERNATIONAL GAMING EVENTS:  As the game progresses you will be vested
with the power of hosting the biggest gaming events all around the world!




At Resurrection Games, we are firm believers of
Electronic Sports and naturally we advocate gaming as a real career opportunity
for young gamers around the world.
E-sports tycoon is our way of bringing to life, what
we TRULY believe in.
We want the users to experience what it is like to
manage a team of gamers, to bid on talented gamers, make them compete or stick
to business by making their café one of the best in the gaming world.
OUR DREAMS FOR THIS GAME DO NOT END HERE. We are a
true believer in E-sports and feel that it can be looked at as a viable career
option for avid gamers. While in our home country this may be at a nascent
stage, but in most other nations, E-Sports are being widely accepted as an
actual sport event with gamers enjoying the status of a celebrity within the
gaming community.
This is why we need YOUR HELP, in raising money to
bring this game to life.
Of course, we have a number of ATTRACTIVE PERKS for
you, to support us in bringing this game to life.
Our unique perks are all about connecting with the
game by being an in-game character, registering your personalized clan,
deciding how the cafe should look or to host a custom tournament which will be
played by hundreds and thousands of gamers.
We are a
small team and we carry the same risks of all small game studios: Lesser
visibility and fewer marketing avenues.However, we
also carry the strengths of a small start-up: Less overhead, no
hierarchy and most importantly, passion for our game to see it through to
completion and beyond.

In case, we
fail to achieve the targeted funds:

Development
time may increase.
Art style may
be subject to change

We call upon all eSports
fans to support us so that we can make it bigger than EVER!!

for providing us with a platform to launch this campaign from India with the
least complications. We would also like to call upon kickstarter backers,

Resurrection
Games is a small, 3 member game studio founded in
Mumbai, India by former employees of the game industry. After years of working
for other corporations and studios, we have decided to embark on our dream
project: E-Sports Tycoon: The Game. 


We LOVE RPGs,
business simulations, and pixel art!
We wish to
release this title as we think it’s really a cool one and nothing like this
has been ever done before!

Being avid
gamers, we think of promoting gaming with a game, when we think of
E-Sports Tycoon.
We are already
in prototyping stage and are working ahead. But as there is more to finish
the product, we need funds to cover other aspects like sound, extensive
art/animations to survive this production stage.

We ask for
your help to meet our goals and help us
achieve the true vision we have for the entire E-Sports franchise.
We are also collaborating
with Gary Lucken from Army of Trolls fame, on the art front. With Gary's 19
years of experience in Pixel art and his love for video games, we feel we have
found the right person to make it look exceptionally retro!

You will learn something new on every voyage. I have been an avid fisherman since the age of six. Now I mainly Kayak fish in the gulf of Mexico along the emerald coast. I have spent nearly  20 years perfecting this fantastic new board game. This has been a labor of love. Everyone that enjoys ""Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness"" should put this game on their bucket list. Please support this endeavor and make it a reality. Play a round of TagandReelease and you'll be hooked for life.Thank you to all the pirates , wenches and big-game angler's throughout the world that love to fish and support my project.  Tight Lines and Calm Sea's , Robert Martin",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">My name is Jimmy Lei, and I am the lead developer for Studio 99, an indie game studio based in the state of Ohio in the United States.  After having developed two indie games for two different teams, I decided I wanted to contribute my own designs to the game industry.  Studio 99 specializes in developing games for mobile devices including the iPhone, iPad, Android and Windows platforms.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I've always believed that video games, and games in general, have had the ability to impact our lives with productive results.  Through them, we've taken up the role of the hero, reminding ourselves of the power of right over wrong, learned humility in victory and defeat by competition, and created lasting memories with our loved ones.  Games have always been an integral part of our identities, and we intend to make ours with the responsibility to this legacy in mind.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">The Project</h3>
<p>As you've gathered from the story above, your goal as the empowered seals is to protect the pod by repelling berserk sea creatures.</p>
<p>The outstanding feature of this game is the ability to play with a partner on the same device.  To this end, we've dedicated extra attention to developing controls that are comfortable for two players.  In addition, gameplay will be tuned to foster cooperation and support.  Technology has given us processor speeds that are now fast enough, and screen sizes that are now detailed enough to freely experiment with the idea in true indie fashion.</p>
<p>The gameplay, at its core, qualifies this title as an active defense game.  The enemies will move toward the seals on their paths, and you intercept them by moving your finger to attack with your seal in real time.  You complete a stage when you successfully defend the pod, and you must try again if you don't.  You'll also be able to choose how your seals will develop their abilities as you advance through the game.</p>
<p>The game is being developed with C# and Unity, a game development platform that significantly improves our workflow and build stability.  Currently, the game engine is 60% complete, concepts are at 75%, and assets sit at 10% completion.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Why It's Worth It</h3>

<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>As with most industries, innovation both sustains and improves the standard. Today, the mobile game market is saturated with carbon copies and updated classics.  While these products have a place, I feel that it is time for independent game developers to take risks and generate unique experiences.  When I founded Studio 99, it was with this exact promise...to dedicate myself to producing ""creative fun.""</div>
<h4>And...</h4>
<div>We chose the little harp seal pup as this project's mascot to stand for the humane treatment of animals.  We recognize and respect that the Canadian government has made progress to limit seal hunts over the years.  Even so, the innocence of these animals still serves as a powerful lesson for the sanctity of all life.  We've also included, as an optional perk, our own pledge to donate to an animal rescue center on your behalf.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>How Your Donation Will Help</h3>
<div>To date, I have invested my own funds and full attention to the project over the course of the past ten weeks.  Now it's your opportunity to give us the chance to continue our commitment.  If our campaign goal is met, the donations we receive will be used as follows:</div>
<div><ul>
<li>
<b>1,900</b> for regular living expenses during production per month for four months</li>
<li>
<b>630</b> for equipment including a backup storage device and tablet for our artist</li>
<li>
<b>840</b> to cover crowdfunding costs like credit card fees</li>
</ul></div>
<p>Donations that take us past our campaign goal will be used towards improved equipment, software licenses, and future content.  Also, take the time to explore the perks we're offering--they all come with the ad-free version of our game.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about donations, perks, or other topics, feel free to contact us!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
<p>We intend to challenge ourselves with an aggressive schedule, and although we ask for four month's worth of funds, we expect to release our game in a half year from the conclusion of this campaign.  To give you a more concrete idea of our plans, the following is a list of targets by month:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>game engine complete / playable build available</li>
<li>major art assets finished</li>
<li>reward system framework and user experience (UX) in place</li>
<li>title and other menus complete / begin designing stages</li>
<li>stages and enemy AI set / most assets completed</li>
<li>complete game final look and feel / final testing phase</li>
</ol>
<div>Since we are a very small team, individual schedules and setbacks present a unique obstacle to production consistency.  It also means that member must spend the time to be more meticulous for a professional product.  However, after having seen our progress since the game's inception, I'm confident that our dedication will bring another quality title to fun-loving people everywhere.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Finally, to honor your own confidence in us, I'll be posting regular updates and material as the campaign continues.</div>

About Us
Greetings!
My name is Jimmy Lei, and I am the lead developer for Studio 99, an indie game studio based in the state of Ohio in the United States.  After having developed two indie games for two different teams, I decided I wanted to contribute my own designs to the game industry.  Studio 99 specializes in developing games for mobile devices including the iPhone, iPad, Android and Windows platforms.
I've always believed that video games, and games in general, have had the ability to impact our lives with productive results.  Through them, we've taken up the role of the hero, reminding ourselves of the power of right over wrong, learned humility in victory and defeat by competition, and created lasting memories with our loved ones.  Games have always been an integral part of our identities, and we intend to make ours with the responsibility to this legacy in mind.

The Project
As you've gathered from the story above, your goal as the empowered seals is to protect the pod by repelling berserk sea creatures.
The outstanding feature of this game is the ability to play with a partner on the same device.  To this end, we've dedicated extra attention to developing controls that are comfortable for two players.  In addition, gameplay will be tuned to foster cooperation and support.  Technology has given us processor speeds that are now fast enough, and screen sizes that are now detailed enough to freely experiment with the idea in true indie fashion.
The gameplay, at its core, qualifies this title as an active defense game.  The enemies will move toward the seals on their paths, and you intercept them by moving your finger to attack with your seal in real time.  You complete a stage when you successfully defend the pod, and you must try again if you don't.  You'll also be able to choose how your seals will develop their abilities as you advance through the game.
The game is being developed with C# and Unity, a game development platform that significantly improves our workflow and build stability.  Currently, the game engine is 60% complete, concepts are at 75%, and assets sit at 10% completion.

Why It's Worth It
While the advent of smartphones has connected us to each other in remarkable ways, we must be careful not to forget the benefits of face-to-face interaction; we've all noticed when others pay a little too much attention to their phones.  Rather than fight progress, however, I feel that we should find ways to embrace it properly.  I want to create something that will fit into the catalog of games that brings friends and family together.  Thus, I decided to design our game to encourage these shared experiences.


As with most industries, innovation both sustains and improves the standard. Today, the mobile game market is saturated with carbon copies and updated classics.  While these products have a place, I feel that it is time for independent game developers to take risks and generate unique experiences.  When I founded Studio 99, it was with this exact promise...to dedicate myself to producing ""creative fun.""

Since we are a very small team, individual schedules and setbacks present a unique obstacle to production consistency.  It also means that member must spend the time to be more meticulous for a professional product.  However, after having seen our progress since the game's inception, I'm confident that our dedication will bring another quality title to fun-loving people everywhere.

Finally, to honor your own confidence in us, I'll be posting regular updates and material as the campaign continues.

<p>Klepto is a game that Nate and I (Matt)
have been planning over the past year and we’ve recently dove full force into development. We've assembled an amazing team of 3D artists to help us on this massive undertaking. However, there’s still a TON of work necessary to build up the extensive
library of interactive and lootable assets so we've decided to reach out to you, the community to help speed things up.</p>

<p>100% of this campaign funding is going into this game, not in our pockets. The whole team has agreed to a revenue based payment model where we all earn our keep from the sales following a successful launch of this game. This keeps development costs to the absolute minimum. </p>
<p>The primary use of funding from this campaign will be put towards building a vast library of interactive and lootable 3D assets for the game. The remaining portion will be reserved for marketing the release.</p>
<p>We have some very talented artists on the team but the amount of custom modeling and texturing work needed will be extremely time consuming without this financial support. However, even if this funding campaign is unsuccessful, we will still be bringing the completed project to market. However, this will negatively impact the timeline by a significant amount.<br/><br/></p>

Klepto - Steam Greenlight Page




Campaign Summary

Klepto is a game that Nate and I (Matt)
have been planning over the past year and we’ve recently dove full force into development. We've assembled an amazing team of 3D artists to help us on this massive undertaking. However, there’s still a TON of work necessary to build up the extensive
library of interactive and lootable assets so we've decided to reach out to you, the community to help speed things up.



Funding
100% of this campaign funding is going into this game, not in our pockets. The whole team has agreed to a revenue based payment model where we all earn our keep from the sales following a successful launch of this game. This keeps development costs to the absolute minimum. 
The primary use of funding from this campaign will be put towards building a vast library of interactive and lootable 3D assets for the game. The remaining portion will be reserved for marketing the release.
We have some very talented artists on the team but the amount of custom modeling and texturing work needed will be extremely time consuming without this financial support. However, even if this funding campaign is unsuccessful, we will still be bringing the completed project to market. However, this will negatively impact the timeline by a significant amount.

Note: For a more in-depth look into the
project, visit our Steam Greenlight Concept page. 
Klepto allows players to acquire a
variety of items using less-than-legal means. The single-player campaign is
broken down into three skill tiers; Amateur, Semi-Pro & Professional.
Progression through each tier unlocks all new features and gameplay mechanics.
Amateur: An opportunist with a limited
tactical skillset who relies on brute force and quick grabs.
Expert: A veteran of the craft who
utilizes disguises, tools and other techniques to skillfully gain entry into
target homes. 
Professional: A master in the art of
unlawfully acquiring profitable goods. Skilled players of this tier will
utilize high tech tools and real-world hacking techniques to use home security,
surveillance and automation systems to their own advantage.

<p>Did you know that there are less than 3300 Black Faced
Spoonbills left in the world! These beautiful creatures not only have to deal
with the dangers of a perilous migration every year but also suffer from
habitat destruction by humans. Luckily  something is being done to combat this,
wetland conservation areas that have been maintained along the migratory path
offer a safe haven for these birds to rest on their journey. With Featherman we
aim to not only raise awareness about the plight of these endangered birds but
also make people aware of the excellent conservation work that I being done to
help them. By making in game purchases a percentage of this money goes directly
to conservation efforts in order to help increase the numbers of these special
birds.</p>

Above: The evolution of our design process so far!

    The Impact 
Did you know that there are less than 3300 Black Faced
Spoonbills left in the world! These beautiful creatures not only have to deal
with the dangers of a perilous migration every year but also suffer from
habitat destruction by humans. Luckily  something is being done to combat this,
wetland conservation areas that have been maintained along the migratory path
offer a safe haven for these birds to rest on their journey. With Featherman we
aim to not only raise awareness about the plight of these endangered birds but
also make people aware of the excellent conservation work that I being done to
help them. By making in game purchases a percentage of this money goes directly
to conservation efforts in order to help increase the numbers of these special
birds.

Risks & Challenges  
While we have known each other for almost a year this is the
first game we’re making together. In order to make sure we are not over
ambitious or over estimating our capabilities we have been running to a tight
planning and development schedule. Using the SCRUM method of development we
have progress meetings every day and bigger sprint meetings every 2 weeks with
internal deadlines to ensure we stay on target.    Other Ways You Can Help If you can't donate but still want to help us that's fine too! You can follow us on social media either on:

Short Version
We're a tiny indie game startup with big dreams in Jerusalem, Israel. So far we are two guys: one Canadian-Israeli Jew, one American Christian (see short bios below). We have two games published on iOS and Android (get them here for free) and others on the way. We're trying to raise enough money to hire a graphic designer to take this project to the next level and get closer to our long-term goal:




The long-term goal of Beace Games is to build a quality game studio in Jerusalem where Christians, Muslims and Jews work side-by-side, as cooperative partners designing and building cooperative games together. Beace Games.


 Who We Are



Gilan Israel is a web programmer originally from Vancouver, B.C., Canada. In his day job he works as a front-end web programmer for a small company. He would rather be making computer games full-time. He lives in Jerusalem with his patient wife and their obnoxious cat.


Bill Burdick is interested in things that are neato, like lazy evaluation and new ways to interact with programs. And tabletop role playing games and stuff. Originally from Des Plaines, Illinois, he lives in Jerusalem with his patient wife and their gigantic dog.



Bill and Gilan work on a hardware problem

The Impact
This campaign is a tiny starting point. If successful, it will get us one step closer to the ultimate goal of building a quality game studio in Jerusalem where Christians, Muslims and Jews work side-by-side, as cooperative partners designing and building cooperative games together.


Our first published game - Holmes Cryptic Cipher (free on iOS and Android)

Our Vision 
Beace Games is a team of two indie programmers trying to make smart games for smart people. We are currently doing this in our spare time with zero budget.
But there's more to it than that. We specifically want to make peace games, not war games. 
Too many popular games today are about shooting as many people as possible, or conquering the world. Don't get us wrong. We occasionally enjoy those games as well. But it's a greater challenge and a greater calling to create games that:

make you think

promote cooperation over combat

tell compelling and unique stories with positive messages
feature realistic strong women and minorities not as afterthoughts, eye candy or DLC but as integral parts of the vision
prefer character, storytelling, complex strategy or quality puzzles rather than flashy graphics and over-the-top sound effects and explosions


And what better place to build a company with such a vision than Jerusalem? There is so much potential here, with a culturally-diverse and well-educated population. There is a high-tech scene but it is small, dwarfed by Tel-Aviv just an hour away. The long-term goal of Beace Games is to build a quality game studio in Jerusalem where Christians, Muslims and Jews work side-by-side, as cooperative partners designing and building cooperative games together. Beace Games.





What We Need (First Steps) We need about $500 US to pay fair wages to a graphic artist so that we can:



make our games less ugly and more user-friendly
make our website pop instead of making your eyes bleed
get our games noticed by people who will enjoy them instead of those lucky enough to stumble upon them in the great morass that is iTunes


What You GetDid I mention we currently have zero budget? We will thank and acknowledge every backer by name (unless requested otherwise) on our website. We will also give you space in our Beace Tower page - a linkable block of pixels which you can design however you want, whether it be your name, an advertisement, or simply a link to your own website.

thank you for taking the time to read about my company and thank you for
considering pledging. My Name is Reid Wilson. I am currently
going to college for a major in economics and a minor in business. I am 21 years
old and video games, comics, memes, YouTube videos, and artwork have all been a
very huge part of my life. I have seen many people try and try to make their
ideas work and yet they fail to become popular even though their work is
amazing. There are just some unknown variables that can keep someone from
gaining popularity. With my website I aim to help popularize these videos,
artwork, comic writings, and even manga. The website is for all sorts of
gamers, but is not limited to the gaming community. Cosplayers that are not
based off gaming characters would still be able to come to the site if they
need some help gaining recognition for their hard work.</p>
<p>      When you pledge for my website you
will be helping me break down the greatest barrier to entry in any business
setting. This is known as the start up cost. I am a college student and like
most college student I have little money, and your pledge will help my dream
become reality sooner. The pledges will go to networking, server, marketing,
domain name, and start up costs. My goal is $1500 which I feel can be easily
met, however if my goal is not met the money goes right back to you and there is
no worry.</p>
<p>      There are
always risks and challenges when created a brand new business; however with
your help and your pledges I believe that I will be able to overcome them. I am
a very hard working person and have been going to college to learn the techniques
to create a very successful business. With my vast knowledge and hardworking
skills, combined with your pledges I believe that my website will become
reality. </p>

will not regret it, and please help get the word out there for me, share this

<p><b>Precepts™</b> is officially the Bible’s Game version! Technically speaking, the premise for the Precepts™ game design is that the challenge of attempting to spell Bible words with letter tiles drawn randomly brings to players’ memory Scripture passages that had previously been read. </p>

<h3><b>The New Precepts™ App.</b></h3>
<p>The concept of the Bible in a game genre received commendation from my friends at its conception and continued support and encouragement through the 6 years of developing the idea and eventual efforts to bring the game to the public. The current version of <b>Precepts™</b> Crossword Puzzle is a physical box with card-bound board and game pieces.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Pursuant to the intention of taking God’s word to the place of interest of game lovers, developing the electronic version of the game – <b>Precepts™</b> App – became necessary. This is to make the game accessible to a global audience. The campaign on Indiegogo is to enable friends, family and members of the public who subscribe to the cause contribute towards the actualization of the <b>Precepts™</b> App project.</p>

</div></div>","It's Here! The Bible is now a Game!We have lost the attention of today's youth and even adults to the noise and chatter of the modern world. Our kids are stuck to social media, apps and games; parents are stuck to emails and the hectic schedule of life. Although the importance and immense benefits of Bible reading in our spiritual experience cannot be overstated, the discipline of Bible study has lost its appeal to many Christians. The Bible appears to have essentially fallen to the class of ""boring"" stuff.Thankfully games still have our attention. Whether we are playing for fun as a pastime hobby, or we are taking part in a competition, the evolution of mobile devices has made games even more important part of our lives. However, Bible game developers have failed to meet the expectations of lovers of God’s word for a recognized game genre.Precepts™ is finally here to change that!



Unprecedented
Bible Experience!

Precepts™ offers players a gamified Bible experience that makes the routine of Bible reading fun and interesting. This newly invented Bible game is inspired by the thought of taking the Bible to the place of interest of youths – games.
Precepts™ is officially the Bible’s Game version! Technically speaking, the premise for the Precepts™ game design is that the challenge of attempting to spell Bible words with letter tiles drawn randomly brings to players’ memory Scripture passages that had previously been read. 

The Design of Precepts™ game environment is truly inspired by the Holy Book!









The First-ever Gospel Sport is Evolving!
Ultimately the goal of this unconventional ministry is the evolution of a novel brand of gospel sport, very similar to the Scrabble Championship that will stimulate and sustain the study of the Bible and help participants to grow in the faith. Find below pictures from a pilot competition – The Precepts™ Maestro’s Treasure Hunt held 2013 in Lagos Nigeria, with the collaboration of the Christian Broadcasting Network CBN engaging 16 Teens Churches in the first-ever Bible Knowledge Competition using Precepts™ to test their Bible intelligence. 







The New Precepts™ App.
The concept of the Bible in a game genre received commendation from my friends at its conception and continued support and encouragement through the 6 years of developing the idea and eventual efforts to bring the game to the public. The current version of Precepts™ Crossword Puzzle is a physical box with card-bound board and game pieces.

Pursuant to the intention of taking God’s word to the place of interest of game lovers, developing the electronic version of the game – Precepts™ App – became necessary. This is to make the game accessible to a global audience. The campaign on Indiegogo is to enable friends, family and members of the public who subscribe to the cause contribute towards the actualization of the Precepts™ App project.
In a world that has gone largely digital, a board game in a physical box is obviously out of tune with current trend. The physical board will still be available though, for those who prefer the traditional card-bound board game with game pieces.
The new Precepts™ App will offer lovers of God’s word the opportunity to stay connected to the Bible wherever they are. Precepts™ App will be made available FREE in mobile platforms such as iPhone, iPad, Windows phone and tablet Android phone and tablet.

<p><span>We decided to add two extra development phases to bring MySquad to a wearable modality. Should we reach our first goal (65.000$) we will have the chance to work on the interface implementation for a SmartWatch so that Location, Objective, Compass, Status and Alerts will be directly available on your wrist.</span></p>
<p>Should we reach our second goal (85.000$) an Augmented Reality (AR) interface will be developed and you will be able to view all the details and the info related to the game in Real-time, while you frame the environment with your Smartphone, or while you move your gaze, directly on your eyes, through Smart Glasses!</p>In Augmented Reality <i><b>your entertainment experience will totally addictive!</b></i>

</div><div> <p></p>
<p>„Dungeon Slayer“ ist ein Mittelalter
Fantasy Hack and Slay in der Iso-Perspektive. Gesteuert wird mit den Tasten
WASD oder einem angeschlossenem Gamepad Controller. Auf Tabletts wird mit einem
virtuellem Joystick gespielt.</p>
<p>In “Dungeon Slayer” muss der Spieler
seinen Charakter durch verschiedene Dungeons steuern. Auf seinem Weg durch die
Dungeons trifft er auf unterschiedliche Gegnertypen und muss diese bekämpfen. Je
nach Schwierigkeitsgrad, welchen der Spieler selber einstellen kann, erhöhen
oder verringern sich die Schwierigkeitsgrade der einzelnen Dungeons. Dies
erfolgt in prozentualen Schritten je nach Einstellung.</p>
<p>Das Spiel besteht aus mehreren
„Akten“. Jeder Akt hat vier normale Dungeon Level und ein Endboss Level. Der
Spieler muss jeden Dungeon der Reihe nach durcharbeiten um in den Endboss
Dungeon zu kommen. Erst wenn der Endboss bezwungen wurde, schaltet sich der
nächste Akt frei.</p>
<p>Die einzelnen Dungeons können nach Abschluss
immer wieder wiederholt werden.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Der
Spieler steuert in Iso-Perspektive auf Windows Geräten seinen Charakter mit der
Maus und Tastatur oder mit dem Gamepad. Auf Android Geräten und Tablets steuert
der Spieler mit einem virtuellen Controller.</p>

From an isometric point of view, you can control your character using standard hotkeys like WASD or a connected gamepad. A virtual joystick is used on tablet platforms.<p>In ""Dungeon Slayer"" the player has to guide his charactor through various dungeons. On his way he encounters various types of enemies he has to fight. Depending on the difficulty setting, which can be configured by the player, the dungeons become more demanding. The difficulty can be set on a percentage basis.  </p>
<p>The game features of multiple ""acts"". Each act consists of four conventional dungeon levels and a single endboss level, which can be reached by completing the preceding levels. The next act unlocks once the endboss of the previous act is defeated.</p>
<p>Of course, every single dungeon can be repeated after finishing them once.</p>

<h3>Warum Dungeon Slayer?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Als unser erstes größeres Projekt, haben wir uns für dieses Spiel entschieden, da es eine leicht verständliche Mechanik hat und - aus unserer Sicht - auf längere Zeit gesehen der Spaßfaktor erhalten bleibt. </p>
<p>Das Spiel ist sowohl für zwischendurch wie auch für längere Sessions geeignet. Es läuft auf Mobilen Geräten und auf allen Windows PC`s.</p>
<p>Durch verschiedene Highscores, Ladder Systeme und den Errungenschaften im Spiel, bieten wir dem Spieler ein gutes und langes Spielerlebnis.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why Dungeon Slayer?</b></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p> Being our first larger project we decided on this game because of its simple mechanics and a, from our perspective, lasting fun factor.</p>
<p>The game is suitable for both, short and long sessions and runs on mobile devices and all Windows PCs.</p>
<p>Various highscores, ladder systems and in-game achievements we provide a fun and lasting experience.</p>

<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Was bekommst du für dein Geld? </h3> <p>Wir könnten jetzt sagen du bekommst <b>DAS</b> Mega Game. <b>Das</b> Spiel des Jahres, einen mega <b>Trippel A</b> Titel den es so noch nie gab.</p>
<p>Aber das wäre gelogen. Was du hier bekommst ist viel Besser. Du bekommst unser erstes Spiel als einer der Ersten. Du kannst in der Entwicklungsphase bereits an diesem Spiel teilnehmen und es durch deine Meinung verbessern. Als Spieler kannst du Bugs Reporten die in der nächsten Versionen entfernt werden. Du kannst Vorschläge unterbreiten wenn dir etwas nicht gefällt oder nicht ganz stimmig ist. <b>DU </b>siehst das Spiel vom Grundstein (Alpha Phase) bis zum Release in allen Versionen (als Alpha Tester). <b>Du</b> bist teil dieses Spiels und der Community.</p>
<p>Aber wofür benötigen wir das Ganze Geld fragst du dich jetzt sicherlich. Dass können wir dir schnell und einfach erklären.</p>

<ul>
<li>6000,00 Euro schlucken die Lizenzkosten.</li>
<li>4000, 00 Euro gehen für 3D Modelle und 2D Grafiken drauf.</li>
<li>3000,00 Euro kommen auf Sounds und Musik.</li>
<li>1000,00 Euro werden für den Grundaufbau der Homepage, Server und Infrastruktur der Datenbankserver verwendet.</li>
<li>1000,00 Euro als Backup für eventuelle Ausfälle oder zusätzliches Equipment.</li>
</ul>
<div>Der Beginn der Entwicklung ist nicht erst nach dem Ende der Kampagne. Wir starten ca. eine Wochen nach Kampagnen Start mit der Entwicklung unseres Spiels. In dieser Woche werden wir noch die letzten Systeme fertig einrichten und auf die Produktionsumgebung anpassen.</div>

<p><b>What do you get for your money? </b></p>
<p><i>We would be able to say you receive that Mega Game. The game of the year or a game you have never been seen before. </i></p>
<p><i>But that would be not true. What you will get here is much better. You get our first game as one of the first. You can already participate in this game in the development phase and change it through your opinion. As you can player brace reports which become remote in versions nearest to that. You can submit propositions if you do not like something or is not very consistent. You see the game from the beginning (alpha stage) up to release in all versions (as alpha testers).

Wir die IaSfC (Innovative appSolution for Companys) sind ein in 2015 gegründetes Startup Unternehmen. Das Gründungsteam besteht aus zwei ehemaligen Games Programming Studenten und einem Executive Master of Business Administration(Inhaber). Aus unserer Leidenschaft für Spiele und programmieren, haben wir es uns zur Aufgabe gemacht, Spiele zu entwickeln mit:
- sauberen, simplen und für jeden leicht verständlichen Mechaniken, egal ob auf Mobilen Geräten oder High End Rechnern.- anspruchsvolle und komplexen Mechaniken und
Spielhandlungen. Tiefgreifenden Storys und dynamischen Welten.
Who we are and what`s our intentions.
We, the IaSfC (Innovative appSolution for Companies), are a startup founded in 2015. Our founders comprises 2 former Games Programming students and an Executive Master of Business Adminstration (owner). Out of passion for gaming and programming we set ourselves the objective to develop games with:

- clean, simple and easily comprehensible mechanics, be it on mobile devices or high end PCs.
- challenging and complex mechanics, deep stories and dynamic worlds.


Kurzbeschreibung des Spiels.
 
„Dungeon Slayer“ ist ein Mittelalter
Fantasy Hack and Slay in der Iso-Perspektive. Gesteuert wird mit den Tasten
WASD oder einem angeschlossenem Gamepad Controller. Auf Tabletts wird mit einem
virtuellem Joystick gespielt.
In “Dungeon Slayer” muss der Spieler
seinen Charakter durch verschiedene Dungeons steuern. Auf seinem Weg durch die
Dungeons trifft er auf unterschiedliche Gegnertypen und muss diese bekämpfen. Je
nach Schwierigkeitsgrad, welchen der Spieler selber einstellen kann, erhöhen
oder verringern sich die Schwierigkeitsgrade der einzelnen Dungeons. Dies
erfolgt in prozentualen Schritten je nach Einstellung.
Das Spiel besteht aus mehreren
„Akten“. Jeder Akt hat vier normale Dungeon Level und ein Endboss Level. Der
Spieler muss jeden Dungeon der Reihe nach durcharbeiten um in den Endboss
Dungeon zu kommen. Erst wenn der Endboss bezwungen wurde, schaltet sich der
nächste Akt frei.
Die einzelnen Dungeons können nach Abschluss
immer wieder wiederholt werden.

Der
Spieler steuert in Iso-Perspektive auf Windows Geräten seinen Charakter mit der
Maus und Tastatur oder mit dem Gamepad. Auf Android Geräten und Tablets steuert
der Spieler mit einem virtuellen Controller.

Specification:

""Dungeon Slayer"" is a Hack and Slay game in a medieval fantasy setting. From an isometric point of view, you can control your character using standard hotkeys like WASD or a connected gamepad. A virtual joystick is used on tablet platforms.In ""Dungeon Slayer"" the player has to guide his charactor through various dungeons. On his way he encounters various types of enemies he has to fight. Depending on the difficulty setting, which can be configured by the player, the dungeons become more demanding. The difficulty can be set on a percentage basis.  
The game features of multiple ""acts"". Each act consists of four conventional dungeon levels and a single endboss level, which can be reached by completing the preceding levels. The next act unlocks once the endboss of the previous act is defeated.
Of course, every single dungeon can be repeated after finishing them once.




Warum Dungeon Slayer?

Als unser erstes größeres Projekt, haben wir uns für dieses Spiel entschieden, da es eine leicht verständliche Mechanik hat und - aus unserer Sicht - auf längere Zeit gesehen der Spaßfaktor erhalten bleibt. 
Das Spiel ist sowohl für zwischendurch wie auch für längere Sessions geeignet. Es läuft auf Mobilen Geräten und auf allen Windows PC`s.
Durch verschiedene Highscores, Ladder Systeme und den Errungenschaften im Spiel, bieten wir dem Spieler ein gutes und langes Spielerlebnis.

Why Dungeon Slayer?

 Being our first larger project we decided on this game because of its simple mechanics and a, from our perspective, lasting fun factor.
The game is suitable for both, short and long sessions and runs on mobile devices and all Windows PCs.
Various highscores, ladder systems and in-game achievements we provide a fun and lasting experience.


   Was bekommst du für dein Geld?  Wir könnten jetzt sagen du bekommst DAS Mega Game. Das Spiel des Jahres, einen mega Trippel A Titel den es so noch nie gab.
Aber das wäre gelogen. Was du hier bekommst ist viel Besser. Du bekommst unser erstes Spiel als einer der Ersten. Du kannst in der Entwicklungsphase bereits an diesem Spiel teilnehmen und es durch deine Meinung verbessern. Als Spieler kannst du Bugs Reporten die in der nächsten Versionen entfernt werden. Du kannst Vorschläge unterbreiten wenn dir etwas nicht gefällt oder nicht ganz stimmig ist. DU siehst das Spiel vom Grundstein (Alpha Phase) bis zum Release in allen Versionen (als Alpha Tester). Du bist teil dieses Spiels und der Community.
Aber wofür benötigen wir das Ganze Geld fragst du dich jetzt sicherlich. Dass können wir dir schnell und einfach erklären.


6000,00 Euro schlucken die Lizenzkosten.
4000, 00 Euro gehen für 3D Modelle und 2D Grafiken drauf.
3000,00 Euro kommen auf Sounds und Musik.
1000,00 Euro werden für den Grundaufbau der Homepage, Server und Infrastruktur der Datenbankserver verwendet.
1000,00 Euro als Backup für eventuelle Ausfälle oder zusätzliches Equipment.

Der Beginn der Entwicklung ist nicht erst nach dem Ende der Kampagne. Wir starten ca. eine Wochen nach Kampagnen Start mit der Entwicklung unseres Spiels. In dieser Woche werden wir noch die letzten Systeme fertig einrichten und auf die Produktionsumgebung anpassen.

What do you get for your money? 
We would be able to say you receive that Mega Game. The game of the year or a game you have never been seen before. 
But that would be not true. What you will get here is much better. You get our first game as one of the first. You can already participate in this game in the development phase and change it through your opinion. As you can player brace reports which become remote in versions nearest to that. You can submit propositions if you do not like something or is not very consistent. You see the game from the beginning (alpha stage) up to release in all versions (as alpha testers). You are a part of this game and the community.
But for what we need the money? - ask you certainly. We can explain fast and simply 
6000,00 Euro for licence costs
4000, 00 Euro for 3D models and 2D graphics
3000,00 Euro for sounds and music
1000,00 Euro for the basic configuration of the home page, server and infrastructure of the database servers.
1000,00 Euro as a backup for possible failure rates or additional equipment.
The beginning of the evolution is not only after the end of the campaign. We start approx. one weeks with the evolution after of our game campaign getting started.In this week, we will still arrange the last systems installations and adapt them into the production invornment.

   Die Folgen von niedrigerem oder höherem Budget. Auch bei niedrigerem Budget werden wir alles daran tun das Projekt zu realisieren. Lediglich die Entwicklungszeit wird sich dadurch verlängern, nicht aber die Qualität.

The results of lower or higher budget
In case of a lower income, we will do everything to finalize the project. Only the term  of development will takes more time - but not our quality.
If we get more than a start capital of 15.000,00 Euro we will further develop with more features. Then we push up the quality. Particular in the qualtity of the music, the sounds or the 3D models.
Every Euro that we get more  is been invested directly in the game and the infrastructure in order to make it even better for you players.
If we get 50.000,00 Euro, we open the fourth platform. iOS evolution is very expensive through Apple and its price policy. Therefore we would have to by the complete equipment as well as the software for the development.
   Die größten Herausforderungen für uns Als größte Herausforderung sehen wir das Cloudsystem, dass es euch ermöglicht - sofern ihr auf mehreren Plattformen unser Spiel spielt -  eure gespeicherten Spielstände zu übertragen. Weiterhin ist die KI und das Netzwerk Modul eine Große Herausforderung. Allerdings haben für alle drei Bereiche einen Spezialisten.

Bei erreichen der 50.000,00 Euro, wird es eine Herausforderung, alle Systeme auf iOS Kompatibilität zu portieren. Das ist selbst für uns Neuland aber eine Herausforderung, die wir mit Freude annehmen.

Our biggest challenges 

For us the biggest challenge is the cloud system which allows the player to transfer his saved games to multiple platforms if he chooses to do so. Furthermore, AI and the network module are major challenges. However, one of our programmers is specialized in network programming and another one in algorithms and artificial intelligence to meet these challenges.
Once we reach a funding milestone of 50,000 Euro we will face the challenge of porting the game's systems for iOS compatability. This is new ground for all of us but we will gladly take this challenge.

<p>Magnetizing an entire army can be a slow and painful process, so much so that many wargamers simply don't do it at all. But they would still like to have their miniatures magnetized. Many of you have probably been searching for a simple solution, some of you have just struggled through. But take heart, because we have recently developed a solution that allows for the convenient and fast magnetization of your miniatures. The entire process only consists of putting your miniature on a scenic base and placing it on a movement tray. It's that fast and easy! It doesn't get simpler than that!<br/><br/>Should you also be convinced of the necessity for such an innovative magnetization system, then you can choose from several different backing options. You can find additional details and information about this project here on this site. Together with your support we will be able to provide a wide variety of scenic bases, further improving the overall quality of our hobby.<br/><br/>We would also like to show our support for the 9th Age project by creating scenic bases specific for the different factions.</p>

But they would still like to have their miniatures magnetized. Many of you have probably been searching for a simple solution, some of you have just struggled through. But take heart, because we have recently developed a solution that allows for the convenient and fast magnetization of your miniatures. The entire process only consists of putting your miniature on a scenic base and placing it on a movement tray. It's that fast and easy! It doesn't get simpler than that!Should you also be convinced of the necessity for such an innovative magnetization system, then you can choose from several different backing options. You can find additional details and information about this project here on this site. Together with your support we will be able to provide a wide variety of scenic bases, further improving the overall quality of our hobby.We would also like to show our support for the 9th Age project by creating scenic bases specific for the different factions.

Ask about the Secret Perk!   The Impact & Development process!

This is a preview of the UI in the game...


Here we have The Pause button at the top left hand corner, Bottom left shoes power ups & booster bottoms, Top right show distance amount, Bananas collected (coins) & the player profile with the last score.
Ingame character:
the name of this character is Billy.

This is just the Model of his creation using Unity, first character and main of the game!

Background scene & map obstacles:

 Here we have a Beach scene with rocks, trees, seats & more. This is the Map Creation Part.



Here is a illustration of Character movement for quick preview of game development process.

Here's a quick video of character being tested on the map & obstacles. Note, there will be Enhanced to make this a more appealing Game. The experience its expected to be Great.

Does it sound fun yet? How about just a bit more details, hopefully we can get this game going!

Objectives: 
Timed Run: A timer will be used for players to go against the CPU or live players to beat the best score before time runs out. Time will varies depending how long it takes a live players to fall off the map, set times will be placed to VS the CPU. 1 player can beat another or 2 players can join and play against each other. Each player will have abilities to help/prevent others from winning/loosing. (2 players max)
Knock out: Challenge a Live player to go against you on a timed game. Your role will be the blocker or the racer. The objective is to prevent one or the other from getting ahead of you or knocking them off the map. 
Role 1: Racer.You as the racer, you must race thru all challenges the blocker sets out towards you. Your path will be blocked and other abilities will be used to slow you down. You will also have your own pocketed abilities to help you get passed those obstacles.
Role 2: Blocker. Your duty is to prevent the racer from reaching their objective. You will use all of your abilities and in game obstacles to slow the racer down or completely stop them. Nature will be on your side depending on the weather and how you will use your abilities. 





In game Power ups & boosters:
Hawk Wind speed 
Runner speed ration increases for a limited time

Banana peel 
Blocker uses banana peels against runner, making the slow down for 2 seconds.

Coconut bazooka 
Uses a bazooka containing x amount of ammo to knock off player or against obstacles

Quick example image



Tsunami
Call upon a large sea wave to dramatically kicks opponent off the map (end game)

Earthquake 
Call upon earth causing destruction to dramatically stop runner for a limited time. Makes runner do certain moves to stay in map otherwise may cause knock off (game end)

Score Multiplier:This ability will increase your Score Multiplier by 1. Having a high multiplier results in those massive scores which can help place you high up the leader board.  

Nature block 
Use nature to rapidly grow roots of all sizes from a distance, creating a more complex path.
& much more!



   Risks & Challenges
Our main obstacle is resources, I am not a coder and no one does anything for free unless paid. With your help, we will jump over this Brick wall separating us from time consumption & no progress, to Progress of development and Successful Launch. Another bump on the road will be Exposure to the world, if no one knows about it, how can they be part of it? anything from all of you will do us a great mayor help. Remember, you're not just helping the development of a game, The game swore to help lives as well.
    Other Ways You Can Help Can't contribute? No problem. We still ask for another simple favor. Share us, get the word out and make some noise about us. Help us as much as you can and we will thank you in so many ways. Use the Indiegogo Sharing tools to aid you on the exposure of this Campaign. 
What if we don't reach our Goal?
As our campaign is Flex Funding, we where not able to change into a fixed funding. Any funds raised will be used towards minor development process. those who have already supported us will receive what they have pledged for & those who have shared will also be recognized by us once we come to a successful launch.

Our apps were received well, millions of users downloaded and used them but Nokia has collapsed, our personal life has given us other challenges, so app development went on pause.
Couple of weeks ago we sat together again and decided we should have given it a try again and let's see how we can grow up to challenges of modern era.
Not to mention we are planning to test the water with idea when crowdsourcing makes a multi-platform game Open Source. Something what id Software did with Doom but from the beginning...
Long story short, we have decided porting our best game, Gooble Invasion, to modern platforms and  here comes YOU who will finally judge how good the idea is...
What We Need & What You Get
 Hobbyist or not we still need some funding for this project. We do not want to be hypocrite - it takes time, we have to invest into tools and equipments for development and testing and, telling the truth, we would like to see some revenue at the end...

<p>I'm Kat, I am a co-owner of EnVision gallery, a local artist, a board game enthusiast, and a long-time admirer of Mayne Island.  I've lived on Island for nearly 4 years, and have been visiting Mayne since I was 15 years old.  </p>
<p>While playing ""Bird-opoly"" with friends, laughing at how ridiculous it is the game even existed, I thought it would be amazing to have ""Mayne-opoly"" produced in limited editions.  Not only would it be hilarious to ""buy"" sections of the island and get stuck in ""Gaol"" (our museum!  it used to be a jail!  check it out!), but it could operate as a way of getting people to know the island better, locals and visitors alike.</p>
<p>I am currently prototyping out a board on which every space (named after Mayne island locations and roads) available for purchase as a property in the game is colour-coordinated to roads on the map, and have thought up quite a few ""Community Chest""/""Chance"" cards that relate to local island businesses (which could be identified with markers on the map that coordinate to the cards).</p>
<h3>
<br/>Can we legally do this?  </h3>
<p>Yes! Monopoly was originally invented by a Quaker to ""prove the evils of capitalism"" - it is a board game in the public domain - allowing anyone to make their own version without requiring licensing rights.</p>
<p><br/>But producing a professional-level board game with so many pieces is an expensive endeavour - something that we simply don't have the extra funds to back ourselves.</p>
<p>We have priced out production through a board-game publishing company, and we're confident we can sell a minimum of 50 regular editions and 10 collectors editions.</p>
<p>We've created this page to drum up funding to get it produced, but not only do you have the opportunity to own and play the game, if you run a business on Mayne Island, you have the opportunity to help us write it into the game!   </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Not only will it cost a minimum of $1500 to order a very limited first edition run of them, but we will be putting in a fair amount of time sourcing pieces, creating the graphics, and developing the cards - it's a pretty intensive process, and we'd rather not contribute all of this time for free.</p>
<p>By contributing funding to this project, you'll be assisting a group of low income islanders to support themselves, as well as getting various perks!  Check out the list of contribution levels and see how you can pre-purchase a copy of the game,  order a deluxe collectors edition, highlight your Mayne Island business in the game, or even have your own square on the board!</p>

It was clear that the designed project would be a interesting game, but the game type yet to be clarified. “Maybe we can design small demo of Cthulhu oriented ARPG game in respect of Dark Soul”, said by Gypsum, “It will take too long to meet the deadline, I’d rather to make a phone based small game like Hearthstone which is so fantastic to challenge your intelligence” Daniel replied while still staring on his phone screen. （Fig. Prototype testing party held in Gypsum and Daniel's university.）Let’s just make something simple and fun to get rid of hundred hours to meet final boss or buying cards combination. It will be a strategy game by concerting your whole chess pieces moving steps and matching with magic spelling pace. It will provide simple fun combat for friends to play together like old day games. Now the game begins.  A meteorite falls to the ocean surrounded by the continent ""Valotha"". Dark force inside the meteorite breeding with unknown fear spreading to the whole continent. Citizens were left by the old god. People lost faith and gradually infected by dark force. Wars for survival and faith started between three guilds ""Stone Forge"",  ""Advantum"" and ""Natura"" led by three heros.Only those have patience and unbreakable will can find the final answer of the meaning of living.  Game Elements-Map/HP/Prestige point/AP(Action point)/AR(Attack range)/Birth point/Skill point/Population/Hero card/Retinue card/Skill cardRules of The Game-Two players have a separate birth point, each birth point has five grids.-Player has one hero and three other units .A total of four units.-Player takes his turn alternately. In the turn, player can summon units or use skill cards.-Unit can be summoned on the birth point, unless the unit has a special effect.-Player gets 1 skill point each time his turn starts.-Each turn can’t be finished unless the player’s population reach the requirement of 4, otherwise he should summon more units.-Player can call Command Operation on his turn.Command Operation:It includes four directions(up, down, left and right).Command operation takes action on your military. Friend units will react to the player's command according to the direction,each unit will attack the enemy stand on the grid equals to its AR(attack range) point in its direction, however they will move one grid in its direction instead if there is no enemy.

<h3>What are you paying for?</h3>
<p>The Stars of Destiny is playable now in a closed alpha due to our hard work and personal resources. We've come to indiegogo so we can finish development and take our first game to market. With a pledge to the campaign you get a pass to the closed alpha, bonuses at launch, and content exclusive to indiegogo backers! With the reward and InDemand system we'll be able to raise the funds we need while offering really fun rewards for backers.</p>
<ul>
<li>$30,000 is our goal.</li>
<li>-$20K(19.8 to be precise) will go to final engine development.<br/>The core combat logic is in the alpha. Now we need to implement the UI, HD graphics, extra characters, etc. This is a fixed cost like the others.</li>
<li>-$6K will be used for the character art, animations, and effects.<br/>Considering how expensive those things are, it's a good thing we work in that industry and work with friends! The art alone could cost more than the game sometimes! I'm hiring some help because it's hard to do most of the creative part alone. Another set of hands will be so helpful to me.</li>
<li>-$4K will be used for sound, voices, and music.<br/>Luckily I live in Southern California and have friends that do voice overs and music. This will pay for the assets we need to launch.</li>
<li>If we don't meet our goal we'll spend every dime on development to take this game to market. <strong>You've invested in us. That's something we take VERY seriously.</strong>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello all! My name is Joseph Caddell, founder and Creative Director of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs4AZSWz_tE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Studio237</a>. I racked up 8 years of experience as a 3D Artist in the games industry after graduating with a B.S. degree, majoring in Game Art &amp; Design. I also dabbled in film vfx. I’ve done everything from creating environments, lighting, effects and all the technical aspects that come with it. I’ve worked alongside skilled artists from studios such as MPC, Method Studios, Fox VFX Lab, Aaron Sims Creative, and Digital Domain. I worked from the smallest indie mobile games, to blockbuster animated feature Mouse Guard, and The Call of The Wild (2020).</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>About Vodou</strong></u></p>
<p>The Elevator pitch: “The year is 1930. In the southern United States, a black farmer (Arthur) is suffering from PTSD. Arthur Discovers Vodou and begins a journey to regain control of his mental stability and heal his dying father, in search of a better life”. It’s a 3rd person psychological horror that’s inspired by the Vodou religion (proper spelling), and HP Lovecraft cosmic horror. </p> <p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>Behind the concept (TL;DR)</strong></u></p>
<p>This game is a culmination of my personal life experiences, and my family heritage. Although we’re designing it to give players a fun and horrifying experience, it’s also very emotional, and narrative driven. I also want to find a way to show the richness of black culture in the lore. The game does not pander to social or political agendas. My vision is to balance the recognition of black culture in games, badass memorable gameplay, and deliver a rich narrative.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>The TL;DR</strong></p>
<p>The game has been in pre-production for six months, since its inception. Here’s the short and simple of our 2020 road map.</p>
<p><u><strong>June - RELEASE TEASER TRAILER:</strong></u> We’re working on making a teaser trailer for a June release.</p>
<p><u><strong>July-August - RELEASE VERTICAL SLICE: </strong></u>Ideally we would like to have a vertical slice (VS) completed by June, since the first two quarters of the year are critical for investors to make financial decisions for the year. Unfortunately since we’re short a programmer, we’ll have to trust fate that we can release it later. So anywhere between July and August we want to have a VS completed, so we can pitch for higher funding.</p> <p><u><strong>December - RELEASE ALPHA:</strong></u> By this time we should have the alpha completed and ready to send to a select group for play testing.</p>
<p><strong>Budget breakdown for 2020:</strong></p>
<p><u><strong>Gameplay Programmer/Engineer:</strong></u> Implement all gameplay mechanics and features. They need to make sure the framework of the project is shippable for current and next-gen consoles, and PC. = $4,000/month. About one and a half months of development is required for the vertical slice.</p> <p><u><strong>Music &amp; Sound Design </strong></u>- 4 new pieces of music for the game we have planned out, plus custom sound effects = $6,000</p>
<p><strong>Concept Art</strong> - We have many more environments that need to be created. Arthur’s farm/home, Antagonist place of residence, gameplay way points, local forest and places for the player to explore, and a few others without spoiling the game (all of which equal out to 15). Lastly creature designs, and  special ability animation designs = ~$6,590</p>
<p>Some parts of the funding will come out of pocket from myself. There’s obviously more detail that I have in regards to budget, but for the sake of simplicity and not to bore you, I believe this should hopefully suffice. I may come back to edit this. Of course, if you have any questions about funding, please ask! :)</p>
<h2><strong>Rewards!!</strong></h2>
<p>Those who support us receive access to the vertical slice, which is normally exclusive for investors and publishers. It's not common for vertical slices to be given to the public. Lastly, a free copy of the game when it's released. I'm thinking about signed art work, but still figuring out the legistics, since our concept artist is in Spain.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risk of this game is the potential for it to not be funded. That's the bottom line. Regardless what happens we will continue to build this game until it's finished. This isn't a one off hobby project, and we take the work we put in seriously. The plan I have for Studio237 is to become a self sustaining studio that will build creative projects for years to come...or at least until carpel tunnel takes over.</p>
<p>Funds help us accelerate production and bring more people on the team we need. With funding we can focus more hours to add features and quality to the game.  Most importantly, it can even lead to us quitting our day jobs and working on this full-time!</p>

Hello all! My name is Joseph Caddell, founder and Creative Director of Studio237. I racked up 8 years of experience as a 3D Artist in the games industry after graduating with a B.S. degree, majoring in Game Art & Design. I also dabbled in film vfx. I’ve done everything from creating environments, lighting, effects and all the technical aspects that come with it. I’ve worked alongside skilled artists from studios such as MPC, Method Studios, Fox VFX Lab, Aaron Sims Creative, and Digital Domain.

The idea is not to make a game that panders to social or political agendas. Ultimately, my vision is to balance the recognition of black culture in games, bad ass gameplay, and deliver a rich narrative.

What We Need & What You Get
The TL;DR
The game has been in pre-production for six months, since its inception. Here’s the short and simple of our 2020 road map.
June - RELEASE TEASER TRAILER: We’re working on making a teaser trailer for a June release.
July-August - RELEASE VERTICAL SLICE: Ideally we would like to have a vertical slice (VS) completed by June, since the first two quarters of the year are critical for investors to make financial decisions for the year. Unfortunately since we’re short a programmer, we’ll have to trust fate that we can release it later. So anywhere between July and August we want to have a VS completed, so we can pitch for higher funding. December - RELEASE ALPHA: By this time we should have the alpha completed and ready to send to a select group for play testing.
Budget breakdown for 2020:
Gameplay Programmer/Engineer: Implement all gameplay mechanics and features. They need to make sure the framework of the project is shippable for current and next-gen consoles, and PC. = $4,000/month. About one and a half months of development is required for the vertical slice. Music & Sound Design - 4 new pieces of music for the game we have planned out, plus custom sound effects = $6,000
Concept Art - We have many more environments that need to be created. Arthur’s farm/home, Antagonist place of residence, gameplay way points, local forest and places for the player to explore, and a few others without spoiling the game (all of which equal out to 15). Lastly creature designs, and  special ability animation designs = ~$6,590
Some parts of the funding will come out of pocket from myself. There’s obviously more detail that I have in regards to budget, but for the sake of simplicity and not to bore you, I believe this should hopefully suffice. I may come back to edit this. Of course, if you have any questions about funding, please ask! :)
Rewards!!
Those who support us receive access to the vertical slice, which is normally exclusive for investors and publishers. It's not common for vertical slices to be given to the public. Lastly, a free copy of the game when it's released. I'm thinking about signed art work, but still figuring out the legistics, since our concept artist is in Spain.
 

Risks & Challenges
The risk of this game is the potential for it to not be funded. That's the bottom line. Regardless what happens we will continue to build this game until it's finished. This isn't a one off hobby project, and we take the work we put in seriously. The plan I have for Studio237 is to become a self sustaining studio that will build creative projects for years to come...or at least until carpel tunnel takes over.
Funds help us accelerate production and bring more people on the team we need. With funding we can focus more hours to add features and quality to the game.  Most importantly, it can even lead to us quitting our day jobs and working on this full-time!

Affectionately referred to as ‘Drew’s Game,’ this amazing science fiction epic has endless possibilities in the gaming industry, transcending genera and traditional narrative pitfalls. Help us bring his stories, characters and universe to life today.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550630497/qz5cxxmxmddl4wkvztj6.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>Introduction</h3><p>            “Why don’t you just make your tabletop game, like… a real game?” My best friend asked me some time ago. It’s quite a leap from tabletop to a screen and controller, I thought, giving a list of the difficulties. “Difficult,” he said, “but not impossible.” Over some time I toiled with the idea in the background of my mind. I have a saying I tell people playing video games, particularly on the more difficult settings (I love to play a new game on its hardest setting). It tends to drive them nuts, but it is true. ‘Just make the difficult stuff easy, then it’s not so hard.’  </p><p>                I purchased a camera a few months ago for vacations, holidays and perhaps to make some instructional videos for some graphic arts techniques. I hung up the old green-screen in my kitchen and began some tests. I found myself inspired in a different way. I thought of our tabletop game and how I could make it come to life, perhaps in video shorts. Soon I had the 3d printer cranking out helmet pieces while I cut, sewed and glued fabric. My girlfriend was very curious, but I don’t like to share until I’ve really done something tangible. That weekend I invited that same friend over and, after a few beers, told him to suit up, grab a prop gun and get in front of the green-screen.</p><p>                Over the next few months I found a way to make the difficult aspects of this project manageable. It’s a disservice to call it easy, but it certainly isn’t that hard. I’ve developed techniques for using real footage in template scenes to bring to life everything that happens in our tabletop game sessions. With a little creative programming, green-screen shooting and integrating digital effects and music, I found I could create content at a rapid pace.  </p><p>                So here we are. I did what I could with my cheap camera and kitchen/studio to create this crowdfunding video. If it’s not clear that I need funding, at the very least for a quality camera and microphone, then I’ll pat myself on the back for doing what I did with what I had. I’ve assembled a team who is excited to work on this project, put together a wardrobe of costumes and shelves of prop weapons. We’ve plotted scenes, began work on digital locations and consolidated digital assets like muzzle flashes, blood spray, HUDs, energy weapon effects, creepy birds, waves of fog, rain, lightning and many, many more.</p><p>               Now I need you, now the team needs you. We need a community of like-minded people who love tabletop games and role playing games in general. If you love D&amp;D, Shadowrun, Rifts, Vampires or any other RPG, tabletop or video game, you’ll love what we’re putting together. If you loved Telltale games like The Walking Dead, the Netflix experience Bandersnatch, or narrative games in general, please donate, and we won’t disappoint. I thank you, ahead of time, for your interest and your donations. Together we can bring the spirit of tabletop, role playing games and narrative stories into the modern gaming experience. This is just the beginning, our first story together. Thank you so much for being a part of it.</p><p>                                                                                                Sincerely,</p><p>                                                                                                Andrew Gabara</p><p> </p><h2>The Story of ‘Against the Storm’</h2><p>                The world is full of light in the 2060’s. Dreams of scientific accomplishment are now everyday realities. Micro-Fusion generators now power vehicles and homes for decades at low cost and air pollution has become something of the past. Stasis technology has allowed for food supplies that never spoils, supporting the ten billion inhabitants of the planet. Affordable air travel and global communication networks allow for almost everyone to be a citizen of the world. An AI controlled financial and trade system prevents the depressions and economical crashes of the past. Medical technology has made most diseases a thing of the past, and cybernetics have restored the most grievously injured back into themselves. World governments even collaborated to create massive Generation Ships, carrying the best and brightest of the planet out into the stars explore and spread humanity beyond our delicate blue orb.</p><p>                But underneath the light of these technological wonders are the shadows of greed, conflict and ignorance. Power sources were immediately weaponized, leading to a new generation of deadly energy weapons. The gap between the super wealthy and an average citizen has expanded to usher in a new age of global oligarchs. Technologies are limited to those who can pay, and those who fail to repay their crushing debt face dire consequences. Corporations have grown to monstrous entities that topple governments and reduce stable populations to festering hovels for the sake of profit. The Generation Ships have a noble mission, but the hundreds of thousands that were selected have left organizations without their most intelligent and rational employees and operators. Nuclear war is considered obsolete, its explosions would leave nothing to be gained, so a new era of weapons has dawned. Biological weaponry, or Bios, are used to exterminate populations without damaging infrastructure. Infected humans transform into horrific mindless creatures, very effective, but proven difficult to control.</p><p>                This warped world culture was the final nail in the coffin of non-violence. World governments and corporations conspired to create mercenary forces who travel from country to country acting in whatever interests are profitable and without fear of repercussions or war crime trials. It is a violent world, most are out for only themselves, but, within the darkness, humanity remains. People still hope, still help and still cry out for peace and reason. Little did they know, a storm was on the horizon.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550709590/fw8cezndu19gmnzwockw.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>                In the spring of 2062 odd weather patterns began developing across the globe, baffling meteorologists and geoscientists. Within three days a massive super-storm formed over North America. This is the story of those who fled inward, to the eye of the storm, doing whatever they can to survive under extreme conditions. 22 years have passed since the storm formed, it remains as a circular wall of wind, trapping all within The Eye.</p><p>                During the chaos, when the storm first formed, local government, law enforcement and military stationed in the area banded together, under the guidance of the Mayor, to organize and secure safety for its citizens… at any cost. The Last City holds the last remnants of what civilization once was, sustaining thousands of innocents and protecting them from the harsh and cut-throat survivalists of the Storm-Lands outside its walls. Over the last 22 years the Mayor has warped society, now serving his totalitarian dictatorship as ‘Loyalists,’ willing to go to any extreme to sustain their way of life. The Mayor extorts those living beyond the city while forcing labor and allocating resources within the walls. You may find his acceptance of harsh realities intolerable, or join his regime to bring law and order to all of the Storm-Lands. These, and many more choices, await you in ‘Against the Storm.’</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550709572/l5dadqyo49psy9zc3leu.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h2>Stats, Skills and Abilities</h2><p>               The rules of this game balance Character attributes, Player decisions and chance. When creating your Character, or while spending your Characters earned Experience Points, you decide what Statistics, Skills and Abilities you will have.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550630409/lol3fo0yhuewytshgrbn.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>                 Stats are split into three categories, Physical, Psychological and Phenomenal. The typical human treats 3 as the average while an active, heroic or adventurous person would have 4 as an average. Hector the Enforcer has high Physical stats, even for an adventurer.  When faced with Physical challenges, Hector should overcome most with relative ease. Though he has an average Intelligence, he has great Perception (see threats coming and notice things in the environment) and above average Constitution (good memory recall, resistance to pain and psychological trauma).</p><p>                When creating a Character the player will see what bonuses they have to starting skills. Hector the Enforcer has Melee, Firearms and Environmental in his ‘+++’ starting skills category, meaning those tasks will be much easier to perform (each ‘+’ indicates a +10 bonus to that skill, so Hector begins with +30 to Melee, etc.)</p><p>                Each starting Character variant has at least two Special Abilities when beginning the game. These are often passive bonuses or changes to starting gear. We can see Hector the Enforcer has ‘Tribulant,’ which gives him additional Deflection (a Hit Point category) that grows as the game progresses. Meanwhile, his ‘Geary’ bonus starts him with a Shotgun, sidearm and a reloading kit, a powerful bonus to get the player going in the early game.  </p><h3 style=""margin-left:1.5in;""><i><u>Skills</u></i></h3><p>                There are many, many Skills that can be used in a variety of situations. Having a few points in many Skills gives you lots of options, while putting all your points into a few Skills limits your options but grants higher rates of success. Each point in a Skill represents 1% increase in your probability of success, which is swayed by difficulties, situations and other factors. There are dozens of Skills, each represents something you can do in the game. There is a Skill for everything, and everything has its Skill.</p><p>                I.E.           Athletics, Convince, Deduce, Appraise, Diagnose, Electronic Hardware, Fabricate, Repair, Masonry, Sneak, Ritual, Navigation, Traps, etc.</p><p>                Skills are also put into broader categories, in sets of three, to give perspective on their use. Some bonuses apply to everything in a category. </p><p>                I.E.           Mechanical, Spirituality, Scout, Building, Stealth, Medical, Investigation, Science, etc.</p><h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550630833/z3tfc9t0zwwpzrfxcuzb.jpg"" src=""""/>  </h3><h3>                   <i><u>Combat Skills</u></i>
</h3><p>                Combat is a major part of the game, and thus has its own set of Combat Skills. The Playable Characters in this game have a wide variety of Combat Skills allowing them to use a plethora of weapons and techniques, some quite Character specific. General Skills like Firearms have categories; Pistol, Longarm, and Repeater. Energy weapons have their own categories, as well as Melee combat skills. Some weapons fall into multiple categories. An assault rifle would be a Longarm-Repeater. A machinegun pistol would be a Pistol Repeater. This also works with Energy weapons. The laser pistol ‘Lasseter’ (seen in our Guns Showcase Video <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI3Fk9_vlAY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI3Fk9_vlAY</a>) fires a fiery beam, making it a Pistol Beam weapon. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550709447/j9wkqzkvzi0hfrak0tc0.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>                     <i><u>Abilities</u></i>
</h3><p>                Beyond your starting Special Abilities, Characters may spend EXP to learn new and exciting Combat and Non-Combat Abilities. Sometimes this requires a tutor, but most often reflect the path a Character is already following. Hector the Enforcer will have Abilities that revolve around Executions or Knocking-Out enemies, as well as passive Abilities that make it easier to confront multiple enemies, etc. Hector the Scout has options to improve travel, avoid or seek out encounters, provide special navigation during ‘Delves’ and avoid combat damage by seeking cover before a conflict even starts. Hector the Scavenger will have the opportunity to find and hold more gear, particularly ammo, as well stashing excess items in secret locations to retrieve later. These are just variants of Hector, there are many, many Abilities to be unlocked for all the Characters, allowing for lots of replay-ability, even as the same Character.</p><h2>Combat System</h2><p>               Our combat system balances reliable skill and luck of the dice. Based on a unique Tabletop experience created by Andrew Gabara, the rules of combat are complicated enough to hold depth, but simple enough to understand quickly. There are two types of combat, Battle and Resolute.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550630751/k7loxpaeavwyofbftmx0.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>                ‘Battle’ combat has a taste of the familiar turn-based strategy found in other games. Characters are all displayed on the screen with the Player Party on the left foreground and enemies on the right background (typically). Our game is unique in that all human players and enemies are created from green-screen acting, giving them a real life feel.          </p><p>                Our Action Point system allows for a new type of combat interaction. Players and enemies do not actively take turns, or wait for their turn to act. Instead, each has its own Action Points that refresh periodically and are used for all actions that character can take. Want to jump away from a grenade? That’ll take an AP. Want to fire your pistol at an enemy? AP. Re-calibrate your allies Shield system to restore some HP? That will use AP as well. Actions and abilities may have ‘Cooldowns’ and ‘Warm-Ups,’ making characters vulnerable to Counterattack and Interruptions.</p><p> </p><p>                We’ve also incorporated a range system and environmental system. Sometimes enemies and allies are behind the frontline, making them a long run to engage in melee and difficult to hit with short ranged weapons. Characters can also take cover behind objects in the terrain, giving a bonus depending on its size and durability. It’s perfectly rational to take cover from a sniper until they run out of ammo, and beats charging them like a pack of fools. You can shoot from a distance, take cover from ranged attacks and ignore cover with melee. Terrain also makes a difference, effecting how far a character can move and how effective their evasion or dodges are (particularly while wading through knee high mud). Ranged weapons can also lose effectiveness due to weather like heavy rain, fog and wind. If a wave of fog or heavy rain rolls in, characters have a chance to rush ranged enemies to close the distance. If you’re being shot at from across a muddy grove, take cover behind that nearby rock and fire back. There are even impenetrable cover locations that make you immune to ranged attacks, provided you don’t poke your head out or try to shoot back. Pausing uses an Action Point and allows your character to survey the battlefield, giving you more information depending on Perception, Skills and Abilities.</p><p>                ‘Resolute’ combat takes place in a narrative environment without strict guidelines of a Battle but following the same guidelines for success. Resolutions often have higher stakes, ending with a characters defeat or death, and changing the overall story. Resolute combat can involve stealth, a harsh turn in dialog, an escape, a hand-to-hand challenge, etc. Our Crowdfunding video gives an example of this as Hector interacts with the Mayor. Though it is not an active battle, the stakes are still life and death, and could change the path of the entire game. Resolute indeed.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550630801/okc7qdipc27xvqhufiw8.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>                Because we use live actors as character representations, we are limited in physical damage that we can show. This works perfectly with the universe and the combat system, which uses Defenses as Hit Points. Every character may have the following types of Defenses;</p><p>                Deflection: Filmed and shown as a Dodge, Evasion, near-miss or literal deflection. Despite how it is displayed, Deflection only occurs when Dodging, Evasion, Sprinting, Cover and ‘luck of the dice’ fail, thus reducing these Hit Points. Deflection is the most common and easily restored type of Hit Points, and almost always the first to take damage.</p><p>                Shield: An energy shield that absorbs damage. These are rare and wide in variety. Some only effect bullets, others are skin-tight and stop anything, there are also ‘Bubble Shield’ varieties that take damage before Deflection and are so wide they can sometimes include nearby allies. Shields also restore in different ways. Some powerful versions need to be recharged at a power source, while others slowly charge over time. The most elite Shields restore quickly and have great amounts of Hit Points, but it is rare to find one without one weakness or another… Many powerful Shields are completely ineffective versus melee.</p><p>                Barrier: A rare mystic form of defense. Gained from powerful artifacts, rituals, marks and deeds. Mystic Barriers are as wildly varying as they are difficult to acquire and maintain. </p><p>                Armor: Wide in variety and type, preventing physical damage to the character. Armor is the most common type of Defense after Deflection, and can be repaired in the field with the right skill, resources and tools. Armor can often be improved upon by raising your characters Fabrication skills. Your adventures will also lead to opportunities to make allies to furnish and repair your Armor, and there’s always scavenging and theft to fall back on.</p><p>                …and finally Health. When a character takes damage to their Health they may be injured, which gives negatives to actions. An injured character is weaker, often dealing less damage in melee and having a more difficult time hitting with ranged weapons. Injured characters may also be unable to use certain skills and abilities until healed. Often injuring a character changes combat from a Battle to a Resolute situation, giving the player more opportunities to choose an outcome that suits the narrative they’re progressing towards.</p><p>                Combat is not necessarily the core of our game, but it can be, with Delves. In a Delve, your character or group will explore a particularly violent area, filled with human foes, monstrous Bios, or dangerous mechanical enemies. Great rewards lie throughout the Delves, but at great risk. Delves hold many secrets for those able to complete them, giving the player powerful new dialog and combat options as the game progresses. Delve locations often have different versions or missions that take place within them, giving opportunities to gain more EXP, new gear and even unlock new abilities.</p><p>               Thanks for checking us out!

My girlfriend was very curious, but I don’t like to share until I’ve really done something tangible. That weekend I invited that same friend over and, after a few beers, told him to suit up, grab a prop gun and get in front of the green-screen.                Over the next few months I found a way to make the difficult aspects of this project manageable. It’s a disservice to call it easy, but it certainly isn’t that hard. I’ve developed techniques for using real footage in template scenes to bring to life everything that happens in our tabletop game sessions. With a little creative programming, green-screen shooting and integrating digital effects and music, I found I could create content at a rapid pace.                  So here we are. I did what I could with my cheap camera and kitchen/studio to create this crowdfunding video. If it’s not clear that I need funding, at the very least for a quality camera and microphone, then I’ll pat myself on the back for doing what I did with what I had. I’ve assembled a team who is excited to work on this project, put together a wardrobe of costumes and shelves of prop weapons. We’ve plotted scenes, began work on digital locations and consolidated digital assets like muzzle flashes, blood spray, HUDs, energy weapon effects, creepy birds, waves of fog, rain, lightning and many, many more.               Now I need you, now the team needs you. We need a community of like-minded people who love tabletop games and role playing games in general. If you love D&D, Shadowrun, Rifts, Vampires or any other RPG, tabletop or video game, you’ll love what we’re putting together. If you loved Telltale games like The Walking Dead, the Netflix experience Bandersnatch, or narrative games in general, please donate, and we won’t disappoint. I thank you, ahead of time, for your interest and your donations. Together we can bring the spirit of tabletop, role playing games and narrative stories into the modern gaming experience. This is just the beginning, our first story together. Thank you so much for being a part of it.                                                                                                Sincerely,                                                                                                Andrew Gabara The Story of ‘Against the Storm’                The world is full of light in the 2060’s. Dreams of scientific accomplishment are now everyday realities. Micro-Fusion generators now power vehicles and homes for decades at low cost and air pollution has become something of the past. Stasis technology has allowed for food supplies that never spoils, supporting the ten billion inhabitants of the planet. Affordable air travel and global communication networks allow for almost everyone to be a citizen of the world. An AI controlled financial and trade system prevents the depressions and economical crashes of the past. Medical technology has made most diseases a thing of the past, and cybernetics have restored the most grievously injured back into themselves. World governments even collaborated to create massive Generation Ships, carrying the best and brightest of the planet out into the stars explore and spread humanity beyond our delicate blue orb.                But underneath the light of these technological wonders are the shadows of greed, conflict and ignorance. Power sources were immediately weaponized, leading to a new generation of deadly energy weapons. The gap between the super wealthy and an average citizen has expanded to usher in a new age of global oligarchs. Technologies are limited to those who can pay, and those who fail to repay their crushing debt face dire consequences. Corporations have grown to monstrous entities that topple governments and reduce stable populations to festering hovels for the sake of profit. The Generation Ships have a noble mission, but the hundreds of thousands that were selected have left organizations without their most intelligent and rational employees and operators. Nuclear war is considered obsolete, its explosions would leave nothing to be gained, so a new era of weapons has dawned. Biological weaponry, or Bios, are used to exterminate populations without damaging infrastructure. Infected humans transform into horrific mindless creatures, very effective, but proven difficult to control.                This warped world culture was the final nail in the coffin of non-violence. World governments and corporations conspired to create mercenary forces who travel from country to country acting in whatever interests are profitable and without fear of repercussions or war crime trials. It is a violent world, most are out for only themselves, but, within the darkness, humanity remains. People still hope, still help and still cry out for peace and reason. Little did they know, a storm was on the horizon.                In the spring of 2062 odd weather patterns began developing across the globe, baffling meteorologists and geoscientists. Within three days a massive super-storm formed over North America. This is the story of those who fled inward, to the eye of the storm, doing whatever they can to survive under extreme conditions. 22 years have passed since the storm formed, it remains as a circular wall of wind, trapping all within The Eye.                During the chaos, when the storm first formed, local government, law enforcement and military stationed in the area banded together, under the guidance of the Mayor, to organize and secure safety for its citizens… at any cost. The Last City holds the last remnants of what civilization once was, sustaining thousands of innocents and protecting them from the harsh and cut-throat survivalists of the Storm-Lands outside its walls. Over the last 22 years the Mayor has warped society, now serving his totalitarian dictatorship as ‘Loyalists,’ willing to go to any extreme to sustain their way of life. The Mayor extorts those living beyond the city while forcing labor and allocating resources within the walls. You may find his acceptance of harsh realities intolerable, or join his regime to bring law and order to all of the Storm-Lands. These, and many more choices, await you in ‘Against the Storm.’Stats, Skills and Abilities               The rules of this game balance Character attributes, Player decisions and chance. When creating your Character, or while spending your Characters earned Experience Points, you decide what Statistics, Skills and Abilities you will have.                 Stats are split into three categories, Physical, Psychological and Phenomenal. The typical human treats 3 as the average while an active, heroic or adventurous person would have 4 as an average. Hector the Enforcer has high Physical stats, even for an adventurer.  When faced with Physical challenges, Hector should overcome most with relative ease. Though he has an average Intelligence, he has great Perception (see threats coming and notice things in the environment) and above average Constitution (good memory recall, resistance to pain and psychological trauma).                When creating a Character the player will see what bonuses they have to starting skills. Hector the Enforcer has Melee, Firearms and Environmental in his ‘+++’ starting skills category, meaning those tasks will be much easier to perform (each ‘+’ indicates a +10 bonus to that skill, so Hector begins with +30 to Melee, etc.)                Each starting Character variant has at least two Special Abilities when beginning the game. These are often passive bonuses or changes to starting gear. We can see Hector the Enforcer has ‘Tribulant,’ which gives him additional Deflection (a Hit Point category) that grows as the game progresses. Meanwhile, his ‘Geary’ bonus starts him with a Shotgun, sidearm and a reloading kit, a powerful bonus to get the player going in the early game.  Skills                There are many, many Skills that can be used in a variety of situations. Having a few points in many Skills gives you lots of options, while putting all your points into a few Skills limits your options but grants higher rates of success. Each point in a Skill represents 1% increase in your probability of success, which is swayed by difficulties, situations and other factors. There are dozens of Skills, each represents something you can do in the game. There is a Skill for everything, and everything has its Skill.                I.E.           Athletics, Convince, Deduce, Appraise, Diagnose, Electronic Hardware, Fabricate, Repair, Masonry, Sneak, Ritual, Navigation, Traps, etc.                Skills are also put into broader categories, in sets of three, to give perspective on their use. Some bonuses apply to everything in a category.                 I.E.           Mechanical, Spirituality, Scout, Building, Stealth, Medical, Investigation, Science, etc.
                     Combat Skills
                Combat is a major part of the game, and thus has its own set of Combat Skills. The Playable Characters in this game have a wide variety of Combat Skills allowing them to use a plethora of weapons and techniques, some quite Character specific. General Skills like Firearms have categories; Pistol, Longarm, and Repeater. Energy weapons have their own categories, as well as Melee combat skills. Some weapons fall into multiple categories. An assault rifle would be a Longarm-Repeater. A machinegun pistol would be a Pistol Repeater. This also works with Energy weapons. The laser pistol ‘Lasseter’ (seen in our Guns Showcase Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI3Fk9_vlAY) fires a fiery beam, making it a Pistol Beam weapon.                      Abilities
                Beyond your starting Special Abilities, Characters may spend EXP to learn new and exciting Combat and Non-Combat Abilities. Sometimes this requires a tutor, but most often reflect the path a Character is already following. Hector the Enforcer will have Abilities that revolve around Executions or Knocking-Out enemies, as well as passive Abilities that make it easier to confront multiple enemies, etc. Hector the Scout has options to improve travel, avoid or seek out encounters, provide special navigation during ‘Delves’ and avoid combat damage by seeking cover before a conflict even starts. Hector the Scavenger will have the opportunity to find and hold more gear, particularly ammo, as well stashing excess items in secret locations to retrieve later. These are just variants of Hector, there are many, many Abilities to be unlocked for all the Characters, allowing for lots of replay-ability, even as the same Character.Combat System               Our combat system balances reliable skill and luck of the dice. Based on a unique Tabletop experience created by Andrew Gabara, the rules of combat are complicated enough to hold depth, but simple enough to understand quickly. There are two types of combat, Battle and Resolute.                ‘Battle’ combat has a taste of the familiar turn-based strategy found in other games. Characters are all displayed on the screen with the Player Party on the left foreground and enemies on the right background (typically). Our game is unique in that all human players and enemies are created from green-screen acting, giving them a real life feel.                          Our Action Point system allows for a new type of combat interaction. Players and enemies do not actively take turns, or wait for their turn to act. Instead, each has its own Action Points that refresh periodically and are used for all actions that character can take. Want to jump away from a grenade? That’ll take an AP. Want to fire your pistol at an enemy? AP. Re-calibrate your allies Shield system to restore some HP? That will use AP as well. Actions and abilities may have ‘Cooldowns’ and ‘Warm-Ups,’ making characters vulnerable to Counterattack and Interruptions.                 We’ve also incorporated a range system and environmental system. Sometimes enemies and allies are behind the frontline, making them a long run to engage in melee and difficult to hit with short ranged weapons. Characters can also take cover behind objects in the terrain, giving a bonus depending on its size and durability. It’s perfectly rational to take cover from a sniper until they run out of ammo, and beats charging them like a pack of fools. You can shoot from a distance, take cover from ranged attacks and ignore cover with melee. Terrain also makes a difference, effecting how far a character can move and how effective their evasion or dodges are (particularly while wading through knee high mud). Ranged weapons can also lose effectiveness due to weather like heavy rain, fog and wind. If a wave of fog or heavy rain rolls in, characters have a chance to rush ranged enemies to close the distance. If you’re being shot at from across a muddy grove, take cover behind that nearby rock and fire back. There are even impenetrable cover locations that make you immune to ranged attacks, provided you don’t poke your head out or try to shoot back. Pausing uses an Action Point and allows your character to survey the battlefield, giving you more information depending on Perception, Skills and Abilities.                ‘Resolute’ combat takes place in a narrative environment without strict guidelines of a Battle but following the same guidelines for success. Resolutions often have higher stakes, ending with a characters defeat or death, and changing the overall story. Resolute combat can involve stealth, a harsh turn in dialog, an escape, a hand-to-hand challenge, etc. Our Crowdfunding video gives an example of this as Hector interacts with the Mayor. Though it is not an active battle, the stakes are still life and death, and could change the path of the entire game. Resolute indeed.                Because we use live actors as character representations, we are limited in physical damage that we can show. This works perfectly with the universe and the combat system, which uses Defenses as Hit Points. Every character may have the following types of Defenses;                Deflection: Filmed and shown as a Dodge, Evasion, near-miss or literal deflection. Despite how it is displayed, Deflection only occurs when Dodging, Evasion, Sprinting, Cover and ‘luck of the dice’ fail, thus reducing these Hit Points. Deflection is the most common and easily restored type of Hit Points, and almost always the first to take damage.                Shield: An energy shield that absorbs damage. These are rare and wide in variety. Some only effect bullets, others are skin-tight and stop anything, there are also ‘Bubble Shield’ varieties that take damage before Deflection and are so wide they can sometimes include nearby allies. Shields also restore in different ways. Some powerful versions need to be recharged at a power source, while others slowly charge over time. The most elite Shields restore quickly and have great amounts of Hit Points, but it is rare to find one without one weakness or another… Many powerful Shields are completely ineffective versus melee.                Barrier: A rare mystic form of defense. Gained from powerful artifacts, rituals, marks and deeds. Mystic Barriers are as wildly varying as they are difficult to acquire and maintain.                 Armor: Wide in variety and type, preventing physical damage to the character. Armor is the most common type of Defense after Deflection, and can be repaired in the field with the right skill, resources and tools. Armor can often be improved upon by raising your characters Fabrication skills. Your adventures will also lead to opportunities to make allies to furnish and repair your Armor, and there’s always scavenging and theft to fall back on.                …and finally Health. When a character takes damage to their Health they may be injured, which gives negatives to actions. An injured character is weaker, often dealing less damage in melee and having a more difficult time hitting with ranged weapons. Injured characters may also be unable to use certain skills and abilities until healed. Often injuring a character changes combat from a Battle to a Resolute situation, giving the player more opportunities to choose an outcome that suits the narrative they’re progressing towards.                Combat is not necessarily the core of our game, but it can be, with Delves. In a Delve, your character or group will explore a particularly violent area, filled with human foes, monstrous Bios, or dangerous mechanical enemies. Great rewards lie throughout the Delves, but at great risk. Delves hold many secrets for those able to complete them, giving the player powerful new dialog and combat options as the game progresses. Delve locations often have different versions or missions that take place within them, giving opportunities to gain more EXP, new gear and even unlock new abilities.               Thanks for checking us out!

<p>Hello Indiegogo friends! My name is Gregg Lawson, Founder and Lead Producer for Edensky Studios - A small Los Angeles based gaming company founded in 2017.</p>
<p>This campaign is to introduce our first RPG title - <strong>Dash Hounds</strong></p>
<p>Before switching to, or even the idea of creating video games remotely existed, the studio was deep into the development of 2D animated short films and pitch materials for online television platforms. We funded our animated stories and dreams through our day jobs, and more recently, some of us have even left those jobs to commit to the studio full-time.</p>
<p>We spent several years through the fascinating adventure that is developing original content within the 2D animation industry. We soon realized something about our work was missing, there was a voice within ourselves that was being suppressed. We ultimately, as a small studio, had to make the decision whether to continue pursuing 2D animation or completely follow our intuition and move forward - Even if that meant starting all over again.</p>
<p>Months after that pivotal decision we decided to strategically alter our course towards what we love most, what would better engineer our wild imaginations, and most importantly guide our Creative Compasses: Creating Video Games.</p>

<p>Using our backgrounds in animated film/television entertainment and indie development, we wondered what it would be like to develop a PC game using similar story and cinematic techniques, while utilizing game creation tools such as the Unreal Engine. The idea for Dash Hounds was conceived on the simple notion that people love, and praise dogs. In fact, we do too! </p>
<p>We then realized, what if we presented our own stories in their purest form. Our own adapted  experiences from our childhood.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Dash Hounds Story:</strong></h3>
<p>Dash Hounds is a story-driven RPG where humanity lives in a dog-centric world. After watching your best friend win their first competition, you are inspired to rescue your first dog. You and your best friend are not the only aspiring regional champions in your neighborhood, however. Your rival, who is also your neighbor, rescues the sibling of your dog and challenges you to rise to your very best. Your town’s prolific dog trainer will also have a hand in your journey to become the greatest. Your relationships with these characters will evolve with every competition and conversation.<br/>Throughout the game, you will be able to interact with the world and its inhabitants as your customized human character as well as your dog. This new ability will help you solve puzzles and complete quests as you progress through the story.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Origin Of The Name:</strong></h3>
<p>The name Dash Hounds was conceived on the notion that speed, agility, and power-up stats would be the game’s core mechanics with mini-racing challenges. It soon evolved towards the concept of a full-fledged RPG, where a much larger story about the world began to unfold. The game’s title was meant to be tentative but became the official name soon after development started.</p>
<p>The first idea for Dash Hounds spawned from a discussion with a group of friends sharing their memories and love for their own dogs. We then realized we had to share our own experiences into a game that other people could emotionally engage and connect with.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>The Game Mechanics:</strong></h3>
<p>The prominent game mechanics you can look forward to with Dash Hounds are: Cooperative Character Gameplay, Character Customization, a Mission Based Story Structure in an open world, Progression based Leveling Systems, and Mission Based Puzzle Solving through exploration and NPC Dialogue.  </p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Mission Based Puzzle Solving will encourage the player to explore this new world and see all that it has to offer.</li>
<li>For our leveling system, we decided to twist the traditional RPG stat sheet with our own made specifically with Dash Hounds in mind.</li>
<li>Cooperative Character Gameplay will have you utilizing your customized character as well as switching freely to your dog(s) to complete various tasks. This will allow both characters to work together and have their bond grow as you progress through the story.</li>
<li>Character Customization is a classic RPG staple that we want to allow you to personalize your character and dog(s) to your liking. Our goal is to have you immersed in the world and feel attached to your character and their journey.</li>
<li>We chose a Mission Based Story Structure because we love the way it is presented in the GTA series (namely the fifth) as well as Red Dead Redemption 2. This gives meaning and purpose to every mission as we can craft the story more personally around such a mode.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<h3><strong>Seasonal Releases of Dash Hounds:</strong></h3>
<p>Think of Seasons as expansions to the game.</p>
<p>The  first installment of Dash Hounds will begin in the season of Summer, and with each additional season released, more content will be available in-game to support the games progression and your journey.</p>
<p>Each Season will include content such as Character/Dog accessories, brand new maps/quests, Holiday themed events/items, and much more!</p>
<p>The best part is, there will be NO micro-transactions. Just Seasonal packs!</p>
<p> </p>

We also fill a void for people who want to adopt animals, but find the shelter environment upsetting.</p>
<p><strong>History: </strong>The Animal Protectorates was formed in 2012 to provide public education on the cruelty of puppy mills. When the city of Burbank passed legislation to stop the sale of these commercially bred animals in pet stores, The Animal Protectorates opened Operation Adopt as a way to offer animals for adoption while helping decrease overcrowding and euthanasia at local shelters by freeing up space. This legislation is now law statewide.</p>
<p><strong>Purple Collar Promise: </strong>Once The Animal Protectorates makes a commitment to an animal at the shelter, we also make a promise to him or her. That promise is that no matter when or why they lost their family, we will always be there to provide a safe place for them. This promise is represented by a symbolic purple collar which every animal receives at the shelter.</p>

My name is Gregg Lawson, Founder and Lead Producer for Edensky Studios - A small Los Angeles based gaming company founded in 2017.
This campaign is to introduce our first RPG title - Dash Hounds
Before switching to, or even the idea of creating video games remotely existed, the studio was deep into the development of 2D animated short films and pitch materials for online television platforms. We funded our animated stories and dreams through our day jobs, and more recently, some of us have even left those jobs to commit to the studio full-time.
We spent several years through the fascinating adventure that is developing original content within the 2D animation industry. We soon realized something about our work was missing, there was a voice within ourselves that was being suppressed. We ultimately, as a small studio, had to make the decision whether to continue pursuing 2D animation or completely follow our intuition and move forward - Even if that meant starting all over again.
Months after that pivotal decision we decided to strategically alter our course towards what we love most, what would better engineer our wild imaginations, and most importantly guide our Creative Compasses: Creating Video Games.
 
View our previous animated works here!
 

Meet The Team!
 
I love to find purpose in anything we find  passion in. I believe in discovering your process,  given your own creative compass, identity, and  simply listening to your intuition. I hope that our games can help educate, and have our players acknowledge and discover their own strengths and passions through our stories.
Fitness/Nutrition is vital to my energy balance  and mental state during long production days.  I use the power of music to also reset, and  relax. My journey in storytelling began with  Classic Cinema, and my favorite Pixar film is  Ratatouille!
 
Gregg Lawson - Founder & Lead Producer
 
""It's been a dream of mine to work on a video game project with the studio and now we're making it a reality. Life is full of lessons and I've been an avid student. I'm hoping to incorporate so much of what life has taught me into Dash Hounds so that each player walks away with useful knowledge to help them each day.Education is what drives me day to day. My favorite television show is Avatar: the Last Airbender because I believe it uses an entertaining medium to teach children and adults life lessons while remaining interest during every episode. Now that's something we can aspire towards!""
Joseph Vonderlinden - CoFounder & Lead Game Designer
 
""I've been drawing since the womb, probably. But I've definitely been creating art since I could firmly grasp a writing utensil in my tiny hand. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Animation, and continue to use my skills and imagination to come up with characters and illustrations that excite me. I like to find new ways to express my creativity while still remaining true to my interests in design. My hobbies include napping, sweating in the gym, playing whatever current Sims game is out, and messing around with tarot cards.""
 
 
Marie Story - Art Director
 

""Hiya! I am the goofball who will always try his hardest to make you smile.I’ve always been an avid gamer. There is a wonderful feeling when I complete an RPG after weeks or even months (or more) of digital (and real) sweat and tears. I also know more about Pokémon than most people are willing to admit.Swimming and Hiking are my favorite forms of exercise. I have a Bachelor’s in TV, Film & Media Studies as well as an Associate Degree in Broadcasting Communications. I am currently authoring my first book as the idea came to me almost 12 years ago. Don't get me started on ideas because I will never shut-up.""
Spencer Tuel - Head of Story / Editorial
 
 

 

Using our backgrounds in animated film/television entertainment and indie development, we wondered what it would be like to develop a PC game using similar story and cinematic techniques, while utilizing game creation tools such as the Unreal Engine. The idea for Dash Hounds was conceived on the simple notion that people love, and praise dogs. In fact, we do too! 
We then realized, what if we presented our own stories in their purest form. Our own adapted  experiences from our childhood.
 
The Dash Hounds Story:
Dash Hounds is a story-driven RPG where humanity lives in a dog-centric world. After watching your best friend win their first competition, you are inspired to rescue your first dog. You and your best friend are not the only aspiring regional champions in your neighborhood, however. Your rival, who is also your neighbor, rescues the sibling of your dog and challenges you to rise to your very best. Your town’s prolific dog trainer will also have a hand in your journey to become the greatest. Your relationships with these characters will evolve with every competition and conversation.Throughout the game, you will be able to interact with the world and its inhabitants as your customized human character as well as your dog. This new ability will help you solve puzzles and complete quests as you progress through the story.
 
The Origin Of The Name:
The name Dash Hounds was conceived on the notion that speed, agility, and power-up stats would be the game’s core mechanics with mini-racing challenges. It soon evolved towards the concept of a full-fledged RPG, where a much larger story about the world began to unfold. The game’s title was meant to be tentative but became the official name soon after development started.
The first idea for Dash Hounds spawned from a discussion with a group of friends sharing their memories and love for their own dogs. We then realized we had to share our own experiences into a game that other people could emotionally engage and connect with.
 
The Game Mechanics:
The prominent game mechanics you can look forward to with Dash Hounds are: Cooperative Character Gameplay, Character Customization, a Mission Based Story Structure in an open world, Progression based Leveling Systems, and Mission Based Puzzle Solving through exploration and NPC Dialogue.  
 

Mission Based Puzzle Solving will encourage the player to explore this new world and see all that it has to offer.
For our leveling system, we decided to twist the traditional RPG stat sheet with our own made specifically with Dash Hounds in mind.
Cooperative Character Gameplay will have you utilizing your customized character as well as switching freely to your dog(s) to complete various tasks. This will allow both characters to work together and have their bond grow as you progress through the story.
Character Customization is a classic RPG staple that we want to allow you to personalize your character and dog(s) to your liking. Our goal is to have you immersed in the world and feel attached to your character and their journey.
We chose a Mission Based Story Structure because we love the way it is presented in the GTA series (namely the fifth) as well as Red Dead Redemption 2. This gives meaning and purpose to every mission as we can craft the story more personally around such a mode.

 
The Conceptual Journey of Dash Hounds:

- Bubble Beach Island (Unexplored Region in Summer Expansion)

- Bubble Beach Shores  (Unexplored Region in Summer Expansion)
 

 
The demo was crafted in the Unreal Engine, and assets used are pre-existing materials to convey visually and technically what it is we'd like to accomplish in the game, whether it be mechanics, mini-game challenges, map design, and more..
 
The Conceptual Characters of Dash Hounds:
Although your personal character will be customized, below are some conceptual character designs that we originally had in mind for other trainers you may encounter on your journey! 
These characters are a very close representation of what may be visualized in the final product.



Meet Proto! Dash Hounds' un-official mascot. (He was our first 3D Prototype in the Unreal Engine when developing our demo) 
Seasonal Releases of Dash Hounds:
Think of Seasons as expansions to the game.
The  first installment of Dash Hounds will begin in the season of Summer, and with each additional season released, more content will be available in-game to support the games progression and your journey.
Each Season will include content such as Character/Dog accessories, brand new maps/quests, Holiday themed events/items, and much more!
The best part is, there will be NO micro-transactions. Just Seasonal packs!
 

 
 


Our team has completed hours of necessary research to understand the costs associated with the full development of Dash Hounds, startup studio overhead, and comprehensive tax compliance.
We believe it's very important to share with you the transparency in our budget breakdown, and what your contributions will collectively support.
The funding will not only contribute to the development of Dash Hounds, but also to secure the longevity of the studios' future so that we may be able to focus solely on making the best game we can, with the best team and resources available.
Production timeline estimates will vary depending on campaign finance success.
 

** This chart represents a fully funded campaign and a 2-year development period **
 
We also understand the realities that may occur if our campaign isn't fully funded. Below you will see financial phases in which your contributions will support and potentially speed up the development if the campaign doesn't reach it's primary goal!
 
What happens once a Phase is successfully funded?
For each Phase that is achieved, we will not only release a special bonus perk, but also additional contributions to animal facilities!
The Phases help represent the speed of production and development.

</ul><h3><strong>Why?</strong></h3><p>""Thanks for including us"" were the words from our users that launched this project aimed at bringing Dice World Audio on Alexa to the 280 million visually impaired around the world. The visually impaired like to play games just like everyone else, but the problem is their options are very limited. While there are some games designed for the visually impaired, most are simplistic with limited functionally and designed with only the visually impaired in mind.</p><p>Our games allow the visually impaired to play with their sighted friends and family without either knowing the difference. We level the playing field making the visually impaired part of the gaming social community.</p><p>Dice world has received a lot of positive feedback and lately our users are requesting Alexa games. With your help we can deploy the two time AppleVis game of the year, Dice World on Alexa. This campaign would give us the resources to create a whole new gaming experience on Alexa for both the visually impaired and their sighted friends and family. </p><p>If you have never played Dice World and want to get a better understanding of what it is about download and play today!</p><p><a href=""https://apple.co/2LCfTsk"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_200/v1544137135/h7mcxg8wlwrhtuk8cxvs.png"" src=""""/></a>      </p><p><a href=""http://bit.ly/indiegogodwdroid"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_200/v1544137168/hrrsy8zkwrnuwd7lyvkx.png"" src=""""/></a></p><p> </p><h3><strong>Impact</strong></h3><p>The impact to both us and our users will be huge.

Dice World is a fun social game with six dice games:
Yatzy           
Farkle           
Pig
Balut           
Threes           
1-4-24
Why?""Thanks for including us"" were the words from our users that launched this project aimed at bringing Dice World Audio on Alexa to the 280 million visually impaired around the world. The visually impaired like to play games just like everyone else, but the problem is their options are very limited. While there are some games designed for the visually impaired, most are simplistic with limited functionally and designed with only the visually impaired in mind.Our games allow the visually impaired to play with their sighted friends and family without either knowing the difference. We level the playing field making the visually impaired part of the gaming social community.Dice world has received a lot of positive feedback and lately our users are requesting Alexa games. With your help we can deploy the two time AppleVis game of the year, Dice World on Alexa. This campaign would give us the resources to create a whole new gaming experience on Alexa for both the visually impaired and their sighted friends and family. If you have never played Dice World and want to get a better understanding of what it is about download and play today!       ImpactThe impact to both us and our users will be huge. Many of our visually impaired users have shared how sound controlled devices have changed their lives for the better. Those conversations often end with the question, ""When are you guys going to Alexa?"". The truth is, it has been on our roadmap for some time. We have started setting up the framework, but the project has stalled due to resource constraints. Launching new products requires a substantial amount of time and money. This campaign will allow us to hire the staff required to make hands-free game play a reality for the visually impaired.We have a history of creating fun accessible games on budget and on time. We have a plan in place and are ready to execute it. This project has us super excited  and we cannot wait to give the millions of visually impaired a new and fun way to play games! And while we do everything with the visually impaired in mind, who wouldn't want to play Dice World hands-free? What We Need & What You GetIn short, we need funding. We have started this project, but need 2 additional developers to help us get it across the finish line. Once we reach our campaign goal we plan on releasing on Alexa in less than 90 days.With your contribution you will be part of something cool as well as score some sweet perks, such as:
Dice World gold
Your name on our website
Premium set of metal dice to use at home
Leather Dice World dice cup with dice
Premium Dice World set that includes leather cups, leather case, and dice

<h3>The founding story: GamrPod</h3>
<p>Help us unlock the next celebrity streamer!</p>
<p>Founding Team - Sam Speaker &amp; Dalton Carroll:  </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Sam and Dalton met at the beginning of their tenure at Temple University where they instantly found a common interest in video games.  As NCAA men's soccer players, they found that one of the best ways to spend their time outside of school and practice was to play split screen video games on their (at the time) large 30 inch TV.   </p>
<ul>
<li>Sam Speaker  - Sam graduated from Temple with a bachelor's degree in Accounting and started his career at Ernst and Young as an auditor of Fortune 500 public companies. While still at Ernst and Young, Sam connected with an owner of a startup packaging manufacturer who needed someone to open the West Coast market for the fast growing company.  Given his lack of sales experience, lack of network, and lack of knowledge of the packaging industry, Sam decided that it was just the challenge that he needed.   In less than six months, Sam successfully grew the west coast market while also inheriting the Boulder, Colorado based team.   Less than 2 years later, needing to return to the East Coast, Sam returned to Philadelphia where he resides today.   Since early High School where he had a short stint of a competitive Halo career, Sam has diligently looked for ways to break into his industry of passion, gaming.  </li>
<li>Dalton Carroll - Dalton graduated from Temple University with a degree in Media Studies and Communications with a focus in audio engineering and quickly entered the entertainment industry as a producer at the world renowned Milkboy Studio in Philadelphia.  While there, Dalton had the opportunity to meet, record, and produce for stars such as Meek Mill, Nicki Minaj, Kiesza, Flostradamous and many more.     Continuing his passion of recording music at night, over the next few years Dalton spent his days in the customer service and sales industry where he found a passion for networking and collaboration.  When he wasn't producing music, Dalton continued to enjoy playing video games.  </li>
</ul>
<p>As Sam and Dalton watched the rise of video game streamers and the simultaneous boom of Fortnite, they began to notice a trend:  streamers, esports players, and competitive gamers were moving away from affordable consoles and onto PC's.  And those top streamers were those that had extremely powerful PC's that could output over two hundred frames per second without any lag at high resolution.  At the same time, the count of new streamers entering twitch was doubling year over year.  That's when the investigation began.   The influx of new streamers was riddled with low quality, low resolution, no face cam, low ping productions that drew little to no viewers.  That's when reality hit, kids wanted their shot at becoming the next big streamer but are using under powered rigs to do it.   Perhaps the next Ninja or DrDisrespect was stuck behind a low quality production?</p>
<p>GamrPod gives new and prospective streamers a place to grow their stream and community without the need to spend thousands of dollars on a PC and streaming setup.   For veteran streamers, GamrPod's are available when they are away from their home rigs while travelling allowing them to stay in touch more frequently than ever before.  </p>
<p>GamrPod is fully equipped with a high end PC, peripherals including web cam and microphone, a green screen, the most popular games and broadcasting software.  GamrPod's will be found at local esports and gaming facilities where staff will able to assist in stream setup and maintenance.  GamrPod's are able to be reserved by the hour through an internet based reservation system.  </p>

<p><strong>Where the funding going:</strong> Be transparent and specific-people need to trust you to want to fund you.  Our proof of concept GamrPod is currently in production with a local esports facility identified and verbally committed to be its home.  With several other local gaming and esports facilities interested, this funding will be used to help us build additional GamrPods in effort to get GamrPods deployed and available for use as quick as possible as interest for streaming stations is growing daily.  </p>
<p><strong>Our Unique Perks:</strong>  We wanted GamrPod's to be state of the art, eco friendly, and comfortable.  </p>
<ul>
<li>High End PC: Intel Core i&amp;-8700K processor &amp; Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080</li>

She looked like an ice-cold snowflake and indifferently floated into Fujiwara Hiro’s heart. It seemed like a romantic beginning.</p><p>Miyazawa Moe looked pretty and had outstanding grades, but was very cold and detached. Her classmates did not welcome her, and did not develop close relationships with her. However, her talent and beauty touched Fujiwara Hiro, whose family had already been broken. Furthermore, she also seemed to regard Fujiwara Hiro as someone unique. He couldn’t help but feel moved by Miyazawa Moe, but it was just that when he tried to get close to her, he found that it was really too difficult to get close to this girl.</p><p>At the same time, Fukihara Reika, a charming girl with a warmhearted smile, also had a chance encounter with Fujiwara Hiro.</p><p>She was outgoing and magnanimous, had a warm personality, and was also a bit bizarre, which gave Fujiwara Hiro a feeling he had never previously experienced. Fujiwara Hiro was obviously attracted to Miyazawa Moe, while Fukihara Reika’s vitality and uninhibited personality as well as her enthusiasm may have caused other people to see her as stubborn and unyielding. However, Fujiwara Hiro thought that Fukihara Reika was just like an angel opening up her wings in front of him.

Some of them may meet again, while others may never see others again.Secrets that are covered by rapidly falling snow are interwoven with a sorrowful rhythm. Broken families,Experiences of bullying,Tears concealed by smiles.Is the taste of first love sweet or bitter?

She looked like an ice-cold snowflake and indifferently floated into Fujiwara Hiro’s heart. It seemed like a romantic beginning.Miyazawa Moe looked pretty and had outstanding grades, but was very cold and detached. Her classmates did not welcome her, and did not develop close relationships with her. However, her talent and beauty touched Fujiwara Hiro, whose family had already been broken. Furthermore, she also seemed to regard Fujiwara Hiro as someone unique. He couldn’t help but feel moved by Miyazawa Moe, but it was just that when he tried to get close to her, he found that it was really too difficult to get close to this girl.At the same time, Fukihara Reika, a charming girl with a warmhearted smile, also had a chance encounter with Fujiwara Hiro.She was outgoing and magnanimous, had a warm personality, and was also a bit bizarre, which gave Fujiwara Hiro a feeling he had never previously experienced. Fujiwara Hiro was obviously attracted to Miyazawa Moe, while Fukihara Reika’s vitality and uninhibited personality as well as her enthusiasm may have caused other people to see her as stubborn and unyielding. However, Fujiwara Hiro thought that Fukihara Reika was just like an angel opening up her wings in front of him. Fukihara Reika’s warmth and radiance sparked enthusiasm and hope within Fujiwara Hiro, who seemed to treat others with kindness, but actually was afraid of interacting with others. Fukihara Reika was too enticing for him. He couldn’t hold himself back, and was fatally attracted to her.On one side was the unapproachable ice-cold beauty, and on the other was the unfathomable elfin girl.His heart drifted between these two girls and remained indecisive.How could he choose between them and make sure that it was the right decision?Irie KenjiIdentity: Fujiwara Hiro’s father, Fukihara Reika’s stepfatherAge: 40Occupation: Film ProducerCharacter Description:Several years ago, Irie Kenji wanted to have a romantic life with Fujiwara Kayoko.

However, because he was dissatisfied with Fujiwara Kayoko’s obsession with her work, the two of them always got in arguments. Afterwards, he had an affair and they ultimately divorced. One year later, he lived with Fukihara Reika’s mother. Since his marriage had failed, he excluded and felt disappointed in his son Fujiwara Hiro, especially after he found that his son had had an improper relationship with his adopted daughter Fukihara Reika. Irie Kenji thought that this was Fujiwara Kayoko’s way of getting her revenge after the breakup of their marriage.Preview of some Background Art:Our company ""Pureworks"" is currently working hard to develop ""White Wings"", which is a new visual novel-based game that we will be launching.

Either could be used to really help with the world building component.I am programming, animating, writing, and designing the graphics for this game myself, as well as doing some of the OST. As such, most of the money will be for my own living expenses as well as to be used to buy new hardware and software to speed along the development process. Needless to say, some of the money is for fees and taxes regarding the product as well. Everything else will go to audio: both music and voice acting!The game should be finished by May of 2017.Mayfly's inability to fight is actually a very important part of her character which has to do with the inception of the original Glass Wing. The driving thought behind the constitution of Mayfly was ""Is it possible to play with the 'Damsel in Distress' trope to see what kind of adventure someone in peril who is far too weak to fight might save themselves?"" And as such she originally only managed to escape her captor not by strength, skill, or even wits, but sheer luck. Of course, since she is forced to go on the adventure that's the point where she starts to become something more, but never really a ""hero"".",37.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Hi, we're a design duo who have created multiple products around the world and are now trying our hands at creating a card game that will make you hate 2016 all over again (in the best way possible). We have also teamed up with amazing gaming industry experts, who have brought 'Magic' to a lot of people's lives, to make it happen annually.   </h3>
<p>For many of us in this generation, 2016 has been considered one of the wierdest years in our recent Sapien timeline. From Brexit to Trumpism to Harambe, it seemed like bad juju was all around-- and no one could have seen it coming. That is why it is important that you fund this campaign unless you’re a masochist (or actually want to do better by this world this year by remembering and learning from all the things that went down in 2016). With your contributions, you’ll help bring to life a game that is a surprising memory refresher about all the current events that went down last year, especially for those who--for the most part--have attempted to move on forever. So ask yourself, are you ready for that commitment? If so, click the destiny you’d like to choose.</p>
<h3>The Game</h3>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483820840/iwecpendunvmfwiehswb.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>

<p>First, gather your open-minded friends and loosen up with drinks.</p>
<p>Each round, someone (the ""cardmaster"") will act, draw or rap the card they pick. You get 30 seconds to prep for your presentation, so that means you get to google that event on your phone if you need to. All the rest of the people do is guess that event. The first person to guess correctly wins that card. If you get 10 cards, you win the game!</p>

<p><strong>Plot Twist: </strong>There are also good event cards! We know! We couldn’t believe anything good came out of 2016 either! These cards are marked with a green thumbs up symbol at the bottom. If a cardmaster draws a good event, the first person to guess correctly wins DOUBLE points!</p>

<p>We also have a drinking guide for this game, because sometimes it’s easier to handle bad news when it comes with a pint of beer.</p>

<div><h3>The Impact</h3></div>
<div>
<p>When you fund <strong>F*ck 2016 The Game</strong>, you fund the possibility of capturing history. 2016 was considered one of the worst years (for everyone interested in playing this game anyways). We experienced some tragic events that showed a world that many of us didn’t recognize, a world we had previously assumed was steadily moving towards progress. A lot of not-quite-as-tragic-but-still-news events happened (like Kim Kardashian’s robbery) and by virtue of living in the age of social media, much of our history was defined by trending tags around popular stories. All of this matters to how we remember our years.</p>
<p>By funding this campaign, you’ll help encapsulate all the noteworthy things that happened and yes, make light of shitty situations, but also never forget that we are built from our shared history and need to learn from the past. These cards spark conversations and remind us that dialogue makes history, and that we can learn from each other as well. When we played this game with a group of friends, we witnessed at least five conversations about current events triggered by questions like: ""Oh, what happened with that?"" or ""I didn't know that went down!"" Perhaps by funding this game, you’ll help people in the world #educatethemselves. Sometimes the only way to move forward and get people’s attention about the things that matter (and sometimes don’t matter) is to inject humor in it.</p>
<p>If this works, we can continue to capture moments in history onwards, so that they don’t die as trending tags but live on as active discourses feeding movements, as lessons and as portraits into the world we live in. Maybe one day, you’ll have five years worth of history in a shit-talking deck of cards that you can pull out whenever you need a refresher on all the things we can work on changing in the world.</p>
</div>
<h3>Our Ask</h3>
<p>We are raising $10K to create an abomination of a game that will be all funs and will sharpen your current events knowledge. Most of the funds will go into the creation of this game, but a portion of the funds will also be donated to two organizations supporting education in underserved communities and homeless youth. We’ll chat more about the organizations we’re excited about supporting below.</p>
<p>If we are able to hit $100K in funds, we will also develop a mobile app and a site to submit all the events you hate (or love) about 2016, 2017 and every year onwards. You will even be able to add your own custom cards for your groups of friends or family! This will be a game that can be continuously updated until death do us part. ""How can you create an awesome game so easily!?"" You might be wondering. We have a solid design and development team with years of UI/UX and engineering experience that will tailor the best app experience for you and all parties onwards.</p>

<h3>A Portion of the Proceeds Go To Some Amazing Nonprofits</h3>
<p>It’s not all (not) fun and games! We’ve spent some time working in education development and with underserved youth, and these are things we’re really passionate about. We want to be sure our little game is doing some good in the world, so we will be donating a percentage of the funds to two organizations:</p>
<p>DonorsChoose.Org: “We make it easy for anyone to help a classroom in need, moving us closer to a nation where students in every community have the tools and experiences they need for a great education.”</p>
<p>NAEHCY: “The National Association for the Education of Homeless Children and Youth (NAEHCY) is a national membership association dedicated to educational excellence for children and youth experiencing homelessness. Through state and federal policy and technical assistance to our members, students, and the public, we change systems so all children and youth can learn, succeed academically, and achieve their dreams.”</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are fully invested in this idea, and have made all of the partnerships to deliver this awesome “f*ck you” to 2016. We’ll be working closely with distributors to check card quality, packaging, and logistics to ensure that this is delivered on time. Since we are currently in the concept stage, the biggest challenge is hitting our contribution goal. Ideally we would love to reach at least 10k so that we can get a steady streamlined printing and packaging process going, and know exactly how many to push to print.</p>
<p>We are also working with industry experts who have built board games and card games that have added ""Magic"" to many peoples lives; as well as successful campaigns launchers on Indiegogo and Kickstarter. Under their tutelage, we are carefully mapping timelines and logistics so that you get your game as soon as possible.</p>

<p>We are a design duo, coming up with all things creative, fun and (hopefully) long-lasting. Matt is the founder of NOMA Creatives, a design and development agency that has worked with clients large and small; and is the co-founder of Raddish, an app that helps you find plant-based meals, made fresh from your neighbors.

<p>In case you didn't catch the cheeky humor and are thinking, ""these two aren't serious about this game"".

The issues we see today have been brewing for years. Nowadays, developers often have to search high and low to hopefully find the resources they need. The indie devs of today spend countless hours looking for help and resources when they could be spending time working on their games. They often lack a “Home” to call their own and are forced to rely on themselves. We believe the indie community deserves better.<br/> </p><p>Home Of Nerds was founded in 2016 by James Harris, Emily English, and a handful of others, who are passionate about gaming in general. James has been running various large projects of this caliber for many years, and also has 10 years experience in the web development/design field, along with our other mature graphic design and development team. We started by creating our own news platform from scratch - <a href=""http://www.homeofnerds.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.homeofnerds.com</a> - which is aimed at the community and is not just another generic news site. Within our community, we have created a hub on our official Discord partner server with over 1600+ indie developers, who chat about all sorts of topics and get help daily with their projects. The reason behind starting the Home of Indies project is that we see first hand the lack of help, advice, and resources that are available to independent developers. We see talent go to waste on a daily basis - either through lack of funds or lack of direction.<br/> </p><p>With the contributors’ help, we will provide a platform that will assist developers as never before. By working closely with sales experts and market leaders, we will provide an extensive step by step resource center which will consist of easy to follow guides on every aspect of indie development and marketing. By providing these resources, devs will no longer need to spend hours looking for help on difficult subjects. The most recent and up to date guides for every subject important to indies will be right at your fingertips and we aren’t stopping there.<br/> </p><p>Home of Indies will enable developers to craft their own professional custom websites with very little effort, for free. This allows each developer to have a professional webpage that of studio quality and is individual to them. The customizable widgets will allow indies to add any features they feel will help their development in the industry. We don’t just give you a profile. We give you the tools to build your own professional studio. However, Home of Indies will be much more than just an indie gaming website builder. That is not our only focus. We are striving to provide everything indie developers need to be successful. We are helping developers succeed in all phases of creating a game; including the need for a simple yet feature packed website.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489743597/zkshrkkjysz3kydcimin.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">* Basic Wireframe<br/> </p><p>A unique advantage of indies having their own website is that it gives devs more options to sell their games than ever before. Simply and elegantly from their own website, indies will be able to sell their games without needing to redirect to a 3rd party. The decision whether to sell through Home of Indies, Steam, or Itch.io is up to each and every individual developer. We have no intentions of competing directly with the market leaders in gaming today. We’re here to help provide devs a front end resource so that indie developers do not need to always give out a third party link. Instead, they can work on building their own brand by directing potential customers to their own beautiful websites showcasing their games. This includes assistance in handling game key distribution, website control panels, and help with marketing on the back end of your website.<br/> </p><p>Using customizable tags and dynamic internal SEO, both the public and fellow devs will be able to find the indie games they are looking for. All the features for Home of Indies that we are going to provide will be simple and easy to implement. No matter your skill level, we will provide the resources you need for any game.<br/> </p><p>We are also going to provide something unique to the indie scene. This is the option for devs to use our “Housekeeping” feature. Differing from major crowdfunding sites, this ‘micro-funding’ is where you can ask fans, friends, and family to help fund your projects on a small scale. Once you have your website designed they way you want, drag and drop the housekeeping widget onto your page. Choose the amount you wish to raise up to an undetermined cap, enter some info, and you are ready! We don’t take any cuts and you will receive your funds as soon as the payment processor allows. Small amounts here and there can mean the difference between someone giving up on their game and completing the project. Also, unlike other crowdfunding options, your campaign is not solely targeting the public. Fellow indie devs from better economies, or who have been successful can support other devs through this method.<br/> </p><p>Home of Indies will also allow users to find indies that are hiring as part of our fully driven job board. Mark your project as looking for help informing people what positions you are looking for or if you prefer post on the job board itself.</p><p><br/>Other indie marketplaces are, even now, makingentry for developers more difficult by increasing fees and competition for start-ups. Indies, now more than ever, need options. You need a marketplace that has your best interests at heart and supports you every step of the way. Home of Indies will provide just that.

Although other listings elsewhere are nice, a quality website dedicated to your project can either attract or detract from your game and it often decides the first impressions of you as a developer.  If your website is updated you can then easily use that content wherever else you are marketing.

Introductionmarketing tools, website builder, mini-funding, marketplace, in-depth tutorials and more in one location... The indie game industry has major problems. The issues we see today have been brewing for years. Nowadays, developers often have to search high and low to hopefully find the resources they need. The indie devs of today spend countless hours looking for help and resources when they could be spending time working on their games. They often lack a “Home” to call their own and are forced to rely on themselves. We believe the indie community deserves better. Home Of Nerds was founded in 2016 by James Harris, Emily English, and a handful of others, who are passionate about gaming in general. James has been running various large projects of this caliber for many years, and also has 10 years experience in the web development/design field, along with our other mature graphic design and development team. We started by creating our own news platform from scratch - www.homeofnerds.com - which is aimed at the community and is not just another generic news site. Within our community, we have created a hub on our official Discord partner server with over 1600+ indie developers, who chat about all sorts of topics and get help daily with their projects. The reason behind starting the Home of Indies project is that we see first hand the lack of help, advice, and resources that are available to independent developers. We see talent go to waste on a daily basis - either through lack of funds or lack of direction. With the contributors’ help, we will provide a platform that will assist developers as never before. By working closely with sales experts and market leaders, we will provide an extensive step by step resource center which will consist of easy to follow guides on every aspect of indie development and marketing. By providing these resources, devs will no longer need to spend hours looking for help on difficult subjects. The most recent and up to date guides for every subject important to indies will be right at your fingertips and we aren’t stopping there. Home of Indies will enable developers to craft their own professional custom websites with very little effort, for free. This allows each developer to have a professional webpage that of studio quality and is individual to them. The customizable widgets will allow indies to add any features they feel will help their development in the industry. We don’t just give you a profile. We give you the tools to build your own professional studio. However, Home of Indies will be much more than just an indie gaming website builder. That is not our only focus. We are striving to provide everything indie developers need to be successful. We are helping developers succeed in all phases of creating a game; including the need for a simple yet feature packed website. * Basic Wireframe A unique advantage of indies having their own website is that it gives devs more options to sell their games than ever before. Simply and elegantly from their own website, indies will be able to sell their games without needing to redirect to a 3rd party. The decision whether to sell through Home of Indies, Steam, or Itch.io is up to each and every individual developer. We have no intentions of competing directly with the market leaders in gaming today. We’re here to help provide devs a front end resource so that indie developers do not need to always give out a third party link. Instead, they can work on building their own brand by directing potential customers to their own beautiful websites showcasing their games. This includes assistance in handling game key distribution, website control panels, and help with marketing on the back end of your website. Using customizable tags and dynamic internal SEO, both the public and fellow devs will be able to find the indie games they are looking for. All the features for Home of Indies that we are going to provide will be simple and easy to implement. No matter your skill level, we will provide the resources you need for any game. We are also going to provide something unique to the indie scene. This is the option for devs to use our “Housekeeping” feature. Differing from major crowdfunding sites, this ‘micro-funding’ is where you can ask fans, friends, and family to help fund your projects on a small scale. Once you have your website designed they way you want, drag and drop the housekeeping widget onto your page. Choose the amount you wish to raise up to an undetermined cap, enter some info, and you are ready! We don’t take any cuts and you will receive your funds as soon as the payment processor allows. Small amounts here and there can mean the difference between someone giving up on their game and completing the project. Also, unlike other crowdfunding options, your campaign is not solely targeting the public. Fellow indie devs from better economies, or who have been successful can support other devs through this method. Home of Indies will also allow users to find indies that are hiring as part of our fully driven job board. Mark your project as looking for help informing people what positions you are looking for or if you prefer post on the job board itself.Other indie marketplaces are, even now, makingentry for developers more difficult by increasing fees and competition for start-ups. Indies, now more than ever, need options. You need a marketplace that has your best interests at heart and supports you every step of the way. Home of Indies will provide just that. Personal support for every indie developer through our team of people who are just like you. How will the money be spent? Home of Indies is asking for £10000 to go towards maintaining and developing the platform and being able to support the various challenges that come with creating a platform of such diversity. Once we raise the money we will keep our dedicated community 100% informed on what we are accomplishing with your donations. Either through our weekly dev blog emails, or updates coming from our online sources, we will be completely transparent with the funds provided.    Indie developers will come to the website and will be greeted by various already running indie projects, as well as a resource center. They will be able to create an account with all of their main details as well as creating their own limitless website, via Bootstrap 4. Devs will be able to drag and drop widgets and create their website with ease.Whether they have no prior knowledge, or more advanced, they’ll be able to code directly on our servers and get help when they need it. Devs will be able to use their own domain with our service.   Once a website has been created, it'll appear on our homepage, and the developer can share it with the rest of the indie community and beyond. We use the latest technology, which will enable creation of a high-quality studio worthy website that will be interesting to potential new supporters of the project.  Once their site is up and running, developers will be able to take advantage of our widget selection. They can drag and drop a buy button, add PayPal accounts, and take sales straight through the website they have created with us.

<p>“Why is this campaign only $1,000? Don't you need more than that? ” :</p>
<p>• The answer is no I really don’t. I’m not trying to set out to make a record breaking crowdfunding campaign and although I want as many donations as possible, the numbers being worked out ensures the game gets in as many hands as possible and me making a very small profit.</p>
<p>“So what am I getting out of supporting this? ”: </p>
<p>•You get limited edition pressings of the game, limited edition cards and at certain tiers having a hand in the creation process of other editions of the game.</p>

<p>So with this campaign I want to make a modular game that includes user input and other forms of media as well : Smartphone Apps, console games and PC.

<p>First steps of the naval game project were made by Bombat game team in 2010. The project was conceived as an alternative to PC games for our own children. We recalled very interesting, simple mechanics of the seafaring miniatures genre. Our basic mechanics trace their roots back to military headquarters games of naval officers. The greatest historical naval battles were modeled in these games and they brought up several generations of naval officers. During our work in libraries we found rules of the naval learning game published in 1848!<br/></p>
<p><i>Naval Battle</i> proposed now for your attention allows modelling battles of the 2 opponents fleets (each of 4 different sailing ships) and thanking to this project we want to extend maximum number of players to 4 and publish English version of rules (currently we have it in the electronic form only). We selected Indiegogo platform, because it allows making project for Ukraine citizens, so this is the only good chance to start expanding our brand around the world. We successfully published our first game of our naval series in Ukraine in 2012. A lot of ideas on project development arose during our communications with our customers. With your help we can present the project in the USA, Europe and other regions!</p>

<h3>About me and current game</h3>
<p>I am very addicted yahtzee player and played it a lot. As there is no good enough online platform for that game I tried to start my own and give something worth to yahtzee fans. 4 years ago I started it and invested around $3000 in development.

<p><b>Current problems:</b></p>
<p></p>
<ul>

<li>Financial issues (paying everything myself: hosting, fixing issues)</li>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Goals</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Make it #1 yahtzee game online (it is currently close to that)</li>
<li>Playable on all the important devices (tablets, phones...)</li>
<li>Make it profitable with cash games and tournaments and memberships</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need to Succeed</h3> <p>$70.000 is needed for complete successful version on a long run. Money invested goes for development ($53.000) and promoting the game ($17.000). Dedicated hosting and management will be done and invested by myself.</p>
<p><b>What if I don't get 100% of funds?</b></p>
<p>In that scenario all the money will be invested in improving the current game depending on amount got. Phases of development are very clear so money will not be wasted but will try to get the most out of it!</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<div>Yahtzee lovers and yahtzee players will get supporters badges depending on amounts sent described in perks.</div>
<div>
<b>Premium membership</b> includes advanced personal profile options and will include entrance to all the scheduled real money tournaments in mentioned period.</div>
<div>
<b>Note:</b> If project is not 100% funded then low amount backers will be included as official supporters on a dedicated page in place of official supporters.</div>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks, Challenges &amp; Predictions</h3> <p> There should be no risks at all. Current game already works fine for 4 years and the only risk is that it will be not so popular as expected. So it can only go better than it is now.</p>
<p>Game currently has 8250 registered players but more than 70% of people play unregistered because of no real motivation to register. Not any kind of promotion is done because of lack of time and finances.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Implementing leagues, tournaments, multiplayer mode, player achievements and other things will higher percentage of registered players</li>
<li>Facebook version and mobile devices versions will bring it to wider audience</li>
<li>Implementing cash games and tournaments will make game profitable</li>
</ul>
<div>My predictions are that when it is completely done and planned amount invested in marketing it should have over 75.000 active players. When finances are in case to achieve positive balance it is only needed around 5.000 active members (and only 1% of it to be paying members is enough)</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Why I believe in success</h3> <p>I work 6 years as a freelance internet marketer and have pretty good success in that field. Helped a lot of small and medium businesses achieve their goals and now it is time to focus on my own projects.</p>
<p>Without any promotion I managed to make one pretty popular yahtzee platform so with putting it on a professional level and investing smart in internet marketing it must become #1 yahtzee game online.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><p></p><p></p><h3>Game Development Phases</h3><p><b>Phase 1 - Single Player Plus</b></p><ul>

</div></div>","Yahtzee itself is a simple game popular around the world. The specific thing about this yahtzee game is that it is more complex than usual one people got used to play.


About me and current game
I am very addicted yahtzee player and played it a lot. As there is no good enough online platform for that game I tried to start my own and give something worth to yahtzee fans. 4 years ago I started it and invested around $3000 in development. As I am not a programmer myself I invested my own money and paid programmers to make it for me.



Current version of the game you can find here: Online Yahtzee 
Current stats (without any promotions):


2000 daily visits
8200 registered users (most of people play unregistered)
Over 450 official games per day (over 1000 total)
2500 facebook fans







Current problems:


A bit messy code
Some security issues (people can hack high scores)
Game in flash and should be changed to html 5
Financial issues (paying everything myself: hosting, fixing issues)

But still it works pretty good and has a lot of players!
Goals


Make it #1 yahtzee game online (it is currently close to that)
Playable on all the important devices (tablets, phones...)
Make it profitable with cash games and tournaments and memberships
   What I Need to Succeed $70.000 is needed for complete successful version on a long run. Money invested goes for development ($53.000) and promoting the game ($17.000). Dedicated hosting and management will be done and invested by myself.
What if I don't get 100% of funds?
In that scenario all the money will be invested in improving the current game depending on amount got. Phases of development are very clear so money will not be wasted but will try to get the most out of it!

What You Get
Yahtzee lovers and yahtzee players will get supporters badges depending on amounts sent described in perks.

Premium membership includes advanced personal profile options and will include entrance to all the scheduled real money tournaments in mentioned period.

Note: If project is not 100% funded then low amount backers will be included as official supporters on a dedicated page in place of official supporters.

    Risks, Challenges & Predictions  There should be no risks at all. Current game already works fine for 4 years and the only risk is that it will be not so popular as expected. So it can only go better than it is now.
Game currently has 8250 registered players but more than 70% of people play unregistered because of no real motivation to register. Not any kind of promotion is done because of lack of time and finances.


Implementing leagues, tournaments, multiplayer mode, player achievements and other things will higher percentage of registered players
Facebook version and mobile devices versions will bring it to wider audience
Implementing cash games and tournaments will make game profitable

My predictions are that when it is completely done and planned amount invested in marketing it should have over 75.000 active players. When finances are in case to achieve positive balance it is only needed around 5.000 active members (and only 1% of it to be paying members is enough)
    Why I believe in success I work 6 years as a freelance internet marketer and have pretty good success in that field. Helped a lot of small and medium businesses achieve their goals and now it is time to focus on my own projects.
Without any promotion I managed to make one pretty popular yahtzee platform so with putting it on a professional level and investing smart in internet marketing it must become #1 yahtzee game online.

design and delivers the most immersive gaming, recreational and entertainment
experience in the market, helping everyone enjoy and enhance their media
consumption experience.</p>
<p>While gaming was the initial
application for product development, we discovered something else during the
prototype and testing phases.  Just as the Lifestyle Media Pods were ideal
for gaming, it was also an optimal experience for watching a movie. It was a
truly stunning and immersive experience.</p>
<p>When other companies focus on
products to wear for example gloves, vest, glasses/goggles, and headsets. We
focus on all of that in one unit. No need to wear silly uncomfortable products
that you’re not able to wear for long periods of time. No need to change a
room, remodel a basement or garage all that does is brings a houses value down
because it may not provide value to that next owner. No need to worry about
that here. We got the all in one package that will blow your entertainment
enjoyment away.</p><p><br/></p>
<p></p><h3>About the Founder</h3><div>Matt Winchester is the Founder. He’s also the inventor behind Boxd’s pioneering Lifestyle Media Pod (LMP) product. </div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1332048/files/20150327141934-my_character.png?1427491174"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div><div></div>
<p></p>
<p>His gaming world came into perspective when he was 8 years
old and his mother the gamer she is, introduced games into his life. She would
play Super Mario and Duck Hunt on Nintendo’s new gaming console. Matt’s
fascination and passion for games began to grow and started to become an
important part of his life. </p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">For the next 25 years, he realized that video games
aren’t always ideal to be played in the living room. In his opinion, there are various
levels of distractions not to mention, high foot-traffic areas. When gaming and movie enthusiasts take over a public space (e.g. living
room or basement) they are sometimes criticized for having loud speakers or causing
distractions and offending others. In spite of having widescreen TV’s it is
still very easy for gamers to get distracted and be able to enjoy a game to
it’s full potential.  </span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Out of this
frustration, Matt’s idea to create a solution came into play.  He realized that the only solution to the
problem was simple; he needed to create something that would allow more privacy
and fewer distractions to gaming lovers like him.  That’s how he came up with the, Lifestyle
Media Pod.</span></p>

The future and the new
way to play your video games and watch your favorite movies!Lets take a few moments to analyze the value.----------Immerse Yourself.------------------Enhanced Experience------------Inside is where it happens.-------------------Get in to it---------------
Now thats value.

About Box'd Entertainment Inc.
We manufacture recreational and
gaming products designed to create immersive media environments and provide our
customers unique and heightened experiences. 
We are energized by a ""can
do"" attitude. Our Credo is that one can identify and solve a problem. That
it has a vision and energy to transform an idea into a viable product. We
question the status quo and deliver an answer that may be a bit radical. It is
the embodiment of the American pioneering spirit.
We have a vision to be a major factor
in shaping the future of gaming and entertainment, enabling players to
experience the utmost level of immersion and engagement, thereby improving
performance and enjoyment.
We have a mission to be the product
of choice for the world's gamers and media consumers. Box'd Entertainment
design and delivers the most immersive gaming, recreational and entertainment
experience in the market, helping everyone enjoy and enhance their media
consumption experience.
While gaming was the initial
application for product development, we discovered something else during the
prototype and testing phases.  Just as the Lifestyle Media Pods were ideal
for gaming, it was also an optimal experience for watching a movie. It was a
truly stunning and immersive experience.
When other companies focus on
products to wear for example gloves, vest, glasses/goggles, and headsets. We
focus on all of that in one unit. No need to wear silly uncomfortable products
that you’re not able to wear for long periods of time. No need to change a
room, remodel a basement or garage all that does is brings a houses value down
because it may not provide value to that next owner. No need to worry about
that here. We got the all in one package that will blow your entertainment
enjoyment away.
About the FounderMatt Winchester is the Founder. He’s also the inventor behind Boxd’s pioneering Lifestyle Media Pod (LMP) product. 




His gaming world came into perspective when he was 8 years
old and his mother the gamer she is, introduced games into his life. She would
play Super Mario and Duck Hunt on Nintendo’s new gaming console. Matt’s
fascination and passion for games began to grow and started to become an
important part of his life. For the next 25 years, he realized that video games
aren’t always ideal to be played in the living room. In his opinion, there are various
levels of distractions not to mention, high foot-traffic areas. When gaming and movie enthusiasts take over a public space (e.g. living
room or basement) they are sometimes criticized for having loud speakers or causing
distractions and offending others. In spite of having widescreen TV’s it is
still very easy for gamers to get distracted and be able to enjoy a game to
it’s full potential.  Out of this
frustration, Matt’s idea to create a solution came into play.  He realized that the only solution to the
problem was simple; he needed to create something that would allow more privacy
and fewer distractions to gaming lovers like him.  That’s how he came up with the, Lifestyle
Media Pod.

The Key
Marketing
Box'd Entertainment Inc. knows marketing is crucial for a business to
survive. Having a new or niche product out on the market customers tend to have
difficulties understanding the value behind it. This makes it harder for
businesses to market their products and to use basic marketing tools. With the
right kind of marketing, we can better educate our customers. This is where we
need your help. 



During this campaign we will be offering
free shipments on all units within the 48 states (Contiguous United
States). That’s a saving of up to $2,000 based on the size, weight, crating of units and location. We have partnered with
a local carrier who is willing to help and support with shipments for Box’d Entertainment
Inc. In addition, we have aligned
different perks depending on the amount of your contribution. This is as a
token of appreciation for your support. 

Here is a break down of where the funding will
go.



(Note: This does not include free shipping perks.) 
If your passion is gaming or watching
movies, this product is a truly exceptional product you must have.  The ability to immerse your self inside this
media pod is like no other.  Don’t take
our word for it.

<div style="""">
<p>Lodran, once a peaceful world, guarded by the power  of very ancient and mystical crystals and resulted in creation of three peaceful and harmonious realms of Sartou, Multa, and YarKahhn existing in balance.</p>
<p>And then It came..</p>
<p>Nobody knows the origin of It but it brought armies after armies of pure evil from the void opened. It destroyed the great magical city of Sartou, turning it into a haunted, ruined wasteland. In such desperate times, all people of Lodran formed The Committee and handed over all the powers of crystal through it to the Grand Commandant, Darrion, of the armies of Multa for the defence of Lodran and its three realms.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1273444/files/20150306070957-city.gif?1425654597"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Battle after battle, victory after victory, the committee pushed the invaders back in the void in an effort to throw them back in the void and close it off with the powers of crystals. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">On the verge of defeat and unable to break the siege It released the most unimaginable horror, a terrifying weapon which people came to call ""the sickness"".</span></p>
<p>Now 50 years later war is still going on but people of Loran weakened by the sickness are losing hope and the bridgehead around the void is growing again.</p>
<p><b>The Sickness</b></p>
<p>While invaders stood in the fortress they had built around the void, the plague they released quickly spread in the lands of Loran. A frightening infliction, slowly turning everything it effects into half living and half dead, an intense pain leading to a madness.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Committee</b><br/></p>
<p>when Sartou got destroyed with its armies decimated, people formed the Committee and handed all the powers to its leader Darion to defeat the invaders, he did not get the approval of the power ruling house of YarKhaan. To counter this he started a civil war and rampaged through YarKhaan destroying any resistance he met. The Committee rules by decree and ruthlessly quells any opposition to its supreme authority. Any one who questions its authority has no other option but to run and seek protection in the vast desolate places of the old kingdom of YarKhaan.</p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>

<div>Burshi is inspired by the tradition of great JRPGs for strategic combat and character progression, and we mixed it with successful western RPG model of open world and freedom to explore this world with a non-linear story.</div>
<div><b>Combat</b></div>
<div>Combat will offer a mixture of turn based with real time battles. Also weather or day/night cycle will buff up or down your weapon or spell depending upon your weapon/spell choices.</div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1286093/files/20150311051051-attack1.gif?1426075851"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div>
<div><b>Advanced Leveling System</b></div>
<div>In Burshi, character can earn experience and level up their stats by it.</div>
<div>In addition to this classic system, weapon and skill categories will also earn experience the more you use a specific type of weapon or skill. For example a two handed weapons will earn experience if you use them more or a single handed weapons in case you use them more. The same goes for skills, using two weapons in both hands will level up 'two hands' skill more than 'one handed' skill. Your use of swords more will result in levelling up sword skills rather than archery. In short, you can not only finely control how you level up your character but build completely different characters by levelling them up differently. While levelling up you will gain 'Perks' which you can use to strategically upgrade your weapons and skills. Each choice you make, using a certain type of weapon, or a spell, or using perks to upgrade will strategically effect your game play.</div>

<br/>
</div>
<div><b>Non-Linear Story</b></div>
<div>Burshi will offer a rich branching story driven by choices you will make.</div>
<div>Be warned, this will mean that you will not be able to play through all of the story in a single play through, as game is built so that your choices are not just cosmetic but does effect the overall story. On the other hand, this story than will offer you significant re-play value as well.</div>

Release date: 2016
Early Concept Demo developed by a team of 5 people available for download












Lodran

Lodran, once a peaceful world, guarded by the power  of very ancient and mystical crystals and resulted in creation of three peaceful and harmonious realms of Sartou, Multa, and YarKahhn existing in balance.
And then It came..
Nobody knows the origin of It but it brought armies after armies of pure evil from the void opened. It destroyed the great magical city of Sartou, turning it into a haunted, ruined wasteland. In such desperate times, all people of Lodran formed The Committee and handed over all the powers of crystal through it to the Grand Commandant, Darrion, of the armies of Multa for the defence of Lodran and its three realms.



Battle after battle, victory after victory, the committee pushed the invaders back in the void in an effort to throw them back in the void and close it off with the powers of crystals. On the verge of defeat and unable to break the siege It released the most unimaginable horror, a terrifying weapon which people came to call ""the sickness"".
Now 50 years later war is still going on but people of Loran weakened by the sickness are losing hope and the bridgehead around the void is growing again.
The Sickness
While invaders stood in the fortress they had built around the void, the plague they released quickly spread in the lands of Loran. A frightening infliction, slowly turning everything it effects into half living and half dead, an intense pain leading to a madness.


The Committee
when Sartou got destroyed with its armies decimated, people formed the Committee and handed all the powers to its leader Darion to defeat the invaders, he did not get the approval of the power ruling house of YarKhaan. To counter this he started a civil war and rampaged through YarKhaan destroying any resistance he met. The Committee rules by decree and ruthlessly quells any opposition to its supreme authority. Any one who questions its authority has no other option but to run and seek protection in the vast desolate places of the old kingdom of YarKhaan.   


Burshi is inspired by the tradition of great JRPGs for strategic combat and character progression, and we mixed it with successful western RPG model of open world and freedom to explore this world with a non-linear story.
Combat
Combat will offer a mixture of turn based with real time battles. Also weather or day/night cycle will buff up or down your weapon or spell depending upon your weapon/spell choices.




Advanced Leveling System
In Burshi, character can earn experience and level up their stats by it.
In addition to this classic system, weapon and skill categories will also earn experience the more you use a specific type of weapon or skill. For example a two handed weapons will earn experience if you use them more or a single handed weapons in case you use them more. The same goes for skills, using two weapons in both hands will level up 'two hands' skill more than 'one handed' skill. Your use of swords more will result in levelling up sword skills rather than archery. In short, you can not only finely control how you level up your character but build completely different characters by levelling them up differently. While levelling up you will gain 'Perks' which you can use to strategically upgrade your weapons and skills. Each choice you make, using a certain type of weapon, or a spell, or using perks to upgrade will strategically effect your game play.




Non-Linear Story
Burshi will offer a rich branching story driven by choices you will make.
Be warned, this will mean that you will not be able to play through all of the story in a single play through, as game is built so that your choices are not just cosmetic but does effect the overall story. On the other hand, this story than will offer you significant re-play value as well.




Your behaviour and choices will change the lands of Loran and your future possibilities according to who you talk to, who you decide to help or battle, quests you complete, the allies or enemies you make etc... 
    Why Crowdfund We have been funding game development with our own funds. With Indiegogo, we hope to be able to boost development of our game further and offer gamers more and better content.
With extra funds we plan to add more members to our team for both artistic and development side. This will also offer us a great deal to preserve our creative freedom and independence. We intend to use portion of the funds to also fund great game sound design as well as more game sound tracks.
We have been working for months to make a good game, with your help we can make a great game!

Your friend never showed up and introduced you to anyone. What a liar, huh? In fact, some weird girl in a “Game Over” hoodie was your last memory.</p>
<p>I know you’ve got plenty of questions, so let me break it down for you. Briefly, you are dead. Yeah, people are somewhat frail. But you died before expected, you know, tiredness, a bunch of work, old age, heh.</p>
<p>So make your sweet butt comfortable in this old cinema. Yeah, it’s a little lame and dull in here, but what did you expect? It’s a purgatory, and there’s no janitor to purge the filth in this place. And, in fact, the place itself had a pretty bad reputation. By the way, there’s a mop in the corner.</p>
<p>Oh, cheer up, you have fantastic roommates!<br/>That redheaded kid in an old outfit by the bar is Bellboy. Yeah, she’s a girl, easy-going one, but she can drink as much beer as a bunch of Irish workers after a hard working day, so don’t even think about drinking her down for a bet. That tall lady is Sister June. She’ll probably take you to the School for Noble Maidens, so be careful with her.</p>
<p>That eternally sleeping and grumpy creature is Keyla. She is not going to rush to support you, so don’t even ask her.<br/>The girl looking passionately at you is Ruby. She seems to like you, so let’s see how fast she’ll bring you under control.</p>
<p>My name is Fasaria, I’m the reaper, and it’s my fault that you’re here, or maybe it’s your own fault. Look at how you live, slouch and stuff yourself with junk food.</p> <img alt=""Info"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://finchbird.ru/ff/overview.gif"" src=""""/><p>So, here’s a little deal for you.

IMPORTANT!We plan to release the game even if we are unable to reach the Funding Goal!(We use Flexible Goal)But of course, this may affect the release date. Details in FAQ

Hey, Newbie!Yesterday, you enjoyed your quarter-pound burger sipping cool Coke. Your friend never showed up and introduced you to anyone. What a liar, huh? In fact, some weird girl in a “Game Over” hoodie was your last memory.
I know you’ve got plenty of questions, so let me break it down for you. Briefly, you are dead. Yeah, people are somewhat frail. But you died before expected, you know, tiredness, a bunch of work, old age, heh.
So make your sweet butt comfortable in this old cinema. Yeah, it’s a little lame and dull in here, but what did you expect? It’s a purgatory, and there’s no janitor to purge the filth in this place. And, in fact, the place itself had a pretty bad reputation. By the way, there’s a mop in the corner.
Oh, cheer up, you have fantastic roommates!That redheaded kid in an old outfit by the bar is Bellboy. Yeah, she’s a girl, easy-going one, but she can drink as much beer as a bunch of Irish workers after a hard working day, so don’t even think about drinking her down for a bet. That tall lady is Sister June. She’ll probably take you to the School for Noble Maidens, so be careful with her.
That eternally sleeping and grumpy creature is Keyla. She is not going to rush to support you, so don’t even ask her.The girl looking passionately at you is Ruby. She seems to like you, so let’s see how fast she’ll bring you under control.
My name is Fasaria, I’m the reaper, and it’s my fault that you’re here, or maybe it’s your own fault. Look at how you live, slouch and stuff yourself with junk food. So, here’s a little deal for you. There’s no way you can just get out of here on your own, and I don’t want anyone from above to know about it. You and I are essentially in the same boat.Let’s help each other, deal? Help me fix the screw-up, and we will try to return you back into your body like nothing has ever happened.
Besides, the ladies have several personal requests. Do it, and they’ll take good care of you, trust me. You are the only one of us who can walk through all the circles of hell without any consequences. 
Freaked Fleapit is a game that combines two or more genres - Visual Novel and Rhythm Dungeon Crawler.

<h3>Who we are at Robot City Games</h3> <p>We first opened Robot City games in 2008 in a small storefront in Binghamton, New York. It's truly a successful small, family business and for years we've put everything we've made into constant improvements and upgrades. </p>
<p>At first we carried a mix of video games and card games and slowly we started replacing the gaming tables with arcade games to focus on our passion and expertise. </p>
<p>While expanding our store and arcade at the same time we ran out of room and an opportunity presented it's self when the business next door closed. We quickly rented the adjoining space, had a doorway installed between the storefronts and slowly started filling the additional 1200 square foot space with arcade games, adding lighting and an atmosphere that was lost in modern arcades. We started an eclectic mix of games from all time periods, no matter what the highlight of your arcade experience was as a child, when you turned a corner you were there.</p>
<ul> </ul> <p>We do not want to be another retail chain store with the same old stuff. While we do sell modern games, we look at our store as more in the style of a curated book store, high quality and organized to cover the entire range of video game history. We look at our arcade in the same way. </p>
<p> We saved every dime we could with a bigger goal in mind and in early 2015 we found the right place. A 7000 square foot building was for sale just a block away and perfect for what we wanted to do based on the feedback we've gotten from our customers over the last 7 years. We put a down payment down and started work on our building. </p>

<p></p><h1></h1><p></p><h1>Good News!!</h1><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our game, Transcend has been GREENLIT!!! That means that the world's largest digital distributor of video games has agreed to carry our game in their store!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460584943/greenlight_akxvy4.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">But now that means that the heat is on! We are very grateful to the many people who visited our page and voted to have our game Greenlit and we don't want to disappoint them. We want this game to be as awesome as we envisioned it. But we're going to need some help to get it done...</p><div><br/></div><h1>About the Game</h1><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Transcend is a very unique game with some very unique gameplay mechanics. It is the story of an average guy who is given the power to bring himself back from the dead and travel back in time. The story unfolds as the player guides the character through mind bending puzzles that utilize intuitive game mechanics that capitalize of the player's special powers. </p><p><br/></p><h1>Mechanics </h1><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Resurrection: </b>By using an ancient artifact, the bones of an ancient wizard, the player has the ability to bring him/herself back from the dead. This is not merely a way to avoid death so as to make the player invincible to his/her enemies. Far from it. Each puzzle in the game depends on the player's ability to die and come back from the dead. In each level the player will notice that some walls and platforms are transparent/ghostly. While the player is alive, he/she will be able to pass directly through these objects. But when the player dies, he/she collides with these ghostly objects while passing through the solid ones. Instead of being a punishment for failure, in this game, death becomes a means to an end.

<b><div><b><br/></b></div>Time Travel:</b>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
The player will also have the ability to travel back in time. Imagine if Marty McFly knew that, in the future, he would travel back in time and visit his past self. By knowing this ahead of time he would have been able to cooperate with his past self to accomplish what would otherwise be impossible. In Transcend, you will do just that. In levels that feature the time travel mechanic, the player will be called upon to complete the level once while anticipating what his/her future self will do, then again while cooperating with his/her past self. This mechanic is accomplished by recording the game pad inputs from the player and playing them back on a clone of the player. Such an approach allows for advanced game play by slightly altering the level as the player returns to it a second time. For example, imagine holding down the left button to run left and hitting a wall, but instead of releasing the button you continue to hold it down. With the wall in the way, the player will not move. But what if you were to later come back to that level but this time remove the wall. You will see your previous self running to the left, but with the wall out of the way, he will continue to run. We have packed several puzzles into Transcend that will require the player to think carefully as they use this unique and intuitive mechanic.</p> <div>

Both angels and demons are only interested in the player while he/she is a ghost. Both characters move along their own predetermined path (usually just pacing back and forth) until the player becomes a ghost and comes within their field of vision. When this happens the angel will fly toward (or chase) the player. When the angel comes in contact with the player the player will be resurrected by the angel. After this the angel will resume his original path but will do so from this new location. This means that the player has the ability to move the angel around in order to cause the angel to collide with the demon. When this happens, the demon is killed by the angel. This is important because when the demon comes in contact with the player while the player is a ghost, the demon will kill the player’s soul, thus bringing the level to an end. </span><br/></p>

A worm hole is a passage way through space-time. By entering a worm hole, you immediately come out the other side. That other side may be in the same level, or in another level. It may even be at another point in time! (see the time-travel section). The worm holes will be color coded so if you see two blue wormholes, it’s a pretty safe bet that entering one will cause you to come out of the other.</span><br/></p>

<h1><br/></h1>
<h1>The Story </h1>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Much thought and brainstorming has gone into the storyline. The game will have an elaborate storyline that includes the main character obtaining necromantic abilities from the residual magical properties from the remains of an ancient wizard's body. We'll tell the story of how this wizard came to be, how he died and how the main character found his remains. Fleshing out this story in the game will give the game a much richer feel and make it more of an adventure game rather than a puzzle platformer.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<h1>Meet the Lead Designer</h1>
<img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://myweb.ttu.edu/bricolon/b.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin:00px 00px 00px 10px;""/><p style=""text-align: justify;""><a href=""https://twitter.com/BrianDColon"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Brian </a>learned the basics of game design while studying Game and Simulation Programming at DeVry University. It was there he was introduced to GameMaker: Studio. Over the years he has become an expert in this engine and is now developing Transcend with it. Prior to the beginning of this project, Brian has created several projects for the Android OS. Titles include a retro-style endless runner called <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TentMakerGames.RunBotRun"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Run Bot Run</a>, a hack and slash platformer called <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TentMakerGames.Novitas"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Novitas</a>, and a touch screen running game called <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TentMakerGames.Twiddle_Race"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twiddle Race</a>. One title that he is particularly proud of that had to go on hold while he works on Transcend is an ariel combat game with the working title <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jZSg5BkE4k"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dog Fight</a>.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1>What will we do with the money?</h1>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This question has a very simple answer: 100% of the funds received will go to the art studio that will be redoing the art for the game.

Good News!!Our game, Transcend has been GREENLIT!!! That means that the world's largest digital distributor of video games has agreed to carry our game in their store!But now that means that the heat is on! We are very grateful to the many people who visited our page and voted to have our game Greenlit and we don't want to disappoint them. We want this game to be as awesome as we envisioned it. But we're going to need some help to get it done...About the GameTranscend is a very unique game with some very unique gameplay mechanics. It is the story of an average guy who is given the power to bring himself back from the dead and travel back in time. The story unfolds as the player guides the character through mind bending puzzles that utilize intuitive game mechanics that capitalize of the player's special powers. Mechanics Resurrection: By using an ancient artifact, the bones of an ancient wizard, the player has the ability to bring him/herself back from the dead. This is not merely a way to avoid death so as to make the player invincible to his/her enemies. Far from it. Each puzzle in the game depends on the player's ability to die and come back from the dead. In each level the player will notice that some walls and platforms are transparent/ghostly. While the player is alive, he/she will be able to pass directly through these objects. But when the player dies, he/she collides with these ghostly objects while passing through the solid ones. Instead of being a punishment for failure, in this game, death becomes a means to an end. 





This image does not reflect how the graphics will look in the final product. Please keep in mind that the graphics will be improved dramatically if this campaign is successful. This image is meant to demonstrate the game mechanics only.


Time Travel:

The player will also have the ability to travel back in time. Imagine if Marty McFly knew that, in the future, he would travel back in time and visit his past self. By knowing this ahead of time he would have been able to cooperate with his past self to accomplish what would otherwise be impossible. In Transcend, you will do just that. In levels that feature the time travel mechanic, the player will be called upon to complete the level once while anticipating what his/her future self will do, then again while cooperating with his/her past self. This mechanic is accomplished by recording the game pad inputs from the player and playing them back on a clone of the player. Such an approach allows for advanced game play by slightly altering the level as the player returns to it a second time. For example, imagine holding down the left button to run left and hitting a wall, but instead of releasing the button you continue to hold it down. With the wall in the way, the player will not move. But what if you were to later come back to that level but this time remove the wall. You will see your previous self running to the left, but with the wall out of the way, he will continue to run. We have packed several puzzles into Transcend that will require the player to think carefully as they use this unique and intuitive mechanic. 





This image does not reflect how the graphics will look in the final product. Please keep in mind that the graphics will be improved dramatically if this campaign is successful. This image is meant to demonstrate the game mechanics only.



Angels and Demons: Since the player will be carefully walking the fence between life and death, eventually he/she will come in contact with beings from the other side. Both angels and demons are only interested in the player while he/she is a ghost. Both characters move along their own predetermined path (usually just pacing back and forth) until the player becomes a ghost and comes within their field of vision. When this happens the angel will fly toward (or chase) the player. When the angel comes in contact with the player the player will be resurrected by the angel. After this the angel will resume his original path but will do so from this new location. This means that the player has the ability to move the angel around in order to cause the angel to collide with the demon. When this happens, the demon is killed by the angel. This is important because when the demon comes in contact with the player while the player is a ghost, the demon will kill the player’s soul, thus bringing the level to an end. 




This image does not reflect how the graphics will look in the final product. Please keep in mind that the graphics will be improved dramatically if this campaign is successful. This image is meant to demonstrate the game mechanics only.



Wormholes: One way to escape the demon or the angel is to jump into wormholes that may be scattered around the level. A worm hole is a passage way through space-time. By entering a worm hole, you immediately come out the other side. That other side may be in the same level, or in another level. It may even be at another point in time! (see the time-travel section). The worm holes will be color coded so if you see two blue wormholes, it’s a pretty safe bet that entering one will cause you to come out of the other.

The Story 
Much thought and brainstorming has gone into the storyline. The game will have an elaborate storyline that includes the main character obtaining necromantic abilities from the residual magical properties from the remains of an ancient wizard's body. We'll tell the story of how this wizard came to be, how he died and how the main character found his remains. Fleshing out this story in the game will give the game a much richer feel and make it more of an adventure game rather than a puzzle platformer.


Meet the Lead Designer
Brian learned the basics of game design while studying Game and Simulation Programming at DeVry University. It was there he was introduced to GameMaker: Studio. Over the years he has become an expert in this engine and is now developing Transcend with it. Prior to the beginning of this project, Brian has created several projects for the Android OS. Titles include a retro-style endless runner called Run Bot Run, a hack and slash platformer called Novitas, and a touch screen running game called Twiddle Race. One title that he is particularly proud of that had to go on hold while he works on Transcend is an ariel combat game with the working title Dog Fight.  

What will we do with the money?
This question has a very simple answer: 100% of the funds received will go to the art studio that will be redoing the art for the game. Even if we do not reach our goal, everything we do receive will go to them. The programming and level design are almost finished and do not require any additional funds to complete.



On our Steam Greenlight page we've received mostly positive comments. The few negative comments we've received were all enjoining us to improve the art. With your help we can make that happen.


Risks and Challenges 
Since you will be contributing your hard earned money to this project we want to make sure that you are always in the know about what is happening in the development process. At no time do we want any of our backers wondering what we are doing with their money. We also consider our backers to be part of our team and we want you to feel as such.


To that end, we take the Transparency Pledge:
We pledge to be open and honest regarding all matters, good and bad, with frequent updates to all backers of this project. We will host a development blog that will update at least twice a week (Mondays and Wednesdays). This blog will contain all details about every aspect of the development process. Every milestone and every setback. We also invite you to follow us both on Twitter for daily updates (@CNazario_design and @BrianDColon). When something happens, you will know about it.
Even though we have developed and published smaller games in the past, this is our first major release. With that comes all the challenges that come with doing something for the first time. We are however confident that we can get this done. And like we said in our pledge, we will keep you updated every step of the way.",8.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>The story</h3>
<p>""Embers of the Gods"" is a story about a cyclic period in time when the gods are ""renewed"" or ""replaced"".  The god of nature going rogue brings about this time of change and manifests itself as anomalies in nature. Cold climate regions suddenly spawn pockets of tropical oasis, desert regions experience blankets of snow and ice. Throughout this period of change, the nature god sends hordes of his minions to destroy the world. The fate of the world, and ultimately the gods, relies on the actions of a commoner and a small group of adventurers.</p>
<p>In our game, players develop their party though exploration, combat, questing, and leveling up. The game world is rich with lore and immersive environments where countless treasures lie undiscovered. Deep lore and compelling story lines motivate the player to realize their true destiny which is ultimately to become gods.</p>
<h3><strong>What we are doing</strong></h3>
<p>This campaign is to raise funds for the development of a role playing video game that is influenced by old school RPG's like Might and Magic 6 and Wizardry 8. Our team here at Fortune Game Studio are inspired to bring you a gaming experience that will entertain you for years to come. Our goals are to achieve our game development dreams and leave a lasting impression on the world with this game.</p>
<p>This first fund raising campaign is to gain enough funds to develop our prototype demo into a more professional and polished work. Our next round of fund raising will occur after we have completed the work on our prototype demo, and it will encompass the entire development cycle of the full game. However, your contributions to this campaign and accompanying perk rewards will apply to the full game.</p>
<p>* Please note that accompanying demos, screenshots and videos all represent a work in progress and not the final product. The playable demo has many placeholder assets/artwork and may contain bugs and/or incomplete features as it is still in pre-alpha state. Most of the screen shots that are showcased were taken in 1080p, and they appear blurry in the thumbnails due to the size difference. Thank you for your patience and understanding.</p>
<h3>Who we are</h3>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are asking for a modest level of funding for developing a large scale RPG:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our funding needs are very concise. We will develop ""Embers of the Gods"" on a two year cycle with all of our team members working at indie rates. Every position on the team is essential and the budgeting for development is as lean as we can make it while still being able to support ourselves.</li>
<li>If we do not achieve our specific funding goals during this campaign, the funds that we do raise will pay our team to improve our prototype demo. We will continue to develop our core game code and improve our presentation to ensure that eventually we do achieve our financial goals.</li>
<li>Some of our perks are designed to get you involved with the development process of ""Embers of the Gods"". The alpha and beta tester perks let you get an insider's point of view, get you involved in identifying bugs, give you early access to the game, and keep you up to date with our progress.</li>
<li>A couple of our perks reward you with an in-game item and/or a bonus level. The item will be of artifact quality, which is the highest quality in the game, and the bonus level was our original demo level that ended up being too far out of scope for the vertical slice. There are many areas outside and inside to explore and several quests to complete, involving a village community alongside a majestic glacial lake. Parts of this region can be seen in our trailers and screen shots, but I don't want to reveal too much. This content is exclusive to our Franklin level contributors.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Every dollar that is contributed to our cause will have a great impact on our ability to develop this game. We have been able to develop our prototype demo on a very small budget with only a few of us working part time. Your gifts will help us make our dreams come true and allow us to provide some really great entertainment for many people.</p>
<ul><li>""Embers of the Gods"" is Rick's personal vision quest to bring back some of the magic of old school RPG's that has been missing from the world for so long. ""I believe that I can deliver a level of entertainment that will go down in history as one of the all time greats"".</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are minor risks and challenges that we will face, but our team is ready to overcome any obstacles that we encounter. Some of the challenges that we face are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Team dissolution<ul><li>The team is all pro, but it could dissolve at some point for any given reason.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Going over budget<ul><li>It is possible that we may have some oversights that we have not accounted for, but with our careful planning and a deep understanding of the development process, we can achieve our goals within the established boundaries.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Technology dependence<ul><li>Our development platform, the Unity 3d game engine, is reliable and proven in games like Wasteland 2, Deus Ex: The Fall, and Assassins Creed: Identity, but there still remains our dependency upon Unity developers to continue to provide a stable and bug free platform.</li></ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>What qualifies us to overcome these risks and challenges?</h3>
<ul>
<li>With years of Unity development experience between us, our team is competent and capable of overcoming any hurdles that may arise with our development platform. The team at Unity has a capable support network that we can reach out to and resolve issues.</li>
<li>If we do go over budget, it is not a game ender. We can always return to funding and continue our efforts through other means and investments.</li>
<li>Although our team consists of highly talented individuals that were hand picked for their positions, there are thousands of similarly talented developers that can continue where others have left off.</li>
<li>We have a collective level of accomplishment that assures our success and your satisfaction. The team was carefully assembled with all the right talents in all the right places to deliver a stellar product.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>

</ol></div>","The story
""Embers of the Gods"" is a story about a cyclic period in time when the gods are ""renewed"" or ""replaced"".  The god of nature going rogue brings about this time of change and manifests itself as anomalies in nature. Cold climate regions suddenly spawn pockets of tropical oasis, desert regions experience blankets of snow and ice. Throughout this period of change, the nature god sends hordes of his minions to destroy the world. The fate of the world, and ultimately the gods, relies on the actions of a commoner and a small group of adventurers.
In our game, players develop their party though exploration, combat, questing, and leveling up. The game world is rich with lore and immersive environments where countless treasures lie undiscovered. Deep lore and compelling story lines motivate the player to realize their true destiny which is ultimately to become gods.
What we are doing
This campaign is to raise funds for the development of a role playing video game that is influenced by old school RPG's like Might and Magic 6 and Wizardry 8. Our team here at Fortune Game Studio are inspired to bring you a gaming experience that will entertain you for years to come. Our goals are to achieve our game development dreams and leave a lasting impression on the world with this game.
This first fund raising campaign is to gain enough funds to develop our prototype demo into a more professional and polished work. Our next round of fund raising will occur after we have completed the work on our prototype demo, and it will encompass the entire development cycle of the full game. However, your contributions to this campaign and accompanying perk rewards will apply to the full game.
* Please note that accompanying demos, screenshots and videos all represent a work in progress and not the final product. The playable demo has many placeholder assets/artwork and may contain bugs and/or incomplete features as it is still in pre-alpha state. Most of the screen shots that are showcased were taken in 1080p, and they appear blurry in the thumbnails due to the size difference. Thank you for your patience and understanding.

<p>Journey of Life is a survival game set on an exotic island somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. Bored with everyday life, you decide to go live in nature and produce your own food, water, dishes, etc. You land on an exotic island without anything other than your sharp brain. To make progress in<strong> </strong>the game, you must use basic materials to build more complex items and workstations. The end goal of the game is to build a ship which lets you sail off the island to different regions of the world.</p>
<p>But what is a ship without a crew? Join our crew and get ready for an exciting journey!</p>

<ul><li>I have been a gamer my entire life, but I found that there was always something missing in the gameplay of today's survival games.

<ul><li>All funding will go into programming and developing the rest of the game and creating all the arts and models for it.

<li>The Journey of Life is created by Hyperion Studios in collaboration with Feral Computing from London. </li>
<li>As the owner of Hyperion Studios, I am able to create any 3D or 2D object including all graphics for the game. Adam from Feral Computing is able to give life to all of those objects and he has also already helped three other studios publish their games on Steam. In collaboration, we are able to create any game from scratch.</li>

<p>The only thing preventing us from finishing the game is the fact that our budget is running low. If we got sufficient funding for the game, only the sky would be the limit.</p>

All backers will receive an icon from their pledge, which will be displayed in chat in single player and multiplayer mode. 



The Impact
We have built one of the most advanced systems seen in survival games. With your help, we would be able to create even more detailed stations and the world. 


Risks & Challenges

The Journey of Life is created by Hyperion Studios in collaboration with Feral Computing from London. 
As the owner of Hyperion Studios, I am able to create any 3D or 2D object including all graphics for the game. Adam from Feral Computing is able to give life to all of those objects and he has also already helped three other studios publish their games on Steam. In collaboration, we are able to create any game from scratch.

The only thing preventing us from finishing the game is the fact that our budget is running low. If we got sufficient funding for the game, only the sky would be the limit.

Type: FPS-Single Player with Co-op 
Genre: Simulation, Action, Survival
Tags: Crafting, Exploring, Hunting, Farming, Smelting



Other Ways You Can Help
If you cannot help us finance the game, it would be helpful if you could share this project on your social media profiles to show your support for this project and be able to play the game even sooner.",16.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Our vision for EvoTag</h2>
<p>We want</p>
<ul>
<li>To bring the excitement and variety from first person shooter games outside.</li>
<li>The performance known from professional laser tag equipment, combined with advanced game modes without the need for extra equipment.</li>
<li>To keep it affordable - We want everyone to join the fun.</li>
<li>The freedom to setup games anywhere you want, fast and easy.</li>
<li>To meet new people. Setup public games and discover those close to you. Join in on events like Battle Royale with up to 100 players.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Gameplay</h2>
<p>To accommodate the excitement, competition and strategy known from first person shooter games like Fortnite, Apex Legends and Counter-Strike, we have implemented different arenas and game types. You can set up a game and arena anywhere in no time. There is no limit for how many (or few) players will be able to enter the battlefield!</p>
<h3>The EvoTag App</h3>
<p>You will be able to monitor your health, ammo, inventory and teammates on your smartphone, strapped around your wrist with a wrist band (not included, see FAQ). You can arrange your gear on hot buttons on your screen for quick access.</p>
<p>The game map gives you an overview of bases, loot locations and places to capture.</p>
<p>Sound effects will help you identify nearby loot, incoming airstrikes, when you score a tag, when you are hit by the enemy or when a shot just missed you, etc.</p>
<p>In addition to tagging users you also have the option to use virtual attacks, which adds a complete new element to the game. Is the enemy camping in a strategic location? Take them out with an air strike! You want to setup a stronger defense? Create a minefield with proximity mines! Wonder where the enemy is hiding? Launch a surveillance drone!</p>
<p><strong><i>Backers get a free VIP subscription which forever gives you access to all in-game features!</i></strong><strong><i> </i></strong></p>
<h3>The EvoTagger</h3>
<p>With a futuristic and cool looking EvoTagger you can eliminate your opponents with a burst from point blank range or maybe a single accurate shot from a distance of up to 100 meters (300 ft).</p>
<p>Shots are picked up by several sensors located on the tagger, ensuring a solid hit detection. Ultra-low latency design ensures that you will hear an audio confirmation when you score a tag even before the echo of your shot has died out!</p>
<p>We have included cheat detection which will recognize if players cheat by covering the sensors.</p>
<h2>Current State</h2>
<p>At the moment of launching this campaign (April 2019), we have several working 3D-printed prototypes of the tagger. We are able to connect to both Android and iPhone. We have tested the range and had successful hits at 100 meters (300 ft).</p>
<p>The App can create or join a game and has implemented game map, weapons and equipment, ammo, health, shield, inventory and sound effects. You can choose between games where you win by eliminating all enemies, getting the best score and/or by dominating strategic locations. You can define teams or play free-for-all.</p>
<p>The first 1000 EvoTaggers have already been ordered from our experienced production partner. Electronics design has been finalized and the mechanical design is almost complete.</p>
<p>We have a certified test and certification partners ready to secure all needed approvals for CE- and FCC marking.</p>
<h2>We aim for July 2019</h2>
<p>With this funding campaign, we want to scale the production quickly and get EvoTag to thousands of customers already this summer.</p>
<p>In April and May our production partner is creating production tools and phase 0 units for final approval and certification. In June we expect testing and certification to be completed and real production to start. In July we expect to start shipping the first units to backers.</p>
<p>Concurrently with the hardware production we will finalize the development of the first version of the EvoTag App, including maturing the game play and improving the User Interface. <strong><i>Let us know in the comments section which game modes and features you wish for!</i></strong></p>
<p>By July we will get the product tested and certified to be able to sell in Europe and the US. Later the rest of the world. </p>

You'll play as a sixteen-year-old protagonist who is about to start college in today's online world. During the two academic years, the decisions you make will influence the world around you and affect the social wellbeing of the game's characters.Riscord will never feature the following micro-transactions, ""surprise mechanics"", and or will not have an exclusivity deal with any platform.Riscord's core gameplay focus is on player choice. In Riscord, you'll be sending messages to our characters through direct messages, within servers and other social media platforms. Each message you send and receive has a value associated with it, but you can't be buddies with everyone.You can select a message by either press one, two or three on your keyboard or you can click on it instead but once it's selected it locked in. To immersive you further we've developed a typing mechanic allowing you to type your selected message. Once you've typed your message, you can send it by pressing enter or the send button.Throughout each episode, you'll be making little choices that will impact the overall narrative of the game without even realising it. Remember, the smallest action's do have the most significant consequence.Occasionally you will be faced to make a decision that isn't specifically right or wrong, but both choices will profoundly affect the world around you.At the very start of the game, you need to create your character; you do this by typing a name, username & picking your player avatar. Each avatar currently has three emotions that can change depending on your actions. Your desktop is where the majority of the gameplay takes place. Here you can navigate between apps such as Riscord, Tuneify, V.S.S and Chirp. Each app has unique mechanics, which even includes your desktop. Some of the desktop mechanics are the Taskbar, Start Menu and the Notification Centre, all of which are designed to help you navigate around the device with ease. With each new episode, we plan on expanding the desktop to include more apps such as Vapor, SBox, YourSpace and many more.The Riscord App UI found in the main menu uses the same design as the one found within Short Stories and or any episodes. This allows you to get accustomed to the UI before you start playing the first episode.The options menu isn't just a options menu in Riscord. It also has its own equine mechanics such as two-step verification, connected accounts and blocked accounts. One of which protects you from some of Peters ""hacking"" mechanics and other random events. Furthermore Blocked Accounts allow you to unblock any account that you've blocked, this can have its own consequences so be warned. The help menu uses the same design which is used for Riscord's Server sections of the game, allowing you to get accustomed to the UI before you encounter it.Riscord has been in development for the last two years. Originally it was coursework for Rowan's Level 3 Diploma in Software Development. Since then, Riscord has grown immensely with UI reworks taking place, refining the games code, story revisions, and commissioning original digital art. Last summer an Indie Rock band known as Seagulls hailing from Bucks County, Pennsylvania joined the project bring their musical expertise with them. Music from their debut album Great Pine & their follow up album Thrown Voice, is featured throughout Riscord.Our characters have their own religious beliefs, likes and dislikes, relationships, sexual identities, emotions and social media accounts. This allows us to make our characters feel authentic and relatable, allowing you to build a special bond with each character.The following characters are still being developed and yet to have any artwork drawn and or have their backstories written. However, these characters will still make an appearance.

Riscord has a wide range of player avatars all with their unique look. Several of which are designed to be gender-neutral, allowing you to have more control of their personality and identity. This is just some of the avatar art that is already implemented.As Riscord is an episodic title, we've broken the game down into content phases starting with our first phase ""Welcome Week"". Welcome Week features the first two episodes, as well as our first, Short Story Event, themed around Halloween. Short Stories expand character backstories, new choices and allow you to play as one of our many NPCs. Short Stories gives us a chance to add meaningful new content to the game free of charge. Each Short Story will explore new topics such as World Ocean Day and try new fun mechanics we've been developing.Each content phase has a dedicated patch. These patches will either lay the foundations for further content, bug-fixes and complementary micro-dlc that adds new characters and player avatars to the game.Riscord has many reward tiers, whatever is coloured Purple is included within that reward tier bracket. By utilising crowdfunding, our studio will be able to remain an independent games studio. As of right now, Riscord has two funding sources. One being this Indiegogo campaign and the second being funds raised by successful bids for the following grants
Nottingham Trent University Sustainability Team - Green Dragon Award
Nottingham Trent University - Most Commercially Viable Business
European Union - EU Innovation Funding Grant
At the current time, Riscord's development has been solely reliant on the additional funds raised by these three grants.

An emotional and heartbreaking narrative about love, hopelessness and depression
Beautiful original soundtrack and dreamlike atmosphere

Complex, real characters and relationships based on real-life experiences


Fully voice-acted characters
 Wake up in a mysterious place devoid of all your memories and come upon a recording addressed to you. As you listen, you realize that your mind has been linked to the dreams of a Luke Williams, a man diagnosed with severe depression. You are Luke’s last hope and must prevent him from fading away.Love, Hopelessness, InevitabilityInto A Dream's story is very relatable and my aim is to tell it as close to a real setting as possible. The themes of love, family, hopelessness, inevitability are present in our lives. Even if we have not encountered them personally, most of us know someone who has.Mental Health and DepressionIt is not my intent to say what depression is, or how it is for someone who is suffering from it, but to tell the story of someone whose emotions and reasoning towards the events that were thrown in his life lead him to it.I hope that this understanding of reality can be expanded into a discussion of mental health. I believe that we grow when we observe and empathize. I hope that the characters and events in Into A Dream may feel real and resonate with you. Original SoundtrackThe original soundtrack was composed as a narrative element in each scene, using the piano as the core instrument.  Both its softness and richness can easily translate and depict ourselves and our emotions.It was a perfect match in inspirational story-driven games such as To The Moon or Désirè. However, for most themes, I first finalized the visuals and sound effects of a certain scene, played the level, and let those guide the composition. 



2D Silhouette Simplicity 

The simplicity helps capture the emotion without being too distracting. The colour and lighting gives a sense of darkness in the foreground, where the characters are and the action is occurring, but brightening up into the horizon to depict a certain sense of hope. 

Inspired by LimboFrom the entire visual design process, I've spent the most time on lighting. Limbo was a huge inspiration in the way light is used.  Each layer of each scene has its own lighting to enhance the dreamlike atmosphere.Psychology of ColorThe monochromatic palette of each dream allows for the color to quickly represent the state of mind of this man, whether his feelings or his association with a certain event. The gradient of light, ranging from full black in the foreground to a light shade of color in the background represents his reality. A man living in darkness, but not without a sense of hope.

Into A Dream’s characters are built upon observations. They were created to be as human, as real and as complex as I can understand and put to paper. I am fascinated by people. By how different people react to the same events, how different people have distinct motivations, reasoning and emotions under similar circumstances. To understand why they do so.The characters were modelled after people I have observed, met and known. Instead of writing dialogues whenever I wanted something out of them, their main purpose is to showcase the characters, their personality and their relationships.The events that are depicted in the game are also situations that although not having lived through them personally, I met others who did. John Stevens - Hinted as being a renowned psychologist that was asked to venture into the dreams of Luke in order to find his depression's root cause and help him overcome his darkness. John has no recollections of his past while in these dreams.Luke Williams - A very introverted, quiet, intelligent and driven person. He believes has the responsibility to fix the world, even if beyond his control.Rita Williams - A kind, strong, warm and creative woman. She's a writer and the wife of Luke.Anne Williams - Witty, curious, very bright. Anne has a strong bond with her father, Luke. She appears between 9 and 12 years old throughout Luke's dreams.Isabel Williams - Luke's loving mother. Isabel is quite similar in personality to her granddaughter, Anne. They have a great bond and seem very alike.Michael Gall - Luke's best friend and partner in his business. Michael is funny, loud, extroverted and somewhat moody. Luke Williams is a father, supports a loving wife and is very close with his mother. Outside of his family life, Luke is an entrepreneur, having created a clean energy start-up with his best friend. Everything was going well in his life until some terrible news which lead to a downward spiral of unfortunate events.Delve deep into Luke’s dreams, where memories and symbols are blended together; you are expected to disclose the events and actions that have led Luke to his darkness. Meet his close family and friends, and find ways to access his darker dreams. Unveil the emotional, powerful and heartbreaking journey of his life. Help Luke see that his life matters. Into A Dream came to be as a somewhat impulsive decision. After working as an engineer for almost 5 years I came to the conclusion that it was not the path that I was most passionate about. I resigned from my job and started looking for different career paths.In the meantime I finally decided to download Unity and learn some game development without the conscious intent to actually pursue that path. However, after the first tutorials my storytelling bug took over and I decided to make a prototype. From that prototype, Into A Dream came to life.Take a look at the prototype:


Into A Dream is already close to be completely developed. All voice acting has been recorded, mixed and added into the game. It will be released in July 2020, without any funding necessary for its completion.  No risk of not getting the completed game! 
This Indiegogo is to raise money for the currently volunteering voice-actors, localization, and communication/promotion. I would like to have the game translated to multiple languages, such as Spanish, German, French, Italian, Russian, Japanese and Chinese. I've had a lot of emotional support and feedback from the Into A Dream community throughout development and would like to offer this opportunity to get exclusive rewards and experiences, and being the first to play!

<p><b>So, what's Deep Space Patrol (DSP) ?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">2014 summer I started my adventure with Swift and loved it from the beginning. From day one I wanted to make this game.

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center;"">Game mechanic is working as intended. There are few tweaks and better graphic, sound and music to be made. Also most levels are in basic state and need some polishing and testing. </span></p>

Hi, my name is Tomek Soroka. I am engineer and project manager working for about ten years in R&D deparaments. Always had passion for games, started playing 26 years ago. I am learning to code even as You read this. From my early computer days wanted to make my own game. I love to make 3d graphic and music. Since 2014 I discovered that programming is not so hard this days. Last year started small indie studio called Sortech Studio. You can check our apps in Appstore

Eagle's Eye Free - https://itunes.apple.com/pl/app/eagles-eye-free/id951758977?l=pl&mt=8
                              


So, what's Deep Space Patrol (DSP) ?
2014 summer I started my adventure with Swift and loved it from the beginning. From day one I wanted to make this game. After learning something about coding decided to start with DSP. It was May 2015. After few months of development we can share some of my work. 
Game mechanic is working as intended. There are few tweaks and better graphic, sound and music to be made. Also most levels are in basic state and need some polishing and testing. 
Game is developed for iOS mobile devices. It will be free.
It took me some time to get this working as intended and at this moment we are confident about release. But would also love to make this game evolving experience for players. And most of all would love to make graphic and music as was intended at the beginning. 
For this I humbly ask for Your aid. I choose Flexible Funding because game will be released whether the rise end with $1 or $23,800. More money means better quality of product and more content. And I hope we can build this together.
After initial release we plan to create additional content which will be provided as a free DLCs.
You can check full list of features on our website but here is some recap:
•Online gameplay,
•4 flyable ships in initial release: Corvette, Frigate, Destroyer and Cruiser,
•Independent steering for turrets on right and left side of ship (check video below to see it in action),
•Fast paced arcade fun,
•Story driven campaign – discover secrets and enemies in more than 300 unique systems,
•Fabular and random systems,
•Unique bosses and final fights,
•Player ranks and experience,
•Resources to collect – 3He and Titan,
•More than 200 ship upgrades,
•Mission boosters,
•Unique music score (check demo below),
•And the best of all: lots of fun !

Risk involved
DSP release is planned as soon as it is finished and tested. I've planned production with my best knowledge and experience. Investing passion for games and time is best solution to counter all risks that may arise.
Schedule breakdown below:








As you can see, plan is ambitious but possible.


How it works:
Game will be released on iOS platform (mostly mobile devices, although we will test  possibility for implementation on TV and Mac). iOS supported version at this moment is 8.0+ but it may be subject to change if there is real need in framework. 
After initial release we will explore possibilities for Android and Windows versions. 




What do we need this cash for ?
First of all we need better equipment to render 3d graphic and more time for license of 3d software (which is major cost).
Next thing is video and music edition software. 
Hardware and software takes almost  80% of budget. 


Budget break down:









What Donors will get ?
First, opportunity to be part of something special.
Next, rewards:
For everyone - free access to game and all content including future DLCs.
For donors, to honor their aid we created perks described below:

                                                    


















All Donors will be credited in game.
All names are pending for approval (no offensive material).
All tests will be carried out on mobile devices with iOS 8.0+ installed and ready for TestFlight.

How I know you will not run with My money ?
I want to make a living of game design so running with cash is not possible. Also I'm investing my time and money for this project already.

<p>eQubes’
mission is to entertain and challenge its players to test their mathematical
skills to the limit, while the clock is ticking. eQubes is a revolutionary game
when it comes to the selection of mathematical logic games that are out there.
In addition to its playful side, while training the brain, you’ll also help
<b>stimulate the development </b>and<b> strengthening of various cognitive skills</b>, such
as logical and mathematical reasoning, manual dexterity, concentration and
memory... skills that can be reinforced by eQubes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As fun as it
is challenging, once you start the game, the hard part will be stopping! Why? Because
there are so many equations to be solved while the clock is ticking.</p>

<p>Hi! My name
is João Lima, and I’m a student at the Faculty of Engineering, in the
University of Porto, and the brain behind eQubes.</p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p>My enthusiasm for programming and games sparked the desire to create
eQubes. Several ideas have helped create a <b>universally understood game</b> that
challenges users to reach the last level! We created an appealing design and a simple
and intuitive interface. From paper to computer and from the computer to the
App Store, eQubes registered very few changes, only improvements!</p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p>The game’s development was
done in partnership with BloomIdea, a Portuguese company specialized in developing
mobile applications that saw its potential and decided to bet on this
revolutionary and challenging game.</p>

<h2>Endless</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The eQubes challenge is going to be <b>even greater </b>and <b>even faster</b>. We are
going to implement a game mode where players will only have 10-15 seconds to
solve mathematical equations. And for those who think that the eQubes challenge
can come to an end, think again! Every time a cube’s equations are completed,
the player gains a few more seconds and other equations will appear, hence the
reason it’s endless.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>Marketing</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p>We are going to invest
significantly in marketing eQubes. We want more players to <b>discover </b>and

Story
Revolutionary and challenging, eQubes is the perfect game for those who love numbers and puzzles. The game challenges players to train their brain through mathematical equations and logic that they must solve in a race against the clock.
 
The success
of eQubes goes way beyond the challenge that attracts its users. The game
combines the universal language of numbers with an appealing design and a
simple and intuitive interface, which invites anyone, of any age, to play. eQubes
is unique and there is no other app like it for training mathematical reasoning
in such a fun and challenging way.The game
Equations and cubes were the inspiration for eQubes. The game has dozens of challenging levels and each one is comprised of 6 faces, which represent the 6 faces of a cube.

The gameplay
With only a
few minutes to solve each face’s equations, the player must really love puzzles
in order to solve these mental calculations... all this while racing against
the clock! We must warn
you though: it's addictive and you won’t be aware of how fast time flies by!
The more equations you solve, the more eQubes
you win.
Game currencyThe game currency are eQubes. Through the course of the game you’ll be able to win them or you can purchase them (although we want you to be able to play it without spending any money!) 

You’ll be able to use them to gain time in harder puzzles, get a solution when you feel
like quitting and a lot of other stuff that we want to implement, like seeing the solutions you were unable to solve, for example.






Mission


eQubes’
mission is to entertain and challenge its players to test their mathematical
skills to the limit, while the clock is ticking. eQubes is a revolutionary game
when it comes to the selection of mathematical logic games that are out there.
In addition to its playful side, while training the brain, you’ll also help
stimulate the development and strengthening of various cognitive skills, such
as logical and mathematical reasoning, manual dexterity, concentration and
memory... skills that can be reinforced by eQubes.

As fun as it
is challenging, once you start the game, the hard part will be stopping! Why? Because
there are so many equations to be solved while the clock is ticking.





Game
developers

Hi! My name
is João Lima, and I’m a student at the Faculty of Engineering, in the
University of Porto, and the brain behind eQubes.


My enthusiasm for programming and games sparked the desire to create
eQubes. Several ideas have helped create a universally understood game that
challenges users to reach the last level! We created an appealing design and a simple
and intuitive interface. From paper to computer and from the computer to the
App Store, eQubes registered very few changes, only improvements!


The game’s development was
done in partnership with BloomIdea, a Portuguese company specialized in developing
mobile applications that saw its potential and decided to bet on this
revolutionary and challenging game.






Campaign


eQubes has been unstoppable when it comes to
challenging its thousands of players and fans. After conquering 1st place in
the App Store for iPhone and iPad in Portugal, we have been working hard on the
next stages of the game, in order to continue to surprise those who love
numbers and puzzles.


Believe us when we say that we’re very excited about
eQubes and we want everything that was planned for this campaign to happen. If
you share this feeling, help us make it happen!


The eQubes campaign aims to:




Have eQubes on
Android and Windows platforms


Provide new game modes such as Multiplayer and Endless.


Investment in marketing



Other platforms


We want to break down platform
barriers! With eQubes on other platforms, many players can have fun testing
their mathematical skills to the limit, while racing against time.



Multiplayer

eQubes’ gameplay will be even
better. We’re going to make it even more fun and interactive! It will be
amazing to see friends, family and players from all around the world
challenging each other.




Endless

The eQubes challenge is going to be even greater and even faster. We are
going to implement a game mode where players will only have 10-15 seconds to
solve mathematical equations. And for those who think that the eQubes challenge
can come to an end, think again! Every time a cube’s equations are completed,
the player gains a few more seconds and other equations will appear, hence the
reason it’s endless.

Marketing

We are going to invest
significantly in marketing eQubes. We want more players to discover and
experience eQubes and hope that these can contribute to the evolution of the
game, making it increasingly challenging and fun.




Perks
First of all
thank you for your contribution! Your contribution is very important so that eQubes can become a better and more challenging game!
Help us and receive exclusive stuff and awesome gifts!











What if we
don't reach the goal?
If this
happens we will invest the money we raised in the following order:



Bring eQubes
to other platforms such as Android and windows


Make new
game mods like Multiplayer and endless mod.


Invest in
marketing





Risks

eQubes was developed by people who believe in
its potential. We have many plans and we know what we need and what the cost is
to develop them. We work with a ton of enthusiasm and we are always learning
and implementing improvements, so that the eQubes challenges just keep getting
better and more fun.

You can’t contribute? No problem!

eQubes is a game that has been spreading by ""word of
mouth"". You know that friend who downloaded a game, told another friend
about it and challenged about 5 more friends to play? eQubes has that effect on
its players. It's surprising! And the number of downloads just keeps growing.
People really love eQubes!

</span></span></b><b>CATFLAP! - and Japster's Cavern / Background</b></p>
<p><br/>
Hi guys - Really hoping that you can help the little guy / indie developer!</p>Coming from the 80's bedroom coding scene, first on my trusty Spectrum, then my
C64, I've really missed developing/creating fun games...

<p>...So, about 18 months ago, I decided to give old-school mobile game
development a try!<br/>
</p><p>Before we start, please, PLEASE do not think I'm trying to get support for yet another 'Flappy B*rd game - My game is honestly *massively* different in terms of gameplay, longevity, skills rewards, etc! - If you're dubious, please download the free tryout/trial version to confirm and hopefully come on side, then come back here!  :)<br/><br/>
Okay, now that that's out of the way! - about 10 months ago, after getting to grips with it, I had created 'CATFLAP!' -
a real labour of love game, and one that's taken every bit of my spare time,
developing into the small hours of the morning to add features, humorous
touches, tweak the gameplay, achievements, high score tables, add a HD overhaul,
etc, and has evolved into a very fun, addictive, and risk'n'reward
style gameplay skill game.  (Note, it has pipes, but contrary to first
impressions, it's NOT yet another Flappy Bird clone!)</p>
<p>However, I've become steadily more and more disheartened/disillusioned
at the lack of notice, downloads and publicity that it is getting,
even after releasing an upgradeable  'LITE' version for absolutely no cost, containing
almost all features of the full version (which even then only cost the absolute
minimum I was allowed to make it - I wanted to charge less) - which was only 50
pence for Android, and 79p / $0.99 for iOS)</p>
<p>Having paid 2 years' worth of software license fees, developer
fees, and money for suitable hardware to develop on, I'm already out of pocket for just under £2,000, uncountable hours of lost family/relaxation time, and only have a
few (literally a few dozen) installations,
yet virtually EVERYONE who's downloaded it and reviewed it loves it and has rated it
highly!<br/>
<br/>
CATFLAP! has had SO much work poured into making it better and better,
long-life, etc, that there really is a solid, fun challenge! - 8-Rank High
Score tables for ALL 26+ modes, and over 80 (80!!) local achievements to get,
ranging from getting clever scores and combos, to how long you can last in a
single game, to catching (or even missing!) large amounts of butterflies in a
row, Rufus, etc! - MASSIVE replayability as you attempt to get certain tricky
jewel combo's, achievements, etc!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have nowhere near enough money to invest in advertising
to compete with the generic-IAP-heavy big-boys, but I really want to make this
game development dream work and maybe help pay the bills. (I'm also not a 1-hit-wonder (currently working on a second, completely different genre of game already, sneak peek screenshot attached!), and I also have around a dozen or so ideas for other games, including an idea for a
Pentamino-featuring board-game puzzler that I KNOW will be fantastically
playable - early family-and-friends testing confirms this!  :) )</p>
<p>Given the effort involved in creating an in-depth, polished game, I
really can't afford to take a chance with another 3-4 months of my life per
game, late nights/early morning finishes, and renewing my software license, without at least seeing that it's worth spending that time creating it -
that I am RIGHT about CATFLAP! being a great game, and there still being a market for
great, fun, none-generic/cloned games and none-IAP-greedy developers.... 
:(</p><p>There are a number of ways in which you can help me out, ranging from either just downloading the game and trying it, through to a simple (and much-appreciated) £1, £2, or £5, pledge/contribution towards my advertising if you think my participation and games in the indie scene are worth supporting!<br/><br/>If I can get a healthy amount of advertising revenue via this campaign, (and manage to establish my 'studio' name/quality for the benefit of future releases!),  (ALL of the contributions will be used for advertising), then if my game does well, I will be giving an ongoing 10% BACK, to the fantastic GamesAid Charity!</p><p>I've chosen a flexible campaign in case ongoing support or investment is forthcoming (you never know!)</p><p>PS! - CATFLAP! FULL is currently FREE for TEN DAYS, starting from tomorrow, so grab the full version while you can, and please, if you like it, rate it/review it? - Cheers guys!<br/><br/></p>
<p><b><span>2.<span> 
</span></span></b><b>What I Need, &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>Well, I need to try to get CATFLAP! recognised for what it IS - a fun,
long-lasting challenge casual game for ALL ages (yes, even adults too!), with lots of
rewards for skillful play.  In addition to this, hopefully a means to help make life a little
more financially secure for myself and my family, and keep me creating fun mobile games.</p>
<p>What YOU can get from helping me realise my dream:-</p>
<ul>
<li>A chance
     to make my games come to life! - to proudly say ""I helped this great
     little game take off, and I'm a supporter of/hero to small indie developers!"" - hopefully trying out CATFLAP! will let
     you see that I CAN make fun games, that I pour my heart into making them,
     and that I will only get better and faster at it!<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>A chance
     to help GAMES AID - I'll be donating a fixed percentage (10%) of any income I might receive, when I manage to gain
     momentum, to this most worthwhile charity cause.<br/>
</li>
</ul><p><br/></p>
<p><b><span>3.<span> 
</span></span></b><b>The Impact That Your Help Will Have</b></p>
<p>Any financial help towards getting the word out there, via KNOWN,
REPUTABLE advertising routes will help CATFLAP! gain momentum, and hopefully
help it take off, showing that there IS still a market for original ideas/content in the
small, 1-2 person indie developers' market, and so help me put my heart and soul into
creating more great games!</p>
<ul>
<li>You'll be
     helping a struggling, ethical indie developer to get their games recognised,
     and perhaps balance up the glut of greedy repeat-IAP-consumable-only powered
     games that won't allow you to buy the GAME, but instead require you to buy
     IAP after IAP after IAP, just to stand a chance of getting some enjoyment
     out of the game!</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>If I get enough support, I'll invest the time to set up and publish/port the game (and future games) to other platforms (Fire, TV, Tizen, Windows 8/10, etc), and Apple Watch even, if do-able!<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>You'll be
     helping the fantastic GAMES AID charity, when any revenue comes in.
      In short, you're ultimately giving MORE than your initial pledge to charity, if
     CATFLAP! becomes successful enough!</li>
</ul>
<ul><li>I honestly
     believe that without the crowdfunding community's help, I simply cannot
     make any progress in this industry, being unable to promote my game or get it downloaded, as EVERY review
     site I have tried wants money to assure a (possibly unseen by the
     mainstream public) review, and they want LOTS of it.  So instead, I'd
     rather use your contributions to promote directly, via social media
     advertising (Facebook, Twitter, etc), reputable review site advertising,
     and generally any advertising option that has a proven impact/result with
     promoting apps.</li></ul><ul><li>Of course, if this campaign is successful, I'll add even more features, and invest more time into making CATFLAP even better! - ie. Online achievements / leaderboards, etc (currently they're local ones, restricted to your installation of CATFLAP, etc...)...</li></ul>
<p><b><span><br/>4.<span> 
</span></span></b><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>There is of course the risk that I don't receive enough (or even ANY!)
support. </p>
<p>Hopefully you can plainly see that there is absolutely NO risk that this
is a turkey, and that I CAN create more great games / that I have proven that
I bring something fun and addictive to the mobile gaming community, and soon, Windows 8+ gaming
community, with my first game!</p>
<p>Obviously, gaining NO support whatsoever pretty much kills off my chances
of ever getting my game recognised/name established for any future games, but
in the event that we DO collectively succeed in making 'CATFLAP!' the success
that I think it really deserves to be, then this would be a great advert for the
power of Crowdfunding, faith in the small/indie developer, and the kindness of
like-minded strangers!</p>
<p>I KNOW that given a chance, my development and game design skills
will allow me to unleash some more really cool, much-loved games on mobile devices,
Windows 8, etc!</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b><span>5.<span> 
</span></span></b><b>Other Great Ways You Can Help Me Out!</b></p>
<p>Of course, financial help isn't everything! - the primary focus of this
campaign is to get the word out there so that people can try (and hopefully
LOVE!) my CATFLAP! game, spurring me on to create more original games, and
continue doing something I love, whilst at the same time hopefully helping to
pay my family's bills by either buying the full version, or upgrading the trial/tryout version!... </p>
<p>So, please, PLEASE, regardless of whether you can or can't help directly with funding, I'd be HUGELY appreciative if you could possibly just do one (or even more than one/all!) of the

<p>Willard Rouse is an ordinary 17-year high school student who is often by himself. By accident, he discovered that he is a spirit bearer, one who could summon and use the power of spirits. After getting kicked out of Rainvalley Academy, he transferred to Ficaso Academy. Much to his surprise, Willard found himself in the company of great friends at Ficaso which led him to think that he could finally enjoy his years in high school without being misunderstood. However, Ficaso Academy is not what it appears to be. Willard started to have suspicions when he learned that the school prohibits students to make contact with the outside world until they graduate. Eventually, Willard realized that all the students in Ficaso are spirit bearers but they are unable to summon their spirits due to spirit jammers strategically placed around the academy. What secrets lie beneath the walls of Ficaso Academy? What challenges await Willard and his friends in their quest to escape?</p>
<p>Discover the secrets of Ficaso Academy; learn more about Shades, creatures who devour the souls of spirit bearers, and meet the powerful Spirits that could be summoned by Willard and his friends. Watch Willard hone his spirit powers and develop his relationships with the people around him!</p>

Willard Rouse is an ordinary 17-year high school student who is often by himself. By accident, he discovered that he is a spirit bearer, one who could summon and use the power of spirits. After getting kicked out of Rainvalley Academy, he transferred to Ficaso Academy. Much to his surprise, Willard found himself in the company of great friends at Ficaso which led him to think that he could finally enjoy his years in high school without being misunderstood. However, Ficaso Academy is not what it appears to be. Willard started to have suspicions when he learned that the school prohibits students to make contact with the outside world until they graduate. Eventually, Willard realized that all the students in Ficaso are spirit bearers but they are unable to summon their spirits due to spirit jammers strategically placed around the academy. What secrets lie beneath the walls of Ficaso Academy? What challenges await Willard and his friends in their quest to escape?
Discover the secrets of Ficaso Academy; learn more about Shades, creatures who devour the souls of spirit bearers, and meet the powerful Spirits that could be summoned by Willard and his friends. Watch Willard hone his spirit powers and develop his relationships with the people around him!

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Short Summary</h2>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Who are we?</span></h3>
<p>My name is Christopher Larue and I am the founder and president of Attainable Entertainment Inc, headquartered in downtown Sudbury Ontario Canada. I am an entrepreneur with a history of game development, graphic design, web development, 3D art and junior animation. I wear a lot of hats! </p>
<p><strong>I started this online video game company for a few reasons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Every year, thousands of university/college graduates are pouring out of school with barely any experience they need to get hired by a major studio OR they do but still aren't getting hired because competition is so high</li>
<li>AAA game engines are free to use and there is no more pay wall to use them, also because of that there is now a ton of resource material (tutorials) to help someone learn how to use the engines. </li>
<li>Digital distribution makes getting a game on the market much more easier than the past. </li>
<li>People want to work from home or on the road in a RV, Sailboat or cabin in the woods.  </li>
<li>The culture of collaboration is in full swing (think github)</li>
<li>Some developers want to start getting paid based on game sales.  </li>
<li>It takes a long time to make a game because studios only have so much staff ($). An online studio could yield a few thousand devs on a single project. Meaning games <i>may</i> be finished faster (which gives us a competitive edge if we do it right)</li>
<li>It's WAY cheaper to run an online studio then a physically based one. Which means less lay offs and more creative freedom. </li>
<li>In 2017 the internet is everywhere and people already know how to use it effectively</li>
<li>Video games are the future of digital entertainment be it VR, AR or traditional. They are here to stay and only get bigger and better. </li>
<li>Making a game alone is hard, simple as that. Having teammates makes it easier!</li>
</ul>
<p>I started small and launched v1.0 of the website and system back in November 2016. I gathered 22 developers from all around Canada and started to work on a PC horror game. That game is now in production and moving along which gave me confidence to create the upgraded v2.0 with further reach, improved systems and more accessibility.</p>
<p>Concept art for the PC horror game below: </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What the campaign is about and why it's important</h3>
<p>This campaign is about raising money to help build a online video game studio that developers from all skill levels can join and make games that leave us laughing, empowered to even weeping for years to come. Why is it important? We (you and me) are making this for developers that want to start or grow in fields such as...</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490222834/evemoizflhke0pertr2v.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The magnitude of what you will help us achieve</h3>
<p>By getting behind this campaign with your contribution you will allow this studio to potentially become a major player in the industry. We are starting off humble, slow, with a small office but with support from you and others, this studio will create jobs, games, careers, friendships and maybe even romance! Heck, you might meet your future lover by working on or playing a game we make! ""Whooaaaa""-Keanu Reeves. </p>

<h3>Lawyer</h3>
<p>I need to get a lawyer to adjust my current agreement and expand on the straight commission compensation. Currently contractors only get paid for a full year 12 months after game sales, I would like to lengthen that time to a few years. Also, I need the agreement to cover more international law. I also need a few other legal forms. </p>
<h3>Website Developer/Network Admin</h3>
<p>The web dev will be contracted to assist me in creating a smooth functioning website with all the bells and whistles I originally intended the site and system to have. </p>
<h3>Concept Artist</h3>
<p>When developers join the projects they will need to understand what the game theme is and the general direction we want it to go. Concept art also gets the creative juices flowing and devs excited to work on the projects. I have a great artist that is doing great work and I would like to compensate him for his fantastic work and dedication to the studio.</p>
<p><strong>Below is some of the concept art for some <u>upcoming projects</u> that we will open with. You can tell he is a talented guy!</strong></p>

<h3>Accountant </h3>
<p>To assist me with the new payment plan set up and doing research on international systems. Also to assist with bookkeeping services as well, especially after an Indiegogo campaign.   </p>
<h3>Servers</h3>
<p>Of course we need bigger safe and secure servers to run the subversion system as well as the website. Also to save multiple copies of the games we produce. </p>
<h3>Web Domain SSL</h3>
<p>To ensure safety in our web traffic, we need an SSL certificate. </p>
<h3>Office</h3>
<p>This is to upgrade office equipment such as the main computer. The main computer this business is running on is getting outdated and to keep up with the games we create I need a new rig so I can test and greenlight them. Also helps with office rent too. </p>
<h3>Indiegogo</h3>
<p>Using Indiegogo for a crowdfunding method I need to factor in their 5% fee on transactions into the budget. So naturally I added it to the calculation. (They suggest I do this)</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">PERKS!</h2>
<p>Oh boy, it's perk time! I tried to incorporate fun perks that will enable you to help the campaign as well as help future game creation!

Short Summary
Who are we?
My name is Christopher Larue and I am the founder and president of Attainable Entertainment Inc, headquartered in downtown Sudbury Ontario Canada. I am an entrepreneur with a history of game development, graphic design, web development, 3D art and junior animation. I wear a lot of hats! 
I started this online video game company for a few reasons:

Every year, thousands of university/college graduates are pouring out of school with barely any experience they need to get hired by a major studio OR they do but still aren't getting hired because competition is so high
AAA game engines are free to use and there is no more pay wall to use them, also because of that there is now a ton of resource material (tutorials) to help someone learn how to use the engines. 
Digital distribution makes getting a game on the market much more easier than the past. 
People want to work from home or on the road in a RV, Sailboat or cabin in the woods.  
The culture of collaboration is in full swing (think github)
Some developers want to start getting paid based on game sales.  
It takes a long time to make a game because studios only have so much staff ($). An online studio could yield a few thousand devs on a single project. Meaning games may be finished faster (which gives us a competitive edge if we do it right)
It's WAY cheaper to run an online studio then a physically based one. Which means less lay offs and more creative freedom. 
In 2017 the internet is everywhere and people already know how to use it effectively
Video games are the future of digital entertainment be it VR, AR or traditional. They are here to stay and only get bigger and better. 
Making a game alone is hard, simple as that. Having teammates makes it easier!

I started small and launched v1.0 of the website and system back in November 2016. I gathered 22 developers from all around Canada and started to work on a PC horror game. That game is now in production and moving along which gave me confidence to create the upgraded v2.0 with further reach, improved systems and more accessibility.
Concept art for the PC horror game below: 

What the campaign is about and why it's important
This campaign is about raising money to help build a online video game studio that developers from all skill levels can join and make games that leave us laughing, empowered to even weeping for years to come. Why is it important? We (you and me) are making this for developers that want to start or grow in fields such as...

The magnitude of what you will help us achieve
By getting behind this campaign with your contribution you will allow this studio to potentially become a major player in the industry. We are starting off humble, slow, with a small office but with support from you and others, this studio will create jobs, games, careers, friendships and maybe even romance! Heck, you might meet your future lover by working on or playing a game we make! ""Whooaaaa""-Keanu Reeves. 
What We Need & What You Get


Lawyer
I need to get a lawyer to adjust my current agreement and expand on the straight commission compensation. Currently contractors only get paid for a full year 12 months after game sales, I would like to lengthen that time to a few years. Also, I need the agreement to cover more international law. I also need a few other legal forms. 
Website Developer/Network Admin
The web dev will be contracted to assist me in creating a smooth functioning website with all the bells and whistles I originally intended the site and system to have. 
Concept Artist
When developers join the projects they will need to understand what the game theme is and the general direction we want it to go. Concept art also gets the creative juices flowing and devs excited to work on the projects. I have a great artist that is doing great work and I would like to compensate him for his fantastic work and dedication to the studio.
Below is some of the concept art for some upcoming projects that we will open with. You can tell he is a talented guy!



Accountant 
To assist me with the new payment plan set up and doing research on international systems. Also to assist with bookkeeping services as well, especially after an Indiegogo campaign.   
Servers
Of course we need bigger safe and secure servers to run the subversion system as well as the website. Also to save multiple copies of the games we produce. 
Web Domain SSL
To ensure safety in our web traffic, we need an SSL certificate. 
Office
This is to upgrade office equipment such as the main computer. The main computer this business is running on is getting outdated and to keep up with the games we create I need a new rig so I can test and greenlight them. Also helps with office rent too. 
Indiegogo
Using Indiegogo for a crowdfunding method I need to factor in their 5% fee on transactions into the budget. So naturally I added it to the calculation. (They suggest I do this)
PERKS!
Oh boy, it's perk time! I tried to incorporate fun perks that will enable you to help the campaign as well as help future game creation! Plus as a gamer, it would be cool to see your stuff in game! Also, since we are coming at you when we need you the most, all these perks are for every game the studio completes. I figure that offers the best value for your buck, it's a limited time offer so I might as well make it worth your while!

Stretch Goals!

Where do the funds go if we don't reach our entire goal?
If we don't reach our goal, whatever bit of money that gets passed down will be prioritized and put where it needs to go first (web/system design). I already have a solid foundation from v1.0 so things will move along, just more slowly. 

The Impact
The impact a successful campaign would have is pretty monumental for multiple reasons;

People will have a studio that accepts them and gives them a real chance to prove themselves in this industry. 
We make games that sell and with every game sold we put 5% towards our Cause, Cure and Invention system. We can donate to communities, medical research and inventors so they get the funding they need. Making the world a better place in the long term. 
""Money where your mouth is"" development ability. Meaning that if our games are taking to long to make, jump in the pit and help the game move forward.  This is a unique ability other studios don't exercise.  
Straight commission means that developers can potentially make more (much more) money then the traditional salary model. Thus getting paid fairly for the hard work.  
Potential to make franchise hits that are remembered for ages! 
Possibly change the way the other industry studios run their studio.

<p>So were we.</p>
<p>That's why, 3 years ago, we started building FireJumpers.</p>
<p>We were just a 2-person indie team. But we were <a href=""#inspiration"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">inspired</a> by the grit and heroism displayed by wildland firefighters - battling massive fires to save lives and property - with some very cool equipment!</p>
<p>Our first wildfire game was <strong><a href=""http://redbloxgames.com/wildfire-rts.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FireJumpers Wildfire RTS</a></strong>. In this paid, single-player game, the player fights wildfires in locales around the world, from Malibu to Hong Kong. It was a success on Android and iOS, with an average rating of more than 4.5 out of 5.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1263522/files/20150302194511-Wildfire-RTS-Screenshot.jpg?1425354311"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p><p>That's when we got a call from a Canadian wildland firefighting agency asking us to build them an Air Attack Officer training simulation. This became <strong><a href=""http://redbloxgames.com/ats/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FireJumpers<sup>Pro</sup> ATS (Aerial Training Simulator)</a></strong>, which features a multi-player feature for remote training. </p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1263532/files/20150302195447-FireJumpersPRO-Screenshot.jpg?1425354887"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>Multi-player was so much fun that we brought the feature back to mobile gamers with <strong><a href=""http://redbloxgames.com/sandbox.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FireJumpers Sandbox</a></strong>. In this ""sandbox"", players set up their own wildfire scenarios by choosing a map, specifying the fire location and wind speed/direction, and then inviting other players to join them in fighting the fire.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1263543/files/20150302200029-FireJumpersSandbox-Screenshot.jpg?1425355229"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>The new game, <strong>FireJumpers Inferno</strong>, will incorporate many of the features already developed for Sandbox, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sophisticated real-time fire simulation that burns differently each time (depending on terrain and wind)</li>
<li>Multi-player (allows a team to tackle the largest fires)</li>
<li>""Walkie-Talkie"" button (for real-time communication with the team)</li>
<li>Air units (helicopters, water bombers, retardant bombers)</li>
<li>Ground units (cut teams, hose teams, bulldozers, engines, brush trucks, smokejumpers)
</li>
<li>Civilian units</li>
<li>25 maps from around the world</li>
</ul>
<p>But that's just the beginning...</p>
<p> <strong>FireJumpers Inferno</strong> will super-charge the wildfire fighting gamer experience, and <b>we'd like to invite you to be part of the adventure</b>!</p>

<br/>Credit: USDA<p></p></div>","Tired of war, ninjas and zombies?

So were we.
That's why, 3 years ago, we started building FireJumpers.
We were just a 2-person indie team. But we were inspired by the grit and heroism displayed by wildland firefighters - battling massive fires to save lives and property - with some very cool equipment!
Our first wildfire game was FireJumpers Wildfire RTS. In this paid, single-player game, the player fights wildfires in locales around the world, from Malibu to Hong Kong. It was a success on Android and iOS, with an average rating of more than 4.5 out of 5.
That's when we got a call from a Canadian wildland firefighting agency asking us to build them an Air Attack Officer training simulation. This became FireJumpersPro ATS (Aerial Training Simulator), which features a multi-player feature for remote training. 
Multi-player was so much fun that we brought the feature back to mobile gamers with FireJumpers Sandbox. In this ""sandbox"", players set up their own wildfire scenarios by choosing a map, specifying the fire location and wind speed/direction, and then inviting other players to join them in fighting the fire.
The new game, FireJumpers Inferno, will incorporate many of the features already developed for Sandbox, including:

Sophisticated real-time fire simulation that burns differently each time (depending on terrain and wind)
Multi-player (allows a team to tackle the largest fires)
""Walkie-Talkie"" button (for real-time communication with the team)
Air units (helicopters, water bombers, retardant bombers)
Ground units (cut teams, hose teams, bulldozers, engines, brush trucks, smokejumpers)

Civilian units
25 maps from around the world

But that's just the beginning...
 FireJumpers Inferno will super-charge the wildfire fighting gamer experience, and we'd like to invite you to be part of the adventure!
New Features for FireJumpers Inferno:
BUILD YOUR TEAM:


  Unit experience will be recorded

Unit upgrade system

Leaderboards for the most experienced units and players


  ""Request Reinforcements"" feature


CHALLENGING SCENARIOS:


Scenarios including maps, fire, and weather (pre-built and build-your-own)
More and bigger maps
Fuel for bombers and helicopters

 ""Wildfire Weekend"" tournaments

SOCIAL:

Create a team of friends
Notifications when friends are playing

 Invite friends to private games
Play against other teams


MORE UNITS:



  More ground units (e.g. hotshots, transport trucks)


  More air units (e.g. P3 retardant bomber)


Police unit to direct traffic



  MUSIC & SOUND EFFECTS:


Adaptive music (changes based on the action)


Improved sound effects



...and for the Pros:
Professional wildland firefighters are some of our biggest fans and for many of you, FireJumpers is more than just a game - it's also a training tool. That's why we are planning some special features for you:
IMPROVED FIRE MODEL:


Hidden hotspots or wetspots (where fire blazes ahead or slows down)
  
Different types of trees (pines, redwoods, etc.)

Back-burning  
Terrain steepness
Rain and humidity


PROFESSIONAL UNITS:

Large water tanker (ground unit) to help replenish other water units
Water units (hose team, engines, etc.) will have to refill periodically.
Fire hydrants
Controlled-burn unit
Light water bomber
DC-10 Retardant Bomber
P3 Super Retardant Bomber
747 bomber

TRAINING ROOM OPTIONS:


Support for generating maps from real locations (with ArcGIS)  


Improved map editor  

Ability to save custom maps
Ability to slow down/speed up time

<b>The Infected will come in 4 classes.<br/><br/><strong><u>Infected</u></strong> - </b>This is your standard infected carrier.

Strong biters and can quickly over come a survivor when encounter in large numbers.<br/><br/><strong style=""font-weight: bold;""><u>Giggler </u></strong><b>- </b>Gigglers have reached the pinnacle of madness, the virus has completely stripped the person of all humanity. Extremely strong and fast on there feet. You know a Gigglers around by their eerie and indistinguishably Giggling, the moment a Giggler has sight of you, they will never stop chasing you until either you or it are dead. Gigglers tend to pounce and swarm there targets with a rapid succession of bites, scratches and blows to the body.<br/><br/><b>Bloater - </b>Bloaters are large husks of flesh that once was a person. Now they are filled with nothing but vile contiguous bile. The moment a Bloater has sight of you it begin to charge at you, and once it has you within its grasp it will start a chemical reaction within the Bloater that will ultimately end with it exploding and releasing all its contiguous bile upon anyone or anything around its area of effect. Its best to dispose of them quickly and at a distance.<br/><br/><u style=""font-weight: bold;"">Roider</u><b> </b><strong style=""font-weight: bold;"">- </strong>Roiders are a special breed of infected, they have managed to contract a rare mutated form of the virus that has altered there genetic makeup. They poses almost super human strength. Roiders are the most dangerous class, and will usually take more then 1 person to bring down. When Roiders are aware of your presence, they give off a terrifying shriek that alerts all other infected with a given radius, making your fight all that tougher.<br/>

<p>As with any multiplayer online game, creating an open world of this size and scope is a difficult challenge, mainly because I am just an environment artist. Outsourcing will play a major factor in the creation of this game. The contributions you make to this campaign will allow me to hire all necessary resources including programmers, animators, and concept artists since I am currently working alone. Another Challenge will be the continuous server maintenance and upkeep, I am just a normal 9-6 working guy trying to make a fun multiplayer game for the masses. Which is why a small subscription fee of no more then $5 dollars may be introduced in the future.</p>
<p><b>Break Down of funds and how it will be spent</b>. </p>
<p>$5k -$10k - <b>Programmer</b> - full time programmer needed to create all the core game mechanics and functionality, as well as maintaining and updating code as needed through the development of the game.</p>
<p>$5k - <b>Concept Artist</b> - Environment concept art to establish mood, style and lighting, Character Concepts to visualize and define main character classes, and infected classes. As well as visualizing look to charactrer loot item such as backpacks, clothes, etc.</p>
<p>$5k - $15k - <b>Animator</b> - Creation of ALL custom game animation, main character classes and infected either through keyframe animation or Mocap. Mocap will cost much more as i would have to rent the space and hire actors to have this done.</p>
<p>$10k-20k - <b>Character Modeler</b> - The creation of all the in game models. We need 3 main classes with variations in case i add a character creation system, and 4 main infected class with a few variations to each of those as to not make them look to repeated in the game world. This is an expensive task to get done.</p>
<p>$5k - $10k - <b>Weapon Modeler </b>-<b> </b>The creation of all the in game weapon models, since i will not be licensing any of the actual weapon models, i will have clones created that look as similar as possible to the real thing. </p>
<p>$5k - $10k - <b>General Outsourcing</b> - While i will be creating most of the art in the game, some things that are more time consuming will be outsource to freelance artist. Objects like vehicles for instance can be outsourced, as these objects tend to take time to model and i would rather spend that time refining game play and working on environment art.</p>
<p>$2k - $5k - <b>UI - </b>creation of main game user interface, this can include loading screens, player HUD, and any additional player interface</p>
<p>$2k-$5k - Initial server setup and maintenance.</p>
<p>The rest will go to all the unforeseen factors that always comes up during the production process. </p>
<p>As you can see every contribution will help fund this project, and help pay for many of the services i need. Please help me make this game.</p>

The Infected will come in 4 classes.Infected - This is your standard infected carrier. Slow and highly contagious, they possess a heightened sense of hearing and sight. Strong biters and can quickly over come a survivor when encounter in large numbers.Giggler - Gigglers have reached the pinnacle of madness, the virus has completely stripped the person of all humanity. Extremely strong and fast on there feet. You know a Gigglers around by their eerie and indistinguishably Giggling, the moment a Giggler has sight of you, they will never stop chasing you until either you or it are dead. Gigglers tend to pounce and swarm there targets with a rapid succession of bites, scratches and blows to the body.Bloater - Bloaters are large husks of flesh that once was a person. Now they are filled with nothing but vile contiguous bile. The moment a Bloater has sight of you it begin to charge at you, and once it has you within its grasp it will start a chemical reaction within the Bloater that will ultimately end with it exploding and releasing all its contiguous bile upon anyone or anything around its area of effect. Its best to dispose of them quickly and at a distance.Roider - Roiders are a special breed of infected, they have managed to contract a rare mutated form of the virus that has altered there genetic makeup. They poses almost super human strength. Roiders are the most dangerous class, and will usually take more then 1 person to bring down. When Roiders are aware of your presence, they give off a terrifying shriek that alerts all other infected with a given radius, making your fight all that tougher.



I have worked as a professional 3D environment artist / game designer in the Video Game industry for the past 10+ years. I have worked on various AAA titles from pre-production to retail such as Legendary,Turning Point, Lost Planet 3, and, most recently, Call of Duty Advanced Warfare.


Art Station


               
Because of my past work experience, I have the skill and know how to develop a game from beginning to end. One of the reasons why ""What Remains"" will be an episodic game is because creating the game in sections or ""chapters"" is more manageable. Creating it like this will allow me to dedicate more attention to detail and fine tune every aspect of the game. 

As with any multiplayer online game, creating an open world of this size and scope is a difficult challenge, mainly because I am just an environment artist. Outsourcing will play a major factor in the creation of this game. The contributions you make to this campaign will allow me to hire all necessary resources including programmers, animators, and concept artists since I am currently working alone. Another Challenge will be the continuous server maintenance and upkeep, I am just a normal 9-6 working guy trying to make a fun multiplayer game for the masses. Which is why a small subscription fee of no more then $5 dollars may be introduced in the future.
Break Down of funds and how it will be spent. 
$5k -$10k - Programmer - full time programmer needed to create all the core game mechanics and functionality, as well as maintaining and updating code as needed through the development of the game.
$5k - Concept Artist - Environment concept art to establish mood, style and lighting, Character Concepts to visualize and define main character classes, and infected classes. As well as visualizing look to charactrer loot item such as backpacks, clothes, etc.
$5k - $15k - Animator - Creation of ALL custom game animation, main character classes and infected either through keyframe animation or Mocap. Mocap will cost much more as i would have to rent the space and hire actors to have this done.
$10k-20k - Character Modeler - The creation of all the in game models. We need 3 main classes with variations in case i add a character creation system, and 4 main infected class with a few variations to each of those as to not make them look to repeated in the game world. This is an expensive task to get done.
$5k - $10k - Weapon Modeler - The creation of all the in game weapon models, since i will not be licensing any of the actual weapon models, i will have clones created that look as similar as possible to the real thing. 
$5k - $10k - General Outsourcing - While i will be creating most of the art in the game, some things that are more time consuming will be outsource to freelance artist. Objects like vehicles for instance can be outsourced, as these objects tend to take time to model and i would rather spend that time refining game play and working on environment art.
$2k - $5k - UI - creation of main game user interface, this can include loading screens, player HUD, and any additional player interface
$2k-$5k - Initial server setup and maintenance.
The rest will go to all the unforeseen factors that always comes up during the production process. 
As you can see every contribution will help fund this project, and help pay for many of the services i need. Please help me make this game.
Thank you for your time.

A videogame to break away from typical Christian game tropes, and provide something family friendly that anyone can play and enjoy. Our game seeks to become a fun experience that is built upon the foundation of Biblical principle, creating a great outreach of Biblical values. Of course, many of you may be asking yourselves, “Why should I? This is not the only videogame to promote Christianity, and they are usually cheaply done. What would make your game any different?” Our answer: we have a plan for a completely new approach.</p><p>Although we do respect their honorable intentions, most Christian videogames try to make their videogames into a platform for preaching a sermon. But they’re missing the point. A videogame is supposed to be fun. When anyone sits down to play, whether it’s a videogame, board-game, athletic sport, or even simple make believe, why do they do it? To relax, to have some excitement, and to have fun. Anybody, even Christians, don’t seek out sermons to relax. If you have a videogame wagging its finger at you and telling you how to shape-up, you naturally don’t want to play it much or not at all. The message is wonderful, but the game itself isn’t, because the focus was too much on the sermon and not on the game. The Bible itself says, “There’s a time for any activity under the heavens.” There’s a time to be serious and learn, but there’s also a time to play and be joyful. Too much of either is not a good thing.</p><p>Should we ditch the whole idea of a ‘good’ Christian videogame then? No. Christian videogame does not automatically mean that it can’t be fun, and it shouldn’t mean, ‘for Christians only.’ We can present the gospel and be fun. How? Allow us to draw your attention to C.S. Lewis’ masterpiece The Chronicles of Narnia. It is a book series that displayed enduring Biblical principles and morals, yet is still enjoyed by the general public. How did C.S. Lewis manage it? Writing a fantasy that oozed with Christianity yet is still loved by all kinds of people, Christian and non-Christian alike? The key was subtlety. The Bible was the foundation for the world he built. It was the heart atop which layers of wondrous creatures and sites were placed. C.S. Lewis’ values weren't tacked onto Narnia. It peeked through Narnia. Just like the Bible says, “Out of the mouth, the heart speaks.” Whatever is within your core will leak into what you make.</p><p>We plan to make Soul Sword with the same tactic. The Bible will be the foundation, where the messages shall be unobtrusive yet profound. From it, we shall stem excitement, drama, and danger! By fun, we mean characters to relate to, engaging story, expansive gameplay, exciting battles, and a vibrant world to be explored. Because that is what a videogame is supposed to be . . . fun. Yet at the same-time, when you save your file to play another day, it will give you something meaningful to think about. Maybe something even life-changing. We want to reach out through fun.</p><p>With your contribution we’ll be able to:</p><p>	Put out good advertising </p><p>	Pay for resources, editing, graphic programs, and software.</p><p>	Give wages for professional services: music, writing, artists, and programmers.</p><p>	Create an official website. </p><p>	Pay for legal services for LLC and copyright.</p><p></p><p>So whether you believe in the saving power of Jesus Christ or not, we want to invite everyone to come, and just have a good time.

<p>HELLO INDIEGOGO! I'm Jamaco Brown,
co-founder of J Squared Innovations. As the name suggest, we create innovative
concepts encouraging day to day and professional efficiency and in the case of
BIZ N BALL, concepts that are extremely exciting, addictive, and fun. </p>
<p>The perfect way to describe BIZ N
BALL is the perfect combination of NBA meets an office space.  BIZ N
BALL characters are represented by the MILLIONS of us that make
up an office setting.  This includes the BOSS, who of course wants you to
always give maximum effort.  The BOSS definitely doesn’t want you playing
around so in BIZ N BALL if the BOSS catches you attempting to shoot an item in
the trash bin, YOUR’E FIRED, GAME OVER!  Then there is HEAD OF HR who
wants to ensure that all employees are treated fairly. Therefore, trying
the CO-WORKER TRICK SHOT will either provide you additional perks or get
you fired not only by the BOSS BUT HEAD OF HR. Now Besides you, the
GAMER(EMPLOYEE), being the most important character of the game, your CRUSH is
also important. In an office, there is always a CRUSH.  Whether it’s you
that has a crush on someone, or someone has a crush on you, THERE IS ALWAYS A
CRUSH IN THE OFFICE : ). Thus, in BIZ N BALL it is important to impress your
crush. Impressing your CRUSH gets you additional perks including the
ultimate perk, THE ALLEY-OOP!!</p>
<p>  Not only can gamers play BIZ
N BALL, but gamers can also compete with other players.  Compete with
random players (considered co-workers you don’t know) or with friends
(co-workers you do know).  Go head-to-head against each other by
playing HIRE OR FIRE or H.O.R.S.E.  </p>
<p> We need your help in providing
the world enjoyment and fun by contributing to the creation and
development of the BIZ N BALL Gaming application. This project has been 3
years in the making. As a winner of Applit's monthly competition in 2012 with
the app idea BODY GRAPH, I was enthusiastic about entering the next month's
Applits competition with Biz N Ball which was then branded as OFFICE BALL.
Unfortunately, OFFICE BALL didnt do as well as BODY GRAPH in the competition.
Although unsuccessful, the belief that the gaming application idea had
potential was always there. J Squared Innovations was founded February of 2014
in which one of our primary focuses is diversity: creating ideas that were not
only helpful but fun. The idea of OFFICE BALL was presented to my partner and
co-founder Joshua Taylor who loved the idea. After providing ingenious and
exciting additives to the idea, OFFICE BALL was rebranded and BIZ N BALL was
formed. We are extremely excited to present a gaming app idea that is exciting
and well thought out.  If you see the potential in the BIZ N BALL as we
do, be a part of the creation or simply tell someone of our Indiegogo campaign.</p>
<p>Hope you guys enjoy the idea
of the BIZ N BALL gaming application and thanks to everyone for your
support.</p>
</div> <div> </div><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><div>
</div><p>
</p><p>We are asking supporters for $27,
000 to create the BIZ N BALL Gaming Application.<span>  The funding will be used to hire an app
developing company.  The BIZ N BALL
project has been uploaded to ELANCE where we are filtering and making a final
decision on one of the 27 (and counting) potential companies from all around
the world to be the ideal company to partner with. In the event that we do not
reach our funding goal, the funding raised will go towards licensing
representation. We are also in contractual agreement with Enhance Product
Development who will showcase the BIZ N BALL project to potential
licensees.  As a result, we have created multiple
avenues to ensure that the BIZ N BALL game gets to the public.</span></p><p><span>
</span></p><p>To get a better understanding of what supporters get when selecting
a funding group, let us first explain the exciting BIZ N BALL PERKS.</p>
<p>BIZ N BALL PERKS:</p>
<p>Sound Proof Chance: THE SOUND PROOF CHANCES are to ensure
users that there will be no distractions when trying to shoot the item in the
trash can. However, run out of Sound Proof Chances and you should look out for
the BOSS.</p>
<p>THE EXCUSE: When THE EXCUSE is used, the BOSS forgives you
if he catches you in the act of playing BIZ N BALL.</p>
<p>THE BOSS INTERFERENCE: the coworker or crush will run
interference for you to hold the BOSS off from checking on you. In addition to
the INTERFERENCE OPTION, the time that the co-worker or crush has provided you
from running interference to make the shot will appear. Now that you know when
the boss is coming to check on you, you better make the shot(s) count.</p>
<p>THE HEAD OF HR INTERFERENCE: the coworker or crush will run
interference for you to hold HEAD OF HR off from checking on you. In addition
to the INTERFERENCE OPTION, the time that the co-worker or crush has provided
you from running interference to make the shot will appear. </p>
<p>ALLEY OOP ASSIST - <u>The ASSIST</u> IS GIVEN WHEN YOUR
CRUSH METER IS AT ITS HIGHEST LEVEL. 
This is perfect to use when you’re struggling to make a shot.  When using this option, your crush will rush
in to the office where you will alley-op the item to your crush who will gladly
dunk that item in the trash can for you.</p><p><br/></p><div> </div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><div> </div><p> We
understand that there will be challenges and hurdles to face in getting BIZ N
BALL from concept to a working game application. The funding amount that we are
asking for will ensure full development of the game.<span>  However, if we cannot reach the full amount,
those funds raised will go towards licensing representation as stated earlier
as well as developing as much of the game as possible.  The BIZ N BALL game will have 4 levels.
However, if creating the BIZ N BALL game with 2 levels, for instance, maximizes
our supporter’s funding, we are prepared to do just that. Then as the game
gains more popularity, we will then develop the game in its entirety. If you’re
willing to help us bring BIZ N BALL to life, we are more than willing to
develop it for your enjoyment.</span></p><div> </div><ul> </ul><div> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>We appreciate all contributions to this exciting
project.  Whether you’re helping in
funding BIZ N BALL or sharing the project with your family, friends, or
co-workers, we’re just happy that you are on board. We’ve created something that
is perfect for all ages and settings. So if you’re that 12 year old kid looking
for a new fun game to play or the professional in his/her office with a little
time to spare between meetings, this is the game for you. We want to provide
fun and excitement to the world and we want to do it through BIZ N BALL. <br/></p>
<p>Also, we would also like to thank Josh Woodward for allowing us to utilize his music for the BIZ N BALL Campaign video. Please support BIZ N BALL and those that have help bring this project to life.<br/></p>

<div>If you have played Dota for a long time, you might remember that it was not the only warcraft 3 map lying around during its heyday. Plenty of other, some times very fun, maps existed and were played. One of those was <a href=""http://www.dota-utilities.com/2011/06/dota-imba-377b-ai-en-download-dota-imba.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mimiya's Dota IMBA!</a>
</div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432071138/etxczyee0fba0apdqham.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>IMBA was a variation of Dota where <i>everything</i> was absolutely overpowered - so powerful, it was broken. And, as Mimiya brilliantly put it, the intent of the map was to have <i>""Imbalance in balance"" </i>- create a Dota game where all heroes are super powerful, and super fun to play, but the game is still playable and <i>enjoyable</i>, without any hero being truly impossible to play against.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This project consists in bringing IMBA to Dota 2 - using the Workshop's custom games system, currently in alpha, and soon to be released by Valve. We will not do a direct conversion of IMBA - rather, we'll use its ideas and spirit, and go on a new direction. Our purpose is to have you be able to play any of Dota's regular heroes, and <i>feel</i> like you're playing the same thing, but with new and exciting quirks on your old abilities.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Pudge will still throw hooks, and be a constant fear whenever he's missing, but no longer will he <i>only</i> do that. Night Stalker will still be a fat, rich creep during the day, but at night, he will be <i>fearsome</i>. Lina will still be a fragile nuker with incredible burst, but now she will devastate whole landscapes with her spells.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We will attempt to lovely craft <i>every </i>hero's skills in a way that makes them more interesting and brutal. Remember the feeling you had when you played Dota for the first time, and everything was new and unexpected and surprising - a whole new world? This is what we want to revive!</div>

<h3>Who are we?</h3>A brazilian beer-seller turned programmer - Felipe Calife</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>A netherlands teen studying hard to join the workforce - Hewdraw</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>A small community of modders who work together to help each other and bring their ideas to life - the <a href=""https://moddota.com/forums/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dota 2 modding community</a>.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We are the team that wants to bring IMBA to Dota 2. Myself (Felipe) and Hewdraw are amateur programmers, and as such, we needed all the help we could get from the more experienced modders to bring this project to fruition.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>They responded beautifully, answering our every question and doubt, providing a plethora of resources and tutorials, and holding our hand every step of the way. With all that help, we managed to get together <a href=""http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=440115357"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">IMBA's Workshop version</a>, which is now working, and available for anyone to play! Rocking over 12 thousand subscribers and a 92% positive user rating, we are very happy about its launch! :)</div>
<div><br/></div> <p>However, IMBA, at the moment, is not what we want it to be. It is merely a seed of something better - a seed which we need your help to make grow!</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>As project leader, I have been developing IMBA for Dota 2 for over six months. It went through various versions and evolutions, as I learned more about Dota modding - from <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/28yl72/a_fun_mod_to_play_with_friends_dota_imba/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">simple ability file editing</a>, increasing dota's regular skills' impact, to <a href=""https://breakingdota.wordpress.com/imba-6-83-5-new-abilities-revamped-items-breaking-the-mold/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">something a bit more complex</a>, to <a href=""http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=440115357"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">its current iteration</a>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>IMBA was always doable as a hobby, a side project - something I could use to relax while doing on the weekends. However, not anymore.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Implementing each IMBA hero is a somewhat lengthy process, taking anywhere from 4 to 10 hours (including all the testing and bug-fixing that has to be done). Implementing 2-3 heroes per week, plus new items, fixing newly-reported bugs, and writing news posts, patch notes, blog entries, takes me about 30 hours per week. I cannot reasonably work at that rate any more - I have to devote myself to a task which will allow me to have a roof to live in, and eat, after all :)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So, this is where the community comes in - if there is enough interest in IMBA after all, you can help me keep working on this at a decent rate!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>What do we get if we're funded? <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I will devote all the time necessary to keep pushing updates for IMBA at the promised rate:</span></p>

</ul>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I also promise to keep development going <i>at least until all dota heroes are in IMBA</i>. No compromises, we only stop when everyone is ported in.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>If we do not get funded, then I am sorry to say that I will have to go slow with this project, and keep it as a hobby - we might be able to push one hero per week consistently, but no promises beyond that :(</div>

<div><h3>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Stretch Goals</span><br/>
</h3></div>
</div><div> <p>I do not expect this project to go much beyond its initial funding goal; however, if it goes - we have a LOT of ideas for new game modes and extra things which could implement in IMBA - both things that Mimiya originally put in, and brand new ideas. We'll gauge the community's interest, and release the stretch goals if it seems feasible they might be reached. Stay tuned!</p>

   What We Need & What You Get As project leader, I have been developing IMBA for Dota 2 for over six months.

They burrow into their host planet all the way to the core creating the perfect conditions for reproduction. They evolve at a geometric rate, competing with and ultimately replacing all life on the planet in a bid for energy. 
GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW​Vanguard V is designed for play on VR headsets, and can be fully operated with head tracking alone. Qu, the main character, is controlled from the third-person and moves where you look in a hemisphere in front of the player. The core gameplay consists of dodging obstacles by moving your head, directing Qu’s course and directing the reticule that can lock onto any Parasites that it passes over, automatically shooting down enemies with Qu’s powerful energy weaponry. 
 
   QuQu is a Valkyrie Scout and has arrived at Earth finding the planet already in peril. Her homeworld was devastated when she was a young child by a Parasite invasion and it destroyed everything she held dear. Her home, her family; the parasites left nothing. She was only four years old and was whisked away as one of the few to survive the calamity.  It has been twenty years since Qu had her first encounter with the parasites and she now finds herself with a choice to flee from danger or save the planet below. 
    B.i.T.B.i.T. (Binocular interface Transmitter) is Qu’s robotic companion.  He is a non-biological but highly intelligent AI, and BiT knows much of humanity. A bit more cynical than Qu, BiT is thankful that humanity has lived in peace, as he feels he has little in common with them and would rather avoid contact if possible. He oversees Qu and is her best friend and companion. He also is a part of her arsenal; he functions as a remote camera, giving Qu a tactical overview of her own situation from 3rd person while also providing information on Qu’s surroundings. The ParasitesLittle is known about this threat to humanity. Initially thought to be a meteor on a near-collision course with Earth, it was classified as an unidentified space craft after it made intentional course corrections to impact Earth directly. The orb buried itself inside the planet, hatching to release a vast colony of creatures that consume organic matter and replicate rapidly. The Parasites evolve and change constantly; they have many specialized adaptations, including the ability to escape Earth’s gravity and fly through space! While seemingly unintelligent, they are highly reactive to situations and detect Qu as a threat even before she makes it to Earth.      By moving your head, BiT changes his orientation, following your movements one-to-one. Qu moves at an exaggerated rate based on your head movements, and smoothly and stylishly flies through the levels using her advanced cybersuit. The targeting reticle also moves independently of your view so you can easily and smoothly paint your targets. On some levels, movement of Qu is restrained/modified, both to aid in introducing the player to the controls, and to provide new and varied challenges. Hand Controls

 
The game will be released across all major platforms and the control scheme will be customized to fit with each hardware's available accessories to allow greater control.  You can also use the various hand controllers, be they Move controllers for the PSVR, the Move Controller for Oculus, or the Vive's hand controllers. Simply raise your hand in front of you and paint the targets with the targeting reticle. User InterfacePlayers view the action in Vanguard V from a third person perspective, though technically, the player is Qu, and is looking through her visor at the video feed from BiT who follows behind her. The interface consists of Qu, the player targeting reticle, and Qu’s personal shield status. Some events change the perspective including a first person sequence.     Level 1: Re-Entry
 Qu is flying in space with a heat shield as she re-enters the Earth’s atmosphere. With the heat shield active, Qu cannot operate her weapons at full capacity. Plow through the Parasites while dodging debris. Watch out because the Parasites can also shoot projectiles of their own. Keep that shield intact or you’ll burn up! - BiT Level 1: BossParasite cluster through the atmosphere and into the clouds. Qu’s weapons are offline due to the intense heat so she must dodge the shots. Fortunately, she is essentially a fireball and can plow right through individual parasites as the cluster begins to disintegrate. Entering the atmosphere hardcore now. Weapons are offline but hot damn, you're a fireball. Use it! Level 2: The Surface Qu enters the scene blasting through the sound barrier. Fly through valleys, Obsidian Falls and caves to reach the beach. Once at the ocean, Qu flies just above the water and remains parallel to the surface plane. This frees the player to look around at the attacking enemies. Qu’s laser arsenal is now fully operational in this stage, so she can fight back against the Parasites that are evolving rapidly. Level 2 Boss: The Leviathan The fight takes place on a large cylindrical path. We will be flying along the perimeter of the wormhole. Large rocks help us avoid getting hit from time to time, we look across the wormhole to find the titan flying in the same direction. We need to catch up. The leviathan breaks off some smaller enemies that fight with us on the way.As you reach the tail of the boss, you see vulnerable target areas. We don't want to give away any more spoilers for this boss! Level 3: The WormholeQu has now entered the giant tube left by the first impact of the enemy. Here Qu hugs the wall and you tilt your head to have her roll to the left or right. Burrowers will fly through the walls to attack. Use your Megabeam to fire straight forward and take out the threat. Dodge pillars, take out the enemies, avoid falling rocks! Level 3 Boss: The Tumbler This boss has long legs to maneuver rapidly through the wormhole. It curls its legs inwards to roll through at great speed. The tumbler will also go behind Qu and tumble through pillars. BiT will warn you of falling rocks. Watch the shadows for clues or turn around 180 in VR to see for yourself.  Level 4: The Lava CavesQu flies her way through the diamond hot lava caverns. With your heat shield re-activated, dodge lava flows and the elements of the Earth’s core. The stalactites will have parasites. The stalactites fall if you shoot them so time your shots carefully. BiT has short range radar of the caves. Listen to BiT’s directions to avoid danger. Keep that heat shield functioning! Level 4 Boss: Diamond Wyvern The level opens up to a wide liquid diamond lake that goes on for a large distance. There are stalactites that the wyvern flies below. Enemies are perched on the stalactites shooting at you. The wyvern is covered in diamond. It is nearly impossible to break. Players have different strategies they can use to be victorious this boss fight.  Level 5 Boss: The CoreQu has reached the center of the planet and it’s time for the final showdown with the alien invader. Qu flies around the boss from a fixed distance with full 360 degree control. Look which direction you would like to have her rotate and she will follow. There is a layer of rocks with openings along the wall of the final battle. Qu flies under this layer for protection but the core is more than capable of knocking out the cover. This creates more openings for Qu to shoot the core. Dodge the enemy shots, avoid falling debris shaken loose by the enemy, fire everything you’ve got!We don't want to give anymore spoilers out for level 6 or the final ending!   As much as we are lovers of games, we are also lovers of game MUSIC, new and old. We've assembled a team of considerable musical talent to produce a soundtrack that mixes the very best of new and old.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This project will eliminate your time investment in coding part of game development. You would require only baby steps of programing knowledge ..rest assured the IDE will help you in building games faster, eliminate the need for worrying about functions, API, typos and syntax error. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Since, I'm investing my time into into this project. Thus, I need some resources to support myself continue doing it dedicatedly for longer hours. Thus, your support will help me to do so. </p>
<p>The backers will get the full Visual Scripting IDE for all there favourite game engines with unlimited license.     </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Usually, the game development involves learning of several programming languages. The game engine can support exporting games to several platforms but what if someone can develop a single platform with which they can build games for different engine. Thus, with this ANKRAI Gamework's CodeWorks I intend to achieve the same.   </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Risk?? Since, I've already developed the project and completed the Phase I i.e, the development of visual scripting framework for GameGuru 3D Game Engine and distributing it to you guys at the start of the funding campaign itself. Therefore, I don't think my entrepreneurial story would end up as someone who took the money and run away. I've already provided the product from the start itself. Meanwhile I unlock the rest of the game engine you can have a go with its open beta at: <a href=""https://ank00.itch.io/codeworks"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://ank00.itch.io/codeworks</a></p>
<p>Challenges?</p>
<p>Apart from funds required to balance my part time job, doctoral study and my entrepreneurial ventures. I don't think there isn't a challenge associated with the project which i can't overcome. Though if you want more features to the Visual Scripting IDE, do contact me.   </p>

Short Summary
This project will eliminate your time investment in coding part of game development. You would require only baby steps of programing knowledge ..rest assured the IDE will help you in building games faster, eliminate the need for worrying about functions, API, typos and syntax error. 

What We Need & What You Get
Since, I'm investing my time into into this project. Thus, I need some resources to support myself continue doing it dedicatedly for longer hours. Thus, your support will help me to do so. 
The backers will get the full Visual Scripting IDE for all there favourite game engines with unlimited license.     

The Impact
Usually, the game development involves learning of several programming languages. The game engine can support exporting games to several platforms but what if someone can develop a single platform with which they can build games for different engine. Thus, with this ANKRAI Gamework's CodeWorks I intend to achieve the same.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">A Little About Me</h3>
<p>My name is <u>Mike</u>, and I have loved video games and computers since I was a kid. I spent much of my early teens modifying video games and consoles, as well as rebuilding consoles and computers. I taught myself much of my knowledge and continue to do so. I have enjoyed many games over the years, but my favorite games are the survival genre.  I am also a huge fan of old western movies, particularly John Wayne films - Some of my favorite memories are those of my grandfather and I watching John Wayne films together. <br/>I have waited for years for someone to create a game that includes both the survival genre and a great old western simulation, eventually I stopped waiting and started creating the game I've always wanted to play. Making this game is one of my dreams and I intent to bring it to life no matter what it takes. <strong>If you are interested in reading about the game please read below for details about the game.</strong></p>

<p><strong><u>The Town:</u></strong></p>
<p>There are stores to buy tools and sell supplies, a saloon to purchase some food and drink, a bank that you may conduct your financial business at, and a few other shops (NPC Vendors).

<p>All rocks and trees are able to be collected, these resources are needed for building houses, wagons, fences, and many other items.

<h2><strong>Why contribute?</strong></h2>
<p>I am currently in need of another developer and a few artists. I have come pretty far working solo on this project, but not everyone is perfect and mistakes happen which delay development.

<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Rewards?</strong></h2>
<p>All contributors will recieve some special in game items which will be account bound but NOT game breaking, for example if you get a special horse it will not be invincible and can die just like all other players, however it may be slightly faster have a different color and be able to hold more in the saddle bags, etc. Special contributor weapons will also have NO boosted damage but will have custom design and be more valuable as a collectors item. I DO NOT want this to become a pay to win so the perks will be set for mainly decorative limited edition in game items.</p>

<h2><strong>The Main Focus of LIH</strong></h2>
<p>Although many survival games are on the market, there are not many that are survival roleplaying games. The focus on this game is to merge the RPG aspect with the survival aspect incorporating both player-player interactions and player-NPC interactions. </p>

<h2><strong>What can go wrong?</strong></h2>
<p>I have been working on this project during quarantine constantly, although this Covid situation has put all of us in a rough place, the time at home also gives us time to pursue the things we want to do most. I will not be releasing this game with false information, there will be bugs and issues, however I will do my best to fix these bugs as they come up. Many games focus on releasing new content before they fix the broken content, which I have experienced in many games. It becomes quite frustrating seeing new DLC to get more money before fixing game breaking issues that currently exist. I will make the main focus on the core functionality of the game rather than constant DLC.</p>

Each island will have it own biome and weather. Player will also face many life threatening encountered like mutated plant and animal, extreme weather, wild animal, and deadly disease.   We know, we already have so many survival base game in our playlist, but of course, we do have our dream to create our own survival base game which is not only to push player to survive and loot for ammo/resources, we’ll also push player to organizing their belonging, every aspect in this game is matter.  The year is 2022, earth hit by terror of extinction, a new virus called D-VIRUS spread fast enough to trigger human extinction. To prevent human extinction, researchers from all over the world gathered to find solution, after a long discussion, they name their project as Doomsday Project. This project have purpose to save humanity by trained teenagers who have potential to survive by teach them basic survival in that matter. The scientist will also build a time-capsule for these survival candidate in hope they’ll have some time to let the virus goes down after a few years when they’re sleeping in the time-capsule.But, in 2023, this project leaked to public, causing panic in the world, people demand a mass production of this so called time-capsule. Due to the minimal amount of resources they have to build this time-capsule, the scientist decide to move this project to an island away from civilization.Will they survive? Will this teenager save the world? What’s exactly this virus is? Is this virus will bring death to our planet earth?  This game feature a basic element of Survival Game like Hunger, thirst, and health. We will also add disease and some new element to support the base mechanic of the game. This game will also provide you with farming and livestock management. Various islandsPlayers can explore various islands, ranging from islands with dense forests, tropical forests, snow islands, volcanic islands,desert island, etc., and not only that we will also present islands with forests that have been mutated due to virrus. for islands with mutated forests will be added when reaching the goal.The following is a picture of an existing biome. Craft, Build & Learn TableMAKE YOUR OWN HOUSE!

But be aware, some islands are not vehicles friendly because some islands have extreme conditions to be passed by vehicles. Several vehicles that can be made:- Unique vehicle (if goal is reached)- Buggy - Motorcycle- Small boat- Pickupif there is a lot of requests from the player we will add more Vehicle  AirShipAs for your concern, because this game will have many islands to explore we also provide you with a unique transportation, an airship to accompany you in your journey. This Airship will become as your second home or your flying home. You can add some survival tool for your airship like Aquarium, Planter, and many more. Don’t forget, you need to repair your airship if serious injury happen to her. Have a nice trip!​Airship can also be used as a ship if it runs out of fuel and store vehicles in the airship.  Story Mode ( Single Player / Online Co-op )Players will be taken to complete the mission, because they are chosen people of course their journey will not be easy.
