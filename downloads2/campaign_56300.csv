As a cosmetologist I know how important it  is for people to look and feel their best. However I believe our health is more important  than  our  vanity. Why potentially sacrifice your health for your beauty when your don't have too? Your skin is the largest organ of your body. Feed it only what it needs without the added junk that only a scientist would understand. Our products are fresh ,natural ,plant based & handcrafted.Making them safe for you and safe for the environment.

   Keeping our integrity and keeping up with demand We have been granted the opportunity to have our products distributed by the largest natural foods market in the country. The momentum is growing and we need your help to keep up with the demand.We will use the funds raised here to purchase our raw materials and packaging in larger quantities to keep the cost down .As well upgrade to commercial equipment while still maintaining the continuity and quality of our products. 
 Your contribution will not only make a difference now but also in the future. We are a company that is committed to sustainability as well as the local economy .

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Lifestyle choices</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>Longer telomeres (the protective caps of chromosomes which shorten over the course of a lifetime) are a sign of overall good health.

</div>
<div>
<b>We believe</b> that anyone who wants should be able to access data concerning their telomere length.<br/><ul>
</ul>That is why we have developed the first telomere testing kit which will be saliva based, direct-to-consumer, quick, and affordable. While development of our method is complete, we need <b>you </b>to make our efforts worthwhile.</div>
<div>Our team believes that <b>Big Data </b>in the area of telomere length will say a lot about the health of society, and even give insight as to what lifestyles are healthy on a cellular level and what aren't.</div>
<div>For example, long telomere length is strongly correlated to a Mediterranean diet. But there is still a lot to learn, and researchers need you to help get there.</div>
<div>Each Telomere Testing Kit will be delivered with a brief survey used to compare your telomere length with others who have taken our test. Thus, the more peole that take our test, the more valuable the data will be for researchers and participants.</div>

<h3>Our technology</h3>

<div>And yes, there are other saliva-based methods for measuring telomeres, but none have been developed which have been successfully launched on a commercial scale for at-home customers.</div>
<div>This is where our technology differs.

Order options are on the right side of the page, under 'Perks.'The CARRYGYM allows you to burn hundreds of calories from the comfort of your home. There are many workout devices on the market that monitor fitness, but without the physical effort of making it happen, you won’t get in shape.  Little effort produces little results.  CARRYGYM makes working out convenient with resistance bands at your fingertips in place of all the dumbbells, weight stacks, and machines.  You can work out with CARRYGYM inside, outside, in front of the TV or in the office. Carry it with you wherever you go! In addition to this, CARRYGYM is the perfect machine for personal trainers, fitness instructors and gym owners!           The CARRYGYM is even accessible by those in a wheelchair! Exercise shouldn't just be about who can go to the gym. We at CARRYGYM make it our goal to bring a healthy and fit lifestyle to anyone who wants it.A message from the CARRYGYM creator, Ed Wolan: During and after college, strength 
training became a part of my life.  It ultimately led me to the man who 
revolutionalized exercise machines, Arthur Jones, inventor of NAUTILUS 
equipment, and Dr. Ellington Darden, head of research at NAUTILUS.  These 
two gurus of the fitness industry changed my life. My friend, 
Gary Stempien, and I opened the first complete NAUTILUS facility in 
Michigan in the 1970s where we trained thousands of people, including 
professional athletes.All of this experience 
and knowledge is the prelude to this God-given inspiration to invent 
CARRYGYM.  Over the last couple of years of research and experiments, I am now ready to market CARRYGYM, a 12 lb. 
revolutionary fitness machine, to the public.  I can proudly and honesty
 say that CARRYGYM is truly a unique, great fitness machine.                         My goal of $7,500 will allow me to buy in bulk quantity and have CARRYGYM ready to ship to customers. We have plans to promote at trade shows and group classes such as karate clubs, churches, health clubs, organizations, or personal training sessions. Achieving these goals with your support is extremely valuable to expedite the invention of CARRYGYM to the public.  Having a sales track record will enable me to accomplish my dream of presenting the CARRYGYM on ABC's well-known show,  Shark Tank, thereby helping me to get an investor.When you support CARRYGYM, you are 
supporting fitness, health, and well being.  And through that support, you will help me to use CARRYGYM to motivate others to get fit. There are many exercises that you can do right in your home with CARRYGYM that are inspired directly from the gym - including incline chest flies, incline chest press, tricep extensions, forward deltoid raises, bicep curls, lower back extensions, upright rows, torso twists and many more. As the poster below shows you, these exercises can even be performed by those in a wheelchair using the CARRYGYM. By simply adjusting the CARRYGYM bands, you can easily change your workout from beginner to advanced. A passion for health, fitness, maximum performance and top-notch results is why the CARRYGYM is the new workout machine for you! The CARRYGYM truly is a big gym in a small package.TESTIMONIALS""I think CARRYGYM really works! I get as good a workout as I do when I go to the gym.""""CARRYGYM is a portable, versatile piece of equipment that is as good as, if not better, than a whole room full of equipment.""""I much prefer working out at home using the CARRYGYM with varying bands that I can adjust.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>Our Mission</u>: </strong></p>
<p>“Is to develop a great mobile application that end users will appreciate as being an invaluable asset in creating peace of mind for both Civilians and Law Enforcement alike”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>Who Are We</u>?</strong></p>
<p>We are a group of frustrated and highly motivated individuals who've decided to come together and work towards finding a solution to one of the most pressing issues in todays national conversation. The lack of understanding, miscommunication and avoidable conflict between Law Enforcement and our communities. We're not here to place blame on any one group or organization but rather to help foster a better dialogue between each other.</p>

<p><b><u>Our Founder: </u></b></p>
<p>My name is Devon Garrett and I'm a 31 year old African American man with a background in supervision &amp; management. I'm just trying to make the world a little better for my kids to live in. (Get a good laugh in about the mustache but know that this is an old picture when I had no choice but to shave my beard lol)</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>Our Thought Process</u>:</strong></p>
<ul><li>We think if people were to channel their anger and frustrations into something positive like our app we'll finally be able start focusing on a solution that might help reduce these traffic related incidents. Have you noticed that we all run to social media and cry and complain (including ourselves) whenever there's a civilian killed by a officer or an officer killed by a civilian? What if there was a way to reduce that problem? Would you help? Would you donate? Would you share? Or are you just so complacent with all the assaults and killings among both Law Enforcement and Civilians that it doesn't matter anymore? Once you've spoken your peace across all the social media platforms will you be fine with going back to your daily routine until the next BREAKING NEWS assault or killing grabs another headline?  </li></ul>

<h3>
<u>Our Plan, What we need &amp; What you get</u><strong>:</strong>
</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The money we raise will be use to do the following</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Design and Develop</li>
<li>Private testing and debugging</li>
<li>Beta Testing in select locations to prove viability</li>
<li>Debugging and resolving issues &amp; concerns that arise from Beta Testers</li>
<li>Market Direct Connect</li>
<li>Launch Direct Connect App to the public</li>
<li>Upgrading &amp; Supporting Direct Connect and its users</li>
<li>Give us the time and space to focus on achieving these goals</li>
</ul>

<u>The Impact</u><strong>:</strong>
</h3>
<ul><li>With just a little contribution from you we have the chance to start moving in the right direction and start creating a better dialogue between the people who are sworn to protect and serve us and the community in which they preform those duties. The majority of our citizens wake up, give their children a kiss before dropping them off at school and heading out for the day not expecting to be killed by an officer who jumps the gun during a 'routine traffic stop' which is already a nerve-racking situation. On the other hand the majority of officers wake up and kiss their kid(s) goodbye before heading into a job where they are never guaranteed to see their own family again because they could be preforming a ""routine traffic stop"" that may cost them their life. Our world is definitely imperfect and that's why we're asking you to help in improving it.</li></ul>

<h3><u>You have the opportunity to help create societal impact.</u></h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>1. As with any crowdfunding campaign there's a risk of not obtaining enough funding in order to successfully complete your projects goals due to unforeseen issues and changes. So to help alleviate some of that risk we are also looking for accredited investors who could help bridge the gap between the money that we've personally put into to our project and the money that we've raised from all of you generous people.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2. Law Enforcement Agencies will play a very important role in making Direct Connect a reality. They have to want to be associated with our service in order for this to come together properly and become an effective tool in creating that communication and understanding that we all hope to one day see come to fruition. We will strive to do our very best at showing them the benefits (both short term and long term) of having a tool like this become apart of their community outreach departments so we can start to improve the Community to Law Enforcement and vice versa relationship with each other.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
 
Our Mission: 
“Is to develop a great mobile application that end users will appreciate as being an invaluable asset in creating peace of mind for both Civilians and Law Enforcement alike”.
 
Who Are We?
We are a group of frustrated and highly motivated individuals who've decided to come together and work towards finding a solution to one of the most pressing issues in todays national conversation. The lack of understanding, miscommunication and avoidable conflict between Law Enforcement and our communities. We're not here to place blame on any one group or organization but rather to help foster a better dialogue between each other.

 
Our Founder: 
My name is Devon Garrett and I'm a 31 year old African American man with a background in supervision & management. I'm just trying to make the world a little better for my kids to live in. (Get a good laugh in about the mustache but know that this is an old picture when I had no choice but to shave my beard lol)

 
Our Thought Process:
We think if people were to channel their anger and frustrations into something positive like our app we'll finally be able start focusing on a solution that might help reduce these traffic related incidents. Have you noticed that we all run to social media and cry and complain (including ourselves) whenever there's a civilian killed by a officer or an officer killed by a civilian? What if there was a way to reduce that problem? Would you help? Would you donate? Would you share? Or are you just so complacent with all the assaults and killings among both Law Enforcement and Civilians that it doesn't matter anymore? Once you've spoken your peace across all the social media platforms will you be fine with going back to your daily routine until the next BREAKING NEWS assault or killing grabs another headline?  

 

 

Our Plan, What we need & What you get:

 
The money we raise will be use to do the following

Design and Develop
Private testing and debugging
Beta Testing in select locations to prove viability
Debugging and resolving issues & concerns that arise from Beta Testers
Market Direct Connect
Launch Direct Connect App to the public
Upgrading & Supporting Direct Connect and its users
Give us the time and space to focus on achieving these goals

So what happens if we don't raise the capital we need in order to develop our app? Well simply put all of the violence, protest, fights, innocent people being assaulted and or killed will continue. You'll log-in to your Facebook and see yet another incident has happened during a traffic stop where either a innocent civilian or cop has been shot dead. You'll voice your opinion while knowing that nothing will ever change. You'll turn on the TV and immediately see a red banner that reads BREAKING NEWS and then you'll watch a video of the incident as you shake your head and talk about it with your kids as everybody starts to take sides.
 
This will be the routine until maybe one day the person who's involved in the incident on the news is you or a loved one. We aren't saying that Direct Connect will completely and immediately solve the problem but we believe it's a start, that maybe it'll able to help reduce these types of events from occurring. Think of your donation more as an investment in your future safety or peace of mind and help us help you.

<p>15-year youth sports league officer Anne-Sophie Whitehead started the media community League Network to help her 300,000 fellow volunteers in North America's 41,000 leagues and 21 team sports make better leagues and better lives.  League Network's motto, ""Better Leagues Better Lives,"" comes from Anne-Sophie's discovery that no matter where you live, better youth sports leagues mean higher high school graduation rates and lower youth crime rates.  She learned how to slow embezzlement from youth leagues that has recently landed 1,100 coaches and trustees in jail, caused over 450 leagues to go bust and left nearly 100,000 kids without sports.  She unveiled the secrets of training and recruiting and raising funds and saving her league big bucks by buying smart.  And she built the world's largest database of youth leagues and their officers.  So along with her publisher husband Jay Whitehead and NFL veteran (Miami Dolphins, Dallas Cowboys, Carolina Panthers) and high school athletic director JR Tolver and digital marketer Erik Adamonis, she founded LeagueNetwork.com, League Network Magazine, and League Growth Assisted Fundraising to help league officers do 4 things to make better leagues and better lives: Learn best practices, Connect with other league officers, Save money by buying smarter, and Grow by raising funds.   League Network is a Public Benefit Corporation, which means we are legally required to track and report our social impact, which is defined as the amount of money we help leagues raise to support their kids.  </p>

<h3>The Better Leagues, Better Lives Campaign's Impact</h3>
<p>""Better Leagues, Better Lives"" is League Network's motto.  It came from Anne-Sophie and Jay Whitehead's experience that regardless of a community's socioeconomic status, its quality of life is higher if it has well-run youth sports leagues.  Anne-Sophie, Jay and NFL veteran JR Tolver are successful media and social entrepreneurs committed to social impact, and with many years' professional experience in media, sports leagues and marketing.  Leading companies such as Corporate Responsibility Magazine, the 100 Best Corporate Citizens List and Tickets-for-Charity, the League Network team has raised tens of $millions for good causes and helped the world's largest companies measure $billions in social and environmental impact, and improve their practices to do even better.  And remember, League Network PBC is a Public Benefit Corporation, which means we are legally required to track and report our social impact, which is defined as the amount of money we raise for youth sport leagues to support their players, officers and coaches.      </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We know how hard it is for league officers and coaches to do what they do as volunteers.  We also know how hard it is to launch a new media and fundraising company--between us, we've launched 15 companies, several of which have been quite successful.  We know how to make League Network work, because we've seen the upside and the downside of social entrepreneurship.  </p>
<p>One thing we know for sure--without the support of league managers and coaches like you, League Network cannot fulfill its commitment to better leagues and better lives.  So even if you don't support the Better Leagues Better Lives campaign, we'd love to hear from you.  Email AnneSophie@LeagueNetwork.com and tell us how we can improve.  And we'd love for you to share this campaign with your social networks, using Indiegogo's sharing tools right on the campaign page--share using your social networks--Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, etc.  </p>
<p>We know how to make this campaign successful.  Over the course of the 60-day Better Leagues Better Lives Campaign, you'll see us add video messages, add rewards for referrals, and add celebrity and league leader endorsements.  <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> </span></p>

My hope, as a yogi who started out on her yoga journey from a place of injury and pain, is that the art that I've created for these yoga mats inspires the new yogi to roll out their mat more often - especially on days that push back at you. I hope you are reminded to make more time for yourself, for the injured parts of yourself you've been neglecting, or to simply explore your magnificently colorful depths. I believe that art and yoga both teach us to make space for inspired breakthroughs, as well as quiet our minds so that we can hear the voice within us that may have gotten lost over time. Above all else, I hope to always honor the Light that guides us further in line with our most expansive, Highest Self.</p>
<p>&lt;3</p>
<p>My background:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since the time I learned how to hold a crayon, expressing myself creatively was a monumental part of how I defined myself. I spent much of my time as a performer, training classically in all the facets of dance and theater. Back at home in my childhood bedroom, I loved to sit for hours drawing and exploring the world of shapes and color. Over time, my drawing hobby became a valuable tool for emotional healing, meditation, empowerment and deeper soul expression. Shortly after college while working a job far outside the artistic sector, I sustained a dance injury, and with the intention of healing my body, I bought my first yoga mat. </p>
<p>For months, I rolled out my mat in my living room every day, and very quickly found myself in love with how incredible my mind and body felt even after only 15 minutes on my mat. As my body began to heal, my heart began to heal and flourish despite the old pain patterns, blockages, and negativity I'd internalized over the years. During this time, I started picking up my paintbrushes again every day, learning new techniques and letting go of any expectations. Power. Serenity. Love. Presence. All of these self-sustained, grown beneath my feet. I realized how far I had come from that creator I had once been as a child. Looking back on it now I know that I embarked on what is most likely the Renaissance of my life. I've come home to myself - through art, through yoga. One a particularly poignant day on my  mat in the summer of 2015, I made a promise to the child inside me, to share my experience and my art with others in a way that felt meaningful and true. </p>
<p>I love the idea that yoga can be experienced on a piece of art. Besides, there are far too many plain yoga mats out there! Come practice on a watercolor painting! How fun is that!?</p>

<p>CoRNerstone was founded after we recognized a huge need for healthcare support in the community. The increase seen across the board this year for corporate insurance plans was devastating. We saw that by combining our knowledge to create a corporate well-being program, we could help the most people in our community and create a win-win for the employees as well as the employers. We have to start working together as a community if we want to gain some control back over these skyrocketing healthcare costs. </p>
<p> Our mission is to become the ""cornerstone healthcare"" meaning that all roads will lead back to one entity that can track and coordinate a family or company's healthcare; we want to be the one constant that is always there to answer questions or assist with healthcare decisions and ties all of the many arms of your healthcare plan together. We want to create a family atmosphere and healthcare setting for our members that provide transparent pricing, an easy to use patient portal, and I know its crazy... but real live, experienced registered nurses driving the program. We believe that PREVENTION IS KEY... its importance comes right after employee engagement. If no ones utilizing the program, it really makes no difference how great the program or prevention strategies are. </p>

</h3><div>The Idea started from need, We had always been users of reusable Water bottles but always felt frustrated when cleaning the bottle, it would take so long and you would need a special brush and you could never tell if the bottle was clean or not. And then you had to let it dry or stick a ton of paper inside to dry it; there had to be a better way; and that's when the idea for the bottle appeared. After many months of brainstorming the concept was born. Then, as we started to dig deeper into the impact that using a reusable water bottle could have in the environment we knew we had something special.</div><div><br/></div><div><b>WHAT MAKES OUR BOTTLE UNIQUE</b></div><div>First its the World's first bottle to open in the middle. WHY? First it makes cleaning a breeze (check our video). Not just we were able to design and engineer a bottle that opens in the middle but the amazing part was that we were able to do that without making the bottle look bulky, the threads on the bottle are flushed with the body, so most people don't even notice that the bottle opens in the middle, also that makes LiKiDA bottles able to fit on standard bike bottle cages and cup holders. Plus LiKiDA bottles are super strong, believe us we have tested them endlessly, drops, run overs, bike rides, camping trips you name it we have done it. So be confident that we did our testing.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So LiKiDA was started solely by both of us (Nuno and
Monica), novices in this field, and never had started a business before. This
was beyond anything we had ventured, and it was scary and challenging, but we
had an Idea and a Dream so we knew we had to go for it!</p>
<p>Business expenses started piling in, first we designed and
got the Provisional patent and then the Non-provisional and then other business
costs, started to burn through a lot of money. We never took a penny from the business to pay ourselves. Then we decided to order the
first batch of bottles, maybe not the smartest move, and that’s when we ran
into trouble, money ran out and we were stuck with merchandise but no money to
continue operating the business. We were in deep debt, which meant that both of us had to
go back to our full-time jobs again, but we never gave up, and kept working on LiKiDA.</p>
<p>So we are here now, to ask you for your support to get the
business back up again. We have the bottles in stock, so be confident that you are not supporting a wanna be product, we have the bottles ready to ship to your home and ready to be used. We learned a lot, and made some novices  mistakes,
but we are ready now with your support to Kick start our Dream and to take it into the next
gear!</p>

</div></div>","LiKiDA Story
The Idea started from need, We had always been users of reusable Water bottles but always felt frustrated when cleaning the bottle, it would take so long and you would need a special brush and you could never tell if the bottle was clean or not. And then you had to let it dry or stick a ton of paper inside to dry it; there had to be a better way; and that's when the idea for the bottle appeared. After many months of brainstorming the concept was born. Then, as we started to dig deeper into the impact that using a reusable water bottle could have in the environment we knew we had something special.WHAT MAKES OUR BOTTLE UNIQUEFirst its the World's first bottle to open in the middle. WHY? First it makes cleaning a breeze (check our video). Not just we were able to design and engineer a bottle that opens in the middle but the amazing part was that we were able to do that without making the bottle look bulky, the threads on the bottle are flushed with the body, so most people don't even notice that the bottle opens in the middle, also that makes LiKiDA bottles able to fit on standard bike bottle cages and cup holders. Plus LiKiDA bottles are super strong, believe us we have tested them endlessly, drops, run overs, bike rides, camping trips you name it we have done it. So be confident that we did our testing.

  What We Need & What You Get
So LiKiDA was started solely by both of us (Nuno and
Monica), novices in this field, and never had started a business before. This
was beyond anything we had ventured, and it was scary and challenging, but we
had an Idea and a Dream so we knew we had to go for it!
Business expenses started piling in, first we designed and
got the Provisional patent and then the Non-provisional and then other business
costs, started to burn through a lot of money. We never took a penny from the business to pay ourselves. Then we decided to order the
first batch of bottles, maybe not the smartest move, and that’s when we ran
into trouble, money ran out and we were stuck with merchandise but no money to
continue operating the business. We were in deep debt, which meant that both of us had to
go back to our full-time jobs again, but we never gave up, and kept working on LiKiDA.
So we are here now, to ask you for your support to get the
business back up again. We have the bottles in stock, so be confident that you are not supporting a wanna be product, we have the bottles ready to ship to your home and ready to be used. We learned a lot, and made some novices  mistakes,
but we are ready now with your support to Kick start our Dream and to take it into the next
gear!
By supporting our campaign you will allow our dream: of building a meaningful company; to stay alive by providing us with the resources to continue to run the business and for us to continue to develop products that have positive impact in the environment and in the world.

<div><br/></div>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>EMG</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""></p>
<p>When muscles are activated, they produce electrical signal called EMG. Mpower uses a technology called surface EMG (sEMG) to measure and analyze muscle behavior during training.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>POD</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The Mpower pod is attached to the skin surface over any muscle to measure EMG-signal as the muscle responds to the training exercises. The Mpower pod transmits the measurement data to the Mpower app for further analysis.<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>APP</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""></p>
<p>Based on the data, the Mpower app calculates multiple parameters that help users get the most out of their training. </p>

</div></div>","FORGET THE GUESSWORK
MEASURE ANY MUSCLE AND IMPROVE
Mpower is a smart training solution that helps you build your strength whatever your goals may be. 





MPOWER TECH




HOW DOES MPOWER MEASURE MUSCLES? 

EMG

When muscles are activated, they produce electrical signal called EMG. Mpower uses a technology called surface EMG (sEMG) to measure and analyze muscle behavior during training.
POD
The Mpower pod is attached to the skin surface over any muscle to measure EMG-signal as the muscle responds to the training exercises. The Mpower pod transmits the measurement data to the Mpower app for further analysis.
APP

Based on the data, the Mpower app calculates multiple parameters that help users get the most out of their training. 


HOW
IT WORKS
1  
Measure any
muscle with a small pod, which you can easily attach to any single muscle
2
Get instant
feedback and learn to fine-tune your technique
3  
Find out if you
are using the right muscles and as efficiently as you could
4
Evaluate your
technique and strength over time to adjust your training plan 




BENEFITS OF MPOWER

are getting tired.





FOR PERSONAL TRAINERS AND COACHES 

If you’re a
personal trainer or a coach, Mpower is the perfect tool for ensuring better
results for you and your clients. 

FORGET THE GUESSWORK 
Have you ever
wondered if your training plan and workouts are the most efficient for your
client? Now you can create tailored strength training programs for each client individually. With Mpower, you can measure the effect of different techniques,
see how muscles are developing and make changes to the training plan as needed,
based on data, not on guesswork.

MOTIVATE YOUR CLIENT 
The old saying
“What you measure is what you get” applies also to strength training. When you
can show proof about the impact and progress of the training plan on your client,
you get a valuable motivation tool. 
•  Demonstrate the targeted impact of the
exercise by measuring activation power 
•  Show your client how their exercise
technique gets better by measuring activation power – the progress of training is
visible as increased muscle activation volume and max activation 
•  Show your client the impact of training
on endurance strength efficiency and speed strength

getting a great tool for your work, you will also see what a positive impact it
has on your professional image and gain additional profits. 
•  Improve the quality of your services as
a personal trainer

specialized offering and high quality service
•  Develop your service packages and get a
premium price by giving your clients measured proof of progress and that their
efforts are worthwhile

is the world's most accurate smart wristband that tracks and analyzes your
daily stress levels and sleep patterns. It helps you pursue life with less
stress and more mindfulness.With
sensmi, you can easily find out when, where, who, and what triggers the most
stress in life and work, and practice stress-relieving exercises to calm down and increase
focus, based on sensmi's suggestions.sensmi also accurately tracks and records lab quality sleep
data (light to deep) to evaluate changes in your sleep
patterns.







The Sensmi is the latest smart wristband to shift away from simply counting steps, and attempt to have more impact and meaning on our lives.  --  DIGITAL TRENDS
Figuring out what contributes to rising stress levels shouldn’t be that hard. Not when you can use a smart wearable such as Sensmi for the job.  --  gadgetify




By wearing his sensmi band, John can easily identify which aspects of his work day are giving him the most stress and promptly address them by practising breathing exercises. With the help of sensmi, John can even confirm instantly whether his stress relieving exercise was able to calm him down and increase his focus.


By analyzing her ""Sleep Zenpoints"" on her sensmi, Amanda will be able to track her sleeping patterns accurately and identify which of her daily activities help her maximize her sleep. Using sensmi, Amanda is given the insights she needs to change her daily habits and improve her well being.


By switching to the meditation mode on her sensmi, Abby is able to focus, find her peace of mind, and figure out if her meditation sessions have been useful in helping her find her zen. With sensmi, Abby is now able to track her progress on her path to mindfulness.






sensmi can identify and assess your destructive stress moments. Unlike the healthy activation, the destructive stress moment would follow by long period of high stress, in hours and even in days. Syncing with your calendar on smartphone, sensmi can pinpoint the event leading to destructive stress so that you can avoid such event in the future or exercise precaution in advance.



During deep sleep, people are in a total stress-free state. sensmi can detect this stress-free state and calculate the sleep cycle of deep and light sleep. sensmi can therefore evaluate the sleep quality based on the number of sleep cycle and the length of deep sleep you experienced.

sensmi is built with the proprietary GSR-Pro sensor to evaluate your stress level. It uses military standard encryption technology to protect your personal data. With large memory capacity and long battery life, you can wear it for a whole week without syncing or charging it.







*Galvanic Skin Response: Scientific research has shown that when we get excited, nervous or stressed, a burst of signals from the brain fire nerves on our skin that lead to a spontaneous fluctuation of skin conductance. GSR has more than 100 years history and has been widely used in biofeedback therapy in hospitals.
    



*A clinical trial was done to validate our GSR Pro technology with regards to stress identification and stress quantification using brain wave analysis as benchmark. Results show that our GSR Pro technology reached 100% accuracy in stress identification and 88.9% accuracy in stress quantification.

<p><i>A message from the founder of Fundathlon</i></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Ancient Olympia, 21/04/2016</span><br/></p>
<p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>The idea behind Fundathlon is the result of my experiences as a high-performance athlete (swimming and water polo), sports administrator, coach (volunteer), sports media professional, and digital marketer.</p>
<p>Having spent the first half of my life in Greece and the second half in Canada, personal challenges brought me back to my homeland - at a time of unprecedented socio-economic crisis not only in Greece but also in Europe and around the world. </p>
<p>Although there are no in-depth reports (national or global) as far as the impact of these socio-economic conditions on sport at all levels, there is no doubt that more than ever before, athletes (and their families), teams (amateur and professional) as well as sport organisations are faced with overwhelming financial challenges.</p>
<p>While I was going through some major changes in my personal life I couldn't help but absorb what was going on in the world and around me. Therefore, I decided to start a new business venture in the areas about which I'm most passionate: sport and the Internet. After much research, I found a gap in the area of sport fundraising via the Internet and that's how Fundathlon was founded.</p>
<p>Sport is a way of life, and ""athlon"" (<a href=""http://bit.ly/wiktionary-athlon"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://bit.ly/wiktionary-athlon"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ἆθλον</a>) does not only mean ""prize"" (after a victory) but also struggle and hard work (victorious or not). <i style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Fundathlon's mission is to help athletes, teams, and organisations achieve their goals in sport and beyond.</i></p>
<p>Today, in Ancient Olympia - the cradle of sport and <a href=""http://www.olympic.org/documents/reports/en/en_report_670.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Olympism</a> - as the sun's rays help ignite the torch, Fundathlon's crowdfunding campaign will be launched in order to finance this project.</p>
<p>I welcome you all to support us and be part of the Fundathlon journey!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h4>About the International Olympic Truce Center</h4>
<p>The International Olympic Truce Foundation and the International Olympic Truce Centre were established in July 2000 as a joint initiative of Greece and the International Olympic Committee (IOC), turning the commitment of the Olympic Movement to promote its peaceful principles into concrete action.</p>
<p>The initiative first took form in 1998, with a proposal from the Greek Government to the members of the IOC for the institutional revival of Olympic Truce in the new millennium. In a historic December 1999 decision, the International Olympic Committee announced the establishment of the International Olympic Truce Foundation and the International Olympic Truce, in cooperation with Greece.</p>

While striving for innovation in the areas of sport, digital marketing, sponsorship, and crowdfunding, Fundathlon will create winning strategies and synergies between athletes, teams, businesses, sports fans and consumers.


A message from the founder of Fundathlon
Ancient Olympia, 21/04/2016
Dear friends,
The idea behind Fundathlon is the result of my experiences as a high-performance athlete (swimming and water polo), sports administrator, coach (volunteer), sports media professional, and digital marketer.
Having spent the first half of my life in Greece and the second half in Canada, personal challenges brought me back to my homeland - at a time of unprecedented socio-economic crisis not only in Greece but also in Europe and around the world. 
Although there are no in-depth reports (national or global) as far as the impact of these socio-economic conditions on sport at all levels, there is no doubt that more than ever before, athletes (and their families), teams (amateur and professional) as well as sport organisations are faced with overwhelming financial challenges.
While I was going through some major changes in my personal life I couldn't help but absorb what was going on in the world and around me. Therefore, I decided to start a new business venture in the areas about which I'm most passionate: sport and the Internet. After much research, I found a gap in the area of sport fundraising via the Internet and that's how Fundathlon was founded.
Sport is a way of life, and ""athlon"" (ἆθλον) does not only mean ""prize"" (after a victory) but also struggle and hard work (victorious or not). Fundathlon's mission is to help athletes, teams, and organisations achieve their goals in sport and beyond.
Today, in Ancient Olympia - the cradle of sport and Olympism - as the sun's rays help ignite the torch, Fundathlon's crowdfunding campaign will be launched in order to finance this project.
I welcome you all to support us and be part of the Fundathlon journey!
Sincerely,
Makis Papadopoulos

About the International Olympic Truce Center
The International Olympic Truce Foundation and the International Olympic Truce Centre were established in July 2000 as a joint initiative of Greece and the International Olympic Committee (IOC), turning the commitment of the Olympic Movement to promote its peaceful principles into concrete action.
The initiative first took form in 1998, with a proposal from the Greek Government to the members of the IOC for the institutional revival of Olympic Truce in the new millennium. In a historic December 1999 decision, the International Olympic Committee announced the establishment of the International Olympic Truce Foundation and the International Olympic Truce, in cooperation with Greece.

</div></div>","(Weiter unten findest du die Beschreibung auf deutsch/scroll down for the German version)This is why we never have breakfast...





Where has the time gone? 
Every morning I am facing the same problem. I am short of time and also too lazy to prepare a healthy breakfast. Even having cereal takes too long. So I had to grab some junk food on my way to university or work.




 

We created a 100% organic mixture which replaces your breakfast in a delicious, healthy and quick way.
Striving for a wholesome breakfast, we created a 100% organic mixture containing filling carbs, proteins, healthy fats and plenty of fiber. Furthermore we mix it with 125ml (4 fl oz) of a customary smoothie which adds secondary plant substances, vitamins and replenish the glycogen store. We top it off with cow's milk in order to stabilize blood sugar and provide essential minerals like calcium.





Special about our approach:


You will be satisfied for at least 4 hours. 

Our shake contains only 300kcal/calories. 

Our shake is prepared within 60 seconds.




Easy to handle!







   
It is delicious - WE PROMISE!









But what if you do not like coconut flakes or are allergic to nuts? 



No problem at all. We are building a web shop that..


allows for customization 





provides more than 50 different ingredients
enables you to create your own flavor


With the help of your money we will set up the web shop even faster. If you share our vision please support our campaign.  





This is what you have to know about our mixture:


100% organic ingredients: it consists of several finely and freshly ground nuts, porridge oats, coconut flakes, wheat bran, flaxseed and other super foods


Perfect recipe: the proportion is ideal for mixing a shake as well as baking muffins (just add baking powder & one egg)                                                                   => comes with even more ideas on new recipes

Frequently Asked Questions - FAQ

  If you have any further questions please do not hesitate contacting us via info@breakfastbird.com

 Is this approach not way too expensive?  
A healthy breakfastbird shake is charged with only roughly 2.5$ per shake - all together (smoothie, organic mixture and milk). In comparison to an average sandwich on the way which costs 3$ each, our offer is really attractive for you. Keep in mind that the advantage of a healthy and 100% organic breakfast with its' positive long-term impact is not even considered in the previous calculation. What is the money for?
The money helps us achieving the following two objectives:

Set up a web shop: we want to build a web shop that allows you to create your individual mixture - you decide on the ingredients                                


Spread the word: our vision ist to feed all early birds across the globe


Is it really healthy? Evidence! 
Yes, of course! We analyzed over 100 healthy breakfast foods and read over 50 papers. That allows for deducing the most important ingredients and finally come up with breakfastbird.You want to know more about it? Click here.
How many calories does it contain?

A really beneficial and light breakfast. Once you have tried, you know what we mean by light breakfast. There are three reasons why you should use breakfastbird:




300kcal is the maximum (35g organic mixture|125ml customary smoothie| cow's milk containing 3.5% fat )


No cravings: if you 
start your day with a breakfastbird shake, you won't be hungry for the next few hours 


Cut the calories to 200kcal: by diluting with water or using less of our organic mixture




Just enjoy!







Jeder dritte Deutsche geht ohne Frühstück, aber mit knurrendem Magen, aus dem Haus. Um sich anschließend beim Bäcker um die Ecke mit einem belegten Brötchen einzudecken.
Wir haben eine Super Mischung (100% BIO) entwickelt, die dein Frühstück auf eine gesunde, schnelle und leckere Weise ersetzt.

Breakfast bird strebt danach ein vollwertiges Frühstück zu liefern. Deshalb kreierten wir eine Mischung, welche...
langsam verdauliche, langkettige Kohlenhydrate  
sättigende Proteine
gesunde, ungesättigte Fette
& viele Ballaststoffe 
enthält. Das Ganze mixen wir mit 125ml Smoothie (die Hälfte eines handelsüblichen Smoothie)  und vervollständigen das Frühstück dadurch mit wichtigen sekundären Pflanzenstoffen, Vitaminen und schnellen Kohlenhydrate, die den über die Nacht entleerten Glykogen-Speicher wieder füllen. Abegrundent durch die gleiche Menge an Kuhmlich (alternativ: Sojamilch) stabilisieren wir den Blutzuckerspiegel und beugen dadurch Heißhungerattacken vor. Zudem versorgen wir den Körper mit essentiellen Mineralstoffen wie z.B. Kalzium, welches den Fettaufbau hemmt, die Speicherung verhindert und die Fettverbrennung anregt.

Das besondere daran ist:


Du bist die nächsten 4 Stunden gesättigt.


Ein Shake hat gerade einmal 300 kcal.


Das Ganze ist in 60 Sekunden präpariert.


Das solltest du über die Super Mischung wissen:


100% biologische Zutaten: Die Mischung besteht aus fein gemahlenen Nüssen, Haferflocken, Kokosraspeln, Weizenkleie, Leinsamen und anderen Super Foods.



Was ist wenn du Kokos nicht magst oder allergisch auf Walnuss reagierst?





Überhaupt kein Problem. Wir bauen gerade einen Webshop, der es dir ermöglicht...

deine Mischung zu individualisieren 








mit einer Auswahl aus über 50 unterschiedliche Zutaten
um schlussendlich deinen eigenen Geschmack zu kreieren

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The Crystal Chamber is in its earliest stage of production. Technology that is included in chambers is in stage of patent pending. We estimate that we need</p>
<p> $150 000 for buying machinery for production. If we do not reach the funding goal we will still use raised money for the investment in our production and make sure all the backers receive their perks.  Perks that we chose for you are mostly parts included in Crystal Chamber, so you can experience the positive influence on your health in privacy of your home. The most exciting perks are T shirts, and hats embedded with crystal bead that is actually inside of the main product - Crystal Chamber. In that way you will have a direct positive influence of active crystals on your body. Also, another exciting perk are specially made active crystal boards that can be installed in your bedroom, living room or anywhere else you wish in your house or office and in that way neutralize bad energy in the room giving  healthier air and emotion. </p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>

Technology is there, we have all the knowledge needed  for this project to be successful. We will use all our experience to make and at the end to sell this product to the mass. In last couple of years we already had two successful  and new projects that were our innovation. For example, Dalma Cab that produces Mediterranean climatic effects was a huge success in Croatia. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We accept all kinds of help. So please, spread the word about this great product so we can make this world better together! </p>
</div></div>","We are innovative and passionate in everything we set out to achieve, to constantly exceed expectations through the most efficient and high value-added solution.

Combining sensors, micro controllers, communications technology and smart materials we created new devices that enhance personal self-care and give new approach to self healing.

SMART +
INTERACTIVE + SENSORY




Their main functions are: stress reduction, purification, ionization, oxidation, energetic balancing, acupressure, and positive programming.
It purifies, energizes, ionize and balance your bio-physical condition !




Technologies to automatically recognize stress are extremely
important to prevent chronic psychological stress and pathophysiological risks
associated with it. There is  great
variability in how people experience stress and how they express it
physiologically.



Putting your feet on the floor of crystal panel, energy contact will be set up between person and chamber becoming ""alive"" and begins to clean the body and mind.





Chamber uses Electrodermal Activity (EDA) as a
physiological indicator of stress and strong emotion. Device in Crystal chamber
detects skin conductance responses, which are spikes in the signal indicating a
""fight or flight"" response.




 Crystal Chamber collects EDA dates,
analyzing them to obtain reliable estimates of stress and emotion . Users can
visualize these results and download files containing features calculated on
the data to be used in their own analysis. 


After level of stress and type of excitment is
detected,Chamber launches fully
automated system that intelligently responds to a person's affective state in
real time.



Smart
device choose the right colors combination of different
shades for any specific state. It launches circular polarization of light through crystals
and the movement of cleansing the energy blocks, comprehensive emotional states
leading to imbalances and a deep form of natural healing to cleanse these imbalances.

Light is
responsible for turning on the brain and the body. Light enters the body
through the eyes and skin. When even a single photon of light enters the eye,
it lights up the entire brain. This light triggers the hypothalamus, which
regulates all life-sustaining bodily functions, the autonomic nervous system,
endocrine system, and the pituitary (the body's master gland).





During a session time Smart device tests the reactions of the entire
organism in the real-time monitoring how we see colors and how they can have
impact on our human health.
This technique can assess frustration, stress,
and mood on the individual and direct way reacting on emotionally intelligent,
especially responding to a person's frustration in a way that reduces negative
feelings.




All the results can be seen and downloaded in
Crystal Chamber application made for smart phone. Application will also be
available on the web site and the Cloud.




By learning to identify what is stressful, as well as what works to
reduce stress, individuals can take the steps necessary to help them live
healthier, longer lives.


During the 25min session you are exposed to the active influence of crystal chamber that purifies, energizes, ionize and balance your bio-physical condition.You can see the changes of your transformation during the session. You can see your before and after results on your smart phone.




WHAT IS CRYSTAL CHAMBER - CHAMBER THAT CHANGES THE WORLD OF SELF-HEALING!

Crystal chamber is a 4-side
opened box, dimension 47.25“ x 47.25“ x 66.93“ height
(120 cm x 120 cm x170
cm).It can be placed in any corner of the house ,office,sport center or spa and
wellness centers and club houses. 




Chamber is interactive and react with person`s stress level while sitting inside changing colors in the chamber`s panel.






Chamber has more functions. Every side of chamber has its own function. It neutralizes a high concentration of CO2 and generates bio-active, life-enhancing energy fields that can simply and easily produce significant health benefits, physically, mentally and emotionally.

Stressful electromagnetic field is completely
neutralized by the Crystal chamber in the time you are sitting and creating an
effect what scientists call a ‘zero-point field’. 

Chamber monitors climatic CO2, humidity and temperature. 

Highlights
Crystal chamber generates bio-active, life-enhancing energy fields that can
simply and easily produce significant health benefits, physically, mentally and
emotionally. Exposure to these fields has been found to:

Detoxify the air and the room; 
Detoxify the body and the mind
Recharge cells 
     
Enhance the functioning of the immune system
Boost cell regeneration
Elevate mood
Assist in balancing the brain
Increase energy levels an oxygen level


It’s taking the contaminating
     energy from the surroundings and changing it into beneficial energy
     patterns.






We  placed a
chair inside of the chamber so  person can
sit exposed to positive energy effects generated by physical and biophysical
influences that produce a lot of health 
benefits. 

 Our work in progress…..

Part of the chamber system monitoring is
climatic control of the air in the room.
 With the high CO2 concentration and non- proper ventilation, people will feel headaches, dull, drowsiness, lose of concentration and correspond to the high levels of dust, chemicals and bacteria in the air.
Monitor
detects air condition in the room.


 
Children are the most vulnerable group.







 Chamber changes color depending on the stress
level.

</div>
<div>The LEDula will take a common 2-handed (and at times – awkward) procedure down to a single handed procedure; freeing up the second hand, and more importantly <b>time</b>, for the medical professionals of the world. </div>
<div>When a Wooden Tongue Depressor is used (with one hand), and a light is illuminated (with a magnification light - in the other hand) from ""outside"" the Patient's mouth, the Medical Professional has to battle the shadows; cast from the Lips, Teeth, and Tongue.</div>

<div>The LEDula has an Ergonomic/Automatic Pressure Switch, that is designed to turn on and Illuminate the Entire Oral Cavity, Throat, and Tonsils - from Inside the Patient's mouth - when the user presses down to reposition the Patient's tongue. </div>
<div></div>
<p>However, these things
are not even the most important aspects of the LEDula… it’s SAFER! In
recent years there was a Contaminated Wooden Tongue Depressor batch that was
linked to being Contaminated with Rhizopus Microsporus – causing Gastric
Mucormycosis! The LEDula's Disposable Probe Covers ensure that there will never
be any type of contamination. We go to the Doctor to get better... not worse!</p>

</div><div></div><p>A Lot of thought,
time, effort, and money has already been invested into the Engineering of the
LEDula. That's why we are ready to enter the Prototype Phase! However, this
will not be the typical ""Trial and Error"" effort, which is typical of
the Prototype Phase. We have already virtually tested many designs, sizes, and
practical applications of the LEDula and have perfected the Engineering,
Manufacturing, and Logistics. This leads us into a very structured Prototype
and Product Testing Model.</p>
<p>With all of that being
said - in the last year, we have developed fantastic relationships and pricing.
We will be able to Manufacture the LEDula Prototype, Product Test (and any
additional R&amp;D, if needed), and do a 1st Run (i.e. of 100 Units and 18k
Probe Covers) for far less than most spend on their Prototype, alone.</p>
<p>Hasn't it already been
too long (getting rid of the Wooden Tongue Depressor)? Here's what we need to
make it happen:</p>
<p><b>Total Goal =
$60,000.00</b></p>
<p>*The 1st Phase is
$15,000.00. Here's what that $$$ will go towards:</p>
<p>- Prototype
Manufacture</p>
<p>- Product Testing
(Includes any needed R&amp;D, Engineering, Design Changes, and Re-run of
Prototype)</p>
<p>- Logistics for
Prototype - Travel, Lodging, Food, Expense. We will need to attend the
Manufacturing of the Prototype; for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>*The additional
$45,000.00 will cover the following:</p>
<p>- P/T and Corporate
Attorney</p>
<p>- Incorporation for
LEDula</p>
<p>- Insurance - GL,
Product Liability, E&amp;O, Etc...</p>
<p>- 1st
""Limited"" Run of 100 Units - LEDula's</p>
<p>- 1st ""Limited
Run of 18,000 Probe Covers</p>
<p>- Marketing and
Branding</p>
<p>- 4 Medical Seminars
and Conferences; Fees, Travel, Food, Lodging, Etc...*</p>
<p>*We will need to
attend Medical Seminars and Conferences to get Endorsements! We give a Medical
Professional a Free LEDula, and enough Probe Covers to get them through 1 week
of use, and they give us a Written Endorsement, LOI (i.e. to use the LEDula, in
the future), and needed Feedback.</p>
<p>We already have half a
dozen Medical Professionals that are Extremely Excited to use the LEDula. These
Endorsements and LOI's will go a long way, when it comes time to line-up the
LEDula for a Limited, 3 State, Initial Run and Release.</p>
<p>The Crowd Funding Goal
for the LEDula was carefully computed and is truly ""bare bones"". With
that being said - there was not a lot of room for ""Incentives"". So, a
lot of thought went into how we could truly reward you, the Contributor.</p>
<p>Yes, when you give $$$
to help get the LEDula up and running (so to speak) - you are helping to make a
Medical Procedure ""<b><i>SAFER</i></b>"" and are doing your part to
Help The Environment. However, we really did not want the LEDula Campaign to be
""Charity"" Based. So, I asked myself a question that ""Walt
Disney"" would commonly ask, ""how do we Plus it?""</p>
<p>We now have Rewards
from $10 to $1,000.00 - and most of them are Environment Based. When you give your
Support to the LEDula Campaign (i.e. $50 and up) - you are not only helping
save the Millions of Trees that would be Cut-down and Processed, to make the
(no longer needed) Wooden Tongue Depressor... you are adding Trees to this
Magnificent World we live on; and the Trees are planted in your Honoree's Name!</p>
<p>So, from a Single Tree
to a Large Grove of Trees, and Honorable Mentions to an actual LEDula from our
1<sup>st</sup> Run, we have come up with an Incredible Rewards Program.</p>
<p>Even if we could just
get $1.00 from everyone - that $1.00 is going to help Change The World! </p><p></p><p><b>                                                           The Impact</b></p><div>

<br/><p>The LEDula will take a common 2-handed (and at times –
awkward) procedure down to a single handed procedure; freeing up the second

the medical professionals of the world. However, these things are not even the
most important aspects of the LEDula… it’s SAFER!</p>
<p>For years, or since the
“shift” into what is considered “modern medicine”, there is one medical
instrument that has stayed the same – the Wooden Tongue Depressor. Why? Sure,
it is perceived to be inexpensive and easy to produce. I ask - what about the
high cost to the White Birch Tree? Also, is the Wooden Tongue Depressor the Safest,
Most Efficient, and Best Instrument for the job? I am about to show you why it
is not. </p>
<p>Imagine yourself at a Doctor’s appointment. You have
been suffering from a severe sore throat, headache, and chills. After your
nurse has taken your vitals and recorded your symptoms – you spend your time
reading the literature on the walls, playing “crossy roads”, and checking out
all the stuff in the exam room. One thing you always see – a jar full of Wooden
Tongue Depressors.</p>
<p>Your Doctor (or PA) walks in, asks you how you have
been, advances the conversation with some small talk, and dives into your
symptoms (so to speak). When you mention that you have been suffering with a
sore throat (that feels like it is as dry as the “Sahara Desert”), the Doctor/PA
stops what he or she is doing and heads over to where the Wooden Tongue
Depressor Jar is taking up precious countertop space. After grabbing a Tongue
Depressor, he or she then walks over and grabs the Magnification Light off of
the wall… tells you to open up and say, “Ahhhhh” (i.e. with one hand holding
the Wooden Tongue Depressor and the other holding the Magnification Light)… and
<i>awkwardly </i>tries to get your mouth
open and tongue into a position – where they can properly illuminate the oral
cavity, throat, and tonsils (even though it is hard to light the oral cavity,
properly, from outside of the patient’s mouth).</p>
<p><b><i>Now,
rewind…</i></b></p>
<p>In this scenario – everything starts the exact same.
However, this time (after telling the Doc/Pa about your “Sahara Desert” throat)
the Doctor/PA reaches in his or her pocket, pulls out a LEDula (which is the
exact same length and width of a standard Wooden Tongue Depressor), presses the
LEDula down into a box of Probe Covers (e.g. like they use on the Digital
Thermometers), and tells you to open your mouth and say, “Ahhhh”. This time the
procedure is done with one hand. As soon as they use the LEDula to put pressure
on the tongue (i.e. pressing the tongue down and out of the way) – the LED
system lights up… illuminating the entire oral cavity, throat, and tonsils.
This time – the oral cavity is completely illuminated from inside the patient’s
(i.e. your) mouth… no shadows from lips, teeth, or tongue; which has a habit of
getting in the way and casting a shadow into the bottom/back of the throat.</p>
<p>Once your Doctor has finished the oral part of the exam
– they aim the LEDula at the opening of the bio-hazard disposal bin, press on
the back of the LEDula’s Disposable Probe Cover, shooting it into the bio-hazard
disposal bin, and clips the LEDula back in their lab coat pocket. No muss… no
fuss.</p>
<p>Now – Imagine being a part of putting a LEDula in the
hand of each and every medical professional in the world! No more jars of
Wooden Tongue Depressors. Isn’t it about time to withdraw this antiquated
device (if you want to call a piece of wood a “device”) from “Modern Medicine”?
Envision the MILLIONS of trees that will be saved when the archaic Wooden
Tongue Depressors are replaced with the contemporary and efficient LEDula. </p>
<p>Yes, we may want to keep a
few boxes of wooden depressors available for “Arts and Crafts” projects, for
school children; but they no longer belong in the modern medical realm.</p>

<br/>
<p>Helping to save one of our
most important natural resources, taking a Two-handed proceduredown to a One-handed procedure and
increasing the effectiveness of a medical procedure are not the only things
that the LEDula will do and/or save. TIME, is another one of the essentials
that the LEDula will help save.</p>
<p>10-12 seconds per exam does not really sound like a
lot. However, it adds up. 10 minutes per day could equal an extra exam; while
100hrs a year would allow Medical Professionals to help a lot of additional
patients. We all know how over worked our Medical Professionals are… 100hrs
would sure make for a nice vacation… giving these Medical Professionals a much
needed rest.</p>
<p>Imagine how much more efficient it would be – having a LEDula
in the hand of each and every Medical Professional and Volunteer in the USA; or,

</div></div>","Short Summary
Can you believe, in today's world of ""Modern Medicine"", that Medical Professionals still use a Wooden Tongue Depressor and separate Magnification Light (from the outside of the Oral Cavity) to do an Oral Exam? A ""piece of wood"" is still considered a Medical Instrument?! Imagine the Millions of Trees that have been used to make these Wooden Tongue Depressors.


     
                    With Your Help, we can Evolve past the Scenes Above.
                     Contribute Today, for a World of Better Tomorrows!      
I have Patented a New Medical Device that is going to help Save these Trees; by replacing the Wooden Tongue Depressor with a Safer, more Efficient, and more Effective Device - the ""LEDula"" (Patent Pending).






The LEDula will take a common 2-handed (and at times – awkward) procedure down to a single handed procedure; freeing up the second hand, and more importantly time, for the medical professionals of the world. 
When a Wooden Tongue Depressor is used (with one hand), and a light is illuminated (with a magnification light - in the other hand) from ""outside"" the Patient's mouth, the Medical Professional has to battle the shadows; cast from the Lips, Teeth, and Tongue.

                                    
The LEDula has an Ergonomic/Automatic Pressure Switch, that is designed to turn on and Illuminate the Entire Oral Cavity, Throat, and Tonsils - from Inside the Patient's mouth - when the user presses down to reposition the Patient's tongue. 

However, these things
are not even the most important aspects of the LEDula… it’s SAFER! In
recent years there was a Contaminated Wooden Tongue Depressor batch that was
linked to being Contaminated with Rhizopus Microsporus – causing Gastric
Mucormycosis! The LEDula's Disposable Probe Covers ensure that there will never
be any type of contamination. We go to the Doctor to get better... not worse!
With your Donation -
you will not only be helping Revolutionize a very Antiquated Device and
Procedure, and making Oral Exams much Safer for Everyone... you will also be
doing your part to help Save Millions of Trees!

                             

                                 Let's all do our part to keep this from happening!!

                          *This used to be a BEAUTIFUL Forest... now, it is gone*


                          Please continue reading and make your Donation, Today!

                      What We Need & What You Get


 *Version 2.0 of the LEDula will have a RF Temperature Sensor (Located on the Bottom - See Design) & LCD Screen (i.e. Schematic Above), to take and give the Temperature of the Patient. When the LEDula presses down on the Tongue, and the Light is Automatically Activated, the Patient's Temperature will also be Taken and Displayed on the LCD Screen.**However, this Version will be after the LEDula 1.0 has been through a Full Cycle and World Wide Release**

*The LEDula Version 1.0, the Version that will be Launched 1st, does not include the Temperature Probe, nor the LCD Screen. Version 1.0 will only have the Ergonomic/Automatic Pressure Switch and LED Lens Set... which will Illuminate the Entire Oral Cavity*

A Lot of thought,
time, effort, and money has already been invested into the Engineering of the
LEDula. That's why we are ready to enter the Prototype Phase! However, this
will not be the typical ""Trial and Error"" effort, which is typical of
the Prototype Phase. We have already virtually tested many designs, sizes, and
practical applications of the LEDula and have perfected the Engineering,
Manufacturing, and Logistics. This leads us into a very structured Prototype
and Product Testing Model.
With all of that being
said - in the last year, we have developed fantastic relationships and pricing.
We will be able to Manufacture the LEDula Prototype, Product Test (and any
additional R&D, if needed), and do a 1st Run (i.e. of 100 Units and 18k
Probe Covers) for far less than most spend on their Prototype, alone.
Hasn't it already been
too long (getting rid of the Wooden Tongue Depressor)? Here's what we need to
make it happen:
Total Goal =
$60,000.00
*The 1st Phase is
$15,000.00. Here's what that $$$ will go towards:
- Prototype
Manufacture
- Product Testing
(Includes any needed R&D, Engineering, Design Changes, and Re-run of
Prototype)
- Logistics for
Prototype - Travel, Lodging, Food, Expense. We will need to attend the
Manufacturing of the Prototype; for obvious reasons.
*The additional
$45,000.00 will cover the following:
- P/T and Corporate
Attorney
- Incorporation for
LEDula
- Insurance - GL,
Product Liability, E&O, Etc...
- 1st
""Limited"" Run of 100 Units - LEDula's
- 1st ""Limited
Run of 18,000 Probe Covers
- Marketing and
Branding
- 4 Medical Seminars
and Conferences; Fees, Travel, Food, Lodging, Etc...*
*We will need to
attend Medical Seminars and Conferences to get Endorsements! We give a Medical
Professional a Free LEDula, and enough Probe Covers to get them through 1 week
of use, and they give us a Written Endorsement, LOI (i.e. to use the LEDula, in
the future), and needed Feedback.
We already have half a
dozen Medical Professionals that are Extremely Excited to use the LEDula. These
Endorsements and LOI's will go a long way, when it comes time to line-up the
LEDula for a Limited, 3 State, Initial Run and Release.
The Crowd Funding Goal
for the LEDula was carefully computed and is truly ""bare bones"". With
that being said - there was not a lot of room for ""Incentives"". So, a
lot of thought went into how we could truly reward you, the Contributor.
Yes, when you give $$$
to help get the LEDula up and running (so to speak) - you are helping to make a
Medical Procedure ""SAFER"" and are doing your part to
Help The Environment. However, we really did not want the LEDula Campaign to be
""Charity"" Based. So, I asked myself a question that ""Walt
Disney"" would commonly ask, ""how do we Plus it?""
We now have Rewards
from $10 to $1,000.00 - and most of them are Environment Based. When you give your
Support to the LEDula Campaign (i.e. $50 and up) - you are not only helping
save the Millions of Trees that would be Cut-down and Processed, to make the
(no longer needed) Wooden Tongue Depressor... you are adding Trees to this
Magnificent World we live on; and the Trees are planted in your Honoree's Name!
So, from a Single Tree
to a Large Grove of Trees, and Honorable Mentions to an actual LEDula from our
1st Run, we have come up with an Incredible Rewards Program.
Even if we could just
get $1.00 from everyone - that $1.00 is going to help Change The World!                                                            The Impact



The LEDula will take a common 2-handed (and at times –
awkward) procedure down to a single handed procedure; freeing up the second
hand, and more importantly time, for
the medical professionals of the world. However, these things are not even the
most important aspects of the LEDula… it’s SAFER!
For years, or since the
“shift” into what is considered “modern medicine”, there is one medical
instrument that has stayed the same – the Wooden Tongue Depressor. Why? Sure,
it is perceived to be inexpensive and easy to produce. I ask - what about the
high cost to the White Birch Tree? Also, is the Wooden Tongue Depressor the Safest,
Most Efficient, and Best Instrument for the job? I am about to show you why it
is not. 
Imagine yourself at a Doctor’s appointment. You have
been suffering from a severe sore throat, headache, and chills. After your
nurse has taken your vitals and recorded your symptoms – you spend your time
reading the literature on the walls, playing “crossy roads”, and checking out
all the stuff in the exam room. One thing you always see – a jar full of Wooden
Tongue Depressors.
Your Doctor (or PA) walks in, asks you how you have
been, advances the conversation with some small talk, and dives into your
symptoms (so to speak). When you mention that you have been suffering with a
sore throat (that feels like it is as dry as the “Sahara Desert”), the Doctor/PA
stops what he or she is doing and heads over to where the Wooden Tongue
Depressor Jar is taking up precious countertop space. After grabbing a Tongue
Depressor, he or she then walks over and grabs the Magnification Light off of
the wall… tells you to open up and say, “Ahhhhh” (i.e. with one hand holding
the Wooden Tongue Depressor and the other holding the Magnification Light)… and
awkwardly tries to get your mouth
open and tongue into a position – where they can properly illuminate the oral
cavity, throat, and tonsils (even though it is hard to light the oral cavity,
properly, from outside of the patient’s mouth).
Now,
rewind…
In this scenario – everything starts the exact same.
However, this time (after telling the Doc/Pa about your “Sahara Desert” throat)
the Doctor/PA reaches in his or her pocket, pulls out a LEDula (which is the
exact same length and width of a standard Wooden Tongue Depressor), presses the
LEDula down into a box of Probe Covers (e.g. like they use on the Digital
Thermometers), and tells you to open your mouth and say, “Ahhhh”. This time the
procedure is done with one hand. As soon as they use the LEDula to put pressure
on the tongue (i.e. pressing the tongue down and out of the way) – the LED
system lights up… illuminating the entire oral cavity, throat, and tonsils.
This time – the oral cavity is completely illuminated from inside the patient’s
(i.e. your) mouth… no shadows from lips, teeth, or tongue; which has a habit of
getting in the way and casting a shadow into the bottom/back of the throat.
Once your Doctor has finished the oral part of the exam
– they aim the LEDula at the opening of the bio-hazard disposal bin, press on
the back of the LEDula’s Disposable Probe Cover, shooting it into the bio-hazard
disposal bin, and clips the LEDula back in their lab coat pocket. No muss… no
fuss.
Now – Imagine being a part of putting a LEDula in the
hand of each and every medical professional in the world! No more jars of
Wooden Tongue Depressors. Isn’t it about time to withdraw this antiquated
device (if you want to call a piece of wood a “device”) from “Modern Medicine”?
Envision the MILLIONS of trees that will be saved when the archaic Wooden
Tongue Depressors are replaced with the contemporary and efficient LEDula. 
Yes, we may want to keep a
few boxes of wooden depressors available for “Arts and Crafts” projects, for
school children; but they no longer belong in the modern medical realm.

<p><strong>My Story</strong></p>
<p>I am an Austrian based Stand Up Paddler and started with this watersport in summer 2011. With a focus on racing, exploring and SUP center business but limited due to long cold winter time and freezing cold water. Looking for proper sup clothes became an issue to protect me from the elements to keep me warm, safe and comfortable.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460070169/Wolfgang_im_Inn_640x383_gbfk31.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Every sport has its specialized equipment and clothes but all I could find was wetsuits or heavy bulky 4 layer thick drysuits for kayaking which didn´t work well for standing on a board. So either I was sweating and still freezing in my wetsuit or limited by movement and soaked in an expensive baggy drysuit. </p>
<p>Also my sup rentals and clinics went down to 0 after the last warm sunny days in fall and only would pick up again in late spring. 6 months of low business would be tough on any sup based business around the world.</p>
<p>So I figured that if SUP would keep growing strong as it does, the need for a best solution custom tailor made technical drysuit would be enormous. Since stand up paddling is called the fastest growing sport in the world it´s worth to give it a go.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460320612/Wolfgang_St._Moritz_to_Venice_2014_639x869_fgppsn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>We started from scratch and a first hand sewn and glued proto suit. We didn't want to follow a given path and redesigned the concept of a drysuit combined with a not watersport based membrane fabric which has never been used for drysuits before. It led us into a new dimension of technical clothes. It´s a bit like how Apple did change the game for mobile phones  whilst others did miss the evolution. </p>
<p>After only 3 years of testing, learning and some more testing we have established a true brand with a quite big fan base around the world. Supskin became an institution in the cold watersports activities and not only in stand up paddling but due to its high end quality and outstanding function also in other sports like sailing, jetskiing, ocean canoeing and even ice climbing and cross country skiing.</p>
<p>The main focus lies on tailor made suits, boardshorts that don´t get wet and useful accessories as drysocks and drypants. Everybody is different in bodysize, activities and style. To follow these needs we created an unmatched product line and customer service that no other brand is able to offer.</p>
<p>As a family operated business with a focus on an environmental friendly recyclable product made in Europe we have reached a limit of what is possible.</p>

<h3>How does the HOVERSPIN™ work?</h3>

The HOVERSPIN™ is a fully metal high-tech spinning top. It featurs an advanced design including; adjustable top and base for easy leveling.

Spin the top - and make it hover!  
It spins while surfing on magnetic waves! You can even hold your hand underneath the top and it will continue to spin and float in mid air!  The HOVERSPIN™ is supported only by magnetic force, produced by magnets in the top and base (no batteries required).


""It's not magic! It's physics. The speed of the turn is what keeps you upright. It's like a spinning top."" Deborah Bull

The HOVERSPIN™ is a beautiful top which will last for generations to come. It's made for those with a playful mind who have a nack for engineering, physics or science. It sports a minimalist timless design for those who love elegance and simplycity. A great gift for a friend, co-worker or yourself.
HOVERSPIN™ is the first metal spinning top that levitates
 The HOVERSPIN™ is designed and manufactured in Switzerland. Crafted from aluminum, each piece is precision machined on state of the art CNC lathes producing perfectly balanced components. Once machined, each piece is meticulously instpected for dimensions and weight. They are then and only then hand finished in our workshop in Switzerland. 



 ""Once you have tasted flight you will walk the earth with your eyes turned skywards, for there you have been and there you will long to return."" Leonardo da Vinci

The Challenge



The HOVERSPIN™ is not just a simple toy, it requiers some skill. Beginners will need some practice to spin the top. As your skills increase so will your flight time. 
The HOVERSPIN™ was created by a division of Additive Dynamics to demonstrate the fascinating display of magnetic force.
A scientific theorem was formed over a century ago that states it's impossible - yet this amazing top levitates right before your eyes!

If you would like to make the HOVERSPIN™ availabale for everyone, please support us and select one of the perks below.  We are offering reduced pricing for our first backers.

FAQ


What holds the top up?

The combination of centripetal force and magnetic waves

Why does it need to spin?
To jumpstart the magnetic forces
Why does the top slip sideways?
Because the magnetic base is not adjusted so that it is completly level.
Why is the weight critical?
Barometric pressue and temperatur can influence the power of the magnets. This is why the top is adjustable.


How does the HOVERSPIN™ work?
We receive numerous queries from HOVERSPIN™ owners asking for an explanation of how it works.  Many express surprise that it works at all, often citing a theorem by Earnshaw (1,2) as proof that it should not work.  Interest in the HOVERSPIN™ has always run high among scientists.  Recently, analogies of the HOVERSPIN™ to traps for microscopic particles (e.g., electrons, neutrons) have been recognized by scientists working in a fascinating area of research where matter is manipulated and examined, one such microscopic particle at a time.  The first to recognize the analogy was Dr. Michael V.

2 Red Wines Supporting Prostate Cancer Research

Why We Are Here:Pursuing a long-time love of wine, I (Winemaker Bob) started small volume wine making in 2007.  The goal was to produce the explosive style of Zinfandel and Syrah-based Rhone-style blend I find most exciting.  The award-winning Zinpiphany© Zinfandel and Rhone-styled #2red were the result.  Passion later changed to purpose following a diagnosis of incurable prostate cancer. Determined to make the best of the situation, I created the Robert and Susan Hollander Foundation, an IRS approved 501c3 non-profit supporting prostate cancer research.  Since then, all proceeds from my wine making efforts at 2redWinery are committed to supporting prostate cancer research through the Foundation.  Your tax-deductible support will allow me to continue to produce great wines for you while supporting prostate cancer research.



The Campaign:
By helping me make my next two barrels of wine with your tax-deductible support, you can secure wines from the 2016 vintage or from my award-winning wine library while supporting prostate cancer research.

The campaign has three parts:


Your tax-deductible support.
Red wine rewards for you.
All proceeds pass to the Foundation and prostate cancer research.


About 3 million men are living in America right now with prostate cancer and about 28000 will die this year.   Prostate cancer will affect about 1 in 7 men over their lifetime.  This campaign will allow me to continue the pursuit of something I love while helping someone you may know.






What I Need, What You Get & What I Do
All proceeds above my anticipated wine makings costs of $16,200 for the two barrels are committed to the Foundation and prostate cancer research.  The Foundation currently operates with an expense rate of 0.0% (I pay the costs.)  You get the wine (see Perks).  I get the satisfaction of making wine and doing something useful.  In the three fiscal years the Foundation has been operational, we have made annual gifts with recipients including clinical investigators at MD Anderson and the Cleveland Clinic.  Both wines have been consistent award winners:I am proud and pleased with all of my wines, including those not yet entered in competition.  The 2012 Zinpiphany and #2red are the current go-tos on our dinner table.  




The Perks

Like wine futures,  you can secure wine from the upcoming 2016 vintage.  I will be offering single bottles, mixed two-packs, wine 6-packs and full cases of Zinpiphany and #2red.   For those of you with immediate gratification needs, you can select from my existing wine library, including some of the wines listed above.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>Hey there!</p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""> Glad to have you reviewing our campaign. My name is Cody, President of Aftermath Supplements Inc., my passion for fitness developed at a young age, I remember I was in grade seven, over for dinner at my friends place. His dad had a men's fitness magazine, I opened it and started to read. (Well, started looking at pictures of fit girls. That counts as reading, right. lol) I remember seeing this massive dude on one of the pages and it clicked, I said to myself, ""some day, I'm going to be big like that."" In grade seven, I got my first weight bench, by grade eight I was working out with 165 lb on flat bench at four sets of eight reps. It was love at first rep... I enjoyed the exhausted feeling after an intense two hour lift session and still do. I enjoy growing as a person, and fitness is so easily relatable to life. We don't grow unless we experience pain, it takes heart break to know what ""love"" actually is, and it takes the pain of that last rep to tear your muscle apart. But, in the aftermath, we become stronger, and better. </span><br/></p><p>The only thing I didn't enjoy, was the slow recovery time, and getting fatigued earlier then I wanted. SO, I started experimenting with different supplements, researching, looking into the science behind the claims, if there were any and used myself as a guinea pig. As the years go by, you waste a lot of money learning what works and what doesn't. BUT! Wasting money or not, the experience and knowledge you gain are invaluable. A lot of products out there have the bare minimum of what's needed to get the job done properly, and I'm tired of it. </p><p>When it comes to spending my hard earned money on products, I want the best, not some hocus pocus, magic powder. I want results, and I want it backed by science. <br/></p><p>With the knowledge I've gained over the years and a lot of extra research I stepped up to design my own product line. Enter, Aftermath Supplements Inc., this supplement line has been intentionally designed with maximum dose for maximum benefit to the user. I sourced one of the best contract manufacture's in America with the best flavouring capability. They source and test the highest quality ingredients for use in our products, with a four week turn around from product order to fulfilment. That's pretty damn good. </p><p>It's our mission at Aftermath Supplements, to bring you high quality products, designed for results at the lowest possible price. We're here to help you conquer. Our second mission is to stay true to fitness and clear of sex sells marketing. We don't agree with objectifying people as merely sexual objects put here for our pleasure and fun. You're a human-being. You're invaluable. </p><p>We have six products to start with, over the next two years we will be introducing a natural testosterone booster that actually works. It's our goal to triple the high end of normal testosterone levels and it will be backed by science. We will also be introducing a plant based enzymatically alive nutritional drink. </p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I've always been entrepreneurial at heart, partly because I have other big dreams besides fitness to impact this world in a positive way. There's a lot of non-sense going on in our own countries that seriously has no need.

<p>What are you waiting for!? Doo it. ;)</p></span></div></div>","Hey there! Glad to have you reviewing our campaign. My name is Cody, President of Aftermath Supplements Inc., my passion for fitness developed at a young age, I remember I was in grade seven, over for dinner at my friends place. His dad had a men's fitness magazine, I opened it and started to read. (Well, started looking at pictures of fit girls. That counts as reading, right. lol) I remember seeing this massive dude on one of the pages and it clicked, I said to myself, ""some day, I'm going to be big like that."" In grade seven, I got my first weight bench, by grade eight I was working out with 165 lb on flat bench at four sets of eight reps. It was love at first rep... I enjoyed the exhausted feeling after an intense two hour lift session and still do. I enjoy growing as a person, and fitness is so easily relatable to life. We don't grow unless we experience pain, it takes heart break to know what ""love"" actually is, and it takes the pain of that last rep to tear your muscle apart. But, in the aftermath, we become stronger, and better. The only thing I didn't enjoy, was the slow recovery time, and getting fatigued earlier then I wanted. SO, I started experimenting with different supplements, researching, looking into the science behind the claims, if there were any and used myself as a guinea pig. As the years go by, you waste a lot of money learning what works and what doesn't. BUT! Wasting money or not, the experience and knowledge you gain are invaluable. A lot of products out there have the bare minimum of what's needed to get the job done properly, and I'm tired of it. When it comes to spending my hard earned money on products, I want the best, not some hocus pocus, magic powder. I want results, and I want it backed by science. With the knowledge I've gained over the years and a lot of extra research I stepped up to design my own product line. Enter, Aftermath Supplements Inc., this supplement line has been intentionally designed with maximum dose for maximum benefit to the user. I sourced one of the best contract manufacture's in America with the best flavouring capability. They source and test the highest quality ingredients for use in our products, with a four week turn around from product order to fulfilment. That's pretty damn good. It's our mission at Aftermath Supplements, to bring you high quality products, designed for results at the lowest possible price. We're here to help you conquer. Our second mission is to stay true to fitness and clear of sex sells marketing. We don't agree with objectifying people as merely sexual objects put here for our pleasure and fun. You're a human-being. You're invaluable. We have six products to start with, over the next two years we will be introducing a natural testosterone booster that actually works. It's our goal to triple the high end of normal testosterone levels and it will be backed by science. We will also be introducing a plant based enzymatically alive nutritional drink. I've always been entrepreneurial at heart, partly because I have other big dreams besides fitness to impact this world in a positive way. There's a lot of non-sense going on in our own countries that seriously has no need. We have enough resources, technology, talent and skill to solve most of our hunger and homeless related issues; if we put our hearts, minds and pockets together. Aftermath, will be initiating possible solutions to these issues and investing in them over the years to come. ALL of your contributions matter, from the smallest to the biggest, everything adds up and I want you to know that every penny invested in our start-up, is greatly appreciated. Let's make this dream come to life! Will you do this with us?Thank you!You can check out our product design and look at, www.aftermathsupplements.comWhat We Need & What You GetWe need $175 000 to start this properly. $122 610 to start manufacturing our product line and $52 390 for marketing through social media, internet, and fitness magazines. Besides our current discounts, every investor will receive a %30 discount on all purchases for 12 months!! Investing with us will be a great choice, as I have already explained we're passionate about fitness, real results and playing an active significant role in researching and developing solutions to help eliminate hunger and lift up poverty stricken families in our city and our country. Life is short gift and we only live it once; we may as well do all we can to make a positive difference in the world around us. Your ImpactAs we grow, we will be utilizing a blog section on our webpage to ask our customers what issues they would like to see us contribute to, so we can donate to a different cause every other month. YOU, YES YOU. ALL of your contributions will make this dream and much more come to life! Money isn't meant to be hoarded, or squandered. Together we can make a difference!! Wait, there's more, if we reach our minimum goal, $5 from every purchase will be donated to help support the families of the Fort McMurray wild fire. Risks & Challenges

Matheau's background is in advertising, marketing, web design and broadcasting. Regina has a background in fitness, holding past certifications through the American Council on Exercise and Stott Pilates. She is a certified as a 200 Hour Yoga Instructor through YogaWorks.<br/>
<ul> </ul>
<p>From personal experience, I remember being interested in yoga and all its benefits, but not wanting to add anything to my life that would hinder my faith in Jesus Christ. 
</p>
<p>After much prayer, research and practice, I noticed that rather then hindering my faith journey, my yoga practice actually helped me become more honest with myself and how I really was responding to conflict and everyday stress. <b>My time on my mat was helping me see how I responding off my mat.</b>
</p>
<p>There is a quote that says, <i>“Jesus can expound nothing until we can get through all the noisy questions of the head, and are alone with Him.""</i>
</p>
<p>Those words encompass what begun to happen in my life. 
</p>
<p>Yoga is learning to live in the moment by connecting each breath to each movement. The practice of yoga is not some sort of spiritual magic.  When we learn to be more aware of our God-given bodies - emotionally, spiritually, physically—yoga serves as a tool that can also help us become more aware of our habits, thought patterns and how we respond when conflict comes. 
</p>
<p>So, our family has embarked on the journey of creating ONE+ONE Yoga. We offer more then just online yoga classes, we have a continually growing library of articles and blog posts to help you understand yoga terminology, and even how parts of the yogi philosophy may or may not line up with our with the Christian faith. We will be adding new video content every month and quarterly challenges to help you live with intention - on and off your yoga mats.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is currently overhauling rules for sunscreen manufacturers in the U.S. Common sunscreen chemicals such as oxybenzone and octinoxate are readily absorbed into the bloodstream. These chemicals cause hormone disruption, reduce sperm count in men, and incite reproductive health issues in women. These chemicals are also destroying the coral reefs.</p>
<p>Right now, only two sunscreen ingredients are generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE). These are titanium dioxide and zinc oxide. Zinc oxide is a mineral-based UVA and UVB reflectant that forms a barrier between your skin and the sun's radiation. Zinc oxide is the active ingredient in our original Live Pure Sun Care Creme formula. We are leading the way for sunscreen manufacturers in terms of safety and effectiveness, however...</p>
<p>The FDA's rules require that we put our product through costly broad spectrum clinical SPF testing to ensure that the sunscreen works as intended. We need your help in getting our sunscreen the appropriate clinical testing. Additionally, we must move our production to an FDA-approved, organic certified facility and work with chemists to calibrate our formula for mass production. The good news is: there is a manufacturing facility in the Sunshine State that meets our standards for purity.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Hi there, we are Lance and Kender Johnson, founders of Live Pure Body Care. For seven years, we have manufactured our very own skin care products and served tens of thousands of these products to the world. These products are unique because they were a vital part of how we recovered our health and how we continue to protect our cells from endocrine disrupting chemicals. These products are NOT made from synthetics whatsoever - no parabens, heavy metals, coal-tar, or hormone-disrupting chemicals.

<h3>Partner with us and change the world for the better</h3>
<p>Live Pure Body Care has three main objectives going into 2020 and beyond, and we are asking for your partnership to make these objectives a reality:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>  We want to ramp up production for our original Sun Care Creme formula in an interested FDA-compliant, organic certified facility in Miami, Florida. Our Sun Care Creme not only protects against excessive UVA and UVB rays that may lead to skin cancer, but also protects you from the <a href=""https://www.ewg.org/sunscreen/report/the-trouble-with-sunscreen-chemicals/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hormone-disrupting, cancer causing chemicals</a> that are currently used in top sunscreen brands in the U.S! To do this, we must work with chemists to calibrate our formula for large batch runs.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>  By scaling up the production and marketing of our Sunscreen, we will be on the forefront of protecting oceanic habitats and the health of coral reefs. Our formula does not contain the chemicals that destroy beautiful oceanic creatures and their natural habitats. Studies now show that the mass production of <a href=""https://www.naturalnews.com/2018-05-07-hawaii-bans-sunscreen-chemicals-that-destroy-coral-reefs.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">sunscreen chemicals is killing the coral reefs</a>. The hormone-disrupting chemicals found in most body care products are even <a href=""https://www.naturalnews.com/2019-07-11-extinction-killer-whales-toxic-chemicals-have-made-the-females-sterile.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">affecting the reproductive abilities of orca whales</a>. For these reasons many sunscreen chemicals, such as oxybenzone and octinoxate, are being banned in places like Hawaii, and the FDA is starting to promote formulas that contain zinc oxide, one of the top ingredients in our formula!</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong>  We must achieve clinical broad spectrum SPF testing so we can market our Sun Care Creme as ""sunscreen"" and be competitive in the marketplace. By increasing our sales, we will be able to donate more of our profit so we can work with humanitarian missions. One of our long term goals is to provide clean water to communities that do not have access to this precious resource. People who do not have access to clean water are truly suffering, and we want to do our part in making the world a better place.</p>
<p>Because of these priorities, Live Pure Body Care must move our base of operations out of Illinois so we can mass produce our sunscreen in an FDA-approved, organic certified facility in Florida. To do this, we ask for your help in raising $15,000.</p>
<p>This is an incredible time to grow, to impact the sunscreen market in a positive way. We look to continue shipping our products to the contiguous 48 United States and hope to expand our products worldwide as the opportunity arises.</p>
<p>For now we are asking for your help in achieving our base goals of successful broad spectrum SPF testing, and calibration of our formula at an FDA-compliant, organic-certified facility.</p>

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is currently overhauling rules for sunscreen manufacturers in the U.S. Common sunscreen chemicals such as oxybenzone and octinoxate are readily absorbed into the bloodstream. These chemicals cause hormone disruption, reduce sperm count in men, and incite reproductive health issues in women. These chemicals are also destroying the coral reefs.
Right now, only two sunscreen ingredients are generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE). These are titanium dioxide and zinc oxide. Zinc oxide is a mineral-based UVA and UVB reflectant that forms a barrier between your skin and the sun's radiation. Zinc oxide is the active ingredient in our original Live Pure Sun Care Creme formula. We are leading the way for sunscreen manufacturers in terms of safety and effectiveness, however...
The FDA's rules require that we put our product through costly broad spectrum clinical SPF testing to ensure that the sunscreen works as intended. We need your help in getting our sunscreen the appropriate clinical testing. Additionally, we must move our production to an FDA-approved, organic certified facility and work with chemists to calibrate our formula for mass production. The good news is: there is a manufacturing facility in the Sunshine State that meets our standards for purity.
Introduction
Hi there, we are Lance and Kender Johnson, founders of Live Pure Body Care. For seven years, we have manufactured our very own skin care products and served tens of thousands of these products to the world. These products are unique because they were a vital part of how we recovered our health and how we continue to protect our cells from endocrine disrupting chemicals. These products are NOT made from synthetics whatsoever - no parabens, heavy metals, coal-tar, or hormone-disrupting chemicals. These products are strictly plant-based formulas, with properties that promote skin health.

<p>I am Craig J Hubbard, an Australian Exercise Rehabilitation Industrial Designer and <strong><i>""I need your help to protect millions of young athletes from preventable harm”. </i></strong></p>
<p>As a former professional Basketball player, I had my share of painful and debilitating ankle sprains. I had used both tape and semi-rigid braces but because of their difficulty to apply, cost of taping, or being restrictive of my normal athletic ability, I, like most athletes, often avoided using anything....and again, sprained my ankles.</p>
<p>After seeing another professional player sprain his ankle in a club game I wondered...</p>
<p><strong><i>""Why is it that we can put man on the moon and not prevent the 'common ankle sprain'?"" </i></strong></p>
<p>Well, the answer, after two years of research and surveys of current methods, was <strong><i>""Tape and current brace companies simply do not understand how the ankle works, or they see 'profit' in the injury itself"".</i></strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>Research BEFORE design</strong>.</u></p>
<p>Statements like Delarcerda et al that<i> “… the purpose of ankle taping is to reduce joint range of movement….” </i> have reinforced the <strong>traditional belief</strong> that to protect the ankle from injury it is necessary to restrict the ankle from inverting by <strong>limiting the ankle range of motion (ROM)</strong> in this direction. <br/>Garrick and Requa  have proposed <strong>a theoretical aim of ankle taping </strong><i>“…to <strong>support externally a ligamentous structure without limiting normal range of motion or function. </strong>This support of ligaments<strong> need be present only when the physiologic or normal ranges of motion have been exceeded.</strong>”</i> . They also contend,<i> “….the achievement of this goal, however, is virtually impossible.” </i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><br/><u><strong>The 'common ankle sprain motion'. </strong></u></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>THERE IS A 'SAFE' ZONE</strong> where the<strong> energy can be absorbed and transferred away from the ankle during the sprain motion</strong>, <strong>or returned to the athlete as energy stored</strong> during normal activity.  </li>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>How does a KiSS work?</strong></u></p>
<p>There are at least <strong>2 Patented scientific advances</strong> based on nature, sound physics and engineering that make the KiSS work.</p>
<ul>
<li>A KiSS is designed to <strong>suppress or store a high shock force (the ankle sprain)</strong>. By spreading the force over time throughout the ankle roll motion, it <strong>reduces the 'sudden' force transfer up the leg</strong> as happens with tape and rigid and semi-rigid braces. But how does it do that?</li>
<li>The <strong>yellow strap or 'tongue' </strong>has a high density elastic behind it.  The tongue only comes it action at the <strong>limits of the ankle roll or inversion, preventing any further ankle roll.</strong>  Before it gets to the end range, or the <strong>'DANGER or INJURY zone'</strong>, the elastic has stored most of the force.  If the motion continues, <strong>the yellow tongue comes in and 'catches' you.</strong>
</li>
<li>The KiSS is a <strong>'shock absorber' </strong>for the ankle.</li>
<li>The second part of the patented system, and probably the most significant engineering is the<strong> 'anchor pad'</strong>. <strong>These anchors are capable of a resisting a high shock force</strong>, being designed to mimic the starfish being 'smashed' by waves in the tidal zone.  The anchor is made of the same firm but soft material used in surfboard grip;<strong> It loves getting wet ! </strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>The KiSS both grips onto the skin, and your skin conforms to the 'star' hole design of the anchor, and you grip onto the brace.</i></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<ul><li>
<i><strong>An effectively 'set' anchor is capable of enough shock force holding to prevent the common ankle sprain.</strong></i>  Achieving the proper 'set' or 'anchor' needs two things; firm binding of the anchors and up to 10 minutes to 'grip' or 'mould to the skin. </li></ul>

</div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>So where does the force go? </strong></u> </p>
<p>The force stored in the elastic is <strong>returned to the athlete</strong> when the ankle returns to normal.  As such, <strong>running, jumping and changing directions</strong> is <strong><i>enhanced</i> </strong>not restricted.</p>

As a former professional Basketball player, I had my share of painful and debilitating ankle sprains. I had used both tape and semi-rigid braces but because of their difficulty to apply, cost of taping, or being restrictive of my normal athletic ability, I, like most athletes, often avoided using anything....and again, sprained my ankles.
After seeing another professional player sprain his ankle in a club game I wondered...
""Why is it that we can put man on the moon and not prevent the 'common ankle sprain'?"" 
Well, the answer, after two years of research and surveys of current methods, was ""Tape and current brace companies simply do not understand how the ankle works, or they see 'profit' in the injury itself"".
KiSS understands the athlete's needs as well as the science of ankle function !






 

 

 

 

KiSS Ankle Co. ARE FOCUSED ON PREVENTION NOT INJURY MANAGEMENT.
Social media provides the pathway to change sports and medicine forever. Our mission is to educate parents and athletes directly as to the benefits of PREVENTION.  We already have the support of some of the world's top Ankle Surgeons. See Dr Richie's letter below.
Currently, according to a recent British Journal of Sports Medicine paper, the short and long term costs of the 'common ankle sprain' in short and long term pain and disability, is the highest single cost for any single injury. 
Together, WE can help save millions of young athletes and others prevent or medically rehabilitate the common ankle sprain. 
""Prevention is better than (non) cure"", wrote one of the authors of the BJSM paper when introduced to the KiSS for the first time.
You may not need a KiSS, but you probably know someone who does? 
You may simply want to support the cause of protecting millions of people from pain and suffering, and there are ways to support that cause a variety of  'pledges'. 
KiSS is the Ankle system to change sport and medicine forever...
You and the people you share with, have the power to make that happen !

The 'power' of the Kinetic Impulse Suppression System to prevent the 'common ankle sprain'


 

Research BEFORE design.
Statements like Delarcerda et al that “… the purpose of ankle taping is to reduce joint range of movement….”  have reinforced the traditional belief that to protect the ankle from injury it is necessary to restrict the ankle from inverting by limiting the ankle range of motion (ROM) in this direction. Garrick and Requa  have proposed a theoretical aim of ankle taping “…to support externally a ligamentous structure without limiting normal range of motion or function. This support of ligaments need be present only when the physiologic or normal ranges of motion have been exceeded.” . They also contend, “….the achievement of this goal, however, is virtually impossible.” 
The 'common ankle sprain motion'. 


THERE IS A 'SAFE' ZONE where the energy can be absorbed and transferred away from the ankle during the sprain motion, or returned to the athlete as energy stored during normal activity.  
Your ankle ligaments like the Anterior Talofibular or ATFL are supporting a completely different joint, the up and down motion (dorsi and plantar flexion) that is only injured when the ankle roll reaches its limit.  

Restricting the ankle roll is not only unnecessary, but if done on an injured ankle, can and does lead to long term laxity and disability like arthritis.


 
Why does a KiSS work for prevention and rehabilitation? US Surgeon Dr.Richie Jnr explains.
Important points


Restricting the Ankle Complex alters the entire biomechanical chain of the lower limb and 'breaks' it.

The ankle complex is a 'safety valve' for the lower limb to prevent injury by increasing the time of loading to enable a muscle response and begin the external rotation of the lower limb to 'de-weight' the limb.  

None of that can happen when you use restrictive braces or taping!

And finally there are the detrimental effects on performance due to restrictive methods.

Robinson, Frederick and Cooper  “Directional changes require a large horizontal component of force. Positioning the leg while manoeuvring is accomplished by the normal ROM at the ankle and subtalar joints. If ankle motion is restricted, then the ability to position the leg to apply a large horizontal force component is reduced, decreasing manoeuvrability.” 

In order to maintain the ankle joint surface contact during activity and avoid cartilage damage, the KiSS provides positive tension directed upward through the joint.  This is a goal of taping but Glick et al  demonstrated radiographically the inability of rigid tape to hold the talus within the ankle mortis for any time longer than 20 minutes and was in fact probably effective for less.

By storing and returning the energy of normal motion without restricting anything but the extremes of ROM, the KiSS allows time for normal joint motion to de-weight the ankle and for muscle responses.
By restoring joint integrity and providing a 'safety net' against the ankle sprain, the KiSS restores confidence and eliminates joint pain on walking. This in rehabilitation stimulates repair of ligaments, cartilage and bone through normal activity
Please see the website for the full abstract version of this research completed BEFORE designing the 'cure' for the common ankle sprain.

How does a KiSS work?
There are at least 2 Patented scientific advances based on nature, sound physics and engineering that make the KiSS work.

A KiSS is designed to suppress or store a high shock force (the ankle sprain). By spreading the force over time throughout the ankle roll motion, it reduces the 'sudden' force transfer up the leg as happens with tape and rigid and semi-rigid braces. But how does it do that?
The yellow strap or 'tongue' has a high density elastic behind it.  The tongue only comes it action at the limits of the ankle roll or inversion, preventing any further ankle roll.  Before it gets to the end range, or the 'DANGER or INJURY zone', the elastic has stored most of the force.  If the motion continues, the yellow tongue comes in and 'catches' you.

The KiSS is a 'shock absorber' for the ankle.
The second part of the patented system, and probably the most significant engineering is the 'anchor pad'. These anchors are capable of a resisting a high shock force, being designed to mimic the starfish being 'smashed' by waves in the tidal zone.  The anchor is made of the same firm but soft material used in surfboard grip; It loves getting wet ! 


The KiSS both grips onto the skin, and your skin conforms to the 'star' hole design of the anchor, and you grip onto the brace.
 

An effectively 'set' anchor is capable of enough shock force holding to prevent the common ankle sprain.  Achieving the proper 'set' or 'anchor' needs two things; firm binding of the anchors and up to 10 minutes to 'grip' or 'mould to the skin. 


 

So where does the force go?  
The force stored in the elastic is returned to the athlete when the ankle returns to normal.  As such, running, jumping and changing directions is enhanced not restricted.

Cigarettes, on average, cost approximately $2,600 annually at average of $7 per pack per day. Some pay much more. There are also severe health costs associated with smoking as it is one of the leading causes of preventable deaths worldwide.

Adrian, one of our Founders, became a heavy smoker after high school. Adrian understood after having smoked for 14 years that smoking is self-destructive and created a separation between people close to him and himself. He wanted to quit. After trying patches, gum and cold-turkey all of which failed, he realized he was trapped.His profession is smart automation technology. His personal interest is self-help psychology. At that time, there were no smart fitness bands. He created a self-help message using affirmation psychology and a smart phone. He committed himself to listen to a personally tailored message each time he smoked a cigarette. Four days and 44 cigarettes later, he stopped and has never returned. He experienced the message he created for himself.He sought 20 friends and friend of friends and created a program for them using random Robo calls. It was a limited system, however. The results were miraculous. Eight quit within two weeks. Eight significantly reduced smoking, and four never answered their calls.That his solution worked, gave him inspiration to change lives for the better. However, doing so on a mass scale had to wait until smart wearable technology caught up to the times. Now it’s here, and so is CigFree.When you support CigFree Smartband, you become a critical factor in taking our product from a prototype phase, through its clinical trial phase, and to a full commercial launch that will begin to improve the lives of real people who want to break their nicotine habit once and for all, and quit smoking. The Risks and Costs of Cigarette SmokingThe heavy tolls on families associated with cigarette smoking and the large number of people who continue to smoke and wish to stop is known.  These include financial costs. Cigarettes, on average, cost approximately $2,600 annually at average of $7 per pack per day. Some pay much more. There are also severe health costs associated with smoking as it is one of the leading causes of preventable deaths worldwide. Smokers develop high blood pressure and heart rates increase and clogs blood with carbon monoxide preventing oxygen to flow through the circulatory system. Smoking can cause heart damage and lung cancer raising the risk of death and correspondingly treatment costs. Smoking also causes social problems. Smokers also pay higher health and life insurance premiums.See what happens as soon smokers Quit Smoking?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3I0mJ2RfU0Begin counting how many cigarettes you smoke each day.                                                                                                                                                            iMORPH WANTS TO HELP PEOPLE STOP SMOKING CIGARETTES AND FREE THEMSELVES The iMorph Solution  For an affordable onetime fee, smokers receive a decorative smart band to wear that monitors, in real time, smoking related functions.

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Complications arising from improper medicine usage can be disruptive and exhausting, often resulting in stress, additional health deterioration, and even death in many cases.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Individuals who are taking multiple medications, children, elderly, or busy professionals may have trouble keeping track of their medication schedules and dosing. As a result many people in our communities may live in a state of fear and helplessness.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">These issues are further complicated when healthcare professionals do not have accurate data regarding their patients' medication usage and history. Research has found that more than half of patients tell their doctor they are taking medications as directed when they are not.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">There are many reasons why a person may not take their prescribed medicine. We attempt to address complacency, forgetfulness and complexity with simple reminder and tracking tools. Our innovations are not to compel but to encourage. We are hopeful that with information and understanding harmful habits and attitudes will improve.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Here are some important benefits of Nurse Timers:</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">The <strong>Miracle </strong>allows you to manage your medication without removing the medication from its original container. When it is time to take a dose, Miracle will alert you with lights and sound. Setup is simple because there is nothing to program and no timer to set!</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Will we see the day when our bathrooms are transformed to our primary health clinic? It will not require much effort since the necessary technologies are already available. From smart scales and sensors in our toilet seats to sensors attached to our bodies may all alert us to changes that require attention. These sensors will report to hubs that automatically gather details and may make recommendations to help us plan our daily lives and even a doctor’s visit.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Theoretically. these concepts could monitor everything you ingest, know that you may be sick before you realize, notify your caregiver, make suggestions to adjust your medicine or diet, and even drop off medication by drone delivery while you age-in-place.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Wellness and preventative care must have new tools to educate the consumer and new methods to make participating a fun and productive exercise.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Our primary products are designed for ease of use by consumers even those with physical and mental deficiencies. Future products with locking and metering capabilities will improve safety and reduce stress. Responsible medicine use and data generation from each consumer is the foundation for a new frontier of healthcare possibilities.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We will see improvements in nursing care as the error prone scrolling and constant scanning of patients' wrist bands and medication containers are replaced by a safer and more efficient system.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Nurses have to only pick up a container that is in a state of alert, positively identify the patient with instructions that flashes on the display and give the recommended dosage. This silent alerting system will easily guide a nurse from patient to patient in her charge and make adjustments for the usual interruptions.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The Ten Rights of Medicine Administration (a.k.a. the Ten R's) will be reduced to just one which is verification of the right response by the patient to the medicine. Can you imagine the benefits and possibilities?</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477237866/lrncwjfkhe4c2zl6oldt.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Clinical studies will be expedited as clinicians gain access to realtime data from their patients' use of Nurse Timer Pro devices and other patient generated health data. Medical science becomes more predictive and interventions more efficient when required. A doctor can remotely stop a Nurse Timer from alerting or make other adjustments. Precision medicine has new friends.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Other key stakeholders including pharmacies, doctor’s offices, insurers, Medicaid, Medicare, VA, regulatory institutions and manufacturers will all see opportunities to become more efficient.</p>

<li>
<strong>How do I set or program the device?</strong><br/><br/>For the Miracle and Magic Puck, you must decide on a time that you want to start the first dosing of the day referred to as your Initial Start Time (IST). This can be done by reference to a separate timepiece. NurseTimers have <span style=""background-color: initial;"">factory</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> set timing intervals (once a day, 2 times per day, 3 times per day). The user simply applies power (flashing red light) and start the timer by inserting a medication container at the IST (steady green light).  If the medication bottle is </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">in</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> the device when power is turned on, you will still get a flashing red light. The bottle must be removed and replaced to start the timer.<br/><br/>With the Pro timers (Miracle Pro, Magic Puck Pro, and Polypharmacy Manager), you will be able to set the schedule using any smart device and make a change at any point in time.</span><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>What if I have multiple medications?</strong><br/><br/>Medications that have the same schedule can use one device to indicate the dosing time for all the medication on that schedule.  For example, if you take all your ""once a day"" medicines at the same time in the morning then one ""once a day"" timer is all you need. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Just remember that your Initial Start Time becomes the time that the Nurse Timer will give you an alert each and every day.</span><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Do I have to buy a Nurse Timer for each of my medications?</strong><br/><br/>Medicines that are to be taken at the same time or are on the same schedule may use one Nurse Timer for notification. Take all the meds then pick up and replace the container that is in the Timer to turn the alert back to steady green. Individuals with various medicine schedules, or declining memory and other mental challenges should consider having a Miracle for each medicine or a Polypharmacy Manager.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>What will stop a person from picking up a container but not taking the medicine?  </strong><br/><br/>People need help in managing their medicine and errors are generally not intentional. Nurse Timers are meant for individuals who want to take their medication, and does not prioritize preventing deception.<br/>As development continues, we hope to include a miniature scale inside the Miracle Pro and Polypharmacy Manger. This will allow the Timer to know how much medication is taken every time the bottle is moved.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>What’s to stop a person from taking more than a recommended amount of medicine from the container?  </strong><br/><br/>With models connected to a smart device, the quantity to be consumed will be displayed when a container is picked up. Future Nurse Timer devices will explore options to lock away the  medicine containers and only have a single dose of each medicine be dispensed at <span style=""background-color: initial;"">dosing</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> time.</span><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>What happens during power failures?</strong><br/><br/>During power <span style=""background-color: initial;"">failures,</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> the unit can be connected to an external power pack much like a cell phone mobile power charger. This will allow the unit to function normally during residential power failures. Without a mobile or battery backup, the unit will hold some power reserves to keep the clock running for up to 30 minutes after </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">power</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> failure, </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">however</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> the alert function will be disabled until power is restored. If power loss exceeds 30 minutes, the device will be factory reset.</span><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>How is this different from pill boxes?</strong><br/><br/>Pill boxes <span style=""background-color: initial;"">require</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> taking medication out of their labeled original dispensed containers and putting them into pill compartments </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">labelled</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> with a time of day schedule and also a day of week schedule. Loading up the pill box can be a cumbersome event especially when there are many medicines to be taken and it is easy to make medicine identification errors. No alerts are generally on the specific medicine at </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">dosing</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> time. The system is not suitable for liquids or other medicine formats. Pill boxes will not present a platform for medication access and tracking in realtime. Nurse Timers provide these and many other benefits.</span><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>How is this different/better than Pill-Packs?</strong><br/><br/>Pill Packs <span style=""background-color: initial;"">helps</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> the user by having multiple </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">medication</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> that </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">are</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> on the same schedule to be combined together in a convenient pack.

Complications arising from improper medicine usage can be disruptive and exhausting, often resulting in stress, additional health deterioration, and even death in many cases.
Individuals who are taking multiple medications, children, elderly, or busy professionals may have trouble keeping track of their medication schedules and dosing. As a result many people in our communities may live in a state of fear and helplessness.
These issues are further complicated when healthcare professionals do not have accurate data regarding their patients' medication usage and history. Research has found that more than half of patients tell their doctor they are taking medications as directed when they are not.
There are many reasons why a person may not take their prescribed medicine. We attempt to address complacency, forgetfulness and complexity with simple reminder and tracking tools. Our innovations are not to compel but to encourage. We are hopeful that with information and understanding harmful habits and attitudes will improve.
Here are some important benefits of Nurse Timers:


The Miracle allows you to manage your medication without removing the medication from its original container. When it is time to take a dose, Miracle will alert you with lights and sound. Setup is simple because there is nothing to program and no timer to set!


 


The Magic Puck attaches to the bottom, top, or side of most medication containers. Like the Miracle, each puck uses lights and sounds to notify you when to take medication. Wherever you go, Magic Puck goes with you!


The Nurse Timer Pro models take medication management to the next level. These devices are Bluetooth enabled and automatically log medication usage in realtime whenever a container is picked up or an alert is silenced. The smart capabilities open up limitless features including progress tracking, usage visualization, and alerting family or healthcare professionals about medicine access and dosing irregularities.

And don't worry if you are not tech-savvy! There is no need to interact with smart devices when taking medication. Everything is handled automatically.


OwnUM is your personal medicine management and health record account. Designed to record and track medicine usage automatically. As this software develops, it will also track your weight, blood pressure and other vital information. Know your Numbers! With access and control of your own electronic medical records, you will be better equipped to keep yourself and your loved ones healthy. OwnUM is expected to work with other personal medical records platform, like Blue Button and Athena Health. Simple and portable, an OwnUM account puts you in charge and keeps all your healthcare information in one place.












*Prototypes. Final design in progress.
Polypharmacy Manager consists of multiple Miracle-like devices arranged in a mobile case. The case offers automatic locking features and an intrusion alarm. Locking secures the user’s medication and privacy, and prevents unauthorized access from children and individuals seeking to steal or abuse medication.
Health deterioration is generally slow and may go unnoticed until an episodic event that could be fatal. With the Polypharmacy, seniors can stay safe and caregivers may quickly intervene when irregularies occur. These units are a must have for every senior with multiple health conditions.



The Nurse Timer Miracle Pack is a convenient holder for up to four Miracles.
The Nurse Timer Tray is designed to manage several medications on the same schedule with the use of a single miracle timer. The Tray attaches to the Miracle Pack so that users can manage multiple medicines on up to four different schedules.
To avoid errors if a distraction occurs when responding to an alert, it is recommended that you  take all the medicines out of the tray before stopping the alert. Replace each container as the dose is taken. Additional trays may be in use for medicines on different dosing cycles.



 

Will we see the day when our bathrooms are transformed to our primary health clinic? It will not require much effort since the necessary technologies are already available. From smart scales and sensors in our toilet seats to sensors attached to our bodies may all alert us to changes that require attention. These sensors will report to hubs that automatically gather details and may make recommendations to help us plan our daily lives and even a doctor’s visit.
Theoretically. these concepts could monitor everything you ingest, know that you may be sick before you realize, notify your caregiver, make suggestions to adjust your medicine or diet, and even drop off medication by drone delivery while you age-in-place.
Wellness and preventative care must have new tools to educate the consumer and new methods to make participating a fun and productive exercise.
Our primary products are designed for ease of use by consumers even those with physical and mental deficiencies. Future products with locking and metering capabilities will improve safety and reduce stress. Responsible medicine use and data generation from each consumer is the foundation for a new frontier of healthcare possibilities.
We will see improvements in nursing care as the error prone scrolling and constant scanning of patients' wrist bands and medication containers are replaced by a safer and more efficient system.
Nurses have to only pick up a container that is in a state of alert, positively identify the patient with instructions that flashes on the display and give the recommended dosage. This silent alerting system will easily guide a nurse from patient to patient in her charge and make adjustments for the usual interruptions.
The Ten Rights of Medicine Administration (a.k.a. the Ten R's) will be reduced to just one which is verification of the right response by the patient to the medicine. Can you imagine the benefits and possibilities?

Clinical studies will be expedited as clinicians gain access to realtime data from their patients' use of Nurse Timer Pro devices and other patient generated health data. Medical science becomes more predictive and interventions more efficient when required. A doctor can remotely stop a Nurse Timer from alerting or make other adjustments. Precision medicine has new friends.
Other key stakeholders including pharmacies, doctor’s offices, insurers, Medicaid, Medicare, VA, regulatory institutions and manufacturers will all see opportunities to become more efficient.


*Medicine Wall Unit and Medicine Carrier are not available at this time.







How do I set or program the device?For the Miracle and Magic Puck, you must decide on a time that you want to start the first dosing of the day referred to as your Initial Start Time (IST). This can be done by reference to a separate timepiece. NurseTimers have factory set timing intervals (once a day, 2 times per day, 3 times per day). The user simply applies power (flashing red light) and start the timer by inserting a medication container at the IST (steady green light).  If the medication bottle is in the device when power is turned on, you will still get a flashing red light. The bottle must be removed and replaced to start the timer.With the Pro timers (Miracle Pro, Magic Puck Pro, and Polypharmacy Manager), you will be able to set the schedule using any smart device and make a change at any point in time. 

What if I have multiple medications?Medications that have the same schedule can use one device to indicate the dosing time for all the medication on that schedule.  For example, if you take all your ""once a day"" medicines at the same time in the morning then one ""once a day"" timer is all you need. Just remember that your Initial Start Time becomes the time that the Nurse Timer will give you an alert each and every day. 

Do I have to buy a Nurse Timer for each of my medications?Medicines that are to be taken at the same time or are on the same schedule may use one Nurse Timer for notification. Take all the meds then pick up and replace the container that is in the Timer to turn the alert back to steady green. Individuals with various medicine schedules, or declining memory and other mental challenges should consider having a Miracle for each medicine or a Polypharmacy Manager. 

What will stop a person from picking up a container but not taking the medicine?  People need help in managing their medicine and errors are generally not intentional. Nurse Timers are meant for individuals who want to take their medication, and does not prioritize preventing deception.As development continues, we hope to include a miniature scale inside the Miracle Pro and Polypharmacy Manger. This will allow the Timer to know how much medication is taken every time the bottle is moved. 

What’s to stop a person from taking more than a recommended amount of medicine from the container?  With models connected to a smart device, the quantity to be consumed will be displayed when a container is picked up. Future Nurse Timer devices will explore options to lock away the  medicine containers and only have a single dose of each medicine be dispensed at dosing time. 

What happens during power failures?During power failures, the unit can be connected to an external power pack much like a cell phone mobile power charger. This will allow the unit to function normally during residential power failures. Without a mobile or battery backup, the unit will hold some power reserves to keep the clock running for up to 30 minutes after power failure, however the alert function will be disabled until power is restored. If power loss exceeds 30 minutes, the device will be factory reset. 

How is this different from pill boxes?Pill boxes require taking medication out of their labeled original dispensed containers and putting them into pill compartments labelled with a time of day schedule and also a day of week schedule. Loading up the pill box can be a cumbersome event especially when there are many medicines to be taken and it is easy to make medicine identification errors. No alerts are generally on the specific medicine at dosing time. The system is not suitable for liquids or other medicine formats. Pill boxes will not present a platform for medication access and tracking in realtime. Nurse Timers provide these and many other benefits. 

How is this different/better than Pill-Packs?Pill Packs helps the user by having multiple medication that are on the same schedule to be combined together in a convenient pack. It reduces the need to open several different containers at dosing time. However, pill packs do not provide alerts at dosing times nor can they be used for liquid medications. It may be useful to use a container of pill packs as a container of medicine and use the Nurse Timers for dosing alerts and management. 

How are Nurse Timers different from other smart pill bottles?Nurse Timers can manage dozens of medicines of any format simultaneously for a single user without confusion and at a reasonable cost. There are no monthly service charges associated with Nurse Timers in order to generate dosing notification signals. Nurse Timers works without the need for special caps or special medication containers.",51.0,4,"1 Campaign

We've been in business since 2013 and have successfully delivered thousands of orders. And we're already in production on our multi-use colors, highlighters and lip balm.
 
We are scheduled to receive our production run of the multi-use colors and highlighters sometime in March, and our production run of the lip balm is scheduled to be completed in early April. In the event that we experience any delays, we will keep you notified and communicate with you as soon as we are made aware of them!",23.0,0,"1 Campaign

If you're like I used to be, then you do. And it drives you absolutely nuts. The good news is, we've created quite possibly the most revolutionary and successful sinus congestion and sinus infection treatment in decades - and now we bring it to you!It is all natural, containing nothing but herbs and plants that have been consumed for thousands of years, plus gentle Himalayan salt. It is prepared and used through a Neti Pot, and it goes straight to the root cause of nasal congestion and sinus infections! SinusFreedom may well be the first product that uses latest scientific research to ensure that the actual causes of persistent nasal congestion are addressed and eradicated, and that the root causes of sinus infections are actually treated. So much so that we are applying for a patent on our incredible mixture.  It's based on published, academic journal research conducted by the world's top universities.  Yet these ingredients have never before been used in sinus treatments or employed for their wonderful abilities to clear both common nasal congestion and those pesky sinus infections! Our proprietary, all natural formula uses ingenious advances in science related to sinus congestion and sinus infections to bring relief. SinusFreedom is a Neti Pot solution, using a specific set of herbs and plant extract that recent university research has proven have very unique properties that attack the underlying causes of sinus congestion and sinus infections! The all natural solution contains only herbs and plant extract that have been consumed for thousands of years, as well as Himalayan salt. The solution is infused into water, a bit like tea, and used with a Neti Pot to rinse your sinuses. The ingredients attack the true causes of sinus congestion and sinus infection, removing irritation, reducing inflammation, and killing off the microbes that cause sinus infections.

Whether you are a professional athlete, or just starting out, the EdgeCross-X will rapidly build an incredible core and overall strength to get you into the best shape of your life.


A complete full body fitness system, the EdgeCross-X comes packed with versatility, with a range of functions for every kind of move you can imagine.




 
 
 
 
 
 
 
By putting your center of balance outside of your body’s natural framework, your body has to work that  much harder to stay upright, amplifying the difficulty of every move you do, while working all of your muscles simultaneously.


The EdgeCross-X works by putting the focal point of your balance outside of your body’s natural framework - taking advantage of what we call off balance leverage leverage training.

When you are off balance, your body automatically engages every muscle to maintain stability, providing the most intense and efficient workout possible, quickly providing incredible results.

The further out your focal point is, leverage creates resistance, and the harder your muscles have to work to lift yourself and stay balanced - resulting in the most difficult and efficient workout possible.

By targeting every muscle in the body at the same time, the EdgeCross-X dramatically increases the efficiency of your workout and reduces time spent exercising by up to 90%!


Searching for a better way, we discovered off-balance leverage training as a solution to our issues. If you were somehow able to put your body off-balance while you trained, muscle groups across your entire body would have to work harder to keep you staying upright.We worked tirelessly to develop a full fitness system that applied  these laws of physics. By incorporating resistance bands, balancing wheels, and multiple interchangeable design elements, the system is fully customizable from beginner, intermediate, to advanced and beyond.Together, we created what we’re finally ready to unveil as the full EdgeCross-X system. And we couldn’t be prouder!It’s got it all - all the intensity, all the challenge, and all the style you crave for in the perfect workout product. Built to push your body to the limits in the shortest amount of time possible, the patent pending EdgeCross-X is the next evolution in personal fitness. It’s your secret weapon to get into the best shape of your life... It’s finally ready - are you? The Full EdgeCross-X Training System includes:
1 EdgeCross-X Telescoping Bar
1 EdgeCross-X Balance Wheel
1 pair of Adjustable Handles
2 pairs of Interchangeable End Pieces.
1 pair of Stabilizer Blocks
1 pair of Parallette Attachments
1 pair of Wrist Straps with Rings
1 pair of Foot Straps with Rings
1 Waist Belt with Rings
3 pairs of Fabric Covered Resistance Bands (20lb, 25lb and 30lb)
3 Rubber Resistance Bands (light, med. and heavy)
1 pair of Wrist Wraps
1 EdgeCross-X Carrying Bag
1 EdgeCross-X Branded Workout Mat
The first iteration of the EdgeCross-X system has six main components:Add resistance bands and the balance wheel for added intensity! You can go from ground movements, right into balancing on the wheel, then straight into a parallette routine (featured above).You can easily customize the difficulty of the EdgeCross-X by changing the length of the bar, or adjust the position of the handles to go from beginner to advanced. Switch out the ends for added difficulty ranges.Inherently built for intense, short interval training, the EdgeCross-X is great as a standalone workout, or easily incorporates into your current HIIT, Cross Training, Plyometric, Yoga, Pilates, or Calisthenic routine. Use the EdgeCross-X as a pull-up bar. Add the EdgeCross-X to your yoga routine. Use the bar alone a sledgehammer, or take it apart for double hammer moves. Or try all of the above! Leverage equates to weightless weight. The more leverage you have, the less resistance there is.Take a pencil. Place your index finger on the tip of the pencil and lift. You will feel light resistance. Now, try moving your finger an inch away from the end and press down to try to lift it. It becomes much more difficult because you’ve created more resistance because you have less leverage.Through changing the end pieces or changing handle-positions, you are simulating adding weight to a weight bar by adding additional resistance to your workout through leverage.Imagine having an entire gym you can take with you everywhere - so you never have to miss another workout again! The entire EdgeCross-X training system fits into one small bag so you can take it with you everywhere: home, gym, office, traveling, or wherever you go!No More Excuses!  Everyone can find 10 minutes to get in a great workout.  Boost your mood, confidence, and performance and get in the best shape of your life!There’s a reason the world’s top athletes focus on core strength over any other fitness area: Core fitness is full body fitness.

Not only does it disrupt people's personal and professional lives, but it can also lead to anxiety, depression, and even suicide.Unfortunately, most conventional pain management treatments are piecemeal and, therefore, inadequate.What we need instead is a holistic approach that addresses all biopsychosocial aspects of living with chronic pain: from physical therapy and mental health to peer support and beyond. Here is where WellPrevail's digital platform comes in. It will feature:A mobile app that packs in a handy clinical concierge, daily log, symptom checker, medication management, and physical therapy plan.A companion eHealth web app where people will be able to access psychological consultations, one-on-one coaching, a patient portal, and various educational resources.A private peer-support community portal, where people with chronic pain will be able to ask questions and share their stories.Together, these elements will provide truly holistic support that will empower people with chronic pain and help them lead better and more fulfilling lives. Melissa Chua founded WellPrevail. She holds a Bachelor of Science (Immunology, Pharmacology) and an Master of Philosophy (Medicine) from the University of Sydney, and she used to work as a research officer in Singapore. At present, Ms. Chua is pursuing her second graduate degree at Johns Hopkins University.However, pain management is more than a mere academic and professional interest for Ms. Chua.

<p>I have had the BEST experience with wolfburgh! When I found out that the company donates a part of all sales proceeds to The Canadian Mental Health Association, I immediately wanted to reach out. Not only is the customer service top notch, the equipment is awesome. I’ve received all orders so fast I was shocked - especially with most companies needing weeks or even months waiting periods. I love the packaging, the unique equipment they offer, as well as the complete packages they offer! Makes things so easy for a new person just starting out, but also offers the one offs for people who are building onto their home gym. My clients who have also ordered from wolfburgh have also had great customer service care. I’m so glad I found this little small business!!!</p>

During the launch phase of a new brand it is vital we raise brand awareness and get our mission out into the public domain. 
It's very important that we continue to grow the 'work out support' aspect of the business. I want to give people the best in support/advice when using the equipment. Additional funds will allow me to get more personal trainers onboard to help provide the guidance people need.
We will also use funds to increase inventory and add some new exciting products to the line.

Overtime we want to grow the brand and explore other areas that might help people's  cognitive function,  For example nootropics, getting people to meditate, cold dip etc, vitamins/supplements, encouraging outdoor activity.

We cant achieve any of this without your support to get us off the ground.

<h3>A (hopefully) Brief Introduction</h3>
<p>When we opened our Health Retreat in 2014, we never expected it to grow the way that it has. All we wanted to do was help people understand what healthy living was all about.</p>
<p>We never started it out to become good cooks because that wasn't what we were passionate about. In fact, we even had a chef lined up to join our team and he never arrived. A few days before we were due to open our doors to paying clients, we stopped receiving any contact from the person we had signed up to join our team and naturally, the panic kicked in.</p>
<p>We had people arriving in a few days and something had to be done.</p>
<p>So what do you do when a challenge comes up ?</p>
<p><strong>YOU MAKE A PLAN</strong> and you <strong>JUST DO IT !!</strong></p>
<p>Neither of us (G&amp;J - the Owners of the Retreat) have ever had any formal training in cooking but through our friendship, we had grown to share a mutual love of eating. After all, it is one of THE most important things that we can do - we all know we need food to stay alive - but it goes far deeper than that.</p>
<p>I (Gareth) am the one who does most of the cooking because, well just because it worked out that way. I have never had the greatest relationship with food and have always found it rather boring and mundane. Eating wasn't something I enjoyed because it just wasn't. I won't go into too much detail here but there were times when I just ""forgot"" to eat and that lead to a number of health challenges later on in life.</p>
<p>When I met Jeroen in 2008, my Business Partner and Best Friend, I asked him to help me understand food, and healthy living, better. He shared with me his views and how he chose to live his life, and in doing so, a <strong>new relationship with food began</strong> for me.</p>
<p>I started to<strong> appreciate it</strong>. I started to <strong>value it</strong>. I started to see how food was <strong>SO MUCH MORE than just fuel </strong>and something you  had to do to stay alive. So naturally, when we started our Retreat, we knew that food had to play an important role in what we had to share with the world.</p>
<p>I took this opportunity to<strong> find a way of ""falling in love"" with eating </strong>again. </p>
<p>It was difficult at first. I know how upset I can get if I go somewhere and the food is not that great. So every meal we prepare is a nerve wracking experience. </p>
<p>And now, 2 and a half years later, and requests every week for a Recipe Book, I finally accept that maybe, just maybe, my cooking is good enough for people to want to continue with at home. </p>
<p><strong>The Balance Factor isn't just about food.</strong></p>
<p>It's about SO much more.</p>
<p><strong>It's an experience and a journey into a healthier, happier more balanced life style </strong>- one that leaves you with more time and more freedom to enjoy the things you really love doing and more importantly than that, it's one that leaves you feeling truly satisfied.</p>
<p>It's an experience that takes you through the seasons, providing you with detailed plans of what to eat throughout the year - Warming Winter stews and soups to Sizzling Summer salads and stir fries, Amazing Autumnal roasts and relishes to Scintillating Spring smoothies and sauces.</p>
<p>But healthy living isn't just about food - it's about much, much more and we know from our experience of working with quite a few people, that planning is the key area of challenge when it comes to living a healthy balanced life and The Balance Factor takes all of that into account.</p>
<p>Meal plans, shopping lists, food diaries and exercise plans for the seasons - we have done our best to combine it and put it all in one place for you to enjoy. </p>
<p>You never know, The Balance Factor may just be the last series of Recipe Books you ever need to buy to live the healthy life you've always wanted.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to get this book, or should we say, series of books out into the world, we need your help.</p>
<p>It's taken almost 18 months of consistent, solid hard work to get the format of our books clear and we're pleased to say that we're finally there. We have a structure, we have a list and we're ready to rock and roll.</p>
<p>But publishing a book is expensive. Creating and publishing 4 is even more challenging - but if you know us, you'll know that we do like the odd challenge every now and then.</p>
<p>So, over the course of the next year, we'll be releasing our 4 books - that is, if we achieve the targets we need to get this done.</p>
<p>January 2017 - The Winter Edition</p>
<p>April 2017 - The Spring Collection</p>
<p>July 2017 - The Summer Assortment</p>
<p>October 2017 - The Autumn Arrangement</p>
<p>Each edition (or season) will provide you with plans, recipes, information, exercises and so much more that will, at the end of the year, give you a COMPLETE COLLECTION of everything you need to be healthy and happy.</p>
<p>Recipes will be as seasonal (and simple) as possible, providing your body with what it truly needs during the different times of the year. </p>
<p>Exercises will be tailored and created for you to do in the comfort of your own home, again in line with the times of the year. </p>
<p>We'll include all of the favourite meals from our Retreat, following our Program and structure that we use each week including Easy Meals, Juices &amp; Smoothies, Soups and Salads, Naya Fiesta Meals, Family Favourites and of course, everyone's favourite, Snacks and Treats. </p>
<p>Plans will be structured so that they are as simple to follow as possible, giving you a true balance without having to sit down and think too much. </p>
<p>AND !!</p>
<p>We'll even be running Special Weeks at our Retreat in Spain, dedicated to showing you EXACTLY how we create the meals we do every week. These Gourmet Fitness Weeks will be tied in with the launch of each of the books as they come out so stay posted for more information about those.</p>
<p>We have been in contact with a PR Agency, who we are hoping to sign up and we've had discussions with a Publisher who will help us get everything out into the world, so all contributions will go towards the PR &amp; Publishing Packages we are working on. </p>
<p>Here's the exact breakdown of what is need to get ALL FOUR BOOKS completed and published over the course of the year: -</p>
<p>Publishing and Production Costs - 10,000.00</p>
<p>PR &amp; Marketing - 6,000.00</p>
<p>Indiegogo Fees - 2,600.00</p>
<p>Paypal Fees - 480.00</p>
<p>Order Fulfillment - 2,625.00</p>
<p>Photography - 2,000.00</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When we started our business, we had but one simple aim: -</p>
<p><i><strong>To make the world a healthier and happier place, on person at a time by showing them how simple and fun health can be.</strong></i></p>
<p>We were fed up with the complexity and confusion of living a healthy, balanced life and just want to be balanced, healthy, happy and free. At the end of the day, our aim is to help people feel good, no matter what is going on around us.<br/><br/>Life is too short to continually be counting calories, doing diets, living in the gym and going without rather than living a balanced, happy and fulfilled life. And it’s for this reason we'd really like to finally get this going.</p>
<p>At D-Toxd Living, we live our lives by a Manifesto. </p>
<ul>
<li>We’re bound by a common desire to be healthy and free, but most of all, to have fun and be happy.</li>
<li>We’re not bound by extremes but live our lives to our own extreme limits.</li>
<li>We’re not driven by facts and fear, rather we live by fun and faith.</li>
<li>We’re not ruled by research and are driven by personal results. </li>
<li>And most of all, we’re not focused on the outcome because we embrace the simple pleasure and joy of the journey.</li>
</ul>
<p>And this is our next step towards fulfilling our vision.</p>
<p>We're taking the complex and complicated and doing our best to make it simple and fun again.</p>
<p>We're making it real life, healthy living for one and all.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Right now, the world is awash with some amazing people doing amazing things to help people live healthier lives and we know we have a HUGE task ahead of us. </p>
<p>We're not juice junkies or yogi's who meditate all day, we're not workout warriors and muscle maniacs who live in the gym, we're not fanatics or freaks who live extreme lives and we're not raw foodies or vegans (or even vegetarians) for that matter.</p>
<p>We're not even trained chefs - and this is probably the reason why it has taken it us so long to finally make this decision towards doing this and creating what so many people have asked for.</p>
<p>We're just 2 regular, every day guys, who get stressed every now and then, who feel like throwing the towel in once in a while, who like having a glass of wine or beer with our families, who want to eat junk at times and who like having fun and helping people. We don't think we're anything special or different at all and may that is our downfall - even writing this is a challenge for us because we just do what we do because it helps people and that is that !</p>
<p>We're making it simple so there will be NO calories and content, macro's and micro's, this's and that's - just plain and simple, healthy, balanced living which is something that might put some people off.</p>
<p>We have NO idea how our voice will be heard, or received, but we're willing to give it a go.</p>
<p>Our biggest risk is doing all of the work, raising all of the funds and then being stuck with a box of books under the table and, if the truth be told, it's another thing that has been putting us off.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you've sat down in our Naya and enjoyed our meals with us, all we ask is that you share and share and share - and then share again.</p>
<p>Tell as many people as you can about this.</p>
<p>Use this hash tag whenever you post anywhere - #thebalancefactor</p>
<p>Come find us on Facebook in our Special Group - ""D-Toxd Living - Life Made Good""</p>
<p>Make some noise with us because we would appreciate every single piece of help and support that we can get right now.</p>

<h3>Addicted Veterans Eliminate Opiates After Starting to Ride</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The president of the nonprofit Ride2Recovery told me that more than 60% of veterans he works with, who
had grown addicted to opiates after being treated for battle wounds, eliminated them from their lifestyles after they
started bicycling with his organization. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Bicycling repairs damaged cells and increases the
body’s natural endorphins; strengthens health, physical endurance, and
emotional stability; and </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">builds friendships that can cleanse a former addict's world of shame and isolation.</span></p>
<p>If bicycling can help to heal our wounded veterans, it can help to heal civilians too, keeping them in recovery and freeing up beds for others who will need them.</p>

Veterans Share Stories, Inspire Civilians 


Stephen P. lives in Johnson City, NY.  Two years after his son was treated with Hydrocodone for a sports injury, he grew addicted and died of an overdose.  Stephen tried getting his son into a treatment facility several times, but could not find an available bed anywhere in NY State. 
Nearly two million Americans suffer from addiction to
prescription opioid pain medications. Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of unintentional deaths for Americans ages 25-64.  About 18,000 people die each year from prescription opioid drug overdose. 

Drug treatment centers have the capacity to treat only about 20% of those who need help. Making sure those in recovery stay in recovery is imperative to keeping treatment center beds available for new patients like Stephen's son; and, physical activity can play a critical role. 
In 2008, National Institute on Drug Abuse chief, Dr. Nora Volkow, suggested that physical activity, specifically bicycling, seems to invigorate neurochemicals in the brain. 
 The Hazelden Betty Ford Clinic, in Chicago, has invited our new nonprofit, Pedal4Life, to present a pilot of its ""Pathway to Home"" program to patients.
 Our goal is to bring the program to your community too.

Everything in it serves one purpose: making your skin stronger and more resistant to the damaging effects of the sun. Even its base oils are active: calendula in grape seed oil, carrot oil, mango and cocoa butter. They all care for the sun spots and moles on the skin.</p><p>I started using calendula oil on my skin when I first felt that I wanted to do something to avoid “the next preventive removal of a mole”. But I always only remembered to use it before my regular check-ups, meaning when I was scared. However, on its own calendula oil is not anything nice to use, it smells, it sticks and does not absorb perfectly. This gave me the idea to combine it with other oils and active agents, and develop a <strong>new kind of body lotion for everyday use</strong>, so now I remember to treat my sun spotted skin all year around. And so a body lotion was born which smells good, feels good, hydrates your skin and also makes your skin stronger.</p><p>This body lotion you will love to use, it will give you precious moments, besides being effective and 100% natural. After long term regular use, chances are your moles and sun spots will reduce or pale slightly - personal experience!</p><p>This product is available in 4 scents.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501708564/aqdttn2vkxvwkjpbmbaq.png"" src=""""/></p><p>It doesn't have SPF factor. Always have your moles checked regularly, and if you experience anything unusual, contact your dermatologist immediately.</p><p> </p><p><strong>SUN CREAM</strong></p><p>The best protection for your skin from the harmful effects of the sun. These suncreams include only mineral UV-filter, which is certified by the Food and Drug Administration* (FDA) as effective, broad-spectrum UVA and UVB filter. I used carrot oil, cocoa butter and mango butter, vitamin-E, horse chestnut extract and calendula extract as natural antioxidants to protect delicate skin. These are among the most effective ingredients. These sun creams do not make your skin feel sticky. You can apply them on your face too.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497821641/iu2x5v4mlwlbe3vlaxqp.png"" src=""""/></p><p>They <strong>do not include</strong> any chemical UV filter, any nano form component, added scents, added colorant. The UV filter component is not irritative and does not contain allergens. All ingredients are allowed in natural cosmetics. Check the ingredients and make sure you don’t have personal allergy for any of them.</p><p>Choose the right factor number that corresponds to your skin type and to the UV index number. Apply to body and face 20 minutes before exposure to the sun, then every 2 hours or after swimming, or even more often if you feel you need it.</p><p><i>How I use it:</i></p><p><i>As a morning routine, after  applying my daily face cream I put on ♥︎myskin sun cream SPF25+ and finish it with powder, and I just love the final result.</i></p><p> </p><p><strong>AFTER SUN LOTION</strong></p><p>It feels and smells fresh, just what you need after sunbathing.

Everything in it serves one purpose: making your skin stronger and more resistant to the damaging effects of the sun. Even its base oils are active: calendula in grape seed oil, carrot oil, mango and cocoa butter. They all care for the sun spots and moles on the skin.I started using calendula oil on my skin when I first felt that I wanted to do something to avoid “the next preventive removal of a mole”. But I always only remembered to use it before my regular check-ups, meaning when I was scared. However, on its own calendula oil is not anything nice to use, it smells, it sticks and does not absorb perfectly. This gave me the idea to combine it with other oils and active agents, and develop a new kind of body lotion for everyday use, so now I remember to treat my sun spotted skin all year around. And so a body lotion was born which smells good, feels good, hydrates your skin and also makes your skin stronger.This body lotion you will love to use, it will give you precious moments, besides being effective and 100% natural. After long term regular use, chances are your moles and sun spots will reduce or pale slightly - personal experience!This product is available in 4 scents.It doesn't have SPF factor. Always have your moles checked regularly, and if you experience anything unusual, contact your dermatologist immediately. SUN CREAMThe best protection for your skin from the harmful effects of the sun. These suncreams include only mineral UV-filter, which is certified by the Food and Drug Administration* (FDA) as effective, broad-spectrum UVA and UVB filter. I used carrot oil, cocoa butter and mango butter, vitamin-E, horse chestnut extract and calendula extract as natural antioxidants to protect delicate skin. These are among the most effective ingredients. These sun creams do not make your skin feel sticky. You can apply them on your face too.They do not include any chemical UV filter, any nano form component, added scents, added colorant. The UV filter component is not irritative and does not contain allergens. All ingredients are allowed in natural cosmetics. Check the ingredients and make sure you don’t have personal allergy for any of them.Choose the right factor number that corresponds to your skin type and to the UV index number. Apply to body and face 20 minutes before exposure to the sun, then every 2 hours or after swimming, or even more often if you feel you need it.How I use it:As a morning routine, after  applying my daily face cream I put on ♥︎myskin sun cream SPF25+ and finish it with powder, and I just love the final result. AFTER SUN LOTIONIt feels and smells fresh, just what you need after sunbathing. It is different from the body lotion because the focus of development was on what the skin needs directly after the sun. This is a lighter formula with water soluble vitamins in higher concentration but not less active agents. Use it to soothe your skin after sun exposure. BODY BUTTERThis product is a combination of butters and oil only:  mango butter, cocoa butter, shea butter, coconut oil and beeswax. You can use it as part of your daily routine body care if you prefer oil or butter instead of lotion or cream. Or on the beach as a natural tan accelerator in the morning and the late afternoon hours. It does not have SPF factor.How I use it:When I already have some tan, I like to put it on for the final hours of sunbathing as it nicely mixes with the SPF cream I use for the day. It gives my skin a beautiful glowing color.  PERKSBuy single products for a great EARLY BIRD discount in limited number or if you miss this opportunity buy single products for list price, OR choose from the following  packages and reach a discount of up to 20% percent!

<p>In 2013, Kelsey Meyer, President of Influence and Co., wrote in<a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/85broads/2013/07/08/why-more-women-should-create-apps/#32def7417e5b"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Forbes</a> that not only are women who create apps in the minority, but there is also a dearth of apps <strong><i>for women, by women. </i></strong>She states  specifically<strong><i>  </i></strong><i>""</i><strong><i>more women should be involved in the process of conceptualizing, building, marketing, and monetizing mobile apps</i></strong>"".  Kelly’s research shows that the number one on the list women want list is...</p>
<p><strong>""<i>A fitness app that specifically caters to women, or as my co-worker described it, “doesn’t look like it was based on a men’s locker room design”</i></strong></p>
<p><i><strong>Enter SheAPP!</strong></i> </p>
<p>Tam Williams, Founder of She’s It came to a similar conclusion from her extensive research – while there are apps for women by women in many areas of health, <strong><i>there are none that takes a wholistic 360° view that both combines and integrates fitness,  health and well-being that focuses on adding value to women’s lives. </i></strong>There are none that make the data, mostly similar with the wearables and other fitness apps, meaningful enough to keep users engaged and working on their fitness and overall well-being for the long term. As a result, Tam set out on a mission to  bring <strong><i>360° Well-Being </i></strong>to the  market.</p>

<p>Imagine having 3 to 8 different apps in front of you. An app for fitness. An app for health concerns. An app for food and exercise. An app for music. An app to connect with others for meetups and online socializing. An app for reminders and an app for other things you want to do. You get the picture. <strong><i><u>Alone</u></i>,</strong> each app has attributes worthy of having on a journey to increase health and fitness. The caveat is that each app is different and has to be downloaded as a separate app. Now imagine, once you access those apps, they don't even talk to one another. This can be a frustrating experience!</p>
<p>As virtually all the women contacted in the early stages of research reported, their time and focus is very valuable!  We heard loud and clear that women want one app that includes several functions to give the most value for their time.  </p>

<p><strong><i>SheAPP is a native app that is truly <u>a game changer</u>! </i></strong> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508257337/wgp3rumpohfeg4b8xphf.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>SheAPP is a game changer because it connects to the lives, stories and aspriations of women and girls on their journeys to living a more healthy and wellthy life. By focusing on three crucial areas of health and well-being, SheAPP is the first app that takes women from their bodies, to their lives, their families and communities and their worlds, back again to their bodies. </p>
<p>1.  <i><strong>Body Composition:</strong></i>  With the plethora of concerns with body image among women, SheAPP is taking a proactive approach.   Body composition gives information about the overall body’s status of  health respect to percentages of fat vs lean muscle mass.  <i><strong>What will become evident and a learning curve for women and girls is that what counts is what is on the inside… not on the outside.  </strong></i> Our mission is for <i><strong>SheAPP to distill the shame associated with body image and turn the focus to a healthy wellthy mindset starting with an internally healthy body. </strong>My Food/Moves is an integral part of  body composition, as is the capacity to document one's eating and move activities through My Planner.</i></p>
<p><i>2. <strong>Conversations ELM:  </strong></i>We know that one's mindset is so critical to well-being. SheAPP acknowledges this by providing crucial avenues for women to engage, learn and be motivated  in areas that matter to them!  Both My Communities and My ELMs support women in this by connecting them wth women around the world  who are concerned and care about the same areas, from Aging to Work. </p>
<p><i><i>3. </i><strong>Data:  </strong></i>Data is the linchpin that links and supports each feature! Data by itself is just data!  However, data becomes meaningful when it helps to shape conversations women and girls have about their bodies and their lives. The data from each feature of SheAPP builds an overall picture of the member with patterns and trends they can then engage, learn and be motivated to act upon. It’s one thing to know when you’ve hit a certain goal with steps. It’s quite another to be able to act upon a multitude of data that motivates you to move beyond the scale. </p>
<p>Through voice, touch and vibration, SheAPP integrates and connects each feature of SheAPP thus enabling members to visualize and act on not just their fitness/health levels but rather on the total 360°Well-Being experience. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>_______________</strong></p>
<p><u><strong>The Need for SheAPP</strong></u></p>
<p><strong><i><u>A. Health and Fitness Concerns: The Importance of Body Composition Data </u></i></strong></p>
<p>Th utility patent pending <strong><i>My Personal Body Blueprint</i> </strong>is SheAPP’s innovative approach to  individual access to one’s body composition data, <strong><i><u>data that is now recognized to lowering health-related costs and increasing healthy behaviors.</u></i></strong></p>
<p><strong>Part 1:</strong>  During the research phase of SheAPP, research in medical and exercise/fitness journals consistently cite how the concept of health has developed from a concern of weight, height and body mass index (BMI) to a comprehensive understanding of the importance of  “body composition”.  Simply stepping on a scale and measuring your weight unfortunately is not an indicator of your quality of health. Body composition is more than weight. Body composition is the analysis that distinguishes between pounds that come from body fat and lean body mass, water or muscle. A body composition within the recommended range of body fat and lean body mass suggests less risk of developing obesity-related diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and even some cancers. <strong><i>Simply put, any serious digital devices designed to support overall health towards improving quality of life needs to include body composition data.</i></strong></p>
<p>The research phase also uncovered that this type of data about one’s body health is primarily available in doctor’s offices, physical therapy/other rehabilitation-focused offices, or high-end fitness centers.  These analyses can be quite costly and used primarily when an individual is already at significant health risk due to disease, condition or injury.  High-level performance athletes also access this type of health information to monitor their status relative to the performance anticipated in the specific activity/sport.   </p>
<p>Rather, when this kind of data is made available on a mobile device as in our SheAPP,  it allows users to track changes in real time when engaging in healthier behaviors.  Data then changes from a static measurement to a dynamic mirror for choice and decision-making. Data is then owned.</p>
<p>As a woman, Tam knows the history of body image and has struggled with health, fitness, and wellness issues for many years. Carol has also had her issues with her body and knows just how society’s images of what constitutes an “appropriate” body is not only outdated, its degrading and shaming of women.   <i><strong>SheAPP wants to distill the shame associated with body image and turn the focus to a healthy mindset starting with an internally healthy body.</strong></i></p>
<p><u><i>SheAPP is a welcome addition to the health/fitness/well-being app market!</i></u></p>
<p><i><strong>SheAPP’s Got This!</strong></i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>_______________</strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong><u>B. Behavioral Change Attributes</u></strong></i></p>
<p>SheAPP is designed to work with the widespread consensus that successful intervention <strong>design demands a user-centered and iterative approach to development, using mixed methods to progressively refine the intervention to meet user requirements. </strong> </p>
<p>SheAPP, in this first iteration, is planning a comprehensive beta test from women who are advocates and/or early adaptors to provide both qualitative and quantitative feedback for future design iterations.  <strong>This feedback will assist us to move the needle from increasing engagement to increasing <i>“effective”</i> engagement...</strong>engagement with the features of SheAPP to achieve intended healthy wellthy outcomes.<strong>  <u>That is our ultimate goal.</u></strong></p>
<p>This being said, SheAPP is based on a conception of 360° of Well-Being.   Well-being in our mind is a continuing process of Engagement, Learning and Motivation for <i><strong>effective </strong></i>engagement in one's life and the world.  SheAPP not only uses regular attributes other apps use to support user engagement, <i><strong>t</strong></i><i><strong><i><strong>h</strong>e</i> integration of six apps allows us to significantly expand ways to  more effectively engage women on thir healthy wellthy journey. </strong></i> Included in SheAPP are planned social supports and opportunities for social comparison, as well as informational and educational premier content designed to help women expand their understanding not only of their bodies but also how other areas such as Kindness and Inspiration contribute to their 360° Well-Being. Members will also be able to suggest additional content as their needs and understandings changes.  All this from our considerable research (including the linked article) in how <a href=""http://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(16)30243-4/fulltext"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">to create apps that have the most beneficial changes in behaviors</a> !  </p>
<p><strong><i>No other health/fitness/well-being app on the market offers and integrates  this many ways to significantly engage women in their journey to a healthier lifestyle. And it's only the beginning!</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>SheAPP’s Got This!  </i></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>______________</i></strong></p>
<p><strong>Tam's and Carol's Story</strong></p>
<p>The SheAPP is a signature product of She’s It, LLC, a company that Tam Williams, President and Founder, began in her home at the same time she was head of global education and corporate communications for an international technology firm. Tam knows the benefits of a healthy lifestyle, having run in several half- marathons. She’s It began from her vision to help women lead a healthy lifestyle because, as she was experiencing negative effects of stress on her body, mind and heart, she also knew too many women in similar circumstances.  The more intense the stress became in her corporate world; the more convinced Tam was that her vision was needed.</p>
<p>Then it happened – let go but as Tam says, fired at 55, and Tam was angry, shocked, and scared. Even though Tam knew <i><strong>She’s It </strong></i>held the answer for her vision, she was never quite ready to give up the status and income of her corporate job. When the hammer dropped, she knew it was time… time to take <strong>She’s It</strong> to the next level and begin the painstaking process of building the company and creating <strong>SheAPP</strong> from blueprint designs and beginning formulations to a real product.  </p>
<p>Tam was in the same situation of many of the women she wanted to help; 55 years old, suddenly unemployed, and in compromised health. Being both a black woman and planning to bring a technology product to market based on a vision, Tam had already overcome significant obstacles just to arrive at this place. Tam originally became an entrepreneur after fleeing to the west coast with her young children in tow, to put 3,000 miles between them and an abusive spouse. The obstacles she endured gave her the experience she needed to become not only a successful business woman, but, also a strong advocate for women, minorities and small business.  As a media unknown, Tam overcame insurmountable odds by producing shows on Talk Radio Row at both the 2004 Democratic National Convention and the 2004 Republican National Convention.  It was her intelligence, energy and entrepreneurial success that opened the doors to the corporate world that then decided she didn’t fit because of her advocacy for people and a willingness to speak up.</p>
<p>But this time the move to fulltime business owner was different. While Tam was in the throes of getting back to her vision, she knew she didn’t want to take this journey alone. Tam then met Dr. Carol Pate, a former college professor in teacher education who also in her fifties was found “not fit” after 11 years in her position as Department Chair with  over 6M in grant funding to her department to bring a vision of educational excellence for urban teaching to life.</p>
<p>Carol was no stranger to overcoming obstacles having left home in high school for her own safety. Finishing high school and then funding her own way to college, she moved from the southwest to the midwest and then to Philadelphia while working and continuing her education. It was the 2016 election and the ensuing Women’s March in January of 2017 that led Carol to understand that her 30+ year mission of helping those who were left out  of society not only included women but, in 2017, women needed to be her focus. </p>
<p>Tam’s successful global-level communications and business technology experiences, women-centered vision and laser-like focus for excellence in functionality shapes the SheAPP!  Everything from design, functionality and user experience is threaded through women’s needs and desires.  Carol’s vision and experience for what is possible to shape conversations leads the development of the content media piece. The SheAPP now has double the energy, determination, focus and drive through Tam and Carol to help further women’s engagement, learning and motivation to 360° well-being.  </p>

<p><strong><i><u>Why Is This Campaign Important?  </u></i><u><i>The Impact​ of Your Support!</i></u></strong></p>
<p>The SheAPP campaign is raising awareness and increasing effective engagement <strong><i>by and for women</i></strong> in their Healthy Wellthy Journey towards 360° of well-being. <i><strong>We are on a mission to involve women all over the world in their own individual journey to a healthier lifestyle, one woman and one girl at a time!</strong></i> </p>
<p>We believe that effective engagement with the SheAPP will shape the conversation women have about their health, fitness and well-being from “no time for this” to “I need all of this” for my Healthy Wellthy Journey. </p>
<p><i><strong>Every women needs to know and experience that it is good that “Everybody is different, and every “BODY” is different. </strong></i> We believe that engagement with the SheAPP  will move the conversation women have about what they look like on the outside to how healthy they are on the inside! </p>
<p><i><strong>Every woman needs to have the right to how they see their body, their data and their lives. </strong></i> We believe that engagement with the SheAPP will shape the conversation so every woman will proudly proclaim My Body, My Data, My Life! It’s time for women to take more charge of how they see, feel, care and say about THEIR bodies!</p>
<p><i><strong>We need support to continue the development of SheAPP to its first full iteration. </strong></i> At this juncture, SheAPP has been self-funded to complete the MPBB and My Food/Moves features.</p>
<p>As you can imagine – creating a native app is one of the most complicated and comprehensive processes requiring a laser-like focus on user experience.</p>
<p><i><strong>We need support to continue this painstaking and thorough development so that women everywhere  will truly benefit from our work.  We want nothing better than to have thousands, if not millions  of women to be a part of our critical development and beta testing.</strong></i> </p>
<p>We know that feedback and ideas from more women will make it even better – for all women to effectively engage in 360° Well-Being!</p>

<p><strong>FAQ's</strong></p>
<p><i><strong>Will SheAPP be available on different mobile devices?</strong></i></p>
<p>Yes! SheAPP  will be available across on iOS and Android mobile devices. Reaching our challenge goals as early as possible will significantly impact the health of women across the globe. </p>
<p><i><strong>What if I have a wearable such as Fitbit?</strong></i></p>
<p>A wearable isn't needed to use and be a SheAPP member. However, we will be syncing our data with the following wearable devices: FitBit, Apple Health, Garmin, MisFit, Samsung. </p>
<p><i><strong>Do I have to have machine-generated body composition data to use SheAPP?</strong></i></p>
<p>No. While that is the optimal way to use the My Personal Body Blueprint feature, it's not the only way. You can input your information to use the feature manually until you are able to access the machine generated composition data.</p>
<p><i><strong>I am a Personal Trainer. Can I use SheAPP with my clients?</strong></i></p>
<p>Yes! As long as you both use SheAPP, you can set up a personal community with individual and group clients. But...since we are HIPAA compliant, only your client can give you access to their MPBB information which is done through our She's It and SheAPP privacy protocol.</p>
<p><i><strong>How Can I See my 3D image?</strong></i></p>
<p>If you have participated in a scan, your 3D image will show in the My Personal Body Blueprint feature of SheAPP.</p>
<p><i><strong>Is SheAPP in the App Store now?</strong></i></p>
<p>No, SheAPP is currently development going through rigorous testing. We have the agreements and business processes in place so that once SheAPP is ready, you will be able to download directly from the  iTunes, Google Play and Amazon!</p>
<p><i><strong>Will SheAPP be available around the world ?</strong></i></p>
<p>Yes. SheAPP will be available around the globe. </p>
<p><i><strong>My Company should use this. Is SheAPP available for corporations?</strong></i></p>
<p>Yes. We have SheAPP Corporate! A full wellness program that provides your employees with an integrated approach to health and wellness. </p>
<p><strong>Risks and Challenges </strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>The risks are that the world's women  won't have a chance to recieve this and they will continue to have a fragmented system not contributing to any meaningful 360° well-being! <i><strong>This is your chance to participate in a real-time creation of a fitness/health/wellness SheAPP ""for women by women""! </strong></i></p>
<p>Our company will be challenged with creating an infrastructrue to fully support the explosion we are anticipating as women begin to see the real-time benefts of SheAPP!  We are continually seeking the best advice and supports for continual adaptation and support of the SheAPP. </p>

In 2013, Kelsey Meyer, President of Influence and Co., wrote in Forbes that not only are women who create apps in the minority, but there is also a dearth of apps for women, by women. She states  specifically  ""more women should be involved in the process of conceptualizing, building, marketing, and monetizing mobile apps"".  Kelly’s research shows that the number one on the list women want list is...
""A fitness app that specifically caters to women, or as my co-worker described it, “doesn’t look like it was based on a men’s locker room design”
Enter SheAPP! 
Tam Williams, Founder of She’s It came to a similar conclusion from her extensive research – while there are apps for women by women in many areas of health, there are none that takes a wholistic 360° view that both combines and integrates fitness,  health and well-being that focuses on adding value to women’s lives. There are none that make the data, mostly similar with the wearables and other fitness apps, meaningful enough to keep users engaged and working on their fitness and overall well-being for the long term. As a result, Tam set out on a mission to  bring 360° Well-Being to the  market.

SheAPP  - Designed with Women in Mind

SheAPP is the  total Go-To place for 360° Well-Being for a HEALTHy WELLthy Journey.  Voice and touch opens pathways for women to design their life around increased health and well-being.  Imagine, start every day with an audio motivational to give you inspiration for whatever the day may bring.  Swipe again to read a related motivational quote and swipe once more for a tip or two for getting through the day.  You can start every day with SheAPP.

Leading SheAPP’s creation from day one, Tam Williams, Founder and President of She’s It, LLC uses her successful entrepreneurial, global-level communications, business technology, women-centered vision and laser-like focus for excellence in functionality to ensure that SheAPP is for women, by women, giving an experience unlike any other.

Everything from design, functionality and user experience was carefully researched and is threaded through the question – ""what is the experience we want to provide to women that they don't currently get?""
1) Engagement with meaningful data about themselves
2) Learning what the data means and how to apply it for betterment of themselves
3) Motivation to act, share and be social about their  HEALTHy WELLthy Journey 
This allows for a collaborative yet empowering experience! Women shaping the conversation for a HEALTHy WELLthy Journey by using SheAPP.

How Does SheAPP Work?

Imagine having 3 to 8 different apps in front of you. An app for fitness. An app for health concerns. An app for food and exercise. An app for music. An app to connect with others for meetups and online socializing. An app for reminders and an app for other things you want to do. You get the picture. Alone, each app has attributes worthy of having on a journey to increase health and fitness. The caveat is that each app is different and has to be downloaded as a separate app. Now imagine, once you access those apps, they don't even talk to one another. This can be a frustrating experience!
As virtually all the women contacted in the early stages of research reported, their time and focus is very valuable!  We heard loud and clear that women want one app that includes several functions to give the most value for their time.  
SheAPP’s Got That!

_______________
 
SheAPP is The ONE APP that tracks meaningful data points for good health and overall fitness: 

Starting with Leona, you'll begin your journey collecting and curating body composition data into My Personal Body Blueprint (MPBB),  allowing you to move beyond the scale and visualize a healthier you. Through MPBB, you get more accurate data, allowing for motivation and inspiration by seeing those critical data points that apply only to your body.  The MPBB feature can also transform data into a 3D image so that you can see where your body composition lives, from top to bottom and side to side.  You can even turn your image 360°!   This optional function is for women who know they need to be healthier, and as their health changes, so does their body. *Note: 3D image is available using our Partnering resources.

Over the weeks and months, you will see how your foods, your times and your movements (aka exercise), connect in ways that are meaningful for your best fitness and health. It's all about meaningful data!

360° Well-Being for a HEALTHY WELLTHY Journey.
 
SheAPP is NOT 3 apps, NOT4 apps, NOT 5 apps, and NOT 6 apps – it’s One APP. No need to go outside SheAPP to engage, learn and be motivated to begin your HEALTHy, WELLthy Journey!  
SheAPP's Got ALL That!
_______________
SheAPP is a native app that is truly a game changer!  

SheAPP is a game changer because it connects to the lives, stories and aspriations of women and girls on their journeys to living a more healthy and wellthy life. By focusing on three crucial areas of health and well-being, SheAPP is the first app that takes women from their bodies, to their lives, their families and communities and their worlds, back again to their bodies. 
1.  Body Composition:  With the plethora of concerns with body image among women, SheAPP is taking a proactive approach.   Body composition gives information about the overall body’s status of  health respect to percentages of fat vs lean muscle mass.  What will become evident and a learning curve for women and girls is that what counts is what is on the inside… not on the outside.   Our mission is for SheAPP to distill the shame associated with body image and turn the focus to a healthy wellthy mindset starting with an internally healthy body. My Food/Moves is an integral part of  body composition, as is the capacity to document one's eating and move activities through My Planner.
2. Conversations ELM:  We know that one's mindset is so critical to well-being. SheAPP acknowledges this by providing crucial avenues for women to engage, learn and be motivated  in areas that matter to them!  Both My Communities and My ELMs support women in this by connecting them wth women around the world  who are concerned and care about the same areas, from Aging to Work. 
3. Data:  Data is the linchpin that links and supports each feature! Data by itself is just data!  However, data becomes meaningful when it helps to shape conversations women and girls have about their bodies and their lives. The data from each feature of SheAPP builds an overall picture of the member with patterns and trends they can then engage, learn and be motivated to act upon. It’s one thing to know when you’ve hit a certain goal with steps. It’s quite another to be able to act upon a multitude of data that motivates you to move beyond the scale. 
Through voice, touch and vibration, SheAPP integrates and connects each feature of SheAPP thus enabling members to visualize and act on not just their fitness/health levels but rather on the total 360°Well-Being experience.

The Need for SheAPP
A. Health and Fitness Concerns: The Importance of Body Composition Data 
Th utility patent pending My Personal Body Blueprint is SheAPP’s innovative approach to  individual access to one’s body composition data, data that is now recognized to lowering health-related costs and increasing healthy behaviors.
Part 1:  During the research phase of SheAPP, research in medical and exercise/fitness journals consistently cite how the concept of health has developed from a concern of weight, height and body mass index (BMI) to a comprehensive understanding of the importance of  “body composition”.  Simply stepping on a scale and measuring your weight unfortunately is not an indicator of your quality of health. Body composition is more than weight. Body composition is the analysis that distinguishes between pounds that come from body fat and lean body mass, water or muscle. A body composition within the recommended range of body fat and lean body mass suggests less risk of developing obesity-related diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and even some cancers. Simply put, any serious digital devices designed to support overall health towards improving quality of life needs to include body composition data.
The research phase also uncovered that this type of data about one’s body health is primarily available in doctor’s offices, physical therapy/other rehabilitation-focused offices, or high-end fitness centers.  These analyses can be quite costly and used primarily when an individual is already at significant health risk due to disease, condition or injury.  High-level performance athletes also access this type of health information to monitor their status relative to the performance anticipated in the specific activity/sport.   
Rather, when this kind of data is made available on a mobile device as in our SheAPP,  it allows users to track changes in real time when engaging in healthier behaviors.  Data then changes from a static measurement to a dynamic mirror for choice and decision-making. Data is then owned.
As a woman, Tam knows the history of body image and has struggled with health, fitness, and wellness issues for many years. Carol has also had her issues with her body and knows just how society’s images of what constitutes an “appropriate” body is not only outdated, its degrading and shaming of women.   SheAPP wants to distill the shame associated with body image and turn the focus to a healthy mindset starting with an internally healthy body.
SheAPP is a welcome addition to the health/fitness/well-being app market!
SheAPP’s Got This!

B. Behavioral Change Attributes
SheAPP is designed to work with the widespread consensus that successful intervention design demands a user-centered and iterative approach to development, using mixed methods to progressively refine the intervention to meet user requirements.  
SheAPP, in this first iteration, is planning a comprehensive beta test from women who are advocates and/or early adaptors to provide both qualitative and quantitative feedback for future design iterations.  This feedback will assist us to move the needle from increasing engagement to increasing “effective” engagement...engagement with the features of SheAPP to achieve intended healthy wellthy outcomes.  That is our ultimate goal.
This being said, SheAPP is based on a conception of 360° of Well-Being.   Well-being in our mind is a continuing process of Engagement, Learning and Motivation for effective engagement in one's life and the world.  SheAPP not only uses regular attributes other apps use to support user engagement, the integration of six apps allows us to significantly expand ways to  more effectively engage women on thir healthy wellthy journey.  Included in SheAPP are planned social supports and opportunities for social comparison, as well as informational and educational premier content designed to help women expand their understanding not only of their bodies but also how other areas such as Kindness and Inspiration contribute to their 360° Well-Being. Members will also be able to suggest additional content as their needs and understandings changes.  All this from our considerable research (including the linked article) in how to create apps that have the most beneficial changes in behaviors !  
No other health/fitness/well-being app on the market offers and integrates  this many ways to significantly engage women in their journey to a healthier lifestyle. And it's only the beginning!
SheAPP’s Got This!  
______________
Tam's and Carol's Story
The SheAPP is a signature product of She’s It, LLC, a company that Tam Williams, President and Founder, began in her home at the same time she was head of global education and corporate communications for an international technology firm. Tam knows the benefits of a healthy lifestyle, having run in several half- marathons. She’s It began from her vision to help women lead a healthy lifestyle because, as she was experiencing negative effects of stress on her body, mind and heart, she also knew too many women in similar circumstances.  The more intense the stress became in her corporate world; the more convinced Tam was that her vision was needed.
Then it happened – let go but as Tam says, fired at 55, and Tam was angry, shocked, and scared. Even though Tam knew She’s It held the answer for her vision, she was never quite ready to give up the status and income of her corporate job. When the hammer dropped, she knew it was time… time to take She’s It to the next level and begin the painstaking process of building the company and creating SheAPP from blueprint designs and beginning formulations to a real product.  
Tam was in the same situation of many of the women she wanted to help; 55 years old, suddenly unemployed, and in compromised health. Being both a black woman and planning to bring a technology product to market based on a vision, Tam had already overcome significant obstacles just to arrive at this place. Tam originally became an entrepreneur after fleeing to the west coast with her young children in tow, to put 3,000 miles between them and an abusive spouse. The obstacles she endured gave her the experience she needed to become not only a successful business woman, but, also a strong advocate for women, minorities and small business.  As a media unknown, Tam overcame insurmountable odds by producing shows on Talk Radio Row at both the 2004 Democratic National Convention and the 2004 Republican National Convention.  It was her intelligence, energy and entrepreneurial success that opened the doors to the corporate world that then decided she didn’t fit because of her advocacy for people and a willingness to speak up.
But this time the move to fulltime business owner was different. While Tam was in the throes of getting back to her vision, she knew she didn’t want to take this journey alone. Tam then met Dr. Carol Pate, a former college professor in teacher education who also in her fifties was found “not fit” after 11 years in her position as Department Chair with  over 6M in grant funding to her department to bring a vision of educational excellence for urban teaching to life.
Carol was no stranger to overcoming obstacles having left home in high school for her own safety. Finishing high school and then funding her own way to college, she moved from the southwest to the midwest and then to Philadelphia while working and continuing her education. It was the 2016 election and the ensuing Women’s March in January of 2017 that led Carol to understand that her 30+ year mission of helping those who were left out  of society not only included women but, in 2017, women needed to be her focus. 
Tam’s successful global-level communications and business technology experiences, women-centered vision and laser-like focus for excellence in functionality shapes the SheAPP!  Everything from design, functionality and user experience is threaded through women’s needs and desires.  Carol’s vision and experience for what is possible to shape conversations leads the development of the content media piece. The SheAPP now has double the energy, determination, focus and drive through Tam and Carol to help further women’s engagement, learning and motivation to 360° well-being.

Why Is This Campaign Important?  The Impact​ of Your Support!
The SheAPP campaign is raising awareness and increasing effective engagement by and for women in their Healthy Wellthy Journey towards 360° of well-being. We are on a mission to involve women all over the world in their own individual journey to a healthier lifestyle, one woman and one girl at a time! 
We believe that effective engagement with the SheAPP will shape the conversation women have about their health, fitness and well-being from “no time for this” to “I need all of this” for my Healthy Wellthy Journey. 
Every women needs to know and experience that it is good that “Everybody is different, and every “BODY” is different.  We believe that engagement with the SheAPP  will move the conversation women have about what they look like on the outside to how healthy they are on the inside! 
Every woman needs to have the right to how they see their body, their data and their lives.  We believe that engagement with the SheAPP will shape the conversation so every woman will proudly proclaim My Body, My Data, My Life! It’s time for women to take more charge of how they see, feel, care and say about THEIR bodies!
We need support to continue the development of SheAPP to its first full iteration.  At this juncture, SheAPP has been self-funded to complete the MPBB and My Food/Moves features.
As you can imagine – creating a native app is one of the most complicated and comprehensive processes requiring a laser-like focus on user experience.
We need support to continue this painstaking and thorough development so that women everywhere  will truly benefit from our work.  We want nothing better than to have thousands, if not millions  of women to be a part of our critical development and beta testing. 
We know that feedback and ideas from more women will make it even better – for all women to effectively engage in 360° Well-Being!
 
Help fund this FIRST comprehensive health/fitness/well-being app designed for and by women.

The magnitude of what YOU contribute to help SheAPP come to life!
SheAPP is a total game changer that is integrative, supportive and designed with women in mind. Women using SheAPP will be so amazed at what is possible for them – ALL IN ONE PLACE! 
Imagine being part of the history this SheAPP is making –  help us bring the first version of the SheAPP product to market in December of 2017!  
The first comprehensive health/fitness/wellness app designed by and for women!
The first app that knows and supports Every body is different; every “BODY” is different!
This app will be the first of its kind, and now more than ever, it needs to exist.
________________
What We Need & What You Get

 

Funding in the amount of $40,000 is needed to complete the next iteration of features for  SheAPP  1.0 to be delivered to market in December of 2017.  This includes all user interface and coding for top performance functionality. 
 

Our first stretch goal of $60,000 will allow us to continue SheAPP on other platforms including syncing integration.  The sooner we reach our stretch goal, the sooner we can begin. We don’t want to leave any women out of this opportunity because of wearable loyalty!   
 
Our second stretch goal of $90,000.00 will ensure that SheAPP is on track for proposed feature implementations for 2018 including SheAPP 1.1. 
Please consider backing this and helping us have the possibility.
Here is the timeline for the SheAPP:

_______________
FAQ's
Will SheAPP be available on different mobile devices?
Yes! SheAPP  will be available across on iOS and Android mobile devices. Reaching our challenge goals as early as possible will significantly impact the health of women across the globe. 
What if I have a wearable such as Fitbit?
A wearable isn't needed to use and be a SheAPP member. However, we will be syncing our data with the following wearable devices: FitBit, Apple Health, Garmin, MisFit, Samsung. 
Do I have to have machine-generated body composition data to use SheAPP?
No. While that is the optimal way to use the My Personal Body Blueprint feature, it's not the only way. You can input your information to use the feature manually until you are able to access the machine generated composition data.
I am a Personal Trainer. Can I use SheAPP with my clients?
Yes! As long as you both use SheAPP, you can set up a personal community with individual and group clients. But...since we are HIPAA compliant, only your client can give you access to their MPBB information which is done through our She's It and SheAPP privacy protocol.
How Can I See my 3D image?
If you have participated in a scan, your 3D image will show in the My Personal Body Blueprint feature of SheAPP.
Is SheAPP in the App Store now?
No, SheAPP is currently development going through rigorous testing. We have the agreements and business processes in place so that once SheAPP is ready, you will be able to download directly from the  iTunes, Google Play and Amazon!
Will SheAPP be available around the world ?
Yes. SheAPP will be available around the globe. 
My Company should use this. Is SheAPP available for corporations?
Yes. We have SheAPP Corporate! A full wellness program that provides your employees with an integrated approach to health and wellness. 
Risks and Challenges 

The risks are that the world's women  won't have a chance to recieve this and they will continue to have a fragmented system not contributing to any meaningful 360° well-being! This is your chance to participate in a real-time creation of a fitness/health/wellness SheAPP ""for women by women""! 
Our company will be challenged with creating an infrastructrue to fully support the explosion we are anticipating as women begin to see the real-time benefts of SheAPP!  We are continually seeking the best advice and supports for continual adaptation and support of the SheAPP. 
Other Ways Women Can Help!

We know that not every woman who hears of this and reads the campaign can afford to contribute.  Even for those who can contribute at whatever level, we ask ALL OF YOU with deep appreciation to get the word out to all your friends, family members and colleagues to make some noise about our SheAPP campaign! 
 Please use the Indiegogo share tools found on this site so your enthusiasm will have a direct link to  the SheAPP campaign!

</div><div>Once you have helped fund this App development, you may never know how many people you have personally helped, in so many ways.</div><div>Firstly, the App is for adults and children.

(I am a qualified Yoga/Mindfulness/Meditation teacher with 10 years experience.)</div><div>It will have meditations for children and adults. Meditation regulates the blood pressure, lowers the heart rate and helps with anxiety and depression. (I am a school teacher and a Mum, and I know how anxious our little people get.)</div><div>It will have reminders during the day to access whether you can relax and be more mindful. Being mindful though-out your day creates more space in your life to be fully present and enjoy the life you are living.

</div></div>","Hi friends,I invite you to be part of the next biggest App. We all know we need to relax right? But who has the time?Then if you DO have 5 minutes, what do you do?I'm creating, with your help, an App to cover all your bases. I wish I had this App when my life was crap. I wish I had the daily reminders to take care of my own body before it all crumbled in on itself.Can I tell you a little story about why I want to create this App?This is me.I have had so many stress related stomach operations, the doctors can't operate anymore. I have changed my job, lifestyle and mindset to create a peaceful place in my mind and body, to be relaxed and, mostly, stress-free, thus keeping me out of a hospital and off pain medication. I now help people who have been touched by cancer and their families. Since I have been doing this, I have recognised that stress plays a huge role in recovery and prevention. I don't want to add financial stress to these families, so I have started creating  passive income streams to support my family, so I can go out and help cancer patients and their families at a low cost.Do I have a marketing background? No.Do I have government/corporation support? No.Do I have an awesome team besides me? No.Am I working around making meals, school drop off's and pick up's, homework, cleaning, cooking, self-learning? Yes.So this campaign may not be as professional as some, but it's real. It's just me, sitting at my laptop, listening to my kids watching TV, in my loungeroom, asking for your support.
What is this App?
Once you have helped fund this App development, you may never know how many people you have personally helped, in so many ways.Firstly, the App is for adults and children. It will have simple, easy Yoga stretches that can be done anywhere, even a plane or a desk. Yoga has been scientifically proven to help lower stress levels and is gentle enough that anyone can do it. (I am a qualified Yoga/Mindfulness/Meditation teacher with 10 years experience.)It will have meditations for children and adults. Meditation regulates the blood pressure, lowers the heart rate and helps with anxiety and depression. (I am a school teacher and a Mum, and I know how anxious our little people get.)It will have reminders during the day to access whether you can relax and be more mindful. Being mindful though-out your day creates more space in your life to be fully present and enjoy the life you are living. (When I teach mindfulness to cancer patients, they always say they need a reminder during the day.)It will be continually updated with the latest material available for the next 2 years.What's different about this App?Nowhere else can you download Yoga stretches to do on an airplane to prevent Deep Vein Thrombosis, with an alarm set into the App to remind you to stretch during the flight.Nowhere else can you download Yoga poses created by a Yoga instructor specialising in breast cancer therapy, especially for breast cancer recovery.Nowhere else can you get Yoga poses, meditations, mindfulness alerts, anxiety relief and Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) all in one convenient package.Nowhere else caters for adults AND children in the one App.Nowhere else will you find content designed by an experienced school teacher, a 500 Hr experienced Yoga/meditation/mindfulness teacher, an experienced Yoga specialist for cancer recovery.Why should I support this App?Above is how you will impact through the App, but...Secondly, you will allow me to be able to help more people touched by cancer through my workshops and retreats, online and off. You may never know who you have impacted, but I can guarantee, they will be continually grateful. Your funding will go into the management fees, the development costs, the insurance, any tweaks to make it awesome and user-friendly, and the continual creation of more content. Do I get anything for supporting this App?Have you checked out the perks for your funding yet?I wonder who is going to get to name it and what it's going to be called?If the goal isn't reached, I will make an App that is very basic, until I can raise the funds to make it really awesome. I have changed all of the payments for my digital products to be transferred to here.

<h2>Product Details</h2>
<p>AnyBio is a patent pending wearable device that aggregates data from other sensors wirelessly such as a chest strap or a wearable temperature patch. </p>
<p>AnyBio then combines that data with built in impact and environmental sensors and uploads it to the cloud over built in WIFI or Cellular.</p>
<p>The data is displayed on a single mobile dashboard making it easy for a caregiver to monitor remotely.</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498545730/reaiqctn9obaimdogtpw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>

<p>The cellular version is useful when you want to have a device, which would work both, indoors and outdoors. As long as cellular data coverage is available, and a SIM with cellular data plan is inserted into the SD/SIM tray on AnyBio, AnyBio will be able to upload sensor data to the cloud.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498429367/h8dntl7usybapibhtmrf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In the WIFI version, AnyBio uses WIFI to upload sensor data to the cloud. This version is great for locations where WIFI is available such as indoor arenas, hospitals or large homes. Since you use WIFI to upload sensor data to the cloud, you do not need a data plan with AnyBio.</p>

<h2>Project Timeline</h2>
<p>I started AnyBio in May-2016 with an objective to extend the range of the bluetooth low energy (BLE) based sensors, so I could use a smartphone to monitor my son who plays hockey. Over the next several months, I experimented with various high sensitivity BLE devices but could not achieve my objective. The transmit power of the wearable BLE sensors was very low and BLE sensors at longer distances needed line of sight to work, which is not always practical. In October, 2016, I decided to abandon that approach and decided to create the current version of AnyBio which solves this BLE range issue in addition to allowing multiple BLE sensors to be connected simultaneously.</p>

<p>After the completion of the crowdfunding campaign, I plan integrate the main circuit board with the case, and start working on additional software features as well as native mobile application. In parallel, I will take the  product through FCC compliance.</p>

<p>Funds collected through crowdfunding campaign will be used to support costs for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Main circuit board and case volume production</li>
<li>FCC compliance</li>
<li>Software Feature Development on AnyBio device and cloud.</li>
<li>Native mobile application development for IOS and Android</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>Prototype</h2>
<p>At AnyBio, I have implemented a working prototype of our product.</p>
<ul>
<li>The prototype comprises a number of breakout boards, which implement full functionality of all the sensors built into AnyBio.</li>
<li>I have also fully tested the Bluetooth and cloud interfaces, which are used to collect data from external sensors and then upload this information in real time to the cloud (usually within 1 sec – subject to network delays).</li>
<li>I have implemented a basic web dashboard to collect and display sensor data from the cloud.</li>
<li>I have also designed the production case for AnyBio. A prototype of the case is also shown in the picture below</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498451527/cx7cvyqfnjjipgpbom5z.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>AnyBio can be worn in a number of different ways. You can drop it into your pocket, put it on your arm or mount it on your helmet. </p>

<p>The design of AnyBio went through several iterations before we arrived at the final design.  An early version of AnyBio was produced in a glossy white finish. While aesthetically, glossy white finish did look great, the status LED’s contrast much better with a product with black finish.</p>

<p>I also experimented with building in a wrist heart rate monitor into AnyBio. A breakout board for an optical heart rate monitor, which we integrated with AnyBio, is shown below. What I found is that Optical wrist based heart rate sensors are not as accurate as the heart rate chest strap from companies such as Polar and Garmin. In addition, mounting on wrist does not work for all scenarios especially if you are playing a contact sport.</p>

<p>At AnyBio, I also experimented with using long range Bluetooth technology to extend the range of Bluetooth based sensors. A USB breakout to implement this prototype is pictured above (center). I decided to abandon this approach because most wearable Bluetooth (BLE) sensors transmit at low power to enhance battery life, which really limits the range of these sensors. In addition, at longer distances, BLE requires line of sight for sensors to connect.</p>

<p>I started AnyBio in May 2016 after my son, who plays soccer and ice hockey, fell sick and was diagnosed with a heart condition. While my son was recovering, I wanted to monitor his heart rate and body temperature when he was at school or playing soccer &amp; hockey. While there were individual sensors available, I could not find any product that aggregated multiple sensors, was small/rugged enough to be worn during sports, and could work without a smartphone.</p>

<p>Since I could not find something that worked for me, I decided to create one over the summer. What started as a summer project gradually grew in scope after I got interest on using the product not only to monitor children, but also their elderly parents.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498444873/cuf4kwhsl6tooapzdrwn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p>Prior to AnyBio, I have been at two successful startups where I was one of the first few engineers – Trillium (acquired by Intel for $300M) and Ramp Networks (acquired by Nokia for $127M). I am an electrical engineer with expertise in embedded devices. I have personally designed the hardware and implemented all the software for AnyBio’s sensor aggregator. I am passionate about health and fitness and a proud hockey parent.</p>
<p>At AnyBio, my colleague Don Chin (pictured in the middle of the right pic) is helping me with the launch of our crowdfunding campaign. Don is an accomplished marketer for technology products and also a member of Screen Actor’s Guild (SAG). He has produced hundreds of short films for corporate and philanthropic clients. Like me, he has a long career working in the technology sector for large and small companies in Silicon Valley, and has worked in marketing and operations for several successful startups.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>While I have developed a fully functioning prototype and tested most software that goes on AnyBio, AnyBio venture is still a start up and comes with potential risks and challenges faced by any startup. I will try my best to fulfill rewards that I have promised. I also value transparency above all else and will make sure to always keep my backers up to date on all changes to the estimated timelines. Here are some risks to keep in mind when backing a hardware product venture like AnyBio:</p>
<p><strong>Manufacturing Risks</strong></p>
<p>Although I have substantial experience in manufacturing having worked at the first and the leading contract manufacturer of its time (Solectron), any new product has the potential to have delays. I have tried to account for these delays in the estimated timelines.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Risks</strong></p>
<p>There are likely other small risks and hurdles that I haven't even thought of yet that will be discovered along the way towards fulfilling this project. My main objective is to make this project successful as efficiently as possible and keep everyone in the loop with diligent communication and an open dialogue with my backers.</p>

</div></div>","AnyBio was started to help caregivers get access to biometrics for people in their care (kids, adult parents, athletes).

AnyBio is a Patent pending wearable device
Aggregates data from multiple sensors wirelessly such as a chest strap or a temperature patch. 
Combines data with built in impact & environmental sensors
Uploads data to cloud using WIFI or Cellular


A user (child, elderly parent, athlete) can wear AnyBio on their arm, around their neck or drop it into their pocket
A caregiver can then monitor this user continuously from anywhere.

AnyBio integrates many external sensors using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. In addition, AnyBio has built in impact and environmental sensors. AnyBio allows remote monitoring of the user, by uploading data to the cloud.

User (Child, Elderly Parent, Athlete, Patient) wears AnyBio and other external sensors. He/she does not need to carry a mobile phone.
Caregiver (Parent, Nurse, Coach, Adult Child) can monitor User from anywhere on a mobile dashboard.

AnyBio:

Collects heart rate data wirelessly from a Polar H7/H10 chest strap worn around the chest. Strap purchased separately.
Collects temperature data from a FeverScout temperature patch worn under the arm. FeverScout purchased separately.
Integrates Bluetooth enabled Blood glucose level sensor and additional biometric sensors (to be announced shortly)

 
Uses of AnyBio

AnyBio is great to monitor your child’s body temperature at school. After your child recovers from flu or other illness:

Its good to put a temperature patch on your child in case the fever comes back.
However, temperature patches work with smartphones, which may not be allowed in school.


With AnyBio:

Put on a temperature patch on your child and drop AnyBio into your child’s pocket. AnyBio connects to the patch and provides you temperature reading continuously.
It’s rugged design and built in impact sensor keeps track if your child has suffered a fall.

A short video showing how AnyBio can be used on your child is below:


 


AnyBio is an easy to use device if you would like to monitor your elderly parent. With a smartphone carried by your parent:

Its not always possible to connect to multiple sensors on your body
Smartphones are larger and heavy, and your parent may not always have it on them


With AnyBio, your parent does not need to have a smartphone on him/her. In addition:

Your parent can put multiple sensors such as HR strap and Blood glucose monitor.
AnyBio connects to these sensors and provides you real time readings.
The built in fault detector alerts you if your parent has suffered a fall.

A short video how AnyBio can be used on your parent is shown below:

 

When playing outdoor sports:

Your child/athlete is usually too far from the range of your smartphone
Your child may not be able to carry a smartphone with them because it may break


AnyBio:

Connects to the sensors worn by athlete (such as Heart Rate, Blood glucose)
Sends data to your phone via cloud, no matter how far you are from your athlete
Built in impact sensor alerts you if there is a significant impact to your athlete
Built in environmental sensor allows you to correlate athlete performance with environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity and altitude

Please see a short video on how AnyBio can be used by a soccer parent:

 

When playing sports in a large arena:

Your child/athlete is usually too far from the range of your phone
He/she can’t carry a mobile phone to connect to the sensors with them because the phone may break


AnyBio:

Connects to the sensors worn by athlete (such as Heart Rate, Blood glucose)
Sends data to your phone via cloud, no matter how far you are
Built in impact sensor alerts you if there is a significant impact
Built in environmental sensor allows you to correlate athlete's performance with environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity and altitude

Product Details
AnyBio is a patent pending wearable device that aggregates data from other sensors wirelessly such as a chest strap or a wearable temperature patch. 
AnyBio then combines that data with built in impact and environmental sensors and uploads it to the cloud over built in WIFI or Cellular.
The data is displayed on a single mobile dashboard making it easy for a caregiver to monitor remotely.

 

The cellular version is useful when you want to have a device, which would work both, indoors and outdoors. As long as cellular data coverage is available, and a SIM with cellular data plan is inserted into the SD/SIM tray on AnyBio, AnyBio will be able to upload sensor data to the cloud.
 

In the WIFI version, AnyBio uses WIFI to upload sensor data to the cloud. This version is great for locations where WIFI is available such as indoor arenas, hospitals or large homes. Since you use WIFI to upload sensor data to the cloud, you do not need a data plan with AnyBio.

There are many ways to put on AnyBio. AnyBio has mounting options to use with a lanyard, armband or a belt. In addition, AnyBio can be put into a pocket or a pouch, or put on a helmet using harness or an industrial grade adhesive.

 




AnyBio can be worn with external sensors such as heart rate strap, temperature patch and a blood glucose monitor (coming soon). The below table shows the metrics measured by AnyBio when used with a heart rate strap or a temperature patch.

Looma is the first app for meal planning & prep to work the way you do. There's no information overload or diet rules to follow as you focus on the shopping, cooking, and eating more efficiently and effectively than ever before. Looma prepares grocery lists, perfectly portions recipes for multiple meals, and tracks nutrition automatically. There are never cravings for flavor from starving, dieting, or depriving as you'll discover a variety of recipes that intuitively adapt to your favorite flavors with every swipe and keep the inspiration in your kitchen. 

Powered by Yummly’s recipe engine, Looma contains over 2 million recipes aggregated from across the web and 10 billion+ data points to deliver highly personalized recipes. 

Make a profile in minutes to set your calories and macros according to your current body composition and goals while each recipe follows your dietary preferences, like vegan, gluten-free, or dairy-free.
Discover fresh new options by swiping a selection of recipes, modified to any serving size.
Looma gives recipe directions, personal shopping lists, and tracks calories and macronutrients automatically.

You'll have free time and flexibility with the app that's uncompromisingly designed around helping you prepare meals made just for you. With Looma, it no longer takes the effort to eliminate leftover food waste and eat a variety of healthy foods that match your every expectation. It's never been easier to configure a healthy meal plan; now with just a swipe.

Through the labor of love, bringing Looma to where it is today has been a long and challenging journey. We're in the final stages of development, but now we need your help to bring Looma fully to life.
The money raised on Indiegogo will go directly towards third-party services, expanding our team and contracted expertise, and completion of the app.

Years in the making, and leaving no stone unturned, we have meticulously considered every functional and aesthetic detail of Looma.
Together by interviewing knowledgeable nutritionists, innovative meal preppers, and many self-taught cooks we’ve created a solution that will put an end to all your hesitations about creating your homemade meals. You can trust that your food will be tasteful yet nutritious while you prepare it in no time at all.



We're a team of developers and designers with the goal of inspiring healthy lifestyles through simple design and data-driven personalization. Meeting as students at Michigan Tech, Chetan and Kyle created Looma to make healthy lifestyles more sustainable. Now, Chetan works in Green Bay, Wisconsin after graduating with his computer science degree in 3 years and Kyle will graduate this spring from computer engineering to work in Palo Alto, California.

Take a look at the rewards we provided for you live better and show you've been a part of the journey. Every product order comes with an Indiegogo exclusive 1.94"" x 3"" Looma dye-cut sticker made from durable vinyl and laminate that protects against rain, sunlight, and scratching; perfect for sleek items you carry into the rugged outdoors.

<br/><h1>How Does MyChi Work</h1>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442396810/fqdytxskgl6nlbqdtaxp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>MyChi deploys a synthesis of new and old techniques to help you with 
your diet and sleep.  Upon collecting data from your sleep rhythms, the 
MyChi app analyzes your patterns with the Sleep Quality Model, developed
 over the course of 10 years by the Beijing TCM Research Center, using 
Meridian Organ Clock Theory*.  Combined with other health data, this 
helps the app pinpoint potential weaknesses in your body.  The app can 
then provide optimized Food Therapy, exercise and acupressure 
recommendations to improve organ functioning and re-establish balance 
within your body.  After following these simple suggestions, you can 
expect increased energy, improved sleep, and overall better health.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>*Meridian Organ Clock Theory </b>is used in acupuncture practice. 
Some people call it the Body Clock system. It’s a natural law that 
models the movement of energy patterns, qi flow and blood flow, 
throughout body.  According to Traditional Chinese Medicine practices, 
within each 24 hour cycle, each 2 hour period is related to an organ 
network. From 1am to 3am, for example, is connected to the liver organ 
network. If you always wake up (or don’t sleep) during this period of 
time, it indicates that your liver network is in need of adjustment.  
This theory is used for both diagnosis and treatment of organ network 
weakness in TCM.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest challenge we face in bringing this product to 
market is communicating the principles and benefits of Traditional 
Chinese Food Therapy to consumers who are new to these concepts. To 
tackle this challenge, we integrated TCFT with Western nutrition 
standards, included many Western foods and recipes, and developed 
intuitive, user-friendly meal plans and tips. </p>
<p>We are driven by a desire to introduce these simple benefits to a 
larger audience.  We believe the market is mature and looking for 
integrative health solutions.  It is both a challenge and a unique 
opportunity to pioneer the integration of ancient Eastern wisdom with 
modern Western science in personal consumer health technology.  <br/></p>

<p><b style=""font-size: 36px; letter-spacing: 1px;"">About Traditional Chinese Food Therapy and Our Story<br/></b></p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Food therapy, or TCFT, is a holistic philosophy 
system with ancient roots in China.  Sharing many aspects with 
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), it has benefitted Chinese people for
 thousands of years. TCFT is a holistic system of selecting the best 
nourishment for your body based on your specific body type and 
condition, the attributes of specific foods and seasonings, and matching
 those with seasonal factors.  TCFT assesses and combines this diverse 
range of variables to design a regimen that supports the immune system, 
aides sleep and digestion, and helps you maintain a healthy weight in 
harmony with your body’s natural rhythms.</p>
<p>MyChi is a convenient tool that transforms the intricate process of 
living according to TCFT principles, into something that’s easy and fun 
for you to use. It’s like having your own dedicated holistic life coach 
trained to understand your body’s needs and working to give you tailored
 advice, every day, right from your smart phone!</p>
<p>Our team became interested in developing the MyChi system after 
experiencing the dramatic impact that Traditional Chinese Food Therapy 
had in our own lives.</p>
<p>Sophia Ma (the founder) happily became a mother in 2012.  During her 
recuperation period, Sophia closely designed her recovery regimen 
according to TCFT.  She was amazed at her speedy recovery and quickly 
regained the strength she needed to meet the demands of motherhood.</p>
<p>Inspired by her own experience, she decided she had to find a way to 
share the powerful principles of TCFT with a larger audience.</p>
<p>Anna Na (co-founder) encountered serious health problems brought on 
by the stresses of her busy professional lifestyle eight years ago.  
After a series of attempted and failed remedies, she healed with the 
help of Traditional Chinese Medicine which kicked off her deep and 
lasting engagement with Traditional Chinese Food Therapy and its 
applications. </p>
<p>While only a qualified doctor can treat with herbal medicines and 
other TCM techniques, with the right knowledge and tools, it is possible
 for anyone to apply the principles of TCFT to their daily lives.</p>

</div>
<p>Holistic design is the guiding principle of the MyChi, in both hardware and software.  A big advantage of MyChi above most other modern personal assessment tools is that the MyChi system does not just deliver cold hard data without analysis, but instead offers simple and actionable holistic advice that has the potential to transform your health.  The design of the MyChi Pebble is inspired by traditional elements of Chinese health culture, jade and BianShi, for a natural, ergonomic feel.  Jade calms the mind for sleep, and Bianshi is a wellness tool widely used in ancient China.  Its design reflects Traditional Chinese Medicine’s concept of the harmonic balance between human and nature.</p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px;"">Who is Mychi for?</span></p>
<p>MyChi is a holistic personal smart assistant suitable for those who seek balance within their bodies through increasing mindfulness of what they consume, how they sleep, and how they live day-to-day according to TCFT teachings.<br/>
According to World Health Organization (WHO), one-third of the world’s people suffer sleep problems. Sleeplessness has many nebulous effects which could include emotional problems, depression, anxiety, and tension, and may cause hypertension and diabetes. People with sleep problems are at 2-3 times greater risk of heart disease than people who sleep <span>well</span>. Those who suffer chronic sleep loss (insomnia) tend to have a shorter lifespan.</p>
<p>Many people don’t realize that their mental and physical issues are caused by insufficient sleep or low quality sleep. And they don’t realize they can improve sleep by eating the right foods and making small changes in their daily lives. MyChi makes these connections for you, making it simple to live a better life!</p>

<p><b>About MyChi Pebble</b><br/></p>
<div>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<span></span><b>What does the MyChi Pebble look like?
</b>
</li></ul>
<p><span></span>The MyChi Pebble is very beautiful and about the size of a large coin, like a piece of jade. It took two years for the top designers to complete it. The outside shape references Bian Shi, a special thin stone that was used as scraping tool in ancient Chinese medicine treatment. Combined with a modern design, the device looks like a piece of art.
</p>
<ul><li>
<span></span><b>What about the quality of the MyChi Pebble?</b>
</li></ul>The important part of the MyChi Pebble is the inside sensor. The sensor chip is made by the top manufacturer in China and they have a solid track record of experience with many widely sold, well-known smart devices.<br/><br/><ul><li><b>Can two people or a family use one MyChi?
</b></li></ul>
<span></span>No. To make the data accurate, one MyChi system is needed for each individual.<br/><br/><ul><li>
<span></span><b>How often do I need to change the battery?
</b>
</li></ul>
<span></span>You do not need to change the battery. The internal battery will last approximately 12 months. At that time, you will be able to return the device in exchange for a new one at a discounted rate. <br/><br/><b>About Delivery</b><br/><br/><ul><li><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></li></ul>
<br/>It's US$129 per MyChi system, but you can get it at about 50% discount during Indiegogo campaign. <br/><br/><ul><li><strong>When will you deliver the product?</strong></li></ul>
We plan to deliver our first batch of products in April, 2016.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>About MyChi App
</b><br/><b><br/></b><ul><li>
<b>Is the app available for Android and iPhone?</b>
</li></ul>The App will be available for iPhone only after completion of our Indiegogo campaign. In the future, we will work to develop an Android app as well.<br/>
<br/><ul><li><b>What if I’m a Gluten-free or a vegetarian user?</b></li></ul>
<br/>We plan to develop a separate version for vegetarian and gluten free users later.
<br/>
<br/>However, if you are a vegetarian and want to use the earlier MyChi version, you can replace meat with vegetarian food. The foods recommended are whole foods with high nutritional value. Meat is only a small part of the meal plan. <br/>
<br/><ul><li><b>What if I have special nutritional needs or allergies? (allergies, restricted diet, medical condition)</b></li></ul>
<br/>All foods recommended in the MyChi app are real healthy whole foods that provide optimal health and are especially useful for people with many medical conditions. You can also eliminate/substitute foods if you have specific allergies. However, you should consult your physician or dietitian before following the MyChi app’s advice.<br/>
<br/><ul><li><b>Will all the foods be available to me in my local supermarket?</b></li></ul>
<br/>Most foods will be available in local supermarkets or local Asian shops. For special foods such as dried black fungus, we have a link guide to online shops such as amazon.com.<br/>
<br/><ul><li><b>Does the app recommend snacks as well as meals? </b></li></ul>
<br/>Yes, the app recommends the full meal plan for a whole day including snack and drinks. One day’s menu includes drinks, breakfast, morning snack, lunch, afternoon snack, and dinner. Most snacks recommended are fruits and vegetables.<br/>
<br/><ul><li><b>What type of time does it take to cook/prepare the meals?</b></li></ul>
<br/>Most of the foods take less than 30 minutes to prepare. A few therapeutic foods such as congee and soup will take longer, although they’re simple to prepare. 
<br/>
<br/>You can find most of the lunch foods easily in restaurants, making it convenient for busy working people.<br/>
<br/><ul><li><b>I get treatment from a TCM doctor (or get acupuncture). How does this work with the treatment I am receiving?</b></li></ul>
<br/>Chinese Food Therapy is complementary to other TCM treatment. However, you should consult your TCM doctor before following MyChi’s advice.<br/>

How Does MyChi Work


MyChi deploys a synthesis of new and old techniques to help you with 
your diet and sleep.  Upon collecting data from your sleep rhythms, the 
MyChi app analyzes your patterns with the Sleep Quality Model, developed
 over the course of 10 years by the Beijing TCM Research Center, using 
Meridian Organ Clock Theory*.  Combined with other health data, this 
helps the app pinpoint potential weaknesses in your body.  The app can 
then provide optimized Food Therapy, exercise and acupressure 
recommendations to improve organ functioning and re-establish balance 
within your body.  After following these simple suggestions, you can 
expect increased energy, improved sleep, and overall better health.

*Meridian Organ Clock Theory is used in acupuncture practice. 
Some people call it the Body Clock system. It’s a natural law that 
models the movement of energy patterns, qi flow and blood flow, 
throughout body.  According to Traditional Chinese Medicine practices, 
within each 24 hour cycle, each 2 hour period is related to an organ 
network. From 1am to 3am, for example, is connected to the liver organ 
network. If you always wake up (or don’t sleep) during this period of 
time, it indicates that your liver network is in need of adjustment.  
This theory is used for both diagnosis and treatment of organ network 
weakness in TCM.


Perks











Risks and Challenge
Perhaps the biggest challenge we face in bringing this product to 
market is communicating the principles and benefits of Traditional 
Chinese Food Therapy to consumers who are new to these concepts. To 
tackle this challenge, we integrated TCFT with Western nutrition 
standards, included many Western foods and recipes, and developed 
intuitive, user-friendly meal plans and tips. 
We are driven by a desire to introduce these simple benefits to a 
larger audience.  We believe the market is mature and looking for 
integrative health solutions.  It is both a challenge and a unique 
opportunity to pioneer the integration of ancient Eastern wisdom with 
modern Western science in personal consumer health technology.

We recently expanded our program to include canned and boxed foods through the Premium Product Program of Feeding America and we would like to significantly <b>expand our</b> <b>community outreach</b> with other fresh food products. To accomplish this expansion we need to do some renovation of our existing building to include at least 2-3 freezers, 2-3 more refrigerators, locking doors in the food storage area, repainting, a monitored security system that covers the food storage area and the church, add additional storage facilities and any additional upgrades to meet current building codes. We are planning extensive marketing into the community about our food/pantry programs - in part through the ""Every Door"" program available through the Postal Service and in addition through mailings completed through the use of ""Amazing Mail"" that works along with the U.S. Postal System.  The ""more expansive"" program available through Feeding America, <b>requires </b>many of these upgrades and we are presently on their list for this more complete program when it becomes available to us and when we have fully met the requirements.<br/></p><p>     Note: Our Diocese has also given us some seed money (Oct. 17) in the amount of $3,000.

We started with a program through Gospel Food Ministries to supply needy families with quality foods one time per month. We added a program where we pick up donated bread and pastry items 2 days per week. We recently expanded our program to include canned and boxed foods through the Premium Product Program of Feeding America and we would like to significantly expand our community outreach with other fresh food products. To accomplish this expansion we need to do some renovation of our existing building to include at least 2-3 freezers, 2-3 more refrigerators, locking doors in the food storage area, repainting, a monitored security system that covers the food storage area and the church, add additional storage facilities and any additional upgrades to meet current building codes. We are planning extensive marketing into the community about our food/pantry programs - in part through the ""Every Door"" program available through the Postal Service and in addition through mailings completed through the use of ""Amazing Mail"" that works along with the U.S. Postal System.  The ""more expansive"" program available through Feeding America, requires many of these upgrades and we are presently on their list for this more complete program when it becomes available to us and when we have fully met the requirements.     Note: Our Diocese has also given us some seed money (Oct. 17) in the amount of $3,000. This demonstrates support toward our goal and it also demonstrates to potential donors that there is support from our own Christian Fellowship.     Some of the money collected will be used to purchase the CD (Perk), mailing fees and any other related fees. A CD (Ben Pila -Commemoration) will be given away as a perk to those donating $60.00 or more. We are extremely fortunate to be able to offer this CD which is already produced by Ben Pila, the classical guitarist that just recently played for the Pope during his visit to the United States .     We are also planning to work with Ben in the production of a Classical Guitar Christmas CD that will be available next year. Although there was not enough time to get that CD produced for this campaign, it will be available next year in advance of the Christmas Holiday. Those donating $100.00 or more will get that CD next year. before December 10th along with the CD that he has available now.  The CD available now will be shipped at the conclusion of this campaign to those contributing $60. Some of the funds collected will be used to make the Classical Christmas Holiday CD for next year.      We will use one of the best recording studios in the country and one of the best CD production services and one of the best CD production and mastering services available.     We will also use a local independent certified accountant to track all money received and how all funds are spent.

OUR FEMALE ATHLETES ARE JUST AS SERIOUS AND DEDICATED AS OUR GUYS. WE DO NOT COMPROMISE ON ANY FEATURE OR BENEFIT IN REGARDS TO FIT, FABRICS, FUNCTION AND FORM. OUR FEMININE STYLING WILL ENHANCE THE MODERN LOOK OF TRAINING.WOMEN'S EXCEED TECH TOPThis short sleeve top is actually a half sleeve. The sleeves are intentionally longer with gentle compression to provide more muscle support for the upper arm. Along with the princess seams, this top offers contemporary feminine styling.WOMEN'S EXCEED TANKTo complement the Half Sleeve, the racer back Tank allows for non-constricted movement while doing an array of exercises. The back design provides comfort and won’t interfere with bench pressing and floor work. 

WOMENS EXCEL LONG SLEEVE TOP

Following the same formula as Men’s, this too has highly advanced thermoregulation, and there’s nothing better than an engineered system. We’re using our “sweat map” knowledge to engineer a mesh in the back panel to vent your body heat where it’s most needed, keeping you comfortable and dry.

WOMEN'S EXCEED CAPRI PANT

Let’s not confuse this with a standard yoga capri. This is a serious training pant as the capri length applies gentle, yet effective compression to the primary leg muscles, thus creating a more optimal environment for unhindered performance. 
WOMEN'S BIKER SHORT

The Biker Short is a go-to short for the girl who wants compression and support, while doing the most intense activities. The shaped panels and soft-hand fabric provide unparalleled comfort. This short is perfect whether you’re hitting the gym, hot yoga, or going for a long run.

WOMEN'S EXCEED RUN SHORT

This short is great for running, but also functions extremely well in the gym. The higher knit waistband helps it sit in all the right places. The vented pockets look great, while keep you cool and dry during the most intense sessions.
WOMEN'S EXCEED TECH HOODY

This form-fitting hoody has a soft, beautiful textured fabric and was designed for an array of outdoor activities. It’s paneled in a way to flatter the female build but still provides superior function whether you’re running on the trails or doing outdoor training club.",23.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Penny has been approached by Sense Scotland to deliver 1-1 yoga sessions for individuals with sensory impairments and she is increasingly being asked to take on more students.  People who are deaf or blind or have sensory integration differences as part of autism spectrum disorders, cannot access traditional methods or spaces of yoga.

<p>Morgan and Penny work together in an integrated partnership, supporting each other to deliver, practice and consider our contribution to the wellbeing of our students and our community.  We both have academic backgrounds and will endeavour to work in partnership with research institutes to contribute to and the growing evidence base for yoga in relation to health and wellbeing of the individual and the community.   Our particular research interests are autism and eating disorders.  We are in dialogue with international institutions with whom we aim to work in partnership with.   </p>

JUST PLUG IT INTO YOUR SMART PHONE OR PC AND GET AN INSTANT CONSULTATION VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE.
Check your heart from anywhere in the world using our new and revolutionary, miniature, portable Electrocardiograph (ECG) through our network of certified cardiology experts, all from your Smart Phone or PC.



Use for regular monitoring without extensive hassle and time loss from making and keeping appointments, use the HeartIn Portable Electrocardiograph for peace of mind, or for times of distress, all for the ultimate in prompt safety, security, and speedy diagnosis.



We use a network of cardiology consultants we certify to instantly interpret and read results from all the necessary cardio ECG data right after you send it.




WHAT COULD BE SIMPLER? 
From the time you or a loved one start the process of applying the HeartIn ECG’s leads to your body to the time you send data to our examining and consulting cardiologist takes usually no more than 15 minutes for a first time user.  We supply an easy-to-read application chart to attach leads, the leads are coded to eliminate confusion, and electrodes attached to your body are adhesive at their ends for ease of personal application.  The examining cardiologist can verify correct placement or answer any uncertainties during the consultation.

 

ULTIMATE PEACE OF MIND
Interpretation and Cardiologist’s Advice Follows Almost Immediately!!!!
You will get peace of mind in minutes, and even an instant start on necessary treatment if indicated!
All that from the comfort of your home, office, car, the road, hotel, or wherever in the world you and your smartphone or PC can connect to the Internet.  We supply the app on free download.
NO WONDER WE CALL IT A REVOLUTION!
The HeartIn ECG is no larger than a cigarette pack (exclusive of leads) and produces the same data produced by a full-size electrocardiograph that may require a shelf or cart in a doctor’s office, clinic or hospital.


It’s a full 12-lead device with all the data any cardiologist needs to conduct a full evaluation – not a condensed or truncated device -- yet its cost is highly affordable.  At a price of just $240, the average person can buy a HeartIn ECG for less money than the typical smartphone, with no subscription costs!  Use it only when you want or need to, and pay for only those consultations you request.




This amazingly small but full-function ECG will fit in a man’s shirt pocket, and the entire setup with leads will fit in small woman’s bag or package (supplied free).
Whether you need it if you’re in distress, to evaluate worrisome signs or just periodic monitoring for compliance results with your treating doctor’s orders, this is the device for you.
Use it on the road, from home, or anywhere. 

WE PROVIDE ALSO HIGH-LEVEL ANALYSIS OF ECG DATA
Benefits of Additional Cardio Data Analysis Technology:
Universal ECG Score System
- CardioanalysisUniversal ECG Score System is designed to analyse more than 200 ECG parameters and to visualize present result in colour logic with a quantitative assessment. 
- The system is able to provide qualified interpretation of ECG signals remaining non–informative for routine methods of ECG interpretation.
Individualized analysis 
- The concept of individual norms for everyone based on Universal ECG Score System allows enhancing the accuracy of results and to individualize recommendations.
Comprehensive statistic engine and Fuzzy logic 
- We use advanced statistical treatment of ECG signals including fuzzy measure theory and fuzzy integral calculus which allows making the precise conclusion.
- 4-th generation ECG analysis technologies. Thorough and deep analysis being obtained under this technology are impossible to receive through ECG visual analysis; 
- Usage of specific ECG parameters that never been used before (our know-how in T-wave analysis)
- Cardiovascular system condition trends assessment makes possible for a doctor to manage the treatment process.
Cloud computing 
- We enable users, their caretakers, and doctors to receive results promptly anywhere and at any time.

There’s no excuse not to have your own personal HEART-IN ECG.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello Indiegogo Community, </p>
<p>We are the team at FITFIT.LIFE and we want to share with you
an exciting concept that is going to revolutionize the way we continue our
workout regiments away from the gym and how they are utilized on fitness apps!
Indiegogo Community we introduce to you FITFIT.LIFE!</p>
<p>We at FITFIT.LIFE are a compassionate group of individuals
just like “YOU” who want to stay active, in shape, and live a productive
healthy lifestyle. We would like to
spend six days a week in the gym under the tutelage of a trainer, but with a
hectic life and a full schedule sometimes we just can’t make that happen. With
this app, you can achieve the same impactful trainer driven workout after you
leave your trainer. We at FITFIT.LIFE
are also trainers who want to be able to provide shared- knowledge and
expertise that we have gained over a lifetime in the fitness industry. We want
to share it with “EVERYONE” and “EVERYWHERE.” Not just a hand few of clients
who have the financial means and luxury of time to commit to the gym four to
five days a week. </p>
<p>Indiegogo Community, FITFIT.LIFE is an interactive mobile
fitness lifestyle app that you can take anywhere and apply your custom workout
regimen from a list of a 1,000 certified training exercises from the touch of a
button!  If desired, the FITFIT.LIFE app
will auto populate a daily workout regimen for you by simply imputing your
desired workout length, area of focus (weight loss, tone muscle, gain mass),
and level of difficulty based on your training skill-set; it’s as simple as
1-2-3! The FITFIT.LIFE app is also voice and video animated so you at home can
take the same experience of working out with a trainer in the gym on your smart
device! Who knows, your favorite trainer might actually be one of the selected
1,000 trainers who would have access to load their personal training exercises on
our app and provide it to the at home user. How unique is that! Indiegogo
Community, with your support we can bring this level of fitness innovation to
everyone, everywhere, with minimal out of pocket cost to you! It does little
justice to us keeping our elite training exercises to the select few when all
can enjoy the experience. Help us share that vision!</p>
<p>Indiegogo Community, we are looking for $50,000 to make this
dream of providing the first-ever interactive workout lifestyle app possible.
By reaching our funding goal, the money use will go towards the final
completion of the app demonstrating all the said applications mentioned above.
The funding will also allow us to market to other highly-skilled trainers who
want to promote themselves and their training methods to a broader audience
base. </p>
<p>Indiegogo Community, we have some awesome perks we are
offering for those that contribute to our cause. The cost of participating as a
member of the FITFIT.LIFE community in any giving level could be as little as
the cost of a Grande cup at Starbucks to a percentage of a monthly gym
membership for an entire year of service! Where are you going to find a better deal than
that?</p>
<p><b>$6.00 – Try Me! –
Offers you six-month trial of our service.</b></p>
<p><b>$10.00 – Try Me For A
Year! – Offers you a year worth of service.</b></p>
<p><b>$25.00 – You Plus
Two! – Offers you plus two guests our service for a year.</b></p>
<p><b>$100.00 – Party of
Five Live at BIGFIT – Offers you plus four guests our dynamic fitness product
for an entire calendar year of service plus two “free” tickets to our live
BIGFIT group training session premier party!</b></p>
<p><b>Or there is an option
to donate what you can for the cause! JUST DONATE :)</b><b>.
If you don’t have the means to donate help us get the word out and get others
to contribute to our campaign! Please access our FITIFIT.LIFE social-media
links to share with others :). </b></p>
<p>In closing Indiegogo Community, this app will change how
fitness is brought to the masses! We are a global society. Trainers want to be
able to provide their knowledge and gain exposure without having to be confined
to the stringent non-compete rules of a brick and mortar facility.  Let’s break the bondage Indiegogo Community! Help
us create the perfect learning and training environment for our clients and utopian
conditions for trainer. If we achieve our plight, then the money accumulated
will go towards achieving our goal of creating an on-line community for
trainers to provide share-knowledge and access more people world-wide! The team
at FITFIT.LIFE appreciates you taking the time to read our story and hopefully
it inspires you to give generously towards our cause. </p>

I'm a transgender FtM Preop male and i'm currently on fixed income and most of the money goes to my parents to either pay bills or for them to use on things we don't really need.  My mother is very trans phobic toward me and my changes and is very abusive about it. <p></p><p>My parents in general are very manipulative and abusive as well and the stress and anxiety are causing problems with day to day life along with my general health. </p><p></p><p>Currently they will not allow me to get a bank account, use my social security number, get a drivers license or use my food stamps for my own self. I only get $16 in food stamps according to Arkansas law because I am on fixed income. </p><p></p><p>I am unable to go to the doctor when I need to because of this. </p><p></p><p>What I hope to achieve with this campaign is to be able to move out, get my name and gender marker changed on my ID and move into an income based apartment with friends where I will be safe and taken care of. Along with being able to afford doctors visits, Therapist visits and a few other medical expenses.</p><p><br/></p><p>In an effort to help encourage donations I will be offering perks to those who donate !  I'll be updating this area later to show examples of these perks as well so stay tuned for that. </p><p><br/></p><h1>Why</h1><div><br/></div><div>Currently including the above information I'm unable to hold a job due to my poor health which is why I am on fixed income. Which means I am unable to afford being able to move out to a safer home. With this campaign I hope to be able to move to be with close friends where I can get the medical help I need along with proper care. I will be taking my pets with me as well. </div><div><br/></div><div>Thanks to my parents i'm unable to really do much except for lay in bed all day and get yelled at for being ""lazy"" even though I have diagnosed chronic depression and anxiety along with Border line personality Disorder, Autism, Manic Depressive and bipolar. <br/><br/>My physical ailments include Rheumatoid Arthritis, Thyroid Disease, Gerd/Acid Reflux and chest pains. I am on expensive medication to help deal with these issues but currently i'm unable to get to a doctor when I need to or a therapist/psychiatrist to get my medication adjusted properly when it needs to be. On top of that my medication is very expensive and cost over 100 usd a month. I can barely afford this. <br/><br/>I am also unable to afford going to a gender therapist to start my transition and i'm unable to afford male clothes and chest binders. I also need to be able to legally get my name changed as well. So far this process is near impossible unless I'm able to move away from my family and get funding from outside sources like this fundraiser. Any amount helps ! </div><h2>Goals</h2><div>Through this campaign here is a small list of goals I hope to be able to obtain.</div><div><br/></div><div><ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Get a legal name change to help my transition</span><br/>

</div></div>","An IntroductionHello my name is Spencer and i'm currently raising funds to move out of an abusive house hold. I'm a transgender FtM Preop male and i'm currently on fixed income and most of the money goes to my parents to either pay bills or for them to use on things we don't really need.  My mother is very trans phobic toward me and my changes and is very abusive about it. My parents in general are very manipulative and abusive as well and the stress and anxiety are causing problems with day to day life along with my general health. Currently they will not allow me to get a bank account, use my social security number, get a drivers license or use my food stamps for my own self. I only get $16 in food stamps according to Arkansas law because I am on fixed income. I am unable to go to the doctor when I need to because of this. What I hope to achieve with this campaign is to be able to move out, get my name and gender marker changed on my ID and move into an income based apartment with friends where I will be safe and taken care of. Along with being able to afford doctors visits, Therapist visits and a few other medical expenses.In an effort to help encourage donations I will be offering perks to those who donate !  I'll be updating this area later to show examples of these perks as well so stay tuned for that. WhyCurrently including the above information I'm unable to hold a job due to my poor health which is why I am on fixed income. Which means I am unable to afford being able to move out to a safer home. With this campaign I hope to be able to move to be with close friends where I can get the medical help I need along with proper care. I will be taking my pets with me as well. Thanks to my parents i'm unable to really do much except for lay in bed all day and get yelled at for being ""lazy"" even though I have diagnosed chronic depression and anxiety along with Border line personality Disorder, Autism, Manic Depressive and bipolar. My physical ailments include Rheumatoid Arthritis, Thyroid Disease, Gerd/Acid Reflux and chest pains. I am on expensive medication to help deal with these issues but currently i'm unable to get to a doctor when I need to or a therapist/psychiatrist to get my medication adjusted properly when it needs to be. On top of that my medication is very expensive and cost over 100 usd a month. I can barely afford this. I am also unable to afford going to a gender therapist to start my transition and i'm unable to afford male clothes and chest binders. I also need to be able to legally get my name changed as well. So far this process is near impossible unless I'm able to move away from my family and get funding from outside sources like this fundraiser. Any amount helps ! GoalsThrough this campaign here is a small list of goals I hope to be able to obtain.

Get a legal name change to help my transition


Be able to mail my things to my new home


Buy a plane Ticket


Pay for medical bills/medical costs


Pay for vet bills/medical costs for my cat and dog

Afford new medical devices like braces for my wrists, elbow and knees along with a back brace. 
Pay for my medication 
Start going to a gender therapist
Afford new chest binders and male clothing
Get rest of teeth removed and get Dentures
Rewards InformationAfter the funding period ends donators will be messaged so they may choose their tier rewards and then within that time period rewards will began to be sent out.  If you've donated previously and would like to donate again and want your reward tier raised please contact us and we can do that for you ! Update #1 Here are some of the perks you can earn.  These show every option you can choose from and will be updated ! Please let me know which one you'd like depending on the tier you've donated to.  The art was made by me and  Nursetiger or one of the members of our webshop WikiTronics ! Update #2 New Tier added, more rewards added to tiers Sticker Tier

Pizza-Pasta-Catering has accomplished the following:<br/>
<br/>
-Winner of ""Best Pizza in Elk Grove Village

-Over 2300 likes on Facebook<br/>
- (90) ""5 star"" reviews between

-Only local pizzeria to reward customers for

<br/>
Cooking is my passion!! I treat EVERY customer
that comes through the door like FAMILY!! They matter to me. I dont send out
product unless its perfect!! NO EXCEPTIONS!! I practice ""old school""
customer service, like opening the door for a customer as they leave, greating
every customer that enters our door with ""welcome to Doughboy's!!"" ,
Calling customers to ask how thier food was, responding to EVERY review.<br/>
<br/>
The help I need is ""working capital.""
I had $30,000 set aside to cover operating expenses, however after purchasing
the business, the Village of Elk Grove came in and forced me to update
electrical, plumbing, gas, sewer and water lines. These were not expenses that
I budgeted for!! Especially since the site was formally a pizzeria and the
business itself is in a Strip Mall  and the landlord at the time told me
he would not pay for the updates because he was selling the building.  I
went back to the village and pleaded with them, hoever they said if I didnt
make the updates that they wouldnt allow me to open. So I was forced to dump
all of my savings into a ""building I didn't own,"" which then set my
opening date back 5 weeks. Once i did open I was confident that the marketing
plan I developed would balance out the HUGE expenses, however my location is
slightly hidden off the main road and sales are only at half of what I projected.<br/>
<br/>
I am trying everything I can think of  to
stay alive!!<br/>
I have cut expenses, cut staff, have my
operating budget down to a bare minimum, I even am sleeping at the pizzeria

<p><b>History and Goal of the PROTXS Indiegogo Campaign:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Dr. Michael Halliday, DC, founded
PROTXS. Dr. Halliday sought to expand his work on total health. During this
research he uncovered the amount of data that was available on electromagnetic
radiation and its affects on people.
This new concern–electromagnetic radiation–and its effects on health,
especially for children, was alarming. This set him on a new journey of
understanding and then being a leader in the new field of Energy Medicine. He has
sought out and worked with scientific leaders in this field to understand the
effects of EMR and to develop products to mitigate the affects. This work has
lead to the development of PROTXS.</p><p><b>Current Research:</b></p>

- “97/104 subjects showed moderate  positive/very positive reaction
to EMF/Wi-Fi radiation when  PROTXS technology
was carried by the test subjects. The tests  were conducted
by double blind method to assure non-biased  response.
Ms. Kate Snyder (graduate of Calvin College with a Masters in

PROTXS is the only device, out of the six competitive devices she tested, that: A) protects the human bio-field from EMF radiation when talking on a cell phone, and B) restores and improves both Blood Brain Barrier scores and Heart Rate Variability scores when used.

Blood Brain Barrier (BBB):  There is a concern over the integrity of the BBB exposed to EMF (there are numerous articles on this subject, a sample of one study is by Dr. Leif Salford: Electromagnetic Fields and Leakage of the Blood Brain Barrier). PROTXS' BBB integrity tests were performed using a CyberScan device.
The CyberScan is an advanced biofeedback device from Germany that is a CE Class
II Therapy device approved by the FDA. The tests show a composite of Subjects
who were measured at four test points: 1) Base Line; 2) holding an active cell
phone at their head for one minute; 3) holding an active cell phone to their

<ul> <li>In 2013, I went through treatment for Breast Cancer. I understand that world and I've witnessed first hand<i> how the process of going through treatment could be greatly improved. </i>I have complete empathy for those who have to go through it, those who have gone through it and those contemplating prophylactic measures.</li>
<li>The challenge for me during treatment was to improve the conversation around the reconstruction of my body. I was going to lose my breasts, which was something that was never on my radar. When women have mastectomies, they lose their nipples as well. Talking about the surgical direction with hand gestures, photo examples showing the results on other women's bodies, or 3-D graphic illustrations of an average female form was fine at the time while I was trying to comprehend having cancer, but in the back of my mind, I still felt that I was in the dark about what I was going to actually look like in the end. I knew that I would have scars but I wasn't sure how many or how big they would be. I wanted to see visual references of future results on my own body and wondered why something like this wasn't already in place in the age of technology and digital photography.</li>
<li>In the world of advertising, before a creative agency can sell a commercial, they must show the client with frame by frame references what their commercial is going to look like so that they know what the creative agency will be producing. From camera angle, to the style of lighting, to what the actors are wearing, how their product will be featured, even the style of the actors hair and so on. There are many subtleties in the aesthetic choices that go into the creation of a commercial and as a creative professional, you have to represent everything that you plan to create visually to your client because they may have something completely different in their mind. You have to be on the same page with your client because they are the ones paying for the commercial. This is called Previsualization, and in the advertising and film business it's called a <i>Pre-viz</i>. </li>
<li>Previsualizing a commercial staves off any future disappointment and puts you on the same page with your client. Happy client. Happy business, right? If I were ever to explain a commercial to a client with hand gestures or pictures of another commercial that's similar, I know for a fact that I would not get the job.</li>
<li>That's how I treated the reconstruction of my body. I imported the idea of previsualization into the world of Breast Cancer reconstruction. I wanted to know what I was going to look like during and after several months of surgeries. Even though I had a very talented plastic surgeon, I still needed visual references for myself that represented my own body. This helped me to keep my expectations in check and cross reference with my doctor about the surgical goals.</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">My campaign is two pronged. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>First</b>, women don't know that they can ask for this type of service because it has never been offered before, and to be honest, ridding oneself of cancer is always the primary haunting concern. Most of us think: <i>if I make it out of here alive, I will be grateful. </i>New boobs and a tummy tuck can be viewed as perk, but being free from cancer is the goal.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">I will generate an <b>Awareness Campaign </b>in tandem to the launch of the beta test for my <i>Breast Cancer Previsualization App. </i>I want women to know that they need to ask for this type of service and to raise the question, <i>Why isn't something like this in place already? </i></span>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">My Breast Cancer Previsualization App is a tool that will allow women to view the surgical plan on their own body while sharing the same perspective as their surgeon. And this too puts them both on the same page.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Every Breast Cancer diagnosis and every surgical procedure is different. Just as every woman’s body type is different and how they'll heal is different. There are many variations of results.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Raising awareness is paramount to the launch of this app because currently, the norm is that women go into surgery with very little information. They go into surgery in the dark, holding onto the belief in their doctor's skill set, that they will come out like one of their best case scenarios.</span>
</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I was quite fortunate to have excellent results as I have seen far too many horrific results in private Breast Cancer community chat forums that were just completely heartbreaking. I consider myself very fortunate to have gone through treatment for Breast Cancer in the age of technology and facebook. Eight years ago, how could women measure their results or even know about the different options available for reconstruction? Or who the quality surgeons were? I want to change that. I want to empower those going through treatment for Breast Cancer by giving them incredible tools so that will know that they are on the same page with their surgeon, in effort to stave off disappointing surprises. I want to give them peace of mind, a sense of control when there is very little control. I want to educate them so that they can improve the conversation with their surgeons around their own reconstruction. They will know what they will look like on the other side of surgery.</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Second</b>, Research and Development of <i>The Breast Cancer Previsualization App. </i>I will create a beta test of this app which will allow me to work with <b>25 Breast Cancer patients anywhere in the United States.</b> This app will be highly secure which will comply with medical clearances and an incredibly powerful tool with a user friendly interface.</span>
</li> <li>My vision which takes on improving the world of Breast Cancer is a massive undertaking. No one likes talking or hearing about cancer, as no one likes being reminded of their mortality. Having to skirt the medical iron curtain in effort to give the medical community an innovate tool seems counter productive. One would think that they should want to take the lead of being innovators in medicine, but perhaps it's a far too complicated notion to take on. So now the patients will show the medical community the importance of this tool. <b style=""background-color: initial;"">Power To The Patient.</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> I believe that they will prove the demand that a tool like this must exist in the world of surgical reconstruction.

Breast Cancer Previsualization is an app plus a service which gives those going through reconstruction for Breast Cancer a powerful tool to improve the conversation with their doctors.

My Breast Cancer Previsualization App is a tool that will allow women to view the surgical plan on their own body while sharing the same perspective as their surgeon. And this too puts them both on the same page.


Every Breast Cancer diagnosis and every surgical procedure is different. Just as every woman’s body type is different and how they'll heal is different. There are many variations of results.

<div>As a backer of my campaign, it will be my honor and pleasure to offer the PlusOne's PreShave/PostShave paired system as a pre-order Perk. These initial offerings of the PlusOne Grooming System exemplify the core philosophy of PlusOne: Balance and harmony, equal but opposite, Um Yang.</div>

<br/>
</div>
<div>When applying the PreShave formulation, you'll experience significant cooling on the face, even during a hot shower or a hot towel treatment. This allows beard whiskers to become softened by the heat and humidity, while the skin stays tight and level - much like a cold compress.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Next is a slight numbing sensation on the skin. This is extremely vital as skin will not signal the reaction of swelling if it cannot detect the scraping and abrasion of the shaving process. This allows the hair to be cut with any shaving tool while keeping freshly shaved hair and at the skin level. In turn, hair will not become trapped below swollen skin and create an ingrown hair.</div>

<div>And when balanced with the PostShave formulation, the optimal level of lubricants, antiseptics and soothing agents ensure freshly shaved skin stays clean, tight and smooth.

After much time and investment, I am incredibly proud to introduce the PlusOne grooming line of products to the world. PlusOne not only features unprecedentedly targeted formulations, but also feature an innovative bottling system focused on function, impeccable design and aesthetics.

Where almost all other shaving products available today focus simply on lubrication, fragrance and cooling after the shave, PlusOne's Pre/PostShave is far more comprehensive.





When applying the PreShave formulation, you'll experience significant cooling on the face, even during a hot shower or a hot towel treatment. This allows beard whiskers to become softened by the heat and humidity, while the skin stays tight and level - much like a cold compress.

Next is a slight numbing sensation on the skin. This is extremely vital as skin will not signal the reaction of swelling if it cannot detect the scraping and abrasion of the shaving process. This allows the hair to be cut with any shaving tool while keeping freshly shaved hair and at the skin level.

<p>In my years of experience working with hundreds
of migraine sufferers, I have found that the overall majority of people do not
have just one single migraine trigger. Most sufferers have migraines for
different reasons on different days or even more than one trigger at a time! To
identify your migraine trigger, simply smell each of the four blends. Whichever
one (or more) is pleasing to you is/are the blend(s) to use for this particular
migraine episode. Whether you react to one or more of our blends, your body and
brain instinctively knows which ones are needed to restore balance.</p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451565085/wim1rdqrn4v51evicdmd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>My name is Kelly Lott and I have been a massage
therapist for 25 years and a nationally certified massage therapy instructor
for 18 years. Over the years, I have treated hundreds of clients with headaches
and have become a Headache Specialist. Many of my clients reported using ice
packs to ease migraine pain, but complained that they didn’t stay cold enough, long
enough to cause effective migraine relief. This sparked the idea of using
marble stones, which retain cold for a longer time allowing for migraine pain
to dissipate. I also knew it would be helpful to combine this with
aromatherapy, to help calm the brain’s reaction to the migraine trigger. Thus
was born the holistic fusion that is Migraine
Miracle®! </p>
<p>Migraine Miracle® is divinely linked to my mother, who passed away shortly before I conceived of the idea for this treatment method. I felt my mom so strongly encouraging me to find a way to help people who suffer from migraines, and she was with me every step of the way as I moved forward in researching and developing the product. Her favorite saying to me was ""C'mon Kelly, keep up!""</p>

Men commonly suffer with cluster headaches, and 17% are children who suffer, commonly from food allergies and sports injuries. With each
migraine and migraine sufferer being different, it can be difficult to figure
out your triggers and find a suitable treatment. The medications available for
treatment often have terrible side effects, are addictive and may eventually lose
effectiveness or cause rebound headaches. For many migraine sufferers, each
episode can mean several days of pain and lost productivity at work and at
home. </span></p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<div><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">1. Why do you use marble and why does it need to be cold?</span></h3></div>
<div>In my research I found that marble which is a very porous stone keeps the cold longer than any other stone or even an ice pack. You can even make ice cream on marble, so I knew that marble was the right choice. You need the cold to help reduce the swelling of the blood vessels in the head and neck. It happens naturally and very quickly, giving you almost instant relief. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">2.  How do I know if my headache is a migraine or just a headache?</span></h3></div>
<div>A ""regular"" headache can usually be helped with over the counter medication. A migraine will be something that renders you unable to function normally. The pain is so severe that you can't sleep, work, or drive for instance. You may have extreme sensitivity to light, smells and sound and feel that you need to go to a dark, cool and quite place until it subsides. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">3.  Will this method cure my migraines?</span></h3></div>
<div>No, there is no known cure for migraines. What this method does is help you to prevent a migraine while helping you to determine your migraine triggers. Knowing what are the potential causes of your migraine is huge.  This knowledge empowers you to live your life instead of worrying when the next one will come. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">4.  Should I journal my headaches?</span></h3></div>
<div>Yes, I highly recommend it. For one week, write down everything you do, what you eat and when, how much sleep, and especially what you were doing when you feel the symptoms of a migraine coming on. This is an excellent way to help determine your sensitivities, and then put a plan together to avoid the triggers. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">5.  Can I use this method for allergies and/or sinus pain?</span></h3></div>
<div>Yes! Many people who suffer allergies and sinus headaches have let me know that Migraine Miracle helped them to feel better by overcoming the swelling of the sinuses along with relieving the pain and pressure. These cold marble stones work beautifully in reducing the swelling and itchy eyes. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">6.  Do I have to use all 12 stones?</span></h3></div>
<div>No. My motto is put the stones where you hurt the most. If you need a big stone right in the middle of your forehead, then go for it. Let your body and pain be your guide. Use some, or use them all. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">7.  How often can I do the treatment to myself or a loved one?</span></h3></div>
<div>As many times as you wish. This is a natural holistic method, there are no side-affects to doing the treatment many times a day or week. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">8.  What if I don't like any of the essential oil blends?</span></h3></div>
<div>Your brain may not need balancing at the moment. Usually when you like an aroma, it comes from being over stimulated or depleted from something. Simply breathing in the essential oil blends creates 'aromatherapy', bringing harmony to your body and mind.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">9.  What is the carrier oil in your blends?</span></h3></div>
<div>Safflower. A very gentle carrier that helps the blends be subtle yet strong enough to calm the brain. I know many migraine sufferers have triggers from smelling strong odors. Do not fear these blends, they are made especially for migraines.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">10.  Is it alright to use this method on kids?</span></h3></div>
<div>Yes. Children over 12 can enjoy the cold marble and aromatherapy. If the stones feel a little too cold, you can have your child or you hold the stones between the hands for about 20 seconds. That will take the edge off of the cold, and then apply where they want them. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>For children under 12, I recommend using a few drops of each essential oil blend on 4 different cotton swabs. Have them breathe in from the cotton swab tip instead of applying directly to the skin. When they choose a blend, you can give the cotton swab to them to hold and breathe from as they wish. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>After removing the stones from the refrigerator, I suggest warming the stones in between your hands first before you apply to the child's skin. Let them feel the stone on the back of their hand first, to confirm they want the stone on their head and/or neck. Every child I have worked with absolutely loved the cold stones. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><h3><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">11.  Does caffeine affect migraines?</span></h3></div>
<div>Yes! About 80% of migraine sufferers are addicted to caffeine. The problem with caffeine is that it helps in the short run as it is a vascular constrictor. However, when you come off of the caffeine, you can get a rebound headache. Caffeine withdrawal can be very uncomfortable, and hard to do, so many people continue with the coffee, tea or soda all day. This will only maintain your migraines, not help in the long run. I suggest weaning off the caffeine slowly and you will find the headaches don't come back as often. Over the counter headache medications all have caffeine in them to speed up the pain reliever. This can also cause rebound headaches when over used. </div>

What Makes Migraine Miracle a Revolutionary Treatment?




More than 60 million people in the U.S. suffer
from migraine pain – a neurological and vascular ailment that is much worse
than a bad headache. The symptoms can be so debilitating that a person is
rendered incapable of working or carrying out daily tasks at home.In the past, the main treatment options for migraine
sufferers are strong prescription medications that may eventually lose
effectiveness and cause rebound headaches. And for migraine sufferers who
choose to cope without medication due to ineffectiveness or how it makes them
feel, then the only relief is hours (or even days) of lying down in a dark
room. Now there is an
inexpensive, extremely effective, fast-acting natural therapy is available that
any sufferer can use at home, at work or while traveling, to quickly relieve
migraine symptoms. Your support will help us get the word out about Migraine
Miracle® to the global community of migraine sufferers, friends, family
and medical practitioners.  
How It Works 

Migraine Miracle works
by combining three processes:

 °  relieving the vascular swelling that causes
migraine pressure and pain by using the cold stones in select areas on the head
and neck.

  ° calming the brain using one or more of the included essential
oil blends that correspond to the four main migraine triggers: Food Allergies,
Environmental Agitation, Stress, and Hormone Imbalances.

  ° by performing pressure point holds on oneself to relieve sinus pressure and headache pain. 
 Many migraine
sufferers aren’t sure what causes their headaches, or they can have a
combination of triggers. How will you know which oil to use for a given
migraine? Simply smell each of the four blends. Whichever one (or more) is
pleasing to you is/are the blend(s) to use for this particular migraine
episode. The brain will know what it needs to become balanced again-either it
is depleted or over stimulated by something.



Cold Stone Therapy




Cold stone therapy is one of the key factors
in Kelly Lott’s Migraine Miracle® holistic fusion. Her Cold Stones are specially shaped and hand-crafted from marble. The white color is important for strength, structure and perfectly suitable for maintaining the 36°
temperature recommended for maximum relief of swollen blood vessels. Keeping
your Cold Stones in the refrigerator is convenient and provides the optimum temperature
for immediate use.


Kelly's Four Proprietary Essential Oil Blends

Kelly Lott’s Migraine Miracle® includes four custom proprietary blends of essential oils for the four most common
headache triggers. 

  ° Food

  °Environment

  ° Stress

  °Hormone 
The blends were created by a Certified Medicinal Aromatherapist and Blender with over 30 years experience. Only
therapeutic-grade essential oils are used in the essential oil blends. Pure
plant energy is derived from herbs and plants that have been personally grown
and harvested by our suppliers.






Pressure Point Massage

help relieve sinus pressure and headache pain. Pressing in to your sinus points
(beside your nostrils) also an excellent way to relieve pressure. Be sure to
hold each point at least 20-30 seconds according to your pain threshold.

I have personally funded this project so far through my own savings and with the help of family and friends. But now I need more friends! I have the marble stones, and essential oil blends ready as well as the design of the new packaging. I need your help to cover the
costs of  producing the new packaging and starting an extensive year-long
online marketing campaign to get the word out there!  If you can help me fund the next
chapter, you will help millions of migraine sufferers learn about an inexpensive,
effective, natural and holistic treatment for their symptoms – one that will help
them get their life back! *Please note that your Perks will ship immediately after the campaign has funded. You will receive the current packaging, but rest assured that everything in the kit is brand new and perfect. I want you to get migraine relief right away and get your life back!

My Story


My name is Kelly Lott and I have been a massage
therapist for 25 years and a nationally certified massage therapy instructor
for 18 years. Over the years, I have treated hundreds of clients with headaches
and have become a Headache Specialist. Many of my clients reported using ice
packs to ease migraine pain, but complained that they didn’t stay cold enough, long
enough to cause effective migraine relief. This sparked the idea of using
marble stones, which retain cold for a longer time allowing for migraine pain
to dissipate. I also knew it would be helpful to combine this with
aromatherapy, to help calm the brain’s reaction to the migraine trigger. Thus
was born the holistic fusion that is Migraine
Miracle®! 
Migraine Miracle® is divinely linked to my mother, who passed away shortly before I conceived of the idea for this treatment method. I felt my mom so strongly encouraging me to find a way to help people who suffer from migraines, and she was with me every step of the way as I moved forward in researching and developing the product. Her favorite saying to me was ""C'mon Kelly, keep up!""

The Impact







 ° 60 million migraine sufferers in the U.S. alone. 
 ° 17 billion dollars are lost in productivity work hours every year.
 °13 billion dollars are spent in medication, doctor and ER visits every year.
Two thirds are women between the age of 12 and 60. Men commonly suffer with cluster headaches, and 17% are children who suffer, commonly from food allergies and sports injuries. With each
migraine and migraine sufferer being different, it can be difficult to figure
out your triggers and find a suitable treatment. The medications available for
treatment often have terrible side effects, are addictive and may eventually lose
effectiveness or cause rebound headaches. For many migraine sufferers, each
episode can mean several days of pain and lost productivity at work and at
home. 

 Migraine sufferers go to great lengths searching for a product that is easy to use, is safe and effective with no detrimental side effects. The latest trends are Botox injections, while others have tried surgically implanting electrodes in their brains. Both of these methods can be extremely dangerous and may provide minimal results. Also, neither of these methods can help to identify and address the ""cause"" of the migraine like Migraine Miracle can. Bottom line and most importantly is that Migraine Miracle works!
Migraine Miracle® offers these sufferers an inexpensive, natural, holistic, fast-acting
and safe alternative method they can perform on themselves in their own homes.
Your support will help with marketing to raise awareness about Migraine Miracle® in
the community of migraine sufferers, their family and friends, and their medical
practitioners. It will also help design and produce new packaging for the
Migraine Miracle® Home Care Kit, thereby completing production for this new product
and getting it ready to ship to those who can benefit from it.

Risks
and Challenges
After the new packaging is complete, the next
biggest challenge ahead of me is getting the word out to migraine sufferers,
their families and friends as well as medical practitioners that a natural,
effective drug-free therapy for migraine relief is available! This will take
some time, and dedicated efforts in social media, advertising and public relations. I am an expert massage therapist and
instructor, but I need help from experts in the world of online marketing. That’s why
I am putting together a dream team, to help me learn and manage my online
business, and to help this project and method become a success!

Other
Ways You Can Help
Don't forget there are ways you can help besides
backing our campaign financially. We do need to raise awareness in the broader
community of migraine sufferers, friends and family and medical
practitioners. Spreading the word can be done for free. If you love what you've
seen here, please tell every friend you have. 



FAQ
1. Why do you use marble and why does it need to be cold?
In my research I found that marble which is a very porous stone keeps the cold longer than any other stone or even an ice pack. You can even make ice cream on marble, so I knew that marble was the right choice. You need the cold to help reduce the swelling of the blood vessels in the head and neck. It happens naturally and very quickly, giving you almost instant relief. 


2.  How do I know if my headache is a migraine or just a headache?
A ""regular"" headache can usually be helped with over the counter medication. A migraine will be something that renders you unable to function normally. The pain is so severe that you can't sleep, work, or drive for instance. You may have extreme sensitivity to light, smells and sound and feel that you need to go to a dark, cool and quite place until it subsides. 


3.  Will this method cure my migraines?
No, there is no known cure for migraines. What this method does is help you to prevent a migraine while helping you to determine your migraine triggers. Knowing what are the potential causes of your migraine is huge.  This knowledge empowers you to live your life instead of worrying when the next one will come. 


4.  Should I journal my headaches?
Yes, I highly recommend it. For one week, write down everything you do, what you eat and when, how much sleep, and especially what you were doing when you feel the symptoms of a migraine coming on. This is an excellent way to help determine your sensitivities, and then put a plan together to avoid the triggers. 


5.  Can I use this method for allergies and/or sinus pain?
Yes! Many people who suffer allergies and sinus headaches have let me know that Migraine Miracle helped them to feel better by overcoming the swelling of the sinuses along with relieving the pain and pressure. These cold marble stones work beautifully in reducing the swelling and itchy eyes. 


6.  Do I have to use all 12 stones?
No. My motto is put the stones where you hurt the most. If you need a big stone right in the middle of your forehead, then go for it. Let your body and pain be your guide. Use some, or use them all. 


7.  How often can I do the treatment to myself or a loved one?
As many times as you wish. This is a natural holistic method, there are no side-affects to doing the treatment many times a day or week. 


8.  What if I don't like any of the essential oil blends?
Your brain may not need balancing at the moment. Usually when you like an aroma, it comes from being over stimulated or depleted from something. Simply breathing in the essential oil blends creates 'aromatherapy', bringing harmony to your body and mind.  


9.  What is the carrier oil in your blends?
Safflower. A very gentle carrier that helps the blends be subtle yet strong enough to calm the brain. I know many migraine sufferers have triggers from smelling strong odors. Do not fear these blends, they are made especially for migraines.


10.  Is it alright to use this method on kids?
Yes. Children over 12 can enjoy the cold marble and aromatherapy. If the stones feel a little too cold, you can have your child or you hold the stones between the hands for about 20 seconds. That will take the edge off of the cold, and then apply where they want them. 

For children under 12, I recommend using a few drops of each essential oil blend on 4 different cotton swabs. Have them breathe in from the cotton swab tip instead of applying directly to the skin. When they choose a blend, you can give the cotton swab to them to hold and breathe from as they wish. 

After removing the stones from the refrigerator, I suggest warming the stones in between your hands first before you apply to the child's skin. Let them feel the stone on the back of their hand first, to confirm they want the stone on their head and/or neck. Every child I have worked with absolutely loved the cold stones. 


11.  Does caffeine affect migraines?
Yes! About 80% of migraine sufferers are addicted to caffeine. The problem with caffeine is that it helps in the short run as it is a vascular constrictor. However, when you come off of the caffeine, you can get a rebound headache. Caffeine withdrawal can be very uncomfortable, and hard to do, so many people continue with the coffee, tea or soda all day. This will only maintain your migraines, not help in the long run. I suggest weaning off the caffeine slowly and you will find the headaches don't come back as often. Over the counter headache medications all have caffeine in them to speed up the pain reliever. This can also cause rebound headaches when over used.",11.0,1,"1 Campaign

I am here to tell you about a brand new product called The EFOR Device.  While we only have CAD files (photorealistic design and pictures available, we need your support for prototyping, manufacturing and production.  We developed the EFOR Device in order to help

help people in need of a solution for eye pain, long-term damage and stress.</p>

<p>Studies have shown that debris under
the flap of the eyes can lead to glaucoma, also the human body is constantly
under 14.5 pounds (psi) of atmospheric pressure daily, this could be a reason
we feel tiredness around the eye areas at the end of the day, the EFOR device
creates a negative pressure around the eyes therefore relieving the tiredness
you feel in the eye areas.– This
fact prompted us to dig deeper into a solution. 
This is where we started to envision “EFOR Device” and all the possible
benefits we could bring to people:</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Lower
medical bills</p>
<p>·<span>  Relieve </span>

<p>When reviewing these
benefits, features and much more, it inspired and assured us that this is a
business that needs to be created. We feel if executed properly we can reach a
large market of people in need of an easier way to clean out their eyes.  Our features will make us incredibly
qualified to succeed in the eye care industry. 
This paired with attention to detail and quality service will make us a

<br/></div>","Hello! I am here to tell you about a brand new product called The EFOR Device.  While we only have CAD files (photorealistic design and pictures available, we need your support for prototyping, manufacturing and production.  We developed the EFOR Device in order to help
people remove foreign objects from their eyes, avoid costly doctor and
emergency room visits and help relieve eye stress from staring at small objects
or computer screens.  We think it will
help people in need of a solution for eye pain, long-term damage and stress.
Do you ever think about giving your
eyes a break, they are the one body part that is active all day long?
Do you want to find a portable and
efficient solution to eye pain but don’t know how?
Are you interested in visiting a doctor
but don’t have the time or money?
If you answered, “Yes” to any of these
questions, you may want to keep reading…

Our popular culture reinforces the idea
that eye care is very expensive. We're out to change that fallacious idea one “EFOR
Device” at a time! Help us establish this initiative to serve people in need of
a solution. For a pledge of $(149.00) gets an “EFOR Device” to an individual
and can change their ideas about what they can accomplish for the
rest of his or her life.  Finding out
your eye pain or discomfort can be solved with ease will be life changing. Empower
us to make this vision a reality with a donation to this project today!

Studies have shown that debris under
the flap of the eyes can lead to glaucoma, also the human body is constantly
under 14.5 pounds (psi) of atmospheric pressure daily, this could be a reason
we feel tiredness around the eye areas at the end of the day, the EFOR device
creates a negative pressure around the eyes therefore relieving the tiredness
you feel in the eye areas.– This
fact prompted us to dig deeper into a solution. 
This is where we started to envision “EFOR Device” and all the possible
benefits we could bring to people:
·  Lower
medical bills
·  Relieve 
pain
·  Less
stress on your eyes

Features:
·  Portable
·  Convenient
·  Easy-to-use
When reviewing these
benefits, features and much more, it inspired and assured us that this is a
business that needs to be created. We feel if executed properly we can reach a
large market of people in need of an easier way to clean out their eyes.  Our features will make us incredibly
qualified to succeed in the eye care industry. 
This paired with attention to detail and quality service will make us a
key player if not leader in the eye care industry. Our mission is to take care
of every funder, supporter and customer with the upmost respect and care.  We feel this will be the key to our growth.

Our company is passionate with creating an unmatched solution that’s going to keep your eyes
feeling great and rested for your busy day’s needs. Our company will run the
business based on our mission statement of reducing avoidable eye issues and
strain and severe visual impairment by raising awareness on how to keep your
eyes clean with our great, easy-to-use tool.

I am 1 of the 1000 people diagnosed with this rare brain disorder: Chiari Malformation or Arnold Chiari Malformation.It is a condition in which the brain has outgrown the skull, causing the cerebellum portion to grow downward into the spinal column. Unfortunately, the spinal column is already filled with the spinal cord. So the result ends up being overcrowding of the spinal column and crushing of the spinal cord. Since the brain and the spine are affected, symptoms and related conditions are numerous. At last count there were 86 possible symptoms.  I happen to be one of the lucky ones so far. I only have 23 of the 86. My vision Is distorted so I can no longer drive. My eyes are imbalanced, causing them to oscillate, are nd my balance problems have caused numerous falls, the worse resulting in a broken ankle. These have been the worse symptoms  However the pain is constant. As an adult patient I see bits of my life slowly disappearing. This disorder however is genetic. Children as young as 1 have been included as patients of this dreadful disorder.   I read stories of parents and grandparents pleading desperately for help. Its a painful, debilitating disorder and there is no cure. Usually it takes years to even diagnose since most physicians are not  familiar with the condition, it's symptoms or its treatment. The greatest frustration of those affected with this condition is in locating a knowledgeable physician. The symptoms are often attributed to other conditions until an MRI of the brain is finally done. <div> Repeated, unexplained falls, blurred off balanced vision and horrific headaches finally forced my physicians to perform the MRI. I had to terminate the services of 2 neurologist before finding one that was familiar with the condition beyond what he had read about in medical school.

I couldn't imagine being the parent of a young child facing a brain disorder, and brain surgery.. Or preparing to go through an MRI. Or asking desperately if anyone knew of an experienced neurosurgeon because my young child needed brain surgery. I had my first surgery last week. A cervical spine fusion. One of the many related conditions. As soon as I am healed enough, I will have the recommended treatment: decompression surgery of the brain and spinal cord. Note it is merely a treatment.  There is no cure. </div><div>My hope, like every other Chiarian is that the pain and symptoms will lessen, progression will be halted and we can somehow regain our lives back. Money is being raised to increase awareness about this terrible condition, to increase education within the medical community and to research conditions and hopefully lead to a cure. I am seeking help however for those affected themselves by this terrible disorder. This is a very lonely condition. Once you convince your family's , friends and physicians that your pains are not ""in your head"" ,exaggerated. or imagined or that you really aren't lazy or depressed,  you need all the support you can get. I am hoping to support the patients and their families through this very rough time. The stress and burdens of everyday life are often forgotten at times like this. A parent that has to travel to get help for their child has many uncovered needs. An adult patient, such as myself, may live alone and require someone just to help with household chores I can no longer do.

Our
 campaign is designed to help people quit and stop smoking tobacco. It 
is a well known fact that smoking tobacco leads to serious damages in 
health, quality of life and finances. We cannot pretend that it is not 
our business, because we all have someone we care about who is still a 
smoker. One of every five deaths in the United States can be attributed 
to smoking:

substitute regular tobacco & cigarette smoking for affordable 
electronic cigarettes. The vaping experience is a fun and popular 
substitute to regular cigarettes, which does not carry the same health 
risks and is better for the environment,just check that proof of experienced heavy smoker!

which keep that project alive only,plus we will create successful blogs to popularize  that opportunity,and reveal all scientific prove and related info.Unfortunately most web stores (e.g. ebay, amazon, etsy, etc.) do not 
allow the sale of these products for unknown reasons. We would like to 
reach as large of an audience as possible without sticking our hands in 
people's pockets, as many greedy local stores and businesses do.
2.Free samples give away for people who is want to give up regular smoking.
3.Manage advertisement for popularization of quit smoking along with contest campaign and sports competitions or any other healthier events like exhibitions of artists,musician festivals,etc. and many other activities.
WE

damages health with incurable diseases like lung cancer for example, we 
know that preventative care such as smoking cessation is the only way to
 truly prevent this damage.

 Fact: Also spiritually we know the facts from our life already: 
share with people what you want to comeback into your life: 
Want Love? share love with everyone-its come back to you with more passion and from everyone, even those you do not know
You  want more money?-give away money! its will come back to you more ,more and more! 
Everything you want?!!!Yes! Anything!!!Just one suggestion only:give away freely ,happily and easily!!!And would be comeback as boomerang with  greater ease than you even imagine!
I'm personally love and respect of Joe Vitale, Louise L. Hay , Osho ,Ronda Byrne  ,as my mentors ,personal guru and believe in karma and reincarnation!   **************************************************

E-cigarettes
 are a new solution that's not perfect yet, but logically and factually it's
 less damaging for the health (practically non-damaging if products do 
not contain nicotine and are made by strict quality standards). These 
products do not contain tar, carbon monoxide, arsenic, formaldehyde, and
 other toxic and carcinogenic contents of regular cigarettes. 
E-cigarette users have the option of interchanging either nicotine or 
non-nicotine containing oils/liquids inside the tanks/atomizers of the 
cigarette to their liking,and also can choose 100% natural content.

WHY WE WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL: 

We have more that 2 years experience wholesale and online retail e cigs products & accessories  sample booth(website)with most affordable E cigarettes prices on the market!   and combine  almost 7 years in retail vapor stores as partnership;

We have direct relationship with brand name manufacturers and proven record of wholesale;
We already doing this with minimal profit,but for better and faster performance we need some additional leverage ;
We know what we doing and what would be next(we always bring newest and more advanced products on the market in first hands! from manufacturers)!
We
 bring a more affordable, environmentally friendly, fashionable and 
healthier solution by creating this project for people who want to but 
cannot quit smoking! 

Products::


  advanced Highly discounted e cigarettes Famous Brand names such as:Aspire,KangerTech,JoyeTech,Horizon,Smok,Eleaf(Ismoka), Itaste,Innokin and many more all of those we will offering to purchase  directly from us, which offers customers savings of 30-50% on the same or better quality products they would have purchased elsewhere.      sample booth(website)with most affordable E cigarettes prices on the market!                                                                                                                                                                                                    

By
 encouraging use of e-cigarettes over regular cigarettes, we may prevent
 people from even trying regular cigarettes and becoming addicted, since
 regular smoking is no longer considered cool! Remember, please, dear 
contributor, how regular tobacco smoking affects young adults, pregnant 
women, breastfeeding, even passive smokers, which every single one of us
 non-smokers unintentionally become, when we are exposed to tobacco smoke
 in public places. As long as there is even one smoker in the world, we 
are all exposed to the damage of their cigarette. 
The
 only way we can stop this right here and right now - if we try to end 
smoking once and for all. By participating on this website you are able 
to help do this!
Can We  stop this sometimes??? Yes,of cause,if never give up and We try to do that ,Here , Right Now by doing this contribution on this site! 

What people and professional are saying...





*""I started using e cigarettes with starter kit and I am sure I did the best decision in the last 5 years, haha .Already saved a lot of money and a few years of my life :)"" Andrew Patterson ,quit regular smoking fellow  at SparkPeople.com
*""E cigarettes should be a last resort to quit smoking..."", the American Heart Association says in a new  statement.
*""E cigarettes is safer and great substitute for the cigarettes ,because do not contain TAR,which is major cause of cancer""...Dr. David Baron,M.D
*Researchers also compared the toxicant levels in both e-liquids and aerosols versus tobacco smoke. They found that e-liquids and aerosols were much lower in toxicants and that their carcinogen content was “negligible.” This is supported by a finding by Roswell Park Cancer Institute researchers. They reviewed 12 e-cig brands and found that toxicant levels were 9 to 450 times lower than in cigarette smoke.
and many more....

The reason that I started this campaign is to honour my grandfather Benjamin Gaudet who is stricken with bone and lung cancer. Cancer is a horrible disease that affects 2 in 5 Canadians and 1 in 4 will die from this disease. The Canadian Cancer Society relates that in 2014 there were 76,600 deaths in Canada. Cancer touches the lives of everyone and in late 2014 it affected my Papa.  </p>
<p>My Papa has been a hard working man that came to Ontario from Digby, Nova Scotia, he got married and raised a family in the Oshawa area. He worked in the GM plant on the line for over 40 years. Benjamin Gaudet is an avid wood worker and has always taught his 6 grandchildren (including me) all about how to use a skill saw and how not to lose a finger. Whenever there was anything that we needed Papa was the first to help. He is a quiet but funny man who has touched so many and deserves so much more!</p>
<p>The 5,000 goal that my Dad and I are trying to raise is for the sole purpose of contributing to the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. To honour my Papa I have entered the Enbridge Conquer Cancer ride. This is a 200km journey that was designed to raise money and recognize all the people that are fighting or have fought cancer. To participate we are required to raise a minimum of 2,500 dollars each and I believe that this ride would be a wonderful way to demonstrate to my Papa  how much we will miss him. Although my grandfather has lost his fight I would like to make sure that no one else loses their Papa or anyone that means the world to them!</p>

<br/>When my youngest 
son was four, he was diagnosed with a rare kidney disease. So many 
emotions are involved when a child has a major illness, but one of the 
most overpowering is the sense of helplessness. The language the doctors
 speak is foreign, your life is now spent in a hospital, and the fear 
and tears have to be held back because you don't want to show your child
 just how terrified you are.<br/>Overnight our kitchen turned into a
 pharmacy. There were so many medications, procedures, and precautions we had to know and any mistakes we made could have had dreadful 
consequences. <br/>
</h3>
<h3>My son was not 
lucky. Most children who contract this disease eventually grow out of 
it. We fought it as hard as we could but finally his little kidneys 
couldn't fight anymore. He had to have surgery to have them removed. He 
would be on dialysis, placed on the organ transplant list, his 
medications would keep him alive, and we would have many harrowing 
episodes where he would have to be rushed to the emergency room. We went
 on like this for years. I quit my job and went to work as a janitor in 
my son's hospital. I hated that job but seeing his smiling face everyday
 made it worth it. It's hard to keep any job when you are always rushing
 to and spending so much time in the hospital. </h3>
<h3>
<br/>When my son turned 15 a wonderful thing happened.
 He got a kidney transplant. The change was miraculous. He could run and
 play. The disease had always stunted his growth but now he was getting 
taller. The pharmacy that was in our kitchen was gone. He only had to 
remember to take his anti rejection pill. When an organ is transplanted 
your body fights it because it is foreign material, the anti rejection 
medication stops your body from attacking the organ. So just the one 
pill and all of a sudden my son has his life back. No more hospital, no 
more pill regimen, and he was so happy.<br/>
</h3>
<h3>The bottom fell out of 
our world when we forgot to make sure he took his pill. It was the hardest 
thing I ever went through. Back to the hospital, back to the pills, 
instead of being happy we felt miserable. Nothing was harder than 
looking at my son and seeing in his eyes that he thought he failed me. And I thought
 I failed him. <br/>
</h3>
<h3>Ever since that time my son has been on 
dialysis. Three times a week. He never received another transplant. He 
was older now and the list was longer. Deservedly so, younger children 
go to the front of the line.<br/>
</h3>
<h3>My son adjusted. He takes his 
medicine and never misses his treatments. He plays the hand dealt to him
 like a real man and I am extremely proud of him. He lives in Las Vegas 
and has a beautiful singing voice and he performs in casinos and is a 
recording artist. <br/>
</h3>
<h3>But I could not move on. My mind would 
always go back to that awful day of the doctors explaining that the 
kidney could not be saved. It haunted me. I remember what they called 
it. Non compliance. I hated it because it made it sound like he chose 
not to take his meds. But it was just the medical term that was used to 
describe the broad problem. I also remember the doctors saying that this
 happens frequently to transplant recipients. Because they have been 
sick and feeling unwell but now with the transplant they feel great and 
it is a very easy thing to forget. It's just a pill, such a mundane 
little thing to do. So I just couldn't stop thinking about this thing. I
 started learning more about it. Not just transplant recipients, but 
diabetics, heart disease, hypertension, COPD, on and on. This thing was 
wiping people out to the tune of 125,000 deaths a year! And all those 
people like my son, who did not die but who suffered so much. And their 
families. <br/>I didn't know it at the time but I was pretty much an 
expert on the problem because I lived it. I knew all the products that were available to help
 people remember and organize their medication but I kept saying to 
myself, ""All these things remind you but nothing makes sure you take the 
medicine."" And that was the core of the problem. <br/>
</h3>
<h3>For example, I remembered watching my son on two specific occasions. 
My son had a really nice wristwatch with an alarm to remind him to take 
his medicine. The first time I noticed the problem with reminders was when my son's watch alarmed; he shut it off, but before he could take his medicine, the doorbell rang.  It was his buddies coming to visit.  If I hadn't reminded him he would have 
forgotten his medicine. The next time I saw the problem his watch alarmed while he was 
asleep. He was half awake when he turned off the alarm and went 
back to sleep. It was so easy to disregard the alarm. It did not protect him at all. Reminders only work when the circumstances are nearly perfect. But whose life is really like that?<br/>
</h3>
<h3>I don't know why those incidents stuck in my memory but 
they did. This was just stuff humans do. Real life distractions, events,
 and priority choices. And that was the key to why reminders have a 
major flaw. They can be turned off before the medicine is taken. It is 
too easy to get distracted by events or convenience. <br/>Over and 
over I turned this thing around in my head. It was years since that 
awful day but I was still angry about losing so much and now after 
studying so much, I knew this same scenario was playing out over and 
over. I guess if you think about something long and hard enough the 
light bulb finally comes on. ""It's too easy to turn the reminder off. 
The alarm should go off AFTER you take your medicine!"" I figured it out.
 And I knew enough about electronics to make a prototype. I put together
 a lab in my apartment and went to work. It was frustrating because it took so long to get parts.  I 
had to order each component and have them shipped.  Finally I had everything I needed. I put it together and the 
thing worked beyond my dreams. It was so easy to use and made sense to everyone who saw it. Back then I had no idea
 how far away I was from a real product and how many successes and 
disappointments were to come. Building the company, securing the 
intellectual property, designing the pendant, finding a manufacturer, on
 and on. I kept pushing, I kept trying, it's been more than six years but I kept going.<br/>
</h3>
<h3>Now, I have a market ready product and have a major pharmacy chain ready to put it in their stores. But it costs a lot of money to be able to fulfill the inventory, shipping, and legal costs. I want to be able to provide these pendants to the public. It breaks my heart when people ask for one of my pendants and I cannot give them one. I know it's for their health or someone they love and want to protect. I also want to show my son that all that he went through was for a reason. We can make it so other families won't have to go through what we did.</h3>
<h3>Almost everyone knows someone who takes medication. Help pass this story on because this could really make a difference in so many people's lives.<br/>

<p>My name is Jessica Schneider. I am seeking financial help
in attending the National Fibromyalgia and Chronic Pain Association's
2015 Treating and Preventing Chronic Pain Conference on October 8-10.
I am excited to hear directly from experts on subjects like orofacial pain, the
use of polysomnography (sleep study) as a tool in managing
chronic pain, alternatives to opioid medications for the treatment of pain, and
myofascial pain self-management. (That's just part of day one! You can view the
full conference schedule at: <a href=""http://www.paintap.org/program-speakers/)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.paintap.org/program-speakers/</a> )</p>
<p>I am one of the 100 million Americans who suffers from
chronic pain. I've had unrelenting chronic pain and muscle spasms since 2004.  After receiving a diagnosis of Fibromyalgia in
2005, I had a lot of questions. The pain I was experiencing at the time was not
under control by any definition. I was depressed. My weight went up with
nearly every new medication I was given. I was suffering from anxiety attacks
that made daily living even harder. Medication side effects essentially doubled
the number of symptoms I had to cope with. </p><p>My life changed again in 2006 when I went
to an online forum for people recently diagnosed with a chronic pain disease,
and I learned that I really wasn't losing my mind- I was “just” grieving …
and being forced through insurance step-therapy. While many of the tools and
techniques I still use today to manage my pain came from exam rooms, others came
to me as the direct result of talking to other patients. Before I was able to
truly fight back at the pain that had stolen my life away, I first had to understand
what I was fighting. I also needed to understand how to use the tools at my disposal, and that again, is where support groups helped me tremendously. This gave me
purpose, and that purpose gave me resiliency to keep looking for a better way
forward. </p>
<p>In 2011, I started a Fibromyalgia support group in the
Tucson metro area. To date, we have approximately 200 members, many of whom are
active in our online community and/or at face-to-face events in town.
We meet 12-14 times per year. The purpose of this group is to help provide
patients with a way to create a support network for themselves. It is a place
to share information, give encouragement, and ask questions.  This is the first time I have asked for any
significant financial contributions for or from this group, in any way. (We
don't even charge membership dues.) </p>
<p>Today, my symptoms are relatively well-controlled. I understand
how to travel long distances while minimizing fluctuations in symptoms caused
by travel itself. </p><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What
You Get</b></p>
<p>All money raised through this platform will immediately
go towards cost associated with attending this conference, detailed below:</p>
<p>$265 - Conference fee (by early bird deadline of 9/1)</p>
<p>($135/night) x 4 nights = $540 - Hotel </p>
<p>$450 - Airfare (round trip)</p>
<p>$60- Misc fees for hotel, airfare, or unforeseen transportation
needs</p>
<p>Total estimated cost: $1,315</p>
<p><i>Why four nights in a hotel for a 2-day conference?</i></p>
<p>One of the techniques that many support group leaders teach
is called <i>pacing</i>. Pacing encourages pain patients to slow down-
don't do everything at once!  Pacing encourages patients to work within
physical limitations to prevent further injury or pain, which can sometimes last for weeks. This extra day will
give me the opportunity to organize my notes and conference materials while
giving my body a short respite before travelling home after a very busy long weekend.
Since Friday's conference day starts at 9am and I am flying to DCA from Tucson,
I will need to fly into DCA on Thursday no matter what!</p><p><br/></p>
<p>While I'm at the conference:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'll
     ask your questions to the experts if I have the opportunity </li>
<li> Updates
     throughout the conference via Facebook and the web at <a href=""http://www.azfibro.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>www.azfibro.com</span></a> </li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p><p>When I return from this conference, I will host a series of
""debriefing"" events during the fall and winter months for my local Fibromyalgia support group. I’ll
also provide informational packets for attendees. </p>
<p>These hard-copy handouts will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hard
     copies of any conference materials that I bring home</li>
<li>Summaries
     of each conference session </li>
<li>Q
     &amp; A session for our group to cover anything I may have missed</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p><p>All funds that are raised through this platform will go
towards hotel fees, airfare, and conference fees. Any excess money raised will be
donated to the NFMCPA, a registered non-profit that works to create better
quality of life for pain patients through education and advocacy.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Many pain patients are unable to travel for conferences
like this one. Inability to miss days at work, inability to travel (period), or
the inability to pay are common barriers. Funding my trip doesn't just help me-
it helps pain patients everywhere learn how to manage their conditions more
effectively. This trip will give me a tremendous opportunity to network with
other support group leaders, as well. </p>
<p>People who suffer from chronic, non-terminal conditions
tend to have a better prognosis when they are well-informed about their health.
Although Fibromyalgia is one of the least funded diseases in the US,
researchers continue to make forward movement on more effective treatments and
a deeper understanding of chronic pain. Medical journals are often behind paywalls, which many patients cannot afford. Why read about treatment updates in
a journal when I can potentially hear it straight from the source?</p>
<p>Please help me reach my goal so that I can continue to help
other people take back their lives from unrelenting, poorly managed, chronic
pain and return to happier, more productive lives.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>If you are unable to contribute financially, here’s how you
can still help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share
     this campaign on social media</li>
<li>Help
     with copying and informational packet assembly when I return</li>
<li>Share
     my conference updates to other patients (Oct 8-10) in an effort to provide
     patients with relevant information about managing chronic pain</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for your support!</p><br/></div>","Short Summary

I will need to fly into DCA on Thursday no matter what!
While I'm at the conference:

I'll
     ask your questions to the experts if I have the opportunity 
 Updates
     throughout the conference via Facebook and the web at www.azfibro.com 

When I return from this conference, I will host a series of
""debriefing"" events during the fall and winter months for my local Fibromyalgia support group. I’ll
also provide informational packets for attendees. 
These hard-copy handouts will include:

Hard
     copies of any conference materials that I bring home
Summaries
     of each conference session 
Q
     & A session for our group to cover anything I may have missed

All funds that are raised through this platform will go
towards hotel fees, airfare, and conference fees. Any excess money raised will be
donated to the NFMCPA, a registered non-profit that works to create better
quality of life for pain patients through education and advocacy.
The Impact
Many pain patients are unable to travel for conferences
like this one. Inability to miss days at work, inability to travel (period), or
the inability to pay are common barriers. Funding my trip doesn't just help me-
it helps pain patients everywhere learn how to manage their conditions more
effectively. This trip will give me a tremendous opportunity to network with
other support group leaders, as well. 
People who suffer from chronic, non-terminal conditions
tend to have a better prognosis when they are well-informed about their health.
Although Fibromyalgia is one of the least funded diseases in the US,
researchers continue to make forward movement on more effective treatments and
a deeper understanding of chronic pain. Medical journals are often behind paywalls, which many patients cannot afford. Why read about treatment updates in
a journal when I can potentially hear it straight from the source?
Please help me reach my goal so that I can continue to help
other people take back their lives from unrelenting, poorly managed, chronic
pain and return to happier, more productive lives.
Other Ways You Can Help
If you are unable to contribute financially, here’s how you
can still help:

Share
     this campaign on social media
Help
     with copying and informational packet assembly when I return
Share
     my conference updates to other patients (Oct 8-10) in an effort to provide
     patients with relevant information about managing chronic pain
