<p>Hi everyone! The Guyanese people need your help. Guyana, on the north coast of South America, is a small country, still developing with resources that must be stretched among many competing needs. As a result, there is a shortage of available dollars to provide for the medical needs of the entire population. Ashley Menzies, Brittany McClerkin, and Liz Fisseha are traveling to Guyana to volunteer with Guyana Medical Relief (GMR), a nonprofit that raises funds to provide support for medical-related needs in
Guyana.  </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Ashley’s grandmother, Eula Menzies, founded
Guyana Medical Relief in 1984. As the daughter of one of the few physicians in
Guyana, Eula witnessed the plight of her people including the lack of access to
basic needs such as clean drinking water. Guyana is one of the poorest countries
in South America and the Caribbean. Parents fear that their children will not have access to the medicine they need. Many still live in areas that do not have clean drinking water. Simple procedures are difficult to perform due to the lack of resources. Ashley is determined to continue her
grandmother’s legacy by giving back to the people of Guyana. Most of the organization is run by her grandmother's peers, and they need the younger generation to step up and further GMR's cause. Your contribution
will literally save lives and strengthen a community in need. </span></p>

Aromatherapy Benefits
Aromatherapy is the use of essential oils and natural aromatic
botanicals for psychological and physical well-being. Its origins can be traced back to a 5,000-year-old Indian healing system known as Ayurveda. Incorporating
aromatherapy into your daily life now may ultimately prevent disease or
feelings of imbalance.
Aroma Robes provides access to natural healing on a
personalized, individual basis. Each aroma herb pack contains a specific
plant with its own unique healing properties – including lavender for
rejuvenation, chamomile for restoration and cinnamon for stimulation. Wearers
may also treat soreness or chronic pain by heating or cooling our
temperature-retaining neck and back wraps.

<h3>2013 - The Year of the GH0ST</h3>
<p>In the Uniterd States, the production of most longboard wheels are controlled by only a handful of companies.  GH0ST aims to change that, and you can have a direct impact on this effort by helping to contribute to our first production run.  We're not interested in making another cookie-cutter wheel using the same old urethane and hubs.  We're out to change the game!</p>
<ul>
<li>The first ever nested double-bearing longboard wheel. We've reinvented the wheel specifically for the needs of longboarders and street lugers.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Unprecedented speed and slide characteristics.  More than simply being a 'failsafe', the nested bearings will allow for higher top speeds by reducing overall rolling resistance and increasing the capacity for the wheels to carry momentum.  The slide characteristics will also be superior, allowing riders to break into slides effortlessly and 'hook up' out of slides predictably.  Since the wheels are centerset, you will get twice the use out of them, as they are reversible to prevent coning.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Be a part of the first ever crowdfund project to launch a new longboard/luge wheel company!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The first production run wheels geared toward freeriding will feature an 80A urethane in 72mm and 78mm sizes, centerset, 54mm contact patch, rounded lips.<br/><br/>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>Making wheels is a very expensive process and this is why there have not been many people who have tried.  With the support of the longboard community, we hope to change this with a unique product that has no precedent.</p>
<p>Our goal to raise a total of $3200 will cover the costs for our business license, patent application, and most importantly, machining for the wheel molds and hubs, buying the off-the-shelf parts, and paying for the molding by a professional urethane company necessary to make the first production run of GH0ST Wheels.  Any additional funds we receive will go toward the second production run of GH0ST Wheels specifically for downhill racing, featuring a soft grippy urethane, a larger contact patch and square lips.</p>
<p>We have added different contribution levels for those who would like different levels of rewards.  This adds a bit of diversity so you can make a choice that works for your budget.  You can get:</p>
<ul>
<li> a GH0ST limited -run screen-printed T-shirt</li>
<li> a set of 1st-production-run GH0ST Wheels</li>
<li> the whole package:  T-shirt, sticker pack, and a set of 1st-production-run GH0ST Wheels!</li>
</ul>
<p>We intent to mold the first few sets of test prototypes for testing before the full production run to ensure that the correct urethane has been chosen.  The testing results will be publicized here and on the GH0ST facebook page so you can view our progress.<br/><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You can help us 'break the mold' of the 'same old, same old' by contributing to our campaign.  You can get an awesome set of wheels from the first production run, and you help our dream come true, helping to support a brand new company that is dedicated to pushing the envelope!</p>
<p>Our goal is to make the wheels with the best speed and slide characteristics on the market, hands-down.  These wheels will not be for everyone but it is our goal to make as many people as possible, more than happy with our results.</p>
<p>GH0ST Wheels have been designed by a mechanical designer with 7 years of industry experience in design, machining, moldmaking and manufacturing/production methods in general.  The GH0ST concept has been 3 years in the making - it's time to introduce the GH0ST to the world.<br/><br/></p>

designed this medical device after being told by his doctors that he needed to
lay in bed for 6 months to relieve pressure off the ulcer. His only options for

crutches, his work capabilities would still be limited, so he designed 3MAX
support with the intention of creating a device that would allow him to be
mobile rather than be in bed the whole time all while the healing process was
taking place. The device freed his hands and even allowed him to wear his own

<p>I’m a trans man, which means that I was assigned a different gender at birth than I identify with. Because of this, there are some things with my body that don’t look the way they’re supposed to. The biggest of these is my chest. Every time I look in the mirror, I do not see the man I am becoming; instead, I see a girl and a betrayal. <em>My body is not the way it should be.</em></p>
<h3><strong>What does that mean? </strong></h3>
<p>Well, aside from being profoundly depressing (which it is) and causing me to look at my body as a prison instead of a shrine (which it does), there are also physical side effects. In order to minimize the look of my chest, I have been binding – or compressing my chest with heavy-duty binders – daily for over four years. In the day-to-day, this means that I have trouble breathing and engaging in strenuous activities, and I also deal with ongoing bodily pain and indigestion as a result. Over the long term, binding can lead to breakdown of the breast tissue, which can put a person at higher risk for certain medical conditions.</p>
<p>I know it sounds kind of crazy to undergo that kind of pain on a daily basis, but for me it’s a lesser of two evils. Physical pain is better than the mental distress I have any time someone calls me ma’am or I catch a glimpse of myself in a mirror.</p>
<h3><strong>How does this get fixed? </strong></h3>
<p>In order to feel at home in my body, I need to have top surgery. Top surgery is a tissue reduction and reforming procedure which removes the majority of the breast tissue and shapes the chest to a more masculine appearance. Unfortunately, it is also very expensive at around $10,000.</p>
<p>Like many people, I am uninsured (although most insurance plans do not currently cover sexual reassignment surgeries), and live on a tight budget. I am saving money and considering loans to help me pay for this medically necessary procedure, but it’s still a hefty chunk of change. As such, I am doing something which is very hard for me – asking for help to defray the cost of this surgery.</p>
<p>Can you help? No amount is too small (or too large!) and I am thankful for any help you can give.</p>
<h3>What can I do?</h3>
<p>Thanks for asking!  Donating in any amount is very appreciated (Seriously - a dollar or five goes a long way to making a difference!), but getting the word out is just as important.</p>
<p>I'm trying to raise about half the cost of top surgery - $5,000 - and I would love to be able to meet and exceed that goal.  Can you take a minute to spread the word?</p>

<h3>The Quest and the Vision...</h3>
<p>Hello friends and family alike!</p>
<p>My journey ""back to the land"" continues to blossom and has guided me to health and abundance mainly through one thing--PLANTS!  In a world plagued with pharmaceutical ""solutions"" and addictions, I am always striving to find alternative options for my own health and for the education of others.  In April, I am embarking upon a four-month intensive program with a medicinal herb school in northern California--there, I will be studying plants from the perspective of our Native American ancestors.  For me, this means finally settling into a passionate life-long trade of healing with the support and intention from YOU!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Investment...</h3>
<p>I need to raise $2,000 to complete my tuition payment and to provide myself with lodging for the four months I am in school.  When I discovered that three jobs wasn't going to cut it, I thought I would reach out to my amazing community of friends and family.  Anything helps, even if I can't reach the ultimate goal!  (20 people at $100 or 100 people at $20 or $2,000 people at $1!)</p>
<p>I want everyone to feel like YOU are a part of this incredible vision <em>with</em> me, so I look forward to giving back in any way that I can!  Even if that just means that you have a solid herbalist reference in your life--I am so happy to support your path to herbal healing!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact...</h3>
<p>As I deepen my heart song, I know that it becomes more and more important that <em>all</em> of us re-connect with the land and the healing modalities it has to share with us.  Through education and practice, I wish to heal the people <em>and</em> the land through natural botanical wisdom!   </p>
<p>If your finances are as tight as mine, please help me to pass the word along!  </p>
<p>Blessings!</p>

As the duo Womack and Bowman we perform regularly throughout LA at special events, celebrity parties, for film and television shows as well as for various tours with different Circus Companies. Our primary Aerial apparatus are the Silks but we also perform on Aerial rope, Trapeze, Straps, Lyra (hoop) and Hammock. As well as perform we also teach at various studios in LA and at a number of circus and dance facilities around the world.</span></p>

<br/><p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Verdana;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px;"">We have been professional Aerialists for the past twelve years and collectively have spent more then 25,000 hours rehearsing and training on various Aerial apparatus. Thats 25,000 hours spent in work out clothes! Having no ‘Aerial Clothing’  available for us to purchase, we would buy training clothing from dance stores and sports stores or regular clothing stores. The clothing we have purchased and worn ranges from leggings to sweat-pants to ballet leotards to sports bras to tank tops and so on. Even after twelve years, we still struggle with wardrobe malfunctions (tanks getting caught in the Fabric) and the dreaded ‘Fabric burns’ that happen if our skin is not covered. Leggings and tank tops, the staple attire of most Yoga or Pilates students don’t work for Aerial because as we invert (we do that a lot) the tank top rides up revealing the belly, we then wrap the fabric around said belly, roll or flip into a pose and BURN our skin painfully because the tank top did not provide adequate coverage! Shorts and sports bra's, the uniform of the runner, are also not appropriate for us, we need coverage on our legs and torso. Sweat pants are too baggy and get caught in the fabric during tricks, Ballet leotards protect from burns but adding layers (and lets face it, whose gonna wear a leotard without adding a tank or leggings?) give the dreaded ‘double bum’ look that comes with adding tights and the tank makes it super difficult and inconvenient to go to the restroom! (25,000 hours people!!) After a particularly nasty burn to her stomach last October while training with Brett, Rachel jumped off the Fabric (landing safely on a matt of course!) in exasperation and let Brett have it “I’m sick of this CRAP” (she may have used a different word) why has no one invented a Unitard for training so that we don’t have to deal with this?” Brett, in his usual pragmatic way responded “Rachel, there are plenty of Unitards out there, you just don’t like to wear them because they aren’t convenient or fashionable enough for your liking.” Rachel begrudgingly acknowledged that he was right. “You know, i would wear a Unitard if i could leave it hanging down, if it looked like a cute skirt when i wasn’t using it for training, then i could just pull it up over my regular bra when i wanted coverage” “hmmm” replied Brett “Perhaps there is something here?” And so the idea for the BurnFree work out Onesie for Aerialists was born.</span></p>

The goal is to create an all-in-one Unitard for female Aerialists and Aerial students (we plan to develop a male version soon boys!) that is durable, functional, dual-purpose and fashionable. Worn on the street it is a cute skirt, attached to a pair of leggings. Pull it up and it becomes a body hugging Unitard that protects the skin from Fabric burns. When worn as a skirt, the shoulder straps of the unitard fasten at the waist and look like part of the skirt. Go for coffee, run errands and no one will look at you strangely for having your underwear hanging out of your pants as often happens with the Ballet leotards or regular Unitards. </span></p>

By collecting USED Aerial Fabrics (when they eventually tear and become more ‘Holy then righteous’ the Fabrics are no longer workable) and cutting them into strips, they will then be turned into small draw-string bags which is what the Onesie will be packaged in. The Aerial Fabric bag is then available for the customers personal use, perhaps for their resin sock or spray, water bottle, Dramamine (just kidding!) or other aerial related tools!</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Verdana;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px;"">In the future, we plan to have a variety of work out clothing and performance options for the professional and amateur Aerialist but right now we are concentrating on the creation of a single product. With your help we can create, market, package and sell the worlds first Aerial training Onesie thus enhancing the lives of Aerialists all over the world! Think of the tender skins that can be saved! Think of the near strangulations that can be avoided (try hanging from your tank top twenty feet in the air) Think of the self-esteem that can be boosted (no more embarrassed Aerialists at the local Starbucks with their leotard straps hanging down to their knees!). The Aerial community is in desperate need of the BurnFree Onesie! Whether you are a budding Aerialist yourself or you have an interest in Aerial fitness or Aerial yoga classes, or perhaps you just appreciate a good Aerial performance in a Cirque Du Soleil show, contributing to this campaign in any way shape or form will have a positive impact on this wonderful community! </span></p>

This money will go towards the ongoing costs of labor, manufacturing, production, marketing and distribution costs as well assist us in obtaining the neccessarry business licenses and permits needed to legally start our business.  Obviously we are aware it will cost us more then $5000 to really launch the BurnFree Aerial workout Onesie but this amount will ensure that we are off to an excellent start! </span></p>

Creating a product that we are incredibly proud of and that we can truly stand behind is our primary purpose.</span></p>

We are Los Angeles based Aerial Artists Brett Womack and Rachel Bowman. As the duo Womack and Bowman we perform regularly throughout LA at special events, celebrity parties, for film and television shows as well as for various tours with different Circus Companies. Our primary Aerial apparatus are the Silks but we also perform on Aerial rope, Trapeze, Straps, Lyra (hoop) and Hammock. As well as perform we also teach at various studios in LA and at a number of circus and dance facilities around the world.

                                                  

                       
                                
We have been professional Aerialists for the past twelve years and collectively have spent more then 25,000 hours rehearsing and training on various Aerial apparatus. Thats 25,000 hours spent in work out clothes! Having no ‘Aerial Clothing’  available for us to purchase, we would buy training clothing from dance stores and sports stores or regular clothing stores. The clothing we have purchased and worn ranges from leggings to sweat-pants to ballet leotards to sports bras to tank tops and so on. Even after twelve years, we still struggle with wardrobe malfunctions (tanks getting caught in the Fabric) and the dreaded ‘Fabric burns’ that happen if our skin is not covered. Leggings and tank tops, the staple attire of most Yoga or Pilates students don’t work for Aerial because as we invert (we do that a lot) the tank top rides up revealing the belly, we then wrap the fabric around said belly, roll or flip into a pose and BURN our skin painfully because the tank top did not provide adequate coverage! Shorts and sports bra's, the uniform of the runner, are also not appropriate for us, we need coverage on our legs and torso. Sweat pants are too baggy and get caught in the fabric during tricks, Ballet leotards protect from burns but adding layers (and lets face it, whose gonna wear a leotard without adding a tank or leggings?) give the dreaded ‘double bum’ look that comes with adding tights and the tank makes it super difficult and inconvenient to go to the restroom! (25,000 hours people!!) After a particularly nasty burn to her stomach last October while training with Brett, Rachel jumped off the Fabric (landing safely on a matt of course!) in exasperation and let Brett have it “I’m sick of this CRAP” (she may have used a different word) why has no one invented a Unitard for training so that we don’t have to deal with this?” Brett, in his usual pragmatic way responded “Rachel, there are plenty of Unitards out there, you just don’t like to wear them because they aren’t convenient or fashionable enough for your liking.” Rachel begrudgingly acknowledged that he was right. “You know, i would wear a Unitard if i could leave it hanging down, if it looked like a cute skirt when i wasn’t using it for training, then i could just pull it up over my regular bra when i wanted coverage” “hmmm” replied Brett “Perhaps there is something here?” And so the idea for the BurnFree work out Onesie for Aerialists was born.

                                    
                                    Ouch! Rachel's fabric burn that began it all...
We have teamed up with the phenomenally talented clothing designer Lori Lee Gordon, who also designs all of our performance costumes, to create the BurnFree Onesie. The goal is to create an all-in-one Unitard for female Aerialists and Aerial students (we plan to develop a male version soon boys!) that is durable, functional, dual-purpose and fashionable. Worn on the street it is a cute skirt, attached to a pair of leggings. Pull it up and it becomes a body hugging Unitard that protects the skin from Fabric burns. When worn as a skirt, the shoulder straps of the unitard fasten at the waist and look like part of the skirt. Go for coffee, run errands and no one will look at you strangely for having your underwear hanging out of your pants as often happens with the Ballet leotards or regular Unitards. 

                           
                            From unitard to skirt in just a few seconds!

In keeping with our commitment to innovation and multi-function products and to do our part for environmental protection, we plan to package the BurnFree Workout Onesie in a highly original and completely sustainable way. By collecting USED Aerial Fabrics (when they eventually tear and become more ‘Holy then righteous’ the Fabrics are no longer workable) and cutting them into strips, they will then be turned into small draw-string bags which is what the Onesie will be packaged in. The Aerial Fabric bag is then available for the customers personal use, perhaps for their resin sock or spray, water bottle, Dramamine (just kidding!) or other aerial related tools!
In the future, we plan to have a variety of work out clothing and performance options for the professional and amateur Aerialist but right now we are concentrating on the creation of a single product. With your help we can create, market, package and sell the worlds first Aerial training Onesie thus enhancing the lives of Aerialists all over the world! Think of the tender skins that can be saved! Think of the near strangulations that can be avoided (try hanging from your tank top twenty feet in the air) Think of the self-esteem that can be boosted (no more embarrassed Aerialists at the local Starbucks with their leotard straps hanging down to their knees!). The Aerial community is in desperate need of the BurnFree Onesie! Whether you are a budding Aerialist yourself or you have an interest in Aerial fitness or Aerial yoga classes, or perhaps you just appreciate a good Aerial performance in a Cirque Du Soleil show, contributing to this campaign in any way shape or form will have a positive impact on this wonderful community! 
We have a goal of raising $5000 with our Indiegogo campaign. This money will go towards the ongoing costs of labor, manufacturing, production, marketing and distribution costs as well assist us in obtaining the neccessarry business licenses and permits needed to legally start our business.  Obviously we are aware it will cost us more then $5000 to really launch the BurnFree Aerial workout Onesie but this amount will ensure that we are off to an excellent start! 
If we don’t reach our entire $5000 goal with this campaign we will use the funds that we do raise to continue the research and development phase of the business. Creating a product that we are incredibly proud of and that we can truly stand behind is our primary purpose.
Perks! Did we tell you we had perks!? Contributing to our campaign does not just mean you are an awesome person who cares about the safety of the Aerial community at large but you also get FREE STUFF!! Our perks include custom designed Thank You cards, T-shirts, Aerial Silks workshop passes as well as private lessons!

<p>I'm one of a very small group of dedicated occupational and speech therapists in Trinidad and Tobago. We've decided to run Team Hope to raise much-needed funds to support the Trinidad and Tobago Occupational Therapy Association (TTOTA), as well as the Speech-Language Audiology Association of Trinidad and Tobago (SLAAT).</p>
<p>Team Hope has been successfully run twice before - in 2008/2009, and again in 2010/2011. The video above was created during Team Hope 2010/2011.</p>
<p>Team Hope is about ""helping ordinary people do extraordinary things"". A group of ordinary people like have embarked upon a seven-month journey with an extraordinary goal in mind - raise funds for two invaluable professions, and participate in the Rainbow Cup Triathlon in Tobago in JUne 2013. Each athlete is paired with an ""honoured teammate"", in whose honour they will complete the triathlon. These honoured teammates represent the individuals who receive or have received occupational and/or speech therapy in the country.</p>
<p>Each athlete has pledged to raise $4000TT for Team Hope, which will go to the Associations. As one of the occupational therapists, I can tell you that 40% of the funds raised will go towards Education and Development, 30% for Public Awareness Campaign, and the remaining 30% goes towards a Bursary Fund.</p>
<p>Please support me as I continue in my journey towards helping others, promoting health, and becoming fitter!</p>
<p>Please share this campaign as well so that others can recognise the work being done in Trinidad and Tobago, and raise awareness of these professions!</p>

Selecting the right golf ball can make a major difference in a player's game, confidence and enjoyment of the game. Unfortunately, golfers are barraged with performance claims from manufacturers, marketing gimmicks and a complex maze of pricing and performance challenges in finding - and buying the right ball - that provides maximum value and a real difference for the player.
                                     We conceived and built the GolfBallSelector.com Online Fitting System based on our patent-awarded and patent-pending golf ball evaluation and fitting technology - with the objective of Helping Golfers Become Better Golfers!
GolfBallSelector.com has been heralded as one of the top innovations in golf by Golf Magazine and other leading media - and is supported by rigorous and independent testing and data collection and processing by GolfBallTest.org. To date, we have robot, field and bench tested more than 200 leading golf balls, and provide regular updates when new balls are introduced to the market.




GolfBallSelector.com is entirely member supported - and we are entirely vendor-neutral and agnostic in our recommendations of the best golf ball for an individual golfer.    
We believe golfers, everywhere - regardless of their age, gender, experience level, should achieve the best performance possible in their game - and to trust and believe in their equipment - and their equipment choices.  The more we can raise, the more we can extend our independent golf ball testing programs - and the more golfers we can reach throughout the world - and involve them directly in soliciting their reviews and opinions on golf balls and golf equipment.  More testing, more data analysis - and the build out of independent rating tools and systems, such as TheRealList -- that we launched in the Summer of 2012 - will move us all further establishing the new consumer-centric platform for choosing the right golf ball: GolfBallAdvisor.com.                                      What We Need & What You Get


Our stretch goal for Crowd Funding the further build out GolfBallSelector.com is $150,000 and our first raise here is for $45,000.
With the proceeds from this initial fund raise, we will apply and combine funds to acquire and set up a new robotic testing facility and create new jobs, through our testing and data analysis.
Proceeds will then be used to build out the premier golf ball performance rating system - and to independently certify golf balls based on different types of performance, such as distance, control/spin, feel and value-for-money.   
If we don't reach our entire goal, the funding will be used to incrementally further the testing and global marketing of the GolfBallSelector system - to keep it independent and not reliant upon advertisements.  The funds that are raised will be used to pay staff and consultant salaries and keep the dream alive and flourishing!

a degree in baking, advice from some super motivational individuals, and finally - recipe perfection, I decided, I wanted to create my own product.
so here you have it folks, a healthy cookie aimed to help production of milk for pregnant mothers and their bosoms throughout breastfeeding. 


what mom's noms is all about
mom's noms is on a mission to help new moms increase their milk supply! these wholesome & delicious cookies; not only a healthy way to satisfy your sweet tooth during your pregnancy, but the beneficial ingredients will help your bosoms produce milk for your newborn! these cookies are bound to provide you with plenty of fiber, iron, & an abundance of healthy vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. mom's noms goal is to bake a natural treat with a ton of nutrients for you and your baby. straight from the oven, right to your tummy. breastfeeding is challenging! you deserve nurturing during this time-period too. mom's noms will make your taste buds tingle, your tummy smile, and most importantly they will help increase your milk supply in a healthy & natural way! your baby will smile too.
& even if you're not eating for two, you can enjoy these cookies just as much, and not lactate :) these delightful cookies are: 100% organic dairy free gluten free vegan
oh and did I mention the most important factor of all? these cookies are bound to be BIKE DELIVERED! what is better than a bike delivered baked good?


the impact
to get this project on a roll, I need your help to reach my goal!
as for progress and the current need for funding, I have been working endlessly on business plans, networking within the community, working out farmer's market details, food costs, and perfecting recipes. I have reached a point where mom's noms needs some exploratory funds for plans and licenses in order to get the ball rolling!


other ways you can help

spread the word! social networking! play telephone with your buds! if you have a friend who is expecting, feel free to send them in mom's noms direction.
 
thank you so much for your help!

<p></p></div>","What is OvarCare? 
OvarCare is a support program offered by Ovarcome Non-Profit
Inc. for ovarian cancer patients in active treatment at MD Anderson Cancer
Center, Houston, TX. 
At Ovarcome, we are inspired by the simple philosophy of
support, love, and celebration of life. Overcoming cancer - celebrating life!
We are here to help women as they fight the battle against ovarian cancer. Our
care package helps them take care of essentials as they undergo treatment while
feeling relaxed, peaceful, calm and beautiful. OvarCare is a package especially
designed for ovarian cancer patients in need for financial assistance – to
celebrate these incredibly strong and resilient women.
What does OvarCare
offer?
•  Financial
grant of $200 
•  Health
restoration consultation at The Healing Space by Dr. Monica
Roberson– 1 hour (worth at $350)
•  $100
Gas card 
•  $100
grocery card
•  A
$50 gift certificate to Cure & Co.
– a cancer wellness boutique and spa 
Who is it for? It is
for ovarian cancer patients who: 
· 
Have a diagnosis of ovarian cancer certified by
an oncology healthcare provider 
· 
Are in active treatment at MD Anderson, main and
regional centers in Houston and Greater Houston areas
· 
Are a newly diagnosed or existing ovarian cancer
patient 
· 
Are currently Texas residents (we will increase
our locational scope 3-6 months upon initiation)
· 
Meet our financial eligibility guidelines of
265% of the Federal Poverty Limits and are able to provide income verification
documentation
How can eligible
patients apply?
The application process has been designed in partnership
with MD Anderson. Details of application and disbursement of the OvarCare
package will be shared with patients upon selection.
How can YOU support the OvarCare
program?

The OvarCare package is
     worth $800. Currently we are offering one
     care package/month. With collective support, we could offer the care
     package to more patients who would benefit from this assistance. Your
     total cost to sponsor one OvarCare package is $500
You can choose to sponsor 1, 2, 3 or as many women/ovarian
     cancer patients as you would like to support. You can also choose to co-sponsor with 1 or 2 friends 
Should you choose to
     sponsor OvarCare, we will disburse the gift in honor of the name you select.
     It would be something like OvarCare: A Smith Family Gift OR
     OvarCare: A Smith & Jones Family Gift (should you choose to
     co-sponsor) 

We will share primary
     patient information (barring any confidential clinical information) with
     all sponsors 
We will feature each
     sponsor on our website every month (with names and pictures if you give us
     approval) 
All OvarCare packages will
     initially be disbursed to Texas residents only. We will increase the scope
     of giving 3-6 months upon initiation 
Your contribution is
     tax-deductible. 100% of your donation will go towards OvarCare.OUR PLAN: 1
patient/month
OUR GOAL:  5 patients/month
Help
us make a difference. Your contribution directly impacts and improves the life
of an underprivileged woman who is fighting the battle against ovarian cancer
in the hope of overcoming it.Background on Ovarcome: Our mission at Ovarcome is to raise awareness on ovarian cancer among women worldwide and to provide treatment support to underprivileged women in developing nations. We partner with MD Anderson, The Methodist Hospital, Rice University, Christian Ministries of Africa, IACAN, AYZH and several other organizations in the US. Our partnership in India is with Tata Medical Center where we work with their team of doctors and social workers to identify underprivileged women diagnosed with ovarian cancer who could benefit from our financial support, and sponsor their chemotherapy treatments. You can learn more about our work, and the distinguished group of individuals who are associated with our Board by visiting  www.ovarcome.org and facebook.com/ovarcome. In 2013, in observance of ovarian cancer awareness month in September, we partnered with Christian Ministries of Africa (CMA) to distribute awareness postcards to hundreds of women in Langata, and Kibera outside of Nairobi, Kenya. Kibera is the largest slum area of Africa. Our representatives talked to women in these regions about the signs & symptoms of ovarian cancer and discussed treatment options with them.We also hosted a workshop in Pune, India led by our Advisory Board member, Dr. Shona Nag. The workshop - ""Women's Cancers - Symptoms, Prevention and Screening"" was conducted in September 2013 by eminent Oncologist and a leading voice in the field of women's cancer therapy, Dr. Shona Nag, who addressed around 100 underprivileged women on various common cancers like breast, cervical, ovarian etc. that afflict women. The workshop was followed by the distribution of the Ovarcome Awareness Postcards (translated in Hindi). This workshop was conducted in association with Poona United Round Table 144, a member of Round Table India, an Indian non-profit, working extensively in the field of education for the underprivileged in India.Ovarcome was founded by Runsi Sen, the President and CEO, in loving memory of her beloved mother. Runsi's mother passed away from an aggressive form of ovarian cancer in February 2009. In her memory and with her inspiration, she created Ovarcome. Runsi 's dream is to see a world free from the scourge of cancer. Awareness is key as diagnosis in early stages can save lives. She is committed to this cause.....""I 'm devoting the rest of my life to saving lives
of women around the world through education, awareness, empowerment, early
action, and treatment support for underprivileged."" - Runsi SenHow else can you help?

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Technology that Simplifies</h2>
<p> Mom never leaves home without her smartphone, but could she find it, unlock the screen, and call for help in an emergency? Lively Wearable makes calling for help as easy as pressing a button – no finicky lock screens to grapple with under stress.</p>
<p><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">          </span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454714414/ws4kkoyi84kcecxasdws.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>   <p></p>
<p> Once Mom hits the button she’s connected to a 5Star Agent that’s armed with her personal profile, listing details like medications, conditions or even where a spare key is hidden. These details empower the agent to provide personalized help, so that emergency support can arrive quickly and informed. Meanwhile, as soon as the call ends, your Link app alerts you and lets you know her location. </p>

<div style=""margin:50px 0;"">
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Mom Stays Active</h2>
<p>We designed every aspect of the Lively Wearable for seniors, from a comfortable, easy to fasten band to an exciting from app for everyday motivation.  Beautifully designed and themed around travel, the Lively App encourages Mom to keep exploring, by offering daily mind and body challenges. Each challenge is designed for people like her, so she has fun and stays motivated.</p>

<p> The Lively Wearable can be worn around the neck or on the wrist. Fall detection is enabled when worn around the neck with the accompanying lanyard.  The device is available in two colors, white with gold trim, or gray with chrome trim, so you can pick a look that fits Mom’s style. </p>
<p> If Lively Wearable detects a fall, the device initiates a call via the user’s smartphone to GreatCall’s 5Star Service where a highly trained agent can assist. In the event that the user doesn’t respond to the agent, emergency services will be dispatched to their location.

 Introducing Lively Wearable - the stylish activity tracker that offers a discreet emergency response button. 


On a daily basis, Lively Wearable connects to Mom's smartphone* to count steps and offer daily challenges to help her stay active. 
In case of emergency, Mom presses the button on her device to connect via her smartphone to highly trained agents that can assess her situation and get her the help she needs.

*Lively Wearable will be compatible with Android 4.3 BLE devices
      in Spring 2016. iOS support coming Summer 2016.





As Featured In





 What Makes
      Lively Wearable Different 

 


Technology that Simplifies
 Mom never leaves home without her smartphone, but could she find it, unlock the screen, and call for help in an emergency? Lively Wearable makes calling for help as easy as pressing a button – no finicky lock screens to grapple with under stress.
          
   
 Once Mom hits the button she’s connected to a 5Star Agent that’s armed with her personal profile, listing details like medications, conditions or even where a spare key is hidden. These details empower the agent to provide personalized help, so that emergency support can arrive quickly and informed. Meanwhile, as soon as the call ends, your Link app alerts you and lets you know her location. 


Mom Stays Active
We designed every aspect of the Lively Wearable for seniors, from a comfortable, easy to fasten band to an exciting from app for everyday motivation.  Beautifully designed and themed around travel, the Lively App encourages Mom to keep exploring, by offering daily mind and body challenges. Each challenge is designed for people like her, so she has fun and stays motivated.





You Get Peace of Mind
With just a few taps on your smartphone, the GreatCall Link app assures you that Mom is safe, staying active and meeting her goals. She can feel safer knowing that if she does call 5Star for help, you’ll be sent an alert with her location, making it easier to be there for her when she needs you.


            


Two Colors, Two Ways to Wear 
 The Lively Wearable can be worn around the neck or on the wrist. Fall detection is enabled when worn around the neck with the accompanying lanyard.  The device is available in two colors, white with gold trim, or gray with chrome trim, so you can pick a look that fits Mom’s style. 
 If Lively Wearable detects a fall, the device initiates a call via the user’s smartphone to GreatCall’s 5Star Service where a highly trained agent can assist. In the event that the user doesn’t respond to the agent, emergency services will be dispatched to their location.
                


 


Easy, Three Step Set Up



That's it! Lively Wearable is easy to set up and easy to use. Plus, we offer live, US-based tech support, so Mom can reach help if she needs it.


What Our Customers Are Saying About GreatCall's 5Star Service
Lively Wearable is our first wearable device. But, GreatCall's 5Star service has been helping to keep seniors safe via our other products, like our GreatCall Splash and the Jitterbug phone since 2012.

Designed for Seniors Every Step of the Way
 Throughout our design process, we’ve continued to learn. We’ve reviewed research from reputable sources like AARP and the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA).  We’ve taken our prototypes to local senior centers to get feedback from actual seniors on the wearable’s design and app experience.  



 We’ve talked to family caregivers about their needs, and designed a new version of our Link app that gives them peace of mind without oversharing their parent's details.
                



Manufacturing Has Begun!
 We are proud to announce that we have begun manufacturing of this device.

<p><span class=""notranslate"">Thank you for taking the time to visit this page. I am grateful for you even coming here when there are so many people that are in need of help from others.</span></p>
<p>My name is Latisha and i am a very strong person and asking for assistance is very hard for me but i had to put aside my pride and have faith that i will make it through this very difficult time. I come from a broken home, my mom left me at 5 and i don't know who my father is and was raised by my aunt and had a very rough upbringing. I have alwyas tried to remain positive throughout all of life's trials and tribulations. I truly believe that when you put positive energy into the universe that is exactly what you get back.</p>
Getting this surgey will mean the world to me and will possibly save my life. i am very afraid but i have faith. i am 30 years old and don't have any kids and when they told me they recommend a hysterectomy my heart dropped because it was my dream to always have atleast one child. But even without being able to have a baby my two adorable dogs paris &amp; snoflake still give me great joy.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The surgery will cost anywhere between 3500 and 7000. There will be other costs for trips to the hospital as i get prepared for the surgery as well as medication and recovery after but i can only ask for the max for the surgery. Each and everyone that that is kind enough to donate atleast 100 dollars to me i will personally call you and express my genunine gratitude.</div>
<div> </div>
<p>It really hurts that i dont have family there for me to help me through this but i belive we are all family and there for each other. Please feel free to share my story and i thank you so so much for listening and even if you are not able to donate i am grateful for your time and consideration. May God Bless You!</p>

MSFC is the only MS cause of its kind.</p>
<p>I was diagnosed with MS in 2006 at the age of 47 and as a former bodybuilder<br/>and health club owner, I chose to take the disease head on through<br/>bodybuilding. Since that time I have won Most Inspirational at the FL State<br/>Bodybuilding Championship in 2009 at 50 years old after being told I was<br/>wheelchair bound; I’ve been featured on TV, radio and print; I have a book on<br/>the market in Barnes &amp; Noble and other outlets about my battle against MS<br/>called David’s Goliath, endorsed by Montel Williams and other celebrities; a<br/>movie production company is in discussions on a feature film on my story (the<br/>documentary starts in Dec); and most importantly I started the MSFC with Kendra<br/>to help others. </p>
<p>There is much happening in my fight against MS, as I<br/>prepare to compete in a bodybuilding contest again at 55, but the most<br/>important aspect of this journey is how Kendra and I am helping others with MS realize that the road to victory is in the gym. </p>
<p>MS is a very debilitating disease leaving us with damage to our nerves that<br/>typically makes life and its simple tasks very difficult. It is a disease of<br/>pain, numbness, coordination issues and with many symptoms that make our lives<br/>daily almost unbearable. MS can put people in a state of despair if they let<br/>it. We founded the MSFC to change lives and help those with MS have hope, goals<br/>and a lifestyle of health &amp; fitness. </p>
<p>The MSFC is endorsed by celebrities such as La Toya Jackson and country<br/>music singer Julie Roberts amongst others. We recently held an MSFC event at an<br/>independently owned gym in the small town of Sartell, MN where Julie, who has MS,<br/>performed. The event was a tremendous success as we enrolled people with MS as<br/>Challenge participants (more than 20% of all people with MS in that area)<br/>providing them with trainers, supplements and a gym membership free of cost. My<br/>organization pays for this through the donations of supporters and fundraising.<br/>The event was covered by local news and was promoted by the National MS<br/>Society. I am being approached by people with MS from all over the country<br/>asking to get involved in the Challenge. </p>

We currently have<br/>an event planned in the Orlando, FL area on Jan 18, another in San Diego in Feb and one in NY to follow. <br/><br/>We need your help to make sure the participants at the Orlando event have all the funds needed to provide the support from the MSFC since there is NO cost to them to join. </p>

Facebook.com/zaidiyadreams</p><p>After two weeks Valentine became ill and was taken to a private hospital since public hospitals are over crowded and under staffed, Death rates are high and care unpredictable. She was well when she arrived but with in an hour of her arrival she was in a serious condition with very low oxygen saturation. She was taken to ICU where she was diagnosed with aspiration phenomena and later bronchitis. Some doctors felt that it was linked to the pit latrine while some felt that the early damage to her lungs left her with little defences. By early morning she was placed on a respirator to allow her little body to survive while she recovered. She stayed in ICU for four days and a following three days in the wards.  With a bill of over $6000 we arranged transfer as soon as she was stable and seen as out of danger. The hospital refused to release her without payment. Having paid a hospital bill for another child for $3000 two weeks before we were unable to pay even a small amount of the bill. They eventually agreed to release her on the condition that i leave the ownership documents of my car with the hospital. She was taken to the hospital where she was first admited when rescued as they had agreed to treat her for free. After three days she became worse with a sudden drop in Oxygen saturation despite being on constant oxygen. We requested a doctor but non came. She was put on a mask and bag which we had been told she couldn't leave ICU while on. We insister on a doctor but after four hours she had not appeared and our requests to know when she would come went unanswered. An emergency doctor came to reaffix her line. He said she needed to be in ICU but her was unable to do the transfer until the doctor had come. He insisted he would get her doctor to come straight away. After two hours She still had not come. I went on three occasions to find the emergency doctor but found three patients waiting in emergency and  no one knew where the doctor was. At this point i decided to have her transferred to another hospital. I found out then that the Ambulance was broken. I asked the nurse what would happen if she got worse and needed a respirator, she told me 'We just have faith that, that wont happen'. Eight hours after her Oxygen levels crashed we left the hospital by private ambulance (it took an hour to come). At 3am we arrived at a mission hospital an hour out of town. She received very good care   there and is continuing to improve. They do not have enough oxygen monitors to go around but the nurses are doing a great job.  To date efforts to remove her from oxygen have failed.

<p><b>Why?</b></p>
<p>Chiapas is home to one
of the largest indigenous populations in Mexico, primarily of Mayan descent.
This region has a powerful,  500-year history of struggle for indigenous rights
and dignity that continues today.</p>
<p>The state of Chiapas has
minimal healthcare infrastructure, and the government clinics that do exist
have a history of poor care, discrimination and outright hostility towards the
Mayan communities.</p>
<p>To address this
healthcare gap, a group of indigenous community health workers has opened their
own clinic, located in the central plateau of Chiapas. The clinic is known as
Sve’ic, or “The Wind’s Path” translated from their Mayan language. Advanced
health workers provide essential services such as midwifery, gynecology, herbal
medicine and dental care. The clinic

</div></div>","Why?
Chiapas is home to one
of the largest indigenous populations in Mexico, primarily of Mayan descent.
This region has a powerful,  500-year history of struggle for indigenous rights
and dignity that continues today.
The state of Chiapas has
minimal healthcare infrastructure, and the government clinics that do exist
have a history of poor care, discrimination and outright hostility towards the
Mayan communities.
To address this
healthcare gap, a group of indigenous community health workers has opened their
own clinic, located in the central plateau of Chiapas. The clinic is known as
Sve’ic, or “The Wind’s Path” translated from their Mayan language. Advanced
health workers provide essential services such as midwifery, gynecology, herbal
medicine and dental care. The clinic
trains community health workers who can provide health education and attend to
basic health concerns thereby extending the clinic’s impact into more distant
communities that lack other healthcare options. 
An important part of their work includes acting as patient advocates for
community members negotiating the medical system. 
Currently, twenty new community
health workers are completing their first year of training, three of whom are
being trained as midwives. Their goal is to provide more specialized training
to these twenty people and, in January, begin training a new group of community
health workers to meet the continuing need for dignified and vital care.
What we are fundraising for:
We will be heading to
Chiapas this winter to support their work by offering trainings in women's
reproductive health, and we hope to bring as much medical equipment and
supplies as possible, including a microscope. 

A private donor has
already contributed $1500 towards this effort. 
We are hoping to match that, and then some!  Funds raised will help
defray travel costs and cover training and clinic supplies.
Future fundraising will
go towards supporting other health care practitioners to visit the clinic to
offer further training.

<p>Cath and I started <a href=""https://www.semainehealth.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Semaine</a> because we've had painful periods since we were teenagers. After years of taking over-the-counter pain meds, we were tired of the side effects and were looking for something that addressed the root problem of our pain. And we're not alone:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570466361/aeqxwquwqsxqvfunnpex.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Cath and I started testing <a href=""https://www.semainehealth.com/pages/ingredients"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Semaine ingredients</a> on ourselves nearly two years ago to get the exact combination of plant-powered ingredients that helped ease our period and endometriosis pain. When Semaine helped me get through my period pain free, we wanted to make sure it helped other women too.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, we asked 10 women to test Semaine by comparing a period without Semaine and a period with Semaine (filling out a detailed survey after each). These are the results:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570478028/bblh0awlhhyj8jyoj4z1.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Semaine was formulated by Lauren's husband Matt, while working in the University of Washington's Medical School. Based on extensive research on our immune response and our periods, <a href=""https://www.semainehealth.com/blogs/science/inflammation-and-your-period"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Semaine directly targets the inflammation</a> that spikes during our menstrual cycles.</p>
<p>What do your immune response and inflammation have to do with your period? Your immune system responds to your natural cycle. It's suppressed during ovulation and then comes roaring back when your period is about to start. People with more period pain tend to have a stronger immune response, and this means more inflammation:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1569957728/iflylmyuclir5ecbvvz9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Semaine is formulated with the perfect blend of <a href=""https://www.semainehealth.com/pages/ingredients"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>nine super-powered plant extracts</strong></a> that work together to <strong>restore balance</strong> to your body. Your body is a complex system, and the inflammation that increases during your period is the result of interconnected cascades, not just a single change. Instead of reducing pain by sledgehammering a single pathway (like you can do with pharmaceuticals), Semaine uses multiple plant extracts that have been shown to affect distinct pathways. By using the synergies that come from <strong>combining plant-based extracts, Semaine helps you feel better than if you just took megadoses of a single ingredient</strong>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1569959702/ut49kltic9jsxqpyjsfe.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Semaine’s formulation is the result of more than a year of intense research and testing</strong>. To decide what biological pathways we wanted to address, we pored over hundreds of scientific papers on period pain and the connections between IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome), inflammation, and pain. Then we researched dozens of different plant extracts, vitamins, and minerals to determine which had strong scientific evidence for specific mechanisms of action and also analyzed the quality of their clinical or pre-clinical trial data. Then we narrowed the list to select supplements that could work synergistically with one another. </p>
<p><strong>Each ingredient has been expertly sourced so that it's the highest quality, most bio-available form for your body</strong>. Not all supplement ingredients are created equal, and we wanted to make sure that not only was the supply chain <strong>fully transparent</strong>, and our ingredients rigorously and repeatedly tested for purity, but that your body absorbs the supplements as much as possible. So, not only do we use the <strong>world’s first vegan vitamin D3</strong>, but we rely heavily on <strong>phytosome technology</strong>. Phytosomes encapsulate supplements in sunflower lipids and are up to 30 times more bioavailable to your body—making sure your body gets the support it needs.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.semainehealth.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Semaine</a> (which means ""week"" in French) is for<strong><i> the week</i></strong> of your period. We know everyone's period is different, but long or short, on hormonal birth control or not, Semaine works best when it's taken a few days before the start of your first full day of bleeding. This allows the anti-inflammatory ingredients to do their work before the worst of your inflammation starts.</p>
<p>Take two pills in the morning (with or without food) and two pills in the evening. Do this for seven days once a month, or whenever you have your period.</p>

</div></div>","Semaine is a plant-based, anti-inflammatory supplement for the week of your period, created by a biologist and tested by the company's co-founders.

Cath and I started Semaine because we've had painful periods since we were teenagers. After years of taking over-the-counter pain meds, we were tired of the side effects and were looking for something that addressed the root problem of our pain. And we're not alone:


Cath and I started testing Semaine ingredients on ourselves nearly two years ago to get the exact combination of plant-powered ingredients that helped ease our period and endometriosis pain. When Semaine helped me get through my period pain free, we wanted to make sure it helped other women too.
Earlier this year, we asked 10 women to test Semaine by comparing a period without Semaine and a period with Semaine (filling out a detailed survey after each). These are the results:

 

Semaine was formulated by Lauren's husband Matt, while working in the University of Washington's Medical School. Based on extensive research on our immune response and our periods, Semaine directly targets the inflammation that spikes during our menstrual cycles.
What do your immune response and inflammation have to do with your period? Your immune system responds to your natural cycle. It's suppressed during ovulation and then comes roaring back when your period is about to start. People with more period pain tend to have a stronger immune response, and this means more inflammation:

 

Semaine is formulated with the perfect blend of nine super-powered plant extracts that work together to restore balance to your body. Your body is a complex system, and the inflammation that increases during your period is the result of interconnected cascades, not just a single change. Instead of reducing pain by sledgehammering a single pathway (like you can do with pharmaceuticals), Semaine uses multiple plant extracts that have been shown to affect distinct pathways. By using the synergies that come from combining plant-based extracts, Semaine helps you feel better than if you just took megadoses of a single ingredient.

Semaine’s formulation is the result of more than a year of intense research and testing. To decide what biological pathways we wanted to address, we pored over hundreds of scientific papers on period pain and the connections between IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome), inflammation, and pain. Then we researched dozens of different plant extracts, vitamins, and minerals to determine which had strong scientific evidence for specific mechanisms of action and also analyzed the quality of their clinical or pre-clinical trial data. Then we narrowed the list to select supplements that could work synergistically with one another. 
Each ingredient has been expertly sourced so that it's the highest quality, most bio-available form for your body. Not all supplement ingredients are created equal, and we wanted to make sure that not only was the supply chain fully transparent, and our ingredients rigorously and repeatedly tested for purity, but that your body absorbs the supplements as much as possible. So, not only do we use the world’s first vegan vitamin D3, but we rely heavily on phytosome technology. Phytosomes encapsulate supplements in sunflower lipids and are up to 30 times more bioavailable to your body—making sure your body gets the support it needs.

For a detailed list of the science and clinical trials behind each ingredient, please visit our FAQ page.

Semaine (which means ""week"" in French) is for the week of your period. We know everyone's period is different, but long or short, on hormonal birth control or not, Semaine works best when it's taken a few days before the start of your first full day of bleeding. This allows the anti-inflammatory ingredients to do their work before the worst of your inflammation starts.
Take two pills in the morning (with or without food) and two pills in the evening. Do this for seven days once a month, or whenever you have your period.



We exhaustively searched through hundreds of suppliers to make sure we could find those that passed our exacting quality, sustainability, and transparency standards. We wanted to make sure that not only could we track the supply chain the whole way, but also make sure suppliers use rigorous testing methods to ensure purity. We're grounded in science, and we only want to partner and source from companies that have similarly rigorous standards. For example, we use the world's first vegan vitamin D3 and use innovative approaches to make sure our supplements are maximally bioavailable (i.e., your body can absorb them). By joining extracts with sunflower lipids, the phytosome supplements we use are absorbed up to 30 times better than the raw ingredients.
The suppliers who meet our standards also tend to protect their reputation by branding their ingredients. Because of this, we only use “branded” ingredients. This is our list of “branded” ingredients: Sensoril® ashwagandha, Casperome® boswellia, Meriva® curcumin, Green Select® phytosome, Sucrosomial® magnesium, Quercefit® quercetin, Rexatrol® resveratrol, Siliphos® silymarin, Vitashine™ vegan vitamin D3.

Whenever we met with doctors and other health practitioners, we weren't given a lot of options to combat our pain.

<h1>Nice pictures, but whats the go?</h1>
<p>Everyone loves the beach. But nobody loves having a wet, sandy towel and car on the way home. This is where the concept for the Sandusa Beach Towel originated.</p>
<p>My name is Baz Brown and I'm from the Gold Coast, Australia.</p>
<p>Like many Australians I spend a lot of time at the beach, endlessly frustrated by the constant stream of sand flinging from my towel or scratching into my car seats. I had to find a way to leave the sand at the beach once and for all.</p>
<p>That's why I created the Sandusa - a comfortable towel that is both sand-resistant and waterproof.</p>

<p> </p>
<h1><span>Is the Sandusa sandproof?</span></h1>
<p>We are not magicians. If you throw sand on the Sandusa it is going to get covered in sand. The toweling side is just like a normal towel so if you get sand on that side and stomp all over it, it will remain sandy like a regular towel would.</p>
<p>The underside is where the magic happens (ok, maybe we are a little bit like magicians). The Base is nylon which has short “loop-less” fibres which sand does not remain stuck to. See images below: both images were taken after a few hours at the beach.The first image is a normal beach towel. The second is a Sandusa.</p>

<p>Unlike the regular towel, the Sandusa’s underside is effectively sand-free. </p>
<h1><span>Is the Sandusa waterproof?</span></h1>
<p>Yes, you heard right. A waterproof towel. What?How?Where? Between the absorbent towel and the nylon backing is a thin layer of waterproof material. You’re welcome.</p>
<h1>If I get stuck in sinking sand will the Sandusa save me?</h1>
<p>Initial testing suggests yes. However if it happens to anyone, let us know how you went?</p>
<h1>Is the Sandusa machine washable and dryable?</h1>
<p>The Sandusa is machine washable. You can use a dryer however regular drying degrades the materials in the towel, shortening the lifespan of the product. Not to mention the environmental effects. So we suggest using the sun to dry your towel.</p>
<h1>What other ways can I use the Sandusa?</h1>
<p>I’m not your mother but here are a few of our favourite suggestions (let us know if you have any others):</p>
<ul>

</div>","Sniff Relief is a self-heating face mask that warms up your nose and surrounding areas to relieve sinus pressure and alleviate the symptoms of runny noses.
Sniff Relief is super-comfortable and designed to be used while you’re awake or sleeping.




















This self-heating mask naturally unblocks your sinuses and alleviates pressure.
Where medicine can take hours to kick in,
Sniff Relief gives you fast, effective relief.





No more pills. No more nasal sprays... Seriously, stop jamming things up your nose.
Sweet relief from sinus pressure and runny noses, the natural way!















The adjustable elastic strap allows the mask to stay comfortably in place while the mendable nose bridge is designed to mold around the shape of your nose giving you a snug and custom fit.
The fleece masks don’t aggravate and comes in 3 different sizes with an adjustable strap to fit comfortably.





Use the remote to adjust your Sniff Relief settings. The 4 buttons on the remote allows you to power your mask on or off, change the display settings, or increase/decrease the temperature.








































We created Sniff Relief because we suffered from sinus pain and we couldn’t find anything that really worked. This is the real deal.

<p>I have been so busy since Hurricane Carlotta hit Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca on June 15th organizing around the clock an online campaign to raise emergency hurricane relief help for the Lifeguard Service of Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca to rebuild 8 lifeguard towers that were wiped out by Hurricane Carlotta. Oaxaca is the poorest state in Mexico and Puerto Escondido is a surfing destination in a very poor rual farm area of southern Mexico. They don't have the funds to rebuild the 8 lifeguard towers for Playa Zicatela where the surfers visit from all over the world to surf Zicatela Beach.</p>
<p>
</p><div class=""mhl"">The international surfing community that visits Puerto Escondido is the backbone and sustenance of Puerto Escondido's economy and without the lifeguard towers re-established soon for the international surfers to keep visiting Puerto Escondido, the people of Puerto will suffer in poverty for a long time to come. The lifeguard service is the most important public service down there and they need our help to get their towers re-established as soon as possible so the internatonal surfers will start returning to stimulate Puerto's economy that was severely damaged by Hurricane Carlotta's impact. <br/><br/>Hurricane Carlotta was a category 2 hurricane and she wiped out a lot of homes, schools, family businesses, and all 8 of the Zicatela Beach lifeguard towers. I created and organized this fundraising campaign to help the people of Puerto and the international surfing community re-establish the Puerto Escondido Lifeguard Service Watch Towers on Zicatela Beach.<p></p>

<p>Here are some photo's taken by <span class=""fbPhotoCaptionText"">Urska Milavec</span>, the lifeguard captain's wife, the morning after Carlotta hit. This is how they found the lifeguard towers.</p>

<p> </p></div>","Hurricane Carlotta Emergency Relief Fund to Re-Establish the Zicatela Beach Towers.
I have been so busy since Hurricane Carlotta hit Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca on June 15th organizing around the clock an online campaign to raise emergency hurricane relief help for the Lifeguard Service of Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca to rebuild 8 lifeguard towers that were wiped out by Hurricane Carlotta. Oaxaca is the poorest state in Mexico and Puerto Escondido is a surfing destination in a very poor rual farm area of southern Mexico. They don't have the funds to rebuild the 8 lifeguard towers for Playa Zicatela where the surfers visit from all over the world to surf Zicatela Beach.

The international surfing community that visits Puerto Escondido is the backbone and sustenance of Puerto Escondido's economy and without the lifeguard towers re-established soon for the international surfers to keep visiting Puerto Escondido, the people of Puerto will suffer in poverty for a long time to come. The lifeguard service is the most important public service down there and they need our help to get their towers re-established as soon as possible so the internatonal surfers will start returning to stimulate Puerto's economy that was severely damaged by Hurricane Carlotta's impact. Hurricane Carlotta was a category 2 hurricane and she wiped out a lot of homes, schools, family businesses, and all 8 of the Zicatela Beach lifeguard towers. I created and organized this fundraising campaign to help the people of Puerto and the international surfing community re-establish the Puerto Escondido Lifeguard Service Watch Towers on Zicatela Beach.

Here are some photo's taken by Urska Milavec, the lifeguard captain's wife, the morning after Carlotta hit. This is how they found the lifeguard towers.

Mission Statement:
Please help Hurricane Carlotta Emergency Relief Fund to Re-Establish the Zicatela Beach Towers keep Playa Zicatela safe for everybody by helping us fund the onsite construction costs of rebuilding the Zicatela Towers! 
 
On June 15,2012 Hurricane Carlotta wiped out all 8 of the Puerto Escondido lifeguard watch towers on Playa Zicatela, a world class surfing destination.  
 
Our mission is to join together with all our combined strengths in the international surfing community to quickly rebuild the 8 Zicatela Beach Towers that were destroyed by Hurricane Carlotta. These Zicatela Beach lifeguard towers save lives in one of the most heaviest and most deadliest monster waves in the world, the Mexican Pipeline! Some of these waves have been known to reach 40-50 feet during the big wave season when the big wave surfers come from all over the world to challenge themselves and inspire others to live fearlessly and to push yourself beyond your limits. 
 
Without the Zicatela Towers, visibility of surfers and swimmers is at only 40% at Zicatela Beach, and 40% is just not enough to save endangered lives when in trouble. Please help us keep Puerto's surfing community safe out there in Zicatela!
 
We need to raise $5,000 to quickly rebuild a few state of emergency towers to keep the swimmers and surfers safe at Zicatela Beach. Right now they have no lifeguard towers up and there are swimmers and surfers out there in the water without proper lifeguard watch tower protection in a dangerous pipeline and lives will be lost if we do not resurrect these lifeguard watch towers quickly.
 
Whatever you can give will help a lot! $5, $10, $20, it all helps!

educational lectures and activities to raise awareness for Men’s Health. Over 40 distinguished speakers from over 30 prominent universities and institutions from all over the globe are participating.DRIVE PATHWAYThe purpose of the Drive for Men’s Health marathon is to
increase awareness of men’s health issues and to encourage men to make their
health a priority.  Throughout the
country, men are encouraged to get better sleep, quit smoking, be more active,
eat healthy and decrease stress. As Urologists, Dr. Brahmbhatt and Dr.
Parekattil plan to also increase awareness of chronic groin or testicular pain,
post-vasectomy pain, post-inguinal hernia pain and male infertility.
This marathon is also geared at raising funds to help
support two specific initiatives:1) A research initiative for a novel genetic
study on men with chronic groin or testicular pain, post-vasectomy pain and
post-inguinal hernia pain. The PUR clinic is trying to assess if there may be
any genetic abnormalities that could explain why some men suffer from these
conditions.
2) A scholarship fund to cover tuition costs for students
aspiring to attend the new Florida Polytechnic University, Lakeland, Florida.
This is a one of kind engineering school geared at developing engineers for the
future. The school uses industry and medical partnerships/internships as part of an
immersive real-life training model so that all graduates would be engaged in
solving current day problems during their entire educational experience. For

<p>We created a fast easy convenient method to apply the season
to your cast iron cookware. Our design incorporates a small, handled,
seasoning device that rests in a spring-loaded seasoning holding cup. The

pad, shaped to fit the contour of the cast iron pan, is always ready with the
perfect amount of seasoning that can be quickly, easily, conveniently, and

<p>Cast iron users need an innovative solution to a process
that we've been doing for years and years.  After cooking with cast iron
cookware each person needs to wash, dry, and season after each use.  We
season because it preserves that hard, smooth, impermeable non-stick
surface that we all love.  Until now the only solution to seasoning and
wiping our pans has been with ""paper towels"" and trusted oil,
shortening, salt, pepper, or (whichever family secret you are putting to use).  </p>

A modern dish that sits next to your stove, each time after washing/drying your iron pan, an oil pad is always ready for you to conveniently season. Need more oil?

I've been listening to your CD for about the last 5 nights just before I
go to bed. It's actually working!</p>
<p>I had a CT scan
done on my head as I was having headaches daily for a few weeks. Anyway, it
came out fine but they did discover an inflamed nerve that was causing the
headaches/earaches.</p>
<p>Anyway I'm taking
Naproxen and it's helping, but I think your music is doing
even more!! I find I'm having restful sleeps and not thinking of
anything!! It's pretty crazy how the chimes, etc. sound just as if you're
standing over me!! Thank you for the CD! I've given out the 3 extra you gave me”.</p>

stating the obvious…fantastic journey!!! </p>
<p>Cheryl,
you had so lovingly told all of us, how happy you were that we were there; well
tenfold at both of you…as we wouldn't be there but for the two of you.</p>
<p>The
sound is still, as I write to you, resounding in my ‘cells’. One would commonly
think in their head, but no – it has gone cellular. My body is still
responding.</p>
<p>The
play of sound, within the play-of-dance the two of you do, is not unlike
the intermingling nuances found in the best of wine. Whether it is received
from the bowls, drums, gongs – each at their own time, or the specific
combinations you intuitively play – are felt in the deepest part of my being,
from head to toe. There are so many times that the particular tones are
played and my-self go out, somewhere – then back.</p>
<p>At
the end of the first session; I didn't get up right away because my third eye
was wide open and looking face to face with an eagle, up close and personal. I
feel renewed, and relaxed – but it goes much deeper than the physical – to a
place where there are no words”.</p>

“I thought you should know that
I've been listening to your CD for about the last 5 nights just before I
go to bed. It's actually working!
I had a CT scan
done on my head as I was having headaches daily for a few weeks. Anyway, it
came out fine but they did discover an inflamed nerve that was causing the
headaches/earaches.
Anyway I'm taking
Naproxen and it's helping, but I think your music is doing
even more!! I find I'm having restful sleeps and not thinking of
anything!! It's pretty crazy how the chimes, etc. sound just as if you're
standing over me!! Thank you for the CD! I've given out the 3 extra you gave me”.

“Cheryl and Liz’s amazing
Sound Baths, set in the peacefulness of Liz's Spirit Yoga Studio were a magical
combination for the weekend retreat into self. I came away with insights on my
continued “road to self-discovery”.
Judy, Harrison
Hot Springs

“Well,
stating the obvious…fantastic journey!!! 
Cheryl,
you had so lovingly told all of us, how happy you were that we were there; well
tenfold at both of you…as we wouldn't be there but for the two of you.
The
sound is still, as I write to you, resounding in my ‘cells’. One would commonly
think in their head, but no – it has gone cellular. My body is still
responding.
The
play of sound, within the play-of-dance the two of you do, is not unlike
the intermingling nuances found in the best of wine. Whether it is received
from the bowls, drums, gongs – each at their own time, or the specific
combinations you intuitively play – are felt in the deepest part of my being,
from head to toe. There are so many times that the particular tones are
played and my-self go out, somewhere – then back.
At
the end of the first session; I didn't get up right away because my third eye
was wide open and looking face to face with an eagle, up close and personal. I
feel renewed, and relaxed – but it goes much deeper than the physical – to a
place where there are no words”.

<div>An opportunity has arisen to own a large house in Devon, UK and we need a large deposit to get a mortgage. </div>
<div>This is a not-for-profit community project which will not only offer people at cost alternative therapies, detox lifestyle and wellness education, but also jobs for many local therapists and an opportunity for global wellness guides to teach and offer retreats here. </div>
<div>We also intend to use the building and surrounding land to provide low carbon footprint and sustainability: Creating a market garden to grow greens and organic vegetables for our freshly pressed daily juices as well as buying locally sourced and ""happy"" produced for an on sight whole foods cafe.

damage to the skin and underlying tissue. Unrelieved pressure on the skin
squeezes tiny blood vessels, which supply the skin with nutrients and oxygen.
When the skin is starved of blood for too long, tissue dies and a pressure sore
forms. </p>
<p>Pressure sores commonly occur in the buttock, lower back
and hip region, but can form in any part of the body that has consistent
contact with a hard surface.</p><h3><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><h3></h3>

<h3>About The Inventor</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Flemming Dahl, from Denmark, is the inventor of the
ASEATCO system. This project started for Flemming in 1964. During a weekend off
from working on a sheep farm in rural New South Wales, Australia, Flemming
jumped into the Murrumbidgee River over the back of a friend. He hit the
bottom, head first. Flemming became paralysed from the waist down. It wasn't
long before Flemming confronted the dangers of pressure sores. In response, he
began developing the ASEATCO system. Out of his workshop in Esbjerg, Denmark,
Flemming has spent over four decades developing and tweaking the system.</p>

</div>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p></p>
<p>In order to produce a quantity of seats for
testing and trialling, new tooling, reflecting advances in plastic moulding
technology is needed. Almost half of your contribution will go toward new
tooling used to form the seats unique hydraulic pistons.</p>

<h3></h3>
<h3>How Big Is The Problem?</h3>
<p>There are over 6 million paralysed people in the world; an estimated 67 million people rely on wheelchairs, and hundreds of millions of elderly people experience diminished pain recognition and have limited range of movement -- all are at risk of pressure sores.</p>
<p>Currently the methods for preventing pressure sores are limited to: position changes, foam cushions, daily skin care, a nutritious diet and lifestyle changes. </p>
<h3>The Cost Of Pressure Sores</h3>
<p>In 2011 a resource paper published by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) delivered the following numbers:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/925194/files/20141012210426-Cost-Graphic.png?1413173066"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Who Is At Risk?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sedentary and immobile people.</li>
<li>Disabled &amp; handicapped people. </li>
<li>People suffering with chronic illnesses.</li>
<li>Elderly people with thin, delicate skin.</li>
<li>Anyone confined to a bed or chair for an
extended period.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<h4>Pressure Sores Are Graded to Four Levels:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Grade I – skin discolouration, usually red,
blue, purple or black.</li>
<li>Grade II – some skin loss or damage to the top-most skin layers. </li>
<li>Grade III – necrosis (death) or damage to the
skin patch, limited to skin layers.</li>
<li>Grade IV – necrosis (death) or damage to the
skin patch and underlying structures, such as tendon, joint or bone.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/862998/files/20140916223243-pressure-sore-stages-640.jpg?1410931963"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>
</div><div>
<p>The dangers associated with pressure sores are amplified
by the fact that people with limited pain sensation can be unaware that they're
suffering from pressure sores -- and therefore go untreated. Constant
supervision is required. This responsibility often falls on nurses to turn
patients and stimulate blood flow.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Untreated pressure sores can lead to a variety of conditions, including:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Sepsis – bacteria entering the bloodstream.</li>
<li>Cellulitis – inflammation of body tissue,
causing swelling and redness. </li>
<li>Bone and joint infections.</li>
<li>Abscess – a collection of pus.<br/>
</li>
<li>Cancer – squamous cell carcinoma.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>Challenges - How Can I Get A Seat?</h3>
<p>If you or someone you love could benefit from an
ASEATCO seat we want to provide one for you, but in order to get the product to
market we need the ASEATCO system to be trailed and approved for use. This is
an extensive and expensive process.</p>

<h3>About The Company</h3>
<p>ASEATCO is a privately held Danish company, formed in 2009. </p>
<p>Flemming met Melbourne based engineer, David Pinches in 1977 when David was travelling
through Denmark. David has stayed in
contact with Flemming throughout his journey as a friend, mentor and advisor. In 2009, David became an investor in ASEATCO, helping to maintain updates to prototypes and ensuring that Flemming's patent was maintained.</p>
<p>New tooling for the seats has been designed by Flemming with assistance from David. Manufacturing will take place in Denmark and the seats will be assembled under Flemming's supervision.<br/></p>

</div></div>","ASEATCO is a seat system that helps to prevent pressure sores by relieving pressure and optimising blood circulation for sedentary and immobile people.
Pressure SoresPressure sores form as a result of
damage to the skin and underlying tissue. Unrelieved pressure on the skin
squeezes tiny blood vessels, which supply the skin with nutrients and oxygen.
When the skin is starved of blood for too long, tissue dies and a pressure sore
forms. 
Pressure sores commonly occur in the buttock, lower back
and hip region, but can form in any part of the body that has consistent
contact with a hard surface.


The Invention


The ASEATCO seat operates on plungers which move up and down on a predetermined cycle time to relieve pressure and optimise the conditions for increased blood circulation.





Seat Specifications




252 hydraulic pistons distribute weight evenly across the seat.
The device fits all standard wheelchair configurations. 
Programmed pistons direct blood toward the heart.
Connects to a standard power outlet. Fully charged, the seat delivers up to 80 hours of operating time.
Suitable for people of all sizes.



About The Inventor

Flemming Dahl, from Denmark, is the inventor of the
ASEATCO system. This project started for Flemming in 1964. During a weekend off
from working on a sheep farm in rural New South Wales, Australia, Flemming
jumped into the Murrumbidgee River over the back of a friend. He hit the
bottom, head first. Flemming became paralysed from the waist down. It wasn't
long before Flemming confronted the dangers of pressure sores. In response, he
began developing the ASEATCO system. Out of his workshop in Esbjerg, Denmark,
Flemming has spent over four decades developing and tweaking the system.




What We Need

In order to produce a quantity of seats for
testing and trialling, new tooling, reflecting advances in plastic moulding
technology is needed. Almost half of your contribution will go toward new
tooling used to form the seats unique hydraulic pistons.


Our Goals


How Big Is The Problem?
There are over 6 million paralysed people in the world; an estimated 67 million people rely on wheelchairs, and hundreds of millions of elderly people experience diminished pain recognition and have limited range of movement -- all are at risk of pressure sores.
Currently the methods for preventing pressure sores are limited to: position changes, foam cushions, daily skin care, a nutritious diet and lifestyle changes. 
The Cost Of Pressure Sores
In 2011 a resource paper published by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) delivered the following numbers:

Who Is At Risk?

Sedentary and immobile people.
Disabled & handicapped people. 
People suffering with chronic illnesses.
Elderly people with thin, delicate skin.
Anyone confined to a bed or chair for an
extended period.


Pressure Sores Are Graded to Four Levels:

Grade I – skin discolouration, usually red,
blue, purple or black.
Grade II – some skin loss or damage to the top-most skin layers. 
Grade III – necrosis (death) or damage to the
skin patch, limited to skin layers.
Grade IV – necrosis (death) or damage to the
skin patch and underlying structures, such as tendon, joint or bone.




The dangers associated with pressure sores are amplified
by the fact that people with limited pain sensation can be unaware that they're
suffering from pressure sores -- and therefore go untreated. Constant
supervision is required. This responsibility often falls on nurses to turn
patients and stimulate blood flow.

Untreated pressure sores can lead to a variety of conditions, including:

Sepsis – bacteria entering the bloodstream.
Cellulitis – inflammation of body tissue,
causing swelling and redness. 
Bone and joint infections.
Abscess – a collection of pus.

Cancer – squamous cell carcinoma.


Challenges - How Can I Get A Seat?
If you or someone you love could benefit from an
ASEATCO seat we want to provide one for you, but in order to get the product to
market we need the ASEATCO system to be trailed and approved for use. This is
an extensive and expensive process.











About The Company
ASEATCO is a privately held Danish company, formed in 2009. 
Flemming met Melbourne based engineer, David Pinches in 1977 when David was travelling
through Denmark. David has stayed in
contact with Flemming throughout his journey as a friend, mentor and advisor. In 2009, David became an investor in ASEATCO, helping to maintain updates to prototypes and ensuring that Flemming's patent was maintained.
New tooling for the seats has been designed by Flemming with assistance from David. Manufacturing will take place in Denmark and the seats will be assembled under Flemming's supervision.

<p><b>Thank you to everyone who has donated to make this campaign such a huge success! We are so excited we have hit our target when we still have a WHOLE WEEK to go! Fantastic work everyone.</b></p>
<p>But we don't want to give up here. $30,000 secures full funding for 15 patients and their carers. This if half our ideal study number. We know with such a fantastic crowd of supporters, we can raise the funds to support a few more valuable patients...</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>Each patient costs about $2000 to bring to the center if they require a carer. In just 5 weeks you raised enough money to fully fund 15 patients. This means you funded 3 patients each week! With one week left, we think we should aim to raise the funds for 3 more!</p>
<p><b>Every patient who takes part in the study is so important to us</b>, and the more patients we can offer to fully fund, the better the experience will be for them. We want to make this research as easy as possible for our patients as they donate their time to help us cure Black Bone Disease.</p>
<p>We are so grateful for what you have done so far. Please help us one more time as we push through our final week, and try to fund a few more crucial patients!</p>

<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">So, what is Black Bone Disease?</b></p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;""></b></p>
<p>Black Bone Disease is also known as alkaptonuria, or AKU. It is a genetic disease caused by a build-up of acid in the body which attacks bones and other tissue, turning it black and brittle. This causes severe joint damage in patients, and can even result in heart disease.</p>
<p>Black Bone Disease was the first genetic disease to be discovered more than 110 years ago. It still has no approved treatment. We want to change this.</p>
<p><b>About us</b></p>
<p>We are the AKU Society; a charity working to support patients with Black Bone Disease. As a patient group we work very closely with and for our patients. Black Bone Disease is very rare, so we work hard to help identify patients and provide them with the information they need about their disease.</p>
<p>Our aim is to improve the level of care and the quality of life for all patients with Black Bone Disease. Driving research is a big part of this patient support. We want to find a treatment that works for patients. Being involved in research and clinical trials ensures they are patient focused, and are always run for the benefit of the patient.</p>

<br/><p>Rosie is a student in her early twenties. She was diagnosed with Black Bone Disease when she was a baby.

<p><b>The story so far</b></p>
<p>We are currently helping to fund a big <b>clinical trial</b> across Europe to test a promising drug for Black Bone Disease. This drug is called nitisinone, and, if it is given at the correct age, it could <b>prevent all of the damage</b> caused by the disease. For patients with Black Bone Disease, this would be life changing.</p>
<p>Our success so far is all thanks to your generosity. In 2013 we launched our first crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo to <b><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/cure-black-bone-disease/x/7074343"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cure Black Bone Disease</a></b>. This campaign was an incredible success, and it is thanks to you we have been able to recruit and support so many patients.</p>
<p>With your help we have been able to pay for patient travel and accommodation, and provide consistent support to patients before, throughout, and after each visit. <span style=""color: rgb(0,0,0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We have just finished recruitment for our big trial, with over 135 patients taking part.

<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">However, there is still one thing we really need to find out. What is the best age to give this drug? Given too early and the drug could potentially cause side effects harmful to children. Given too late, and the debilitating damage caused by Black Bone Disease will have already set in. This is the next stage of our research.</span></p>

<p>Unfortunately, symptoms get more serious with time. Patients start to experience joint pain as young adults, and this gets
progressively worse. They can soon develop crippling back and joint pain,
resulting in many patients having to give up work. Older patients may need
serious operations to replace or fuse their broken joints. <span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Over time, Black Bone Disease leaves patients severely disabled.</span></p>

Our research teams still don’t know exactly how
the disease changes over a patient’s lifetime. That’s why we need to secure funding for a new clinical study called SOFIA. This study will compare groups of patients from a range of different age groups to better
understand the disease and target the best age to begin treatment.</div>

<p>Our SOFIA study will recruit patients from across Europe. Our researchers will compare these groups to assess when damage really begins. They will do this using a variety of tools, from assessing how patients walk, to taking blood, urine and ear cartilage samples.</p>
<p>This work should help them understand if significant damage is present in young patients in an invisible way. This is very important- if we give the drug early enough, we may be able to prevent patients from ever experiencing any of the painful symptoms of AKU. Given at the correct age, we can minimise the impacts of potential side effects in growing children.</p>

<p><b>Ayúdanos a curar la alcaptonuria: El tiempo se acaba</b></p>
<p><b>La alcaptonuria es una enfermedad muy rara, con poco más de un millar de casos diagnosticados en todo el mundo. Necesitamos tu ayuda para reunir a pacientes de toda Europa y desarrollar un ensayo clínico que nos permita averiguar cuál es la mejor edad para iniciar el tratamiento con Nitisona.</b></p>
<p><b>¿En qué consiste la alcaptonuria?</b></p>
<p>La alcaptonuria es una enfermedad genética que hace que se acumule ácido en el organismo, el cual ataca al esqueleto y a otros tejidos, volviendo los huesos oscuros y frágiles. Esto causa daños severos en las articulaciones de los pacientes y puede incluso producir enfermedades cardiacas.</p>
<p>La alcaptonuria fue la primera enfermedad genética que se descubrió, hace ya más de 110 años. Todavía no tiene un tratamiento aprobado. Queremos cambiar esta situación.</p>
<p><b>Sobre nosotros</b></p>
<p>Somos la Asociación de la Alcaptonuria (AKU Society, en inglés), una organización benéfica de ayuda a los pacientes afectados por la alcaptonuria. Como asociación de pacientes, trabajamos muy estrechamente con y para nuestros pacientes. La alcaptonuria es una enfermedad muy rara, así que trabajamos duramente para identificar a los pacientes y proporcionarles la información que necesitan sobre su enfermedad. </p>
<p>Nuestro objetivo es mejorar el tratamiento y la calidad de vida de todos los pacientes afectados por la alcaptonuria. El impulso a la investigación es una parte my importante de la labor que hacemos por los pacientes. Al implicarnos en la investigación y en los ensayos clínicos, nos aseguramos de que se centren en el paciente y que su objetivo sea siempre el beneficio del paciente.</p>
<p><b>La historia de Rosie</b></p>
<p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1224892/files/20150216014915-Rosie4.jpg?1424080155"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></b></p>
<p>Rosie es una estudiante de veintipocos años. Fue diagnosticada de alcaptonuria cuando era un bebé. Su padre, Ian, es médico de familia y Rosie quiere seguir sus pasos; está estudiando medicina en la universidad. A pesar de sus conocimientos médicos, Ian se preocupó mucho cuando a Rosie le diagnosticaron la enfermedad con 18 meses.</p>
<p><b>""Cuando nos dieron el diagnóstico fue terriblemente traumático para nosotros, porque en aquel entonces no existía internet, no existía la Asociación de la Alcaptonuria y no existía ningún tratamiento.""</b> Ian, padre de Rosie.</p>
<p>Ian sabía que, sin ayuda, su hija iría desarrollando paulatinamente problemas en las articulaciones y la columna vertebral durante toda su vida, y acabaría por necesitar prótesis y sufrir de una discapacidad severa. Incluso podría padecer problemas más serios, por ejemplo, del corazón.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1224894/files/20150216015008-Rosie_Ian.jpg?1424080208"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1224898/files/20150216015035-RosieFamily.jpg?1424080235"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>Afortunadamente para Rosie, ahora contamos con un fármaco que puede ayudarla, a ella y a otros pacientes como ella, evitando que se produzcan todos los síntomas debilitantes de la alcaptonuria. Se llama Nitisona.</p>
<p><b>""Sería increíblemente importante para mí, y para otros pacientes como yo, saber cuál es el mejor momento para empezar con la Nitisona, para evitar que desarrollemos los problemas más graves, incluyendo la artritis."" </b>Rosie, paciente de alcaptonuria.</p>
<p><b>Dónde estamos hoy</b></p>
<p>En estos momentos, estamos contribuyendo a financiar un gran ensayo clínico a escala europea para probar un fármaco muy prometedor para el tratamiento de la alcaptonuria. Este fármaco se llama Nitisona y, si se empieza a administrar a la edad adecuada, podría prevenir todos los daños causados por la enfermedad. Esto podría transformar las vidas de los pacientes que sufren de alcaptonuria.</p>
<p>Todo lo que hemos conseguido hasta la fecha ha sido gracias a la generosidad de los donantes. En 2013, lanzamos nuestra primera campaña de micromecenazgo (crowdfunding) en la plataforma Indiegogo para curar la alcaptonuria. Esta campaña tuvo un éxito increíble, y gracias a la ayuda recibida hemos logrado reclutar y apoyar a muchos pacientes.</p>
<p>Con la ayuda de los donantes, hemos podido costear los gastos de viaje y alojamiento de los pacientes, y proporcionarles apoyo constante, antes, durante y después de cada visita. Acabamos de terminar de reclutar los pacientes necesarios para un gran ensayo clínico, en el que participarán más de 135 afectados por la alcaptonuria. ¡Un logro fantástico para una enfermedad tan rara!</p>
<p>Sin embargo, aún queda algo muy importante por averiguar. ¿Cuál es la mejor edad para empezar a administrar la Nitisona? Si se empieza demasiado pronto, el fármaco podría tener efectos secundarios dañinos en los niños. Si se empieza demasiado tarde, los daños debilitantes causados por la enfermedad pueden haberse instalado ya. Este es el próximo paso que queremos dar en nuestra investigación.</p>
<p><b>El próximo paso</b></p>
<p>La alcaptonuria afecta a los pacientes durante toda su vida. Desde una edad muy temprana, su orina es de color oscuro y mancha los pañales. De niños, puede que tengan cera oscura en los oídos, y que su sudor también sea oscuro. Este tipo de síntomas son aparentemente inofensivos al principio, y los niños afectados pueden parecer perfectamente sanos.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1224984/files/20150216022832-Jess.jpg?1424082512"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p>Jess es madre de un pequeño con alcaptonuria. Se dio cuenta por primera vez de algo iba mal cuando vio que la orina de su hijo estaba manchada de rojo oscuro. Después de consultar a varios médicos y buscando información en internet, acabó por conseguir que le hicieran a su pequeño el test de la alcaptonuria. Aunque el niño hoy está sano, Jess está preocupada por el impacto que la enfermedad puede llegar a tener en la vida de su hijo.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1283326/files/20150310052353-footy2.JPG?1425990233"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p><b>""Como madre, es muy duro saber que mi pequeño tiene esta enfermedad. Hoy es un niño feliz y sano, pero puede que el daño haya empezado ya, aunque sea invisible, y por eso es tan importante saber cuál es la edad correcta para empezar a tomar este fármaco.""</b></p>
<p>Desgraciadamente, los síntomas se agravan con el tiempo. Los pacientes empiezan a experimentar dolores articulares en su juventud y esta situación empeora progresivamente. Pronto pueden desarrollar dolores discapacitantes en la espalda y las articulaciones, lo que obliga a muchos pacientes a dejar de trabajar. Los pacientes mayores pueden necesitar operaciones importantes para reemplazar o fusionar sus articulaciones dañadas. Con el tiempo, la alcaptonuria es causa de discapacidad severa.</p>
<p>Nuestros equipos de investigación todavía no saben exactamente cómo evoluciona la enfermedad a lo largo de la vida del paciente. Por eso necesitamos financiación para un nuevo ensayo clínico llamado SOFIA. Este estudio comparará grupos de pacientes de diferentes edades para entender mejor la enfermedad e identificar la edad idónea para iniciar el tratamiento.</p>
<p><b>“Es verdaderamente crucial que averigüemos la edad a la que empezar a tratar con Nitisona, para evitar que los pacientes desarrollen esos síntomas debilitantes.”</b> Ann, paciente de alcaptonuria.</p>
<p>El estudio SOFIA reclutará pacientes de toda Europa. Nuestros investigadores compararán los diferentes grupos de edad para valorar cuándo empieza a producirse el daño. Lo harán mediante una serie de herramientas, desde la evaluación de la marcha de los pacientes (cómo caminan), hasta el análisis de muestras de sangre, orina y cartílago auricular.</p>
<p>Este trabajo les ayudará a entender si ya existen daños significativos en pacientes jóvenes, aunque no sean visibles. Es muy importante saberlo, porque si les damos el fármaco lo suficientemente pronto, puede que logremos evitar que los pacientes desarrollen los dolorosos síntomas de la alcaptonuria. Y al administrarlo a la edad correcta, podremos evitar los efectos secundarios que pueden ocurrir en niños que aún están creciendo.</p>
<p><b>“Si pudiéramos saber que le estamos dando el medicamento en el momento adecuado, si pudiéramos evitar que empezaran los síntomas de esta horrible enfermedad, estaríamos felices. Estaríamos locos de alegría.” </b>Jess, madre de un paciente de alcaptonuria.</p>
<p><b>Necesitamos tu ayuda</b></p>
<p>La alcaptonuria es una enfermedad muy rara y necesitamos tu ayuda para reunir a pacientes de toda Europa para recopilar todos los datos que podamos y averiguar cuál es la mejor edad para empezar a tomar Nitisona.</p>
<p><b>Aquí es donde empieza tu papel</b></p>
<p>Ya hemos conseguido reunir el dinero necesario para costear la parte médica y ahora necesitamos 30.000 dólares para el apoyo a los pacientes. Esta cantidad nos permitirá dar apoyo completo a unos 15 pacientes para que puedan participar en el ensayo.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1325403/files/20150325100519-Infographic_of_spending_spanish.jpg?1427303119"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<b>Die sogenannte Black Bone Disease ist mit weniger als 100 Patienten in Großbritannien und knapp 1000 diagnostizierten Fällen weltweit eine sehr seltene Erkrankung.  Wir brauchen Ihre Hilfe, um Patienten aus ganz Europa zusammen zu bringen, damit möglichst viele Daten gesammelt werden können, um das beste Alter für den Beginn einer Behandlung mit Nitisinon zu ermitteln.</b><br/>
</div>
<div>
<b></b><p><b>Was ist die “Black Bone Disease”?</b></p>
<p>Die ""Black Bone Disease“ ist auch bekannt als Alkaptonurie oder AKU. Es ist eine genetische Erkrankung, die durch eine Ansammlung von Säuren im Körper verursacht wird, wodurch die Knochen und andere Gewebe angegriffen werden, indem sie schwarz und brüchig werden. Das führt zu schwerwiegenden Gelenkschädigungen und kann sogar eine Herzerkrankung zur Folge haben.</p>
<p>Die Alkaptonurie war die erste genetische Erkrankung, die – vor mehr als 110 Jahren – entdeckt wurde. Für diese Krankheit gibt es bis dato keine zugelassene Behandlung. Wir möchten das ändern.</p>
<p><b>Über uns</b></p>
<p>Wir sind die AKU-Gesellschaft, eine wohltätige Vereinigung, die Patienten mit Alkaptonurie unterstützt. Als Patientengruppierung sind wir für unsere Patienten da und arbeiten sehr eng mit ihnen zusammen. Da Alkaptonurie eine sehr seltene Erkrankung ist, arbeiten wir hart daran, bei der Identifizierung der Patienten zu helfen und diese mit den notwendigen Informationen über ihre Krankheit zu versorgen.</p>
<p>Unser Ziel ist es, das Versorgungsniveau und die Lebensqualität aller Patienten mit Alkaptonurie zu verbessern. Die Unterstützung der Patienten besteht zum Großteil darin, die Forschung voranzutreiben. Wir wollen eine Behandlung finden, die für die Patienten funktioniert. Durch unsere Beteiligung an der Forschung und den klinischen Studien wird sichergestellt, dass die Patienten im Fokus stehen und dass die Studien immer zum Nutzen der Patienten durchgeführt werden.</p>

<p><b>Die Geschichte von Rosie</b></p>
<p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1224892/files/20150216014915-Rosie4.jpg?1424080155"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></b></p>
<p>Rosie ist eine Studentin Anfang zwanzig. Sie wurde mit Alkaptonurie diagnostiziert, als sie ein Baby war. Ihr Vater, Ian, ist Allgemeinmediziner und Rosie tritt in seine Fußstapfen, indem sie Medizin studiert. Trotz seines medizinischen Hintergrundes war Ian sehr beunruhigt, als Rosie erstmalig im Alter von 18 Monaten mit Alkaptonurie diagnostiziert wurde.</p>
<p><b>“Als wir die Diagnose erhielten, wurden wir mehr oder weniger im Kreis geschickt, da es zu dieser Zeit noch kein Internet, keine AKU-Gesellschaft und keine Behandlung gab“</b>, <i>so Rosies Vater Ian.</i></p>
<p>Er wusste, dass sich ohne Hilfe bei seiner Tochter im Laufe ihres Lebens langsam Gelenks- und Wirbelsäulenprobleme entwickeln würden, was zu Gelenksoperationen und schwerer Behinderung führen würde. Die noch schlimmere Probleme einer Herzerkrankung stellen eine weitere Befürchtung dar.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1224894/files/20150216015008-Rosie_Ian.jpg?1424080208"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<br/><p>Glücklicherweise haben wir jetzt ein Arzneimittel, das verhindern könnte, dass es bei Rosie und anderen Patienten wie sie jemals zu irgendwelchen Behinderungen durch die Alkaptonurie kommen wird. Dieses Arzneimittel heißt Nitisinon.</p>
<p><b>“Für mich und andere Patienten wie mich wäre es unglaublich wichtig zu wissen, wann der beste Zeitpunkt ist, um mit Nitisinon zu beginnen, damit die schwerwiegendere Erscheinungsbilder der Erkrankung, einschließlich Arthritis, verhindert werden können.“</b> <i>Rosie, junge Alkaptonurie-Patientin</i></p>
<p><b>Die Geschichte bisher </b></p>
<p>Derzeit helfen wir bei der Finanzierung einer großen,europaweiten klinischen Studie zur Untersuchung eines viel versprechenden Arzneimittels zur Behandlung der Alkaptonurie. Dieses Arzneimittel heißt Nitisinon und, wenn es im richtigen Alter gegeben wird, könnte es sämtliche Schädigungen, die durch diese Erkrankung verursacht werden, verhindern. Das würde das Leben von Patienten mit Alkaptonurie verändern.</p>
<p>Ihrer Großzügigkeit verdanken wir unseren bisherigen Erfolg. 2013 starteten wir unsere erste sogenannte Crowdfunding-Kampagne, Cure Black Bone Disease, auf Indiegogo. Diese Kampagne war ein unglaublicher Erfolg und wir verdanken es Ihnen, dass wir so viele Patienten rekrutieren und unterstützen konnten. </p>
<p>Mit Ihrer Hilfe konnten wir die Reise- und Aufenthaltskosten der Patienten abdecken und ihnen vor, während und nach jeder Kontrolle kontinuierlich unterstützen. Gerade haben wir  die Rekrutierung unserer großen Studie, an der mehr als 135 Patienten teilnehmen, abgeschlossen. Bei solch einer seltenen Erkrankung ist das ein großartiges Ereignis!</p>
<p>Es gibt jedoch noch eine Frage, die wir unbedingt lösen müssen. Was ist das beste Alter, um mit diesem Arzneimittel zu beginnen? Wird es zu früh gegeben, könnte es möglicherweise  schädigende Nebenwirkungen bei den Kindern verursachen. Wird es zu spät gegeben, könnte die mit der Alkaptonurie verbundene Schädigung bereits eingesetzt haben. Damit befasst sich die nächste Phase unserer Forschung.</p>
<p><b>Die nächste Phase</b></p>
<p>Alkaptonurie beeinträchtigt die Patienten ein Leben lang. Bereits im frühen Alter hinterlässt der dunkel gefärbte Harn Flecken in den Windeln. Die Kinder können auch dunklen Ohrenschmalz und dunklen Schweiß haben. Solche Symptome erscheinen harmlos im jungen Alter und die Kinder sind oft vollkommen gesund.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1224984/files/20150216022832-Jess.jpg?1424082512"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>Jess ist die Mutter eines kleinen Jungen mit Alkaptonurie. Sie merkte erstmals, dass mit ihrem Sohn etwas nicht stimmte, als sie seinen dunkelrot verfärbten Harn sah. Nach mehreren Arztbesuchen und Nachforschungen im Internet ließ sie ihren kleinen Sohn auf Alkaptonurie testen. Obwohl er jetzt gesund ist, macht sich Jess darüber Sorgen, wie die Krankheit in Zukunft sein Leben beeinträchtigen könnte.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1283326/files/20150310052353-footy2.JPG?1425990233"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p><b>""Für mich als Mutter ist es wirklich schwierig, zu wissen, dass unser kleiner Sohn diese Krankheit hat. Er ist ein sehr glückliches und gesundes vierjähriges Kind, aber eine nicht sichtbare Schädigung könnte bei ihm bereits eingesetzt haben, und deshalb ist es so wichtig, das richtige Alter für den Behandlungsbeginn mit diesem Arzneimittel herauszufinden.“</b></p>
<p>Leider werden die Symptome mit der Zeit schlimmer.Als junge Erwachsene bekommen die Patienten Gelenkschmerzen, die zunehmend schlimmer werden. Es kann binnen kurzer Zeit zu lähmenden Rücken- und Gelenkschmerzen kommen, die dazu führen, dass viele Patienten ihre Arbeit aufgeben müssen. Ältere Patienten brauchen unter Umständen Operationen, um ihre gebrochene Gelenke zu ersetzen oder zu festigen. Mit der Zeit werden die Patienten schwer behindert.</p>
<p>Unsere Forschungsteams wissen noch nicht genau, wie sich die Krankheit im Laufe des Lebens eines Patienten verändert. Deshalb müssen wir die Finanzierung für SOFIA, eine neue klinische Studie, sicherstellen. Diese Studie wird Patienten aus einer Auswahl von verschiedenen Altersgruppen miteinander vergleichen und hat das Ziel, die Krankheit besser zu verstehen und das beste Alter für den Therapiebeginn zu ermitteln.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>""Es ist wirklich äußerst wichtig, dass wir herausfinden, in welchem Alter mit Nitisinon begonnen werden soll, damit die Patienten keine dieser beeinträchtigenden Symptome entwickeln.""</b> <i>Ann, AKU Patientin</i></p>
<p>Für unsere SOFIA-Studie werden Patienten aus ganz Europa rekrutiert. Unsere Forscher werden die verschiedenen Gruppen vergleichen, um den tatsächlichen Beginn der Schädigung zu ermitteln. Sie werden dazu verschiedene Hilfsmittel anwenden, wie zum Beispiel eine Beurteilung des Gangbildes, Entnahme von Blut-, Harn- und Ohrknorpelproben.</p>
<p>Diese Arbeit sollte ihnen helfen, zu erkennen, ob bei jungen Patienten eine signifikante Schädigung vorliegt, die nicht sichtbar ist. Das ist sehr wichtig – wenn wir das Arzneimittel früh genug geben, können wir die Patienten möglichweise davor schützen, jemals irgendwelche der schmerzhaften Symptome der AKU zu entwickeln. Durch eine Anwendung im richtigen Alter können wir die Auswirkungen von potenziellen Nebenwirkungen bei heranwachsenden Kindern minimieren.</p>
<p><b>""Wenn wir wüssten, dass er zum richtigen Zeitpunkt ein Arzneimittel bekommen würde, das den Beginn einer solchen schrecklichen Erkrankung verhindern könnte, wäre das sehr erfreulich. Wir wären überglücklich."" </b><i>Jess, Mutter eines AKU-Patienten</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Wir brauchen Ihre Hilfe</b></p>
<p>Alkaptonurie ist sehr selten und wir brauchen Ihre Hilfe, um Patienten aus ganz Europa zusammen zu bringen, damit möglichst viele Daten gesammelt werden können, um das beste Alter für den Beginn einer Behandlung mit Nitisinon zu ermitteln.</p>
<p><b>Hier kommen Sie ins Spiel</b></p>
<p>Für die Finanzierung der medizinischen Arbeit haben wir bereits Geld gesammelt und jetzt geht es um einen Spendenbetrag von 30.000 $ für unsere Arbeit zur Unterstützung der Patienten. Damit werden wir die Studienteilnahme von etwa 15 Patienten voll unterstützen können.</p>
<p>Die ideale Patientenanzahl für diese Studie ist 32. Mit 30.000 $ können wir die Finanzierung und Unterstützung von nahezu der Hälfte der Patienten, die wir für unsere Studie brauchen, übernehmen. Durch Ihre Hilfe können wir Folgendes sicherstellen:</p>
<p>•Abdeckung der Reisekosten von Patienten aus ganz Europa zum Studienzentrum in Liverpool, Großbritannien.</p>
<p>•Abdeckung der Reisekosten für Betreuer(innen) von Patienten, die nicht allein reisen können. Viele Patienten haben Probleme beim Gehen und brauchen die Hilfe eines/einer Betreuer(in).</p>
<p>•Unterstützung unserer Arbeit in der AKU-Gesellschaft. Als Patientengruppe werden wir die Hauptanlaufstelle für die Patienten sein, da wir ihre Arztbesuche vereinbaren und sie nachher betreuen.</p>
<p>•Finanzierung der Kommunikation mit den Patienten, wodurch wir den direkten Kontakt mit jedem Patienten, der an SOFIA teilnehmen kann, herstellen können. Die Patienten teilen uns mit, dass es für sie beruhigend ist, jemanden zu haben, den sie kontaktieren können, um ihre Anliegen zu besprechen und um Rat zu fragen. Dies inkludiert auch die Übersetzungskosten für Patienten, die nicht Englisch sprechen.</p>
<p>•Organisation eines Informationsworkshops. Dieses Patiententreffen wird Patienten, die an SOFIA interessiert sind, Gelegenheit geben, mehr über die Studie zu erfahren und herauszufinden, warum sie wichtig ist.</p>
<p><b>Mit Ihrer Hilfe können wir die Alkaptonurie ein für allemal heilen, bevor es zu spät ist.</b></p>
<p><b>Wie Sie uns sonst helfen können:</b></p>

</div>","Thank you to everyone who has donated to make this campaign such a huge success! We are so excited we have hit our target when we still have a WHOLE WEEK to go! Fantastic work everyone.
But we don't want to give up here. $30,000 secures full funding for 15 patients and their carers. This if half our ideal study number. We know with such a fantastic crowd of supporters, we can raise the funds to support a few more valuable patients...


Each patient costs about $2000 to bring to the center if they require a carer. In just 5 weeks you raised enough money to fully fund 15 patients. This means you funded 3 patients each week! With one week left, we think we should aim to raise the funds for 3 more!
Every patient who takes part in the study is so important to us, and the more patients we can offer to fully fund, the better the experience will be for them. We want to make this research as easy as possible for our patients as they donate their time to help us cure Black Bone Disease.
We are so grateful for what you have done so far. Please help us one more time as we push through our final week, and try to fund a few more crucial patients!

Black Bone Disease is very rare, with fewer than 100 patients in the UK, and just over 1000 diagnosed cases worldwide. We need your help to bring patients from across Europe to gather as much data as we can to find out the best age to start taking Nitisinone.
So, what is Black Bone Disease?

Black Bone Disease is also known as alkaptonuria, or AKU. It is a genetic disease caused by a build-up of acid in the body which attacks bones and other tissue, turning it black and brittle. This causes severe joint damage in patients, and can even result in heart disease.
Black Bone Disease was the first genetic disease to be discovered more than 110 years ago. It still has no approved treatment. We want to change this.
About us
We are the AKU Society; a charity working to support patients with Black Bone Disease. As a patient group we work very closely with and for our patients. Black Bone Disease is very rare, so we work hard to help identify patients and provide them with the information they need about their disease.
Our aim is to improve the level of care and the quality of life for all patients with Black Bone Disease. Driving research is a big part of this patient support. We want to find a treatment that works for patients. Being involved in research and clinical trials ensures they are patient focused, and are always run for the benefit of the patient.
Rosie's story


Rosie is a student in her early twenties. She was diagnosed with Black Bone Disease when she was a baby. Her dad, Ian, is a GP, and Rosie is following in his footsteps by studying medicine at university. Despite his medical background, Ian was very worried when Rosie was first diagnosed at 18 months.
""We were sent into a bit of a spin when we got the diagnosis, because at the time there wasn't any internet, there wasn't the AKU Society and there wasn't any treatment"" Ian, Father of Rosie
He knew without help his daughter would slowly develop joint and spine problems throughout her life, leading to joint replacements and severe disability. More serious problems such as heart disease are also a worry.




Luckily for Rosie, we now have a drug which could prevent her, and others like her, from ever developing any of the debilitating symptoms of Black Bone Disease. It is called nitisinone.
""It would be incredibly important for me to know, and patients like me to know when the best time is to start nitisinone, to prevent us getting the more severe aspects of it, including the arthritis."" Rosie, Young Black Bone Disease Patient

Watch their full story here:

The story so far
We are currently helping to fund a big clinical trial across Europe to test a promising drug for Black Bone Disease. This drug is called nitisinone, and, if it is given at the correct age, it could prevent all of the damage caused by the disease. For patients with Black Bone Disease, this would be life changing.
Our success so far is all thanks to your generosity. In 2013 we launched our first crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo to Cure Black Bone Disease. This campaign was an incredible success, and it is thanks to you we have been able to recruit and support so many patients.
With your help we have been able to pay for patient travel and accommodation, and provide consistent support to patients before, throughout, and after each visit. We have just finished recruitment for our big trial, with over 135 patients taking part. This is a fantastic achievement for such a rare disease!
However, there is still one thing we really need to find out. What is the best age to give this drug? Given too early and the drug could potentially cause side effects harmful to children. Given too late, and the debilitating damage caused by Black Bone Disease will have already set in. This is the next stage of our research.

The next stage
Black Bone Disease affects people throughout their whole lives. From a very early age urine is a dark colour, staining nappies. Children can have dark earwax and dark sweat. Symptoms like this seem harmless at a young age, and children are often perfectly healthy.




Jess is the parent of a little boy with Black Bone Disease. She first noticed something was wrong when she saw dark red staining in her son's urine. Following several visits to the doctors, and some research on the internet, she eventually got her little boy tested for Black Bone Disease. Although he is healthy now, Jess worries about how the disease could impact on his life in the future.



""As a parent its really difficult knowing that our little boy has this disease. He's a very happy and healthy four year old, but invisible damage may have already started, and that's why its so important to find the right age to start taking this drug."" 
Watch their full story here:

Unfortunately, symptoms get more serious with time. Patients start to experience joint pain as young adults, and this gets
progressively worse. They can soon develop crippling back and joint pain,
resulting in many patients having to give up work. Older patients may need
serious operations to replace or fuse their broken joints. Over time, Black Bone Disease leaves patients severely disabled.

Our research teams still don’t know exactly how
the disease changes over a patient’s lifetime. That’s why we need to secure funding for a new clinical study called SOFIA. This study will compare groups of patients from a range of different age groups to better
understand the disease and target the best age to begin treatment.

""It really is crucial that we find out what age to start nitisinone
for patients so they do not develop any of these debilitating symptoms"" Ann, AKU
Patient

Watch Ann's story here:

Our SOFIA study will recruit patients from across Europe. Our researchers will compare these groups to assess when damage really begins. They will do this using a variety of tools, from assessing how patients walk, to taking blood, urine and ear cartilage samples.
This work should help them understand if significant damage is present in young patients in an invisible way. This is very important- if we give the drug early enough, we may be able to prevent patients from ever experiencing any of the painful symptoms of AKU. Given at the correct age, we can minimise the impacts of potential side effects in growing children.

""To know that he was being given a drug at the right time, that
would prevent the onset of such a horrible disease, we would be delighted. We
would be over the moon."" Jess, Parent of AKU patient
We need your help

Black Bone Disease is very rare and we need your help to bring together
patients from across Europe to gather as much data as possible to find out the
best age to start taking Nitisinone.
This is where you come in We have already raised money to pay for the medical work, and now we’re asking for $30,000 for our patient support work. This will allow us to fully support about 15 patients to attend the trial.






Our ideal patient number for this study is 32. With $30,000 we can fully fund and support almost half of the patients we need on our study.Your support will ensure we can:

Cover patient travel from across Europe to the clinical site in Liverpool, UK.
Cover travel for carers of patients who cannot travel alone. Many patients have difficulty walking and must be accompanied by a helper.
Support our work at the AKU Society. As a patient group we will be the main contact for patients, helping to arrange their visits and supporting them afterwards.
Pay for communication with patients, allowing us to be in direct one-on-one contact with EVERY patient who can take part in SOFIA. Patients tell us they find it reassuring to have someone they can contact to discuss their concerns and ask for advice. This also includes the cost of translation for those who speak no English.
Organise an information workshop. This patient meeting will provide those patients interested in SOFIA a chance to find out more about the study and why it is important.
With your help we can cure Black Bone Disease once and for all, before it's too late.

Ayúdanos a curar la alcaptonuria: El tiempo se acaba
La alcaptonuria es una enfermedad muy rara, con poco más de un millar de casos diagnosticados en todo el mundo. Necesitamos tu ayuda para reunir a pacientes de toda Europa y desarrollar un ensayo clínico que nos permita averiguar cuál es la mejor edad para iniciar el tratamiento con Nitisona.
¿En qué consiste la alcaptonuria?
La alcaptonuria es una enfermedad genética que hace que se acumule ácido en el organismo, el cual ataca al esqueleto y a otros tejidos, volviendo los huesos oscuros y frágiles. Esto causa daños severos en las articulaciones de los pacientes y puede incluso producir enfermedades cardiacas.
La alcaptonuria fue la primera enfermedad genética que se descubrió, hace ya más de 110 años. Todavía no tiene un tratamiento aprobado. Queremos cambiar esta situación.
Sobre nosotros
Somos la Asociación de la Alcaptonuria (AKU Society, en inglés), una organización benéfica de ayuda a los pacientes afectados por la alcaptonuria. Como asociación de pacientes, trabajamos muy estrechamente con y para nuestros pacientes. La alcaptonuria es una enfermedad muy rara, así que trabajamos duramente para identificar a los pacientes y proporcionarles la información que necesitan sobre su enfermedad. 
Nuestro objetivo es mejorar el tratamiento y la calidad de vida de todos los pacientes afectados por la alcaptonuria. El impulso a la investigación es una parte my importante de la labor que hacemos por los pacientes. Al implicarnos en la investigación y en los ensayos clínicos, nos aseguramos de que se centren en el paciente y que su objetivo sea siempre el beneficio del paciente.
La historia de Rosie

Rosie es una estudiante de veintipocos años. Fue diagnosticada de alcaptonuria cuando era un bebé. Su padre, Ian, es médico de familia y Rosie quiere seguir sus pasos; está estudiando medicina en la universidad. A pesar de sus conocimientos médicos, Ian se preocupó mucho cuando a Rosie le diagnosticaron la enfermedad con 18 meses.
""Cuando nos dieron el diagnóstico fue terriblemente traumático para nosotros, porque en aquel entonces no existía internet, no existía la Asociación de la Alcaptonuria y no existía ningún tratamiento."" Ian, padre de Rosie.
Ian sabía que, sin ayuda, su hija iría desarrollando paulatinamente problemas en las articulaciones y la columna vertebral durante toda su vida, y acabaría por necesitar prótesis y sufrir de una discapacidad severa. Incluso podría padecer problemas más serios, por ejemplo, del corazón.



Afortunadamente para Rosie, ahora contamos con un fármaco que puede ayudarla, a ella y a otros pacientes como ella, evitando que se produzcan todos los síntomas debilitantes de la alcaptonuria. Se llama Nitisona.
""Sería increíblemente importante para mí, y para otros pacientes como yo, saber cuál es el mejor momento para empezar con la Nitisona, para evitar que desarrollemos los problemas más graves, incluyendo la artritis."" Rosie, paciente de alcaptonuria.
Dónde estamos hoy
En estos momentos, estamos contribuyendo a financiar un gran ensayo clínico a escala europea para probar un fármaco muy prometedor para el tratamiento de la alcaptonuria. Este fármaco se llama Nitisona y, si se empieza a administrar a la edad adecuada, podría prevenir todos los daños causados por la enfermedad. Esto podría transformar las vidas de los pacientes que sufren de alcaptonuria.
Todo lo que hemos conseguido hasta la fecha ha sido gracias a la generosidad de los donantes. En 2013, lanzamos nuestra primera campaña de micromecenazgo (crowdfunding) en la plataforma Indiegogo para curar la alcaptonuria. Esta campaña tuvo un éxito increíble, y gracias a la ayuda recibida hemos logrado reclutar y apoyar a muchos pacientes.
Con la ayuda de los donantes, hemos podido costear los gastos de viaje y alojamiento de los pacientes, y proporcionarles apoyo constante, antes, durante y después de cada visita. Acabamos de terminar de reclutar los pacientes necesarios para un gran ensayo clínico, en el que participarán más de 135 afectados por la alcaptonuria. ¡Un logro fantástico para una enfermedad tan rara!
Sin embargo, aún queda algo muy importante por averiguar. ¿Cuál es la mejor edad para empezar a administrar la Nitisona? Si se empieza demasiado pronto, el fármaco podría tener efectos secundarios dañinos en los niños. Si se empieza demasiado tarde, los daños debilitantes causados por la enfermedad pueden haberse instalado ya. Este es el próximo paso que queremos dar en nuestra investigación.
El próximo paso
La alcaptonuria afecta a los pacientes durante toda su vida. Desde una edad muy temprana, su orina es de color oscuro y mancha los pañales. De niños, puede que tengan cera oscura en los oídos, y que su sudor también sea oscuro. Este tipo de síntomas son aparentemente inofensivos al principio, y los niños afectados pueden parecer perfectamente sanos.

Jess es madre de un pequeño con alcaptonuria. Se dio cuenta por primera vez de algo iba mal cuando vio que la orina de su hijo estaba manchada de rojo oscuro. Después de consultar a varios médicos y buscando información en internet, acabó por conseguir que le hicieran a su pequeño el test de la alcaptonuria. Aunque el niño hoy está sano, Jess está preocupada por el impacto que la enfermedad puede llegar a tener en la vida de su hijo.

""Como madre, es muy duro saber que mi pequeño tiene esta enfermedad. Hoy es un niño feliz y sano, pero puede que el daño haya empezado ya, aunque sea invisible, y por eso es tan importante saber cuál es la edad correcta para empezar a tomar este fármaco.""
Desgraciadamente, los síntomas se agravan con el tiempo. Los pacientes empiezan a experimentar dolores articulares en su juventud y esta situación empeora progresivamente. Pronto pueden desarrollar dolores discapacitantes en la espalda y las articulaciones, lo que obliga a muchos pacientes a dejar de trabajar. Los pacientes mayores pueden necesitar operaciones importantes para reemplazar o fusionar sus articulaciones dañadas. Con el tiempo, la alcaptonuria es causa de discapacidad severa.
Nuestros equipos de investigación todavía no saben exactamente cómo evoluciona la enfermedad a lo largo de la vida del paciente. Por eso necesitamos financiación para un nuevo ensayo clínico llamado SOFIA. Este estudio comparará grupos de pacientes de diferentes edades para entender mejor la enfermedad e identificar la edad idónea para iniciar el tratamiento.
“Es verdaderamente crucial que averigüemos la edad a la que empezar a tratar con Nitisona, para evitar que los pacientes desarrollen esos síntomas debilitantes.” Ann, paciente de alcaptonuria.
El estudio SOFIA reclutará pacientes de toda Europa. Nuestros investigadores compararán los diferentes grupos de edad para valorar cuándo empieza a producirse el daño. Lo harán mediante una serie de herramientas, desde la evaluación de la marcha de los pacientes (cómo caminan), hasta el análisis de muestras de sangre, orina y cartílago auricular.
Este trabajo les ayudará a entender si ya existen daños significativos en pacientes jóvenes, aunque no sean visibles. Es muy importante saberlo, porque si les damos el fármaco lo suficientemente pronto, puede que logremos evitar que los pacientes desarrollen los dolorosos síntomas de la alcaptonuria. Y al administrarlo a la edad correcta, podremos evitar los efectos secundarios que pueden ocurrir en niños que aún están creciendo.
“Si pudiéramos saber que le estamos dando el medicamento en el momento adecuado, si pudiéramos evitar que empezaran los síntomas de esta horrible enfermedad, estaríamos felices. Estaríamos locos de alegría.” Jess, madre de un paciente de alcaptonuria.
Necesitamos tu ayuda
La alcaptonuria es una enfermedad muy rara y necesitamos tu ayuda para reunir a pacientes de toda Europa para recopilar todos los datos que podamos y averiguar cuál es la mejor edad para empezar a tomar Nitisona.
Aquí es donde empieza tu papel
Ya hemos conseguido reunir el dinero necesario para costear la parte médica y ahora necesitamos 30.000 dólares para el apoyo a los pacientes. Esta cantidad nos permitirá dar apoyo completo a unos 15 pacientes para que puedan participar en el ensayo.





Cuesta aproximadamente 2000 $ traer a un paciente europeo a Liverpool para que participe en el ensayo.
Con 30.000 $ podemos cubrir el coste total de 15 pacientes.El número total de pacientes para este ensayo es de 32. Con 30.000 $ podemos financiar y apoyar casi a la mitad de los pacientes que necesitamos. Gracias a tu ayuda, podremos:
•Cubrir los gastos de viaje desde cualquier país europeo al lugar donde se realizará en ensayo clínico en Liverpool, Reino Unido.
•Cubrir los gastos de viaje de los cuidadores de los pacientes que no pueden viajar solos. Muchos pacientes tienen dificultad para caminar y necesitan de un acompañante que les ayude.
•Sufragar el trabajo que hacemos en la Asociación de la Alcaptonuria. Como grupo de apoyo a los pacientes, seremos su principal punto de contacto, les ayudaremos a organizar sus visitas y les daremos apoyo posteriormente.
•Costear la comunicación con los pacientes, posibilitando que mantengamos un contacto individualizado con CADA paciente que participe en el estudio SOFIA. Los pacientes aseguran que para ellos es muy reconfortante contar con alguien con quien consultar sus preocupaciones y a quien pedir consejo. Esto también incluye el coste de la traducción para aquellos que no hablan inglés.
•Organizar un taller informativo. Esta reunión proporciona a los pacientes la oportunidad de informarse sobre el estudio y su importancia.
Gracias a tu ayuda podemos curar la alcaptonuria de una vez por todas, antes de que sea demasiado tarde.

Die sogenannte Black Bone Disease ist mit weniger als 100 Patienten in Großbritannien und knapp 1000 diagnostizierten Fällen weltweit eine sehr seltene Erkrankung.  Wir brauchen Ihre Hilfe, um Patienten aus ganz Europa zusammen zu bringen, damit möglichst viele Daten gesammelt werden können, um das beste Alter für den Beginn einer Behandlung mit Nitisinon zu ermitteln.


Was ist die “Black Bone Disease”?
Die ""Black Bone Disease“ ist auch bekannt als Alkaptonurie oder AKU. Es ist eine genetische Erkrankung, die durch eine Ansammlung von Säuren im Körper verursacht wird, wodurch die Knochen und andere Gewebe angegriffen werden, indem sie schwarz und brüchig werden. Das führt zu schwerwiegenden Gelenkschädigungen und kann sogar eine Herzerkrankung zur Folge haben.
Die Alkaptonurie war die erste genetische Erkrankung, die – vor mehr als 110 Jahren – entdeckt wurde. Für diese Krankheit gibt es bis dato keine zugelassene Behandlung. Wir möchten das ändern.
Über uns
Wir sind die AKU-Gesellschaft, eine wohltätige Vereinigung, die Patienten mit Alkaptonurie unterstützt. Als Patientengruppierung sind wir für unsere Patienten da und arbeiten sehr eng mit ihnen zusammen. Da Alkaptonurie eine sehr seltene Erkrankung ist, arbeiten wir hart daran, bei der Identifizierung der Patienten zu helfen und diese mit den notwendigen Informationen über ihre Krankheit zu versorgen.
Unser Ziel ist es, das Versorgungsniveau und die Lebensqualität aller Patienten mit Alkaptonurie zu verbessern. Die Unterstützung der Patienten besteht zum Großteil darin, die Forschung voranzutreiben. Wir wollen eine Behandlung finden, die für die Patienten funktioniert. Durch unsere Beteiligung an der Forschung und den klinischen Studien wird sichergestellt, dass die Patienten im Fokus stehen und dass die Studien immer zum Nutzen der Patienten durchgeführt werden.

Die Geschichte von Rosie

Rosie ist eine Studentin Anfang zwanzig. Sie wurde mit Alkaptonurie diagnostiziert, als sie ein Baby war. Ihr Vater, Ian, ist Allgemeinmediziner und Rosie tritt in seine Fußstapfen, indem sie Medizin studiert. Trotz seines medizinischen Hintergrundes war Ian sehr beunruhigt, als Rosie erstmalig im Alter von 18 Monaten mit Alkaptonurie diagnostiziert wurde.
“Als wir die Diagnose erhielten, wurden wir mehr oder weniger im Kreis geschickt, da es zu dieser Zeit noch kein Internet, keine AKU-Gesellschaft und keine Behandlung gab“, so Rosies Vater Ian.
Er wusste, dass sich ohne Hilfe bei seiner Tochter im Laufe ihres Lebens langsam Gelenks- und Wirbelsäulenprobleme entwickeln würden, was zu Gelenksoperationen und schwerer Behinderung führen würde. Die noch schlimmere Probleme einer Herzerkrankung stellen eine weitere Befürchtung dar.



Glücklicherweise haben wir jetzt ein Arzneimittel, das verhindern könnte, dass es bei Rosie und anderen Patienten wie sie jemals zu irgendwelchen Behinderungen durch die Alkaptonurie kommen wird. Dieses Arzneimittel heißt Nitisinon.
“Für mich und andere Patienten wie mich wäre es unglaublich wichtig zu wissen, wann der beste Zeitpunkt ist, um mit Nitisinon zu beginnen, damit die schwerwiegendere Erscheinungsbilder der Erkrankung, einschließlich Arthritis, verhindert werden können.“ Rosie, junge Alkaptonurie-Patientin
Die Geschichte bisher 
Derzeit helfen wir bei der Finanzierung einer großen,europaweiten klinischen Studie zur Untersuchung eines viel versprechenden Arzneimittels zur Behandlung der Alkaptonurie. Dieses Arzneimittel heißt Nitisinon und, wenn es im richtigen Alter gegeben wird, könnte es sämtliche Schädigungen, die durch diese Erkrankung verursacht werden, verhindern. Das würde das Leben von Patienten mit Alkaptonurie verändern.
Ihrer Großzügigkeit verdanken wir unseren bisherigen Erfolg. 2013 starteten wir unsere erste sogenannte Crowdfunding-Kampagne, Cure Black Bone Disease, auf Indiegogo. Diese Kampagne war ein unglaublicher Erfolg und wir verdanken es Ihnen, dass wir so viele Patienten rekrutieren und unterstützen konnten. 
Mit Ihrer Hilfe konnten wir die Reise- und Aufenthaltskosten der Patienten abdecken und ihnen vor, während und nach jeder Kontrolle kontinuierlich unterstützen. Gerade haben wir  die Rekrutierung unserer großen Studie, an der mehr als 135 Patienten teilnehmen, abgeschlossen. Bei solch einer seltenen Erkrankung ist das ein großartiges Ereignis!
Es gibt jedoch noch eine Frage, die wir unbedingt lösen müssen. Was ist das beste Alter, um mit diesem Arzneimittel zu beginnen? Wird es zu früh gegeben, könnte es möglicherweise  schädigende Nebenwirkungen bei den Kindern verursachen. Wird es zu spät gegeben, könnte die mit der Alkaptonurie verbundene Schädigung bereits eingesetzt haben. Damit befasst sich die nächste Phase unserer Forschung.
Die nächste Phase
Alkaptonurie beeinträchtigt die Patienten ein Leben lang. Bereits im frühen Alter hinterlässt der dunkel gefärbte Harn Flecken in den Windeln. Die Kinder können auch dunklen Ohrenschmalz und dunklen Schweiß haben. Solche Symptome erscheinen harmlos im jungen Alter und die Kinder sind oft vollkommen gesund.


Jess ist die Mutter eines kleinen Jungen mit Alkaptonurie. Sie merkte erstmals, dass mit ihrem Sohn etwas nicht stimmte, als sie seinen dunkelrot verfärbten Harn sah. Nach mehreren Arztbesuchen und Nachforschungen im Internet ließ sie ihren kleinen Sohn auf Alkaptonurie testen. Obwohl er jetzt gesund ist, macht sich Jess darüber Sorgen, wie die Krankheit in Zukunft sein Leben beeinträchtigen könnte.

""Für mich als Mutter ist es wirklich schwierig, zu wissen, dass unser kleiner Sohn diese Krankheit hat. Er ist ein sehr glückliches und gesundes vierjähriges Kind, aber eine nicht sichtbare Schädigung könnte bei ihm bereits eingesetzt haben, und deshalb ist es so wichtig, das richtige Alter für den Behandlungsbeginn mit diesem Arzneimittel herauszufinden.“
Leider werden die Symptome mit der Zeit schlimmer.Als junge Erwachsene bekommen die Patienten Gelenkschmerzen, die zunehmend schlimmer werden. Es kann binnen kurzer Zeit zu lähmenden Rücken- und Gelenkschmerzen kommen, die dazu führen, dass viele Patienten ihre Arbeit aufgeben müssen. Ältere Patienten brauchen unter Umständen Operationen, um ihre gebrochene Gelenke zu ersetzen oder zu festigen. Mit der Zeit werden die Patienten schwer behindert.
Unsere Forschungsteams wissen noch nicht genau, wie sich die Krankheit im Laufe des Lebens eines Patienten verändert. Deshalb müssen wir die Finanzierung für SOFIA, eine neue klinische Studie, sicherstellen. Diese Studie wird Patienten aus einer Auswahl von verschiedenen Altersgruppen miteinander vergleichen und hat das Ziel, die Krankheit besser zu verstehen und das beste Alter für den Therapiebeginn zu ermitteln.

""Es ist wirklich äußerst wichtig, dass wir herausfinden, in welchem Alter mit Nitisinon begonnen werden soll, damit die Patienten keine dieser beeinträchtigenden Symptome entwickeln."" Ann, AKU Patientin
Für unsere SOFIA-Studie werden Patienten aus ganz Europa rekrutiert. Unsere Forscher werden die verschiedenen Gruppen vergleichen, um den tatsächlichen Beginn der Schädigung zu ermitteln. Sie werden dazu verschiedene Hilfsmittel anwenden, wie zum Beispiel eine Beurteilung des Gangbildes, Entnahme von Blut-, Harn- und Ohrknorpelproben.
Diese Arbeit sollte ihnen helfen, zu erkennen, ob bei jungen Patienten eine signifikante Schädigung vorliegt, die nicht sichtbar ist. Das ist sehr wichtig – wenn wir das Arzneimittel früh genug geben, können wir die Patienten möglichweise davor schützen, jemals irgendwelche der schmerzhaften Symptome der AKU zu entwickeln. Durch eine Anwendung im richtigen Alter können wir die Auswirkungen von potenziellen Nebenwirkungen bei heranwachsenden Kindern minimieren.
""Wenn wir wüssten, dass er zum richtigen Zeitpunkt ein Arzneimittel bekommen würde, das den Beginn einer solchen schrecklichen Erkrankung verhindern könnte, wäre das sehr erfreulich. Wir wären überglücklich."" Jess, Mutter eines AKU-Patienten

Wir brauchen Ihre Hilfe
Alkaptonurie ist sehr selten und wir brauchen Ihre Hilfe, um Patienten aus ganz Europa zusammen zu bringen, damit möglichst viele Daten gesammelt werden können, um das beste Alter für den Beginn einer Behandlung mit Nitisinon zu ermitteln.
Hier kommen Sie ins Spiel
Für die Finanzierung der medizinischen Arbeit haben wir bereits Geld gesammelt und jetzt geht es um einen Spendenbetrag von 30.000 $ für unsere Arbeit zur Unterstützung der Patienten. Damit werden wir die Studienteilnahme von etwa 15 Patienten voll unterstützen können.
Die ideale Patientenanzahl für diese Studie ist 32. Mit 30.000 $ können wir die Finanzierung und Unterstützung von nahezu der Hälfte der Patienten, die wir für unsere Studie brauchen, übernehmen. Durch Ihre Hilfe können wir Folgendes sicherstellen:
•Abdeckung der Reisekosten von Patienten aus ganz Europa zum Studienzentrum in Liverpool, Großbritannien.
•Abdeckung der Reisekosten für Betreuer(innen) von Patienten, die nicht allein reisen können. Viele Patienten haben Probleme beim Gehen und brauchen die Hilfe eines/einer Betreuer(in).
•Unterstützung unserer Arbeit in der AKU-Gesellschaft. Als Patientengruppe werden wir die Hauptanlaufstelle für die Patienten sein, da wir ihre Arztbesuche vereinbaren und sie nachher betreuen.
•Finanzierung der Kommunikation mit den Patienten, wodurch wir den direkten Kontakt mit jedem Patienten, der an SOFIA teilnehmen kann, herstellen können. Die Patienten teilen uns mit, dass es für sie beruhigend ist, jemanden zu haben, den sie kontaktieren können, um ihre Anliegen zu besprechen und um Rat zu fragen. Dies inkludiert auch die Übersetzungskosten für Patienten, die nicht Englisch sprechen.
•Organisation eines Informationsworkshops. Dieses Patiententreffen wird Patienten, die an SOFIA interessiert sind, Gelegenheit geben, mehr über die Studie zu erfahren und herauszufinden, warum sie wichtig ist.
Mit Ihrer Hilfe können wir die Alkaptonurie ein für allemal heilen, bevor es zu spät ist.

<h1><b>Què és #joventutmodel?</b></h1>
<p>Actualment, més de 500 nens i joves jugadors es formen cada any a

base dels Minnesota Timberwolves i número 5 del draft de l’NBA l’any 2009; com
Rudy Fernández (Portland Trail Blazers 2008-2011 i campió de l’Eurolliga 2015),

Club Joventut Badalona
Founded in 1930, Club Joventut Badalona is one of
the most prestigious basketball teams in Europe and in the FIBA basketball.
Europe’s champion and champion of the Spanish National League (ACB) in several occasions,
beyond its titles, the “Penya”, name which the club is known by the basketball
family, it’s also recognized as one of the main contributors forming young
players around the world.  
What is #joventutmodel?
Currently more than 500 kids and young people
are formed every year in the basketball school and in the club’s youth categories.
All of them aspire to become basketball stars, such as Ricky Rubio, current PG
of the Minnesota Timberwolves and drafted 5 in 2009; Rudy Fernández (Portland
Trailblazers 2008-2011 and 2015 Euroleague champion) or Raúl López (Utah Jazz,
2003-2005). But above all, they learn the sports values through the educational
and formative labor that the Joventut model represents from its foundation 85 years
ago. 

What are you contributing to?
“We believe in Basketball, we save
#joventutmodel” is a campaign aimed at getting the necessary funds to maintain
this club’s model and its human and social formative labor, and avoid its
disappearance. All the supports received from those who believe in basketball
as the Club Joventut Badalona does will be used to complete the club’s budget dedicated to form young players,
diminished in the last few years due to an unfavorable economic context.  

If you believe in the essence of this sport. If
you want to contribute saving the Joventut model. Donate, click one of the options at the right column and join us at

In Honduras alone, there are more than 50,000 people who suffer from cataract blindness. For almost all of these patients, vision can be fully restored with minimal resources and a 20-minute surgery. For 20 years, ECHO Foundation (Eradicating Cataracts Honduras Outreach) has supported Honduran ophthalmology with a three-fold mission: support sustainable practices that increase surgical volumes, contribute to educational and infrastructure improvements, and help grow the ophthalmology sector in Honduras.</p>

For the past 10 years, Hospital Fraternidad has performed hundreds of cataract surgeries per year, but has yet to break 1,000. Similarly sized facilities in the developed world routinely perform several thousand surgeries per year. Along the way, we have learned that a major obstacle to increasing the number of sight-saving surgeries at Hospital Fraternidad is outdated, broken, or missing equipment.</p>

The new set will consist of brand-new high quality surgical instruments, and will be tailored to meet the preferences of Drs. Pacheco and Ramirez. Happy surgeons using brand-new instruments tailored to their surgical preferences increases quality of care and the number of surgeries that can be performed. As part of this campaign, we will also help Hospital Fraternidad purchase enough supplies to exceed 1,000 cataract surgeries for 2015.</p>

</div></div>","About Us
Cataracts are the leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide. In Honduras alone, there are more than 50,000 people who suffer from cataract blindness. For almost all of these patients, vision can be fully restored with minimal resources and a 20-minute surgery. For 20 years, ECHO Foundation (Eradicating Cataracts Honduras Outreach) has supported Honduran ophthalmology with a three-fold mission: support sustainable practices that increase surgical volumes, contribute to educational and infrastructure improvements, and help grow the ophthalmology sector in Honduras.

 Before and After Cataract Surgery.
In 2013, ECHO Foundation began a partnership with the San Pedro Sula Lions Eye Hospital Fraternidad to increase the number of cataract surgeries performed at their facility as part of ECHO’s Unidos Visión Sustainability Initiative. For the past 10 years, Hospital Fraternidad has performed hundreds of cataract surgeries per year, but has yet to break 1,000. Similarly sized facilities in the developed world routinely perform several thousand surgeries per year. Along the way, we have learned that a major obstacle to increasing the number of sight-saving surgeries at Hospital Fraternidad is outdated, broken, or missing equipment.
To overcome this problem and increase the number of cataract surgeries in Honduras, we have launched a three-year fundraising campaign to bring modern equipment to this non-profit eye hospital. Over a three year period, we will launch twelve fundraising campaigns (this is campaign #2), each focused on a vital piece of equipment. With this new equipment, we expect to increase surgical volumes to 1,500 per year!


What We Need & What You Get
The second step of this three-year program to increase surgical volumes is to add a new set of cataract surgery instruments at Hospital Fraternidad, as well as enough surgical supplies to perform over 1,000 surgeries in 2015.
The current surgical instruments have been in use for quite a while, and don't include all of the instruments that can make a surgeon's job easier. The new set will consist of brand-new high quality surgical instruments, and will be tailored to meet the preferences of Drs. Pacheco and Ramirez. Happy surgeons using brand-new instruments tailored to their surgical preferences increases quality of care and the number of surgeries that can be performed. As part of this campaign, we will also help Hospital Fraternidad purchase enough supplies to exceed 1,000 cataract surgeries for 2015.
With the successful close of each quarterly campaign, we work with our partners in the US and Honduras to purchase, ship, and install the new equipment. The new operating microscopes purchased following campaign #1 are already in use at Hospital Fraternidad! Finally, we also collaborate to ensure that there are adequate resources to maintain the equipment that is being placed in the hospital.

Perks
For the many of you out there thinking about it:
$25 – Thumbs up! Receive a personalized thank you post card.
$100 – Join the wall of fame! Your name will be displayed on a special wall in the hospital with other supporters (plus the above).
$250 – Wear your support! You will receive one of the 25 limited edition t-shirts designed especially for this project (plus all of the above).
$1000 – Join the club! Become a member of the select group who have supported ECHO at the Buena Vista level ($1,000 and above). You will be publicly recognized on ECHO’s website and receive a commemorative plaque thanking you for your support (plus all of the above).
$5000 – See the impact first hand in Honduras! You will receive an invitation to join one of the quarterly surgical brigades that ECHO runs and see first-hand the great work that local and volunteer doctors can do with the right equipment (plus all of the perks above).


The Wall of Fame
The Impact
Reaching 1,500 cataract surgeries per year is a realistic goal for Hospital Fraternidad with modern equipment because of the following reasons:
1.  There is a clear demand for these surgeries.
2.  ECHO and the San Pedro Sula Lions are organizations with a long-term commitment to addressing cataract blindness in Honduras.
3.  There is a growing team of committed doctors, technicians, nurses and administrators (both in the US and Honduras) working to eradicate cataract blindness.
These factors have produced a growth in the number of surgeries performed at Hospital Fraternidad from 453 in 2012 to over 800 in 2014. However, the hospital’s main bottleneck relates to the antiquated equipment that its medical staff must rely on or the missing equipment they lack.
ECHO Foundation has a 20 year track record as a protagonist for Honduran ophthalmology. The San Pedro Sula Lions have been working on issues related to Honduran ophthalmology for more than 20 years. There is every reason to expect that the hospital will one day perform 2,500 cataract surgeries per year.

Risks & Challenges
Ordinarily, it would be difficult to quantify the impacts placing surgical equipment at a facility in a developing country has on surgical volumes and facility sustainability. This is why we will be working with the San Pedro Sula Lions to closely monitor our surgical impacts, as well as the impact of our expansion program on the hospital’s financial status. 
Keeping functional equipment working and in good condition has historically been difficult at facilities in developing countries. Some of the revenues from increased surgical volumes are being set aside in a maintenance reserve to be used when needed to ensure that the equipment will remain in top working condition.
This campaign is just the second step in turning the Lion’s Hospital into a modern facility that can effectively eliminate cataract blindness in Honduras. Building upon existing in-country resources and working with an established local network will maximize the effect of each capital equipment impact. Even with limited resources, the Lions Hospital has performed hundreds of surgeries per year in the past. Your support in this campaign will allow us to grow the hospital to full operating capacity and positively impact the more than 50,000 poor cataract blind people in Honduras.

<h3>THE CAUSE</h3>
<p>My name is Carleigh Kaiser and I live in Northern Virginia. I'm 23 and excited about life! Some of my specific loves are travel &amp; diversity, painting, songwriting and playing ultimate frisbee.</p>
<p>I've started this campaign because, for the past 4 years, I have struggled with chronic health issues and now things have come to a head. We have finally found a doctor who's gotten to the root cause of all my problems. For about 3 months I've been working through an integrative health plan, but my results are not forth coming. The reason?</p>
<p>MERCURY.</p>
<p>I have an extremely high level of mercury in my system (most of it probably due to my childhood immunizations &amp; severe love of tuna) and it has drastically lowered my immunity. This is bad news because my body is trying to fight off fibromyalgia, Lyme disease that I contracted as a child, plus a candida yeast overgrowth and a few other potential bad guys in my gut &amp; it's just too overwhelmed.<br/><br/>The solution?  Intravenous treatements of glutathione- as often as every day! Mercury is very hard to get rid of, but glutathione (which is a naturally occuring peptide in the body) binds to the toxic mercury and then removes it from the body. This process is called chelation therapy. It is an essential detoxer and relieves my cells of thier oxidative stress, allowing them to pick up their feet and get things done!</p>
<p>After my first treatment of glutathione, I was about to dance in the streets! It was a night and day difference for me. If this campaign pulls through, I will be able to use glutathione to rid my body of this toxic oppressor and my body will be able to start healing itself more effectively. After 4 long years, I couldn't thank you enough.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>THE COST</h3>
<p>To get this glutathione intravenously, I could need up to $165 a session. If I do this every day for 3 months, the cost comes to $14,850.</p>
<p>Since this therapy is used by more integrative health practitioners, insurance is often not accepted. And even when it is, claims are often rejected.<br/>My father has been diligenty working for almost a year now at his job, but so much of our money is already going towards vitmans, doctors visits and organic eating. We are in a hard place financially, and so I am turning to you to come and fight this battle alongside us.</p>
<p>I am not the only one in my family fighting a hard health battle either. Any extra money I might raise will go directly towards the health of my precious family.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>THE CHANGE</h3>
<p>I am at a point in my life where I am working towards deciding on a direction for my future. The brain fog, fatigue, pain, and depression that have resulted from this toxicity have started to drain me of my drive and hope...but not completely!</p>
<p><br/>A change in my health like the change glutathione will afford is going to set me on a course to ride out my destiny. I want to impact this world! I want to help the helpless and give hope to the hopeless. I want to share music, art, dance, love and joy. I want diversity and I want unity together.</p>
<p>So let's make it happen. Let's tame the toxic takeover!</p>

<p>I’m writing this letter with hopes that friends could possibly help my father. My father, Jay Merrill, was diagnosed with Myleodysplastic Syndrome about 8 months ago. I recently saw a documentary about Dr. Burzynski and his struggles to gain approval for  Antineoplaston cancer treatment, and was impressed at the overwhelming show of praise the families of loved ones saved by his clinic. My father is a great man, a hard worker, a father of five and a grandfather to thirteen. He is also a very stubborn man, who has told me he simply refuses to undergo traditional chemotherapy treatments when his disease inevitably turns into Leukemia. He believes that the chemicals used in today’s medicine are far more damaging than dying slowly from the disease they were designed to fight, and after watching a close friend of mine’s mother die in suffering from the chemo therapy she was given to fight her melanoma this past year, I can’t say I blame him. Although it hasn’t turned to full Leukemia just yet, the doctors have told us he has RAEB-II, and that the prognosis for his MDS turning into Leukemia are much higher. To me, if there is any hope to be had, it will be due to taking action sooner than later. This is why I am contacting you…I was hoping friends could possibly help my family raise money for this alternative treatment, and at least give us some hope for his survival. I’m just not ready to let him go without somewhat of a fight.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> My father Jay Merrill lives in Missouri and I live in Las Vegas. My parents do not have a lot of money,  I was hoping if enough people got together could help raise enough money to start these treatments.  He is in the high-risk category, and I’m afraid traditional medicine would be futile. Dr. Burzynski doesnt except insurance because its a non traditional treatment and unfortunately his treatments are expensive. im hoping to raise at least 25,000 in hopes it covers most of the medical bills. We really don’t want to see him go before his time, and my gut and all my research on alternative treatments tells me Dr. Burzynski offers him the best shot at a fighting chance. To me 67 is still too young to say goodbye. Please hear-out a family who desperately needs hope in their lives. I hope and pray i can raise enough money to send him to the Burzynski clinic in Houston Texas. He needs to start treatments in the end of february beginning of march. Thanks to anyone and everyone who takes the time to read my letter for hope... If everyone who reads this could pass on the message it would help get the word out.</p>

<p>We've probably all heard the stale joke about building the plane out of the same material they make the black box from. But if an airplane has a black box, why shouldn't we have one? We need a means of gaining an added measure of security during crises.</p>
<h2><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Proof of Loss Required for Payment</span></h2>
<p>The invention of insurance was about as close as we've gotten to black box protection. But it isn't fail safe.  We all say we're <em>insuring</em> our car, house, boat, or what have you. But in reality there aren't guys flying around in tights with an ""S"" on their chest who jump in and save our stuff right before catastrophe strikes! That would be a perfect insurance solution that would eliminate the need for insurance claims in the first place!</p>
<p>You must <strong>HELP YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY HELP YOU!  </strong>Do you know what your duties are toward your insurer when you send in a damage claim? Well, it's <strong>YOUR</strong> <strong>DUTY</strong> to give them tangible evidence of your claim by establishing a genuine, bona fide <strong>PROOF OF LOSS! </strong>So the minute you have a loss, you already owe your insurance company something, before they can even consider making a payout to you.</p>
<p>Even if you can give them evidence of loss of your important memories, the most your insurer will likely be able to do is to pay your claim, but nothing more. Even though, you've been payed, your stuff will still be gone, likely without the ability to reproduce it. Unless you Blackboxitup beforehand.</p>
<h2><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Blackboxitup.com-Personalized Black Box Protection</span></h2>
<p>Our service is being designed to help you survive an unfortunate event.  It's <strong><em>social networking with a purpose</em></strong>. One that supersedes just posting pictures of yourself in a silly hat (which you can also do, if you'd like to).  We’re designing and engineering a safe, secure place to discreetly deposit your most valuable photos, recipes, art and music projects, receipts, financial, medical records and other important documentation.</p>
<p>But it's not just for data storage.  You're encouraged to photograph or scan your valuable property for deposit into your personal black box.  You'll be prompted to identify and value each  item so that it can be added to your personal property inventory. You can also associate it with a receipt.  This can be completed in a day or gradually, over time.</p>
<p>After you've deposited your items, you can retrieve and reproduce hard copy images, reports and claims, at will, as the need arises. Your information will be availble to you on multiple computers, smart phones and other devices across multiple platforms. Our entire raison d'etre is survival, protection, and helping you, help your insurance company by establishing the essential elements of a sound proof of loss after a catastrophic event.</p>
<h3>If you do suffer a loss Blackboxitup.com will come to your aid with a couple of simple steps:</h3>
<p><strong>A.)</strong> Simply pull up your electronic claim form and it'll prompt you through a checklist allowing you to choose items from your inventory.  Your information will be automatically formatted into a neatly summarized claim form, accompanied by photos, and receipts. </p>
<p><strong>B.)</strong> Next, just print your completed claim and email, fax, snail mail or hand deliver it to your Adjuster and they'll have the documentary evidence necessary to establish your proof of loss, which will help them adjust and pay your claim.</p>
<p>Depending on your insurance coverage, you can recover the reproduction costs of your documents and photos.  There's enough to worry about after a catastrophe, already. Let alone worrying about your stuff! If you don't Blackboxitup, you'll never be able to accomplish the extensive level of reproduction that will be needed, if all is lost.</p>
<p>This procedure can be used for other purposes, too, such as producing well supported banking, business and financial statements, creating your will, etc. There are countless possibilities and scenarios.  We're certain you'll think of more uses for these important tools as time goes on.  Blackboxitup.com will also help you stay in touch with your network and the community at large, across multiple platforms and integrated services as a central meeting location.  This would be beneficial for a planning a party, and crucial during a crisis. </p>
<p>A mall area will be establish, too, where we'll feature all of the goods, gear &amp; gadgetry.  This will include items like smart phones and accessories, scanniers, and computers.  Also, disaster supplies will be featured for your planning needs, along with weather and catastrophe specific updates at a glance.</p>

<h3>Lemony Snickets - I've Personally Experienced A Series of Unfortunate, Catastrophic, Life-Altering Events!</h3>
<p>I mentioned in the video describing this project that <strong>you</strong> may have a catastrophic event. Well, we never really seem to expect it to happen to us, I know first hand, because I didn't expect it either. But, I've had a number of experiences in life that I can only say, modified my existence on this planet. Here are a just a few: My vehicle was robbed, with 2 computers stolen alon with my family's passports, various, other important documents and thousands of irreplaceable photos &amp; docs. on my hard drives.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago after a routine physical I was diagnosed with the 'Big C'. Fortunately for me I'm now a cancer SURVIVOR! Last year we experienced significant tornado and lightning damage and worst of all, this spring, my home was burglarized. Along with computers, the burglars stole my entire home study including every single personal photo, negative, video tape &amp; DVD I owned. I now have no photos of my youth, wedding or my family remaining except those that were digitized and saved elsewhere!</p>
<p>What I miss most of all is seeing photos of my wife and I together when we were younger, as well as our children's baby pictures &amp; loved ones who've since passed away. It hurts deeply to even mention these details. But, I now know resoundingly, that this could happen to anyone! After all, the disasters that we hear about in the media are happening to someone. At some point in the future that <em>someone</em> may well be you or me! Most of the people who experience disasters probably thought: 'it'll never happen to me', right before it actually did happen to them.</p>
<h3><strong>What was the Genesis of Blackboxitup.com?</strong></h3>
<p><strong></strong>As you might imagine, when I received a cancer diagnosis and chemotherapy beckoning me in my future, it also armed me with a bucket list. So, before I started chemo, I decided to leave the north country with my son and head back out to Moshav Beit Zayit by the Jerusalem Forest, where I spent time as a youth, because I wasn't sure if I could ever return there again and I wanted to go back at least one more time.</p>
<p>My son and I took fabulous photos there. So I started thinking to myself: 'I know, material things aren't the most important in the world, especially now...But if I had to chose some, which of them would be the most important to me?' Of course most things are replaceable, but important video memories and original documents often can't be reproduced. So I realizing that we're all in the same boat, I concluded that everyone needs black box protection. This was the seed of the idea. In the Hebrew language Genesis is Bereshit or looseley, ""in the beginning"", thus, in this way <strong>Blackboxitup.com </strong>was born.</p>
<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Critical Conditions Hard To Deal With Worldwide</span></h3>
<p>You can call it <strong>'Global Warming'</strong>, <strong>'2012',</strong> <strong>'The End of the World',</strong> <strong>'The Last Days of the System of Things', </strong>or like Michael Jackson said ""blame it on the boogie!""

<p>Plus, these things have been happening with seemingly greater frequency and intensity and in one place after the other, as if with birthing pains.

<h3>Why is funding needed?</h3>
<p>We need about $30,000.00 to complete our initial phase, substantially more will be needed to complete the next phases of our project. This is an active work in progress with a real budget and an active schedule.

Having overcome cancer, I'm a real SURVIVOR, our team will get this project launched come heck or high water, quite possibly, literally speaking!</p>
<p>Our project addresses a critical need and we really want this to be a community effort from design to launch and beyond! We hope that by working together, we'll help the site become an integral part of our respective survival preparedness planning. Whereas there are destructive elements in this world that threaten our personal peace and security. So we welcome your support!</p>
<h3>Engineering &amp; Design Phases:</h3>
<p>1.) The website and subject of this project is the <strong>Phase I.  </strong>We'll finalize, beta test and launch the fully operational website. Although, the basic framework has already been engineered, we can't convey any more vehemently that we're giving all supporters an opportunity to vocalize the features that you'd like to see incorporated into your personal black box. We'd like to include features that you'd enjoy most, so please share them with us while we're still in the first phase. Please use this opportunity to <strong>HAVE YOUR VOICE HEARD </strong>because we'll listen attentively to you!</p>
<p>2.) In <strong>Phase II</strong>, we're developing a full complement of smartphone applications. It's features will make it easy for you to take a photo, identify and assign a value or receipt to an item for your inventory list and deposit it into your personal black box.</p>
<p>3.) <strong>Phase III</strong>, may be the most exciting of all! In this phase we'll finalize the engineering of a physical personal black box which will be offered first to current members of Blackboxitup.com at the time of its release. It'll have some amazing features, which we look forward to sharing with you in the future!</p>
<p>Once Phase One has been accomplished, we'll keep you posted on the development of subsequent phases and again, incorporate your voice in future developments. We're very curious to hear what features you'd like to have in a physical black box of your very own!</p>
<p>We also welcome your personal support and request that you, please, share details with your friends, family and associates about our exciting projects on <strong>Facebook</strong>, <strong>Google, Twitter, Linkedin</strong>, etc.</p>
<p>Despite all of the challenges we all face, we're living an exciting time period for technological development! This is proven by the aforementioned sites who are doing a fabulous job in their respective niches! It's also time for Blackboxitup.com to take its place in our lives and help us through trying times. What an honor and privilege it would be to be mentioned in the same breath as the preceding operations at some time in the future.</p>
<p>As you lend your support to our project, we trust that you'll never, ever forget that you were right here with us at the beginning of it all. Furthermore, neither will we! Right now, time is of the essence in getting this project off the ground and <strong>WE THANK YOU, IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR TIME, CONSIDERATION AND SUPPORT!</strong></p>

We've probably all heard the stale joke about building the plane out of the same material they make the black box from. But if an airplane has a black box, why shouldn't we have one? We need a means of gaining an added measure of security during crises.
Proof of Loss Required for Payment
The invention of insurance was about as close as we've gotten to black box protection. But it isn't fail safe.  We all say we're insuring our car, house, boat, or what have you. But in reality there aren't guys flying around in tights with an ""S"" on their chest who jump in and save our stuff right before catastrophe strikes! That would be a perfect insurance solution that would eliminate the need for insurance claims in the first place!
You must HELP YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY HELP YOU!  Do you know what your duties are toward your insurer when you send in a damage claim? Well, it's YOUR DUTY to give them tangible evidence of your claim by establishing a genuine, bona fide PROOF OF LOSS! So the minute you have a loss, you already owe your insurance company something, before they can even consider making a payout to you.
Even if you can give them evidence of loss of your important memories, the most your insurer will likely be able to do is to pay your claim, but nothing more. Even though, you've been payed, your stuff will still be gone, likely without the ability to reproduce it. Unless you Blackboxitup beforehand.
Blackboxitup.com-Personalized Black Box Protection
Our service is being designed to help you survive an unfortunate event.  It's social networking with a purpose. One that supersedes just posting pictures of yourself in a silly hat (which you can also do, if you'd like to).  We’re designing and engineering a safe, secure place to discreetly deposit your most valuable photos, recipes, art and music projects, receipts, financial, medical records and other important documentation.
But it's not just for data storage.  You're encouraged to photograph or scan your valuable property for deposit into your personal black box.  You'll be prompted to identify and value each  item so that it can be added to your personal property inventory. You can also associate it with a receipt.  This can be completed in a day or gradually, over time.
After you've deposited your items, you can retrieve and reproduce hard copy images, reports and claims, at will, as the need arises. Your information will be availble to you on multiple computers, smart phones and other devices across multiple platforms. Our entire raison d'etre is survival, protection, and helping you, help your insurance company by establishing the essential elements of a sound proof of loss after a catastrophic event.
If you do suffer a loss Blackboxitup.com will come to your aid with a couple of simple steps:
A.) Simply pull up your electronic claim form and it'll prompt you through a checklist allowing you to choose items from your inventory.  Your information will be automatically formatted into a neatly summarized claim form, accompanied by photos, and receipts. 
B.) Next, just print your completed claim and email, fax, snail mail or hand deliver it to your Adjuster and they'll have the documentary evidence necessary to establish your proof of loss, which will help them adjust and pay your claim.
Depending on your insurance coverage, you can recover the reproduction costs of your documents and photos.  There's enough to worry about after a catastrophe, already. Let alone worrying about your stuff! If you don't Blackboxitup, you'll never be able to accomplish the extensive level of reproduction that will be needed, if all is lost.
This procedure can be used for other purposes, too, such as producing well supported banking, business and financial statements, creating your will, etc. There are countless possibilities and scenarios.  We're certain you'll think of more uses for these important tools as time goes on.  Blackboxitup.com will also help you stay in touch with your network and the community at large, across multiple platforms and integrated services as a central meeting location.  This would be beneficial for a planning a party, and crucial during a crisis. 
A mall area will be establish, too, where we'll feature all of the goods, gear & gadgetry.  This will include items like smart phones and accessories, scanniers, and computers.  Also, disaster supplies will be featured for your planning needs, along with weather and catastrophe specific updates at a glance.

Lemony Snickets - I've Personally Experienced A Series of Unfortunate, Catastrophic, Life-Altering Events!
I mentioned in the video describing this project that you may have a catastrophic event. Well, we never really seem to expect it to happen to us, I know first hand, because I didn't expect it either. But, I've had a number of experiences in life that I can only say, modified my existence on this planet. Here are a just a few: My vehicle was robbed, with 2 computers stolen alon with my family's passports, various, other important documents and thousands of irreplaceable photos & docs. on my hard drives.
A couple of years ago after a routine physical I was diagnosed with the 'Big C'. Fortunately for me I'm now a cancer SURVIVOR! Last year we experienced significant tornado and lightning damage and worst of all, this spring, my home was burglarized. Along with computers, the burglars stole my entire home study including every single personal photo, negative, video tape & DVD I owned. I now have no photos of my youth, wedding or my family remaining except those that were digitized and saved elsewhere!
What I miss most of all is seeing photos of my wife and I together when we were younger, as well as our children's baby pictures & loved ones who've since passed away. It hurts deeply to even mention these details. But, I now know resoundingly, that this could happen to anyone! After all, the disasters that we hear about in the media are happening to someone. At some point in the future that someone may well be you or me! Most of the people who experience disasters probably thought: 'it'll never happen to me', right before it actually did happen to them.
What was the Genesis of Blackboxitup.com?
As you might imagine, when I received a cancer diagnosis and chemotherapy beckoning me in my future, it also armed me with a bucket list. So, before I started chemo, I decided to leave the north country with my son and head back out to Moshav Beit Zayit by the Jerusalem Forest, where I spent time as a youth, because I wasn't sure if I could ever return there again and I wanted to go back at least one more time.
My son and I took fabulous photos there. So I started thinking to myself: 'I know, material things aren't the most important in the world, especially now...But if I had to chose some, which of them would be the most important to me?' Of course most things are replaceable, but important video memories and original documents often can't be reproduced. So I realizing that we're all in the same boat, I concluded that everyone needs black box protection. This was the seed of the idea. In the Hebrew language Genesis is Bereshit or looseley, ""in the beginning"", thus, in this way Blackboxitup.com was born.
Critical Conditions Hard To Deal With Worldwide
You can call it 'Global Warming', '2012', 'The End of the World', 'The Last Days of the System of Things', or like Michael Jackson said ""blame it on the boogie!"" But SOMETHING WEIRD IS GOING ON IN THE ENVIRONMENT NO MATTER HOW YOU SLICE IT!!! Whatever the reasons, our home, the earth, is experiencing an increasingly dramatic, catastrophic turn of events that are totally beyond our ability to control.
Plus, these things have been happening with seemingly greater frequency and intensity and in one place after the other, as if with birthing pains. Whether great earthquakes, epoch fires, large scale floods, super tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons, cyclones, tsunamis, sink holes, and the list goes on!

<p>My name is Toni Causey and my Mom's name is Debbie Cox. She was diagnosed with Inflammatory Breast Cancer in February 2012. Inflammatory Breast Cancer is a very rare and aggressive form of Breast Cancer, only 1 to 5 percent of women in the United States are diagnosed with this form of cancer. Within one week of finding the lump it had grown into an 8 inch tumor. She has gone through 4 months of chemotherapy. She was supposed to have another 6 to 9 weeks of chemo to go, but she is doing badly with it, so they are stretching it out. Her red blood cell count, as well as her white blood count has dropped so low that she has already had to have a blood infusion. She was prescribed a walker with a seat and also a shower chair because she was too weak to walk or even take a shower without the shower chair.  After the chemo, she will have a mastectomy to remove the tumor. Following this surgery she will have radiation for an unknown period of time, followed by reconstructive surgery.</p>
<p>She has already encountered thousands of dollars in medical bills since February and there will be many more to come. This is going to be a very long process, and she needs any help she can get. All donations no matter the amount are greatly appreciated. They will all go towards medical bills. </p>

<p>UWE'S WORDS</p>
<p>Its a little hard but not<br/>	entirely.   I had to go through some bumps in the road.  Like not <br/>	liking the way I look, thinking that no one would want to be my<br/>	friend or not getting a boyfriend.  I was focused on myself feeling<br/>	bad for me when there are other people who have it worse than me.  I<br/>	was in a bulling situation and I would feel sorry for myself.  My<br/>	family and I kept going to church every Sunday and Wednesday but<br/>	sometime I wouldn't pay attention, because I thought I didn't have<br/>	to be there.  But as I got older my life was getting harder so I was<br/>	listening to what my pastor was preaching in church.   He was talking<br/>	about you are not alone, as long as we have the glory of God. I used<br/>	to think that I didn't have anybody to talk to but I started <br/>	reading the Bible and joining the clubs at church.  I was not being<br/>	the quiet one.  It is a little easier but I have to still deal with<br/>	people staring at me. <br/></p>
<p>I am glad I choose to listen to my pastor and read my bible.                                                It changed me a lot and made me realize that I not the only person in the world going through things in my life.  I was lucky to have a chance to learn Gods word,<br/>	because some people do not have that chance.  With all those years of<br/>	learning Gods word and going to church It made me more open to try<br/>	new things.   Last year I went to a church called Cross Timber that is<br/>	where I got saved at.  I was eleven at the time and that following<br/>	Sunday I was baptized.   It changed my life.   I don't know how to<br/>	explain it but it just made me feel better about who I am. <br/></p>
<p>So let me tell you about the body that I live in. My skin makes my life physically hard<br/>	because I cant move certain parts of my body due to my shin is so<br/>	tight. My skin is stopping me from following my dreams to be a<br/>	professional dancer.  A dancer has to move a lot so my skin keeps me<br/>	from moving around.  My hand cant stretch out all the way which makes<br/>	it hard to do flips.  I cant move my arm certain ways either because<br/>	under my arm pit the skin is very tight and cracks and bleeds.  When I<br/>	see myself in the mirror it makes me cry because I don't look like<br/>	everybody else.  People judge me before they get to know me.  I<br/>	have other dreams like getting treatments to help me, I want to get<br/>	married one day and have children like everyone else.  I have dreams<br/>	like you have dreams. <br/></p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Elma Flores, my mom is Hilda Rodriguez she was born on September 16, 1953 born and raised in Monterrey, Mexico grew up with four brothers and three sisters, she was the youngest among the sisters. She was the first in her family to go to College and get a career as a lawyer, though at that time it was considered of it being a male profession, she still conquered it. She wedded my father at 31 and had me at 32. When I was 4 my dad was offered a visa to come to the beautiful states. At 42 she had my sister Emily Flores who is now a senior and top 10% of her class, also an honor student all 4 years. My mom has been diagnosed with Cholesterol, and Diabetes before but she has controlled and overcame that. Now she has been diagnosed with a rare type of breast cancer and will be needing surgery and radiology.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>We need your Support</h3>
<p>Our mom left her career, and her home to follow the man she married for him to only be in and out of our lives and give her an unstable life. She currently works at a nursing home as a housekeeper, because of her language barrier since she never took time to learn it properly beacause she was busy raising us her daughters. I am now 27 and as much as I wish I was able to pay everything for her I am not able to because I now have a family and bills of my own. I am needing our friends, family, and community to please help us raise money to pay for my moms surgery which would cure her and save her life. She just celebrated her 60th birthday and I would love to have her many more years to come.</p>

<h3>Therapy for Chianna</h3>
<p>I have been battling insurance companies trying to get therapy covered for our daughter, Chianna. She has Cerebral Palsy which has caused a weakness on her right  side. She needs speech, physical and occupational therapies to better her life. Her health insurance through the State of Florida does not have enough providers available, so she has been without all the necessary therapies since October of 2011. They have been giving me the run around for months, doing everything possible to make it impossible for me to have them approve her therapy. The video above is from May 2011 when she was getting regular therapies and shows the progress she was making gaining the use of ther right hand. If we made less money, she would qualify for a different insurance that covers the therapies and is more widely accepted. Although we make more than the limit, we do not make enough to cover the $1100 a month that her therapies cost without insurance.</p>

<h3>[Your] Health Is Wealth Campaign</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><em>The Spark</em></p>
<p> Funmilola Oladini is currently in her last year at Washington University in St. Louis. The [Your] Health Is Wealth campaign stemmed from an issue she noticed when visiting her home country of Nigeria last January. During her visit, she witnessed first-hand the rapid emergence of fast-food restaurants in Ibadan and Lagos. Seeing the rapid emergence of fast-food culture among middle class Nigerians, coupled with anecdotes about family friends who suddenly died from unknown illness (often later suspected to be type 2 diabetes or hypertension) sparked her interest in examining the relationship between emergence of fast food, urbanization, and chronic health disease in Nigeria. </p>
<p><em>The Background</em></p>
<p>Diabetes and hypertension are rapidly emerging lifestyle-induced chronic diseases in sub-Saharan Africa. Prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes is as high as 11% in some urban areas in Nigeria. Even worse, the average life expectancy for someone with Type 2 diabetes in Nigeria is 8.8 years.  A recent study in a developing country has linked increased consumption of fast food to increased likelihood of diabetes. Several fast-food chains have recently established themselves in Nigeria and have been embraced by urban Nigerians who associate overeating with affluence. However, Nigeria lacks the healthcare resources needed to treat chronic disease resulting from poor diet since most health facilities are geared towards dealing with infectious disease. The current life expectancy in Nigeria is 51.9 years. This life expectancy is extremely disproportionate to its GDP, according to reports by the World Bank. </p>
<p><em>The Location</em></p>
<p>Ibadan is the third largest metropolis in Nigeria, and has been inundated with fast-food restaurants. Urban, working people of the middle-class are currently at greater risk for type 2 diabetes as compared to rural, lower class people. Less than 50% of people in sub-Saharan Africa with diabetes are aware that they have the disease, and do not know the causes and symptoms of diabetes. The <em>Health Is Wealth </em>team believes that increasing awareness through training community health advocates who will spread the knowledge within communities is the best way to encourage people to better their lifestyles.</p>
<p><em>The Plan</em></p>
<p>The <em>Health Is Wealth </em>campaign aims to increase awareness about the health detriments of fast food and sedentary lifestyle and engage Nigerians to take charge of their own health through primary prevention of chronic disease. We plan to train first year students at Adeleke University School of Public Health as community health advocates (CHAs) to promote type 2 diabetes/ hypertension prevention through lifestyle change. We will also train lay community members residing in urban Ibadan as CHAs. Once trained, the CHAs will target urban business offices to speak to workers about small steps for busy individuals to make that could greatly enhance their overall health. We will be using the community health advocate training curriculum developed by the CDC and adapting it to make it relevant for Nigerians. After training the CHAs, we plan to conduct a weekend of health seminars and health screenings. </p>
<p><em>The Goal</em></p>
<p>Our goal is to train community health advocates and maintain the relationship with them as an inlet to urban communities over the years, and to see how the community health advocates are able to influence the health habits and diabetes/ hypertension awareness of community members they come in contact with.</p>
<p> </p>

The Spark
 Funmilola Oladini is currently in her last year at Washington University in St. Louis. The [Your] Health Is Wealth campaign stemmed from an issue she noticed when visiting her home country of Nigeria last January. During her visit, she witnessed first-hand the rapid emergence of fast-food restaurants in Ibadan and Lagos. Seeing the rapid emergence of fast-food culture among middle class Nigerians, coupled with anecdotes about family friends who suddenly died from unknown illness (often later suspected to be type 2 diabetes or hypertension) sparked her interest in examining the relationship between emergence of fast food, urbanization, and chronic health disease in Nigeria. 
The Background
Diabetes and hypertension are rapidly emerging lifestyle-induced chronic diseases in sub-Saharan Africa. Prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes is as high as 11% in some urban areas in Nigeria. Even worse, the average life expectancy for someone with Type 2 diabetes in Nigeria is 8.8 years.  A recent study in a developing country has linked increased consumption of fast food to increased likelihood of diabetes. Several fast-food chains have recently established themselves in Nigeria and have been embraced by urban Nigerians who associate overeating with affluence. However, Nigeria lacks the healthcare resources needed to treat chronic disease resulting from poor diet since most health facilities are geared towards dealing with infectious disease. The current life expectancy in Nigeria is 51.9 years. This life expectancy is extremely disproportionate to its GDP, according to reports by the World Bank. 
The Location
Ibadan is the third largest metropolis in Nigeria, and has been inundated with fast-food restaurants. Urban, working people of the middle-class are currently at greater risk for type 2 diabetes as compared to rural, lower class people. Less than 50% of people in sub-Saharan Africa with diabetes are aware that they have the disease, and do not know the causes and symptoms of diabetes. The Health Is Wealth team believes that increasing awareness through training community health advocates who will spread the knowledge within communities is the best way to encourage people to better their lifestyles.
The Plan
The Health Is Wealth campaign aims to increase awareness about the health detriments of fast food and sedentary lifestyle and engage Nigerians to take charge of their own health through primary prevention of chronic disease. We plan to train first year students at Adeleke University School of Public Health as community health advocates (CHAs) to promote type 2 diabetes/ hypertension prevention through lifestyle change. We will also train lay community members residing in urban Ibadan as CHAs. Once trained, the CHAs will target urban business offices to speak to workers about small steps for busy individuals to make that could greatly enhance their overall health. We will be using the community health advocate training curriculum developed by the CDC and adapting it to make it relevant for Nigerians. After training the CHAs, we plan to conduct a weekend of health seminars and health screenings. 
The Goal
Our goal is to train community health advocates and maintain the relationship with them as an inlet to urban communities over the years, and to see how the community health advocates are able to influence the health habits and diabetes/ hypertension awareness of community members they come in contact with.
 
Where do YOU come into play?
In order for people to be open to our health sessions on prevention, we must also have sufficient health screening materials to test for the various indicators of Type 2 Diabetes and hypertension. We also hope to have some anti-diabetes medication to give out to community members who present with serious cases of diabetes. 
Already, we have begun fundraising, but we still need more to cover the costs of cholesterol screening kits and transportation for the YHIW Planning Team. 
Each cholesterol testing kit costs about $9 on average, and we are hoping to provide health seminars and health screenings to at least 200 high-risk community members in Ibadan. It would lend so much more credibility to the campaign if we are not only educating about diabetes/ hypertension, but helping diagnose people who are at high-risk for Type 2 Diabetes.
 Finally, we would like to provide compensation for the 15 individuals who volunteer as community health advocates. We would like to disburse $50 compensation  to them over the course of 5 years to incentivize them to continue their work as community health advocates. They will spend their time conducting surveys and holding healthy lifestyle/diabetes prevention sessions in the community; thus, providing remuneration is a realistic way to keep the community health advocates engaged in the campaign.
 Thus, the total amount of funds we are trying to raise for the Health Is Wealth Campaign is $2,550.
Remember, your greatest wealth is health. But do feel free to use whatever wealth you may have to enhance the health of people in need!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Adam, I run a small event management company in Yorkshire and recently my dad and step-mum adopted two disabled/terminally ill children to prevent them being alone and left in the hospital to die, since coming home with them the little boy, Josh (Pictured) was given 6 months to live from birth but passed that mark and has been getting stronger, he is now three years old and still, to doctors amazement, battling on in life. </p>

<h2 style=""margin-left: 150px;""><strong>THE PROJECT:</strong></h2>
<p>Currently the Bear Tracks Line of Protein Bars is made in a commercial kitchen where I work in a private label relationship. I make the bars but using their Kitchen and License. Perfectly Legal but does not allow me to have the production level I need to expand and more importantly to become CERTIFIED ORGANIC. In this relationship, I am limited to 4 cases of production a week and $5000 in sales ( Organic Labeling Law Exemption ) and will never be able to get the Current Kitchen to get their Kitchen Certified Organic even though everything I do in the production process is within the Organic Guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>I therefore need to get My Own Kitchen re-licensed and Certified Organic. I have used my kitchen before for Olde World Candy but it needs to be updated and modified and be Certified for Organic production.</strong></p>
<p>Once this is done my production can increase to around 20-30 cases per day and I will not be limited by the $5000 rule set forth in The Organic Labeling Laws. I will then be able to continue my conversations with two of the best Distributors in New England to represent the Bear Tracks Line of Protein Bars as well as the Coop organizations and Amazon.</p>
<h3><strong>I am in communications now with Whole Foods and Traders Joe's but need to become Certfied Organic with a much larger production Capacity than I currently have to continue with the conversations to have them sell the Bear Tracks Protein Bar Line.</strong></h3>
<p>Any Excess funding will go to Bulk Inventory purchases which will reduce my costs and ultimately the Retail Price.</p>
<p><strong>What People are Saying:</strong></p>
<p>""They ( Bear Track Protein Bars ) have no refined ingredients and no sugar added. But don’t let that fool you into thinking they have a bland taste because nothing could be further from the truth!</p>
<p>Each bar is roughly textured for a good strong crunch, but soft so you won’t break your teeth. With each bite a zing of tangy cranberries makes your mouth dance and the light crunch of sunflower seeds and organic rice crisps as the powerful taste of smooth all natural chocolate flood your senses will no doubt put a smile on your face.  For a mere 2 ounce bar you get a whopping 12 grams of high quality, complete protein!</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>Personally, over the years something has emerged and become quite clear and disturbing. Out of all the chronic diseases to plague my family and friends over 80 percent of these illnesses have attacked women. Ask a doctor ‘why is this happening?’ or ‘what is causing this?’ and they'll say it's either faulty genes or just plain bad luck.</p>
<p>Over the last 40 years and after a few billion dollars in groundbreaking research a team of courageous, almost ‘Action Hero’ like, American medical professionals are saying there is nothing that could be further from the truth.</p>
<p><em>Because a women’s body is designed to build other human beings, she is naturally predisposed to lose massive amounts of nutrients she needs for wellness via monthly cycles as well as pregnancy.</em></p>
<p>But we get everything we need from our food, right? Here’s how these medical ‘Action Hero’ guys and gals respond.</p>
<p>“One sentence has killed more people than all the wars in American History… You get all the nutrition you need from the 4 food groups!” According to the USDA from 1950 to 1999 we saw a dramatic decline in the nutrient density of our food supply, in some cases as much as 90 percent.</p>
<p><em>As a result, if these basic building blocks are not there this deficit in a women’s human being building physiology will eventually lead her into a chronic disease state. Today, we know this to be a scientific fact</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Regardless of intent, ignoring the nutritional requirements of her biology, women are effectively turned into an ATM machine for the drug companies and the Medical Industry. Today's MD directed healthcare results in the disenfranchisement of women by a medical institution that is at best incompetent and at worst corrupt.</strong></p>
<h3>The Solution<em><br/></em>
</h3>
<p>Fortunately, America is home to a gallant team of medical professionals who tell us our current model of MD directed medicine for the treatment of chronic disease is an abomination, it’s uninformed, it’s disgraceful and needs to stop yesterday. They say science has lead us into the dawn of a new understanding on health and how and how the human body works.</p>
</span></span></span></span>With their courage and passion they battle Big Pharma on one hand and save lives with the other. The US medical establishment is a 1.2 trillion dollars a year industry that wants to close the door these American medical professionals have opened.<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p>We think this story needs to be immortalized on film and we believe this information with a focus on the health needs of women, should be spread in a series of infotainment products, dubbed in multiple languages and distributed around the world.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Become a Prophet determined to STOP IT!</strong></strong></p>
<p>Get your hands on the Disease/Primary Nutrient chart. Here you can print out a chart tailored to the personality of a loved one with nine styles to choose from.

<h3>Impact</h3>
</span></span></span></span>The fact is a persistent disease state in the body is often accompanied by a mental depression and anxiety. To talk about new exciting clinically verified findings which work for everyone sounds to good to be true.

“I know you’ve been dealing with this illness for quite a while 
now. Things don’t seem to be getting better and I can tell you’re a 
little bit scared. Can you do me a favor and check out this documentary.
 And then maybe when you feel like it could you watch this DVD tell me 
what you think? Thanks, I love you…”


How would you like to put in the hands of someone who is 
suffering from a chronic disease the facts that could be instrumental 
for their recovery? Is there no greater joy or purpose in life than 
trying to save someone you love?


Hi, My name is Liam Gallegos. I represent an international network of
 Artists and Filmmakers who have launched a global campaign to bring 
awareness to a problem that affects us all.

Why Indiegogo?

Check out the trailer below. 'Paris 
Noir' is our most recent film shot in Paris, France in the summer of 
2012. Although we have successfully funded this project as well as 
various other ventures, because 
of it’s educational nature, slightly controversial subject matter and 
lengthy time commitment, using traditional funding sources for this 
campaign 
are not possible
What do you get?
Join the Crusade - Information is power
We are at the dawn of new Golden Age of knowledge and understanding on how the human body works. Here we open up this world of medical nutrition in the form of a website we have curated, at the cost of a movie just for you. It provides a framework, dispels myths and introduces you into the ortho-molecular world of clinical nutrition with links to videos and short easy to read articles.  Educate before you medicate!


It's important to look and feel AMAZING! 
For the price of taking a friend out to lunch you also get access to a second website which targets weight loss. Here we challenge you to reach for the vitality of life ASAP. The same moves that fight illness can turn you into a lean mean woo-woo machine! It's true.
On this site you will find out the names of these medical professionals we view as true blue American heroes. You get to hear them on their Health Talk radio shows with numbers to call where you can contact them concerning your health problems or the health problems of someone close to you. But the main purpose of this website is to give you the tools you need to follow a 'sure as gravity' program to lose weight and feel great. Tune in, turn on, drop out & grow rich with everything life has to offer!

 
The Problem
Personally, over the years something has emerged and become quite clear and disturbing. Out of all the chronic diseases to plague my family and friends over 80 percent of these illnesses have attacked women. Ask a doctor ‘why is this happening?’ or ‘what is causing this?’ and they'll say it's either faulty genes or just plain bad luck.
Over the last 40 years and after a few billion dollars in groundbreaking research a team of courageous, almost ‘Action Hero’ like, American medical professionals are saying there is nothing that could be further from the truth.
Because a women’s body is designed to build other human beings, she is naturally predisposed to lose massive amounts of nutrients she needs for wellness via monthly cycles as well as pregnancy.
But we get everything we need from our food, right? Here’s how these medical ‘Action Hero’ guys and gals respond.
“One sentence has killed more people than all the wars in American History… You get all the nutrition you need from the 4 food groups!” According to the USDA from 1950 to 1999 we saw a dramatic decline in the nutrient density of our food supply, in some cases as much as 90 percent.
As a result, if these basic building blocks are not there this deficit in a women’s human being building physiology will eventually lead her into a chronic disease state. Today, we know this to be a scientific fact.
Regardless of intent, ignoring the nutritional requirements of her biology, women are effectively turned into an ATM machine for the drug companies and the Medical Industry. Today's MD directed healthcare results in the disenfranchisement of women by a medical institution that is at best incompetent and at worst corrupt.
The Solution

Fortunately, America is home to a gallant team of medical professionals who tell us our current model of MD directed medicine for the treatment of chronic disease is an abomination, it’s uninformed, it’s disgraceful and needs to stop yesterday. They say science has lead us into the dawn of a new understanding on health and how and how the human body works.
With their courage and passion they battle Big Pharma on one hand and save lives with the other. The US medical establishment is a 1.2 trillion dollars a year industry that wants to close the door these American medical professionals have opened.We think this story needs to be immortalized on film and we believe this information with a focus on the health needs of women, should be spread in a series of infotainment products, dubbed in multiple languages and distributed around the world.
Become a Prophet determined to STOP IT!
Get your hands on the Disease/Primary Nutrient chart. Here you can print out a chart tailored to the personality of a loved one with nine styles to choose from. Each details the clinically verified discoveries science has made concerning the correlation of illnesses to specific nutrient deficiencies. With this information on the on the desk refrigerator or wall the idea of Clinical Nutrition will become easier for the loved ones in your life to understand.

 

Become a Fashionista Superhero! 
Be part of an elite team of fashion conscious Divas and Demigods using Original Artworks and quotations on everything from T-shirts and coffee cups to spread the word and save Humanity! Membership to this online store will be offered to Indiegogo members associated with this campaign ONLY. When people say ""WOW! Where did you get that?"" You can say, ""I'm a Superstar. It came with the job...

Impact
The fact is a persistent disease state in the body is often accompanied by a mental depression and anxiety. To talk about new exciting clinically verified findings which work for everyone sounds to good to be true. And when you're gripped with sickness and fear the chance words by themselves will resonate is difficult if not impossible to imagine. But if someone is given one of our documentaries or a Contemporary Health Education DVDs they will be able to receive this information at their leisure. The entire family can watch and learn as well.If you support and promote the structure and function of the body with the raw materials it needs every day, magic happens. We know today that it’s a scientific fact.You can help us spread this message of life, health and happiness to the women in your life, to those you love and to those who need help around the world while you power up with knowledge, health, power and enlightenment!(WARNING: The primary purpose of all Perks we offer is to engage and inform.

In Conclusion
What brought us out of the ‘Dark Ages’ was people around the world finally said, ‘Look, I don’t need no dude in a funny hat to tell me what’s up with my relationship with God. Me and God will do just fine without you.” And it’s those people who laid the foundation for personal Liberty and ended up circumnavigating the globe.
This fundamental shift in thinking was met by the Church and Royal Families who completely freaked out! They boiled people in oil, pulled them apart with horses and put Galileo under house arrest until he died. 
But the shift happened anyway.
Today, we are at the dawn of a New Renaissance happening at exponential speed. We saw the Organic food movement explode where people around the world said “Look, I don’t need no dude in a white jacket to tell me it’s OK to eat pesticides, GMO’s and growth hormones. Me and my health will do just fine without your Frankenfood.”And with every Renaissance comes an Inquisition. And today, as was way back when, we have institutions going completely mental with massive collection of private communications, a fictional financial crisis and wars that never seem to end.
But no worries...


We believe if we protect our loved ones from nutrient deficits with a special emphasis on the members of society who build other Human Beings, only good things can be a result.
The sooner we make the shift, the sooner we’ll be able to circumnavigate the Universe!
Stop the Exploitation & Save Someone You Love.

<p><strong><em>Who are you?</em></strong></p>
<p>I'm Chelsea. I'm a surfer, a communications and marketing professional, and a volunteer advocate for Sexual Assault Response Services of Southern Maine (SARSSM).</p>
<p>As a volunteer with SARSSM, I answer crisis and support line phone calls, accompany victims to the hospital, and work with victims in crisis to minimize the trauma resulting from sexual assault.</p>
<p><strong>Safe Waves</strong> will bring together my two passions — volunteering and surfing.</p>
<p><strong><em>Surfing? SARSSM? Sounds good, so what?</em></strong></p>
<p>I've been surfing for two years. After only one weekend’s worth of lessons, I bought a wetsuit and board, and I've spent every moment I can since then catching waves. (Okay, okay, mostly catching foam, but you gotta start somewhere, right?)</p>
<p>Surfing is an incredible sport — It's a solo activity with a tight-knit community. It builds confidence and strength, both physical and mental. You are in control of yourself and your board, but you are also at the will of the waves, tides, and winds. Surfing is humbling and empowering at the same time.</p>
<p>I took my first surf lessons with Wahine Kai, an all-women's surf school in Maine. I dove in with a group of first-time surfers, all women 30 years old and over. The thing I remember best about that weekend was every time a woman got up on the board for the first time, you'd hear cheering from the group, followed by ""That was AWESOME!"" from the surfer.</p>
<p>Every time: ""That was AWESOME!""</p>
<p>Those three words sum up not just the thrill of surfing, but also the hidden strength and confidence each of us discovered that day. I want to bring that once-in-a-lifetime experience to survivors of sexual assault and the advocates and volunteers who work tirelessly to help them. But to make it a reality, I’ll need some donations.</p>
<p><strong><em>So I give you money. Then what?</em></strong></p>
<p>Once you pony up, a few exciting things will follow. First is that I'll be able to make this event happen. Donations will pay for lessons, transportation, breakfast, and any swimwear or other accessories a participant may need.</p>
<p>Wahine Kai has graciously agreed to offer lessons at a huge discount for our new surfers. And the wonderful folks at SARSSM have offered to coordinate a post-surfing barbecue. I want to make this an extra-special day, so if we can all give enough, I'll be able to provide breakfast for the group, and any extra funds will be used to buy stickers or t-shirts so each participant has something to remember the day. Beyond that, leftover funds will be used as seed money for the (hopefully) next Safe Waves event.</p>
<p><strong><em>But what about ME? What do I get?</em></strong></p>
<p>Every donation gets my undying gratitude.</p>
<p>Plus, there are lots of perks for early donors - many of the perks are unique or handmade and from local businesses.</p>
<p>I will also do some one-off fundraising events this summer. Keep an eye out for details.</p>

Every other Tuesday I spent 5 days inpatient at the Huntsman Cancer Institute in Salt Lake City receiving treatment. I never thought I'd be able to do the things I enjoy again. Just 3 months after my last chemo, I walked over 20 miles in my first ""Relay for Life"". I want to help others know that you can get better and step forward. On September 12th of 2013, it will be one year since my diagnosis. To mark this bittersweet occasion, I’m going to walk more than 450 miles across my state of Nevada. It is my sincere hope that I can raise money, awareness, and provide encouragement for others on the same journey. </span>

It took her years and 50 doctors to finally recieve a proper diagnosis. I wish to do everything I can to help her. This is a desperate plea to everybody to please help me financially get her back to the U.S.A for another round of treatment. In Canada proper testing and treatment are not available. The majority of people with Lyme disease are misdiagnosed for years and by the time it is discovered it is almost too late. The very first visit to the USA that day cost me $1500. Thanks to YOU and your generous donations I was able to provide this for Heather. Monthly treatment (not including her antibiotics) suggested from the lyme doctor is hundreds of dollars on potent specialized probiotics that have to be special ordered, certain vitamins and minerals, supplements as well as a very strict NO yeast/gluten/wheat/yeast/sugar diet. Everyday she has to also juice a variety of greens so her body can absorb the nutrients properly. One teaspoon of sugar/honey/sweetner/etc can suppress Heather's immune system for 6 hours. Also she recieves monthly treatment as well from a wonderful Lyme literate Naturopath.</p>
<p>4 years ago she had a gym membership, walked 5 miles a day, hiked, spent time in nature, and constantly doing photo shoots. Now, she can't walk more than 20 minutes, becomes so fatigued far too quickly, has difficulty breathing, chest pains, migraines, her joints swell up so bad she can't write or type, difficulty folding laundry, doing dishes and playing with her cat. Something in her body is malfunctioning as her entire body is covered in edema.</p>
<p>This woman means everything to me. I can't put into words how much I love her. She is an amazing artist/photographer (<a href=""http://www.redbubble.com/people/locustgirl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.redbubble.com/people/locustgirl</a>) and a genuine pure soul and there's nothing I won't do for her. Meeting someone like this only happens once in a lifetime, and I fear her lifetime will be over soon if her medical treatment is unable to continue.</p>
<p>Donating to this compaign will ensure proper medical care and treatment and lodging while undergoing this care. It doesn't matter if it's $1 or $1000 every little bit helps. Even if you have no $ to donate, please will you post this on various social networking tools to spread the word?</p>
<p>Even while ill, both she and I helped out with other fundraisers (Rideau Valley Wildlife Sanctuary) by donating hundreds of dollars worth of her art to be sold to help treat injured wildlife. She went to college to learn how to take care of the disabled, now she is disabled.</p>
<p>She left home at 15 and she has no blood relatives who can help her, and she hasn't worked for the last 3 years due to being so ill. I am a single woman and the ONLY person who has been helping her for years, please can you help me help her? My best friend, Heather, has seen 50 doctors in the last 4 years (including 3 neurosurgeons, infectious disease doctors, rheumetologists, dermotologists, neurologists) which she was left with no definitive answers as to the root cause of all her symptoms, until now. Lyme disease, if not detected in the early stages becomes chronic lyme and ends up attacking the heart, kidneys and liver.</p>
<p>We are givers and this is very hard to ask for help. To prove this, for certain denominations I will print and mail to you your choices from Heather's photography gallery. If you love wildlife and nature or creative works combining the beautiful female form with nature, you are sure to love Heather King's artwork. Please do not place an order through RedBubble as you will be charged for the prints and you have already generously donated to this campaign. Please use Redbubble as a gallery and email me directly what prints you would like. Any questions or for a list of the prints you would like, please email me here <a href=""mailto:lockhart_ottawa@hotmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">lockhart_ottawa@hotmail.com</a></p>
<p>I promise you if you were to meet Heather you would love her almost as much as I do. I have never met another soul with such an enormous loving heart as hers. Please helps us love Kristy</p>
