<p><strong>Our story:</strong></p>
<p>Hello!,</p>
<p>My name is Salvador Domínguez one of the founders of NYC en Español: a media startup that aims to bring quality content about cultural life in New York City to Spanish-speaking viewers in both the U.S. and Latin America.</p>
<p>The inspiration for NYC en Español began six years ago when I moved to New York City, “the city where dreams come true,” from a small town in the middle of the Sonoran Desert. Life was uncertain: I didn’t have a job, a place to sleep, or much more than a suitcase full of essentials and dreams. After a tough time settling in and finding employment in the marketing/retail industry, I began to record my experiences in New York with my phone camera. I started to send short videos to my inner group of friends who encouraged me to post them on social media. The videos were a hit with my 1,000 Facebook friends, and soon I started receiving friend requests from random people, growing exponentially over the next couple weeks. I realized there was a need and demand for honest, accessible content about life in New York for the Spanish-language audience that touched on news, culture, and politics, among other topics.</p>
<p>Since my videos were intended to be watched only by my friends, they never changed in format or content. I documented my whole life, from setbacks to successes and everything and everyone in between including work, love, and living in this amazing city. As of today there are over 1,000 videos across all social media platforms. All were chosen to target specific demographics so I could help educate diverse communities with our stories.</p>
<p>While I kept my “normal job” the team soon grew to include five others who helped with video technology and editing. As more and more viewers demanded content, I soon ran out of time and resources. After being interviewed by local and national radio and television programs in Latin America, the videos took off in popularity. People in the U.S. and Latin America craved better quality, Spanish language content. With our current staffing, we could only provide limited content, and it’s time to reach and help more people with our expertise.</p>

<p><strong>What do we want to do:</strong></p>
<p>We want to take our mission of providing quality content to broader Hispanic audiences to the next level. We will share stories from successful people across diverse industries at the same time that we show everything that happens in real lives of New Yorkers. This will continue to inspire others to be successful and conquer obstacles in any stage of their lives. The format will be an innovative bilingual type of reality show divided into 12, one-hour chapters. This pilot effort will be a foundation for pitching a larger project to media networks. By building on our existing audience on various social media platforms, we hope to broadcast content with information about various causes that will contribute positively to our communities.</p>

<p><strong>Why do we need your help:</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately we had to end the show last December after five years due to rising costs.

<p>Given the demonstrated need for the media produced by NYC en Español, we concluded that this opportunity would appeal greatly to the INDIEGOGO community.

<h3>Premise</h3>
<p>A web series revolving around the story of a young introverted girl (Steph) who has never been on a date before. Being out of her comfort zone, she seeks her close friend Emily to guide her by secretly feeding her lines throughout her date. </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Creating a web series can be a difficult task to achieve. There are many challenges we have faced along our way. </p>
<p>Writing the Script:</p>
<p>Each of the three episodes has to work with each other in some way. One episode has to lead to the next episode and entice the viewers to find out what's happening in the next episode. We've gone through multiple versions of the script and hopefully we have written one that will satisfy the audience. </p>
<p>Location:</p>
<p>One of the locations we will be shooting to capture the date scene is a restaurant. To shoot at a restaurant, they have to close it during operating hours or we have to be there when they're closed. The latter would mean that we don't have any control over natural lighting and time of day. Both of these options will be costly due to us paying the business for their loss of revenue (if they're closing) or paying for staff members to supervise us.</p>
<p>Working on a small budget, finding a location that is willing to let us shoot can be very difficult. </p>

<h3>Budget</h3>
<p>This project is non-profit. 100% of all contributions will be invested into the production of the web series.</p>

We wanted to create a series that celebrates ‘Otherness’  in all of its glory and bring it into the foreground.</p><p>We believe Catrina will work best episodically rather than as a short or feature film, and have decided on a web series format because it will enable us to further explore Catrina, her friends and the world of witchcraft she discovers in depth, whilst also being accessible to the largest audience possible for free.

Maybe it all harks back to the ceremonial burning of pictures of her ex at sixteen, don't blame her blame her Scorpio rising, whose to say but her films always seem to unintentionally focus on an otherworldly power at hand. Her first film which she shot one afternoon in her parents toilet won ‘Best Film’ and ‘Best Story’ prize at the Elstree Film design and Creative England sponsored ‘A sense of Hope’ competition. She has since upgraded from toilet to confessional booth where her second self penned film Confessional was shot by Harry Baker - Cinematographer for Catrina, and directed by Louise. In fact it was on one of her first films out of drama school that Miranda met Louise, and having fallen in love with her aesthetic and way of working she knew that when she finally got round to finishing her short film about lesbian Mermaids  (coming soon after Catrina) that Louise would be the only person she would want to direct it. Louise approached Miranda with the idea to collaborate on Catrina and she jumped at the chance. </p><p> </p><h3>Louise Marie Cooke</h3><p><strong>Writer, Producer and Director</strong></p><p>Louise came of age on a diet of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and My So Called Life. It was only after watching The Virgin Suicides by Sofia Coppola that she decided she wanted to be a filmmaker and set about making a series of ‘serious’ drama short films. After graduation her first short was the Film London supported film <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tyhYvT8qTE&amp;t=10s"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>First Bite</i></a> about a teenage girl on the cusp of sexual awakening, a dreamer character, the type consumed with Twilightesque stories (serious stuff honest, no supernatural going ons...). After this she made <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhwzTrm8io4&amp;t=6s"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Siren</i></a> and <i>Pillow Talk</i> which were both nominated for Best British Short at BAFTA qualifying festival Iris Prize. In 2017 she was funded a second time by Film London to make <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgGswXoxhGE"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Breathe</i></a>, a dark drama about two strangers coming together after a tragic accident. The film was released in 2018 and is currently coming to the end of its festival run.

She starts to see them as more of a hindrance than something to boast about, especially when her new found powers start to seriously mess up her dating life. After a mysterious woman ‘Aradia’ shows up in her life,  Catrina starts to suspect that dark forces are at work, and perhaps her previously somewhat superficial appreciation of the supernatural was misguided. At the end of the season one we see Catrina faced with an ultimatum. Does she follow Aradia down the path to Wiccan Nirvana, disowning her friends and current way of life? Or does she reject her heritage and continue on the path she was happily leading.Find out your own Sun, Moon and Rising sign like Catrina here: astrostyle.com/charts-readings/free-birth-chartWe share a passion for the supernatural & fantasy genres and wanted to write in a style we loved whilst also addressing the in-balance of queer characters on TV. The focus of Catrina is not her queerness, its just one aspect of her multi-faceted character. Growing up we loved series such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, as well as films like The Craft and of course Sabrina The Teenage Witch. We wanted to create a series that celebrates ‘Otherness’  in all of its glory and bring it into the foreground.We believe Catrina will work best episodically rather than as a short or feature film, and have decided on a web series format because it will enable us to further explore Catrina, her friends and the world of witchcraft she discovers in depth, whilst also being accessible to the largest audience possible for free. We are already planning story arcs for season two and three! Louise and Miranda met in 2016 on the short film Pillow Talk which you can watch here. Louise and Miranda worked together a second time in late 2018 on another short film, Confessional, they produced together, written by Miranda and directed by Louise. The film has recently finished post-production and will begin its festival run shortly - watch the teaser here.Miranda HornWriter, Producer and lead actressMiranda has always thought of herself as a Witch. Maybe it all harks back to the ceremonial burning of pictures of her ex at sixteen, don't blame her blame her Scorpio rising, whose to say but her films always seem to unintentionally focus on an otherworldly power at hand. Her first film which she shot one afternoon in her parents toilet won ‘Best Film’ and ‘Best Story’ prize at the Elstree Film design and Creative England sponsored ‘A sense of Hope’ competition. She has since upgraded from toilet to confessional booth where her second self penned film Confessional was shot by Harry Baker - Cinematographer for Catrina, and directed by Louise. In fact it was on one of her first films out of drama school that Miranda met Louise, and having fallen in love with her aesthetic and way of working she knew that when she finally got round to finishing her short film about lesbian Mermaids  (coming soon after Catrina) that Louise would be the only person she would want to direct it. Louise approached Miranda with the idea to collaborate on Catrina and she jumped at the chance.  Louise Marie CookeWriter, Producer and DirectorLouise came of age on a diet of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and My So Called Life. It was only after watching The Virgin Suicides by Sofia Coppola that she decided she wanted to be a filmmaker and set about making a series of ‘serious’ drama short films. After graduation her first short was the Film London supported film First Bite about a teenage girl on the cusp of sexual awakening, a dreamer character, the type consumed with Twilightesque stories (serious stuff honest, no supernatural going ons...). After this she made Siren and Pillow Talk which were both nominated for Best British Short at BAFTA qualifying festival Iris Prize. In 2017 she was funded a second time by Film London to make Breathe, a dark drama about two strangers coming together after a tragic accident. The film was released in 2018 and is currently coming to the end of its festival run. Catrina will be her first time making something a little less serious and she can’t wait for the fun and magic to begin.louisemariecooke.com We have been developing Catrina since late 2018 and now have all six episodes scripted.Aside from the financial backing that we are relying on in order to create this series, crowdfunding will help us to grow our audience prior to the planned release in early 2020. As a production company Freyja Films has a great track record of gaining traction on YouTube which is where we intend to release Catrina. Pillow Talk, directed by Louise and starring Miranda has been flooded with comments asking us to create a series, so that's what we're doing! The audience for Catrina is there waiting. Young women and non-binary who are starting to discover themselves and learning who they are, just as Catrina is. We strongly believe the importance of seeing yourself and your struggles reflected on screen and we firmly feel that Catrina will provide our audience with encouragement to accept who they are.The first 20 people to support us will also receive one of these cool Queer Witch stickers gifted to us from Magic Hour This is where you come in!By supporting Catrina the Lesbian Witch and selecting one of the perks on the right, however great or small, you will get us a step closer to reaching our target of £5k which is 50% of the whole budget we need to shoot all 6 episodes.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">From award-winning filmmaker Mike Swift,</span><i style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> The Ushers </i><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">is about</span><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> that group of misfits who didn't quite make the cut for groomsmen. They venture through the wedding day with their sarcastic sidekick, a junior bridesmaid by the name of Fallon. It's a story about fitting in, making friends, and realizing what matters in life and we guarantee it'll make you laugh out loud. </span></p>
<p>Up and coming producers Helen Li and Tori Kotsen found the script through  NYU Tisch. We knew instantly it was something special that needed to be brought to life.</p>
<p>After workshopping the script and holding several successful readings, we attached and received interest from Emmy award nominated talent to the project.</p>
<p>We have been working incredibly hard on this production for over a year and have already seen interest from some very established leaders in the industry. This series is something we all truly believe in and we are confident it will be successful, but we can't do it without your help.</p>
<p>If you help contribute to our project, your donation will go towards production and post-production costs. You will have a direct impact in the creation of this web series to be pitched to networks like Netflix, IFC, HBO, and Comedy Central.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With the level of talented people that want to be a part of this series, the budget to begin producing our series is roughly $28,000. </p>
<p>Your money will be used towards equipment for cameras, lighting, and sound. It will also be applied to securing a location for the filming of the project. You will be helping with costumes and makeup as well as editing in post production. </p>
<p>Most importantly, your money will help us hire a talented cast and crew and provide them with the proper compensation they deserve for their commitment to the project. </p>
<p>In addition to being a part of a promising film project, you will also have access to the collection of amazing perks and products we have to share with our donors! You can select many different items and even have a chance to be a more integral part of the final production.</p>

Many of you are creative people who don't always have time to pursue this side of you, but this is your perfect chance to do just that by contributing and supporting independent film and art. </p>
<p>We have had success in this industry before and have never felt so passionate about a project. Mike's most recent web series was presented at Catalyst/ITV Content Fest, Brooklyn Web Fest, New Jersey Web Fest, NYC Web Fest, and more. His previous projects have garnered festival nominations for writing, directing, and cinematography, and won Best Pilot at Brooklyn Web Fest, Best Supporting Actress and  Best Series at Baltimore New Media Festival, and Best Pilot at Minnesota Web Fest. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
From award-winning filmmaker Mike Swift, The Ushers is about that group of misfits who didn't quite make the cut for groomsmen. They venture through the wedding day with their sarcastic sidekick, a junior bridesmaid by the name of Fallon. It's a story about fitting in, making friends, and realizing what matters in life and we guarantee it'll make you laugh out loud. 
Up and coming producers Helen Li and Tori Kotsen found the script through  NYU Tisch. We knew instantly it was something special that needed to be brought to life.
After workshopping the script and holding several successful readings, we attached and received interest from Emmy award nominated talent to the project.
We have been working incredibly hard on this production for over a year and have already seen interest from some very established leaders in the industry. This series is something we all truly believe in and we are confident it will be successful, but we can't do it without your help.
If you help contribute to our project, your donation will go towards production and post-production costs. You will have a direct impact in the creation of this web series to be pitched to networks like Netflix, IFC, HBO, and Comedy Central.


What We Need & What You Get
With the level of talented people that want to be a part of this series, the budget to begin producing our series is roughly $28,000. 
Your money will be used towards equipment for cameras, lighting, and sound. It will also be applied to securing a location for the filming of the project. You will be helping with costumes and makeup as well as editing in post production. 
Most importantly, your money will help us hire a talented cast and crew and provide them with the proper compensation they deserve for their commitment to the project. 
In addition to being a part of a promising film project, you will also have access to the collection of amazing perks and products we have to share with our donors! You can select many different items and even have a chance to be a more integral part of the final production.
The Impact

Storytelling has the ability to allow humans to release, actively interpret, discuss, escape, and dream in a truly powerful way. Many of you are creative people who don't always have time to pursue this side of you, but this is your perfect chance to do just that by contributing and supporting independent film and art. 
We have had success in this industry before and have never felt so passionate about a project. Mike's most recent web series was presented at Catalyst/ITV Content Fest, Brooklyn Web Fest, New Jersey Web Fest, NYC Web Fest, and more. His previous projects have garnered festival nominations for writing, directing, and cinematography, and won Best Pilot at Brooklyn Web Fest, Best Supporting Actress and  Best Series at Baltimore New Media Festival, and Best Pilot at Minnesota Web Fest. 

Tori Kotsen has produced several successful films that have just entered the festival circuit and already been selected to two. Helen Yi works with tech startup companies and is going to help bring The Ushers to an even higher level.
Comedy has always been something that helps people through rough times. Whether that be a bad day at work, a bad day at school, a break up, family problems, money trouble, or issues with friends, it's always been a place of comfort. Film, television, and web series serve as a medium for people to express themselves and also learn valuable life lessons at the same time.

Society tries to tell you what you should look like by 30 years old.....You should be college educated...You should most definitely be married  or else it may never happen....  You should have a big house, a fluffy white poodle, an impressive portfolio and working on baby #2 or #3,..or at the very least #1.......OR something must really be wrong with you!
NOT......But nevertheless, those of us in our late 20s find ourselves in a ""PRE"" midlife crises before we enter the decade of our 30s and start trying really hard not to suck by the time we get there.   It's not a bad thing to try to get your life on track on a timer,,,it's just kind of funny to watch. 
Take a ride with us, up and down and back around to Almost........... Nowhere!

 

         

Brittney is an Arkansas native who knew exactly what she wanted to do in life at 8 years old.  She received her first video camera at age 10 and has been hooked ever since.  After moving to Los Angeles,  7 years ago, waiting for opportunities that just weren't appearing, she decided to create her own magic.  After all, she is a Mass Media major who was prepped in writing, producing, filming and editing, so why not DIY?   With lots of great feedback and support from industry friends she is excited to present to the world.... Almost Nowhere.
             
Ron G is blazing a trail as one of the hottest upcoming comedians in Los Angeles. Ron began his stand up career in Atlanta, Georgia, and was crowned first place winner of the 2005 Sierra Mist Late Night Laff Off. After moving to Los Angeles to further his career as a comedian and actor, he was a finalist on Bill Bellamy’s new hit television show Who’s Got Jokes?, and was also a finalist on the most recent season of NBC’s Last Comic Standing. Having Martin Lawrence tell him he was funny is one of Ron G’s career highlights so far, and after receiving his first standing ovation only eight months in the game, he knew he had found his calling.  
Today, Ron travels the globe making people laugh, writes for the award winning CNN Show, #UnitedShades of America, and has begun to show the world his acting chops. We can't tell you everything he has recently been cast for....but look out for him. Have you watched HBO's Insecure lately? ;-) He's a STAR!
               
Krista is a Seattle native that has lived in Los Angeles for over 6 years.  She has studied acting under the highly sought after, Lesly Khan and John Kirby.  Krista never takes herself too seriously and is a comedy addict.  She has appeared in a boat-load of TV shows including, Two and a Half Men, CSI, Veronica Mars, Las Vegas, House, M.D., and the O.C......just to name a few!

Josephine is also part of an award winning web-series that she co-Executive Produced.  She enjoys comedy and sketch comedy.
               
Marché Howell is a Texas native with a background in acting and film production.  She began her career as a print model and commercial actress back home, but after only being in LA a couple of years has found her niche as a comedic goddess.   Marche' has appeared as a host on Black and Sexy TV and has co-hosted Accelerated Ratio's AskALady AskaAMan.  Just recently she wrapped up her live ensemble comedy show, Drinks with Horrible People, and on any random night you may catch her making people laugh doing stand-up around LA!

Maya Carpenter is an actress, host and producer. Though her career has been peppered with great opportunities, she is in pursuit of the one thing she was always sure of in her life, and that’s acting. She is a storyteller by nature so whether it is writing to convey a message or portraying a role that has a message, Maya finds a way to share people's stories. She’s a quirky girl with southern charm, hailing from the sunshine state of Florida. An old spirit at heart, Maya has the ability to adapt very quickly to change and is able to transform into drama-intense roles people may not see her in at first glance. When she’s not acting, writing or producing, she is steady creating ways to build her brand.  Her ultimate goal in life is to change the lives and perspectives through the gifts God has given her, she says. “God gave me this journey for a reason, and I’m going to do everything in power to fulfill His plan.”
               
Jason Mimms is a Chicago native whose acting talents and passions were first noticed by his mom at an early age.  After practically shoving the once, extremely shy, young Jason into his first acting class, he knew exactly what gifts the world needed from him and began to prepare for his journey to deliver. He began with theatrical training at the Chicago Theatre Company, formerly, a well-known black theatre on the city's South Side, he crushed the infamous stages of Chicago's Second City, and then he went on to receive a Bachelor of Arts degree in Theatre Arts from Clark-Atlanta University.
His latest work includes the role of Cam in the movie,  Boy Bye, which is currently on  Netflix, Robey Theatre Company's Knock Me A Kiss and, The Magnificent Dunbar Hotel, several commercials to mention including Credit Karma,,,and with all that going on, he is producing Almost Nowhere and is the Executive Producer/Creator/Writer of his new comedy series, ""Bad Luck"", which is slated to begin production later this fall.
           

Melkwych, which is German, because.....well his dad just liked Germany, was born and raised in Miami, Florida.  When he was just 9 years old he sent his drawings of Disney characters to Disney studios and asked for a job as an artist.  They replied with admiration and intrigue but informed him that they did not have any positions for a 9 year old.  To soften the blow, they gave him tickets to see the movie that would change his life forever........ Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!  After seeing the movie he was hooked and knew that his future was in film making.  Fast forward to the present and he has a whole slew of credits and experience and can operate just about anything on set but his greatest passion is directing.  Melkwych is excited to be a part of the Almost Nowhere family and can't wait to put on his director's hat!......And ACTION!
 
           

Teddy is a Brooklyn native that has lived in LA for a little over 5 years. He has studied at the New York Film Academy and Los Angeles Film school where his focus was cinematography.  He loves being behind the camera and views everything as art.  He is always looking for the, ""mise-enscéne.""  His over-all goal is to be one of the best cinematographers to ever do it and he wouldn't mind, one day, being compared to Roger Deakins. (Look him up)
         ......MORE AWESOME CAST & CREW
 
               


 
               
We've got a great story, an awesome cast and a really cool crew....BUT we need financial support to finish the series.  That means WE NEED YOU! Every single dollar raised will go towards producing, marketing and distributing this project.  Here's  a breakdown of how the money will be spent:

<h3>About Everyone Else Has!</h3>
<p>New York Millennials are busy AF, but the hustle doesn’t guarantee gains. Dead end jobs, broken hearts, and nihilism-tinged narcissism are ever-present.</p>
<p>Enter TJ, Delilah, Harry, and Jules. Whether they’re stalling out, hitting setbacks, or reveling in mediocrity, the one thing they can agree on is their lives are not going as planned.  Will they wake up in time to find some meaning to it all?

<h3>About Us!</h3>
<p>Logan, Ewa, Jonathan, and Mary are four NYC-based actors who met doing an Off-Off-Broadway production of a seldom performed Shakespeare play. While the show lasted only three weeks, their friendship has lasted three years. Over many late nights of coffee and conversation, they decided to create something themselves. This endeavor would have a dash more of a contemporary feel than their last project. Through improvisation, character work, and trial and error they created the characters TJ, Delilah, Harry, and Jules. Everyone Else Has is the result of four different voices collaborating to create the kind of show they’d like to not only see, but be in. After a year of writing and rewriting, they are ready for the next stage: to shoot!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Thank you for your interest in our project and we hope that, even if you don’t donate, you will come back and watch the show! We think you’ll like it. And if you DO donate, you’ll not only earn a special place in our hearts, but you’ll earn some truly amazing perks like a walk on role, poster, or cocktails with the cast!</p>

<p>Logan Keeler (co-writer/producer, actor) has lived and acted in New York for 6 years and has met every character in Everyone Else Has on the streets at least once. Originally from Maine, his two homes have made him a bit of a jack-of-all-trades, as which he can chop wood as well as he can J-walk. Both skills are competent at best. As an actor, he's had varying success here and there (credentials are available upon request) but as a co-producer/co-writer he has never been more proud than with this fledgling, yet spunky creation, Everyone Else Has. He'd like to thank Phylicia Rashad for the inspiration to make this project possible. </p>

<p>Jonathan Minton (co-writer/director, actor) is an actor, director, and writer living in Brooklyn, NY, and remembers when Everyone Else Has was just an overlong inside joke during a walk down Amsterdam. He hails from Alaska, where he created the late-night sketch comedy show The Pogo Stick, GoGo Dancer Company (aka The PoGoGoGoCo), for which he was a writer, director, and producer. His greatest claim to fame is being an extra in a Paul Sorvino film, and sitting at a table at Think Coffee in the West Village with John Cameron Mitchell for two polite hours. As a small child, Jonathan had a floppy-eared dog puppet named Whitey; today that puppet sits atop his bookshelf. He would like to dedicate this project to Whitey and extends his regrets at naming him that in the first place.</p>

<h3>We are a group of future actors, writers, musicians and directors, but first and foremost we're friends. </h3>
<ul>
<li>This is a passion project we've wanted to make for a long time. We've spent days, nights and endless WhatsApp conversations coming up with larger-than-life characters, writing silly songs, designing costume, makeup and SFX and testing out our corny sense of humour.</li>
<li>We are young people in different stages of education and employment. Unfortunately, our funds don't match our ambition, so we're asking for your help to make this show AWESOME!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>A dollar makes us wanna holler</h3>
<ul>
<li>We have estimated that for location hire, costume, props, set pieces, makeup and prosthetics, we will need around <strong>£1000</strong>. That sounds high, but it's what's known as a microbudget- believe us, you'd need almost <strong>117,000</strong> times that to make a Star Trek movie! We don't need their pro-level CGI or dedicated wranglers to handle Zachary Quinto's eyebrows, so we can be a little more modest budget-wise.</li>
<li>We're offering a whole host of fun, wacky perks. Everything from a producer credit to a shoutout to signed art to- gasp- <i>MERCH</i>! Also included is the opportunity to protect yourself from the upcoming robot apocalypse- don't say we didn't warn you!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Why is this so gosh-darn important to us?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Between us, we have an award-nominated filmmaker and props artist, BFI Film Academy graduate, a Touring Theatre student, a recording artist who studies at the Identity School of Acting by day, a writer/actress/director on her way to acting school, a fully-fledged actor/writer with a host of professional credits and a musician who has produced work for countless short films and videos. Not bad for a team with an average age of <strong>19.8</strong>! </li>
<li>We are all self-made creators- we weren't handed anything, nobody held our hand or spoon-fed us to get us to where we are. We worked to achieve everything we have today and this is only the next step to our <strong>TOTAL WORLD DOMINATION!... </strong>Or just having a great career! That's cool too!</li>
</ul>

This is a passion project we've wanted to make for a long time. We've spent days, nights and endless WhatsApp conversations coming up with larger-than-life characters, writing silly songs, designing costume, makeup and SFX and testing out our corny sense of humour.
We are young people in different stages of education and employment. Unfortunately, our funds don't match our ambition, so we're asking for your help to make this show AWESOME!


A dollar makes us wanna holler

We have estimated that for location hire, costume, props, set pieces, makeup and prosthetics, we will need around £1000. That sounds high, but it's what's known as a microbudget- believe us, you'd need almost 117,000 times that to make a Star Trek movie! We don't need their pro-level CGI or dedicated wranglers to handle Zachary Quinto's eyebrows, so we can be a little more modest budget-wise.
We're offering a whole host of fun, wacky perks. Everything from a producer credit to a shoutout to signed art to- gasp- MERCH! Also included is the opportunity to protect yourself from the upcoming robot apocalypse- don't say we didn't warn you!


Why is this so gosh-darn important to us?

Between us, we have an award-nominated filmmaker and props artist, BFI Film Academy graduate, a Touring Theatre student, a recording artist who studies at the Identity School of Acting by day, a writer/actress/director on her way to acting school, a fully-fledged actor/writer with a host of professional credits and a musician who has produced work for countless short films and videos. Not bad for a team with an average age of 19.8! 
We are all self-made creators- we weren't handed anything, nobody held our hand or spoon-fed us to get us to where we are. We worked to achieve everything we have today and this is only the next step to our TOTAL WORLD DOMINATION!... Or just having a great career! That's cool too!

<h3>Short Project Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Zach Letter. I've been a career entertainer for nearly 10 years. And a firm believer in cryptocurrency for longer than I can remember. With my two passions of crypto and entertainment, I created CCN. But I want more, more for the viewer and more for this great community. So I'm setting out to create the most informative, reliable and trustworthy news network on planet Earth! I'm looking to deliver a professional Crypto News broadcast of 30 minutes in length once a day to all the crypto believers out there. With a news set, professional broadcasters, a full production crew and a load of researchers. To bring you the best crypto news out there!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why We're Fundraising</h3>
<p>Funding is important to such a grand initiative such as this. As the creator of CCN I'm putting $40,000 of my own money into the start of this project. But that's nowhere near the cost of starting something as bold as this. So that's where I reach out to you, a very loyal supporter of CCN, myself and cryptocurrency. I want to create a mainstream pro crypto news show, that helps eliminate FUD. The money pledged by you, will go to helping bring this dream to life.</p>
<h3>The Budget</h3>
<p>30% - Funding a professional studio space to build out an amazing news set!</p>
<p>35% - Funding the salary of 2 professional crypto researchers and 1 additional broadcaster!</p>
<p>30% - Funding Production such as lights, camera's and operators of said equipment and salary!</p>
<p>05% - Funding Campaign Rewards</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If we're able to fund this dream, we'll become a one stop shop of cryptocurrency news. The only source you'll need, to keep you informed on everything crypto! With 3 cryptocurrency videos a day and then the 30 MINUTE LONG Crypto Evening News you'll have your crypto fill everyday! We're looking to set a new standard in the crypto entertainment and information market!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>Of course we'll face challenges, such as finding great researchers and one additional broadcaster. Plus trying to turn around relevant professional content everyday. But with your help I know we'll be able to produce the show of our dreams. A show you deserve!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you've decided to pledge to our dream and help make it a reality, thank you! And if you're looking to help more, share this campaign EVERYWHERE! Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and around the water cooler at work. All are appreicated. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Jay Alexander Fernandez (a.k.a. Xander) and I am a proud native of Ponce, Puerto Rico. Since I was just a kid to this day, I've looked to create stories that can make an audience think out of the norm in order to obtain a new and unforgettable lesson. Because I strongly believe a story is one of the most unique elements in any piece of art; with the power to touch a person’s heart or even tear it apart. My main focus has always been to do one or the other. Xander's Eye Productions is just an extension of myself as an artist. Love Element is just one of the more efficient steps my team and I plan to take in order to not only provide audiences with a compelling parallel on life and its hidden meanings, but also literal expression full of deep and relatable emotions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Love Element, carries a heavy amount of symbolic factors that will naturally allow audiences to relate to what they see on screen, while still being entertained with a  metaphoric visual representation of our planet.</li>
<li>All of this will be shown through expression, movement, and setting! In an essence the episodes will be pantomimes broken into five different episodes: Earth I, Water II, Air III, Fire IV, and Love Element V.   </li>
<li>I have worked on the script for this series for almost two years now. It began as a small idea dealing with how most of us as humans can become unaware of the fact that things much bigger than us have happened, are happening, and will continue to happen through existence; that this planet holds emotion and expression just like each of us. All in all, I intend to repay each contributor that shares this vision by simply creating something worth sharing with the world, for world. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Realistically, my team and I need around $10,000 to produce this series; However, we seek at least $6,000 of that. With that budget actors can be supplied a fair payment as well as flat rates for the crew's work and time; Not to mention gas, food, props, set-design, and most of all, emergencies. If our financial goal is achieved or exceeded, then our team will be able to comfortably travel and hire/collaborate with out of state production crews allowing us to shoot on specific locations across the U.S.</li>
<li>As you possibly wonder why we need to travel, let me emphasize that traveling to different regions will be crucial for this series. I have always been a huge advocate for picking specific locations allowing proper staging according to whatever script is at work. Locations for this series need to be authentic considering the story will take place almost entirely in nature.</li>
<li>We as a team wish to create the right aesthetic in order create the movie magic this story deserves. For the most part, each episode will introduce a new element, hence presenting a new location/aesthetic.</li>
<li>Anyone who contributes past a certain donation amount will be given access to a variety of perks such as (Free access to our 5 premieres beginning as early as April, 2019 | Signed poster by the cast and director | Film Credit along with a personalized gift from the writer/director himself | T-Shirt | In-Person or Virtual Q&amp;A with the leadership team and full cast) </li>
<li>If all Earth fails, pun intended, and our team doesn't reach the financial goal of at least $6,000, my leadership team and I will make absolutely sure that whatever amount we had the privilege of earning, no matter how much, will be used in the most efficient way possible, not to mention I as a responsible director would be sure to have a sit-down with my creative department and ensure we take away anything that isn't necessary from the script in order for the story to deliver beautifully avoiding any lack in the quality promised to audiences. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>This project isn't just about achieving a well-produced web series, it is about spreading a handful of messages directly correlating to our society today. Since the beginning of time darkness has always existed, but it is always strongest in its present time, and for that reason pain has spread around the world more than ever causing disruption in our hearts, in our lives; but love really is a powerful force, and it has been offered to us constantly since we were first brought into existence. Signs point to a path full of peace awaiting in our universe; the knowlege to find it is within us, if only we'd learn to to search in the dark.</li>
<li>The truth is, my biggest wish in life is to one day earn the chance to properly craft something powerful and compelling; the beginning to a future full of more stories with the soul purpose of touching a person's heart; whatever way that might be. </li>
<li>Yet I recognize that our team cannot achieve this with the snap of a finger or even a well-structured plan. We also need trust; For all we seek is chance to express ourselves as professionals in a way that is unique and wholeheartedly. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As much as we believe in our vision, we are also aware that this production is bound to have its obstacles; As does every production ever made. Factors such as permits, liability, and security have been accounted for since the start. Which is why this cannot be possible without a proper foundation and resources, beginning with a reasonable and manageable budget. </p>
<ul>
<li>My team and I have been very selective about how we plan to bring forth such an ambiguous concept. As the one who first presented the idea of producing a series titled ""Love Element"", I find it crucial that my team has access to the necessary tools and security they need in order to prosper as professionals/artists throughout the production of this series.</li>
<li>I have chosen a very specific roster of talented artists, each specialized in different areas of a production, all for the benefit of the project. All in all, I feel nothing but full confidence that our leadership combined will be the key to a memorable end result. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>I understand that contributing can be a sacrifice to some. In fact, I can relate being a young but aspiring artist, responsible of evenly balancing my craft with my personal life. But it doesn't take more than a few minutes or even seconds to help my team and I share this campaign and its goal to achieve this opportunity in our career. We appreciate any effort made to make the world aware of our mission. </li>
<li>Keep in mind that Indiegogo offers share tools to help anyone promote this project as well as many others on the site. </li>

<p>Vinnie's life is miserable. He's been busting his chops for nearly 7000 years, worked to the bone in the corporation that is Hell. And yet, he gets no reward other than a snooty new dead woman to look after. </p>
<p>6 episodes of this comedy will be shot in 2019. We're a non profit, indie group so any contribution we will get will go towards actor's lunches, equipment and lights. </p>
<p>Hell Inc is the brainchild of Ronika, our head writer and producer, who has slaved overt he script for the better part of 2018 and now wants to make it become a reality. </p>
<p>We are all in it for the passion of filmmaking and because making people laugh is the best way to get close to them. </p>

<h3>One Hell of a Ride</h3>
<p>We are deep into preproduction, with the first rehearsals starting just after Christmas.</p>
<p>We were lucky to be able to rehearse in the location we're actually going to be shooting in (shout out to awesome MD7 Dublin!), so we saved a lot of money on that front. </p>
<p>The rest of our (as of yet, non-existent) budget will go towards: </p>
<ul>
<li>Editing: The edit is the life blood of each production, as the script is the bone structure. Without a solid and highly qualified editor we are doomed to mediocre results. We won't have that, and if it's the last thing we do!</li>
<li>Camera and Lights: Since we are all involved in the indie film business, we do have equipment available to us, but... it's old. It's got little aches and pains. So any funds we will receive will help us get/rent better cameras to bring you even closer into Hell! </li>
</ul>
<p>Our main goal here is to bring you a comedy that will get your heart thumping and get your fists clenched. You will love to hate these quirky characters. We sure do!</p>
<p>Ever cent we are given will go into this project. It will be made, regardless of how much contribution we receive. But it will be made a lot better with your help!</p>

<p>Yuppies was created and directed by Colin Bowles and is made up of a cast of improvisers and actors in Chicago, and was made possible with help from talented friends and colleagues. Here's about how things went down:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Sept. 10, 2017: </strong> Colin moves to Chicago and begins working at The Second City</li>
<li>
<strong>Oct. 28, 2017:</strong> Colin begins writing initial versions of  scripts for ""Yuppies""</li>
<li>
<strong>Nov. 23, 2017: </strong>Colin makes new friends / future cast members</li>
<li>
<strong>Jan. 28, 2018: </strong>Script is finalized (as much as an improvised script can be)</li>
<li>
<strong>March 3, 2018:</strong> Cast is finalized, crew is amazing</li>
<li>
<strong>May 4, 2018:</strong> Camera tests BEGIN!</li>
<li>
<strong>June 6, 2018: </strong>Filming begins!</li>
<li>
<strong>June - September 2018: </strong>shoots are scheduled, actors arrive, pizza is ordered, producers find locations, DP sets up cameras, crew gets good at holding mics, car is rented, cat is borrowed (shoutout Countess Olenska), talented people arrive, talented people say lines, talented people improvise lines, cast and crew goes to the beach, cast and crew goes to on a ferris wheel</li>
<li>
<strong>Sept. 14, 2018: </strong>THAT'S A WRAP!</li>
<li>
<strong>Oct. 1, 2018: </strong>We realize things are expensive and we need more money</li>
</ul>

<p>We'll start by saying WE TRIED. Over $3,000 of personal, hard-earned money has been lovingly poured into Yuppies, but that number has turned into a single digit during production. We've put off starting a crowdfunding campaign (such as this) for as long as possible and have called in every favor to keep our expenditures low, but everything costs something and we think the hardworking people involved deserve at least a little payback.</p>
<p>Every penny of your generous contribution will go towards at least one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>festival submission fees</li>
<li>post-production costs (such as music, graphic design, videography)</li>
<li>transportation</li>
<li>location costs and rental</li>
<li>repaying professionals (the ones who have been doing favors and haven't asked for more money, but we think they deserve to be paid)</li>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Thank you for checking out this kickstarter and checking out Yuppies. As someone who has never done this before, this has been one of the most amazing/stressful experiences of my life. As some of you know, this art project has been extremely personal and honestly quit scary - but the support from family, friends, and this crew has been amazing. I owe so much to the people that have helped with this. If you choose to donate, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. If not, I hope you follow our journey on social media and check out Yuppies!</p>
<p>Cheers!<br/>Colin</p>

</div></div>","Yuppies was created and directed by Colin Bowles and is made up of a cast of improvisers and actors in Chicago, and was made possible with help from talented friends and colleagues. Here's about how things went down:


Sept. 10, 2017:  Colin moves to Chicago and begins working at The Second City

Oct. 28, 2017: Colin begins writing initial versions of  scripts for ""Yuppies""

Nov. 23, 2017: Colin makes new friends / future cast members

Jan. 28, 2018: Script is finalized (as much as an improvised script can be)

March 3, 2018: Cast is finalized, crew is amazing

May 4, 2018: Camera tests BEGIN!

June 6, 2018: Filming begins!

June - September 2018: shoots are scheduled, actors arrive, pizza is ordered, producers find locations, DP sets up cameras, crew gets good at holding mics, car is rented, cat is borrowed (shoutout Countess Olenska), talented people arrive, talented people say lines, talented people improvise lines, cast and crew goes to the beach, cast and crew goes to on a ferris wheel

Sept. 14, 2018: THAT'S A WRAP!

Oct. 1, 2018: We realize things are expensive and we need more money


We'll start by saying WE TRIED. Over $3,000 of personal, hard-earned money has been lovingly poured into Yuppies, but that number has turned into a single digit during production. We've put off starting a crowdfunding campaign (such as this) for as long as possible and have called in every favor to keep our expenditures low, but everything costs something and we think the hardworking people involved deserve at least a little payback.
Every penny of your generous contribution will go towards at least one of the following:

festival submission fees
post-production costs (such as music, graphic design, videography)
transportation
location costs and rental
repaying professionals (the ones who have been doing favors and haven't asked for more money, but we think they deserve to be paid)

<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>Hello! If you don't already know me, my name is Elise Taff and I am a bartender and actor living in New York City. Last year I launched my webseries, Strug-Free Cocktails and it was a blast! (If you haven't seen it yet - watch it <a href=""http://www.estrugs.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>!) My goal was to teach people how to make cocktails in a fun, approachable way, but I couldn't have imagined the scope of people I've been able to connect with because of this webseries. I funded the first Season of Strug-Free Cocktails on my own, and now I need your help to make Season 2 even better (and of course, strugglier)!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Funding for this project will go towards hiring a crew, equipment, set decorating, alcohol (duh!) makeup, and editing! I already work with a fantastic production company, Halleloo, and after trying out some stuff on my own, I know I am better and funnier with them (and don't we want that?) </p>
<p>As a thank you for helping me fund Strug-Free Cocktails, I have some awesome perks that aren't just a shout out in the comments. Strug-Free Cocktails is here to help you have a strug-free day, so I am not going to leave you high and dry. Every donation over $20 will send you home with either my Strug-Free Spirit Guide or a free copy of my e-book, a full recipe book of all of the cocktails from Season 1.</p>

<p>If you can't contribute, or if you want to help spread the word please help by sharing this campaign on any or all of your social media platforms.

<h2>Wait, what do you mean video personals??</h2>
<p>Love in the modern world is all about online dating, from dating sites to dating apps, Literary Personals takes this idea to the world of Classic Literature! Here you will find the charterers you know and love attempting to find love, in the most modern way possible, online dating! We have kept them in the time periods they hail from, full of the personalities you love, sometimes exploring what *might* have happened after that last page...</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>Literary Personals was created by Jennifer Anne Scott, an actress and self avowed book worm, with a crazy idea and a <i>lot</i> of determination! Jennifer enlisted the many talented actors and actresses, crew and make-up artists she has met working in Hollywood, bribing them with food, fun and the chance to wear amazing costumes and the promise of comedic glory!! </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What exactly is the show?</h3>
<p>The show consists of ""micro shorts"" from famous literary characters, explaining to camera what they are looking for when it comes to love. Our amazing actors and actresses will be portraying characters from books and plays through out history, and giving you the chance to interact with them. The website, LiteraryPersonals.com not only hosts the personals ads themselves, but gives each character an actual ad that you can respond to from all the characters.  This will then lead to additional shorts of the characters responding to the inquiries they receive!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>This is what we have done so far...</h3>
<p>We have filmed the first series, Shakespeare Personals and they are live on the webpage at www,LiteraryPersonals.com. They feature Nick Bottom, Hamlet, Beatrice, Titania, Bianca, Richard III, Mercutio, Viola and Horatio kicking off the show on April 23rd in celebration of Shakespeare Day!!! Additional characters are being added this month to finish this first series!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What we need to release episodes weekly :</h3>
<p>Bribery will only get you so far, and we need your help to continue filming this show!! All money is going back into the show, to make  to pay for things such as :</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying the Actors! These amazing people have so far donated their time, and I want to pay them in more than food &amp; credits!! </li>
<li>The crew - Camera, Sound, Makeup, Production Assistants, these are the people that make the show look good, sound good, and keep it running smoothly!! </li>
<li>Studio rental ,costuming, and feeding everyone!! These are some of the many additional costs associated with filming the show.</li>
</ul>
<p>The great thing about this Indigogo campaign is even *if* we don't reach our entire goal, the funds will still go into the show and allow us to continue filming for as long as possible. The show must go on! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Spreading the love of Literature...</h3>
<p>We hope by making characters more relatable, and putting them in a setting more familiar to modern audiences, that we will inspire people to explore the amazing works that each of the come from. In our media obessed world people are more likely to have seen ""the movie based on.."" than read the actual book. There is room for both, and we hope to share this love of books  with the world! So many films and  TV shows draw inspiration from classic literature, we hope to bring the originals back into the conversation!</p>

<p>Hi We are the crew of 2-G Digital Media, Inc. We've been producing film and television content since 2001. We've had films in Blockbuster, Hollywood Video, Walmart and Best Buy. We've recently had a string of bad experiences with traditional distribution and decided it was time for us to take control of our own destiny.</p>
<p>With the help of our friends at Amazon, we've been able to shoot a 4 episode season of Music &amp; Murder and distribute it through Amazon. Season 1 is currently streaming and can be watched on Amazon Prime and Amazon Instant Video. We have over 7 million minutes viewed and over 500,000 unique streams. We have a 3.5 star rating and with your help we'd like to get as close to 5 stars as possible.  With your help we have the ability to get to 5 million unique streams per month and put the show and the Atlanta indie production scene on the map. Most importantly your support will allow aspiring actors and crew members the chance to practice their craft and showcase their talents to a worldwide audience.</p>
<p><strong>What is Music &amp; Murder?</strong></p>
<p>""In the streets of Atlanta, Money &amp; Violence go Hand in Hand. Chastity Michaels is one of the best video producers in Atlanta, but when she gets pushed by the streets, she pushes back.

When , a music video producer in Atlanta gets framed for murder her family and friends rally together to keep her out of jail and find the people who framed her for murder.</p>

<h3>The State of Indie Filmmaking </h3>
<p>We've been making independent content for over 10 years now and we've notice how harder it gets every year to get your tv show or film distributed to the world. Once upon a time a distributor would pay you a healthy advance for your hard work and creativity. Today, few and far between offer any up from money for your film. Well we're here to say we don't need them anymore!</p>
<p>We want to show the world that indie productions are viable and can make money. We want to show that there is a market for indie content and we want to show other indie production companies that there's a new formula for success as independent film producer.</p>
<p>Showing and proving is the 1st step in our vision. Step # 2 is to be a part of the change. We intend to use a portion of what we make to pay it forward and help other producers get their content on Amazon and other platforms. We'll help with marketing campaigns and provide production support as needed.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurial filmmaking is all we love and we're asking for the support of like minded people like you to help us and this movement of creating great indie content!</p>

</div></div>","Welcome to 2-G!
Hi We are the crew of 2-G Digital Media, Inc. We've been producing film and television content since 2001. We've had films in Blockbuster, Hollywood Video, Walmart and Best Buy. We've recently had a string of bad experiences with traditional distribution and decided it was time for us to take control of our own destiny.
With the help of our friends at Amazon, we've been able to shoot a 4 episode season of Music & Murder and distribute it through Amazon. Season 1 is currently streaming and can be watched on Amazon Prime and Amazon Instant Video. We have over 7 million minutes viewed and over 500,000 unique streams. We have a 3.5 star rating and with your help we'd like to get as close to 5 stars as possible.  With your help we have the ability to get to 5 million unique streams per month and put the show and the Atlanta indie production scene on the map. Most importantly your support will allow aspiring actors and crew members the chance to practice their craft and showcase their talents to a worldwide audience.
What is Music & Murder?
""In the streets of Atlanta, Money & Violence go Hand in Hand. Chastity Michaels is one of the best video producers in Atlanta, but when she gets pushed by the streets, she pushes back. Music & Murder is an Urban Crime drama about Chastity Michaels and Venom studios. When , a music video producer in Atlanta gets framed for murder her family and friends rally together to keep her out of jail and find the people who framed her for murder.
This series is a cross between the TV shows ""Power"", Empire and ""How to Get Away with Murder"", so if you like juicy tv dramas, you won't want to miss ‪#YourNewTVAddiction!

 
WE LOVE WHAT WE DO, BUT...
 

Rahiem (Grandmaser Flash and the Furious 5 & Platinum Producer Stephen ""Stix Josey"" on set.
WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT!
We're seeking production funds in the amount of $15,000 to cover our production costs such as:
1. Equipment Purchase & Rentals: $4,000.00
(2) 4k Cameras
(2) 3000 Watt Light Kits
(1) Audio Package
-Tascam Recorder
-(4) Wireless Lavaliers
-Boom Pole & Shotgun Mic
2. Cast: $6,000.00
3. Marketing: $5,000.00
If we don't reach our entire goal, we will use the funds proportionately in each category. Instead of buying, we'll rent equipment and we will reduce our marketing budget as needed.

Supa Peach from Jermaine Dupri's ""The Rap Game"" on set.
What You Get!In return for your awesome and generous support we're offering fun and pretty DOPE perks and opportunities. For instance, we shout you out all over social media for a $25 donation, but the dopeness doesn't stop there! Want to direct an episode of Music & Murder? Here's your chance! We have perks from everything to a DVD of both seasons to all inclusive flights and hotels to be on set and at special screening of the season 2 premiere!   
The State of Indie Filmmaking 
We've been making independent content for over 10 years now and we've notice how harder it gets every year to get your tv show or film distributed to the world. Once upon a time a distributor would pay you a healthy advance for your hard work and creativity. Today, few and far between offer any up from money for your film. Well we're here to say we don't need them anymore!
We want to show the world that indie productions are viable and can make money. We want to show that there is a market for indie content and we want to show other indie production companies that there's a new formula for success as independent film producer.
Showing and proving is the 1st step in our vision. Step # 2 is to be a part of the change. We intend to use a portion of what we make to pay it forward and help other producers get their content on Amazon and other platforms. We'll help with marketing campaigns and provide production support as needed.
Entrepreneurial filmmaking is all we love and we're asking for the support of like minded people like you to help us and this movement of creating great indie content!

<h3>Okay, but why? Why now? Why this sperm?</h3>
<p>The night is dark and full of terrors. We all need the clowns to make us laugh.  Yes, the actual Avengers are fun and funny, but they also go dark and devote entire films to Tony Stark agonizing over his role in the death of a child. </p>
<p>The Amehngers are pure, silly fun.  Our motto is no angsting, no brooding, and absolutely no dead children. </p>
<p>Also, the real Avengers, while lovely to look at, are  frankly, TOO awesome.  We regular people are not as beautiful as the Black Widow or as buff as the Black Panther. Nobody loves us the way Cap loves Bucky. The Amehngers are attainable, relatable heroes. They put the human in superhuman. </p>
<p>In this age of gritty reboots and imminent global thermonuclear war, the Amehngers are here to make you giggle, and even sometimes guffaw, for 5-7 minutes.  </p>
<h3>Short Version, If You Don't Want to Read A Lot</h3>
<ol></ol>
</div><div>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1515689849/dsledtbr9cbiabtfxm1h.png"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3>Long Version, If You're Into Words</h3>
<p>There was an idea, to come up with a skit about superheroes with goofy powers, and see if it could become something more. To see if two people could work together and write the scripts that no one else could. </p>
<p>Three years later, here we are. </p>
<h3>What Are You Going to Do With the Money?</h3>
<p>This is a really ambitious project with a large primary cast, guest roles in every episode, multiple locations, and some moderate SFX. </p>
<p>Even with leveraging every connection we have, and a cast and crew willing to work for nominal fees, we need quite a bit of cash to pull this off. </p>
<p>Budget Breakdown:</p>
<p>Equipment rental - $5,000 - this includes cameras and rigs, lighting and sound</p>
<p>Cast and Crew - $15,300 - this is the biggie.  Our show has six principal characters that appear in almost every episode, as well as one recurring character and six guest stars for the season. We have extras too, but we aren't paying them (sorry extras!).  Crew includes the director, assistant director, director of photography,  location scout, lighting crew, sound crew, hair/makeup/wardrobe, and production designer.  </p>
<p>Everyone involved in the production is working for a nominal fee, because they love and believe in the production, but even those rates, times 20+ people, add up. </p>
<p>Locations, props, sets, costumes - $3,500.  Most of the action takes place in the Amehngers basement apartment, but in season 1, they foil a bank robbery, stop a museum heist in progress, challenge a villain to a showdown in the street, and battle demonic mimes in a park. All while wearing clothes!</p>
<p>Insurance, Legal, Admin Fees  - $2,500. The bulk of this expense are the fees Indiegogo charges to collect and process your contributions. We also need to purchase insurance for the production in case anybody trips and falls or breaks that equipment we rented. </p>
<p>Food - $3,000 - Remember those 20+ people? They need to be fed, every day they are working on set. We are looking at 8 shooting days, which breaks down to $375 per day. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What's In it For Me?</h3>
<ul>
<li>You'll get to watch a funny web series with good production values. </li>
<li>You'll get one, some, or all of the nifty perks on our perks page. </li>
<li>You'll get to watch the series again and spot all the cool stuff in the background and subtle jokes and references you missed the first time that only you are smart enough to get. </li>
<li>You'll get in on the ground floor of a whole new fandom.  How often does that happen?  You can be our BNF! </li>
<li>You'll laugh. Seriously y'all (were from Texas so that's authentic), this is a downright joyful production. If you laugh half as much watching it as we have creating it, your money will have been well spent. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are no risks. This will be a seamless production and nothing will go wrong.  Ha! Of course not. This is filmmaking. All kinds of things are going to go wrong. We're going to get behind schedule some days,  it's going to rain when we need it to be sunny, ideas that sounded amazing will turn out lame on camera.</p>
<p>All that has already happened, just in the filming of the pitch video. But that just means we already know how to haul our butts over those obstacles when they pop up. </p>
<p>The most significant risk is that we will not reach our funding goal. If that is the case, our plan is to produce as many episodes as we can without compromising production values or failing to compensate our cast and crew.  </p>
<h3>What If You Surpass Your Goal?</h3>
<p>OMG that would be awesome.  If we surpass our goal, we will apply those funds to Season 2! We have planned a multi-season arc for these characters, and hope our audience will be along for the full ride.   Indiegogo allows campaigns that meet their funding goal to continue raising funds through their InDemand platform and that is our desired outcome for this project. </p>
<h3>Wait, Can You Even Do This?</h3>
<p>We are not affiliated with Marvel Entertainment. Our project is a parody and as such, is afforded certain protections under the doctrine of Fair Use. This is a not-for-profit production; we aren't lining our shoes with the money. All funds raised, whether by crowdfunding, income from streaming services, or passing the hat (which we are NOT above) will be used for the production. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>I'm Sold! How Can I Help?</h3>
<p>Fork over the cash, of course. But if you cannot contribute funds at this time, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share our campaign on your social media or via email,  along with a personal message from you, and<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LettuceGoProductions/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> like us on Facebook</a>.</li>
<li>Offer an in-kind contribution of a location, props or catering (contact us to work out the details). </li>
<li>Watch the series when it airs and tell everyone you know how awesome it is!</li>

Long Version, If You're Into Words
There was an idea, to come up with a skit about superheroes with goofy powers, and see if it could become something more. To see if two people could work together and write the scripts that no one else could. 
Three years later, here we are. 
What Are You Going to Do With the Money?
This is a really ambitious project with a large primary cast, guest roles in every episode, multiple locations, and some moderate SFX. 
Even with leveraging every connection we have, and a cast and crew willing to work for nominal fees, we need quite a bit of cash to pull this off. 
Budget Breakdown:
Equipment rental - $5,000 - this includes cameras and rigs, lighting and sound
Cast and Crew - $15,300 - this is the biggie.  Our show has six principal characters that appear in almost every episode, as well as one recurring character and six guest stars for the season. We have extras too, but we aren't paying them (sorry extras!).  Crew includes the director, assistant director, director of photography,  location scout, lighting crew, sound crew, hair/makeup/wardrobe, and production designer.  
Everyone involved in the production is working for a nominal fee, because they love and believe in the production, but even those rates, times 20+ people, add up. 
Locations, props, sets, costumes - $3,500.  Most of the action takes place in the Amehngers basement apartment, but in season 1, they foil a bank robbery, stop a museum heist in progress, challenge a villain to a showdown in the street, and battle demonic mimes in a park. All while wearing clothes!
Insurance, Legal, Admin Fees  - $2,500. The bulk of this expense are the fees Indiegogo charges to collect and process your contributions. We also need to purchase insurance for the production in case anybody trips and falls or breaks that equipment we rented. 
Food - $3,000 - Remember those 20+ people? They need to be fed, every day they are working on set. We are looking at 8 shooting days, which breaks down to $375 per day. 
 
What's In it For Me?

You'll get to watch a funny web series with good production values. 
You'll get one, some, or all of the nifty perks on our perks page. 
You'll get to watch the series again and spot all the cool stuff in the background and subtle jokes and references you missed the first time that only you are smart enough to get. 
You'll get in on the ground floor of a whole new fandom.  How often does that happen?  You can be our BNF! 
You'll laugh. Seriously y'all (were from Texas so that's authentic), this is a downright joyful production. If you laugh half as much watching it as we have creating it, your money will have been well spent. 


Who Are You People, Anyway?
We are an autonomous collective, taking it in turns to act as an executive officer of the week.  You're in good hands. Just look at the quality of our headshots!
The Amehngers is a collaboration between Lettuce Go Productions and ChancePants. 

Chance Barnett, Creator, Producer, Editor
Chance is a graduate of the KD Conservatory Film School, creator of the ChancePants Youtube channel and banned in over 100 countries (edgy!) He created an award-winning commercial for Lost Paws, an animal rescue organization (don't breed or buy while shelter pets die!) and his influences are Sam Raimi, Steven Spielberg and James Cameron. 

Barbara McCormick Thomas, Writer, Producer
Barbara's films have screened in festivals throughout the US and the  United Kingdom and even won a bunch of awards that all went to the director and she's fine with that, really. Her plays have been staged by Rover DramaWerks and the Small But Mighty theater company of Toronto. She has also written for the nationally syndicated top forty radio program, Kidd Kraddick in the Morning. Barbara is a partner in Lettuce Go Productions. You can tell she wrote the bios because hers is the longest.

Todd Slaughter, Producer, Post Production Wizard
Todd is a media developer, animator, illustrator, dreamweaver, Unix speaker, space cowboy. Most recently, he has been developing educational videos for Edmentum, a provider of online learning programs. Todd is a partner in Lettuce Go Productions.
The Cast 

Clockwise from top left: George William Phillips III as Mr. Prepared; Gwen Moores as Temperate Girl; Francis Reza as The Arborist; Brenna Leigh Whitten as Galendar; Kayla Smith as Pre-Teen Girl; and Makenzie McClure as the Silver Screamer. 
Our heroes get their Mission of the Day from crack journalist Jocelyn Townsie (played by Jocelyn Townsie) who reports for ENN - the Exposition News Network.  

Learn more about our cast at our Facebook page. But later - don't leave this page until you've made a contribution! 
 

Risks & Challenges
There are no risks. This will be a seamless production and nothing will go wrong.  Ha! Of course not. This is filmmaking. All kinds of things are going to go wrong. We're going to get behind schedule some days,  it's going to rain when we need it to be sunny, ideas that sounded amazing will turn out lame on camera.
All that has already happened, just in the filming of the pitch video. But that just means we already know how to haul our butts over those obstacles when they pop up. 
The most significant risk is that we will not reach our funding goal. If that is the case, our plan is to produce as many episodes as we can without compromising production values or failing to compensate our cast and crew.  
What If You Surpass Your Goal?
OMG that would be awesome.  If we surpass our goal, we will apply those funds to Season 2! We have planned a multi-season arc for these characters, and hope our audience will be along for the full ride.   Indiegogo allows campaigns that meet their funding goal to continue raising funds through their InDemand platform and that is our desired outcome for this project. 
Wait, Can You Even Do This?
We are not affiliated with Marvel Entertainment. Our project is a parody and as such, is afforded certain protections under the doctrine of Fair Use. This is a not-for-profit production; we aren't lining our shoes with the money. All funds raised, whether by crowdfunding, income from streaming services, or passing the hat (which we are NOT above) will be used for the production. 

I'm Sold! How Can I Help?
Fork over the cash, of course. But if you cannot contribute funds at this time, you can:

Share our campaign on your social media or via email,  along with a personal message from you, and like us on Facebook.
Offer an in-kind contribution of a location, props or catering (contact us to work out the details). 
Watch the series when it airs and tell everyone you know how awesome it is!",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Film</h3>
<p>Coworkers is a comedy-fantasy webseries about 5 employees who wake up dazed and confused in a desert with no memory of how they got there.  They try and retrace their steps so that they can get back home. They soon realize they are no longer on Earth and that they are dead and have portled to another dimension where they become the ""chosen ones"". </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>We plan on finishing Season 1 by 2021.  We are currently shooting episode 2 and writing episode 3.  We have a tight schedule but I have a very strong and talented cast and crew and I know we will be able to capture all the shots we need and worst case scenario I have a backup date available if we need more time.  This episode is going to shot in multiple takes instead of how the first episode was shot in one single take.  That was mainly because that was the rule for the contest I submitted the first episode to.  </p>
<p>J. R. Fortin plays the role of Liam, a hilarious yet typical stoner. Ryan Vilacci plays the role of Derrick, a hopeless romantic who is not the brightest lightbulb in the box and is head over heels for Lanna.  Lanna is a girly girl played by Elizabeth Haskell. Lila is a determined and bossy woman played by Caitlynn Mccauley.  Cody Curtis plays as the character Zane who is Liam's best friend.  Connor Hall will play them magical mystery man and Delanna Swett will play the magical mystery woman character.</p>
<p>Cody Curtis is also the producer and assistant director for Coworkers. Christopher Fyfe is the Director of Photography.  Sherry Estabrook and John Rondaeu, owners of Epic Studio in Portland, ME, will be doing sound and  behind the scenes photography and videography on our film set.  Tamiya Joseph is the 1st assistant camera and also will be helping out with photography. </p>

<h3>The Impact </h3>
<p>By donating to this cause you are helping me cover the costs of making this episode and by doing so you are helping me achieve my goal; creating Coworkers Episode #2. </p>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I am aware that shooting during the COVID-19 Pandemic is going to be a difficult challenge.  I can eliminate the risk of spreading the virus by making sure everyone sanitizes their hands frequently throughout the day and making sure everyone adheres to wearing masks and staying socially distant when possible.</p>

Risks & Challenges
I am aware that shooting during the COVID-19 Pandemic is going to be a difficult challenge.  I can eliminate the risk of spreading the virus by making sure everyone sanitizes their hands frequently throughout the day and making sure everyone adheres to wearing masks and staying socially distant when possible.

<h3>The Inspiration behind the story</h3>
<p>During the past few years Max, the writer and producer of Nariko's Voyage, has become more and more conscious of the fact that there is hardly an animal species in the world that is not impacted by humans – be that pollution of the oceans, the hunting of rare wildlife or the damage to animals and the environment caused by factory farming. He was sitting in a restaurant, on the table in front of him was a paper table mat with a drawing of three leopard seals on it. At that instant, the image of Greta sailing across the Atlantic and the leopard seals fused into one image to create the beginning of Nariko’s Voyage. Within a few days, Max created an outline and began to write the screenplay. That was in September 2019 and now one year later here he is with his colleagues, ready to shoot the teaser for what is intended to be a 30-episode TV series.</p>

<h3>Friends, webseries fans, countrymen, lend me your ears</h3>
<p>I'm Jessamyn, the head of Travelling Lemon Productions and showrunner for Twincidents. You may know me from my work as a co-creator of Project Dashwood or one for the several other literary-inspired webseries I've been privileged to work on. For Twincidents, I'm joined by an amazing team of talented young women around the world who've developed and written the story with me, and we can't wait to bring it to life. </p>
<p>To do that, we need your support! Project Dashwood was produced on virtually no budget--my two co-creators and I chipped in a few bucks here and there for props, snacks, and things like memory cards, but almost everything we used--including the camcorder we shot it on--were borrowed. For Twincidents, we'd like to up the production quality and make the story the best it can be!</p>

<p>In our genderbent update of Shakespeare's A Comedy of Errors, join adopted sisters Alex and Drew as they film their quest to find Alex’s birth family. They end up in the town of Ephesus, where drama student/vlogger Adriana’s life is going great - she’s vlogging, she has the lead in the play, and she’s in love with her girlfriend Alex. But everyone encounters more mixups, mayhem, and romance than they bargained for when it turns out the two Alexes are long-lost identical twins.<br/><br/><strong>Our Vision:</strong><br/>Our hope is that this series will bring new perspective to one of Shakespeare's less loved comedies by adding challenges facing modern day foster and adopted youth and their families--whatever that may look like. </p>
<p><strong>Our Team:</strong><br/>The creative team behind this show has worked on just about every LIW you can think of including The Misselthwaite Archives, Northbound, Away From it All, Merry Maidens, and WH Academy.

</div></div>","Friends, webseries fans, countrymen, lend me your ears
I'm Jessamyn, the head of Travelling Lemon Productions and showrunner for Twincidents. You may know me from my work as a co-creator of Project Dashwood or one for the several other literary-inspired webseries I've been privileged to work on. For Twincidents, I'm joined by an amazing team of talented young women around the world who've developed and written the story with me, and we can't wait to bring it to life. 
To do that, we need your support! Project Dashwood was produced on virtually no budget--my two co-creators and I chipped in a few bucks here and there for props, snacks, and things like memory cards, but almost everything we used--including the camcorder we shot it on--were borrowed. For Twincidents, we'd like to up the production quality and make the story the best it can be!
Since we're dealing with identical twins, we'll be filming ""Parent Trap""-style, with one actress playing two characters.  To pull off those special effects, it's important that we can have consistent lighting and good editing software.

<p><strong>What is this Production Project about?</strong></p>
<p>-We have two outstanding TV Shows that we have been in talks with various networks about possibly being a new show on their schedule in 2018. One show is a 30 minutes sitcom about three best friends, who were determined to have a career and the man of their dreams and the other show is a one-hour (mystery, thriller) drama based on the lives of four business women from four different worlds. All are graced with beauty, intelligence, passion, drive and an appeal that is undeniable to those around them.</p>
<p><strong><u>Synopsis:</u></strong></p>
<p>-First, you have the 30 minutes sitcom about three best friends growing up in the Hamptons who are known for partying, shopping, famous friends and various men. Now embracing their 30’s they believe they’re ready to settle down in their careers and search for Mr. Right. Needing an environment to support their trendy lifestyle, they decide to move Manhattan to start their careers. These “Designing Women” of the new millennium seemed to be living their dreams, fulfilling their goals, and accomplishing their aspirations. All is in place, but the one thing they all desire...’The Perfect Guy’. After all, what good is a fortune, and success without one to share it with? Yes, searching for Mr. Right could possibly be one of the most challenging if not demanding tasks our ladies have ever taken on given the lives they’ve lived. There lies our dilemma for the 3 of them, should they wait for Mr. Right? Or would they choose Mr. Right Now?</p>
<p>Next, the hour long (mystery, thriller) drama where we want everyone to take a journey through the lives of four of the most powerful and hungry women around. Discover how high the price can be to get to the top and what it takes to stay there. Who will win, who will lose, and who will be able to keep the darkness from coming to light? From the outside, it seems perfect and what every woman would want, but is it really? What drives these powerful women? Is there a darker dimension to their lives that most are not privy to see? All four of these women have secrets. Some are bigger and darker than others, but they are there. When you mix the desire to get ahead at any cost with the ability to get anything done, things can happen. Bad things can happen, or at least the types of things they never want to see the light of day. Hiding secrets often involve devious deeds, forming strange alliances, and nearly selling their souls. Each lady has perfect, powerful lives on the outside, but only because of the dark and devious moves underneath. Enemies are prone to disappear mysteriously, interested men are abundant and calling, and while good lovers are hard to come by, these ladies know that their friendship is one of the strongest assets they have. Each of them knows that their business is their heart, and they will stop at nothing to keep it beating!</p>
<p><strong>Why are these two TV Shows important?</strong></p>
<p>-The networks desperately need some fresh new shows so people can enjoy watching TV again. We are over saturated with Reality TV Shows depicting violent fights, cussing, drinking, smoking, extreme ratchet behavior, and too much sex with other women’s men.  Right now, women are not being depicted in a positive and respectful way. It is NOT a lot of good shows on TV and these two shows would help to mitigate the negative and degrading way women have been portrayed. These TV Shows would display young women trying to establish a career and other women who have been successful in their careers. Lady K Productions are looking to submit this 30 minutes sitcom about three young women who are determined to get their career popping and find a good man to settle down and get married. The hour long show will be about four successful women in business from different culture and nationality.</p>
<p><strong>Why Crowd fund this project?</strong></p>
<p>- These shows will have a very position image for all our young women who only had stripping, ratchet, sex tapes, side chick, music video vixens, and THOT’s activities to be glorified to them. Lady K Productions want to show women that having a career and being an entrepreneur is way better than what Reality TV Shows are offering women to humiliate themselves on National TV in front of millions of viewers. Let’s all demand better shows to watch on TV and we can start by helping to fund these two shows that Lady K Productions is close to getting on the TV Network lineup for 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Meet the Producers and Director</strong></p>
<p>Daphne Hayes is a writer, producer, and set decorator who was born in Newark, NJ, currently living in Lithonia, GA. She began her career in the entertainment industry in 2005 and will make her directorial debut by filming House Arrest, which she wrote. Daphne has been a part of some notable projects like Vampire Diaries, The Blind Side, Million Dollar Arm, and The Game, just to name a few. She is very enthusiastic about working with Lady K Productions as the producer of the hour long (mystery, thriller) drama TV Show about four POWERFUL Business Women.</p>
<p>Warren Pemberton is an active filmmaker and director who was born in New London, Connective, but now resides in Lawrenceville, GA. His first independent film Ear Wax displayed his idea that all dreams are worth fighting for and in his sophomore debut, Criminal Behavior, he explores the notion that you can never truly escape your past. He just completed his third independent film, The OtherSide which will be a big hit in 2018. After learning about this newly formed group of talented women in the TV/Film Industry, Warren has decided to join forces with Lady K Productions and this amazing upcoming Script Writer to direct an hour long (mystery, thriller) drama TV Show about four SHREWED Business Women.</p>

<p>The things that happen to us at a young age stick with us, whether we like it or not. Milo, a 12-year-old boy growing up in a small town, has a more challenging set of circumstances than most - he has a stalker. In the summer of 1999, Milo's peaceful upbringing comes to a screeching halt when a series of disturbing and inexplicable events begin to dominate his life. As the threat builds, Milo stumbles into a mystery involving the people around him and what they are trying to hide. </p>
<p>Years later, Milo, now 27-years-old, discovers a collection of unsettling videotapes he believes to be connected to his childhood, leading him on a mission to discover what was hidden from him for so many years.</p>
<p>This is a story about the secrets that people sometimes bury, and what happens when they finally come to light.</p>

Director Aidan Weaver and co-writer Chris Stephens have been developing Clouds since September of 2016, and after a year of revisions, production meetings, late nights, and countless cups of coffee,  we are finally ready to bring the 174 pages to life. 
But Here's the Catch 
While certain expenses are covered, we still need to raise an additional $5,000 to cover our final expenses. 
Below, you will find out why. 

When you're a kid, sometimes you feel alone. Sometimes you feel scared. And, sometimes, you should.
The things that happen to us at a young age stick with us, whether we like it or not. Milo, a 12-year-old boy growing up in a small town, has a more challenging set of circumstances than most - he has a stalker. In the summer of 1999, Milo's peaceful upbringing comes to a screeching halt when a series of disturbing and inexplicable events begin to dominate his life. As the threat builds, Milo stumbles into a mystery involving the people around him and what they are trying to hide. 
Years later, Milo, now 27-years-old, discovers a collection of unsettling videotapes he believes to be connected to his childhood, leading him on a mission to discover what was hidden from him for so many years.
This is a story about the secrets that people sometimes bury, and what happens when they finally come to light.

 Let's Break it Down

Clouds is a 30-day production to be filmed entirely in Asheville, North Carolina,
The production begins on July 3rd and ends on August 11th, and
Our 20 person crew has worked together on multiple short films, allowing us to work quickly and efficiently to immortalize this project on film in less than a month's time.

Why We Need a Little Extra Help
Locations | Props | Music Licensing

From dingy dive bars to small-town elementary schools, we've scoured practically all of Asheville, North Carolina to create the world of Clouds. Some of our best locations were completely free, but others require a small fee, and that fee is well worth it in the end production.
Clouds is a partial period piece set in 1999, forcing us to source props ranging from VHS cameras to bulky televisions to cassette tape players. 
To accent the world we're building, we need to license a few key pieces of music truly convey the right tone.

This is Where You Come In
Any contribution will have a direct effect on the screen. Below is a breakdown of our budget, so you can see where you will be helping us out!

<p><i>BLISS, is going to be a made for television comedy sitcom.  The sitcom focuses on the fictitious BLISS Wedding Chapel  and its employees here in Las Vegas.  From the bride who married a mannequin, to the swinger couple who wanted me to continue my “service” in their hotel room… it has been one unusual wedding after the other.  Each episode focuses on those crazy weddings that Las Vegas is known for.  There will be many surprises! Chapel employees are not immune to the quirky, unusual and downright craziness that happens.  We will have an up close and personal looks into the lives and dealings  of the  chapel staff.</i></p>
<p><i>BLISS will be a faced paced comedy, with plenty of all that comedy has to offer, witty banter, physical comedy, one liners, and total absurd situations.</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<p>Our target campaign goal for BLISS is $60,000. The focus is on the talent, because a successful comedy requires spot-on acting performances, physical and facial expressiveness, and comedic timing.</p>
<p>Using the format of such successful sitcoms as Friends, Big Bang Theory, Always Sunny in Philadelphia, they started with a somewhat unknown cast, and turned it into something big.  We feel we’ve assembled a cast that has that comedic “it” that will make this show a success. The BLISS ensemble members are some of the brightest and funniest talents! We truly believe that and want them to shine through this sitcom.</p>
<p>The success of a comedy lies, not only with its actors, but will the cameras ability to capture the right moment, and the ability of the video editor to make the perfect shot cuts.  For this reason, a majority of the budget goes to the camera/editing.  We are shooting a single camera situational comedy and with this fund raiser are looking to use cameras suggested by Netflix, as well as the networks.  Our goal is to have 2 cameras rolling to catch those actors in the moment.  In a nutshell, whatever is raised with this campaign, it will go to the actors, camera and editing teams, and an upgrade in cameras.</p>
<p>We feel that with your help and with the fun and exciting perks we have to offer that we can achieve out 60,000 goal. </p>
<p>We have offered many different tiers of perks, and hope that you can contribute what you can and make this project come to life the way it deserves.  If you love the idea behind this project and would like to see it made, please share our campaign.</p>

<p>Sitcoms are and will always be a breath of fresh air.  Making one laugh is our gift to others. ""A day without laughter is a day wasted"". Charlie Chaplin.  ""You don't stop laughing because you grow old. You grow old because you stop laughing."" Michael Pritchard.</p>

<p>This project is near and dear to my heart, as it is 14 years in the making.  14 years of meeting and associating with some of the most wonderful and astonishing people, not only whom I've married but whom I've worked with.  It has been fulfilling and rewarding.  And like relationships there have been a lot of roller coaster rides in this journey(sorry, the minister in me likes to use analogies).

</div></div>","BLISS, is going to be a made for television comedy sitcom.  The sitcom focuses on the fictitious BLISS Wedding Chapel  and its employees here in Las Vegas.  From the bride who married a mannequin, to the swinger couple who wanted me to continue my “service” in their hotel room… it has been one unusual wedding after the other.  Each episode focuses on those crazy weddings that Las Vegas is known for.  There will be many surprises! Chapel employees are not immune to the quirky, unusual and downright craziness that happens.  We will have an up close and personal looks into the lives and dealings  of the  chapel staff.
BLISS will be a faced paced comedy, with plenty of all that comedy has to offer, witty banter, physical comedy, one liners, and total absurd situations.

 
Our target campaign goal for BLISS is $60,000. The focus is on the talent, because a successful comedy requires spot-on acting performances, physical and facial expressiveness, and comedic timing.
Using the format of such successful sitcoms as Friends, Big Bang Theory, Always Sunny in Philadelphia, they started with a somewhat unknown cast, and turned it into something big.  We feel we’ve assembled a cast that has that comedic “it” that will make this show a success. The BLISS ensemble members are some of the brightest and funniest talents! We truly believe that and want them to shine through this sitcom.
The success of a comedy lies, not only with its actors, but will the cameras ability to capture the right moment, and the ability of the video editor to make the perfect shot cuts.  For this reason, a majority of the budget goes to the camera/editing.  We are shooting a single camera situational comedy and with this fund raiser are looking to use cameras suggested by Netflix, as well as the networks.  Our goal is to have 2 cameras rolling to catch those actors in the moment.  In a nutshell, whatever is raised with this campaign, it will go to the actors, camera and editing teams, and an upgrade in cameras.
We feel that with your help and with the fun and exciting perks we have to offer that we can achieve out 60,000 goal. 
We have offered many different tiers of perks, and hope that you can contribute what you can and make this project come to life the way it deserves.  If you love the idea behind this project and would like to see it made, please share our campaign.

Sitcoms are and will always be a breath of fresh air.  Making one laugh is our gift to others. ""A day without laughter is a day wasted"". Charlie Chaplin.  ""You don't stop laughing because you grow old. You grow old because you stop laughing."" Michael Pritchard.
 

This project is near and dear to my heart, as it is 14 years in the making.  14 years of meeting and associating with some of the most wonderful and astonishing people, not only whom I've married but whom I've worked with.  It has been fulfilling and rewarding.  And like relationships there have been a lot of roller coaster rides in this journey(sorry, the minister in me likes to use analogies). We've wanted to make this happen for so long, but we realized that we couldn't do it half a#@ed. The timing and the funds needed to be in order. This was a lot more work and money than we imagined, but we've loved every step of this journey. We are so close now, and we truly believe that this project deserves to be seen by all.  We  need your help in knocking this out of the park.  Thank you in advance for your help and support.  Please, if you can't contribute, we would love for you to get the word out to as many of your family and friends as possible.

<h3>The Inspiration For <i>z'lectrik</i>
</h3>
<p><i>z'lectrik </i>[pronounced: zuh-<strong>lek</strong>-trik] originated from the mind of Steven Lopez. He drew inspirations from <i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Blade Runner</a>, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113568/?ref_=nv_sr_3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ghost in the Shell (1995)</a>, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/?ref_=nv_sr_1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Inception</a>, </i>and <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2085059/?ref_=nv_sr_1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Black Mirror</i></a>  to help fully create the concept of artificial memories and the corporate-run retro-future of Zenith City. Not only will the series be a tip of the hat to 80's science fiction films, it will go in-depth about the premature growth to a technological advancement too big to fully comprehend and its sociological impact.</p>
<p>The series follows a woman with an infected mind as she goes for outside help, looking to discover the meaning behind the voices in her head. However, as events unfold, she will delve into a world much larger than herself...</p>

His specialty may be at the camera department, but he can also stand on his own in other fields as an editor, director, and writer of films. Vimeo • Cinematography Reel • IMDb • Instagram Brittany Zwier is a producer, production manager, and assistant director based in Northeast  NJ. She has produced and organized a number of successful and imaginative short films in her career including, but not limited to Breeding Grounds: The Web Series, A Table Discussion and The Vessel. Brittany is passionate about assisting others with the realization of their creative works and is enthusiastic about embarking on the journey that will be z'lectrik. As much as he loves creating and designing sets, Burak Aydogan always had a soft spot working with small scaled models and figures, and making them look as realistic as possible in front of a camera.  He skills in miniatures and set design were put to the test in several films, including when he directed A Table Discussion  - a business comedy set in the 60's, and other shorts like The Vessel  -  a sci-fi film set in the 80's. z'lectrik will prove to be his next greatest feat, and he is looking forward to the challenge!IMDb • Instagram Chris Giuseppini has produced many of Montclair State’s most successful crowdfunding campaigns (including the sci-fi short, The Vessel ) and is excited to be a part of z'lectrik. He was the Director of Photography when shooting the films trailer, and is passionate about delivering an incredible product with the film.Chris is in his junior year at Montclair State University and has directed two narrative films, a documentary and the first commercial to be produced by the university.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Creator Richard Sirgiovanni’s interest and career always ran on parallel roads as a cartoonist and musician at an early age. By day he worked as a cartoonist on hundreds of diverse projects, and by night as a drummer in several rock bands for live performances and studio recordings. His interest always was cartooning and music… Ergo… “Birth of The Grimps”. Richard's dream has always been to create a program for kids that every family, including his own, would love together. </p>
<p>The team is made up of music-industry experts who have spent decades of their career bringing iconic music to millions. Toni Bongiovi and Ron Alexenburg joined Richard Sirgiovanni to bring this project to life. </p>
<p>The campaign will enable us to bring The Grimps to the next step of getting a television development deal and launching this project. Although the music is in place with producer Tony Bongiovi, his studio and our live boys band (The Grimps) the animated series needs a distribution deal to launch this project.</p>
<p>It is no longer the norm that networks will buy and develop a show even with a good idea on paper. They need to see a short film that will represent the ongoing series. The Grimps is a unique entertainment property and now an animated short needs to be made. Your contributions are key to helping us make the film.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Animation is expensive and cost varies dramatically depending on the type of animation needed and could range from $10K to $30K per minute. We are looking to raise $30K to produce a 6 minute 2D animated short. To give you some examples of 2D animation we would have to compare it to The Simpsons, Dora The Explorer, or other family favorites.</span></p>
<p>The $30K cost to complete this animated short consists of many elements and talent within the animation studio. Storyboards, background design, character design, effects, voiceover talent, sound effects, music, audio mix, and edit.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our full goal we will still make the most of your generous contributions and produce a shorter video within the budget that will be prepared for a studio review. </p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul></ul>
<p>Although there are a lot of great kids shows out there, there are also a lot of shows that are irreverent and do not send good messages to kids. The intention of The Grimps is to produce a series that is fun, entertaining and sends positive messages to our youth. A show that kids can watch with their parents and grandparents. Your contributions would enable us to make this animated short which will be a tool to present to TV networks for a development deal. We believe that The Grimps TV series will make a positive impact on kids in many ways.</p>
<p>The Grimps musical partners, Tony Bongiovi and Ron Alexenburg have been involved and responsible for some of the most successful hit songs and albums in rock history. Michael Jackson, Bon Jovi, Meatloaf, Aerosmith, Bruce Springsteen, The Ramones, and The Beach Boys to name a few.</p>
<p><br/>Our intention &amp; goal is to make The Grimps a relevant rock n roll band presented animated in the TV series and then to tour live on stage with our boy band (The Grimps) with hit songs to a new generation.</p>
<p>The creator and partners of The Grimps have many years of experience in the entertainment and music business. Our confidence in the content of this idea and the success stories in the music business, drives us knowing we can find a home for The Grimps on TV once this short film is made.</p>

<p>Thousands of people have already watched season one and, for season two, we plan to delve even deeper into Adam's struggles as he seeks to reinvent himself while remaining relevant at an age where it's easy to feel like you've disappeared.   This season, we'll also learn more about Adam's wife Abby (played by Nikki Cozart) and her frustrations as she tight rope walks marriage and career.  With her husband travelling back and forth to New York to pursue his acting dreams, she's the one bringing home the bulk of the earnings while working in a field that's draining her spirit. Meanwhile, Petra Antonelli (Sasha Carrera) deals with sobriety and works to rebuild her relationship with her daughter and resume her acting career. .   As in season one, the city of Baltimore remains an integral character in the show and, because of the success of the first season, locations have been offered to us that will further highlight the city and its rapidly growing arts scene. </p>

<p>If you've had the opportunity to watch season one then we hope you're hooked on the series and dying to see more.  If so, this is how we do it.  While we would love a major studio like Amazon or Netflix to finance the show, the realities of the industry make that possibility a real long shot.  Rather than wait, we just want to get the work done ourselves and tell the story we're dying to tell. We hope that after you watch the trailer you'll see that the stuff we've shot so far  for season two is pretty darn incredible.   Some of the most highly regarded crew in the region have offered us their time and equipment at a fraction of their normal rate and, of course, the cast is spectacular and everyone works hard because we're all in love with the characters and thrilled by the response from our growing audience.   We plan to deliver another 8 episode season that's extremely funny, poignant and keeps you wanting to watch more.  It's Baltimore's own BINGE show and we hope you can help us make it happen.  </p>

<p>Every dollar we receive goes directly into the production and, to complete all eight episodes, we're looking at about a 30 day shoot.  So to get to the finish line, we expect to spend around $1000 a day- twice last year's daily budget. Because of our growing reputation as a quality show with high production values,  experienced crew have offered their services at a greatly reduced rate.  Still, they have to make something, right?  Working on a film crew is tough.  A lot of lifting, a lot of sweating and a lot of planning.   The $30,000 we're looking for will allow us to dramatically up our production game and give us access to a much higher quality camera (Canon C300 mkii for you gear heads) than anything we used last season, Zeiss prime lenses, improved sound equipment (we'll actually have TWO lavaliers! Maybe more... yay!) and a state of the art monitor so we can actually see what's happening in front of the camera.  Pretty exciting.</p>
<p>Without the seriously ""thank you so much, guys"" financial break we've been offered by cast, crew and equipment rental company, this number could easily be around A HUNDRED GRAND. So to be able to deliver what we plan to for $30,000 is amazing and will go a long way towards showing the world that truly great tv shows and films can originate and be produced in smaller markets like Baltimore, DC and Virginia.  We didn't want to bore you with some arbitrary pie chart thing but here's EXACTLY where your contribution will go:</p>
<p>EQUIPMENT RENTAL.... This will likely cost us around $375 a day for camera, lenses and monitor (a crazy good bargain considering what we're getting) but we may occasionally want something a bit more exotic for a cool crane shot or a special light.</p>
<p>CREW PAYROLL...  Right now it looks like our crew is working for a total of around $350-450 a day... again, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK  YOU.</p>
<p>FOOD...  We don't have the budget for a craft services spread  complete with omelette station but bagels and coffee in the morning and some decent sandwiches or salads for lunch are what we shoot for.  Oh, and lots of water and snacks throughout the day.  About $150 or so a day should do it.</p>
<p>MISCELLANEOUS- Hard to say... could be an actor travelling up from New York or, who knows? Tennessee, maybe?  Or props we need to buy or maybe a location we can't get for free.  Hard to budget for this but we'll definitely need some extra at some point.</p>
<p>So, as you can see,  trying to make this for $1000 a day is going to be tough but if we can get to $30,000+  we know we'll have the resources to get the show finished and released. AND EVERY DOLLAR HELPS!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Abraham Stern and Raquel Serebrenik are two Colombians who met at the Savannah College of Art and Design in 2012. It struck a nerve on them when they discussed how little exposure there is for artists and cultural initiatives, yet, they play a strong part in the economy of most countries: inspiring innovation and driving tourism.</p>
<p><strong>'Revival Cities: The Series' is a platform for game-changing artists and cultural initiatives</strong> <strong>in emerging art-cities</strong>, contributing to the growth and rebirth of these metropolis. Our goal is to show why these places matter,<strong> </strong>and how all the new developing business opportunities available, are <strong>helping entire communities reach their full potential.</strong></p>
<p>For our first season, we will travel to Bogota, Melbourne, Seoul, Mumbai and Johannesburg to discover the people and places at the center of the cultural boom in these areas.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>To make it a reality we will need:</h3>
<p>This is an ambitious project, with the goal to reach USD$120,000, We are looking to create the highest quality production possible, with the best resources available to give these Revival Cities, the platform they deserve.</p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of the resources distribution:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518976480/iffwyp1w7ckswdkzybih.png"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<u><i>Equipment rental:</i></u>  Two cameras, two microphones, lighting for inside and outside as well as memory space.</li>
<li>
<u><i>Travel expenses for a team of 4:</i></u> flights, accommodations, insurance, transportation, food.</li>
<li>
<u><i>Production team salaries</i></u>: Four staff members including a producer, a director, a camera operator, a sound person (and a translator when needed).</li>
<li>
<u><i>Post- production:</i></u> Editing, sound design, motion graphics, and translation if needed.</li>
<li>
<u><i>Marketing and advertising:</i></u> distribution, branding and promotion.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are conscious that your kind contribution without benefits wouldn't be as fun. This is why <strong>we have created special perks to make this project meaningful for you, our supporter! </strong>From being <i>credited in every episode</i>, to <i>owning a copy of 'The Series'</i> and it's soundtrack, and having the chance to attend the special events Revival Cities organizes all over the world, and <i>attending the big premiere</i>. Get ready!</p>
<p>In case this campaign doesn't reach it's entire goal, we will work our best to adapt the series to the resources available, we believe this project is worth the hard work, and that it will have a powerful effect on thousands of cultural entrepreneurs and citizens all over the world.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>'The Series' is the starting point for Revival Cities. Our long term vision is to <strong>transform the world into a place where real growth opportunity can be found anywhere.</strong> From our personal experience, like many other young professionals, we grew the need to move to New York City. However, as we realized the immense potential Revival Cities have, we couldn’t help but wonder all the opportunities available that we were missing out on.</p>
<p><strong>We want the “New York” effect to be available in more areas of the world</strong> and see how the uniqueness of each emerging art-capital can lead us into a better future.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Like any dream, challenges are part of the journey. Nevertheless, we are ready to face them and learn from them. A few of the concerns that might arise are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<u><i>We didn’t achieve the budget goal:</i></u> If this is the case, we will continue to fundraise and adjust to the available budget the best way possible.</li>
<li>
<u><i>‘The Series’ doesn’t get picked up by a streaming service:</i></u> We will use YouTube or YouTube Red as an alternative to showcase the production as well as participate on film and television festivals.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Money plays a big part on creating 'Revival Cities: The Series', but it is not the only way to support the project, this is what you can do:</p>

Abraham Stern and Raquel Serebrenik are two Colombians who met at the Savannah College of Art and Design in 2012. It struck a nerve on them when they discussed how little exposure there is for artists and cultural initiatives, yet, they play a strong part in the economy of most countries: inspiring innovation and driving tourism.
'Revival Cities: The Series' is a platform for game-changing artists and cultural initiatives in emerging art-cities, contributing to the growth and rebirth of these metropolis. Our goal is to show why these places matter, and how all the new developing business opportunities available, are helping entire communities reach their full potential.
For our first season, we will travel to Bogota, Melbourne, Seoul, Mumbai and Johannesburg to discover the people and places at the center of the cultural boom in these areas.

To make it a reality we will need:
This is an ambitious project, with the goal to reach USD$120,000, We are looking to create the highest quality production possible, with the best resources available to give these Revival Cities, the platform they deserve.
Here is a breakdown of the resources distribution:



Equipment rental:  Two cameras, two microphones, lighting for inside and outside as well as memory space.

Travel expenses for a team of 4: flights, accommodations, insurance, transportation, food.

Production team salaries: Four staff members including a producer, a director, a camera operator, a sound person (and a translator when needed).

Post- production: Editing, sound design, motion graphics, and translation if needed.

Marketing and advertising: distribution, branding and promotion.

We are conscious that your kind contribution without benefits wouldn't be as fun. This is why we have created special perks to make this project meaningful for you, our supporter! From being credited in every episode, to owning a copy of 'The Series' and it's soundtrack, and having the chance to attend the special events Revival Cities organizes all over the world, and attending the big premiere. Get ready!
In case this campaign doesn't reach it's entire goal, we will work our best to adapt the series to the resources available, we believe this project is worth the hard work, and that it will have a powerful effect on thousands of cultural entrepreneurs and citizens all over the world.
 

The Impact
'The Series' is the starting point for Revival Cities. Our long term vision is to transform the world into a place where real growth opportunity can be found anywhere. From our personal experience, like many other young professionals, we grew the need to move to New York City. However, as we realized the immense potential Revival Cities have, we couldn’t help but wonder all the opportunities available that we were missing out on.
We want the “New York” effect to be available in more areas of the world and see how the uniqueness of each emerging art-capital can lead us into a better future.
 

Risks & Challenges
Like any dream, challenges are part of the journey. Nevertheless, we are ready to face them and learn from them. A few of the concerns that might arise are:


We didn’t achieve the budget goal: If this is the case, we will continue to fundraise and adjust to the available budget the best way possible.

‘The Series’ doesn’t get picked up by a streaming service: We will use YouTube or YouTube Red as an alternative to showcase the production as well as participate on film and television festivals.

Money plays a big part on creating 'Revival Cities: The Series', but it is not the only way to support the project, this is what you can do:

<i>SoCal Wanderer</i> takes you to Southern California’s hidden gems and wonders, exploring the rich history, culture and landscape of the region</h2>
<p>Over the last five years, we’ve taken you off the beaten path with fun and insightful guides and videos, revealing the true essence of our region in ways that can’t be captured in a traditional guidebook. We’ve explored everything from Joshua Tree’s lesser-known hikes to Downtown LA’s most historic hotels.</p>
<div><h2>With your support, <i>SoCal Wanderer</i> will produce a digital episode and interactive guide that showcases the hidden beauty of the LA River</h2></div>

<p>New York has the High Line. San Antonio has its River Walk. Every major city has found a way to reclaim a forgotten urban space, turning it into a welcome paradise for its residents. Now, Los Angeles is on its way to doing the same, transforming its signature waterway, the Los Angeles River, into a 51-mile continuous waterway that would connect the neighborhoods of Los Angeles from the San Fernando Valley all the way to Long Beach.</p>

<p>Rosey visits a local restaurant and gets to take a look behind the counter. We meet with a local artist to learn about the rich arts culture along the river.</p>
<p>Finally we tour the river’s bridges, old and new, and learn from a city planner about their preservation and future.</p>

<h2>About Rosey Alvero</h2>
<p>Rosey is always the curious adventurer up for any quest and seeks to learn from and empower those she meets on her travels.

She is a co-founder of Cache Cache, a female-driven culinary and moving image centered experiential concept, a result of her belief that food and travel can bring people together. Over the past decade, she has taken her skills to professional kitchens across the globe with extended stays in New York, Paris, Brussels, Manila, and San Francisco.

<li>Exacerbation of the Black maternal health and mortality crisis; </li>

<li>Racist aggression faced by Asian Americans;</li>
<li>Toll on gig economy workers with little access to unemployment benefits, health insurance, and paid sick leave.</li>
<li>As a documentary-style video producer, I’m granted the opportunity to learn first-hand from people who aren’t afforded the same privilege as I am and are generous enough to share their lived experience with not just me, but the world. I feel passionately about my craft because it enables me to honor the perspectives I seek to elevate in the most honest and clear manner possible.

<li>Production technique will make use of zoom lenses, boom mics, and gear that enables as much social distance as possible;</li>
<li>Masks and gloves will be utilized by producers and crew 100% — no exceptions;</li>
<li>Where subjects are being filmed without a mask, a plexiglass barrier will act as a physical shield between producer and subject;</li>

</ul><p> </p><p><strong>ABOUT THE PRODUCER.</strong></p><p>Hi, Kat here. I’m a video producer who gives a damn about our country and making it a better place for all, for generations to come. I’ve spent the majority of my career in politics helping to amplify the work of leaders and organizations full of big brains and big hearts who sincerely care about people — Beto O'Rourke’s presidential campaign, the Democratic National Committee, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and the Democratic Caucus among others. A few years ago I followed my love of storytelling and opened my own video shop. I’ve always hated those candidate commercials with scripted lines, cheesy backdrops, and fake actors … which is why I’ve worked to defy the traditional look and feel of campaign ads — utilizing documentary storytelling to capture the lives of real people where they live, work, and pray with the intent to inform, inspire empathy, and provoke a drive to fight for change. </p><p>And now? With your help, I intend to tackle this new project with everything I’ve got. My ultimate intent is to raise awareness of the issues that are causing deep harm to many of our fellow Americans and to inspire real and meaningful change for those who’ve been hardest hit. </p><p>So, please donate if you can and — this is important — share this IndieGoGo campaign with all of your friends and family on social media.

I feel passionately about my craft because it enables me to honor the perspectives I seek to elevate in the most honest and clear manner possible. My ultimate intent is to raise awareness of the issues that are causing deep harm to many of our fellow Americans and to inspire real and meaningful change for those who’ve been hardest hit. 
 SAFETY PRECAUTIONS. Production will adhere to a strict set of guidelines designed to ensure the safety of video producers, crew, and subjects:
Travel will be limited to sites that can be reached by car to avoid planes and other forms of transportation that increase exposure to a greater number of humans;
Production technique will make use of zoom lenses, boom mics, and gear that enables as much social distance as possible;
Masks and gloves will be utilized by producers and crew 100% — no exceptions;
Where subjects are being filmed without a mask, a plexiglass barrier will act as a physical shield between producer and subject;
Barbicide, which is EPA approved for efficacy against COVID-19 will be applied to all production tools before and after shooting. 
 ABOUT THE PRODUCER.Hi, Kat here. I’m a video producer who gives a damn about our country and making it a better place for all, for generations to come. I’ve spent the majority of my career in politics helping to amplify the work of leaders and organizations full of big brains and big hearts who sincerely care about people — Beto O'Rourke’s presidential campaign, the Democratic National Committee, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and the Democratic Caucus among others. A few years ago I followed my love of storytelling and opened my own video shop. I’ve always hated those candidate commercials with scripted lines, cheesy backdrops, and fake actors … which is why I’ve worked to defy the traditional look and feel of campaign ads — utilizing documentary storytelling to capture the lives of real people where they live, work, and pray with the intent to inform, inspire empathy, and provoke a drive to fight for change. And now? With your help, I intend to tackle this new project with everything I’ve got. My ultimate intent is to raise awareness of the issues that are causing deep harm to many of our fellow Americans and to inspire real and meaningful change for those who’ve been hardest hit. So, please donate if you can and — this is important — share this IndieGoGo campaign with all of your friends and family on social media. I can’t do this without you and am beyond grateful for your support.  Kat Skiles, CEO & Producer, Narrative Creative Agency:

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Craig McFarlane and I'm someone who likes to go outside their comfort zone. I didn't just want to be all talk either, I wanted to show people and encourage them to try something new. So for ""Craig Tries"", I am getting the opportunity to experience lifelong dreams of playing drums and learning magic, to see how I would do as a boxer and as a model. I'll be baking and eating things I've never tried before. </p>
<h3>Is There A Pilot?</h3>
<p>Yes we've released the first episode already so you have an idea of what we're doing:</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>It costs money to try things and to have someone there to film it. That's why we need your assistance in helping cover the costs of the fantastic director, Brandon Wilson, as he films and edits it all. We also need the help with advertisement and certain experiences. As it's a documentary series, we don't have much to offer prop wise or set, but we've come up with a few fun perks. These include socks from Calgary based company, Plainsbreaker Apparel, as well as hoodies. And just for contributing, we will be giving you lots of love on our social media!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Why this series? Why now? Well ""Craig Tries"" is something I've had in my back pocket for a few years. I lost my mom to cancer when I was 10 and she was 40. Now turning 30 this past year in the middle of a pandemic, I was reminded how quickly our lives can go by. I wanted to do all those things I've always wanted to try, such as boxing or an insane burger challenge. I may not be good or able to complete it, but I'm going to try! This was my chance to go outside my comfort zone and let others see how easy it can be to try something new. Not only that, ""Craig Tries"" gives businesses and performers a chance to showcase their work and how we can go about doing things in a safe way.</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>This has been a tough year. I get it. Maybe it doesn't make sense for you to donate to a web series where a guy can make a fool of himself. So other ways you can help is SHARE, SHARE, SHARE! Let your friends and family know about ""Craig Tries"" and maybe somebody can contribute. Watch our pilot ""Craig Tries: Drumming"". And of course, share with Cher. She would love this show and I'm sure she'd like to contribute.</p>

<h3>Pro Wrestling's Paradigm Shift</h3>
<p>Since 2017, Paradigm Pro Wrestling has produced professional wrestling content that focuses on a variety of different styles and showcases a talented and diverse roster. The COVID-19 pandemic has made it difficult to impossible to produce shows with fans in attendance, so we are shifting to episodic content filmed in an empty arena in order to keep our talent working. </p>
<ul>
<li>Paradigm Pro Wrestling is a truly independent operation with no outside funding. 95% of our revenue is traditionally generated through ticket sales, so we're exploring alternative methods of raising funds in order to keep our our roster working. </li>
<li>All episodes filmed will be aired on IndependentWrestling.TV - we are creating additional content for our ""No Hook"" and ""UWFi Contenders"" series of programming. </li>
<li>All proceeds generated from this campaign will go towards the locker room, helping talented wrestlers generate income during a time which their work has largely dried up.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are looking to raise $2,000 to $5,000 to fund these tapings. All proceeds generated will go towards paying our locker-room a fair rate for their time and efforts.</li>
<li>Our management staff is volunteering their time for these tapings, and Paradigm Pro is covering all other overhead expenses such as production and venue rental fees. </li>
<li>We will be filming new episodes of ""PPW No Hook"" - an experimental blend of hip-hop culture and professional wrestling that pushes the boundaries of how pro wrestling is presented.</li>
<li>We will be filming new episodes of ""PPW UWFi Rules Contenders"" - a unique sports-centric format that highlights Japanese-inspired shoot-style professional wrestling.</li>
<li>In return for your contributions, we can offer a unique and exciting set of ""Perks"" including exclusive content, credits in the show, tickets to future events (when we can have fans agains), sponsorships, and more. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Here's how your contribution will help us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allows us to provide income to a workforce that has been hurt by the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
<li>Allows us to spotlight a diverse roster - including minority and LGBTQ wrestlers who have often been unfairly overlooked by mainstream professional wrestling. </li>
<li>Allows us to continue innovating and create new professional wrestling content.  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<p>If the FilipiNow brand of content becomes a staple in Filipino homes all over the world, parents need not worry anymore about their children losing their Filipino identity.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risk is more on the idea that if we don't pursue this advocacy, today's children that are born and raised away from the Philippines, and the ones quarantined indefinitely in their homes, will develop identities according to the content they consume.</p>
<p>How to sustain the quality of the content produced in connection to the demand to make every content relevant to every Filipino anywhere in the world will be the biggest challenge once this advocacy has started.</p>

The Impact
If the FilipiNow brand of content becomes a staple in Filipino homes all over the world, parents need not worry anymore about their children losing their Filipino identity.

Risks & Challenges
The risk is more on the idea that if we don't pursue this advocacy, today's children that are born and raised away from the Philippines, and the ones quarantined indefinitely in their homes, will develop identities according to the content they consume.
How to sustain the quality of the content produced in connection to the demand to make every content relevant to every Filipino anywhere in the world will be the biggest challenge once this advocacy has started.",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

In the context of limitless combat with no rules of engagement it combines rugby, american &amp; australian football, verbal taunting and warlike strategy. But my intrigue with this sport, culture and tradition goes further than just the tournament. It extends to the individuals that partake in it on a yearly basis and how they deal with everything that surrounds them and their world. </p><p>This documentary web series is the tool that I’ve chosen to explore the realities behind all this over the course of six months and answer further questions like these: </p><ul>
<li>Do they feel fear before entering the arena and how do they deal with it? </li>
<li>Are they slaves to violence or national heroes?</li>
<li>How has this birthright shaped these mens world’s in the present day?</li>
</ul><p>I’ve always believed there are two sides to every story. Nothing is purely black or white. We’ve seen so much on this sport’s brutality, action and glorified battles.

<li>Accessing certain players of each team and represent each of their points of view and processes throughout the period.</li>
<li>Accessing certain players and each team’s training camps and understanding what they do to prepare for the battle. </li>
<li>Covering the full spectrum of the sport, its culture, and the individuals, which represent the teams and support the players.</li>
</ul><p>The challenge in doing this is that the rivalry between the teams can be fierce and to capture this type of content as outsiders without damaging relations is a delicate balance between us, the players and the association.</p><p>So unfortunately, because of this I’ll only be able to give a concrete shooting plan and episodes schedule closer to shooting.</p><p>But luckily this is where our digital marketer will come in, keeping all our viewers informed and up to date while we shoot! Woohoo!</p><p>Eventually, after an exciting journey with these guys in their preparations and life challenges what could be better than to view the ""Calcio Fiorentino 2019"" game LIVE?</p><p>Yes folks.</p><p>That will be our grand finale and brought straight to you!  </p><div>

<p>After the game, depending on our funding results, I’d like to screen some episodes of what happens after final and season are over. The more support from you, the more we can show you! </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>FUNDING &amp; REWARDS:</strong></h3>
<p>Keeping in mind that this project aims to be operated over the course of six months on a semi ""LIVE"" basis, the budget will cover the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Hiring of the crew: cinematographer / editor / sound technician / digital marketer.</li>
<li>Shooting equipment and consumables.</li>
<li>Fees to shoot the players.</li>
<li>A fee to shoot the main tournament in June paid to the association. </li>
<li>Accommodation &amp; travel expenses.</li>
<li>Daily production &amp; general expenses. </li>
<li>Marketing and distribution expenses.</li>
<li>Musical rights. </li>
<li>Insurance.</li>
</ul>
<p>This first phase of funding allows the production to commence and complete the production half way. The next phase's goal will cover the remainder of the show as well as the finale. There is always the risk that the campaign won't hit it's goal. Should this happen I will evaluate what can be created with the funds raised and if that would be something engaging and of high quality. Alternatively if that's not possible, I will hold onto the funds, evaluate what can be improved and launch another campaign till I hit the target. </p>
<p>As a financial participant in the show, I have provided a list of rewards, structured in a way to guarantee delivery even in the event of the worst unexpected scenarios as a gesture of gratitude for your participation! These rewards are of high value based on the exclusive access that will be gained through this show to a culture not always open to the public. </p>
<p>Does this sound exciting or what??!</p>

Just how deep in heritage and tradition does this culture extend for these men, families and citizens to repeat this each year?
What are their roles in society and what is Florence’s perception of them?
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: As a culture curious Film Maker, I’m intrigued by certain individuals, in particular with people who master a physical art form by dedicating immense time, effort and passion towards it.Calcio Storico Fiorentino is a physical art form like no other. In the context of limitless combat with no rules of engagement it combines rugby, american & australian football, verbal taunting and warlike strategy. But my intrigue with this sport, culture and tradition goes further than just the tournament. It extends to the individuals that partake in it on a yearly basis and how they deal with everything that surrounds them and their world. This documentary web series is the tool that I’ve chosen to explore the realities behind all this over the course of six months and answer further questions like these: 
Do they feel fear before entering the arena and how do they deal with it? 
Are they slaves to violence or national heroes?
How has this birthright shaped these mens world’s in the present day?
I’ve always believed there are two sides to every story. Nothing is purely black or white. We’ve seen so much on this sport’s brutality, action and glorified battles. Now, I’m going to take you on a journey to the other side.            The project will be named: The Bravest of Florence, and the souls behind the armour and will be distributed through the independent online platform:-The View Spot-Yes folks.You won’t have to wait months for it to be released in an unknown cinema only to find it on DVD another 3 years later.It will be online.You will be notified.And it will be beautiful.HOW WILL THIS BE ACHIEVED? I have provisionally arranged the core team but with your help I will be able to confirm it and it will consist of me, (as Producer/Director), a Cinematographer and Assistant, an Editor, a Sound Technician and a Digital marketer.  We’re going to make sure you’re notified, hyped up and that it’s easy for you to watch while on the go, during your lunch break or after a long day while winding down on the couch.Calcio Storico Fiorentino fever starts off with a preliminary game in February 2019 to kick things off and ends with the final match on the 24th June 2019 as in the schedule below. Throughout this period we are going to shoot and release episodes on a monthly basis from Florence, Italy. The team, schedule, workflow and budget has been structured to allow us to do this at an award winning standard. This series must therefore be shot and episodes released during this period for maximum emotional impact.WHERE TO WATCH IT?Watch the series directly on the homepage.Check it out!www.theviewspot.comThe average length of an episode will range from 10 – 20 minutes so as to easily be watched at any point in the day.In order to keep things insightful but also entertaining I’d like to have a good mixture of the below shooting perspectives:
Accessing certain players of each team and represent each of their points of view and processes throughout the period.
Accessing certain players and each team’s training camps and understanding what they do to prepare for the battle. 
Covering the full spectrum of the sport, its culture, and the individuals, which represent the teams and support the players.
The challenge in doing this is that the rivalry between the teams can be fierce and to capture this type of content as outsiders without damaging relations is a delicate balance between us, the players and the association.So unfortunately, because of this I’ll only be able to give a concrete shooting plan and episodes schedule closer to shooting.But luckily this is where our digital marketer will come in, keeping all our viewers informed and up to date while we shoot! Woohoo!Eventually, after an exciting journey with these guys in their preparations and life challenges what could be better than to view the ""Calcio Fiorentino 2019"" game LIVE?Yes folks.That will be our grand finale and brought straight to you!  
              

 

After the game, depending on our funding results, I’d like to screen some episodes of what happens after final and season are over. The more support from you, the more we can show you! 
FUNDING & REWARDS:
Keeping in mind that this project aims to be operated over the course of six months on a semi ""LIVE"" basis, the budget will cover the following: 

Hiring of the crew: cinematographer / editor / sound technician / digital marketer.
Shooting equipment and consumables.
Fees to shoot the players.
A fee to shoot the main tournament in June paid to the association. 
Accommodation & travel expenses.
Daily production & general expenses. 
Marketing and distribution expenses.
Musical rights. 
Insurance.

This first phase of funding allows the production to commence and complete the production half way. The next phase's goal will cover the remainder of the show as well as the finale. There is always the risk that the campaign won't hit it's goal. Should this happen I will evaluate what can be created with the funds raised and if that would be something engaging and of high quality. Alternatively if that's not possible, I will hold onto the funds, evaluate what can be improved and launch another campaign till I hit the target. 
As a financial participant in the show, I have provided a list of rewards, structured in a way to guarantee delivery even in the event of the worst unexpected scenarios as a gesture of gratitude for your participation! These rewards are of high value based on the exclusive access that will be gained through this show to a culture not always open to the public. 
Does this sound exciting or what??!
MOODBOARD:


  A VERY BRIEF HISTORY ON THE SPORT AND CULTURE:   As mentioned in the beginning, CALCIO STORICO FIORENTINO’S origins come from Ancient Greece in the form of the so called Sferomachia which the Romans eventually adopted and transformed into a new version called Harpastum.Renowned personalities like Julius Caesar and his legionnaires played this game regularly as practice for battle and it was implemented as regular training of all Roman soldiers throughout the Roman Empire.Eventually, the colony of Florentia was established by the same Roman legionnaires that practiced it regularly. This game then became an essential part of the Florentine culture and its name was changed to Calcio Fiorentino.Most of this history can be found online and in the spirit of keeping things brief, please refer to the FAQ section for more historical information. TOP 5 FUN FACTS OF THE GAME!  TEAMSFour teams represent the four principle districts of Florence. Each district and team is named after the main cathedral and wears the representative color as follows: Santo Spirito (Whites) / Santa Maria Novella (Reds) / Santa Croce (Blues) / San Giovanni (Greens).PLAYERSEvery year, each district has a camp of 50 competitors of which only 27 of the most skilled, strongest and bravest make it to the tournament. Not for the faint hearted. SUBSTITUTIONSNo substitutions are allowed at any time including if a player is so injured that he has to stop playing.PRIZE MONEYThe only prize awarded is a sponsored dinner to the winning team that they enjoy battered and bruised after the game. Other than that it’s all honor and passion.3 PROTECTIVE RULES (THE ONLY ONES)These rules were created only recently to prevent malicious injury which used to happen in high frequency in previous years:
No striking an opponent from behind (striking refers to punches, kicks and similar tactics; rugby-style tackles are still permitted).
No striking an opponent who is already on the ground. You may pin somebody down, however.
No ganging up. If an opponent is already physically engaged with one of your teammates, you may not touch him unless he is carrying the ball.

In the context of the United States in 2019, the series addresses St. Louis’, and society’s, hesitance to come to terms with its troubled past, through the lens of captivating interviews from St. Louis’ most misunderstood residents.The ultimate goal, and result, of the Smoke City documentary series is to bring together the many corners of St. Louis, uplift our commonalities instead of our differences, and set the stage for a prosperous and more inclusive St. Louis experience, for every resident of any demographic.​What's Unique About Smoke City: Ultimo?Smoke City: Ultimo is the third, and final, installment of the Smoke City series. While Seasons 1 and 2 were broken up into episodes, Smoke City: Ultimo will be Cami Thomas’ first ever full-length feature, as a full-scale 120 minute documentary. Preceding wide-scale national distribution, there will be over a dozen live screenings and Q&A sessions across St. Louis. Screenings will be held in middle school, high school, and college campuses in the city, as well as select organizations that would like to bring the screening, and attached lesson plan/training, to their offices.​Screenings and increased guerrilla marketing throughout St. Louis City and St. Louis county will spread local reach to 3x compared to Season 2, at an estimated 10k unique viewers via live city screenings, an estimated additional 5k unique viewers through the local and national film festival circuit, and estimated additional 2k viewers in the international film festival circuit, and estimated 20k unique online viewers via FTCTVofficial.com. Coupled with the content rollout, will also be a robust guerrilla and web marketing campaign, with a three phase street team/postering strategy, an estimated 200k St. Louis area web impressions from social media ad campaign, display ads, and PPC web advertising. Smoke City has already been covered in national and local media.What will my contributions be used for?Contributions will go towards:Public programming, educational programming to run in conjunction with the documentary (middle schools, high schools, youth programs, work/office settings) to teach about implicit biases and how to challenge your own, to make for a more inclusive city.Film festival submission feesProduction gear and costsClosed captioning file cost (to have captions in English and Spanish)Artist fees for film scoring (done by an STL producer)Additional FTCTV programming Who are we?FTCTV is spearheaded by St. Louis director and producer Cami Thomas. In addition to creating documentary content (featured in Teen Vogue, NPR, ALIVE Magazine, St. Louis Mag and more), Thomas also touts a robust formal business background. Following internships at The World Trade Center New Orleans and ALIVE Magazine, Thomas has gone on to work in marketing and sales for Tesla Motors, and most recently as the Field Marketing Specialist and Culture Marketing Specialist for Red Bull North America.​Calvin Tigre has been an integral eye for FTCTV productions, including acting as Assistant Director for both seasons of the Smoke City documentary series. Calvin is the leader of the Ursa Major musical duo, freelance videographer, and long-time St. Louis advocate and resident.  Alexena Lopez is a User Experience Designer with an eye for building more inclusive, empathy-based solutions for companies in the St. Louis area.

<h2>The Plot</h2>
<p>The story follows Fletcher Fitzgerald, seeking to find out what happened to his Father who mysteriously died at Crowl Corporations 15 years before. However, when given a fatal diagnosis, Fletcher must fight against time as he learns the truth about his Father, The Soul Double Initiative and what it means to be truly human.</p>
<h2><strong>The Team</strong></h2>
<p><b>Matt Wright - Director/Writer</b></p>
<p>This is our very last production whilst at Ravensbourne University in London, and I know that I want it to go out with a bang! It's a story that I have been passionate about writing and I cannot wait to realise it to screen.  We really appreciate all the support towards our project. </p>
<p><b>Rebecca Bardon - Producer</b></p>
<p>We are super excited to start working on Fletchers' journey with The Soul Double Initiative and any help that you can give to us will really help the potential of our work. Even if you are unable to donate, please share our link amongst friends and families so we can reach larger audiences! We cannot wait to share how the story unfolds with you all. </p>

The story follows Fletcher Fitzgerald, seeking to find out what happened to his Father who mysteriously died at Crowl Corporations 15 years before. However, when given a fatal diagnosis, Fletcher must fight against time as he learns the truth about his Father, The Soul Double Initiative and what it means to be truly human.
The Team
Matt Wright - Director/Writer
This is our very last production whilst at Ravensbourne University in London, and I know that I want it to go out with a bang! It's a story that I have been passionate about writing and I cannot wait to realise it to screen.  We really appreciate all the support towards our project. 
Rebecca Bardon - Producer
We are super excited to start working on Fletchers' journey with The Soul Double Initiative and any help that you can give to us will really help the potential of our work. Even if you are unable to donate, please share our link amongst friends and families so we can reach larger audiences! We cannot wait to share how the story unfolds with you all.

My name is Kaili Turner and I'm a New York Actor, Producer and Writer that is a huge fan of Sex in the City. Watching those episodes was like hanging out with my best girlfriends every meet up. The only thing missing, were the women of color and the realer than life situations that can occur. I would be remiss if I didn't mention how comedy shapes everything around me.</p><p>I'm truly a lover of laughter and joy with some raunchy comedy thrown in. 90's television also helped to shape what I saw as the vision for this web series. Martin punchlines with Living Single woman power, and thus I created Fk'd Up &amp; Fabulous, a web series that follows 5 crazy women, dealing with real life, love and relationships in 2017 gentrified Brooklyn.</p><p>Fk'd Up &amp; Fabulous also came out of some of the Fk'd up, yet fabulous situations my sister and co-writer Fari and I often found and still do find ourselves in whenever we get together. This series is based on some of the craziest real life situations, that one would think it was all artistic license. It's important to have stories told that we can all relate to, and Fk'd Up &amp; Fabulous is just that for the melanated woman 30 and up (Jay-Z did say it's the new 20)!!! </p><p><b>The Fabulous Message</b></p><p>Fk'd Up &amp; Fabulous is truly a passion project, but the only way to bring this dream to fruition and to a screen near you, is through your awesome donations! </p><p>****We are looking to raise $16,000 to complete this project!!!****</p><p>Here is what we'll use the funds for:</p><p><i>Pre-Production:</i></p><ul>

I have been fortunate enough to have both of these. Unfortunately, living, working  and trying to create in New York City is hard.  Living and working most places is hard work, but I'm taking the risk and putting my baby (this web series) out into the world.  It's important to have a show that can show women over the age of 30 as full women that are still sexy, still figuring this life shit out and can give face while doing it. It's equally, if not more important, to show women of color as fully colorful beings and not just Black, but Latina, Native American and Asian. We are more than the quirky friend next door, or the sassy sidekick (although we can be those things too), we embody all of it and hold each other down in the process.</p><p><strong>In Total</strong></p><p>We understand that not everyone is able to give a monetary donation, so we would be equally as grateful if you use the Indiegogo share tools to like, subscribe, follow, and share our campaign.

My name is Kaili Turner and I'm a New York Actor, Producer and Writer that is a huge fan of Sex in the City. Watching those episodes was like hanging out with my best girlfriends every meet up. The only thing missing, were the women of color and the realer than life situations that can occur. I would be remiss if I didn't mention how comedy shapes everything around me.I'm truly a lover of laughter and joy with some raunchy comedy thrown in. 90's television also helped to shape what I saw as the vision for this web series. Martin punchlines with Living Single woman power, and thus I created Fk'd Up & Fabulous, a web series that follows 5 crazy women, dealing with real life, love and relationships in 2017 gentrified Brooklyn.Fk'd Up & Fabulous also came out of some of the Fk'd up, yet fabulous situations my sister and co-writer Fari and I often found and still do find ourselves in whenever we get together. This series is based on some of the craziest real life situations, that one would think it was all artistic license. It's important to have stories told that we can all relate to, and Fk'd Up & Fabulous is just that for the melanated woman 30 and up (Jay-Z did say it's the new 20)!!! The Fabulous MessageFk'd Up & Fabulous is truly a passion project, but the only way to bring this dream to fruition and to a screen near you, is through your awesome donations! ****We are looking to raise $16,000 to complete this project!!!****Here is what we'll use the funds for:Pre-Production:

The Break DownWe need $16,000 to cover the usual expenditures for producing quality content.  Even if we don't reach our intended goal, your funds will help us to get started and be able to seek grants that offer match funding or to even request a business loan if we have to.  At the end of the day, we need to show there is interest in our content, and your donation would go a long way.  We also need people to share our campaign.  So however you choose to support us, we would greatly appreciate it.  If you tell 20 friends and they donate, send us a note and we will give you a very special shout out on our SM platform.Risks & ChallengesCreating is always risky.  Taking an idea from the page to the stage or screen is scary and expensive.  In order to be successful, one needs a talented team and strong drive. I have been fortunate enough to have both of these. Unfortunately, living, working  and trying to create in New York City is hard.  Living and working most places is hard work, but I'm taking the risk and putting my baby (this web series) out into the world.  It's important to have a show that can show women over the age of 30 as full women that are still sexy, still figuring this life shit out and can give face while doing it. It's equally, if not more important, to show women of color as fully colorful beings and not just Black, but Latina, Native American and Asian. We are more than the quirky friend next door, or the sassy sidekick (although we can be those things too), we embody all of it and hold each other down in the process.In TotalWe understand that not everyone is able to give a monetary donation, so we would be equally as grateful if you use the Indiegogo share tools to like, subscribe, follow, and share our campaign. And if you can get 20 friends to share or donate, hit us up on IG and we'll give you a special shout out!!!Cast & CrewMeet the incredibly talented cast and crew working on this amazing project:Kaili Y.

<p><strong>Joan Macbeth – Writer, Director, Executive Producer</strong></p>
<p>“The need to make a living in my twenties forced me to abandon my artistic dreams entirely. But one job led to another, to another; and when I started my own business, I felt that, in a way, it was a creative outlet. I wasn’t creating art, but I was creating something.” Joan’s success in the business world led to a windfall that enabled her to retire at the age of 42. Since then she has pursued her life-long goal of being a writer. A few years in, she discovered screenwriting and hasn’t looked back. “Every once in awhile, I even get paid to write something.""</p>

<p><strong>Stevie Jackson – Writer, Executive Producer, ""Charlotte Chandler""</strong></p>
<p>""The first time I got paid to act, it was right out of school. It was an original show for a fringe festival, and we all walked away with $50 each for four months' work. You do not want to break that down by the hour, but it was very exciting. I still have a photocopy of the cheque."" Stevie knows intimately the balancing act that is pursuing a professional creative career while also paying the bills with a day job - something she's been doing for years. ""As creatives, we accept that often most our money has to come from another source for quite a long time, but the feeling of getting paid to do what you love? There's just nothing like it.""</p>

<p><strong>Pam Kearns – ""Louise Lassiter""</strong></p>
<p>Pam’s love of acting began during her girlhood in Montreal. At age 17 she enrolled in full-time theatre school, playing lead roles in both classical and modern dramas. She was thrilled to book a part in a Hollywood film her final year of theatre school. Next she planned a move to Toronto to join the bustling film community there, but love intervened. “Or as they say, ‘Life is what happens when you’re busy making other plans!’” She met her husband John, and life and love put Pam’s acting career on hold. While raising their two children, Pam found a creative outlet as a professional chef. “I always knew I would return to acting,” Pam says. “The love of the art fuels me, and I am committed to my craft. Getting paid for it is like gravy – delicious gravy!”</p>

<p><strong>Jane Avery – ""Gabe Griffin""</strong></p>
<p>“I think the ultimate goal for any actor or artist is to earn their living solely on their art, but I've yet to see it in my community. And I doubt I ever will. I've made my peace with that 100%.” Jane has been involved in the Vancouver acting community since 2007. “It's almost like a dirty secret that we have to have day jobs to make ends meet while pursuing our creative path. Even top-shelf local actors don't really talk about it, but I think we should because how else will the newbies get a grip on reality when they graduate? And how else will we begin to stop feeling bad about ourselves that we need these joe-jobs? But I'm happy to be here. We support each other, creating our own content, not waiting for the phone to ring.”</p>

<p><strong>Mirella Gibeau – ""Marigold""</strong></p>
<p>As the eldest child of immigrant parents, Mirella felt a duty to pursue a “professional” career, even though her passion was in the arts. She became a teacher. “I loved teaching and it was an honour to nurture creativity, and witness some brilliant young artists find their voices. But my own artistic growth was shelved.” When she retired, Mirella relocated to Vancouver to revisit her love of acting. “Although this is a creative field, it is also a business. I am grateful I have a pension because it's super competitive and I'm up against women in my age demographic who've been in the industry for forty years. It takes money to invest in headshots, classes, media presence and networking. It's not easy. But it makes me feel more alive than I've felt in years!”</p>

<p><strong>Shelley Janzé – ""Head of Accounting""</strong></p>
<p>Shelley began acting later in life, as her kids prepared to go off and build their own lives, and the empty nest was looming. With the support of her husband, she thought it would be fun to be in a commercial or two. One class led to another, which led to student and indie films, headshots, an agent, and, before she knew it, Shelley was hooked on acting. No empty nest syndrome for her. “Being financially secure, I’m fortunate that I don’t have to rely on making a living to pursue acting. Any paid gigs are icing on the cake.”</p>

As Charlotte negotiates her need for work against her desire for a life as an artist, her perspective of the day-to-day grind struck a chord with me, and will perhaps also ring true for anyone else who has ever worked in an office.”</p><h3> </h3><h3>Risks and Challenges</h3><p>We won't lie - honestly!

Well, besides the satisfaction of helping artists, we offer some exciting perks and our undying gratitude.Are YOU an artist working in a corporate cubicle? Secretly writing that screenplay in your spare moments, as you toil at the day job? Or moonlighting on the weekends, putting that art degree to good use? Let us make you comfortable outside your comfort zone when you join us at the $200, $300 or $350 contribution levels. Work on set, be an actor for a day, or for $750 you can even be an associate producer.Is that a little out of your price range? How about a copy of the series, complete with exclusive special features? A cool t-shirt that proclaims your support? A signed poster? We've got you covered. A contribution at any level will get you a sneak preview of Honestly Charlotte: The Series – prior to its release to the public!Remember, art of all kinds is an important aspect of civilization. The world needs you!Our plan is in place, scripts are polished, the cast is excited, and so are we. We are good to go and all we need is the rest of the funding.And if you cannot contribute financially, you can still help by telling your friends and sharing on social media. Help us spread the word, and you get that undying gratitude we mentioned.Any amount helps. Seriously. Anything.Thank you! 
Cast & Crew Stories
 

Joan Macbeth – Writer, Director, Executive Producer
“The need to make a living in my twenties forced me to abandon my artistic dreams entirely. But one job led to another, to another; and when I started my own business, I felt that, in a way, it was a creative outlet. I wasn’t creating art, but I was creating something.” Joan’s success in the business world led to a windfall that enabled her to retire at the age of 42. Since then she has pursued her life-long goal of being a writer. A few years in, she discovered screenwriting and hasn’t looked back. “Every once in awhile, I even get paid to write something.""
 


Stevie Jackson – Writer, Executive Producer, ""Charlotte Chandler""
""The first time I got paid to act, it was right out of school. It was an original show for a fringe festival, and we all walked away with $50 each for four months' work. You do not want to break that down by the hour, but it was very exciting. I still have a photocopy of the cheque."" Stevie knows intimately the balancing act that is pursuing a professional creative career while also paying the bills with a day job - something she's been doing for years. ""As creatives, we accept that often most our money has to come from another source for quite a long time, but the feeling of getting paid to do what you love? There's just nothing like it.""
 

Pam Kearns – ""Louise Lassiter""
Pam’s love of acting began during her girlhood in Montreal. At age 17 she enrolled in full-time theatre school, playing lead roles in both classical and modern dramas. She was thrilled to book a part in a Hollywood film her final year of theatre school. Next she planned a move to Toronto to join the bustling film community there, but love intervened. “Or as they say, ‘Life is what happens when you’re busy making other plans!’” She met her husband John, and life and love put Pam’s acting career on hold. While raising their two children, Pam found a creative outlet as a professional chef. “I always knew I would return to acting,” Pam says. “The love of the art fuels me, and I am committed to my craft. Getting paid for it is like gravy – delicious gravy!”
 

Jane Avery – ""Gabe Griffin""
“I think the ultimate goal for any actor or artist is to earn their living solely on their art, but I've yet to see it in my community. And I doubt I ever will. I've made my peace with that 100%.” Jane has been involved in the Vancouver acting community since 2007. “It's almost like a dirty secret that we have to have day jobs to make ends meet while pursuing our creative path. Even top-shelf local actors don't really talk about it, but I think we should because how else will the newbies get a grip on reality when they graduate? And how else will we begin to stop feeling bad about ourselves that we need these joe-jobs? But I'm happy to be here. We support each other, creating our own content, not waiting for the phone to ring.”
 

Mirella Gibeau – ""Marigold""
As the eldest child of immigrant parents, Mirella felt a duty to pursue a “professional” career, even though her passion was in the arts. She became a teacher. “I loved teaching and it was an honour to nurture creativity, and witness some brilliant young artists find their voices. But my own artistic growth was shelved.” When she retired, Mirella relocated to Vancouver to revisit her love of acting. “Although this is a creative field, it is also a business. I am grateful I have a pension because it's super competitive and I'm up against women in my age demographic who've been in the industry for forty years. It takes money to invest in headshots, classes, media presence and networking. It's not easy. But it makes me feel more alive than I've felt in years!”
 

Shelley Janzé – ""Head of Accounting""
Shelley began acting later in life, as her kids prepared to go off and build their own lives, and the empty nest was looming. With the support of her husband, she thought it would be fun to be in a commercial or two. One class led to another, which led to student and indie films, headshots, an agent, and, before she knew it, Shelley was hooked on acting. No empty nest syndrome for her. “Being financially secure, I’m fortunate that I don’t have to rely on making a living to pursue acting. Any paid gigs are icing on the cake.”
 
Sarah Hedar – Associate Producer“I once read a quote on a fridge magnet that said ‘Speak the truth, but leave immediately after,’ but what if you have spoken this truth to someone who has the power to hire you for a job - one that you need to make ends meet?” Sarah directed the original film Honestly Charlotte, and joins the team now as Associate Producer. “I was reminded of some of my own experiences juggling 'real' jobs while pursuing my own artistic endeavours. As Charlotte negotiates her need for work against her desire for a life as an artist, her perspective of the day-to-day grind struck a chord with me, and will perhaps also ring true for anyone else who has ever worked in an office.” Risks and ChallengesWe won't lie - honestly! Production and post-production delays sometimes happen and there's a possibility that we'll encounter unforeseen challenges that are beyond our control. We'll do everything we can to avoid that, but if it should happen, we promise to keep you updated the whole way. Frequently Asked Questions:Q. I see you are fundraising in Canadian dollars. Can I contribute from another country?A. Yes! Your credit card will be charged in your currency and we’ll receive Canadian dollars. In some cases, this means your money might go further. For instance, if you’re American and you donate $100 CAD, it will cost you about $75 USD.Q. What does a “flexible” goal mean?A. It means that the campaign isn’t all or nothing. If we don’t make our goal, we’ll still receive your contribution and it will go towards making the show.Q. What happens if you don’t make your goal? Will you still make the show? Will I still get my perk?A. Yes and yes, but it will all take us longer, because we’ll need to raise the rest of our budget. If that happens, we’ll keep you informed of our adjusted timelines.Q. What happens if you exceed your goal?A. First of all, we will be SO EXCITED. All “extra” funds will go toward making the highest quality show possible (better/more equipment, a bigger crew, etc.).Q. I want to help but I can’t contribute financially. Is there anything else I can do?A. First of all, we totally understand, and we so appreciate your support. The most helpful non-financial thing you can do is to help promote the campaign so it reaches more people. Thank you!Do you have a question we missed? Get in touch with us via the “ask a question” link above!Thanks again! We look forward to sharing Honestly Charlotte's journey with you.",11.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Become a Part of <i>Skeleton Crew...</i>
</h3>
<p>In December 2014, the first draft of a play called <i>Skeleton Crew </i>was completed. From the first read thru of this piece, it was clear the potential was there for something more. Since that time, thousands of people have tuned in to watch the adventures of Anthony, Hunter, and the rest of the characters in <i>Skeleton Crew. </i>The series has become a platform for people and ideas on the fringes of society, and will continue to do so as long as the series exists. Produced by SideKick Productions, whose mission is promoting size-blind casting whenever appropriate and possible, <i>Skeleton Crew </i>has connected with audiences in ways I never imagined. We have been fortunate enough to work with talent from all levels of the industry, including founder of Troma Studios and father of the Toxic Avenger, Lloyd Kaufman, who makes a cameo in Season One. We focus on LGBTQ themes heavily, and our connection with the bear community has brought us in contact with Bear World Media this past year. Bear World Media has licensed our series and we now appear on Revry.tv as well as YouTube.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Season Three</h3>
<p>For Season Three, we are attempting to go bigger in scope. <i>Skeleton Crew </i>has been self-funded for the first two seasons, but doing so going forward <i>and </i>accomplishing all of our plans for Season Three will be difficult without outside assistance. Any donation we receive will go towards making this happen, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rental of The WayStation, the fabulous bar which serves as our home away from home, MoneyShot$</li>
<li>Rental of studio space</li>
<li>Costumes</li>
<li>Set pieces </li>
<li>Potential special FX</li>
<li>Potential short animation segment for Episode 9</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Season Three of <i>Skeleton Crew </i>has been completely written and is in pre-production. No matter what happens, we will be producing this season of the series. Therefore there are no risks involved, and the only challenges are on the production team figuring out how best to navigate the budget.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell your friends about the series. This is huge--the more people who watch <i>Skeleton Crew </i>on Revry.tv or YouTube, the more potential we have for sharing our wacky, zany, melodramatic-tragicomic view of the world!</li>
<li>Share our fund-raising efforts</li>
<li>Write to us and let us know what you think about the series. The cast and crew love to hear fan reactions, and your support means the world to us!</li>

He discovered the extravagant world of balloon art being practiced around the globe and started a business.</p><p style=""font-weight: 600;text-align:  left;padding-bottom:30px;"">As he practiced and learned balloon artistry, a character emerged who embodied everything Louis wanted to express — love, light, magic, acceptance.

Ballooonieville is just that place where kids can go and escape for a moment in the day.”—Louis Lucas, aka Louie Balloonie 

With your investment, we will create a magical animated balloon utopia where negative experiences are transformed into mind-changing, attitude-shifting, toe-tapping, and spirit-lifting scenarios. This 6-part 3D animated video series will feature Louie Balloonie, our upbeat wizard; Mr. Needles, the sour villain; and a host of balloon creatures, unlike any creatures you’ve ever seen — a “never give up” dog, “a girl power” elephant, a “be yourself” panda, a “bravery” lion, and a “kindness” Giraffe.
Here’s how we’ll use the video series:

Grow our audience organically on YouTube and social media
Create lesson plans for early educators that will feature the videos and be focused on behavioral and experiential learning for young children
Seek a partnership with a streaming service like Netflix or a television network to spread our message to as many kids as possible!

The Balloonieville series is hosted by Louis Lucas aka the Balloon Wizard “Louie Balloonie”. He created the Balloonieville series out of an intense desire to make the world a better place.Louis' StoryLouis is determined, fearless, and passionate about creating a magical world where kids can escape troubled circumstances and feel true acceptance and love. Balloonieville and the desire to create it has intensely personal roots. At a young age, Louis found himself on a journey that would last several years and include homelessness, mental abuse, a suicide attempt, and brief confinement in a mental hospital.Through sheer will and the kindness of others, Louis got a job at a school and started college. It was hard, but two things happened during this time that would shape Louis’ life purpose — one, he worked with children who had experienced difficulties like his and worse, who lived in poor areas where teachers funded anything glamorous or fabulous themselves; and two, he began to research business ideas where he could use his ample imagination. He discovered the extravagant world of balloon art being practiced around the globe and started a business.As he practiced and learned balloon artistry, a character emerged who embodied everything Louis wanted to express — love, light, magic, acceptance. The Balloon Wizard Louie Balloonie was born!

In Balloonieville, we know how to change minds, hearts and spirits because we’ve Done, Done Did It before!
With our music videos and balloon entertainment, we have seen children come alive with enthusiasm. Our signature blend of balloons, imagination, and music is a proven vehicle to promote self love, equality, perseverance, girl power, and good old fashioned kindness.

We’ve already invested in the “Done, Done Did It!” video, and we ask that you invest in yourself and your community by continuing to spread the message of equality and kindness through our animated series.

<h3>Why Goodbye Friendly Buddy?</h3>
<p>My name is Morgan Wright and I study film production at Emerson College with a focus in animation. I am in my Junior year and have had my work play on MTV and at the Cannes Short Film Corner. By contributing to this project, you will help our friendly buddies come alive in a tactile world and have their experiences reach audiences young and old. This project is my most ambitious yet and I have a talented cast and crew helping me bring this unique world to life.</p>
<p>Goodbye Friendly Buddy is a children's series I am directing as my thesis to earn my Bachelor's of Fine Arts degree from Emerson College. This project is deeply personal and very important to me. The series takes place in a world where the imaginary world and real world exist as one. It discusses issues of figuring out who you are and ideas behind gender fluidity. As I move into the ""real"" world after college, I wanted to make a series that analyzed how we perceive each other, often times solely based on our appearance. I want this series to acknowledge the discrimination that people may face because of how they identify or how they look. I truly hope that I am able to offer a  voice for children who feel like they sometimes don't belong in the world they live in. </p>
<p> </p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Where would the $2000 go?</strong></p>
<p>Pre-production: $550</p>
<ul><li>This would include the construction of props, supplies, and food for the crew. This is the most lengthy process of creating a stop-motion and we want to be able to purchase tools to help our crew be able to build props and sets in a more productive way.</li></ul>
<p>Production: $250</p>
<ul><li>We will be filming the stop-motion, buying the software for animating, purchasing green-screens and extra hard drives to store the films. </li></ul>
<p>Post-Production: $150</p>
<ul><li>We will be editing the final product in this stage.</li></ul>
<p>Marketing: $250</p>
<ul><li>This includes creating and distributing merchandise like posters, stickers, and anything else that we can do to get GFB out to the general public. </li></ul>
<p>Film Festival Fees: $450 </p>
<ul><li>After this film is made, we want to send it out to different festivals to let this series be seen by more people! </li></ul>
<p>Contingency: $350</p>
<ul><li>We need to set aside money in case of any emergencies!</li></ul>
<p>By donating money, we can offer you original artwork from our creative team and some customizable miniatures as well. We will also be giving away signed copies of the scripts and limited edition stickers. Original props used in the production will be available as well.</p>

What We Need & What You Get

We need $2000 to help pay for fabrication tools and supplies. It takes more than a lot of hot glue and paints to build a whole series.
The cast and crew are volunteering a lot of their time to help on this project, so we would like to be able to feed them while they work. 

Where would the $2000 go?
Pre-production: $550
This would include the construction of props, supplies, and food for the crew. This is the most lengthy process of creating a stop-motion and we want to be able to purchase tools to help our crew be able to build props and sets in a more productive way.
Production: $250
We will be filming the stop-motion, buying the software for animating, purchasing green-screens and extra hard drives to store the films. 
Post-Production: $150
We will be editing the final product in this stage.
Marketing: $250
This includes creating and distributing merchandise like posters, stickers, and anything else that we can do to get GFB out to the general public. 
Film Festival Fees: $450 
After this film is made, we want to send it out to different festivals to let this series be seen by more people! 
Contingency: $350
We need to set aside money in case of any emergencies!
By donating money, we can offer you original artwork from our creative team and some customizable miniatures as well. We will also be giving away signed copies of the scripts and limited edition stickers. Original props used in the production will be available as well.

<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>On behalf of Julito McCullum and the team over at 20seven Productions we thank you for visiting this Indiegogo Campaign!</p>
<p>This Indiegogo Campaign is to fund the Pilot episode of our TV series ""Change"". We will be shooting mid December to have it ready to pitch to cable networks and streaming services during 2018's pilot season which is Jan-March.</p>
<p>This TV series follows three friends on a journey to be on the A-list in the entertainment industry, but first they must overcome the struggles of their day to day life. </p>
<p>Julito McCullum has been an actor for over 14 years, he's most known for his lead roles in TV series such as HBO's ""The Wire"", The N's ""Miracles Boys"" (directed by Spike Lee), ""Law and Order"", ""Blue Bloods"", as well as films such as ""Akeelah and the bee"", ""The Inevitable defeat of Mister and Pete"",  ""Brotherly Love"", as well as many other projects. He is now stepping into the creator side of the business in creating his own TV series where he is the writer, producer and actor on the project. He's brought on an amazing director, Michael ""boogie"" Pinckney, who is Spike Lee's protege, who's been in the business for over 20 years, and a brilliant new writer Victoria D. Sharpe to create the series ""Change"".</p>
<p>As an actor for over a decade Julito decided it was time to share his story, as well as others and create a series that shows what artist REALLY go through in the entertainment industry.</p>

The Impact
Due to the demand of living here in Los Angeles and being a single mother, I am afraid that without your assistance we will not be able to get this amazing series online.

Risks & Challenges
Some of the challenges we face include getting permits for the hospital sets and securing locations that are withing our budget. Sharing one's art with the world is always risky however we have such faith in Cathcing breaks and hold high hopes that people will love and connect with our project
…In the words of Erykah Badu “Now keep in mind that we’re artists and we’re sensitive about our Sh*t”.

Broke, but like what we're about?
We know times are tough and we are all working hard for that money. If you are finding yourself short on funds but like what you see there's still plenty you can do to help! Follow us on Social Media and help us spread the word! Tell your friends, family and everyone you know!",0.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Hey everyone, Banner's Predicament is back with our second episode!  Our first episode was an absolute success thanks to help from you, and after 10 sci-fi conventions and screenings around the country, we're revved up to do it again!! </h3>
<h3>Here's a blurb from our first episode's fundraiser:</h3>
<p>""Our team includes veteran filmmakers and actors as well as scientists and programmers, who grew up watching the re-runs of the 1978-1983 TV show 'The Incredible Hulk' and absolutely loved it.  In fact, it inspired many of us to pursue the careers we've chosen.  We are producing (a second!) episode continuing the sophistication and spirit of the show.</p>
<p>Many of us have joined this project to honor the memory or give tribute to Actors Bill Bixby, Lou Ferrigno, and Jack Colvin, as well as the original show's Executive Producer Ken Johnson and amazing Composer Joe Harnell; to familiarize cutting edge science in a fictional fun setting; and simply for the celebration of this fantastical world!""</p>

<p><strong>HELLO, YOU CHUBBY LITTLE BASTARDS!</strong></p>
<p>Powered By Ice Cream is a show about Eric. Eric loves ice cream and junk food. Like the great explorers before him, Eric relentlessly scours the aisles of grocery stores looking for the newest, most intriguing flavors of junk so you don’t have to. He’s like a white trash Magellan.</p>
<p>But Eric’s penchant for junk food almost ruined his life. Eric struggled with Binge Eating Disorder for many years. The very food that brought him so much joy destroyed his physical and mental health.</p>
<p>With therapy and the support of his family, Eric made peace with food and found a way to keep his savory and sweet treats. Now, his mission in life is to promote a positive body image and tell you about his latest confectionary conquest.  Eric is living proof that you can have your ice cream cake and eat it, too.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING! WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE IS BORDERLINE PORNOGRAPHIC</strong></p>
<p>Gobs of hot fudge, the thickest chocolate chunks you’ve ever seen, freshly sugar-coated nuts…this is going to get graphic.</p>
<p>Sure, you’ve heard of the #foodporn trend, but Eric takes it to the next level. He’s going to show you EVERYTHING. Your eyes will not be able to unsee caramelized pretzels, potato chips, and buttery Ritz crackers entangled with M&amp;Ms and whole Peanut Butter Cups--all loving swirled into vanilla bean ice cream.  </p>
<p>If you’ve never been attracted to a bowl of ice cream, soon you will be. </p>
<p><strong>YOU ARE THE COOL RANCH TO OUR DORITOS LOCOS TACOS</strong></p>
<p>The Powered By Ice Cream pilot is already shot, but we need your help.  We know that giving up your hard earned money is a big deal, particularly when you could use it to buy something with the word ""nougat"" on the wrapper. </p>
<p>When you support this campaign, you will help us finish the editing process, complete sound design, and finalize post production.  Most importantly, you will also help us bring this show to everyone. We're almost there!  Upon completion, we will begin meeting with interested parties about the details of launch which will result in Eric turning into the globes most recognizable consumer of baked goods.  Powered By Ice Cream is something the world needs.  It’s unapologetic. It’s brutally honest. It’s going to make you hungry. Here is your opportunity to be a part of a show that is totally unique and focuses on humanity’s life source: Hydrogenated Oil--and other yummy un-pronounceable stuff.</p>
<p><strong>GET YER PERKS!</strong></p>
<p>This is ‘Merica and we don’t believe in getting somethin’ for nutin’!  Besides the bragging rights that go along with contributing to the Powered By Ice Cream pilot, you’ll also be rewarded deliciously.</p>
<p><strong>YOU NEED THIS IN YOUR LIFE!</strong></p>
<p>Can't help financially right now? Spread the word about Powered By Ice Cream like it's Cheetos cheese dust (That sh!t gets everywhere!).  Use those social media accounts and deliver the good news about a show that is actually worth watching.  </p>

<h3>""HIDE"" </h3>
<p>Will be a web series written, produced and directed by Jennifer Nash (me !) After acting for over 25 years in TV series like Star Trek Next Gen, Full House, Coach, Home Improvement, Sliders, and a bunch more - I've decided it's my turn to tell a story. </p>
<p>""Hide"" is a web series that is my absolute passion project. It's a sci-fi series that lends itself to social justice messages as all of the amazing Star Trek series have always done. But it's nothing like Star Trek. The first ten minute episode was filmed in the Pittsburgh area and cost $2,500 to get ""in the can"". Now, I hope to raise enough money to finish editing episode 1 and continue on with the next seven episodes.</p>
<p>If you contribute funding to this project, you may be part of something very big - and certainly something very cool. I'm creating a NON PROFIT production company to produce this series that will be the first of it's kind in the United States of America. And I think it's about time. The FIRST production company (that I've been able to find anyway) that will offer EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK across the board in the U.S. Including actors. Including everyone.  Anyone who knows the entertainment industry knows that women tend to make much less than men across the board. If one looks at  actors' salaries, the contrast is staggering. </p>
<p>The two other Golden Rule tenets this production company will hold itself to are:</p>
<p>No sexual or emotional harassment of anyone. EVER. NO toxic work environment.</p>
<p>Environmental responsibility INSISTED on by all at our Non Profit, including all vendors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Help us make a kick ass web series that you will LOVE and help us change the world for the better by doing so. I'm tired of words and broken promises. I want to DO, BUILD, CREATE, CHANGE.</p>
<p>Contributors of $100 or more will receive some sweet ""Hide"" swag. </p>
<p>Contributors of $1000 or more get some sweet swag and an Associate Producer Credit .</p>
<p>Contributors of $5,000 or more will receive some sweet swag, Associate Producer credit and a ""billboard"" at the end of an episode.</p>
<p>Contributors of of $10,000 or  more will get all of the above and an Executive Producer Credit - which comes with a stake in the game and a walk on part written JUST for THEM (or your daughter or nephew - anyone you choose to give it to!) </p>
<p>Contributors at ANY level will receive my undying gratitude and personal thanks!</p>
<p>I know making any kind of content like this sounds risky, but I've been plugging away and learning from the best for an awful long time.  Eight 10 minute episodes at $5,000 a piece is entirely doable with all the passionate actors and film makers I've met in the Pittsburgh area who are more than willing to work for low or no pay - that brings us to $40,000.  But since I HAVE been learning from the best - I'm asking for $50,000 to cover all that can and will go wrong plus MARKETING money! </p>
<p>My intention is to sell this series to one of the BIG ones after we have our total proof of concept and a built in audience! Come in at the beginning and share the ride. It's going to exciting!</p>
<p>If you can't spare any cash right now, please help us by sharing the word, high and low! Social media, old fashioned talking, smoke signals, share the You Tube trailer!!!! </p>
<p>If you're in Pittsburgh or close - reach out to me during Hiatus of MINDHUNTER and volunteer to make breakfast on the set, or hold a boom - any and all help is appreciated and welcome SOOO SOOO much!!!

When I was younger I was lucky enough to have a great-grandmother who sailed from Ireland to come to America to achieve the ""American Dream"". This series that I have created is a love letter to my family. It is based on ""the Children of Lir"", and other Irish fairy-tales I was told as a kid. Our series, ""Darling Child"", is about friendship, loyalty, and falling in love with a perfect stranger. There's some magic, some drama, and of course, some humor. By donating to our campaign, you will be apart of something as magical as the story. We have a predominately female cast,  a female show-runner, a female creator, and a queer writer. Everything is about acceptance, and creating content that we don't see everyday. </p>
<h3><strong>What the heck is this even about?</strong></h3>
<p>Darling Child, is about Alannah, a college drop out, that starts to have mysterious dreams that come true. She sets out on an adventure with her best friend, and her co-worker, to discover what exactly is going on with her. Along her journey, she discovers what her families history is, and falls in love with a perfect stranger. </p>
<h3>What can I do to help?</h3>
<p>Easy answer, tell everyone you know about our campaign! If you can't donate, don't worry! We want people to know that we are looking for help. If you're an artist, and want to help with the project, shoot me an email. If you want to donate, please do! Anything you can give is helpful, and will hopefully bring us to our goal. </p>
<p>The funding is going towards renting equipment, renting spaces, and giving back to those who have helped us already. No one is getting paid to work on this project. All of the cast and crew are volunteers. We are involved in the project, because we believe in it, and love the story we are telling. If we cannot reach our goal, we will using all of the money that we raised to create the best possible piece of art as possible.</p>
<p>All of our perks are going to be given to people who give money. If you can only give 1 dollar, we will give you a shout out, and a thank you message. If you give us all of our money, we will be forever grateful, and we will give you everything that we are offering to people.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>my name is Jonathan Gibson and I am the creator of, what I hope will become a reality not just online but on your television also. so a little about my self. I am a 35 year old father of three living in Midland Michigan. recently I had to deal with the unthinkable, which was losing my wife suddenly.  The pain never leaves, but I am starting to smile at our memories together. One of the things that has helped me through this was writing the first episode to 'MI Crime S.V, doing this helped me to keep my mind on something positive.  My wife was a huge fan of shows like this and I know she would love it if she were here with us.  I hope raise this money so that I can put my idea into a reality. With episode one already written, I feel that it has potential. </p>
<p>The aim through this campaign is to raise enough revenue to be able to create the pilot episode and get in on streaming and possibly even local broadcasting stations.  as you can imagine this is not a cheap project and we need a lot of input to make this work. </p>
<p>If you contribute to this project you will be helping me turn my idea into a reality. This project has helped me focus on what is true and not to go down the wrong path.  I also feel it will bring a show to an audience that normally would not watch a crime show. </p>

<p>""Set entirely in their one-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles, CA, Slightly Crowded follows three girls with different jobs, lifestyles and sleeping habits all sharing the same closet, among other things. As they individually try to forge their own paths and find their own way, they discover that the only possible way to succeed is if they're in it together... And sometimes even then, they still fail.""</p>
<p>Hello! My name is Tessa Rao, and I'm a recent acting graduate currently in LA. After living for a year with 6 girls in a crowded 2 bedroom apartment, I started to realise the ups, downs and endless humour that came with it. I began writing a script, and cut to a few months later, we are in the process of filming the Pilot Episode of ""Slightly Crowded""!</p>
<p>But we need your help. </p>
<p>This project has so much potential, but with a great project comes the great need for funding. ""Slightly Crowded"" fills a space in today's market that our team believes needs to be filled. Anyone who has left home has most likely experienced a similar living situation, and anyone who hasn't, probably will - crowded, messy, sometimes conflicted, but ultimately an experience that helps you grow and teaches you who you can lean on. </p>
<p>We plan to film the Pilot mid October, but before that, we need the means to make it happen! We are looking to raise $2000, to be used for props, filming equipment, meals and Craft Services. Any donation, big or small, would be extremely helpful and appreciated. We have some really cool perks too, including the chance to watch an early release of the Pilot, come to a private screening party, or get a limited edition poster, signed by the cast!</p>
<p>Finally, if you cant contribute, that doesn't mean you cant still help! If you're passionate about this project like we are, you can use the Indiegogo share tools to get the word out, and make some noise about the campaign! The more help we get, the more you give us the ability to succeed and do what we do best: tell stories and make you laugh! </p>
<p>For more information on the project, flick a message to emailme@tessarao.com. And keep an eye out for the beginning promo - coming very soon!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Carlton Thompson and I am a Detroit based filmmaker. I have been in the industry since 2010, but have been a story teller my whole life. I wanted to tell stories that touched people's lives and make them look at life in a different perspective. I love the collaboration and networking aspect of the industry. People coming together and bringing a story from paper to life has always been fascinating to me. This series is very personal to me because in 2015 my dad was diagnosed with kidney failure. His kidneys were damaged due to him having high blood pressure. Creating a series that can bring awareness to issues that people struggle with became a passion project of mine.</p>
<p>I truly believe that if people understood one another, then we would be closer to peace. This series has the potential to change the world in many positive ways. It all starts with connecting people. We as human beings need to look out for each other. It doesn’t matter what race, country, religion, and background we come from; we all feel emotion. It's time to let it out and talk it out. It takes more courage to reveal what you're experiencing than it is to hide it, but we all need to understand that there is healing in revealing. Helping each other heal is the purpose of this series. </p>
<p>The Circle is a support group where people come together from different backgrounds, experiences, addictions, personal issues, and struggles to discuss what they are going through, what they may have overcome, and how to get through it. It is about giving people the courage to speak up, reveal, and heal. We also want to bring awareness to many issues that go on in the world. Not only will this series be personal to me, it will be for our viewers as well. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">If we reach our goal of $10,000, that will allow us to pay for each episode. This includes our production crew, actors, and production cost. It will also allow us to market and shop the series on the festival circuit to bring more attention to the series. The cost per episode will be $1,000, with 7 episodes, and $3,000 for marketing and the festival circuit. If we were to raise anything beyond our goal, the extra money will roll over into Season 2. You're getting a series that will connect with almost anyone and hopefully change many lives in the world. </span>If we are unable to reach our goal,  then any money raised will go strictly into production for the first season.</p>
<p>We have unique perks for all who donate to our campaign. Please review each perk in detail to the right.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This series is about connecting and helping people. Martin Luther King Jr. said, ""You can't leave the house without depending on more than half the world."" This series can educate people, build communities, change lives, break barriers, and change opinions and perspectives. At the end of the day we are all humans that need to help each other. This will bring us closer to peace.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges </h3>
<p> Not reaching our goal would be an obstacle, however, I truly believe we will because anyone can relate to this series. This series connects to everyone and is about everyone. In reaching the goal of this series, we can help put an end to depression, long suffering, and past regrets. We have to learn how to move forward and know we are not alone in any direction we take. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please LIKE, INVITE, and SHARE our Facebook, The Circle TV Series, and Instagram, The Circle Series. Have all your friends and family to do the same. This series is for you and everyone you know. This is a movement that we are steadily growing. We hope that through people believing in what we are trying accomplish, we can change the world for the better. It starts with changing lives.</p>

<h3>What Is Wizazon?</h3>
<p>Wizazon is a magical scripted podcast that's accessible to anyone and everyone. No mooching off someone's Netflix account, all episodes are going to be completely free!</p>
<p>We welcome everyone to participate by listening, liking, and sharing our content. And if you want to be even more involved with this magical world, we welcome your donations!</p>
<p>The episodes are free but the work that goes into this project is not free. Everyone deserves compensation for their work, and while we might be starving artists who created a cool show, we don't want our actors, editors, and designers to go hungry. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>A lot of productions need funding for equipment and props, but our first priority is investing in people. Our second priority is equipment--we have decent recording equipment, but with a larger budget we'd like to rent a professional studio. </p>
<ul>
<li>Each episode costs roughly $1,000 to make because we are paying actors, sound editors, and EVERYONE who helps make the magic happen.<br/> </li>
<li>Recording studios in NYC cost from $60-$150 per hour. It would probably take about 3-5 hours to record one episode. <br/> </li>
<li>Your donations aren't just supporting our show, you also get cool perks--you could even become PART of the show! <br/> </li>
<li>If we don't reach our funding goal, we're still going to pay our collaborators as promised, but the bottom line is, the more support we have, the better the show will be. There's only 24 hours in a day, and all of us have survival jobs that we do in addition to our art. The more we can focus on our art, and the more our collaborators can focus on theirs, the better this show will be. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>People value your transparency. Be open and stand out by providing insight into the risks and obstacles you may face on the way to achieving your goal.</p>

<li>Describe your plan for solving these challenges.</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>I'm a filmmaker, comedian and indie media journalist</li>
<li>I want to see the truth about Russia with my own eyes</li>
<li>You will be helping me get the truth out about Russia to a western audience</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need $5000 to pay for my air travel, lodging and any travel costs for 10-14 days. Also to pay for an editor to take the hours of footage I will get and make a compelling short documentary.  If I only reach $3000 I can still go to Russia for 6-8 days and make the doc. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is important for people living in the West who have only been told one side of the Russia story. </p>
<p>I have successfully funded and delivered two crowdfunding projects. <strong><i>The Los Angles Podcast Festival</i></strong> and <strong><i>Ear Buds: The Podcasting Documentary</i></strong>. I have also directed <strong><i>Laffghanistan: Comedy Downrange</i></strong>. A doc about doing comedy for the US Military in Afghanistan. Director/Producer for 13 episodes of the <strong><i>FNX Comedy Experience</i></strong>. </p>
<p>Creator/Host of <strong><i>The Political Vigilante</i></strong>. Independent, progressive media show on Youtube. Regular on <strong><i>The Jimmy Dore Show</i></strong> and <strong><i>Aggressive Progressives</i></strong> on <strong><i>TYT</i></strong> .</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The challenge will be to go to a country where I do not speak the language and get average Russian people to talk to me on camera. Will the government allow this? I'm not sure. </p>
<p>I know a western journalist living in Moscow and a Russian guide that can help me navigate shooting on the streets of Moscow. I have shot docs in war zones, Japan and the Australian outback.

<p>I created this series because despite the progress we're making in mainstream media, the black experience is predominantly shown from an African-American perspective.

<p>Being black in The Ivory Coast is not identical to being black in Australia or Colombia. While we're all African descendants, one of the beautiful things about us as a race is that culturally we're everywhere. Each video will hone in on our similarities, while celebrating our differences.</p>
<p>When it comes to the diaspora, I've become fascinated with the unknown. Even in present day, countries such as Mexico only acknowledged their black population on the National Census in 2015. In a world where nations consider their most beautiful to be those with the closest proximity to whiteness, I always wonder: who else is getting overlooked? The more I research, the more I discover the presence of black populations that (more often than not) been around for centuries (e.g. India's black population that settled in the country 400 years ago). </p>
<p>Black Beyond America is my oppourtunity to document the countless nuances that make up the black experience world wide. While we've successfully made a few videos in California, it's time to start our international journey, which is where you come in! The series can only go so far if we don't visit the countries in question - whether it's sharing stories with those back in the UK, digging into the black experince in Russia, or visiting the Carribean islands my grandparents came from, we need your help.</p>
<p>No donation is too big or small. Any amount you can give will go towards food, travel, housing and paying the crew that'll make this happen.</p>
<p>In the long run, I aim to break the misconception that a black person's culture measures their worth in society. I aspire to have the series be part of a larger archive that is constantly being updated with new content, new experiences and new perspectives.</p>

We have developed a grassroots series that centers around an interracial family who own a bubble tea shop in the Metro Detroit area during the Covid-19 Pandemic. And we need your help!</p>
<p>When the pandemic hit in 2020, Dan noticed the lack of representation and alienation of different minorities and marginalized communities, both in film and television, and felt it became more amplified, especially Asian representation, both on screen and in production. Inspired by the Netflix show, <i>Kim’s Convenience</i>, Dan started to write up his own story. From there, he took to social media to pitched the idea of a show with good Asian representation both on screen and off funded through grassroots and community organizing. </p>
<p>Dan connected with other highly talented team members, most from Michigan, and formed an incredible production team that consists predominantly of BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) individuals and members of LGBTQ+ community. The project has grown to include a variety of intersectional identities and the complexities these identities have on the lives of the characters. </p>

<strong>Edith Arbor </strong>has an entrepreneurial spirit and hails from the Visayas region of the Philippines. She's juggling being a mother, an immigrant, and also trying to keep the family business a float with her husband and business partner, James. She moved to Michigan after marrying James and worked in a hospital as a nurse. Overtime, she and James decided to open a bubble tea shop and she soon left nursing to pursue her passion. She's extremely supportive of her children and wants them to peruse something they are passionate about. Sometimes, she struggles with relating to her children especially mental health wise.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>James Arbor </strong>is an African-American veteran who fought in the Middle East and is currently dealing with undiagnosed PTSD and anxiety. Much of this is stemmed from both fighting for a country he is constantly alienated in and dealing with the 2020 pandemic.  He's also very hesitant with taking major financial risks with the family business as any entrepreneur would be. Originally working in the automotive industry, James decided to pursue his passion as well of opening a family run business and soon left the automotive field. James' fellow veteran friend, Traverse, constantly butt-heads on world views and beliefs, but manage to be civil.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Louis Arbor </strong>is the oldest son. He works at a hospital in the business and finances department. Graduated with a technical writing degree from the University of Michigan, he's pursuing his passion, but ultimately wants to become a higher executive. Louis is also gay, but is not out and in a private secret relationship with his partner of a few years, Dr. Asa Coen. Louis also leans heavily conservative, providing more perspective as communities are not monoliths. His partner and Louis constantly debate over political matters, but are able to respect each other as well.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Visaya Ann Arbor </strong>is the middle daughter. She is currently attending Wayne State University pursuing a degree in counseling and psychology. She works at the family shop in between school and on the weekends. She tries to understand people through her studies, but struggles oftentimes to empathize, which is key for her field. Studying and working so much has given her a lot of stress and anxiety and she struggles with self-acceptance, even though her grades are excellent. Visaya tries to remain neutral regarding politics, and tries focus on her studies, although she would lean left.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Mindelina Arbor </strong>is the youngest child in the Arbor family. She is still attending high school and is not planning on attending college. Her passion is to be in media and dreams of being an influencer.  However, she deals with massive stage fright and oftentimes shuts down if people are watching her live. When she is alone, however, she feels confident and can express herself. Mindelina also has ADHD and juggling around high school, social media, and trying to keep up with the latest trends on TikTok, oftentimes shuts her down as well where every project is important, so no project is important, and this causes an endless cycle for her. Mindelina is also very vocal when it comes to racism and hatred. She's the opposite to her brother, Louis. </li>

<p><br/>They own a bubble tea shop in the fictional suburb of <strong>Verona Hills</strong> in the fictional county of <strong>Motorlake</strong>. Motorlake is located south of Oakland and Macomb, north of Wayne County and stretches from Livingston to Lake St. Clair. The county executive is <strong>Ruth Dovetail</strong>, a Native American woman with Odawa ancestry and the mayor of Verona Hills is a Muslim woman of South Asian heritage. There are several nearby suburbs, cities, and towns with the same name, as historically, many of these were part of the same town; Verona Woods, Verona Heights,  and Veronaopolis. </p>

<ul><li>
<strong>Bahay Kubo Tea</strong> is the name of the Arbor's boba tea shop business. It has been struggling during the 2020 pandemic and the family is trying to make ends meet. The name <i>Bahay Kubo </i>is what the traditional homes in the Philippines are called, also known as nipa huts, so the bubble tea shop has become a 2nd home for the family and the community. Decorated with Detroit memorabilia and fusion of traditional Filipino decor, the shop welcomes the community in and has become a relatively known shop in the area over time.  One could tell this is family run as they proudly show their family photos on their walls behind the counter as well as other memories. The shop has been in business for about three years, but the pandemic hit their finances hard.</li></ul>
<p><br/>The show has many characters from a wide range of intersectional identities, classes, ethnicities, and backgrounds and will explore mental health as well as how the pandemic, rise of racial hate crimes, social media, politics, and technology have impacted many of the communities from the perspective of BIPoC and other marginalized communities.</p>

<h3>Pilot Episode Funding</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Being grassroots means we seek to fund this project through collective community organization. It also means we, as representatives of our various diverse communities, control the entire production without the influence of corporate investors. We hope to raise $30,000 directly from the community to shoot the pilot for this series.</p>
<p>Your funds will help us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cast diverse talent that actually represents the rich diversity in our communities</li>
<li>Rent space and cover production related expenses</li>
<li>Compensate production team and cast members (many of whom have already volunteered many hours to this project!)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Identity-Conscious Casting</h3>
<p>Coined by Lavina Jadhwani in 2014, Identity-Conscious casting goes beyond color-blind or color-conscious casting.  They quote, ""because she believes identity contains multitudes and race is just one part of that."" which is what we at <i>Ebyssian Productions</i> strive for -- roles written &amp; casted for specific diverse and intersectional individuals. We believe that if the character in a story has a multitude of intersectional identifies (race, gender, sexuality, ability, age, etc.), then the actors and actresses that portray them should be as closely identical. This is to not only stay true to the story, but to allow those actors to bring their <u>lived experience</u> into the character. We acknowledge some wiggle room such as city of origin, political view, hobbies, careers, etc. but certain identities must match as close as possible with the characters we are portraying (and of course, strong acting skills). Race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, ability, age, etc. are some of the significant factors we take into account during casting calls.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We recognize that funding a television series poses a variety of challenges. Grassroots isn't a typical way to fund a television series, but we are inspired  by the way underrepresented and marginalized communities have used the internet to challenge this lack of representation and add their own voices to a growing body of diverse projects. We are confident that a community funded project will be better able to retain it's <i>Authenticity Through Humanity</i>.</p>
<p>The community as a whole benefits from authentic depictions of underrepresented communities. Our project engages this by seeking to challenge stereotypes and power dynamics we can all relate to. </p>

The community as a whole benefits from authentic depictions of underrepresented communities. Our project engages this by seeking to challenge stereotypes and power dynamics we can all relate to.

<p><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>Since the national attention and support brought to the Black Lives Matter Movement, as a result of the senseless murder of George Floyd, several stories have emerged about widespread systemic racism in this country--revealing how every aspect of our society has been built on a racial hierarchy that places Black people at the bottom.  And while more and more Black creators are finding ways to tell those stories on the big and small screen, few have exposed the experiences of Black professors teaching at predominantly white institutions.  The recent headlines about Professor Nikole Hannah-Jones’ fight for tenure at The University of North Carolina--Chapel Hill is just one of many stories of racism and microaggressions faced by the mere 6 percent of Black faculty at public and private colleges and universities across the nation.  And among tenured professors in higher education, just 2.1 percent are Black women.  This story exposes that truth, through a satirical lens of one young Black woman’s journey into that world.  Given the current racial climate in this nation, it’s a timely story that many young professionals will be able to relate to as they navigate the challenge of being authentic in the workplace, while also trying to push for social justice and change.</p>

With a BA in English Literature sitting in a drawer, Catarina, our creator, was finally ready to begin starting a journey to work for Disney, writing movies to inspire people all around the world. After months of researching, ideas for a web series began to become more enticing. Driven by a passion from her favorite show, <i>Xena: Warrior Princess</i>, the desire to create something meaningful manifested.<br/><br/>This unnamed project was being described as what would happen if an offspring of <i>Orange is the New Black</i> and <i>The L Word</i> had a child with a cross between <i>How I Met Your Mother</i> and <i>Switched at Birth</i>. In early 2017, the treatment and first season outline for <i>The Bech</i> were completed and looked over by several people. Months of feedback led to finally being ready to search for a crew. Alexis, who joined the team as the makeup artist, quickly became enamored by the premise. Soon, Alexis was named producer. Within weeks, Catarina and Alexis grew close and became the production team. With Catarina’s creativity and Alexis’ enthusiasm, they were able to pull together the start of a great cast and crew. Together, we are creating a web series with similar tones of <i>Orange is the New Black</i> and the feel of <i>How I Met Your Mother</i>. Many references can be found throughout the show to all of these shows - as well as several other works of fiction. <i>The Bech</i> is, first and foremost, a passion project meant to give representation and messages not often seen on television. </div><div>

<p><strong>Purpose:</strong><br/><br/>There are two core themes to <i>The Bech</i>: diversity and young adult life.<br/><br/>Having a greatly diverse set of characters… Each of these characters come from various backgrounds that offer them a different perspective on similar situations that they face. While these characters may not always get along, and some simply do not like other, they will find themselves in tense discussions. Everyone has their own, unique personality that is conveyed through dialogue, mannerisms, reactions, actions, and music.<br/><br/>Portraying the lives of college students at different parts of their lives… Learning to be an adult and becoming independent while trying to stay afloat in college work is something every character struggles with in their own ways. There is no one size fits all method of dealing with the stresses of young adult life. They are at an age where respect is rarely given, but expectations and responsibilities are thrust upon them from all directions. Figuring out who they are and where they fit in is just one of the many things they will discover.<br/><br/><br/><strong>The recurring tones on the show:</strong><br/><br/>Humorous/feel-good… Humor is a tool used by many of the characters to keep themselves from becoming overwhelmed - especially during enjoyable moments within the friend group. Characters tread lightly through uncomfortable situations by finding the balance between humor and drama to tackle difficult conversations. The show finds the balance between which topics can be portrayed through humor vs. drama. Inspiration for methods of portraying this greatly come from <i>Orange is the New Black</i> and <i>How I Met Your Mother</i>.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed… School, dating, work, financial aid… it can feel impossible to find some semblance of balance. For characters early in the coming out process or dealing with temperamental roommates, falling into a stressed state can be all too easy. <i>The Fosters</i> and <i>Switched at Birth </i>provided examples of how to handle young adults feeling in over their heads.</p>
<p>Passionate… Every character has something they are passionate about - some more than others. There will be several instances of some of the characters getting deeply passionate about a discussion, another person, or something going on in their lives. Although they may be close to someone, their passions do not always align with their friends. Part of growing up and growing close to others is learning how to respect that your loved ones may and will have different passions. This was an issue partially brought to attention in <i>The L Word</i>.</p>
<p>Compassionate...Through all of the moments, from feel-good to overwhelmed to passionate, these friends are there for each other. There is genuine love there. Several characters are the first to run in to comfort a friend, and many can empathize with what others are going through. This isn’t a group of friends that all identify the same way, but they have absolutely no difficulty sympathizing with one another. <i>The Bech </i>truly dives into complex relationships between friends - no matter their differences. A lesbian and straight woman can be close friends with no ulterior motives. A transgender woman and cisgender woman can live comfortably together without feeling even the slightest need to make their discussions circle around their identities. <br/>These characters are friends because of who they are… not what they are.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522739653/lvwsn4urd5tkfpsrgkwq.png"" src=""""/><br/><br/><i>""And I tried to remember any case in the course of my reading where two women are represented as friends…They are now and then mothers and daughters. But almost without exception they are shown in their relation to men. It was strange to think that all the great women of fiction were, until Jane Austen’s day, not only seen by the other sex, but seen only in relation to the other sex. And how small a part of a woman’s life is that.""<br/><br/>Virginia Woolf</i><br/><br/><strong>Breakdown:</strong><br/><br/>With this goal reached, we will be able to completely produce the first five episodes of the show. We have two seasons completely planned out, and the following two seasons are in the works! This isn't a temporary thing. We are in this for the long haul.</p>
</div><div> </div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522737623/ztyvkqmnywmtnrzmkfdd.png"" src=""""/><br/> </p>
<p>While our goal may seem like a random number, it's anything but. We've meticulously calculated the costs of everything from equipment to food to reimbursements to those awesome IndieGoGo fees. </p>
<p>Our entire budget for the first season greatly goes toward our cast and crew. Without a talented, passionate, and dedicated team, it's truly difficult to make something great. <br/><br/>We have filmed footage for our trailers that are currently in editing. All images and videos are from rehearsing for and filming the trailers. We begin filming this summer, so we're going full force on this IndieGoGo campaign to be able to bring you quality content.<br/><br/><strong>Pilot:</strong><br/><br/>Gabrielle has just moved to The Bech. We open with her exiting her apartment unit in a clearly frustrated state. As she’s leaving, she runs into Tiana. After the initial surprise of now living in the same apartment after not seeing each other much since they both started college, Gabrielle is introduced to Tiana’s roommate, Eliza. The three spend time in Tiana’s apartment, and Gabrielle and Eliza quickly bond by finding a shared interest in crazy Tiana stories. They each share a story before the scene changes as Gabrielle explains the tensions with her roommate. <br/><br/>Danielle opens her front door in the opening of the scene. Gabrielle introduces herself as Danielle’s new roommate. Danielle is studying at the kitchen table, and Gabrielle enters the apartment with a box. The two women discuss decorating the main areas of the apartment. They come to an awkward agreement. Before Gabrielle leaves her apartment in a huff, she and Danielle get into an argument over use of the shared space. Danielle insists she can’t do any work if she can see Gabrielle.<br/><br/>Tiana and Eliza give Gabrielle fake, unhelpful advice - ranging from “cutting the bitch” to “seducing her.” Their fun ends when Tiana has to go to her shift at the front desk. <br/><br/><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/siegen-bretzke/theme-song-for-the-bech-show"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Theme song: </strong></a><br/><br/>Walk away or see it through.<br/>Pick what do I have to lose.<br/>My whole world is turnin'.<br/>Bridges burnin'.<br/>It's time for my debut.<br/><br/><strong>First Five Episodes:</strong><br/><br/>""A Funny Thing, Luck ""<br/>Gabrielle moves into her new apartment and  is introduced and reintroduced to some of the residents of The Bech.<br/><br/>""My Friend is Gay""<br/>Leia is having a difficult time adjusting and meets Tiana, who tells her that she has a lesbian friend that may be able to help her. <br/><br/>""I See What You Mean"" <br/>Leia mistakes Eliza for Gabrielle.

After being diagnosed with an Autism Spectrum Disorder in her first year of university, she underwent major changes in life and is now in a leadership role. More often than not, she does not realize someone is flirting with her until a friend points it out or she has someone’s tongue on her ear. She has three years to figure something out before student loans and real life begin - all while living with her near polar opposite.</p>
<p>LOIS ENTIN is in her third year of her communications degree. Determined to not let her depressive disorder be the leading factor in her life, she finds strength in helping animals. Growing up, she dated people of various genders, but could never find an identity she felt comfortable enough to claim. Lois cares more about being her best self than putting herself into a category. </p>
<p>ALICE BETTON is cisgender and a third-year English and Theater double major who dreams of acting at the Shakespeare Globe Theatre. She is exceptionally outgoing and amicable, and is always convincing her roommates to throw parties. When she’s  not in party mode, she is in the mother role to the others. </p>
<p>DANIELLE THOMAS, a white woman, is a third-year physics student from England. She’s studious, blunt, focused, and impatient. Her idea of fun is watching a documentary with a glass of red wine, and she doesn’t read anything with a plot. As a surrogate to family, she has become close to the professor for whom she is a TA, and she has not seen her real family since her first winter break in America. Coming from a background of nobility, she considers herself far too focused on her studies to worry about judging people or taking notice of the variety of identities that live around her. </p>
<p>TIANA WILLIAMS is a second-year student and a straight, black woman studying biology on a pre-med track.  She’s full of qualities that are not generally seen together: intelligent, fun-loving, driven, heavy drinker, fiercely loyal friend, man-crazed, and studious. When in social settings, she lacks discretion with personal matters, often times sharing personal stories in great detail. While she’s always worked exceedingly hard in school, Tiana now has med-school applications on the horizon amongst all of her responsibilities at The Bech, but she sometimes can’t stop thinking about sex.</p>
<p>ELIZA SIMMONS, a woman of color, is a straight, first-year student studying student affairs. Her love for alcohol is rivaled only by her love for food. </p>
<p>LEIA CORINTH, a bisexual woman, is a first-year Radio-Television-Film student from Alaska with two dads. </p>
<p>SAMMIE SMITH is a more masculinely-dressed lesbian, third-year history major, and student athlete that was outed during an incident with another team. </p>
<p>ALEXANDER McALLEN, a gay third-year journalism student, is on the football team with a full ride that sees his sexuality as merely a small part of who he is.</p>
<p>JORDAN TAMLIN is Alice's cousin and a transgender woman studying engineering, who enjoys joking about the odds of her and her three roommates being women loving women.</p>
<p>JAKE WATERS is an aromantic sophomore, studying astrophysics. Along with a budding friendship with Danielle, he has connections to several other characters. </p>
<p>RENEE THOMAS, Danielle’s little sister, is in her senior year of high school. Her quick wit and sarcastic sense of humor make her stand out from her sister. </p>
<p>LANE RAY is pansexual and a fourth-year history major. His goofy personality is accompanied by a love for comics, sci-fi, and superheroes.</p>
<p>KATIE GOMEZ, a second-year business student, transfers to the school for the second semester. She keeps to herself, and everyone begins to wonder many things about her. </p>

“Growing up, I looked up to real women. I didn’t go in for the hero worship, and I still don’t. Everybody has feet of clay.”Lucy Lawless
 
The Idea:The Bech goes back to the summer of 2015. With a BA in English Literature sitting in a drawer, Catarina, our creator, was finally ready to begin starting a journey to work for Disney, writing movies to inspire people all around the world. After months of researching, ideas for a web series began to become more enticing. Driven by a passion from her favorite show, Xena: Warrior Princess, the desire to create something meaningful manifested.This unnamed project was being described as what would happen if an offspring of Orange is the New Black and The L Word had a child with a cross between How I Met Your Mother and Switched at Birth. In early 2017, the treatment and first season outline for The Bech were completed and looked over by several people. Months of feedback led to finally being ready to search for a crew. Alexis, who joined the team as the makeup artist, quickly became enamored by the premise. Soon, Alexis was named producer. Within weeks, Catarina and Alexis grew close and became the production team. With Catarina’s creativity and Alexis’ enthusiasm, they were able to pull together the start of a great cast and crew. Together, we are creating a web series with similar tones of Orange is the New Black and the feel of How I Met Your Mother. Many references can be found throughout the show to all of these shows - as well as several other works of fiction. The Bech is, first and foremost, a passion project meant to give representation and messages not often seen on television.

Purpose:There are two core themes to The Bech: diversity and young adult life.Having a greatly diverse set of characters… Each of these characters come from various backgrounds that offer them a different perspective on similar situations that they face. While these characters may not always get along, and some simply do not like other, they will find themselves in tense discussions. Everyone has their own, unique personality that is conveyed through dialogue, mannerisms, reactions, actions, and music.Portraying the lives of college students at different parts of their lives… Learning to be an adult and becoming independent while trying to stay afloat in college work is something every character struggles with in their own ways. There is no one size fits all method of dealing with the stresses of young adult life. They are at an age where respect is rarely given, but expectations and responsibilities are thrust upon them from all directions. Figuring out who they are and where they fit in is just one of the many things they will discover.The recurring tones on the show:Humorous/feel-good… Humor is a tool used by many of the characters to keep themselves from becoming overwhelmed - especially during enjoyable moments within the friend group. Characters tread lightly through uncomfortable situations by finding the balance between humor and drama to tackle difficult conversations. The show finds the balance between which topics can be portrayed through humor vs. drama. Inspiration for methods of portraying this greatly come from Orange is the New Black and How I Met Your Mother.
Overwhelmed… School, dating, work, financial aid… it can feel impossible to find some semblance of balance. For characters early in the coming out process or dealing with temperamental roommates, falling into a stressed state can be all too easy. The Fosters and Switched at Birth provided examples of how to handle young adults feeling in over their heads.
Passionate… Every character has something they are passionate about - some more than others. There will be several instances of some of the characters getting deeply passionate about a discussion, another person, or something going on in their lives. Although they may be close to someone, their passions do not always align with their friends. Part of growing up and growing close to others is learning how to respect that your loved ones may and will have different passions. This was an issue partially brought to attention in The L Word.
Compassionate...Through all of the moments, from feel-good to overwhelmed to passionate, these friends are there for each other. There is genuine love there. Several characters are the first to run in to comfort a friend, and many can empathize with what others are going through. This isn’t a group of friends that all identify the same way, but they have absolutely no difficulty sympathizing with one another. The Bech truly dives into complex relationships between friends - no matter their differences. A lesbian and straight woman can be close friends with no ulterior motives. A transgender woman and cisgender woman can live comfortably together without feeling even the slightest need to make their discussions circle around their identities. These characters are friends because of who they are… not what they are.""And I tried to remember any case in the course of my reading where two women are represented as friends…They are now and then mothers and daughters. But almost without exception they are shown in their relation to men. It was strange to think that all the great women of fiction were, until Jane Austen’s day, not only seen by the other sex, but seen only in relation to the other sex. And how small a part of a woman’s life is that.""Virginia WoolfBreakdown:With this goal reached, we will be able to completely produce the first five episodes of the show. We have two seasons completely planned out, and the following two seasons are in the works! This isn't a temporary thing. We are in this for the long haul.
 
 
While our goal may seem like a random number, it's anything but. We've meticulously calculated the costs of everything from equipment to food to reimbursements to those awesome IndieGoGo fees. 
Our entire budget for the first season greatly goes toward our cast and crew. Without a talented, passionate, and dedicated team, it's truly difficult to make something great. We have filmed footage for our trailers that are currently in editing. All images and videos are from rehearsing for and filming the trailers. We begin filming this summer, so we're going full force on this IndieGoGo campaign to be able to bring you quality content.Pilot:Gabrielle has just moved to The Bech. We open with her exiting her apartment unit in a clearly frustrated state. As she’s leaving, she runs into Tiana. After the initial surprise of now living in the same apartment after not seeing each other much since they both started college, Gabrielle is introduced to Tiana’s roommate, Eliza. The three spend time in Tiana’s apartment, and Gabrielle and Eliza quickly bond by finding a shared interest in crazy Tiana stories. They each share a story before the scene changes as Gabrielle explains the tensions with her roommate. Danielle opens her front door in the opening of the scene. Gabrielle introduces herself as Danielle’s new roommate. Danielle is studying at the kitchen table, and Gabrielle enters the apartment with a box. The two women discuss decorating the main areas of the apartment. They come to an awkward agreement. Before Gabrielle leaves her apartment in a huff, she and Danielle get into an argument over use of the shared space. Danielle insists she can’t do any work if she can see Gabrielle.Tiana and Eliza give Gabrielle fake, unhelpful advice - ranging from “cutting the bitch” to “seducing her.” Their fun ends when Tiana has to go to her shift at the front desk. Theme song: Walk away or see it through.Pick what do I have to lose.My whole world is turnin'.Bridges burnin'.It's time for my debut.First Five Episodes:""A Funny Thing, Luck ""Gabrielle moves into her new apartment and  is introduced and reintroduced to some of the residents of The Bech.""My Friend is Gay""Leia is having a difficult time adjusting and meets Tiana, who tells her that she has a lesbian friend that may be able to help her. ""I See What You Mean"" Leia mistakes Eliza for Gabrielle. Danielle finds out that her little sister will be coming to visit.""It’s Not Awkward if You Laugh"" Leia discovers the mistake she made over Eliza’s identity, and Gabrielle finds it amusing.""Is it Prejudice or Personal?""Tensions between Gabrielle and Danielle become obvious to more of The Bech friend group while they discuss different topics of diversity.Characters:GABRIELLE SANCHEZ is a second-year English student, feminine lesbian, and of Latin heritage. After being diagnosed with an Autism Spectrum Disorder in her first year of university, she underwent major changes in life and is now in a leadership role. More often than not, she does not realize someone is flirting with her until a friend points it out or she has someone’s tongue on her ear. She has three years to figure something out before student loans and real life begin - all while living with her near polar opposite.
LOIS ENTIN is in her third year of her communications degree. Determined to not let her depressive disorder be the leading factor in her life, she finds strength in helping animals. Growing up, she dated people of various genders, but could never find an identity she felt comfortable enough to claim. Lois cares more about being her best self than putting herself into a category. 
ALICE BETTON is cisgender and a third-year English and Theater double major who dreams of acting at the Shakespeare Globe Theatre. She is exceptionally outgoing and amicable, and is always convincing her roommates to throw parties. When she’s  not in party mode, she is in the mother role to the others. 
DANIELLE THOMAS, a white woman, is a third-year physics student from England. She’s studious, blunt, focused, and impatient. Her idea of fun is watching a documentary with a glass of red wine, and she doesn’t read anything with a plot. As a surrogate to family, she has become close to the professor for whom she is a TA, and she has not seen her real family since her first winter break in America. Coming from a background of nobility, she considers herself far too focused on her studies to worry about judging people or taking notice of the variety of identities that live around her. 
TIANA WILLIAMS is a second-year student and a straight, black woman studying biology on a pre-med track.  She’s full of qualities that are not generally seen together: intelligent, fun-loving, driven, heavy drinker, fiercely loyal friend, man-crazed, and studious. When in social settings, she lacks discretion with personal matters, often times sharing personal stories in great detail. While she’s always worked exceedingly hard in school, Tiana now has med-school applications on the horizon amongst all of her responsibilities at The Bech, but she sometimes can’t stop thinking about sex.
ELIZA SIMMONS, a woman of color, is a straight, first-year student studying student affairs. Her love for alcohol is rivaled only by her love for food. 
LEIA CORINTH, a bisexual woman, is a first-year Radio-Television-Film student from Alaska with two dads. 
SAMMIE SMITH is a more masculinely-dressed lesbian, third-year history major, and student athlete that was outed during an incident with another team. 
ALEXANDER McALLEN, a gay third-year journalism student, is on the football team with a full ride that sees his sexuality as merely a small part of who he is.
JORDAN TAMLIN is Alice's cousin and a transgender woman studying engineering, who enjoys joking about the odds of her and her three roommates being women loving women.
JAKE WATERS is an aromantic sophomore, studying astrophysics. Along with a budding friendship with Danielle, he has connections to several other characters. 
RENEE THOMAS, Danielle’s little sister, is in her senior year of high school. Her quick wit and sarcastic sense of humor make her stand out from her sister. 
LANE RAY is pansexual and a fourth-year history major. His goofy personality is accompanied by a love for comics, sci-fi, and superheroes.
KATIE GOMEZ, a second-year business student, transfers to the school for the second semester. She keeps to herself, and everyone begins to wonder many things about her.

I intentionally pulled together people directly from the fitness world to bring an element of authenticity, but also to show that there are SO MANY CREATIVES who work in fitness busting their butts every single day and working multiple jobs to pursue their dreams. It’s crazy how many actors, writers, producers, etc. consume the fitness industry, and I couldn’t be more grateful to be surrounded by them all. Bringing them onto this project has been amazing, not just because they’re talented, but also because they truly believe in what we’re creating and want to showcase this unique world we live in.

I was molded into the person I am today by my experience as a professional athlete. It gave me perspective, stories and fueled many of my creative endeavors. I’ve always dreamed of the day I would get to combine my careers and passions… and now, here we are!It’s also still frustratingly rare to see genuinely athletic and physically strong women with real muscle definition on screen. Wake up faster people, strength is attractive, attainable, and admirable—we need more of it! Showing these types of women in my show has been, and will continue to be, a significant component. Let's be real, badass women dominate the fitness scene, and it’s time we all knew about it.  WHO'S BEHIND THE PROJECT?Your contribution to this project will not only make my dream a reality, but also support a team of 20+ wonderful and talented people who’ve donated so much of their time and sweat into putting this quirky little project on screen. I intentionally pulled together people directly from the fitness world to bring an element of authenticity, but also to show that there are SO MANY CREATIVES who work in fitness busting their butts every single day and working multiple jobs to pursue their dreams. It’s crazy how many actors, writers, producers, etc. consume the fitness industry, and I couldn’t be more grateful to be surrounded by them all. Bringing them onto this project has been amazing, not just because they’re talented, but also because they truly believe in what we’re creating and want to showcase this unique world we live in. Since we are all so passionate about fitness and our LA niche, we plan to use this show to promote and shed light on this hardworking, thriving community.Olivier L. Gagnon (Director/Editor), THE CREW + A GOAT, Jacob Hellinga (Cinematographer)HOW WILL DONATIONS HELP?Every dollar donated will go towards paying for the crew, equipment, post-production, marketing, and more for the next two episodes and our eventual show launch! We've already shot three episodes that are currently being crafted in post-production and plan to keep the momentum going. Making scripted content takes a lot of work, a lot of time, and a lot of money. Even though these are short episodes, behind each one is months of hard work by multiple people. With your help we can give so many young, deserving people an opportunity to continue honing their craft, build their reels, strengthen their resumes; and have a damn good time while doing it.SO NOW WHAT?Watch the teaser above, donate if you feel inclined, follow our social media accounts, SHARE, SHARE, SHARE, and walk away knowing you helped further some artists’ careers and put smiles on many faces. Oh, and not to mention, you’ll snag some dope perks along the way (party invite, workout classes, swag bag & more... be sure to check them out on this page)! So thank you from the bottom of our hearts, we're blessed to have you on this journey with us!All love & sweat,Meagan FulpsFOLLOW ALONG: INSTAGRAM, YOUTUBE, FACEBOOK",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Christina Gray and I am a graduate student at Baylor University. In the summer of 2016, God confirmed my calling to combine my talents in filmmaking with my love for children. Now, I have the amazing opportunity to make my own kids video curriculum for my thesis project at Baylor. But I need your help in bringing together the team and the resources to make it all happen!</p>
<p>The cool thing about this project is that it includes a ton of research about how children respond to different storytelling methods. Throughout this process, I will observe how kids understand information from two videos, one of which I will make. My film will include the Gospel message, and I hope that it will plant seeds of faith in the hearts of the kids who watch it. Thank you for your financial help, as well as your prayers! Please pray that hearts are changed throughout this process!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to make this project possible, I need $1500! This budget will be divided over several categories including props, food, and cast/crew travel.</p>
<ul>
<li>Crew 12%</li>
<li>Cast 24%</li>
<li>On-Set Expenses 29%</li>
<li>Other Expenses 35%</li>
</ul>
<p>Take a look at the perks to see what each package offers! You can choose a perk or type in a custom donation amount by clicking the pink ""Back It"" button!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The biggest impact of this project is the lives that it will touch on set and in the data collection process. God has paved the way for this project to reach a huge amount of children. The episode used for testing is all about God's transforming love found in the story of Saul becoming Paul. Children will also learn how God loves and wants to transform them too</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The major challenge is going to be how we film this project. Sometimes technology doesn't always work as we have hoped. However, I can guarantee that I am the BEST team that will do everything we can to make this project a success. I have full faith in each of them and their talents. When we all put our heads together in the planning process, we will troubleshoot these problems to prevent them from happening.</p>

<h3>The Back Story...</h3>
<p>I’m Kiki Haynes and I’m excited to film and star in my first self-produced project.</p>
<p>As I stated, I’m very passionate about the roles offered to black actresses and I decided to create this film to diversify my acting portfolio. Initially, the idea and motive was to showcase my talent and show levels &amp; layers I haven’t been fully able to do in the roles I’ve been cast in thus far. But then my motive transcended into a purpose much greater than just myself. There's a responsibility to our young black girls and rising aspiring actresses alike who need to see more projects with characters of color in roles founded in areas like computer science, chemical engineering, astronomy, biology and just being overall heros. </p>
<p>Just A Phase, written by my talented co-producer, Kent Faulcon, is near and dear to my heart because it is founded in all of the above.  My character is a scientist who has a stumbled-upon piece of world altering technology placed in her care to protect; I am depicting my brains vs relying on exploiting my looks or the physical attributes of my body. I hope to inspire young girls to see themselves in my character and take an interest in for S.T.E.M. (science, technology, engineering &amp; math) courses and excelling in those subjects the way black girl magic only can!</p>

<p><strong>The Long &amp; the Short of it is...</strong></p>
<p>• This is a science based film with a goal to bring a positive message to Hollywood that black female actresses are under-represented in technology and science-fiction projects.</p>
<p>• This film has been a year in the making </p>
<p>• This film is done by a crew of people with extensive Feature Film &amp; TV resumes who have all enthusiastically agreed to work on this small budgeted indie film because of how strongly they believe in &amp; support the cause.</p>
</div><div>
<p>• This film will be made in its entirety no matter how much money we collect from this crowd funding campaign as this is a necessary goal and a passion project. </p>
<p>• Our writer &amp; director is not only a filmmaker, he is an incredibly acclaimed actor with a remarkable resume. He too joined forces with me to genuinely support my voice as a black actress. </p>
<p>• This is NOT just a film, its a statement!</p>

<p>Hi there, I'm <strong>KENT FAULCON</strong>, actor-writer-director, who you may recognize from such memorable films like “Selma,” “War of the Worlds,” “Men in Black,” and “Die Hard: With A Vengeance<i>.</i>” On TV, I played Richard Ellington for six seasons as a series regular on OWN’s “For Better or Worse” and you might also recognize that I'm Principal ""Denzel Washington"" Green on ABC’s hit-series “Blackish.” (And yes I have seen ""Training Day"" in real life!)  I've been blessed to share the big and small screen playing opposite great talents ranging from Gabrielle Union on BET’s “Being Mary Jane” to Annette Bening in “American Beauty.” My passion for acting is equaled by my passion for writing and directing. I'm a story teller.  From directing projects like my first award-winning feature film “Sister’s Keeper,” to episodes of Amazon web series “Bougie Dilemma,” to the television series multi-cam sitcom“Mi Casa, Mi Casa” I strive to tell stories that feature and spotlight strong, 3-dimensional, full-voiced women characters.  I couldn't be more excited to bring the thrilling suspenseful story of Hanna Morse, JPL lab researcher and soon-to-be world protector to the screen. A new hero is on the verge of being born and I truly hope you will help us bring this extraordinary character to life.</p>
