<p><b>WTF IS THIS?</b></p>
<p>My name is Stephanie Vela Anderson
and my social life is on the internet. </p>
<p>At age twenty-nine, my former spouse,
three children, and I moved from rural West Texas to Austin. The first year I was here, I worked night
shifts at a hospice facility while perusing a master’s in
psychology…establishing new friendships and learning how to trust again was difficult. </p>
<p>A year and half later, I lost a childhood
friend to suicide and my grandmother the week after. I was also processing the
lost of a beloved professor, who took her life six years earlier.
And my ex-husband and I decided it was time to end our thirteen-year marriage. </p>
<p>Going through all these things at
once made me feel even more isolated and alone than I did in the small town I grew up and
spent my young adulthood in. So I let myself go, publicly on the internet
because I didn’t know what else to do. I didn’t know how to properly deal
with my life long struggles with depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideations. </p>
<p>I didn’t expect to gain a
following while searching for myself. I also didn’t expect that some of the strongest
bonds I would feel would be through social media. I have met a few of my
friends offline and I love them just as much as I love my family. They are my
family. And I want to show the world just how beautiful they are to me.  </p>
<p><b>What I need to get started</b></p>
<p>Another Mac Book</p>
<p>External Memory</p>
<p>SD Cards </p>
<p>Legal Shit</p>
<p>Funds for Travel</p>
<p>I plan on working odd jobs and
seeking sponsorships (to fill in the gaps) as I journey across the states and
aboard. It's going to take close to two years to meet and interview everyone
who wants to be a part of my documentary, Heart Light. </p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Most of the private conversations I
have had with my online friends were about mental illness and the condition the world is in. I want to capture honest and thought provoking dialogue, much like the ones I've experiences in messenger and Facebook groups. The internet is a part of our lives now...I would like to focus on how we can facilitate it to improve how we view ourselves and each other.</p>
<p>There are also a ton of
musicians, artists, authors, and other seriously awesome people I would love to
capture performing or just doing their thing. </p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Like I said this is my first
full-length film and I’ve decided to do the majority of the work on my own
while traveling. I’ve been filming and editing all of my work for three years
now…it’s what I love to do. I want to keep this intimate, real, and raw…it’s a reflection
of life so there aren’t any pressures on my part to keep it super professional.
The story will tell itself. </p>
<p>Most production companies will not
pick up a film that is in the middle of production (I don’t want one anyway) so
if I get to the point where I feel overwhelmed and need help, I will have to
find a way to hire a crew. However, there are plenty of people who are willing
to assist in anyway possible so this may end up being a huge group effort,
which is awesome because it will create community. </p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Sharing the link is one of the greatest things you could
do right now! If you know someone who may be interested in donating anything
on my list, that would be super fucking awesome! I’m doing
this right now because I don’t know what else to do with myself. Now, I can look
in the mirror and say, “You did it, bitch!”</p>
<p>I LOVE ALL OF YOU HAVE A GREAT DAY, WEEK, MONTH, YEAR,
LIFE!</p>
<p>I’LL BE KNOCKING ON YOUR DOORS REAL SOON! </p>

</div></div>","ONCE UPON A TIME......in a land far, far away called San Francisco, there lived Courtney & Dara. From Howard & Harvard Universities respectively, the ladies decided one dark & dreary December to create a web-series. A Millennial magazine show, if you will, called Next Big Thing with Courtney & Dara.                       The ladies thought it’d be dope if there was a show that features their random misadventures on the way to adulthood and introduces people of the interwebs on the come-up to their multi-talented friends who on the rise in TV, Film, Arts, & Cultural scenes across this work-in-progress kingdom of America. And yes, these friends slay dragons too.With that, Courtney & Dara set off to make the best possible show on their Cinderella salaries. And you know something? That’s just what they did...and it’s pretty damn good too. Moving onward and upward,  the ladies could use your help to make Next Big Thing with Courtney & Dara: Season 2 even bigger and even better.
What’s the Next Big Thing? 

The Next Big Thing is you. Yes, you read right: YOU. When are you gonna get it?! Courtney & Dara are about that Self-Esteem life. Millennials and people of color are killin’ it all across the country. And that deserves to be seen. Dammit, you’re something to see! 
No, TIME Magazine, your feature on our record-breaking levels of entitlement and self-involvement doesn’t count. Good lookin’ out though...
Next Big Thing is bringing you the issues that matter without depressing the everloving crap out of you. Season 1, we brought you discussions on Cosby, Love in SF, and Technology. Season 2, we’re diving into more topics that are relevant to you. More thought-provoking topics such as Mental “Illness” in the new millennium, the real effect of micro-aggressions, and Sex-Ed reform to include rape prevention techniques for girls and boys as a follow-up to our Cosby discussion.
                                     



“I’m here for a good time, not a long time…” - Drake  We’re also about that Fun life. It’s cray out there, and you need to let loose and have some fun. Let Courtney & Dara handle it. Season 2 is bring you even bigger adventures including segments following Courtney as she obtains her first medical marijuana card and Driving with Courtney & Dara where Courtney will try to convince Dara that traffic in San Francisco is not only ridiculous but unnecessary. Ok, Courtney may have a little road rage but who doesn’t, right? Buckle up with (and pray for) Dara to find out!




Next Big Thing is Fresh Meat You ever play a new song that you think your friends are gonna love and they’re all like “Dude, I heard this 6 months ago. You late.” Stick with Courtney & Dara and we assure this will never happen to you again. Our special guests are on the come-up just like you. Their talent is splashed across screens and stages on the regular. They also have cool interests even outside of their work as artists and entrepreneurs. You need to meet them. Stay tuned so you turn into that friend that’s always like “You late.”

Here are some other things to look forward to:
New Studio Space! Season 1 was filmed in the waiting room of Courtney’s mom’s dental office. You smell that entrepreneurial spirit?! Well, we’ve since been evicted (something about the rugs not being clean enough, we don’t know) but not before our guest Elons James White (of This Week in Blackness) offered us a space to call home at TWiB studios. Thanks Elon!
A special episode filmed in *cue Alicia Keys* NEW YOOOOOoOrK featuring guests based in and topics exclusive to the concrete jungle.
What happens if we don’t make our goal?



One monkey don’t stop no show. Should the funding goals not be reached, season 2 will continue into production. We’ll just have to tighten the purse strings a little. But that won’t be necessary, right guys? We’ll stop this crazy talk now.

Next Big Thing’s Impact

We are working our booties off to bring you a quality show that represents our young and diverse audience in the least non-stereotypical (see:boring and outdated and a little bit racist?) way possible.

    
Your donations are in safe hands. Courtney and Dara are doers. We plan our work, and work our plan.By the end of 2014, we had simply imagined a talk-show hosted by yours truly. Season 1 is up and available on YouTube. By the end of 2015, we will have completed production on 2 full seasons of our first television productions. Ever.

<div>First off thanks for checking out this particular Indiegogo campaign. I'm Jonathan Ockletree the director for this short film titled ""Default"". Default will be my third short film that I have directed. I also have recorded and directed quite a few music videos and commercials that has helped me navigate and understand the film language. </div>
<div>With ""Default"" I wanted to create something different that takes aim at the issue of student loans. There is over 1.2 trillion dollars in student loan debt at the current moment. The default rate is at 13.7 percent and we have over 9.8 billion dollars for outstanding student loans. I personally have student loans and understand the difficulty in paying those loans back. I wanted to create something that would entertain the younger generation that is entering into college while sparking the conversation about student loans. Simply having the conversation about student loans and the gravity of what you will have to pay after graduation might just get someone to rethink and check into alternative methods to pay for their college experience. </div>
<div>The amazing thing is your not just investing into an idea. This film has already been shot we just need help with duplication so we can send to film festivals, assistance with film festival fees, and promotional materials. The goal is to get to as many colleges as possible to promote this visual.

<p>Default needs to happen because higher education is a goal that all americans would love to attain and while the student loan default rates continue to increase we at least need to educate as many people as possible about the pro’s and cons of student loans, as well as alternative measures . This short film is entertainment and education wrapped all together. This is the future! While Default is an action/thriller it grabs you immediately and doesn’t let go. In todays times young high school and college students dont want to watch documentaries. They want to see something provocative and engaging. </p>
<p>Default will be something that can spark conversation and propose an alternative solution towards financing college tuition. Even if we only were to get just one college student to re-think the way they’re paying for their tuition and instead of pulling out that loan they apply for more grants and scholarships this film has done what it was intended to do. The student loan industry has over 1 trillion dollars in defaulted loans! There are over 37 million borrowers that have defaulted on their student loans. These are the facts and the students aren’t informed until it’s too late. </p>
<p>Let’s be the spark that has students realize that they really need to take into consideration their financial future while at the same time being entertaining. </p>

<br/>
<p>Jonathan started his discovery for the love of filmmaking early in his life at the age of 15. “I used to take my pops video camera and just document everything that was happening in my life at the time with me and my friends. It probably could have been its own movie if i had that mindset at the time but i would just rewind the tape and let people watch.” </p>
<p>Jonathan honed his skills in college attending Indiana University- Purdue University of indianapolis majoring in computer graphics following the 3d graphicals and spatial animation career track. While the school taught graphic design and 3d it really didn’t focus a lot on the art of filmmaking in a whole. </p>
<p> I wanted to completely immerse myself in filmmaking. I started watching movies then would watch with the directors commentary, reading books, watching youtube videos, just doing whatever I could to learn more information. I knew that after a while I couldn’t just keep reading it was time to make a move” </p>
<p>Jonathan landed an internship helping out a local funded independent film with a grueling 30 day shoot. More than that actually since he helped with pre-production. </p>
<p>“ I saw them create an amazing project and they gave me some cool tips and pointers. After working that film set I found out what it really takes to get a movie shot and finished, from pre-production up to the editing.” </p>
<p>Enlightend Jonathan created “JTREE PRODUCTIONS” and went on to film 2 short films, work numerous commercials and music videos. “Default” will be his third short film project.</p>
<p>“Default holds a special spot in my heart because it’s a message to the younger generation entering college, that now is the most important time in your life and everything starts from this moment on. I wish somebody would have showed something like this to me when i was entering. That way i would at least be aware.  Student loans are a topic that needs to be adressed, seriously, before you sign them enrollment papers. I’m here to just spread a little knowledge about it!” </p>

Even if we only were to get just one college student to re-think the way they’re paying for their tuition and instead of pulling out that loan they apply for more grants and scholarships this film has done what it was intended to do. The student loan industry has over 1 trillion dollars in defaulted loans! There are over 37 million borrowers that have defaulted on their student loans. These are the facts and the students aren’t informed until it’s too late. 
Let’s be the spark that has students realize that they really need to take into consideration their financial future while at the same time being entertaining. 


If we could get just one child to take a deeper look into their financial future and look at other alternatives to paying for college then we have completed our jobs. 
    


    

DIRECTOR/WRITER: JONATHAN OCKLETREE



Jonathan started his discovery for the love of filmmaking early in his life at the age of 15. “I used to take my pops video camera and just document everything that was happening in my life at the time with me and my friends. It probably could have been its own movie if i had that mindset at the time but i would just rewind the tape and let people watch.” 
Jonathan honed his skills in college attending Indiana University- Purdue University of indianapolis majoring in computer graphics following the 3d graphicals and spatial animation career track. While the school taught graphic design and 3d it really didn’t focus a lot on the art of filmmaking in a whole. 
 I wanted to completely immerse myself in filmmaking. I started watching movies then would watch with the directors commentary, reading books, watching youtube videos, just doing whatever I could to learn more information. I knew that after a while I couldn’t just keep reading it was time to make a move” 
Jonathan landed an internship helping out a local funded independent film with a grueling 30 day shoot. More than that actually since he helped with pre-production. 
“ I saw them create an amazing project and they gave me some cool tips and pointers. After working that film set I found out what it really takes to get a movie shot and finished, from pre-production up to the editing.” 
Enlightend Jonathan created “JTREE PRODUCTIONS” and went on to film 2 short films, work numerous commercials and music videos. “Default” will be his third short film project.
“Default holds a special spot in my heart because it’s a message to the younger generation entering college, that now is the most important time in your life and everything starts from this moment on. I wish somebody would have showed something like this to me when i was entering. That way i would at least be aware.  Student loans are a topic that needs to be adressed, seriously, before you sign them enrollment papers. I’m here to just spread a little knowledge about it!” 
PRODUCER: NORMAN HOOKS



Through focus, drive and amazing business smarts Norman Hooks is one of the best at completing projects, fueling ideas, and making sure people are on task.

Young and in charge of himself Norman began a career in rap music that opened many doors as well as his eyes. Seeing the whole scope of the entertainment industry Norman dropped rap and started a successful magazine company named Now and latr magazine. 
In 2010 Norman ran into Jonathan Ockletree through mutual friends and began helping out and doing producer work on set.

<h3>Why Are We So Passionate About This Film? </h3>
<div>An estimated 50 percent of us will be diagnosed with cancer in our lifetimes, and survival rates have not significantly changed since Richard Nixon declared war on cancer in 1971. At the same time, we're losing our rainforests at an alarming rate. Why is this important? Approximately 25 percent of the active ingredients in cancer drugs are found only in the Amazon, yet less than 10 percent of its plants have been studied for their medicinal properties. The Amazon is a veritable pharmacopeia, but we need to act fast to keep it that way. Experts estimate that at the current rate of destruction, the last remaining rainforests will be consumed in less than 40 years. As the Amazon rainforest disappears, so do many potential cures.  (1)</div>

Currently it is just about up and running at a very basic level but I have big plans to turn it into a business but also a place where under privileged school children can come for a much needed break in their school holidays.    What We Need & What You Get  I am looking for £10,000. Now this is quite a considerable amount of money but this will allow me to equip the guest house with everything it needs to be a successful business from beds, fridges, kitchen equipment, transportation, tables, bedding etc. etc.
For the business to be able to offer the summer breaks to those in need it needs to operate as a successful profit making business for certain months of the year to enable this to happen.  By donating to my fund you will be able to come and stay at the guest house free of charge dependant upon the size of your contribution. If I do not reach my entire goal then I will scale the operation back to a level I can afford but the most important thing is creating a sustainable business that is able to help those most in need.    The Impact The difference your donation will make is that it will allow a child or many children the opportunity to come to the island of Koh Lanta and forget about hardship for a short while, the plan is to make the holiday completely free of charge, including pick up from the main land :  Explain why your project is valuable to the contributor and to the world. Point out your successful track record with projects like this (if you have one). Make it real for people and build trust.    Risks & Challenges  With every project and undertaking in life there is a risk, but I have signed a 25 year lease on the property so I am not going anywhere for a long long time, I am Thai so understand the way my beautiful country works and really believe now is the time to start making a difference where I can.  I have various qualities, I am honest, kind, compassionate, a native Thai speaker and a fluent English speaker. . As each problem arises in the project I will try my all to overcome it, this is not just a project to help others this business is my income so everything is on the line for me to make this work..",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p></p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
</div></div>","The Last Paupers is a fictional autobiographical dark comedy following the life of a failing, misanthropic writer and his son who actually does most of the writing. The Last Paupers eschews the typical sit-com structure, offering you painfully funny stories as seen through the eyes of a jaded cynic, who happens be a child, and his equally cynical but far less mature father. Think The Odd Couple by way of Bad Santa with a protagonist who desperately wants to be Nick Hornsby.


There is something about a grownup asking other grownups for money that makes everyone involved feel like at any moment they might evacuate their respective colons. If it’s kids and teenagers, no worries, here’s my wallet, but if Uncle Dennis asks? Hide the good silver kids, I think he’s on the powder (it was actually gambling, Dennis loved those ponies.) It’s so uncomfortable that I have carefully constructed this word cushion, this verbal “bush” so that we can, as the old timers say “beat around it.” Alas though, the beating must end…So that we can segue into a vague metaphor meant to further dampen the imagined shame. So. The awkward moment where we have the talk. I know you told us not to get in bed with that Liberal Arts degree, you said it wasn’t stable, it probably wasn’t going to work out. Mostly you were right, it’s been a crazy relationship, but here’s the deal, we’re pregnant now. And we’ve decided to keep the baby. Only it’s not really a “baby” baby, it’s a show... And we thought maybe you would want to visit, or I dunno, child support? Damn, that metaphor fell apart fast.

For those of you who have been following the development of The Last Paupers since last December you know how much work and energy the real life Paupers have poured into the project. The show officially moved out of pre-production and into production three months ago and since then we have focused on creating the absolute best show we can. We have been writing and work-shopping these characters for so long we feel like they are a part of our family, and we can’t wait to introduce all of you to Nick, Noah, Alfie and the rest of the Paupers. 


We are at the point now where production costs have moved from eating away at our personal accounts to devouring them ferociously. As we move through the process of getting our official website up, paying for domains, hosts, and developers, the cost are simply moving past the point where we can afford to pay for it and work on it at the pace we need to. 



Trust me, if there are financial corners we can cut without sacrificing the quality of the show, we are taking them. We've spent weekends making our own camera rigs and setups so we wouldn’t have to buy them. We build all of our own props and costumes. 
Heck, one of us even made one of the actors! We love this show, and we know you will too. We are asking for help to offset some of the costs of completing production and getting the website up. You will be able to see the results of your investment in us with continued progress reports directly from the set as well as active forums on the site itself. In fact, if we meet our funding goal I can say with confidence we will have the website up and running within two weeks. You will know that you made that happen, you created that. The site will be your one top shop for access to The Last Pauper’s podcast, set pics, social media, blog posts and by the end of this year, the actual show! 


You folks are the reason we are doing this, well that and we’re all a bit crazy, but as Kerouac said “the only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars.”  Thanks for being mad with us, now it’s time to burn, burn, burn,

Founding for the people in Cuba, a photo exhibition in Stockholm, a coffee table book and for a second, more in depth, photo trip to Cuba.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p style=""text-align: left;""><i>We were utterly intoxicated with one another…</i></p><p></p><p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Still Water is an intimate drama that explores the relationship between lovers who are utterly intoxicated with one another but never on the same page. Our female antagonist is in severe denial about their shared alcohol dependancy and constantly pulls her boyfriend down with her so that she will not feel so alone. Our script embraces how self awareness and destruction collide within a painful and vibrant narrative. Each moment explores human connection in the most naked and volatile sense. Our themes are self conflict, intoxication, and dysfunctional love. Our script calls for unconventional albeit recognizable storytelling techniques. Montage narrated by dialogue and design that complements the content through contrast. Our non-linear timeline will allow us to pack immense meaning into a fifteen minute experience. The acting, as always, will be the deciding factor as to how the film will be received and how our story will affect those who are watching.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">AESTHETIC</b></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The look of our film takes inspiration from THE TREE OF LIFE as directed by Terrence Malick and HER as directed by Spike Jonze. Picture slightly faded colours with bright and vibrant backgrounds all in widescreen to completely absorb both the objects and environment of our world. There will be a glamorous element to the lighting which will juxtapose the drama of our story. The cinematography will touch on implications of the sublime without falling into them, staying relative to love and trust between humans. This look will be achieved through the use of white, natural lighting and contrasted subjects to maintain depth of environment.</p><p></p><p><b>PERFORMANCES</b></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The complexity of our story can only be told through the nuances of both the dialogue and the characters. The performances will be evocative and subtle with a focus on body language over spoken word and symbolism over explicit nature. The name of the game is not what is said but what is left unsaid. Our story addresses contemporary issues of the subconscious and the plague of self that mars every single person. Our script tackles the seeming inability to commit to the best version of oneself. The characters are accessible because they project a side of self that everyone can relate to. Motivation for our actors comes from the inner tension and struggle between the person they want to be, the person they really are and who others see them as.</p><p></p><p><b>SOUND DESIGN</b></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The sound design in our film will go as far as possible before crossing into experimental. Because of our non-linear storyline, sound will cue certain places we have been before and will become an adhesive to the overall narrative. The focus will stay on emersion into the location with clear and powerful dialogue. The contemporary score will provide a backbone for the dramatic tone but stay away from distraction or blatant emotional influence. Sound and music will both be minimalist in nature, simply adding depth to the visuals and story.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p><b>A NOTE FROM OUR SCREENWRITER</b></p><p><i>I am fascinated by personal dependency and the inability to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy affection. When people walk away from this film, I hope our story will inspire them to feel things more deeply in the same way that sobriety forces me to experience emotion. I want to encourage our audience to live with those feelings on the surface and embrace their own inner struggle as an unexpected source of empowerment.</i></p><p>- <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/still-water-the-short-film/edit/www.cjmcgillivray.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CJ McGillivray</a></p><p><b>EXPENSES</b></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The intimate nature of our script demands professionalism, precision and outstanding quality. This means having all the resources we need to turn our concept into something tangible. Your financial support will go directly toward the following expenses:</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">PRODUCTION DESIGN: Our visual design requires insight and precision through the selection of vibrant colours and complimentary textures. Balance will help create a noninvasive visual landscape and subtle architecture that will support the drama unfolding on screen</span></li></ul><ul><li style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">COSTUME DESIGN: Our costume design will contribute toward the appearance of each character with subtle but distinct intent. Personalities become entangled with increased emotional dependancy: the emotional mirroring results in our ensemble dressing more and more similar through the progression of time.</span></li></ul><ul><li style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">HAIR AND MAKE UP: Our characters will look occasionally dishevelled throughout the film. The actors will portray a dramatic age range of five years within the context of our fifteen minute film. Hair and make up will assist our actors in portraying a younger or more mature look depending on where they are in the progression of the film.</span></li></ul><ul><li style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">EQUIPMENT RENTALS: Our production crew need the proper resources and equipment in order to create something visually stunning and poignant. That means proper lighting equipment and various camera lenses to capture our story with beautiful precision.</span></li></ul><ul><li style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">CATERING: Our cast and crew are donating their time and efforts in order to make this story happen. We want to show our immense gratitude and appreciation by providing healthy, quality meals that can sustain our team through four long days of filming.</span></li></ul><ul><li style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">TRANSPORTATION: Our various locations make up an integral story element within the context of our film. Effective transportation and planning will keep us effective and efficient when moving from one location to another over the course of our production schedule.</span></li></ul><ul><li style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">DISTRIBUTION: Our story can only resonate with audience members provided we are able to reach them. Our marketing and distribution expenses will include but are not limited to online distribution, film festival submission costs, poster printing and theatre rental costs for our upcoming film premiere.</span></li></ul><ul><li style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">PUBLICITY: Our film needs to garner excitement and support throughout the process so we can engage a broad audience with the full impact of our story. Our publicity expenses will include professional behind the scenes photography, poster design, media connections and online exposure through resources such as The International Movie Database.</span></li></ul><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>CHALLENGES</b></p>
<p>Our film has a complex narrative that exposes the raw nature of both recovery and dependency. How can we do this without placing judgement? Our film is not a public service announcement. One of our primary challenges was discovering how to explore those intimate themes through compassion and personal insight. Our script openly explores how substance abuse can undoubtedly empower or weaken our ability to connect with one other. The characters represent opposing mental states and shared dependency: <b>emotional dependency</b>, <b>romantic dependency </b>and <b>substance</b> <b>dependency</b>. Our script opposes the traditional black and white narrative, finding nuance and compassion in each moment. Through our efforts we will overcome any challenging preconceived notions and perceptions about both dependency and recovery.</p>

Our female antagonist is in severe denial about their shared alcohol dependancy and constantly pulls her boyfriend down with her so that she will not feel so alone. Our script embraces how self awareness and destruction collide within a painful and vibrant narrative. Each moment explores human connection in the most naked and volatile sense. Our themes are self conflict, intoxication, and dysfunctional love. Our script calls for unconventional albeit recognizable storytelling techniques. Montage narrated by dialogue and design that complements the content through contrast. Our non-linear timeline will allow us to pack immense meaning into a fifteen minute experience. The acting, as always, will be the deciding factor as to how the film will be received and how our story will affect those who are watching.AESTHETICThe look of our film takes inspiration from THE TREE OF LIFE as directed by Terrence Malick and HER as directed by Spike Jonze. Picture slightly faded colours with bright and vibrant backgrounds all in widescreen to completely absorb both the objects and environment of our world. There will be a glamorous element to the lighting which will juxtapose the drama of our story. The cinematography will touch on implications of the sublime without falling into them, staying relative to love and trust between humans. This look will be achieved through the use of white, natural lighting and contrasted subjects to maintain depth of environment.PERFORMANCESThe complexity of our story can only be told through the nuances of both the dialogue and the characters. The performances will be evocative and subtle with a focus on body language over spoken word and symbolism over explicit nature. The name of the game is not what is said but what is left unsaid. Our story addresses contemporary issues of the subconscious and the plague of self that mars every single person. Our script tackles the seeming inability to commit to the best version of oneself. The characters are accessible because they project a side of self that everyone can relate to. Motivation for our actors comes from the inner tension and struggle between the person they want to be, the person they really are and who others see them as.SOUND DESIGNThe sound design in our film will go as far as possible before crossing into experimental. Because of our non-linear storyline, sound will cue certain places we have been before and will become an adhesive to the overall narrative. The focus will stay on emersion into the location with clear and powerful dialogue. The contemporary score will provide a backbone for the dramatic tone but stay away from distraction or blatant emotional influence. Sound and music will both be minimalist in nature, simply adding depth to the visuals and story.A NOTE FROM OUR SCREENWRITERI am fascinated by personal dependency and the inability to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy affection. When people walk away from this film, I hope our story will inspire them to feel things more deeply in the same way that sobriety forces me to experience emotion. I want to encourage our audience to live with those feelings on the surface and embrace their own inner struggle as an unexpected source of empowerment.- CJ McGillivrayEXPENSESThe intimate nature of our script demands professionalism, precision and outstanding quality. This means having all the resources we need to turn our concept into something tangible. Your financial support will go directly toward the following expenses:PRODUCTION DESIGN: Our visual design requires insight and precision through the selection of vibrant colours and complimentary textures. Balance will help create a noninvasive visual landscape and subtle architecture that will support the drama unfolding on screenCOSTUME DESIGN: Our costume design will contribute toward the appearance of each character with subtle but distinct intent. Personalities become entangled with increased emotional dependancy: the emotional mirroring results in our ensemble dressing more and more similar through the progression of time.HAIR AND MAKE UP: Our characters will look occasionally dishevelled throughout the film. The actors will portray a dramatic age range of five years within the context of our fifteen minute film. Hair and make up will assist our actors in portraying a younger or more mature look depending on where they are in the progression of the film.EQUIPMENT RENTALS: Our production crew need the proper resources and equipment in order to create something visually stunning and poignant. That means proper lighting equipment and various camera lenses to capture our story with beautiful precision.CATERING: Our cast and crew are donating their time and efforts in order to make this story happen. We want to show our immense gratitude and appreciation by providing healthy, quality meals that can sustain our team through four long days of filming.TRANSPORTATION: Our various locations make up an integral story element within the context of our film. Effective transportation and planning will keep us effective and efficient when moving from one location to another over the course of our production schedule.DISTRIBUTION: Our story can only resonate with audience members provided we are able to reach them. Our marketing and distribution expenses will include but are not limited to online distribution, film festival submission costs, poster printing and theatre rental costs for our upcoming film premiere.PUBLICITY: Our film needs to garner excitement and support throughout the process so we can engage a broad audience with the full impact of our story. Our publicity expenses will include professional behind the scenes photography, poster design, media connections and online exposure through resources such as The International Movie Database.


CHALLENGES
Our film has a complex narrative that exposes the raw nature of both recovery and dependency. How can we do this without placing judgement? Our film is not a public service announcement. One of our primary challenges was discovering how to explore those intimate themes through compassion and personal insight. Our script openly explores how substance abuse can undoubtedly empower or weaken our ability to connect with one other. The characters represent opposing mental states and shared dependency: emotional dependency, romantic dependency and substance dependency. Our script opposes the traditional black and white narrative, finding nuance and compassion in each moment. Through our efforts we will overcome any challenging preconceived notions and perceptions about both dependency and recovery.

Barbarita (Last Name) or best known as Barbarita Tortilla is a 40 years
old woman who was born in Poncitlan, Jalisco. She was abused by her 
husband, and once miscarried a baby because he hit her while she was 
pregnant. However, Barbarita had the strength to put an end to the destructive 
relationship. What strike us the most was realizing that Barbarita was not a rare 
case. Even though she was strong enough to have the “pantalones” to 
overcome the situation, there are still millions of women that are going through 
the same circumstance, who are immersed in this degrading reality and need 
the inspiration of Barbarita.

cette relation destructrice. 
Ce qui nous a le plus frappée a été de réaliser que Barbarita n’est pas un cas rare. 
Elle a eu la chance d'avoir les ""cojones"" de briser ce tabou, mais il existe des 
millions de femmes qui vivent dans la même situation et NOUS (oui je parle vous 
aussi!) devons leur donner le soutien et les ""cojones"" dont elles ont besoin
pour mettre fin à ce fléau.


¿Why we choose Barbarita Tortilla? 

You will fall in love with her charming-warrior spirit and her contagious 
smile, because she sets an example and inspires us to be strong and stay true 
to our morals.

Por que nos enamoramos de su carisma y espíritu guerrero. Ella es el perfecto 
ejemplo que las mujeres necesitan para romper sus miedos y salir adelante. 

 

Vous tomberez sous le charme de son esprit  guerrier et son sourire contagieux, 
parce qu'elle montre l'exemple et nous inspire en restant forte et fidèle à ses 
moeurs.





¿Why those that matter, how can this issue affect you directly?

Violence against women is a social issue that occurs around the world 
regardless of economic status, race or age, 3 out of 5 women in Mexico have 
suffered or are suffering from a form of abuse, meaning that you might know 
someone who is going through this.

La violencia hacia las mujeres es un problema que no respeta estatus económico, ni 
nacionalidad. En Mexico, 2 de cada 3 mujeres han sufrido o están sufriendo algún 
tipo de violencia. Esto significa que tu conoces a alguna de estas victimas, solo que 
quizás no lo sabias. Imagina que puede ser tu compañera, tu amiga, tu hermana, tu 
novia o tu mama.

 La violence faite aux femmes est un problème social qui touche les femmes du
 monde entier peu importe leur statut économique, l'éthnie ou l'âge. 3 femmes sur
 5 au Mexico en ont souffert ou en souffrent, ce qui veut dire que vous en 
connaissez sûrement une dans votre entourage.


¿How funds will be used?



With your donations, we will cover the expenses of the short film “Barbarita Tortilla” which will help us spread the message of hope for the women of the world. The money raised will cover:
1) Providing food (A full meal, snacks, water), transportation (equipment van, gasoline, etc.
2) Renting equipment (lighting, sound, specialty gear), props, wardrobe, and set design.


3) Cast/crew per diem.
4) Post-production.
5) Festivals
Every cent that you donate will contribute to the goal, which is put an end to this issue. We understand that not everyone can donate, but you can really help us by spreading the word and reposting this link! Even if we do not reach the goal, we will move the entire world if necessary to make this project happen, and make the amazing story of Barbarita Tortilla known! The money raised will go into our film’s bank account and we will continue to work until we reach our goal. From the bottom of our hearts, 
Thank you !
El gran problema es que la mayoria de las victimas creen que merecen ser tratadas de esa manera o creen que es algo normal. La solucion mas eficaz para este problema es la educacion ¿y que mejor manera de enseñar, que a travez del cine? Tenemos que enseñarles a nuestras mujeres que ser golpeadas y maltratadas no es algo que nadie merezca o deba tolerar. 
Necesitamos tu ayuda para cubrir todos los gastos de producción del cortometraje. 
El dinero será utilizado de la siguiente manera:
1. Comida para todo el equipo de producción. (Agua, Snacks, comida entera)
2. Transporte para el equipo de producción. (Gasolina, Equipo Técnico, etc.)
3. Cast/crew per diem.
4. Post-Producción (Edición, Diseño de Sonido, Corrección de color)
5. Festivales 
Cada centavo que se done contribuirá a la causa, que es poner un alto a la violencia contra la mujer. Nosotras entendemos que no todo el mundo esta en la 
posibilidad de donar. Por eso, compartiendo el link de la campaña en diferentes plataformas sociales puede hacer la diferencia. 

Avec vos dons, nous allons couvrir les frais du court-métrage ""Barbarita Tortilla"" et diffuser le message d'un avenir meilleur pour les femmes du monde entier. L'argent récolté couvrira les frais suivants :
1) Fournir de la nourriture (repas complet, collations, eau...) à l'équipe
2) location de l'équipement (lumière, sons, caméra, accessoires etc)
3) Rémunération de l'équipe 
4) Post production
5) Inscription aux festivals
Chaque centime que vous donnerez contribuera à mettre un terme à ce problème dans le long terme. Nous comprenons que tout le monde ne peut pas contribuer financièrement à ce projet, mais vous pouvez nous aider en diffusant ce lien!
Même si nous ne parvenons pas à atteindre notre but, nous allons remuer ciel et terre pour rendre ce projet possible et faire connaître l'histoire incroyable de Barbarita Tortilla !
Du fond du cœur, nous vous remercions!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

But let's go back to the beginning...  This trailer is a mashup of scenes from the original WIT pilot and some other scenes that were shot only to promote the series.

After a little heartache and a lot of determination we put together a  show from a comedy script that was actually for an episode later in the series...

That brings us to the present... and why we want you to become part of the WIT  family.

Jennifer Martin is beautiful, educated abroad and classy, But when her social worker boyfriend falls for Rosaly, the gloves come off and Rosaly remembers her when she was just Jennifer Martinez, the school bully.


That's the ensemble cast so far with others to be added. But what a cast. Johanna Tolentino (Creed, El Pasaje, Lean on Me) pulls triple duty as lead actor, co-writer and executive producer; Brian is a veteran actor of HBO's hit, The Wire; Elaine Del Valle (Donnie Brasco, Brownsville Bred) and Jay Alvarez (Be Careful, The Sharks Will Eat You) are the creators of their own acclaimed off-Broadway shows.  Blanca Camacho (The Secret Life of Walter Mitty) was an original cast member of the Tony Award winning musical, In The Heights. The credits for the entire cast go on and on and we can't wait to show you what they can do. Here's how you can help.



   GET ""WIT"" IT! So far we have put together a number of short videos, getting as feeling for the unique characters and the storyline. Now we want to go deeper and shoot a series length pilot, as heartfelt as it is funny just like the families we love.
Donations will go towards paying and feeding our large cast, the crew, locations and post production including editing, color correction and music licensing. We expect to be able to shoot two 22 minute episodes with the amount you will help us raise. 



But we would never ask you to help us and get nothing in return, which is why we're offering WIT specific gifts to say thanks. These perks include an exclusive DVD including bonus footage and hilarious outtakes, an original script signed by the cast,  a premium soft t-shirt (below),


  Whatever it Takes exclusive t-shirt
RoRo's home cooked Puerto Rican dinner with the cast, big shot executive producer credit, and many more perks just for you.
And whatever donation you choose to give will be well spent since this campaign gives us the ability to put every dollar we raise to good use.   

 So here it is, your chance to support independent production; a funny engaging series that started as one person's passion and grew into a team of dedicated creators and performers .  
If you liked what you saw so far donate and help make the next step the biggest yet. Even if you can't contribute you can still help. Spread the word now on Twitter, Facebook, and all your social media platforms.

at VCU, partnered with the James River Park System. This class is a first-year
seminar, and I use service projects as a way to get students out of the classroom into the community. In this case, we go to the park (all around, up and down) to
think, talk, work, reflect on civic responsibility, pro-action, wild spaces in urban places, discovery, utility - you name it. <br/><br/>During the year we work in the park and
provide whatever help is needed. Over the course of the class, we have have installed
markers, painted miles of wood and metal, diverted trails or dug pits - even
caught a thief. It’s been a great experience;
I do have stories.
<p><br/></p><p>This is one of them:</p>
<p>A couple years ago, we pitched to
the park system the idea of a “Memorial Bike Rack” – a sculpted object which
also provides a utility. The bike rack honors those prisoners of war held on
Belle Isle during the Civil War, as well as provide a place to secure bikes. People stash their
bikes anywhere right now, because there just aren’t enough bike racks to handle
the traffic.</p>
<p>The shape is modeled on the
Sibley tents provided for the prisoners in the camp. It is conical; a one-and-a-half foot diameter center ring at the top is supported by eight long legs. Twelve feet tall and eighteen feet across at the base, these tents were
prominent features of the early prison camp. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435153272/tcysqp953upzswcf8ppo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>As the Civil War raged, living
conditions on Belle Isle deteriorated. Tents degraded; shelter disappeared.
Exposure contributed to the deaths of thousands of prisoners. </p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435153322/igz2alauqxmbgswtzqba.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Ralph White, the Park Manager at
the time, really liked the idea, gave us the go-ahead, then retired. The
project had to pause until the new Park Manager, Nathan Burrell, was settled.  I kept the project as a part of my class during the
interim. A
park system with near a million active visitors a year and without a lot of bike
racks (let alone memorials to the Union soldiers kept in inhumane conditions)
seemed to need the project. I used the parts of the process of making this memorial bike rack as
avenues for experiential research and writing, composition and design. As we learned, the project progressed: figuring out how to make what, what
materials needed to be gotten, who to supply it, fabricate it, assemble it. 
<p>As we searched out all parts of
the creation and execution of a Memorial Bike Rack, we also explored
the larger Richmond community – this class is a first year seminar, so most of
the students hadn’t been in Richmond very long, some having been just in-country
for a few weeks. Working on the project,
students discovered there’s more to this city here - a lot more (a whole lot more) than what's just on campus. The
class went places we wouldn’t have otherwise.</p>
<p>The Belle Isle Memorial Bike Rack
was installed on Belle Isle December 6, 2014. The final part of installing the
piece was to coat it in some sort of black rubber paint, to disappear from
peripheral vision, but still it caught your eye. The day it got put in, people
started using it. After that, when I went to Belle Isle, I would see bikes at
it or kids on it.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435152726/tyqjdijczyd8pycc8idi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

<p>Four bike racks
will make the series – one to represent each year the prison camp operated on
Belle Isle (1862 to 1865). The first one will be a model of a Sibley tent,
twelve feet tall and eighteen feet wide at the base (the same as the
Memorial Bike Rack). Each bike rack after the first is successively more
“broken” or “degraded” – 1863 has a full kink, 1864 is a mess, 1865 folds in on
itself. In series, this illustrates the worsening conditions of the camp and of
the prisoners. The final iteration is the most recognizable as a bike rack: the
top center ring will have collapsed in to the point of being on the ground in
the center of the wide base offering many places along its legs to
secure a bike.</p>
<p>Each bike rack
will have a unique sign describing the real conditions by a real prisoner of
the camp for a particular year. Two additional signs – one at the Lee Bridge
walkway overlook and one at the Bike Skills park – will explain the series and list sponsors.</p><p><br/></p>

warehouse. The area of each rack in the series will be<span>  surveyed, and the path for moving the pieces
policed for impediments. Under the warehouse roof, the series will be laid out,
put together generally. Outside, the bases will be secured with concrete. The pieces
will then be finished, forms completed. The pieces are then moved from the
warehouse to location and secured to a base. At the conclusion of the
installation will be a dedication.</span></p>
<p>The fact that the Memorial Bike Rack was destroyed only makes this project stronger: foremost, some modifications (involving more

</h3> <p></p>In the near future, an unexplained phenomenon has progressively given the majority of the world's population telepathic abilities. While many herald this as a new age of human evolution and culture, for those who do not have this gift, this new world is a dark place. The non-telepathic have become the new under-class, with new laws and social change making them less than human.<br/><br/>Alina is a young woman who has not developed telepathic abilities. Under the new 'Reclamation' laws, Alina is case managed by a telepathic social worker named Ash. Through their interview, we learn Alina's story and the discrimination she has faced through her life.<br/><br/>In this piece, we examine the nature of discrimination. How those in power can justify their feelings of superiority and the social (and often legal) barriers that put up to keep others down. They believe they are doing the right thing, but discrimination is never right.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448315335/asx4qgazhqc64rgl2khr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</div></div>","About the Film
 In the near future, an unexplained phenomenon has progressively given the majority of the world's population telepathic abilities. While many herald this as a new age of human evolution and culture, for those who do not have this gift, this new world is a dark place. The non-telepathic have become the new under-class, with new laws and social change making them less than human.Alina is a young woman who has not developed telepathic abilities. Under the new 'Reclamation' laws, Alina is case managed by a telepathic social worker named Ash. Through their interview, we learn Alina's story and the discrimination she has faced through her life.In this piece, we examine the nature of discrimination. How those in power can justify their feelings of superiority and the social (and often legal) barriers that put up to keep others down. They believe they are doing the right thing, but discrimination is never right.

<p>• One or more decently paying jobs</p>
<p>• A clean, sustainable, small-scale manufacturing </p>
<p>• Future projects constrained only by imagination!</p>
<p>I’m not looking to be the next bazillionaire or to save the planet. I’m just looking to create a sustainable business and a positive work experience for a few people in this rural area, including myself. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Ultimately, I’m taking this entire project off-grid and powering with solar.</span></p>
<p></p>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></h3>
<div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>At whatever level of funding, even if it’s less than my stated goal, I will use the investment toward creation of the M factory. If only minimal levels of investment are achieved, I may have to locally outsource the first run of reusable firework devices.</p>
<p>The shipping times shown are estimates, based on a moderate degree of success in funding. Shipping times may be longer if pledges exceed estimates. As the project develops, I’ll be clear about time frames. If the funding goals are surpassed in a huge way, there will be some impact on delivery times for later donors. Manufacturing will occur on a first come, first served basis.</p>
<p>I encourage the user to check local and mail order retailers for availability of black powder. Even without black powder, the M series firework devices are awesome sculptures with aesthetic attitude.</p>

You can find a limited quantity of M58 Six Packs or single M650h's for only $78.00 and free shipping within the continental United States.
Welcome to the world of the first aesthetic pyrotechnic: A sustainable ultra modern firework, milled from solid 416 stainless steel.


Short Summary
 
Fireworks were invented in China in the 7th century. Not much has changed about them, until now. Welcome to the world of the first aesthetic pyrotechnic: A sustainable ultra modern firework, milled from solid 416 stainless steel.



Elegantly simple in its design, the user fills the reusable firework with widely available black powder, inserts a fuse, gently packs the powder down with the included tamper, and it’s ready to make a big boom. After use, the firework is easily 





 cleaned, and it's even dishwasher safe! The M-series firework comes in two sizes: the M58 cracker and the M650 boom. 




What I Need 

The funding for this project will provide for the infrastructure that will enable this reusable firework and other future projects. Like the mC4d, the latest of the M 





Series firework line: A modern CNC machined  6061 aluminum container holding four M58f-crackers and a single tamper.

What You Get

You get a precision-machined sculpture that looks great year-round, just sitting on your desk or in your living room. On special occasions or just for fun, you can fill it with readily available, locally sourced black powder and it makes a very big boom.

At whatever level of funding, even if it’s less than my stated goal, I will use the investment toward creation of the M factory. If only minimal levels of investment are achieved, I may have to locally outsource the first run of reusable firework devices.
The shipping times shown are estimates, based on a moderate degree of success in funding. Shipping times may be longer if pledges exceed estimates. As the project develops, I’ll be clear about time frames. If the funding goals are surpassed in a huge way, there will be some impact on delivery times for later donors. Manufacturing will occur on a first come, first served basis.
I encourage the user to check local and mail order retailers for availability of black powder. Even without black powder, the M series firework devices are awesome sculptures with aesthetic attitude.

pictures above are a stark reminder of the atrocities of 911. There was not a
dry eye in our group when we posted these pictures. The mainstream media was
dictated not to show the events of 911 so the world would forget.

<p> We
think it is important to show the world right now, 15 years later, that
those who know better and know the truth have not forgotten the day a
piece of America was stolen from us all.  <br/></p>
<p> 
The trust in the U.S. government was gone forever. Along with Building 7,
the trust in our financial system was taken. Investigations were underway to
look into decades of securities fraud and thousands of micro-cap companies and brokers.  Just like all
other Americans that morning, these people just went to work, not knowing they
were part of a few people’s plan to murder and cover for profit. The evidence
plainly shows this. “Textbook” diagonal cutter charges were
implemented to cut the steel columns. The only part of
the building that remained intact, with no evidence of tampering, was
the five story atrium, which was wide open where explosives could not
be concealed or hidden away from view. Those pictures show, along with other
evidence, that columns were intentionally cut in the sub floors to  jamb
doorways just before the impact of the planes. These cut columns
also detached stairwells and jammed elevators, trapping witnesses in a
collapsing incinerator. In the forth link below in the video you can plainly hear hundreds of detonated cutter charges going off before the building reaches the ground. Another video that got away before they could confiscate or change it. <br/></p>
<p>It
is our theory that the fire proof upgrades where anything but fireproofing
right before 911. We feel from particle evidence that a high-tech nano-therm ate
suspended in a binding matrix was sprayed or applied to key structure points to
weaken and insure complete incineration. We also feel that van loads of thermal   incendiary explosives parked in the underground parking be it therm ate or other were used to insure complete incineration of most evidence.  The picture above from ground zero clearly shows melted granite witch would have to maintain 1200 degrees in a them-ate no oxygen environment for some time to create that much molten granite. Minimal trace of thousands of desks computers, file cabinets all incinerated.(temps recorded at 2,200 degrees a month later)  The time is now. Too much
time has passed already. There will be no sense of normalcy or closure for the
victim’s families or the average American until this crime is brought front
and center to the world, with the result of prosecution from our highest courts
even if it means cleaning house in the Supreme Court.  </p><h2>        Is four trillion dollars enough</h2><h2>          reason to kill and cover up?</h2><h2>Can five bucks change our history? <br/>
</h2>                                          (Watch<b> Pentagon Drone strike.</b> below)<br/><p> 

       It’s my group’s
intention to find out the answer to that question. The purpose of this campaign
is to unite all the people that have worked so hard on researching 911.<span>  We have to raise funds to
broadcast a one hour infomercial to educate a world that has bought into the
fallacy of the 911 commission report and the mainstream media’s brainwashing
that took place during 911 and days after.  It’s time to shed light on many of the seeded
government misinformation campaigns that took place. It is also dedicated to the families that lost
loved ones that horrific day and to our military families who lost mothers,
fathers and children from the conflicts that followed and to our future
generations. <br/></span></p><p><span></span></p><p>Give us 30 minutes and we will have you wanting to read more.</p>
<div>Give us 45 minutes and you will want to know Who ,how and why.<p>Give
 us one hour and you should be so mad that your view on America 
has now changed and you will join us seeking justice.</p>
<div>      The
 only reason not to give yourself the time to look with an open mind at 
the top down propaganda from 911 is that most are too insecure and can’t
 handle their core beliefs in there government being rocked. The view of American exceptional-ism
 that has been pumped into the peoples heads that it could never happen 
here, It's just not possible. We have news for you it’s very possible and 
it happened and you owe yourself, your children and future generations 
truth and justice. If you consider yourself a smart person take the few 
minutes to look to make a sound judgment at what millions of people have
 been talking about that the media has blocked out.</div>
</div><span>      We are seeking funding to make a one hour
infomercial featuring the best of the best. We have a panel comprised of
demolition experts, architectural engineers, recently retired J.S.O.C military
command,FAA and radar specialists, retired N.O.R.A.D military personal, Middle East
and Israel foreign policy specialists and radio flight control experts. We will have misinformation experts to explain
the mockingbird program and war game directors. We will reproduce the events of
911 and show just how many people would have to have had prior knowledge for
the events to take place. Not as many as you would think. Most just did their
jobs and were not paid to think, just follow orders.  We will also have special guests that will
not be disclosed until the first airing to protect their safety and identity. Working
in conjunction with the top researchers of 911 and researchers bringing to
light Americas past thirty years of history, we will reveal facts pertinent to
understanding what happened and why. A
one hour infomercial shall be run prime time on independent station’s and
christen satellite networks. We have been in planing for over five years and just lack funding. If you plan on financially supporting a 2016 candidate, please reconsider and support this cause instead. Until we fix the corruption in government it does not matter who we vote in. <br/></span><p></p>
<p><span>  A free DVD offered will have a petition form
section already filled out, representing your country or state. Clicking the
send link will send it back through our servers. All petitions will be
delivered by hard copy to our government officials at the doors of the White-House. They will have no choice
but to pay attention when we turn this into a large media event. Until we unite, worldwide 911 will be another Gulf
of Tonkin, Pearl Harbor, or other false flag in the side skirt of history. The
only way to get justice is to unite and skip mainstream media that’s controlled
by the status quo. If you are here and reading this page and funding has not

<p><span>  My group’s plan is to have billboard
advertising in place airing the schedule in Chicago, New York, L.A. and seven
other major cities worldwide after the production is made. Funds will be held
in escrow and only paid after guaranteed airing. </span></p>
<p>Production
will take place in a blacked out location, in secrecy, on foreign soil to avoid
government harassment and intervention.<span> 
Our panel members do not wish to be exposed until after the airing. <br/></span></p>
<p>More than ever, there are many more people
willing to come forward, now that some time has passed and they realize the
secrets they hold are eating away at their health.</p>
<p>Blowing 911 wide open can be the open door to
getting our forefathers principles back in America. It can be the catalyst to
campaign reform and ending the FED, if you’re among the 25% of Americans that
know the truth. </p>
<p><span>  Do
something about it! That’s  millions of us, not counting our friends overseas,
times five dollars. That’s a movement, and that volume of noise can’t be turned
down or stopped.  Keep in mind, studio production,
hotel and compensation for our panel of twenty-five, plus air fare can get
expensive. We owe it to our future generations to cut this cancer out of
America and let justice prevail. </span></p>
<p>Anyone who believes the 911 Commission Report
and does not think serious crimes were committed, was simply too busy, lazy or
arrogant to spend just thirty minutes of their time to research this subject. Many
refuse to believe that a few people in government, the same government that was made and
paid to keep them safe, has failed and put a price tag on the heads on innocent
Americans. Fox, CNN,MsNBC and the BBC told you what happened, now don't question it and keep watching reality TV.</p><p> When a false flag crime is committed the perpetrators will plant many seeds of evidence to lead people off in the wrong direction, such as using doctored video to get people questioning all the wrong things. The planes that hit WTC 1 &amp; 2 were refuel tankers that took over the flight paths of AA and United. The doctored layered videos led people to think no planes where used making them sound like conspiracy nuts.</p><p> The jet engine found down the street from WTC was a match to the military refuel tanker fleet out of MC Dill AFB in Florida. <br/></p><p>Directed energy and high tech weaponry misinformation campaign led people in another direction helping kill the credibility of anyone questioning the False Flag Event. When researching all evidence and mini documentaries as a whole, a concise picture is painted.<br/></p><p>  We can post to each other on all kinds of websites and social media pages, but until
we put the facts in front of millions of people  prime time, with a credible panel and a concise plan
of action, <b>nothing</b> will happen.
Until our house of representatives are held criminally responsible for not
responding to the hundreds of thousands of letters received, they will continue
to look the other way, not wanting to be the one who steps up. This first of a two part campaign
will utilize pass- through funding for the first month so that thirty second commercials
on independent TV and radio stations will push traffic to this site. When you
digest the following links, you will begin to understand the last thirty years
and what the select few in our government have been up to. You will find out
just what human lives are worth, <b>FOUR
TRILLION!</b> That’s right! Human lives are worth FOUR TRILLION to these people
and they go to bed without a conscience!  <br/></p><p>  NOW, let’s ask the hard questions of our
candidates that are running for president in 2016 at any and all events. WILL
YOU STAND FOR TRUTH?<span>  WILL YOU
re-investigate 911 with intent on discovering the real truth?  WILL THE NEW PANEL BE LOTTERY PICKED U.S.
JUDGES FROM SMALL TOWNS IN AMERICA, WITH NO TIES TO THE WASHINGTON ELITES?  Will you stop our Washington </span>administration from forcing domestic and foreign policy based on what they are personally invested in. Will you forbid dual  <span>Israeli citizenship in Washington so that the people running Washington have total allegiance to America and not Israel. </span> <br/></p><p>    We are coming up on the second decade of this crime soon, That's way too long, Good must Trump evil, We see no other way! Lets not just tweet about it until it fades away into a falsely created history. For the cost of a happy meal from a hundred thousand of us history can be re-written and the guilty brought to justice.

<span></span><span><p>    Trying to get a grip on the
whole hijacker thing - Were there hijackers? Yes and no. We have the right hand
of government, and we have the left hand wearing a black glove.(Chaney, Rumsfeld, Bush) Through Able
Danger program, we had advanced knowledge of the plan and/or scam of planes
being hijacked. The left hand with the black glove would tip off just enough Intel to the right hand to leave a false trail of these Saudi-Israeli operatives hired
by factions of the  Chaney, Rumsfeld, Bush and Israeli dual-citizen, Washington
administration coup. Most, if not all the hijackers, are still alive and back
in the Middle East. The manifest from the board of transportation shows that none
of those flights that day had ticketed passengers on that day, the planes took
off and landed safely.(see video link below). The remote controlled fuel tankers
that took their place and flight path, hit their targets. The mock painted
drone hit the Pentagon as the planted and stored explosives </p>

large sections of the buildings exterior OUTWARD, taking out the only office that housed
proof of all the stolen and detoured money that went to black ops and to CIA front company's to end up at global corporations owned by the same group of people making the decisions in government the last 30 years.     </p>
<p><span>  Thirty days prior to 911, Donald Rumsfeld
changed the procedure for incoming, unfriendly aircraft. Canada’s prime
minister would not have to be notified or agree to scramble interceptors to
take out hostile air crafts. And thirty days later after 911, the procedure
would be changed back by </span><span>Donald Rumsfeld.</span><span></span></p></span>

<p>“He is former Bob Dole's chief
of staff, very successful counselor and lawyer. He represents hundreds of the
victim’s families of 9/11. He is suing Bush for involvement in 9/11. Now, a
major Zogby poll is out - half of New Yorkers think the government was involved
in 9/11. And joining us for the next thirty-five minutes, into the next hour,
is Stanley Hilton. Stanley, it's great to have you on with us.” </p>
<p>SH: “Glad to be on.” </p>
<p>AJ:
“We'll have to recap this when we start the next hour, but just in a nutshell,
you have a lawsuit going, you've deposed a lot of military officers. You know
the truth of 9/11. Just in a nutshell, what is your case alleging?” </p>
<p>SH: “Our case is alleging that
Bush and his puppets, Rice, Cheney, Mueller and Rumsfeld and so forth, Tenet,
were all involved not only in aiding and abetting and allowing 9/11 to happen,
but in actually ordering it to happen. Bush personally ordered it to happen. We
have some very incriminating documents as well as eye-witnesses, that Bush
personally ordered this event to happen in order to gain political advantage,
to pursue a bogus political agenda on behalf of the neo-cons and their deluded
thinking in the Middle East. I also wanted to point out that, just quickly, I
went to school with some of these neo-cons. At the University of Chicago, in
the late 60s with Wolfowitz and Feith and several of the others and so I know
these people personally. And we used to talk about this stuff all of the time.
And I did my senior thesis on this very subject - how to turn the U.S. into a
presidential dictatorship by manufacturing a bogus Pearl Harbor event. So,
technically this has been in the planning at least 35 years.” </p>
<p>AJ: “That's right. They were
all Straussian followers of a Nazi-like professor. And now they are setting it
up here in America. Stanley, I know you deposed a lot of people and you've got
your $7 billion dollar lawsuit with hundreds of the victim's families
involved.”</p>
<p>AJ: All right my friends, second hour,
September 10th, 2004, the anniversary of the globalist attack coming up
tomorrow. It's an amazing individual we have on the line. Bob Dole's former
chief of staff, political scientist, a lawyer, he went to school with Rumsfeld
and others, he wrote his thesis about how to turn America into a dictatorship
using a fake Pearl Harbor attack. He's suing the U.S. government for carrying
out 9/11. He has hundreds of the victims' families signing onto it - it's a $7
billion lawsuit. And he is Stanley Hilton. I know that a lot of stations just
joined us in Los Angeles and Rhode Island and Missouri </p>
<p>and
Florida and all over. Please sir, recap what you were just stating and then
let's get into the new evidence. And then we'll get into why you are being
harassed by the FBI, as other FBI people are being harassed who have been
blowing the whistle on this. So, this is really getting serious. Stanley, tell
us all about it. </p>
<p>SH: “Yeah, we are suing Bush,
Condoleezza Rice, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Mueller, etc. for complicity in personally
not only allowing 9/11 to happen but in ordering it. The hijackers we retained
and we had a witness who is married to one of them. The hijackers were U.S.
undercover agents. They were double agents, paid by the FBI and the CIA to spy
on Arab groups in this country. They were controlled. Their landlord was an FBI
informant in San Diego and other places. And this was a direct, covert
operation ordered, personally ordered by George W. Bush. Personally ordered. We
have incriminating evidence, documents as well as witnesses, to this effect.
It's not just incompetence - in spite of the fact that he is incompetent. The
fact is he personally ordered this, knew about it. He, at one point, there were
rehearsals of this. The reason why he appeared to be uninterested and
nonchalant on September 11th - when those videos showed that Andrew Card
whispered in his ear the [garbled] words about this he listened to kids reading
the pet goat story, is that he thought this was another rehearsal. These people
had dress-rehearsed this many times. He had seen simulated videos of this. In
fact, he even made a Freudian slip a few months later at a California press
conference when he said he had, quote, ""seen on television the first plane
attack the first tower."" And that could not be possible because there was
no video. What it was, was the simulated video that he had gone over. So this
was a personally government-ordered thing. We are suing them under the
Constitution for violating Americans' rights, as well as under the federal
Fraudulent Claims Act, for presenting a fraudulent claim to Congress to justify
the bogus Iraq boondoggle war, for political gains. And also, under the RICO
statute, under the Racketeering Corrupt Organization Act, for being a corrupt
entity. And I've been harassed personally by the chief judge of the federal
court who is instructing me personally to drop this suit, threatened to kick me
off the court, after thirty years on the court. I've been harassed by the FBI.
My staff has been harassed and threatened. My </p>
<p>office
has been broken into and this is the kind of government we are dealing with.” </p>
<p>AJ: “Absolutely and now it has
come out - five separate drills of flying hijacked jets into buildings that
morning - which you told us about before it even broke in the Associated Press.
They were trying to get out ahead of you. You talked about how you interviewed
military people who were told it was a drill that morning. Then to get out
ahead of that, the news finally reported on it. Now, we've learned that all
these operations - I want to get into that, I want to talk about the new
incriminating evidence of ordering it and how they had drilled on this, how
Cheney was in the bunker controlling this. That has even come out in the
mainstream news but they won't release the details of that, Stanley. But what
type of FBI harassment are you going through? SH: “First of all, my office was
burglarized in San Francisco several months ago. Files were gone through and
some files were seized - particularly the ones dealing with the lady that was
married to one of the hijackers. Fortunately, I had spare copies in a hidden
place so nothing disappeared permanently. But more significantly, FBI agents
have been harassing one of my staff members and threatening them with vague but
frightening threats of indicting them. And it's just total harassment. They
have planted a spy, an undercover agent, in my organization, as we just
recently discovered. In other words, these are Nazi Germany tactics. This is
the kind of government you have in this country. This is what Bush is all
about. </p>
<p>AJ: “Stay there, Stanley, Bob
Dole's former chief of staff. We'll come back after this quick break. Please
stay with us. BREAK to read it all. Go here: </p>

forced to cancel a scheduled appearance in Geneva, Switzerland after human
rights groups filed a criminal complaint charging him with violating
international treaties against torture. His trouble increased dramatically a

officials — were convicted of war crimes in Absentia by a special war crimes
tribunal in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. </p>

not by the President’s lawyer, Alberto Gonzales (though he supported it), but
by David Addington, VP Dick Cheney’s Legal Counsel, who was not so much asked
whether it was Constitutional, as he was asked to come up with an argument for
its being Constitutional, even if only a fig-leaf argument — which it turned
out to be. Cheney actually ran the country, and Bush rubber-stamped whatever
came out of Cheney’s office. Within thirty minutes after the President signing
the order, Addington placed it into his office safe, and he showed it to very
few people, only on a need-to-know basis. President Bush is shown as saying to
the public, “Nothing has changed, by the way. When we’re talking about chasing
down terrorists, we’re talking about getting a court order before we do so.”
And: “It’s important for our fellow citizens to understand constitutional
guarantees are in place when it comes to doing what is necessary to
protect our homeland because we value the Constitution.” These statements were
simply lies from him, and there was no “court order” for anything in “the
Program.” For a long time, the FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act)
Court wasn’t even informed about the existence of “the Program.” So: it didn’t
even have FISA Court authorization. </b><span>

<p>War criminals George W. Bush
and Tony Blair were banned for life in April 2003 from the Church of Nativity
in Bethlehem, widely believed to be the birth-place of Jesus Christ. The ban
was announced at the height of the illegal US-allied bombing and invasion of
Iraq. </p>
<p>Below are the original 2003
press reports pertaining to that decision as well as a subsequent introductory
note published by Global Research in December 2006. </p>
<p>“The Bethlehem sanctuary issued
a ringing reprisal Sunday [April 2003] of the coalition attack, going as far as
barring US President George W. Bush, US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, UK
Prime Minister Tony Blair and UK Foreign Minister Jack Straw from entering
church grounds, due to their “aggressive war on Iraq.”“<b>The priest in the Church
of the Nativity has every right to ban Bush and his supporters since they have
marred the teachings of Christ. Their entry into the church will tarnish it as
[Bush's] hands are covered in the blood of the innocent,” </b>Karmash told The
Jordan Times. The local priest went on to say
that he felt the punishment was not enough. “We need a tougher one to eradicate
evil at its very root,” he exclaimed. </p>

Cheney in Halliburton Bribery Scheme </b></p></span></h3><h4>
<span>
<p>The former vice president was
indicted Tuesday by Nigeria’s Economic and Financial Crime Commission along
with eight other current and former company executives in a bribery and
conspiracy scheme related to the construction of a liquefied natural gas facility
in the country that took place while Cheney was chief executive of Halliburton.
</p>
<p>Halliburton and its one-time
subsidiary, Kellogg, Brown &amp; Root (KBR), were also charged. KBR, which also
has handled lucrative US government support contracts for US troops in Iraq and
elsewhere, was spun off from Halliburton in 2007 into a separate company. (Chaney was CEO of Halliburton) so it would not look good to hand the no bid contracts to them. Easy, Spin off a new company.$$$ Cha-Ching<br/></p>
<p>“It includes Dick Cheney,” said
Nigerian prosecutor Godwin Obla, about the 16-count charge filed in Abuja,
Nigeria’s capital. “There are conspiracy charges,<span>  giving gratification to public officers.
There is also a charge for obstruction of justice…it is important to stress
that the filing of this charge today is just one out of many steps that would
be taken by the prosecution.” </span></p>

                                          Two Part Campaign.        The
pictures above are a stark reminder of the atrocities of 911. There was not a
dry eye in our group when we posted these pictures. The mainstream media was
dictated not to show the events of 911 so the world would forget.

 We
think it is important to show the world right now, 15 years later, that
those who know better and know the truth have not forgotten the day a
piece of America was stolen from us all.  
 
The trust in the U.S. government was gone forever. Along with Building 7,
the trust in our financial system was taken. Investigations were underway to
look into decades of securities fraud and thousands of micro-cap companies and brokers.  Just like all
other Americans that morning, these people just went to work, not knowing they
were part of a few people’s plan to murder and cover for profit. The evidence
plainly shows this. “Textbook” diagonal cutter charges were
implemented to cut the steel columns. The only part of
the building that remained intact, with no evidence of tampering, was
the five story atrium, which was wide open where explosives could not
be concealed or hidden away from view. Those pictures show, along with other
evidence, that columns were intentionally cut in the sub floors to  jamb
doorways just before the impact of the planes. These cut columns
also detached stairwells and jammed elevators, trapping witnesses in a
collapsing incinerator. In the forth link below in the video you can plainly hear hundreds of detonated cutter charges going off before the building reaches the ground. Another video that got away before they could confiscate or change it. 
It
is our theory that the fire proof upgrades where anything but fireproofing
right before 911. We feel from particle evidence that a high-tech nano-therm ate
suspended in a binding matrix was sprayed or applied to key structure points to
weaken and insure complete incineration. We also feel that van loads of thermal   incendiary explosives parked in the underground parking be it therm ate or other were used to insure complete incineration of most evidence.  The picture above from ground zero clearly shows melted granite witch would have to maintain 1200 degrees in a them-ate no oxygen environment for some time to create that much molten granite. Minimal trace of thousands of desks computers, file cabinets all incinerated.(temps recorded at 2,200 degrees a month later)  The time is now. Too much
time has passed already. There will be no sense of normalcy or closure for the
victim’s families or the average American until this crime is brought front
and center to the world, with the result of prosecution from our highest courts
even if it means cleaning house in the Supreme Court.          Is four trillion dollars enough          reason to kill and cover up?Can five bucks change our history? 
                                          (Watch Pentagon Drone strike. below) 

       It’s my group’s
intention to find out the answer to that question. The purpose of this campaign
is to unite all the people that have worked so hard on researching 911.  We have to raise funds to
broadcast a one hour infomercial to educate a world that has bought into the
fallacy of the 911 commission report and the mainstream media’s brainwashing
that took place during 911 and days after.  It’s time to shed light on many of the seeded
government misinformation campaigns that took place. It is also dedicated to the families that lost
loved ones that horrific day and to our military families who lost mothers,
fathers and children from the conflicts that followed and to our future
generations. Give us 30 minutes and we will have you wanting to read more.
Give us 45 minutes and you will want to know Who ,how and why.Give
 us one hour and you should be so mad that your view on America 
has now changed and you will join us seeking justice.
      The
 only reason not to give yourself the time to look with an open mind at 
the top down propaganda from 911 is that most are too insecure and can’t
 handle their core beliefs in there government being rocked. The view of American exceptional-ism
 that has been pumped into the peoples heads that it could never happen 
here, It's just not possible. We have news for you it’s very possible and 
it happened and you owe yourself, your children and future generations 
truth and justice. If you consider yourself a smart person take the few 
minutes to look to make a sound judgment at what millions of people have
 been talking about that the media has blocked out.
      We are seeking funding to make a one hour
infomercial featuring the best of the best. We have a panel comprised of
demolition experts, architectural engineers, recently retired J.S.O.C military
command,FAA and radar specialists, retired N.O.R.A.D military personal, Middle East
and Israel foreign policy specialists and radio flight control experts. We will have misinformation experts to explain
the mockingbird program and war game directors. We will reproduce the events of
911 and show just how many people would have to have had prior knowledge for
the events to take place. Not as many as you would think. Most just did their
jobs and were not paid to think, just follow orders.  We will also have special guests that will
not be disclosed until the first airing to protect their safety and identity. Working
in conjunction with the top researchers of 911 and researchers bringing to
light Americas past thirty years of history, we will reveal facts pertinent to
understanding what happened and why. A
one hour infomercial shall be run prime time on independent station’s and
christen satellite networks. We have been in planing for over five years and just lack funding. If you plan on financially supporting a 2016 candidate, please reconsider and support this cause instead. Until we fix the corruption in government it does not matter who we vote in. 
  A free DVD offered will have a petition form
section already filled out, representing your country or state. Clicking the
send link will send it back through our servers. All petitions will be
delivered by hard copy to our government officials at the doors of the White-House. They will have no choice
but to pay attention when we turn this into a large media event. Until we unite, worldwide 911 will be another Gulf
of Tonkin, Pearl Harbor, or other false flag in the side skirt of history. The
only way to get justice is to unite and skip mainstream media that’s controlled
by the status quo. If you are here and reading this page and funding has not
started yet, be bold. Be the one to start it. Crowd-funding is like the dance
floor at a wedding. No one wants to jump in until someone else does.  Don’t wait for someone else. Please think of
those poor people who did nothing wrong that morning, went to work and ended up
jumping to their deaths. This page is not a medium for what was or was not. The
links offered are to help educate and inform. 
  Look at it this way! If only 80 percent in
what you’re about to read is right, this country has serious problems. Please
give a minimum of five dollars or more, get your bumper sticker or T-shirt for thetruth911.com web site and spread the word. 
  My group’s plan is to have billboard
advertising in place airing the schedule in Chicago, New York, L.A. and seven
other major cities worldwide after the production is made. Funds will be held
in escrow and only paid after guaranteed airing. 
Production
will take place in a blacked out location, in secrecy, on foreign soil to avoid
government harassment and intervention. 
Our panel members do not wish to be exposed until after the airing. 
More than ever, there are many more people
willing to come forward, now that some time has passed and they realize the
secrets they hold are eating away at their health.
Blowing 911 wide open can be the open door to
getting our forefathers principles back in America. It can be the catalyst to
campaign reform and ending the FED, if you’re among the 25% of Americans that
know the truth. 
  Do
something about it! That’s  millions of us, not counting our friends overseas,
times five dollars. That’s a movement, and that volume of noise can’t be turned
down or stopped.  Keep in mind, studio production,
hotel and compensation for our panel of twenty-five, plus air fare can get
expensive. We owe it to our future generations to cut this cancer out of
America and let justice prevail. 
Anyone who believes the 911 Commission Report
and does not think serious crimes were committed, was simply too busy, lazy or
arrogant to spend just thirty minutes of their time to research this subject. Many
refuse to believe that a few people in government, the same government that was made and
paid to keep them safe, has failed and put a price tag on the heads on innocent
Americans. Fox, CNN,MsNBC and the BBC told you what happened, now don't question it and keep watching reality TV. When a false flag crime is committed the perpetrators will plant many seeds of evidence to lead people off in the wrong direction, such as using doctored video to get people questioning all the wrong things. The planes that hit WTC 1 & 2 were refuel tankers that took over the flight paths of AA and United. The doctored layered videos led people to think no planes where used making them sound like conspiracy nuts. The jet engine found down the street from WTC was a match to the military refuel tanker fleet out of MC Dill AFB in Florida. Directed energy and high tech weaponry misinformation campaign led people in another direction helping kill the credibility of anyone questioning the False Flag Event. When researching all evidence and mini documentaries as a whole, a concise picture is painted.  We can post to each other on all kinds of websites and social media pages, but until
we put the facts in front of millions of people  prime time, with a credible panel and a concise plan
of action, nothing will happen.
Until our house of representatives are held criminally responsible for not
responding to the hundreds of thousands of letters received, they will continue
to look the other way, not wanting to be the one who steps up. This first of a two part campaign
will utilize pass- through funding for the first month so that thirty second commercials
on independent TV and radio stations will push traffic to this site. When you
digest the following links, you will begin to understand the last thirty years
and what the select few in our government have been up to. You will find out
just what human lives are worth, FOUR
TRILLION! That’s right! Human lives are worth FOUR TRILLION to these people
and they go to bed without a conscience!    NOW, let’s ask the hard questions of our
candidates that are running for president in 2016 at any and all events. WILL
YOU STAND FOR TRUTH?  WILL YOU
re-investigate 911 with intent on discovering the real truth?  WILL THE NEW PANEL BE LOTTERY PICKED U.S.
JUDGES FROM SMALL TOWNS IN AMERICA, WITH NO TIES TO THE WASHINGTON ELITES?  Will you stop our Washington administration from forcing domestic and foreign policy based on what they are personally invested in. Will you forbid dual  Israeli citizenship in Washington so that the people running Washington have total allegiance to America and not Israel.      We are coming up on the second decade of this crime soon, That's way too long, Good must Trump evil, We see no other way! Lets not just tweet about it until it fades away into a falsely created history. For the cost of a happy meal from a hundred thousand of us history can be re-written and the guilty brought to justice. Please share this page once a day on social media for a month.

    Trying to get a grip on the
whole hijacker thing - Were there hijackers? Yes and no. We have the right hand
of government, and we have the left hand wearing a black glove.(Chaney, Rumsfeld, Bush) Through Able
Danger program, we had advanced knowledge of the plan and/or scam of planes
being hijacked. The left hand with the black glove would tip off just enough Intel to the right hand to leave a false trail of these Saudi-Israeli operatives hired
by factions of the  Chaney, Rumsfeld, Bush and Israeli dual-citizen, Washington
administration coup. Most, if not all the hijackers, are still alive and back
in the Middle East. The manifest from the board of transportation shows that none
of those flights that day had ticketed passengers on that day, the planes took
off and landed safely.(see video link below). The remote controlled fuel tankers
that took their place and flight path, hit their targets. The mock painted
drone hit the Pentagon as the planted and stored explosives 
blew
large sections of the buildings exterior OUTWARD, taking out the only office that housed
proof of all the stolen and detoured money that went to black ops and to CIA front company's to end up at global corporations owned by the same group of people making the decisions in government the last 30 years.     
  Thirty days prior to 911, Donald Rumsfeld
changed the procedure for incoming, unfriendly aircraft. Canada’s prime
minister would not have to be notified or agree to scramble interceptors to
take out hostile air crafts. And thirty days later after 911, the procedure
would be changed back by Donald Rumsfeld.

in 9/11. And joining us for the next thirty-five minutes, into the next hour,
is Stanley Hilton. Stanley, it's great to have you on with us.” 
SH: “Glad to be on.” 
AJ:
“We'll have to recap this when we start the next hour, but just in a nutshell,
you have a lawsuit going, you've deposed a lot of military officers. You know
the truth of 9/11. Just in a nutshell, what is your case alleging?” 
SH: “Our case is alleging that
Bush and his puppets, Rice, Cheney, Mueller and Rumsfeld and so forth, Tenet,
were all involved not only in aiding and abetting and allowing 9/11 to happen,
but in actually ordering it to happen. Bush personally ordered it to happen. We
have some very incriminating documents as well as eye-witnesses, that Bush
personally ordered this event to happen in order to gain political advantage,
to pursue a bogus political agenda on behalf of the neo-cons and their deluded
thinking in the Middle East. I also wanted to point out that, just quickly, I
went to school with some of these neo-cons. At the University of Chicago, in
the late 60s with Wolfowitz and Feith and several of the others and so I know
these people personally. And we used to talk about this stuff all of the time.
And I did my senior thesis on this very subject - how to turn the U.S. into a
presidential dictatorship by manufacturing a bogus Pearl Harbor event. So,
technically this has been in the planning at least 35 years.” 
AJ: “That's right. They were
all Straussian followers of a Nazi-like professor. And now they are setting it
up here in America. Stanley, I know you deposed a lot of people and you've got
your $7 billion dollar lawsuit with hundreds of the victim's families
involved.”
AJ: All right my friends, second hour,
September 10th, 2004, the anniversary of the globalist attack coming up
tomorrow. It's an amazing individual we have on the line. Bob Dole's former
chief of staff, political scientist, a lawyer, he went to school with Rumsfeld
and others, he wrote his thesis about how to turn America into a dictatorship
using a fake Pearl Harbor attack. He's suing the U.S. government for carrying
out 9/11. He has hundreds of the victims' families signing onto it - it's a $7
billion lawsuit. And he is Stanley Hilton. I know that a lot of stations just
joined us in Los Angeles and Rhode Island and Missouri 
and
Florida and all over. Please sir, recap what you were just stating and then
let's get into the new evidence. And then we'll get into why you are being
harassed by the FBI, as other FBI people are being harassed who have been
blowing the whistle on this. So, this is really getting serious. Stanley, tell
us all about it. 
SH: “Yeah, we are suing Bush,
Condoleezza Rice, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Mueller, etc. for complicity in personally
not only allowing 9/11 to happen but in ordering it. The hijackers we retained
and we had a witness who is married to one of them. The hijackers were U.S.
undercover agents. They were double agents, paid by the FBI and the CIA to spy
on Arab groups in this country. They were controlled. Their landlord was an FBI
informant in San Diego and other places. And this was a direct, covert
operation ordered, personally ordered by George W. Bush. Personally ordered. We
have incriminating evidence, documents as well as witnesses, to this effect.
It's not just incompetence - in spite of the fact that he is incompetent. The
fact is he personally ordered this, knew about it. He, at one point, there were
rehearsals of this. The reason why he appeared to be uninterested and
nonchalant on September 11th - when those videos showed that Andrew Card
whispered in his ear the [garbled] words about this he listened to kids reading
the pet goat story, is that he thought this was another rehearsal. These people
had dress-rehearsed this many times. He had seen simulated videos of this. In
fact, he even made a Freudian slip a few months later at a California press
conference when he said he had, quote, ""seen on television the first plane
attack the first tower."" And that could not be possible because there was
no video. What it was, was the simulated video that he had gone over. So this
was a personally government-ordered thing. We are suing them under the
Constitution for violating Americans' rights, as well as under the federal
Fraudulent Claims Act, for presenting a fraudulent claim to Congress to justify
the bogus Iraq boondoggle war, for political gains. And also, under the RICO
statute, under the Racketeering Corrupt Organization Act, for being a corrupt
entity. And I've been harassed personally by the chief judge of the federal
court who is instructing me personally to drop this suit, threatened to kick me
off the court, after thirty years on the court. I've been harassed by the FBI.
My staff has been harassed and threatened. My 
office
has been broken into and this is the kind of government we are dealing with.” 
AJ: “Absolutely and now it has
come out - five separate drills of flying hijacked jets into buildings that
morning - which you told us about before it even broke in the Associated Press.
They were trying to get out ahead of you. You talked about how you interviewed
military people who were told it was a drill that morning. Then to get out
ahead of that, the news finally reported on it. Now, we've learned that all
these operations - I want to get into that, I want to talk about the new
incriminating evidence of ordering it and how they had drilled on this, how
Cheney was in the bunker controlling this. That has even come out in the
mainstream news but they won't release the details of that, Stanley. But what
type of FBI harassment are you going through? SH: “First of all, my office was
burglarized in San Francisco several months ago. Files were gone through and
some files were seized - particularly the ones dealing with the lady that was
married to one of the hijackers. Fortunately, I had spare copies in a hidden
place so nothing disappeared permanently. But more significantly, FBI agents
have been harassing one of my staff members and threatening them with vague but
frightening threats of indicting them. And it's just total harassment. They
have planted a spy, an undercover agent, in my organization, as we just
recently discovered. In other words, these are Nazi Germany tactics. This is
the kind of government you have in this country. This is what Bush is all
about. 
AJ: “Stay there, Stanley, Bob
Dole's former chief of staff. We'll come back after this quick break. Please
stay with us. BREAK to read it all. Go here:

If you truly call yourself a christian watch this next link.

Do you read your bible? Do you back up what the man at the pulpit is telling you? Could millions be deceived? Ask yourself right now, how many times in the last 2000 years have country's, society's and races of people been lied to and led to the slaughter.

Bush Administration Convicted
of War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity 
In February 2011, Bush was
forced to cancel a scheduled appearance in Geneva, Switzerland after human
rights groups filed a criminal complaint charging him with violating
international treaties against torture. His trouble increased dramatically a
year ago when Bush — along with former Vice President Dick Cheney, former
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and several other top Bush administration
officials — were convicted of war crimes in Absentia by a special war crimes
tribunal in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Illegal NSA Surveillance of
Americans: Secret Authorizations Granted by Bush and Obama…….titled  “United
States of Secrets,” this documentary reports that only about a half-dozen
people were informed of this operation, which was called “the Program.” NSA
chief Michael Hayden was informed of it, and he supported it. Attorney General
John Ashcroft was informed of it, but he opposed it as being illegal, a direct
violation of the 4th Amendment, and also possibly of the 1st Amendment. The
Justice Department was sidelined from it. President Bush’s order was drafted
not by the President’s lawyer, Alberto Gonzales (though he supported it), but
by David Addington, VP Dick Cheney’s Legal Counsel, who was not so much asked
whether it was Constitutional, as he was asked to come up with an argument for
its being Constitutional, even if only a fig-leaf argument — which it turned
out to be. Cheney actually ran the country, and Bush rubber-stamped whatever
came out of Cheney’s office. Within thirty minutes after the President signing
the order, Addington placed it into his office safe, and he showed it to very
few people, only on a need-to-know basis. President Bush is shown as saying to
the public, “Nothing has changed, by the way. When we’re talking about chasing
down terrorists, we’re talking about getting a court order before we do so.”
And: “It’s important for our fellow citizens to understand constitutional
guarantees are in place when it comes to doing what is necessary to
protect our homeland because we value the Constitution.” These statements were
simply lies from him, and there was no “court order” for anything in “the
Program.” For a long time, the FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act)
Court wasn’t even informed about the existence of “the Program.” So: it didn’t
even have FISA Court authorization. 


BREAKING: Amnesty International
slams Canada for not arresting George W. Bush for War Crimes

War criminals George W. Bush
and Tony Blair were banned for life in April 2003 from the Church of Nativity
in Bethlehem, widely believed to be the birth-place of Jesus Christ. The ban
was announced at the height of the illegal US-allied bombing and invasion of
Iraq. 
Below are the original 2003
press reports pertaining to that decision as well as a subsequent introductory
note published by Global Research in December 2006. 
“The Bethlehem sanctuary issued
a ringing reprisal Sunday [April 2003] of the coalition attack, going as far as
barring US President George W. Bush, US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, UK
Prime Minister Tony Blair and UK Foreign Minister Jack Straw from entering
church grounds, due to their “aggressive war on Iraq.”“The priest in the Church
of the Nativity has every right to ban Bush and his supporters since they have
marred the teachings of Christ. Their entry into the church will tarnish it as
[Bush's] hands are covered in the blood of the innocent,” Karmash told The
Jordan Times. The local priest went on to say
that he felt the punishment was not enough. “We need a tougher one to eradicate
evil at its very root,” he exclaimed.

“A
SECRET blueprint for US global domination reveals that President Bush and his
cabinet were planning a premeditated attack on Iraq to secure ‘regime change’
even before he took power in January 2001,” Neil Mackay observed in the
Scottish Sunday Herald on the first anniversary of 9/11

Bush’s top counter-terrorism
official for his first year as president – Richard Clarke – tells Democracy Now
that Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld committed war crimes in Iraq … and that they can
be tried at the Hague: 

Clarke retired in protest at
the start of the Iraq war.) 
Clarke is right: 
The Iraq war was launched under
false pretenses 
Top Bush administration
officials clearly committed war crimes in Iraq 
War crimes generally have no
statute of limitations under international law 
Indeed, it is not too late to
charge Bush, Cheney or Rumsfeld for war crimes even under American law And – as
odd as it may sound – it’s not too late to impeach Bush, Cheney or Rumsfeld …
even though they are no longer in office. 

Of
course, Obama is also committing war crimes. For example, the Obama
administration has ordered numerous indiscriminate drone strikes … which are
war crimes (more here and here). And torture is also apparently continuing
under Obama. See this and this. And, Obama should also be impeached.

Nigeria Files Charges against
Cheney in Halliburton Bribery Scheme 

The former vice president was
indicted Tuesday by Nigeria’s Economic and Financial Crime Commission along
with eight other current and former company executives in a bribery and
conspiracy scheme related to the construction of a liquefied natural gas facility
in the country that took place while Cheney was chief executive of Halliburton.

Halliburton and its one-time
subsidiary, Kellogg, Brown & Root (KBR), were also charged. KBR, which also
has handled lucrative US government support contracts for US troops in Iraq and
elsewhere, was spun off from Halliburton in 2007 into a separate company. (Chaney was CEO of Halliburton) so it would not look good to hand the no bid contracts to them. Easy, Spin off a new company.$$$ Cha-Ching
“It includes Dick Cheney,” said
Nigerian prosecutor Godwin Obla, about the 16-count charge filed in Abuja,
Nigeria’s capital. “There are conspiracy charges,  giving gratification to public officers.
There is also a charge for obstruction of justice…it is important to stress
that the filing of this charge today is just one out of many steps that would
be taken by the prosecution.”

</div></div>","ALL THINGS is reminiscent of The X-Files in its moody creepiness and the original Alien film by Ridley Scott in its palpable terror and suspense, and Super 8 in its unexpected turn of hope.


                                                                  ‘First Encounter’ 
The Story
Soon after losing her mother to cancer, college dropout Claire joins an advocacy group to find peace and make a difference in a nearby forest that is shrouded in thick layers of a muggy fog. Separated from her team she is terrorized by unseen alien creatures that make sickening organic-metallic sounds as they crawl around the dense forest and squeal with anger through their disgusting mandibles. Hunted and alone she uncovers the alien invaders’ disturbing agenda and discovers her self-sacrificing destiny.

The Story Behind the Story

Like all great stories, ALL THINGS begins with a question: What if an ordinary person can be given the opportunity to do something extraordinary with their life? And what if this opportunity came, not because they were looking for it, but because they were looking in the wrong direction? Could we make a film that brings to light those mysterious moments in our lives when things come out of left field? And could we tell this story in the vein of a horror-thriller about an alien encounter in what should be the most serene of places – nature?
Veteran VFX producer Richard J. Cook set out to do just that with ALL THINGS.




For Richard J. Cook (IMDb) — a visual effects veteran whose worked on films like Independence Day (Academy Award® for Best Visual Effects), Godzilla and multiple Star Trek films and series during the golden age of CGI when digital effects were used to enhance practical effects — ALL THINGS is a passion project.  Here's a sample of his past work:
If you’re excited about a film that will blend those elements into its own unique story that will harken back to the days when the actors were actually face-to-face with the dripping venom of the alien creature inches away from their face and you could actually feel your palms get sweaty because everything you were seeing on screen was a magical blend of real, practical creature effects enhanced by the subtle use of the latest in digital advances — we’re asking you to be a part of bringing this vision to life! Because now is the time. We can do this together. Now is the chance for those of us who are passionate about unique and compelling stories, to be directly involved in bringing ALL THINGS to life by funding the vision righthere on Indiegogo!

“We went to Patrick Tatopoulos’ office, his creature shop, and watched hours of footage of lizards to see how they would naturally move and react, and we’d try to mimic that. So Patrick, being a practical guy, was showing us how to make CG move. It all starts with the practical.”
The Passion
Rich’s passion for a different,  subversive kind of filmmaking — science-fiction pieces that not only entertain the hell out of audiences, but also explore the complexities of our humanity through unexpected perspectives — comes to the fore in the feature film project, ALL THINGS. A story that has lived with him for a long time that is now seeing the light.

And he’s looking for sci-fi fans like you who truly “get it” when comes to this kind of filmmaking to help him bring this vision into reality.

<p>Over
the last few years, I have spent more time with senior citizens and recognized

means that there are no ‘idle’ children at home to keep the elderly company or

</h3><p>It is said that we have far greater potential then we ever imagined possible, when we harness that potential through using the power of our minds. So far, in a my short career as a hypnotherapist of only 6 years, I have seen some absolutely amazing things and come to learn that hypnosis by far one of the most powerful modalities for unlocking that power. This however, is nothing compared to some of my very seasoned colleagues who have been in the business so much longer than I have. Sometimes when they would share some of their success stories with me, it would leave me in awe. So I decided that I had to get this information out there. People need to know just how powerful our minds are, and what we are able to do with that power. So now I’ve made it my mission to interview the world's top hypnotists and produce a series of and videos and podcasts on Miracles in hypnosis, in order to bring to light what is possible through utilizing the power of our minds. Unfortunately, as I was hearing these stories I simply couldn’t wait to get funding, so I started doing interviews locally with world renowned hypnotists in my home town of Toronto, Canada, or if I traveled I brought my video cam and recording equipment with me in my luggage because I’m totally on fire about this project. And the more I heard the miraculous stories, the more excited I became to make this series a reality on a big level. To date I have succeeded in interviewing some of the world’s top hypnotists, and have lined up interviews with many more across North America, such author and world renowned hypnotist Larry Garret, who was summoned to Iraq to hypnotize a prominent and wealthy business man, only to discover when he got there that it was the infamous son of Saddam Hussein. He then later wrote a book about his experience called Hypnotizing The Devil.<br/><br/>I’ve also posted a short video clip of some of the amazing stories I have already captured from my interviews on <a href=""http://www.intheknowradio.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.intheknowradio.com</a>. You will hear from Dr. Mike Mandel, 6 time award winning hypnotist who talks about using forensic hypnosis to help a victim of an armed robbery recall the license plate of the vehicle involved in a crime from across a dark parking lot, and also how in just one session he worked with a woman who was tormented by asthma for 30 years and was on two different inhalers daily cease to need them any more. Other hypnotists you will see in this video are hypnotherapist and Hypnosis Trainer Steve Roehm. You will learn how Steve helped a woman heal from cancer over a weekend leaving her doctor so amazed he personally drove her tests up to the lab himself. That and other amazing stories from best selling author of The Incidental Guru Cindy Stone, who first used hypnosis to help a woman who had been plagued with horrific nightmares after ritual abuse every night of her entire life. Not only did she stop having nightmares after hypnosis, but her dreams then became a source of healing for her. These are just some of the Miracles In Hypnosis which I would like to continue sharing with the world.<br/><br/>You can help me take it to the next level with one of the largest upcoming hypnosis conventions that are happening in Las Vegas in August. Your funding will help me get access in person and live to the word’s top hypnotists. <i><b><br/></b></i></p><h4>

<p>My name is Sammaia Sharif and I am the founder and CEO of FotoRender and UK Fantasy Events. I have recently both of my companies have been involved in creating new and exciting products for our clients. Over the past four years we have been providing, photographic, film production and live event services to clients in the UK and overseas. During my fifteen years in this industry I have learned much about not only delivering client needs and requirements, more over how to surpass their expectations.</p>
<p>Day Dream Experience is so important to me as a project because this project will enable me and my team to go that one step further in fulfilling not only the needs and requirements of clients but to give them something that they have created with us - Unique and completely tailored to them.</p>
<p>By contributing to this project people will become part of the first ever studio experience of its kind. This is just step one. The support we receive here will enable us to open the first ever public experience of its kind in the world. This is ground breaking stuff and we are right on the cutting edge of something until now was unimaginable and out of the reach of consumers.</p>
<p>All we need is this first operation to open its door later this year and with your help we can do this.</p>
<p>We are passionate about Day Dream Experience and every penny raise will help to make not only our dream a reality. hopefully yours too!     </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul> </ul>
<div>Right now we need to raise the £350,000 of budget to ensure that the studio we are planning to build can be equipped and fully operational, ready to open to the public this autumn. We need to cover location costs, build sets, install technology and create studio settings. We also need to create and market our new brand and services. </div>
<div>All those that contribute to this very special project will receive something really great to remind them  of us and what they have done to help. Every gift will be personal to us and is our way of reaching out and connecting with each contributor. Our team here have been busy working on items that we feel will be useful and above all show our true appreciation and gratitude.</div>
<div>We fully intend to raise as much as we can in order to really drive Day Dream Experience forward, however whatever is raise will truly help with moving the project closer to completion.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul>
<div>Since the projects inception we have faced a number of challenges and expect that there will be more to come. What we are doing is Huge, however we have a wealth of experience and a great deal of practical and technical support. Our experiences working on live events and on location have been invaluable for all of our development. Working constantly in teams, travelling, eating and sleeping together has made us all great team player. Supporting each other, with the common aim of getting the job done and getting it done well! We are proficient problem solving and crisis management. In recent years the British independent film industry has faced  many challenges. We are part of this industry and are very proud of the talent and creativity that flourishes, in spite of all the challenges. We are living proof of this and have the experience and back bone to overcome any challenges this project may present.</div>
<div>One of the areas that may be difficult is the collection of all the stock footage we need to turn each of our experiences into reality. It my not all exist and if it does it may not be in  usable. In this case we will need to work with local researcher on location and shoot the footage ourselves. This being the case we have allowed for at least one of our crews to be made available to go on location and shoot the footage we need. We have looked at the cost implications of this and are confident that this could be achieved without affecting the overall budget.</div>
<div>Another hurdle we may come across is if it is discovered that the studio building is unable to accommodate the complete needs of our project. Location and access are most important, however other consideration such as power and connectivity. In preparation for possible  we will base our plans and designs on a number of construction and layout scenarios. Thus giving us the flexibility to adapt our plans according to the need, without compromising the design, functionality or end product.</div>
<div>Casting is never easy and we are aware that this can take a great deal of time and effort, only to find that you in need of key characters. We intend to work with a number of agencies, who will be commissioned to assist us with initial cast needed and on going needs that we have. We will be conducting all the main casting, however will have back up to ensure that the show will go on! </div>
<div>We have chosen to look at challenges like a giant pizza, if we all dig in it WILL at some point all be gone.....     </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>Being in Film and media we are used to creating a BUZZ, so please tell everyone about what we are doing. Get everyone involved and lets achieve this thing together!</div>
<div>With your help and support we will do this, so lets start today and celebrate our joint at the end. We can almost see the finishing line already, we need you to cheer us on and help us along the way. Join our campaign right now, we really do need you! </div>
<div>We are very proud of this project and the services it is going to offer, so we need everyone to know about Day Dream Experience. As well a needing help funding we also would really, really appreciate everyone's help in promoting what we are doing and sharing our information with others. This is really important to us and will ensure that as many people as possible, will via our Indiegogo platform and share tools be able to get to know about us and what we intend to achieve.   </div>

What we are doing is Huge, however we have a wealth of experience and a great deal of practical and technical support. Our experiences working on live events and on location have been invaluable for all of our development. Working constantly in teams, travelling, eating and sleeping together has made us all great team player. Supporting each other, with the common aim of getting the job done and getting it done well! We are proficient problem solving and crisis management. In recent years the British independent film industry has faced  many challenges. We are part of this industry and are very proud of the talent and creativity that flourishes, in spite of all the challenges. We are living proof of this and have the experience and back bone to overcome any challenges this project may present.
One of the areas that may be difficult is the collection of all the stock footage we need to turn each of our experiences into reality. It my not all exist and if it does it may not be in  usable. In this case we will need to work with local researcher on location and shoot the footage ourselves. This being the case we have allowed for at least one of our crews to be made available to go on location and shoot the footage we need. We have looked at the cost implications of this and are confident that this could be achieved without affecting the overall budget.
Another hurdle we may come across is if it is discovered that the studio building is unable to accommodate the complete needs of our project. Location and access are most important, however other consideration such as power and connectivity. In preparation for possible  we will base our plans and designs on a number of construction and layout scenarios. Thus giving us the flexibility to adapt our plans according to the need, without compromising the design, functionality or end product.
Casting is never easy and we are aware that this can take a great deal of time and effort, only to find that you in need of key characters. We intend to work with a number of agencies, who will be commissioned to assist us with initial cast needed and on going needs that we have. We will be conducting all the main casting, however will have back up to ensure that the show will go on! 
We have chosen to look at challenges like a giant pizza, if we all dig in it WILL at some point all be gone.....

The story of Breathe started conceptually in the summer of 2014. A year later, the team has grown in numbers with the addition of other very talented individuals, and the script has gone through many incarnations and changes to the unique story it is today.</div>

</div>
<div>
<p>I started out my career as a stuntman, with training by Grady Bishop, in 2002. I worked my way up to Stunt Coordinator, getting to work in projects such as Sony AXN latin market (Blue Murder), promo for Brazil and promo for the latin market 1st Annual Stuntman Awards. I have produced and co-produced various shows, including artists Sin City Kiss performing at the Canyon Lounge at Four Queens in Las Vegas. In addition, here are a few projects I have worked on: the NFL Network, PGA Tour Entertainment, and I was also featured in National Geographic's ""World's Toughest Fixes"",  the Miss Universe pageant, MTV's ""Road Rules"", along with various live events.</p>

<h4>RAVI J. SINGH || Writer/Producer</h4>
<div>Everyone is fond of asking me, ""Are you a writer?"" My usual answer, ""God no, I'm just a normal guy with lots of questions and great stories to tell."" I didn't go to college to be a writer, I haven't written or published anything and, most notably, I haven't sold anything. So how could I possibly call myself a writer? With so much to share and no one to listen, I decided to put it to paper, and thus Breathe was born. Ask me a year from now if I am a writer... The answer just may surprise you. I have partnered with three of the most dedicated, hardworking and professional gentlemen in the entertainment industry. They have taught me the ins and outs of the business. I look forward to the the next 12 months, which will be filled with great accomplishments, excitement, surprises, and I'm sure some disappointments. Regardless of what is thrown our way, with our passion, vision and determination, coupled with the desire to succeed, we'll certainly overcome it all and we'll continue to Breathe.<br/>

<h4>JOSHUA RANDAZZO || Music Producer</h4>
<div>I am a Songwriter that specializes in R&amp;B/Hip Hop with classical undertones, as well as a Composer and Producer of tracks. Being surrounded by a family of entertainers, I was lucky to have been exposed to a wide variety of music from different eras, genres, and cultures. Growing up, I was always attracted or drawn to music. I would often sit at the piano and try to play a song I might've liked at the time by ear. Although I've never been given any formal lessons in piano, I've been guided by true talent my entire life (of course, when I would be engaged in learning). With my father's passing being the catalyst, it wasn't until my later teenage years that I discovered a love and passion for creating music. With a classical foundation in piano, I'm mostly self taught as a musician and producer. While I enjoy creating/producing R&amp;B and Hip-Hop the most, I've produced songs for many different styles and genres in my  years of doing freelance work. All the while attempting to maintain an individual style in incorporating classical undertones or orchestral instrumentation as I also have a strong love for classical music. My father and his work continue to be my biggest aspirations, as well as inspiration, in music, and I'm hopeful to be able to portray that in this project.  With this film being part tribute to my fathers music, I'm grateful to have the opportunity to work with these other equally driven and passionate individuals of Breathe.</div>

<h4>ERWIN MARLIN MELLA || Director</h4>
<div>With over 5 years of experience in the audiovisual, storytelling industry in the Dominican Republic, I have been involved in the production of many different music videos, a couple of reality shows, and six different feature films, among other projects. Most of my experience with feature films has been editing such films; working together with other creative visionaries in order to tell the best story possible through audiovisual means. As soon as I got hold of the first pages of Breathe, I knew this was a project I had to get into (specially seeing the drive and passion behind each and every person involved in this project). The story is very spirited and involving. My promise to you is that the film will take you through many emotions as it develops, and will have you on the edge of your seat at all times.<br/>

<div>The story started as a conversation during the summer of 2014 as a potential musical stage show. Since then, it turned into a finished script for a full-length feature film.

<div>Breathe can simply be described as a romantic drama that pulls at your every emotions, at the same time. The story chronicles the interactions of many larger than life characters.

<h4>TEDDY RANDAZZO || Actor/Singer/Songwriter<br/>2007 Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Inductee</h4>
<p>What best way to pull the emotions from the audience with a story of this magnitude than with the music of a legendary singer and songwriter like Teddy Randazzo. His iconic music has transcended the test of time and will appeal to all generations to come.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Teddy Randazzo was born into a musical family. His career began at age 15 as a member of the group, The Three Chuckles, with Teddy as lead vocalist on their very first hit song, ""Runaround."" Soon Teddy emerged as a solo artist, recording such hits as ""Little Serenade"" and ""The Way of a Clown,"" and later going on to perform as a headliner in shows with legendary disc jockey, Alan Freed, at the Brooklyn Fox and Brooklyn Paramount Theaters in the heyday of the Freed-inspired rock and roll revolution.</span></p>
<div>
<p>Randazzo starred in such motion pictures as Hey, Let's Twist, The Girl Can't Help It, Rock, Rock, Rock and Mr. Rock and Roll. He also made seven appearances on the Ed Sullivan Show, which in future years was to become a prime showcase for major league musical talent, including The Beatles and The Rolling Stones.</p>
<p>Randazzo became totally immersed in the music business, producing and writing songs, as well as forming a music publishing firm with famed producer, Don Costa. He arranged and produced records for a diverse group of talents, including Little Anthony and the Imperials, The Royalettes, The Temptations, The Stylistics, The Manhattans and Frank Sinatra.</p>
<p>In 1957 Teddy Randazzo's creative juices began flowing with major hits like ""Pretty Blue Eyes,""  which was recorded by Steve Lawrence and produced by Don Costa, a pairing which quickly brought the disc to number one on the bestselling charts.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Many hits were to follow, recorded by a parade of hit acts of the time, including The Box Tops, Dionne Warwick, Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons, Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington, Jerry Vale, The Lettermen, Linda Ronstadt, Deniece Williams and Luther Vandross, in addition to the aforementioned Temptations, Little Anthony and the Imperials, The Royalettes and Frank Sinatra.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Teddy Randazzo performed in Las Vegas for four years. Over time, he wrote many classic songs, like ""Goin' Out Of My Head"", which has sold more than 100 million records by over 400 artists, and ranks in the top 50 of the most recorded songs in the history of records.</span></p>

It represents LIGHTS, CAMERA &amp; ACTION; for what we need the money and how will we allocate it. The 450K is what we need to make this full length motion picture. It covers the minimum cost for cast, crew, and production. Once we reach half of our goal, we will get things in motion, and share with you, the contributors, our progress. Our fundraising campaign will continue until we reach our goal.</p>

The story of Breathe started conceptually in the summer of 2014. A year later, the team has grown in numbers with the addition of other very talented individuals, and the script has gone through many incarnations and changes to the unique story it is today.



TEVA BATANI JR. || Executive Producer


I started out my career as a stuntman, with training by Grady Bishop, in 2002. I worked my way up to Stunt Coordinator, getting to work in projects such as Sony AXN latin market (Blue Murder), promo for Brazil and promo for the latin market 1st Annual Stuntman Awards. I have produced and co-produced various shows, including artists Sin City Kiss performing at the Canyon Lounge at Four Queens in Las Vegas. In addition, here are a few projects I have worked on: the NFL Network, PGA Tour Entertainment, and I was also featured in National Geographic's ""World's Toughest Fixes"",  the Miss Universe pageant, MTV's ""Road Rules"", along with various live events.



RAVI J. SINGH || Writer/Producer
Everyone is fond of asking me, ""Are you a writer?"" My usual answer, ""God no, I'm just a normal guy with lots of questions and great stories to tell."" I didn't go to college to be a writer, I haven't written or published anything and, most notably, I haven't sold anything. So how could I possibly call myself a writer? With so much to share and no one to listen, I decided to put it to paper, and thus Breathe was born. Ask me a year from now if I am a writer... The answer just may surprise you. I have partnered with three of the most dedicated, hardworking and professional gentlemen in the entertainment industry. They have taught me the ins and outs of the business. I look forward to the the next 12 months, which will be filled with great accomplishments, excitement, surprises, and I'm sure some disappointments. Regardless of what is thrown our way, with our passion, vision and determination, coupled with the desire to succeed, we'll certainly overcome it all and we'll continue to Breathe.





JOSHUA RANDAZZO || Music Producer
I am a Songwriter that specializes in R&B/Hip Hop with classical undertones, as well as a Composer and Producer of tracks. Being surrounded by a family of entertainers, I was lucky to have been exposed to a wide variety of music from different eras, genres, and cultures. Growing up, I was always attracted or drawn to music. I would often sit at the piano and try to play a song I might've liked at the time by ear. Although I've never been given any formal lessons in piano, I've been guided by true talent my entire life (of course, when I would be engaged in learning). With my father's passing being the catalyst, it wasn't until my later teenage years that I discovered a love and passion for creating music. With a classical foundation in piano, I'm mostly self taught as a musician and producer. While I enjoy creating/producing R&B and Hip-Hop the most, I've produced songs for many different styles and genres in my  years of doing freelance work. All the while attempting to maintain an individual style in incorporating classical undertones or orchestral instrumentation as I also have a strong love for classical music. My father and his work continue to be my biggest aspirations, as well as inspiration, in music, and I'm hopeful to be able to portray that in this project.  With this film being part tribute to my fathers music, I'm grateful to have the opportunity to work with these other equally driven and passionate individuals of Breathe.




ERWIN MARLIN MELLA || Director
With over 5 years of experience in the audiovisual, storytelling industry in the Dominican Republic, I have been involved in the production of many different music videos, a couple of reality shows, and six different feature films, among other projects. Most of my experience with feature films has been editing such films; working together with other creative visionaries in order to tell the best story possible through audiovisual means. As soon as I got hold of the first pages of Breathe, I knew this was a project I had to get into (specially seeing the drive and passion behind each and every person involved in this project). The story is very spirited and involving. My promise to you is that the film will take you through many emotions as it develops, and will have you on the edge of your seat at all times.





NATALIE ANDRADE-NEVES || Associate Producer
Growing up, music has always fascinated me and singing has been a passion of mine. Breathe Cinema Studios has given me the opportunity to surround myself with people who share the same interests as I do in the entertainment industry. As an Associate Producer for Breathe Cinema Studios, I'm exposed to many of the different aspects in this industry that has helped me grow as a professional. Being involved in the creation and development of this unique story has shown me how hard-working and dedicated this team is. I still remember the day when this project was just a conversation, and by seeing how much we have accomplished so far, I have no doubt this project will have a successful outcome.






CRYSTAL HERNANDEZ || Associate Producer
As an aspiring writer, I express my thoughts and feelings through my written work. My passion is to someday being able to publish my own books. I'm a person of deep faith and I write stories and inspirational words that portray those same sentiments. Being a part of Breathe Cinema Studios has given me an opportunity to pursue my passion as a future writer. The story of Breathe has inspired and awoken in me a sense of focus, drive, and determination. Breathe will no doubt be successful and I look forward to bringing this script to life.

<p>Jack London, child laborer, pirate,
sailor, and prospector, rose from poverty to become the highest paid, most
popular and most controversial author in the world.</p>
<p>2016 will be
the centennial of Jack London's death. Help Ben Goldstein bring the life and work of this
iconic American writer to people around the world.</p>
<p><b>THE
FILM</b></p>
<p><i>Jack
London: American Original</i>  is the first feature-length
documentary to tell the amazing story of Jack London's life and how he changed
literature and society. </p>
<p>Filmmaker Ben Goldstein weaves 
together a treasure trove of rare archival photographs, film footage, choice
writings, and interviews with leading scholars to elucidate London’s character,
love life, writings, adventures and personal philosophy.</p>
<p><b>From Director Ben Goldstein</b></p>More
     than 30 years ago I set out to tell Jack London's story on film. While
     there have been many biographies about Jack London, a true representation
     of his life, adventures and influence on politics has never before
     appeared on film. 

<p>There have
been so many misrepresentations of his life in the Klondike and elsewhere that
his amazing true story as well as the scope of his literary contribution has
been lost to the vast majority of the modern public.</p>
<p>After many
frustrating years of trying to get a commercial film made, I decided, in true Jack London spirit, to go out on my
own and make this film with the hope that it would reach diverse
audiences.</p>
<p>That is why I
am launching this Indiegogo  campaign. My goal is to raise $10,000 to
support theatrical and non-theatrical screenings and an online release of the film. <br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Although 
     getting a documentary into theaters is next to impossible, I believe in
     this case it is important. I believe the  exhibition of Jack's own
     powerful photographs of the Japanese-Russian War, the slums of East End of
     London, the San Francisco Earthquake, the South Seas, and The Mexican
     Revolution  will be even more powerful on the big screen. These
     photographs have never been exhibited on the East Coast and have had
     limited exhibitions on the West Coast. </li>
<li>These beautiful photographs
     combined with Jack's own writings highlight  the adventurous, 
     uplifting and idealistic nature of Jack's work as he takes on the forces
     of nature,  injustice and  oppression.</li>
<li><b>WHY JACK
     LONDON'S STORY NOW?</b></li>
<li>The
     period between 1890 and 1916 closely parallels our times. The issues of
     the day were financial panics, exploitation by the robber barons,
     unemployment, child labor, homelessness, racism, immigration, the labor
     union movement and Socialism versus Capitalism. In the early 1900’s, Jack
     London was not only the most popular writer in America, he was the
     spearhead for much of the political and social dialogue on these matters. </li>
</ul>
<p>This Indiegogo
campaign is about more than just presenting Jack London's life story or getting
into theaters. It is about bringing  a new generation of readers to delve
into great literature. It is about realizing that the issues of our times: homelessness, unemployment, exploitation of workers, child labor, immigration
and freedom,  are issues that need to be constantly explored, discussed and acted
upon. It is about bringing this vibrant American Icon and this period of
American History to life so we can learn from it. It is about reaching out to a
greater number  of people from diverse communities - young and old - to
celebrate a passion for life, art and political action.</p>
<p><b>HOW WE WILL USE THE FUNDS</b></p>
<p>Our plan is to present showings in theatres in at least 2 major cities: New York and San Francisco as well as in schools and libraries in as many states as possible. After
this release we will also make the film available online through
digital distribution and DVD's. </p>

While the van was insured, these processes take a long time, have excesses if the insurance does pay out, and there will be fettling work to do and equipment to buy for any replacement second hand van we get.  Plus, all the time we don't have a van, we can't earn money from it! We realise there's a faint chance the police might recover the van, but we're told it is unlikely and very unlikely to be undamaged. If a miracle does happen we will let people know so you can cancel your donation if you want (an easy process if done before the end of the campaign). 

If you want to know more about the work of the BCNS, know of a burger van for sale, (or have seen our one up for sale - grrr) or simply if you want to know where you can get superb grub at great canal events around Birmingham and the Black Country, then see the BCNS web page or facebook page

<p><i>Saudade The Series</i> is a psychological character-driven drama, about a fatal accident which generates a ripple effect of incidents upon a family, friends, and even distant strangers, where each of their resulting choices of revenge or redemption drastically impacts the lives of one another.</p>
<div>
<p>The Portuguese word <i>'saudade'</i>
means the missing or longing for something or someone lost. However, there is
the essence of maintained hope for the return of the missing piece and
wholeness. Through this series each character portrays this notion with
their desire to become whole, struggles with unforgiveness or past traumas, and
ultimately their drive to reach their ultimate envisioned dreams. </p>
<p><i>Saudade</i> is a reminder that
everyone has a story, and life is far much more than coping.</p>

Our team is made up of friends and industry professionals and we have been working since June to get this project where it is today.We are now in the final stages of pre-production with locations and actors in negotiations as you read this. We need your help to make this a great film with talented people on both sides of the camera, capable of winning multiple awards.SynopsisThe story of two girls in their early 20s who are caught up in a
huge online suicide pact. Georgia is a quiet person who is abused at home and
after a particularly bad episode decides to seek advice. She finds the website
run by Rose which offers young girls a way out by means of mass suicide in
order to make a stand, to shine a light on the problems they suffer with and to
give others the chance to live a better life than they have. 
We follow the two girls on their final night on the Earth through different
stories and the sad reality that their lives are coming to an end but their
friendship will live on through their memories.
There is a scene involving the main characters stealing a car and going
joyriding and as things go from bad to worse, the world catches up with the
girls’ extravagance and they make a life and death decision. 
Rose will reluctantly jump from a bridge after being chased by police whereas
Georgia will overdose but gets saved by a passer-by. 

The film will be shot beautifully on the Sony A7s MK2 and the Sony A7r MK2 and will also have
footage shot in the snow, on the beach, in the rain, the sun and will also have
some shots which will be shown as flashbacks in a
life-flashing-before-your-eyes style.What do we need?Most of our scenes are set at night, this means that we have had to look into the best lighting and camera equipment to maximize creativity and minimize expenditure to get the best production value.We have spent all of our resources on essential equipment and securing location permissions. We need your help for us reach our final target so that we can take this film all the way.Any money that we raise above our target will be spent on improving the quality of equipment and adding production value to the film.Your ImpactThe team have worked incredibly hard over the past few months to get where we are today and we are so excited to get going.

<p><b><span>1.<span> 
</span></span></b><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>To dream
means to be bold, courageous, fearless, sensible and above all, to believe in
yourself. The difference between having a dream and to make this dream come true
depends on the strength of your spirit - the belief in yourself, how much you
want to achieve this dream, and what effort would you invest to make it happen.
This divine Strength of the spirit drives us to new horizons, as well as all
mankind.</p>
<p>I am
conducting an experiment with myself for several years and here I will tell you
briefly about it. I do not claim that everything I do is right and that I have
to find supporters. Quite to the contrary, I am open to criticism and
discussions, because this way we are getting closer to the truth. The world is
changing every day, and we ourselves are changing and nothing can be extreme in
terms of statements and actions. It is important for a person to have the
correct information and to take decision on his own.</p>
<p>At the
beginning of 2012, I had started the realization of Subproject 1, which
envisages climbing the highest summits of the seven continents on our planet
without consumption of food of animal origin - as a vegan. This is related with
a study of the body and the strength of spirit, which, in turn, in order to
achieve the goal is related to achieving inner peace, a healthy and balanced diet,
reasonable sports and physical activity and culture, and as a whole, a natural way
of life.</p>
<p>How could a
man, who had never played sports and had no coaches, leaders, teachers,
managers and experience in the mountains, achieve the desired results.</p>
<p>In addition to
the highest continental summits and the highest summits on the planet, I am
also climbing many other summits in Bulgaria and abroad and I am also participating
in other sports activities in order to develop and improve my physical and
mental condition and to acquire the necessary skills and experience.</p>
<p><b><span><span>2.<span>  </span></span></span></b><b>Why Veganism?</b></p>
<p>In the
beginning of 2012, I switched to a vegan diet by excluding the consumption of
food of animal origin. I was a vegetarian for the previous six years but I was
looking for a change not only in my diet but also in my lifestyle, a change in
my thinking, in my actions, in my morals, in my behavior, as well as for a
change in my physical body.Everything
was subordinated to my study on excluding the consumption of food of animal
origin from my diet and exploring my body and my mentality. I believe
experimenting is needed in order to find the optimal solution.I am a vegan for almost four years and I still cannot get to thorough
conclusions, but I dare say that for the time being I feel very well and at
this stage I do not intend to change my diet regime. I only explore new plant
foods as well as their combinations.On the other hand, some doctors are sharing the opinion that at the moment
my organism is consuming the reserves of my body and after the 5th or the 6th
year as a vegan, my organism will suffer from health complications.I respect the opinion of the doctors, but for me it is far more important
to test how my organism will function in the future. Of course, as I already said,
this is an experiment and something can be changed at all times, if necessary.
I eat what I find delicious and what I feel like eating.The most important is to know if this diet regime is suitable for us
people, because in this way we will be able to significantly lower or even
discontinue the consumption of animals, which is associated not only to many
advantages and benefits for the human health, but also to protecting the planet
from global pollution and finding a way to feed the increasingly growing
population of people on planet Earth.The agricultural land on which we grow our food and the food for the
animals we eat, is limited and although new farmland is developed in some
areas, in other areas this land is urbanized and its status is changed mostly
to industrial and residential use.Either way, the agricultural land cannot grow indefinitely, it is limited.
But the population can grow as long as there is something to eat. The major
share of the cultivated agricultural land and the pasturelands are intended for
animal feed. If we reduce the consumption of meat and animal products, there
will be more space for plant food for humans and thus the world's population
can grow twice as much. Another very important fact is that the industrial animal breeding is a
very big polluter on the planet. The destruction of the ozone layer is mainly due
to the methane, which is excreted by the digestive system of the animals.
According to the United Nations data, the share of the greenhouse gases as a
result of animal breeding is about 50%.Over 70 billion animals are bred and eaten on the planet each year, and they
are consuming 2/3 of drinking water and contributing to the water pollution and
the entire planet. Also, in order to meet the needs of the market for meat and
animal products, more forests and jungles are transformed into pastures or used
for the needs of animal breeding.This industry has become the largest consumer of drinking water and user of
natural resources. The extermination and exploitation of animals by humans is
another important topic, which I do not want to discuss at present. This planet
is a haven for all animal species and humans and everyone should have an equal
chance to live on it without being grown for human consumption. For me, it is
very important that everyone can eat according to their internal beliefs,
morals and values.</p>
<p>To seek the
limits of the human capabilities and the limits of the vegan which are directly
related to the Strength of spirit and belief in the unlimited possibilities, are
my top priority. Everything must happen first in the head and then to believe
in it, and after that to apply it in practice.</p>
<p>If this vegan
diet is suitable for the most challenging activity for the mind and body - high
altitude alpinism, it means that people can easily live only plant food.Even reducing only the consumption of meat, fish, milk, cheese and eggs in
half will lead to a reduction in half of the harmful carbon emissions from
animal breeding on the planet, as well as half of the land used for growing
food for the animals, can be planted with forests or used for growing plant
foods for humans.</p>
<p><span>3.<span>  </span></span><b>Why the mountain</b><b>?</b></p>
<p>For me, the
mountain is something very special, where I have found everything I needed.
There, I feel free, balanced, in comfort with myself and I can reflect on
everything that excites me and where I can find answers to the questions that I
am asking myself.I believe
that the mountain helps not only to me to feel better, to fill me up with
energy and to teach me, but it also helps to many other people. So, I can only
recommend it to those who have not touched the magic of the mountain yet, and
are willing to do so, to just do it.Trekking, a small hike... if they like it, to continue. If it is not their
place, just to find their place. Everyone has its place on the planet where he feels
well balanced and in harmony with himself and the surroundings.</p>
<p>The mountain
helps me to discover very fine details of my character, and to reflect on life
and its patterns. I cherish Bulgaria and the nature and I had especially
returned to live in our homeland.</p>
<p>We have a
unique planet, which is a wonderful place for the existence of our human race.
Unfortunately, with the globalization and industrialization, we are destroying more
and more the nature and especially the ecosystems by building vast and numerous
animal breeding farms. Every day plant and animal species are disappearing.It hurts me for this planet and I want our children, grandchildren and
great-grandchildren to have the same chance as me to enjoy the beauty and
inspiration of our nature, to share what I see now with my eyes, smell with my
nose, feel with my skin and breathe with my lungs.Just let us all try to live as environmentally friendly as we can, and to
try to protect our planet from pollution with basic things. No man can call
himself and to think about himself as environmentalist while consuming food of
animal origin at the same time.</p>
<p>We have to
go back to Mother Nature. She teaches us many things and gives us answers to
the questions. We need to protect the nature because we will lose it.</p>
<p>Although I
got involved in alpinism and mountain sports relatively soon, I have devoted
myself entirely to the mountain and the nature.</p>
<p><span>4.<span>  </span></span><b>Project goals</b></p>
<p>My goal is
to show to more people that there is another way of life besides the most
common one. That, if a man who had never done sports before could cope with one
of the biggest challenges – high altitude alpinism, it means that we can live a
full life without animal products. Behind all this we can see the Strength of spirit
and the unlimited human capabilities.</p>
<p><b>The
key goal of this project is to test whether the lack of animal food in the diet
of a human would adversely affect his physical and mental qualities.</b><b>On the contrary, to check
whether without the consumption of food of animal origin, the human organism can
function well and can achieve higher physical and mental performance. </b></p>
<p><b>Another goal
of the project is to show that there are no impossible things and everything is
achievable if you believe in it and if you make the necessary effort for that.
To explore our own body and discover what is best for it while trying to fully
protect the environment and live in harmony with ourselves and the nature. To
believe in ourselves and in the strength of our capabilities.</b></p>
<p>This is whyI started climbing all the highest continental summits of the planet as
well as all summits higher than eight thousand meters without the consumption
of food of animal origin from a man who has never been an athlete and has not
practiced any sports.</p>
<p><b><span>5.<span> 
</span></span></b><b>Interim results:</b></p>
<p>With the
climbing the Vinson Massif summit on 22 December 2014, six highest continental summits
were concurred – those of Africa, Europe, South America, Asia, Australia and
Oceania and Antarctica and reaching 6900 meters on Lenin summit, Pamirs for
less than two years. On 01.10.2015, I climbed Manaslu summit in the Himalayas,
as a first expedition of Subproject 2.</p>
<p>I dare say
that I feel much better physically and mentally and I continue with the vegan
diet. Every few months I am going through medical examination and giving blood
samples, in order to monitor the status of major health indicators.</p>
<p>For 2014 and
2015 I have made presentations in various Bulgarian towns - Sliven, Rousse,
Plovdiv, Sofia, Varna, Mezdra, Vratsa, Kozloduy and others. My example
continues to attract young people who love the mountain and the healthy
lifestyle and all those dreamers who believe in themselves, and who want to
find themselves, and through my example, I am clearly showing the realization
of the change to which they aspire.I do not want to impose my way of life to anyone, especially veganism. Let
everyone find for himself the right way of life for him. My message to all is
to find what makes them happy and in balance with themselves and the
environment. Any dream can come true, if you believe in it and you make the
necessary effort. I want to show that there are no impossible things.
Everything is possible and let everyone believe in their dreams and the strength
of their spirit.</p>
<p>But let us
reflect on animal breeding, what it gives us and what it takes from us. For me
it is important that all people have information about the food, especially of
animal origin, and what are the results from its production. How the animal
food got to the table and what did it cause. Then everyone can decide for
themselves what to eat and how to live on this planet.</p><b></b><p><span>6.<span>  </span></span><b>Subprojects:</b></p>

<p><b>History of the
climbing of the 14 highest peaks of our planet:</b></p>
<p>The first person to climb all 14 eight-thousanders was
Reinhold Messner, who completed this project in 1988. It took him 18 years to
climb all of the 14 summits without the use of artificial oxygen. For those 27
years, until now, a total of 34 people managed to set foot on all of the14 summits,
among which there are three women. Of those 34 people, 14 did not use
artificial oxygen when climbing.The fastest climbing of the 14 summits up to now is
done for eight years. Very good physical and mental preparation is needed for
climbing each of these summits, as well as a fee for the summit and inclusion
in an expedition. Around USD 230 000 is needed for climbing all the summits,
provided that they are climbed from the first attempt, which has not happened
to any alpinist, who had managed to finish the project.</p>

results </b></p>
<p>On 01.10.2015, at 5.50 hours Nepalese time, Atanas Skatov managed to reach
successfully Mount Manaslu without using artificial oxygen. Mount Manaslu is
the eighth highest summit on the planet, 8165 m high in the Himalayas. This is
the first expedition from Subproject 2. Despite the difficulties and two
unsuccessful attempts just before reaching the summit, Atanas Skatov did not
give up and made a third attempt with only two days resting between the attempts.Having reached the summit at minus 25 degrees with the sunrise and climbing
all night, because there were 8 alpinists before him, he had to stay 50 minutes
in one place, immediately below the very summit. After that he spent another 20
minutes in the photos and videos at the summit, Atanas Skatov decided to use
artificial oxygen after the summit, which he had brought for emergencies and
breathed about 40 minutes on the way down to an altitude of about 7600 m. Thus,
Atanas Skatov became the first vegan in the world to climb the summit only with
consumption of plant food during the expedition and managed to climb the summit
without artificial oxygen consumption.</p>
<p><span><b>9</b>.<span>  </span></span><b>Findings and
Conclusion</b>.</p>
<p>If this diet proves to be healthy for us humans, it
could reduce the consumption of meat and animal products, which will lead to a
huge reduction in the pollution of our planet resulting from animal breeding
and production of food of animal origin in industrial quantities.Also, agricultural land will be released and can be
used for the production of plant food and thus could help in solving the
problem with the world hunger and the safe increase in the population on our
planet. On the other hand, this will stop the destruction of forests and
jungles, which now takes place in order to provide for the needs of animal
breeding and will reduce the consumption of drinking water supplies.Planting new forests and jungles could begin on the
released agricultural land. The experiment is of great importance to all mankind
and the preservation of the nature on our planet.</p>
<p>The experiment will continue for an indefinite period
of time. </p>
<p>Financial support is needed in order to conduct this
experiment.</p>

</span></span></b><b>Увод</b></p>
<p>Да мечтаеш означава да бъдеш дързък,
смел, безстрашен, разумен и най-​вече да вярваш в себе си. Разликата от това да
имаш мечта и това да сбъднеш тази мечта зависи от силата на духът ти– вярата в
теб, колко силно искаш да постигнеш тази мечта и какъв труд би положил за да се
осъществи. Тази божествена Сила на духът движи нас към нови хоризонти, както и
цялото човечество.</p>
<p>От няколко години провеждам един
експеримент с мен и тук ще Ви разкажа на кратко за него. Нямам претенции, че
всичко което правя е правилно и трябва да намеря поддръжници. Дори напротив,
радвам се на критики и дискусии, понеже тогава се доближаваме по-​близо до
истината. Света се променя всеки ден, както и ние самите се променяме и нищо не
може да бъде крайно като изказване и действия.Важно е човек да има правилната
информация и сам да вземе решение.</p>
<p>В началото на 2012 година започнах
реализиране на подпроект 1, който предвижда изкачване на най-​високите върхове
на седемте континента на нашата планета без консумация на храна от животински
произход– като веган. Това е свързано с изследване на тялото и силата на духът,
който от своя страна за постигане на целта е свързан с постигане на вътрешен
мир, пълноценно и балансирано хранене, разумна спортно-​физическа активност и
култура и като цяло природосъобразен начин на живот.</p>
<p>Как може човек, който никога не е
спортувал и няма треньори, водачи, учители, мениджъри и опит в планината, да
постигне желаните резултати.</p>
<p>Освен континенталните първенции най-високите върхове на планетата,
изкачвам и много други върхове в България и чужбина, взимам участие и в други
спортни активности за усъвършенстване и подобряване на физическото си и
психическото си състояние и придобиване на необходими умения и опит.</p>
<p><b><span><span>2.<span>  </span></span></span></b><b>Защо веганство?</b></p>
<p>Преминах на 1 януари 2012г на
вегански режим на хранене без консумация на храна от животински произход. Бях 6
години преди това вегетарианец, но търсих някаква промяна не само в режима си
на хранене, а и промяна в начина си на живот, промяна в мисленето си, в
действията си, в морала си, в поведението си, както и промяна на физическото си
тяло. Всичко бе подчинено на изследването да преустановя консумацията на храна
от животински произход и да изследвам тялото си и психиката си. Според мен
трябва да се експериментира, за да се намери оптималното решение. Вече почти 4
години съм веган и не мога все още да направя задълбочени изводи, но смея да
твърдя, че за сега се чувствам много добре и на този етап нямам намерение да
променям режима си на хранене. Единствено се запознавам с нови растителни храни,
както и комбинации между тях. От друга страна някои лекари са на мнение че, в
момента организма ми консумира запасите в тялото ми и след 5-​тата или 6- ​тата
година като веган, в организма ми ще настъпят усложнения в здравословното ми
състояние. Уважавам мнението на лекарите, но за мен е много по-​важно сам да
проверя как ще функционира организма ми за напред. Разбира се, както вече
казах, всичко това е един експеримент и винаги може да се промени нещо, ако се
наложи. Аз се храня с това което ми е вкусно и ми се яде. Най-​важно е да
разбера дали този режим на хранене е подходящ за нас хората, защото по този
начин ще можем да намалим значително и дори преустановим консумацията на
животни, което е свързано не само с много предимства и ползи за здравето на
човека, но тук става въпрос да предпазим планетата от глобално замърсяване и
намиране на изход с изхранването на все по-силно увеличаващата се популация от хора
на планетата Земя. Селскостопанските площи, върху които отглеждаме нашата храна
и тази на животните с които се храним, са ограничени и въпреки че се създават
нови селскостопански площи в някои райони, то в други тези площи се урбанизират
и преминават в друг статут на ползване, най-​вече промишлен и жилищен. Така или
иначе селскостопанските площи не могат да нарастват безкрайно, ограничени са.
Населението обаче може да нараства докато има с какво да се изхранва.
По-​голямата част от обработваемите селскостопански площи и пасища са за храна
на животните. Ако се намали консумацията на месо и животинска продукция, ще има
много повече площи за растителна храна за хората и така населението на земята
може да нараства двойно повече. Другият много важен факт е, че промишленото гледане на животни е много голям
замърсител на планетата. Разрушаването на озоновият слой се дължи най-вече на
метана, който се отделя от храносмилателната система на животните. По данни на
ООН дела на парниковите газове при отглеждането на животни е около 50%. На
планета се отглеждат и изяждат годишно над 70 милиарда животни, които консумират
2/3 от
питейната вода и допринасят за замърсяване на водите и цялата планета. Също
така за да се задоволи пазара на месо и животински продукти все повече гори и
джунгли се превръщат в пасища или се използват за нуждите на животновъдството.
Този отрасъл се превръща в най-големият консуматор на питейна вода и използване
на природните ресурси. Изтребването и експлоатирането на животните от човека е
друга важна тема, която в момента не искам да коментирам. Тази планета е убежище
за всички животински видове и човека и всеки трябва да има равен шанс да живее
на нея без да бъде отглеждан за консумация от човека. За мен е много важно
всеки да се храни според вътрешните си убеждения, морал и ценностна система. </p>
<p>Да търся границите на човешките
възможности и границите на вегана, които са пряко свързани със Силата на духът
и вярата в неограничените възможности, са мой основен приоритет. Всичко първо
трябва да се случи в главата и да повярваме в него и след това да го приложим и
на практика.</p>
<p>Ако този режим на хранене като веган е подходящ за
най-натоварващата тялото и психиката дейност- височинният алпинизъм, значи може
спокойно хората да живеят само с растителна храна. Дори само намаляването на
консумацията на месо, риба, мляко, сирене и яйца на половина, ще доведе до
намаляване на половина на вредният въглероден отпечатък от животновъдството
върху планетата, както и половината площи за отглеждане на храна за животните,
може да бъдат залесени с гори или използвани за отглеждане на растителна храна
за човека.</p>
<p><span>3.<span>  </span></span><b>Защо планината?</b></p>
<p>За мен планината е нещо много
специално, където открих всичко от което имам нужда. Там се чувствам свободен,
балансиран, в комфорт със себе си и мога да размишлявам върху всичко, което ме
вълнува и да намеря отговори на въпросите, които си задавам. Вярвам, че не само
на мен планината помага да се чувствам добре, да ме зарежда с енергия и да ме
учи, а и на много други хора. Затова мога само да препоръчам на тези които още
не са се докоснали до магията на планината, а имат желание, просто да го
направят. Един поход, малък преход.…ако им хареса да продължат. Ако не е
тяхното място, просто да намерят своето място. Всеки има свое място на
планетата, където се чувства добре, балансиран и в хармония със себе си и
заобграждащата го среда.</p>
<p>Планината ми помага да открия много фини детайли от
моя характер, както и да размишлявам върху живота и неговите закономерности. Обичам
много България и природата и специално се завърнах да живея в нашата родина.</p>
<p>Имаме уникална планета, която е прекрасно място за
съществуване на нашата човешка раса. За съжаление с глобализирането и
индустриализацията все повече унищожаваме природата и най-​вече екосистемите с
огромните и многобройни ферми за отглеждане на животни. Всеки ден изчезват
растителни и животински видове. Боли ме за тази планета и искам това, което аз
виждам сега с очите си, мириша с носа си, чувствам с кожата си и дишам с
дробовете си, да могат и нашите деца, внуци и правнуци да имат същият шанс и те
да се насладят на красотата и вдъхновението на нашата природа. Просто нека
всички се опитаме да живеем колкото може природосъобразно и се опитваме с
елементарни неща да предпазваме нашата планета от замърсяване. Не може човек да
се нарича и да се мисли за природо-защитник и да консумира храна от животински
произход. </p>
<p>Трябва да се върнем отново към Майката-природа. Тя ни
учи на много неща и ни дава отговори на въпросите. Трябва да пазим природата,
защото ще я загубим.</p>
<p>Въпреки, че
от сравнително скоро се занимавам с алпинизъм и спортове в планината, съм се
отдал изцяло на планината и природата.</p>
<p><span>4.<span>  </span></span><b>Цели на проекта</b></p>
<p>Целта ми е да покажа на повече хора, че има и друг
начин на живот освен най-​разпространения. Че след като човек, който никога не
е спортувал преди, може да се справи с едно от най-​големите натоварвания –
височинния алпинизъм, значи и без животински продукти се живее пълноценно. Зад
всичко това прозира Силата на духа и неограничените човешки възможности.</p>
<p><b>Основната цел на настоящия проект е, да се
провери дали липсата на животинска храна в менюто на човека ще се отрази
неблагоприятно на неговите физически и психически качества. Напротив, да се
провери дали без консумация на храна с животински произход, човешкият организъм
функционира добре и може да постигне високи физически и психически резултати.</b></p>
<p><b>Друга цел на проекта е, да се покаже че няма
невъзможни неща и всичко е постижимо, ако вярваш в него и положиш необходимият
труд за това. Да изследваме собственото си тяло и да открием кое е най-​добре
за него, като се опитаме максимално да опазваме околната среда и да живеем в
хармония със себе си и природата. Да вярваме в себе си и в силата на нашите
възможности.</b></p>
<p>Затова предприех изкачване на всички континентални
първенци на планетата, както и на всички върхове над осем хиляди метра без консумация
на храна от животински произход от човек, който никога не е бил спортист и не е
тренирал спортове.</p>
<p><b><span>5.<span>  </span></span></b><b>Временни резултати:</b></p>
<p>С изкачването на връх Винсън Масив
на 22 декември 2014г са преодолени 6 континентални първенци– на Африка, Европа,
Южна Америка, Азия, Австралия и Океания и на Антарктида и достигане на 6900м на
връг Ленин, Памир за по-​малко от 2 години. На 01.10.2015г. изкачих връх
Манаслу в Хималаите, като първа експедиция от подпроект 2.</p>
<p>Смея да твърдя, че се чувствам много добре физически и
психически и<span>  продължавам да съм с веган
режим на хранене. През няколко месеца провеждам и медицински прегледи и давам
кръвни проби, където се следят нормите на важни за здравето показатели. </span></p>
<p>За 2014 и 2015 година съм направил презентации в
различни градове на България-Сливен, Русе, Пловдив, София, Варна, Мездра,
Враца, Козлодуй и други. Моят пример продължава да увлича младите, хора,
обичащи планината и здравословния начин на живот и всички тези мечтатели, които
вярват в себе си, искат да намерят себе си и чрез моя пример аз показвам
нагледно реализирането на промяната към която те се стремят. Не искам да
налагам на никой моя начин на живот, особено веганството. Нека всеки открие сам
за себе си правилният начин за него на живот. Моето послание към всички е да
открият какво ги прави щастливи и в баланс със себе си и околната среда. Всяка
мечта може да бъде сбъдната, ако вярваш в нея и положиш необходимият труд.
Искам да покажа, че невъзможни неща няма. Всичко е възможно и нека всеки вярва
в мечтите си и силата на духът си.</p>
<p>Нека обаче се замислим върху животновъдството, какво
ни дава и какво ни отнема. За мен е важно всички хора да имат информация за
храната, особено от животински произход и до какво води нейното производство. Как
е стигнала животинската храна до трапезата и какво е предизвикала. Тогава вече
може всеки сам да реши с какво да се храни и как да живее на тази планета.</p>

на проекта</b>: д-​р Атанас Скатов, роден на 11.03.1978г. в гр. Сливен.
Магистър по Растителна защита на Аграрен университет — Пловдив и доктор на
Хумболдт университет Берлин, Германия. Д-​р Атанас Скатов не консумира месо от

активност, като последно се е занимавал със спорт в ученическите си години 1990-1996г.</p>
<p><b>История на изкачването на 14-те най-високи върха на
нашата планета:</b></p>
<p>Първия човек,
осъществил този проект е Райнхолд Меснер през 1988г. Били са му нужни 18 години,
за да изкачи всичките 14 върха без използване на изкуствен кислород. За тези 27
години успяват общо 34 човека към днешна дата да стъпят на всичките 14 върха,
между които има и 3 жени. От тези 34 човека 14 не са използвали изкуствен
кислород при изкачванията. Най-бързото изкачване на 14-те върха до момента е осъществено
за 8 години. За изкачване на всеки един от тези върхове е нужна много добра

<p>На 01.10.2015г, в 5.50 часа непалско
време Атанас Скатов успява успешно да достигне връх Манаслу без да използва
изкуствен кислород. Връх Манаслу е осмият по височина връх на планетата-висок 8165м
в Хималаите, като това е първата експедиция от подпроект 2. Въпреки трудностите
и два неуспешни опити непосредствено преди достигане върха, Атанас Скатов не се
отказва и прави трети опит, като между отделните опити е почивал само 2 дни.
След като достига върха при минус 25 градуса с изгрева на слънцето и цяла нощ
катерене, преди него има 8 алпиниста и се налага да остане 50 минути на едно
място непосредствено под самия връх. След това прекарва още 20 минути в снимки
и видео на върха, Атанас Скатов решава след върха да ползва изкуствен кислород,
който носи за спешен случай и диша около 40 минути на слизане до височина около
7600м. Така Атанас Скатов става първия веган в света, който изкачва върха само
с консумация на растителна храна и по време на експедицията и успява до самият
връх да се изкачи без консумация на изкуствен кислород.</p>

<p>Ако този режим
на хранене се докаже като здравословен за нас хората, би могло да се<span>  намали консумацията на месо и животинска
продукция, което ще доведе до огромно намаляване на замърсяването на нашата
планета в резултат на отглеждането на животни и производството на храна от
животински произход в промишлени количества. Също така ще се освободят
селскостопански площи, които могат да бъдат използвани за производство на
растителна храна и така би могло да се помогне при решаването на проблема със
световния глад и спокойно увеличаване на населението на нашата планета. От
друга страна ще се спре изсичането на горите и джунглите, което сега се прави за
нуждите на животновъдството, както и ще се намали консумацията на питейни
запаси от вода. На освободените селскостопански площи може да започне засаждане
на нови гори и джунгли. Експериментът е
с огромно значение за цялото човечество и за запазването на природата на нашата

Findings and Conclusion

  
1. 
Introduction
To dream
means to be bold, courageous, fearless, sensible and above all, to believe in
yourself. The difference between having a dream and to make this dream come true
depends on the strength of your spirit - the belief in yourself, how much you
want to achieve this dream, and what effort would you invest to make it happen.
This divine Strength of the spirit drives us to new horizons, as well as all
mankind.
I am
conducting an experiment with myself for several years and here I will tell you
briefly about it. I do not claim that everything I do is right and that I have
to find supporters. Quite to the contrary, I am open to criticism and
discussions, because this way we are getting closer to the truth. The world is
changing every day, and we ourselves are changing and nothing can be extreme in
terms of statements and actions. It is important for a person to have the
correct information and to take decision on his own.
At the
beginning of 2012, I had started the realization of Subproject 1, which
envisages climbing the highest summits of the seven continents on our planet
without consumption of food of animal origin - as a vegan. This is related with
a study of the body and the strength of spirit, which, in turn, in order to
achieve the goal is related to achieving inner peace, a healthy and balanced diet,
reasonable sports and physical activity and culture, and as a whole, a natural way
of life.
How could a
man, who had never played sports and had no coaches, leaders, teachers,
managers and experience in the mountains, achieve the desired results.
In addition to
the highest continental summits and the highest summits on the planet, I am
also climbing many other summits in Bulgaria and abroad and I am also participating
in other sports activities in order to develop and improve my physical and
mental condition and to acquire the necessary skills and experience.
2.  Why Veganism?
In the
beginning of 2012, I switched to a vegan diet by excluding the consumption of
food of animal origin. I was a vegetarian for the previous six years but I was
looking for a change not only in my diet but also in my lifestyle, a change in
my thinking, in my actions, in my morals, in my behavior, as well as for a
change in my physical body.Everything
was subordinated to my study on excluding the consumption of food of animal
origin from my diet and exploring my body and my mentality. I believe
experimenting is needed in order to find the optimal solution.I am a vegan for almost four years and I still cannot get to thorough
conclusions, but I dare say that for the time being I feel very well and at
this stage I do not intend to change my diet regime. I only explore new plant
foods as well as their combinations.On the other hand, some doctors are sharing the opinion that at the moment
my organism is consuming the reserves of my body and after the 5th or the 6th
year as a vegan, my organism will suffer from health complications.I respect the opinion of the doctors, but for me it is far more important
to test how my organism will function in the future. Of course, as I already said,
this is an experiment and something can be changed at all times, if necessary.
I eat what I find delicious and what I feel like eating.The most important is to know if this diet regime is suitable for us
people, because in this way we will be able to significantly lower or even
discontinue the consumption of animals, which is associated not only to many
advantages and benefits for the human health, but also to protecting the planet
from global pollution and finding a way to feed the increasingly growing
population of people on planet Earth.The agricultural land on which we grow our food and the food for the
animals we eat, is limited and although new farmland is developed in some
areas, in other areas this land is urbanized and its status is changed mostly
to industrial and residential use.Either way, the agricultural land cannot grow indefinitely, it is limited.
But the population can grow as long as there is something to eat. The major
share of the cultivated agricultural land and the pasturelands are intended for
animal feed. If we reduce the consumption of meat and animal products, there
will be more space for plant food for humans and thus the world's population
can grow twice as much. Another very important fact is that the industrial animal breeding is a
very big polluter on the planet. The destruction of the ozone layer is mainly due
to the methane, which is excreted by the digestive system of the animals.
According to the United Nations data, the share of the greenhouse gases as a
result of animal breeding is about 50%.Over 70 billion animals are bred and eaten on the planet each year, and they
are consuming 2/3 of drinking water and contributing to the water pollution and
the entire planet. Also, in order to meet the needs of the market for meat and
animal products, more forests and jungles are transformed into pastures or used
for the needs of animal breeding.This industry has become the largest consumer of drinking water and user of
natural resources. The extermination and exploitation of animals by humans is
another important topic, which I do not want to discuss at present. This planet
is a haven for all animal species and humans and everyone should have an equal
chance to live on it without being grown for human consumption. For me, it is
very important that everyone can eat according to their internal beliefs,
morals and values.
To seek the
limits of the human capabilities and the limits of the vegan which are directly
related to the Strength of spirit and belief in the unlimited possibilities, are
my top priority. Everything must happen first in the head and then to believe
in it, and after that to apply it in practice.
If this vegan
diet is suitable for the most challenging activity for the mind and body - high
altitude alpinism, it means that people can easily live only plant food.Even reducing only the consumption of meat, fish, milk, cheese and eggs in
half will lead to a reduction in half of the harmful carbon emissions from
animal breeding on the planet, as well as half of the land used for growing
food for the animals, can be planted with forests or used for growing plant
foods for humans.
3.  Why the mountain?
For me, the
mountain is something very special, where I have found everything I needed.
There, I feel free, balanced, in comfort with myself and I can reflect on
everything that excites me and where I can find answers to the questions that I
am asking myself.I believe
that the mountain helps not only to me to feel better, to fill me up with
energy and to teach me, but it also helps to many other people. So, I can only
recommend it to those who have not touched the magic of the mountain yet, and
are willing to do so, to just do it.Trekking, a small hike... if they like it, to continue. If it is not their
place, just to find their place. Everyone has its place on the planet where he feels
well balanced and in harmony with himself and the surroundings.
The mountain
helps me to discover very fine details of my character, and to reflect on life
and its patterns. I cherish Bulgaria and the nature and I had especially
returned to live in our homeland.
We have a
unique planet, which is a wonderful place for the existence of our human race.
Unfortunately, with the globalization and industrialization, we are destroying more
and more the nature and especially the ecosystems by building vast and numerous
animal breeding farms. Every day plant and animal species are disappearing.It hurts me for this planet and I want our children, grandchildren and
great-grandchildren to have the same chance as me to enjoy the beauty and
inspiration of our nature, to share what I see now with my eyes, smell with my
nose, feel with my skin and breathe with my lungs.Just let us all try to live as environmentally friendly as we can, and to
try to protect our planet from pollution with basic things. No man can call
himself and to think about himself as environmentalist while consuming food of
animal origin at the same time.
We have to
go back to Mother Nature. She teaches us many things and gives us answers to
the questions. We need to protect the nature because we will lose it.
Although I
got involved in alpinism and mountain sports relatively soon, I have devoted
myself entirely to the mountain and the nature.
4.  Project goals
My goal is
to show to more people that there is another way of life besides the most
common one. That, if a man who had never done sports before could cope with one
of the biggest challenges – high altitude alpinism, it means that we can live a
full life without animal products. Behind all this we can see the Strength of spirit
and the unlimited human capabilities.
The
key goal of this project is to test whether the lack of animal food in the diet
of a human would adversely affect his physical and mental qualities.On the contrary, to check
whether without the consumption of food of animal origin, the human organism can
function well and can achieve higher physical and mental performance. 
Another goal
of the project is to show that there are no impossible things and everything is
achievable if you believe in it and if you make the necessary effort for that.
To explore our own body and discover what is best for it while trying to fully
protect the environment and live in harmony with ourselves and the nature. To
believe in ourselves and in the strength of our capabilities.
This is whyI started climbing all the highest continental summits of the planet as
well as all summits higher than eight thousand meters without the consumption
of food of animal origin from a man who has never been an athlete and has not
practiced any sports.
5. 
Interim results:
With the
climbing the Vinson Massif summit on 22 December 2014, six highest continental summits
were concurred – those of Africa, Europe, South America, Asia, Australia and
Oceania and Antarctica and reaching 6900 meters on Lenin summit, Pamirs for
less than two years. On 01.10.2015, I climbed Manaslu summit in the Himalayas,
as a first expedition of Subproject 2.
I dare say
that I feel much better physically and mentally and I continue with the vegan
diet. Every few months I am going through medical examination and giving blood
samples, in order to monitor the status of major health indicators.
For 2014 and
2015 I have made presentations in various Bulgarian towns - Sliven, Rousse,
Plovdiv, Sofia, Varna, Mezdra, Vratsa, Kozloduy and others. My example
continues to attract young people who love the mountain and the healthy
lifestyle and all those dreamers who believe in themselves, and who want to
find themselves, and through my example, I am clearly showing the realization
of the change to which they aspire.I do not want to impose my way of life to anyone, especially veganism. Let
everyone find for himself the right way of life for him. My message to all is
to find what makes them happy and in balance with themselves and the
environment. Any dream can come true, if you believe in it and you make the
necessary effort. I want to show that there are no impossible things.
Everything is possible and let everyone believe in their dreams and the strength
of their spirit.
But let us
reflect on animal breeding, what it gives us and what it takes from us. For me
it is important that all people have information about the food, especially of
animal origin, and what are the results from its production. How the animal
food got to the table and what did it cause. Then everyone can decide for
themselves what to eat and how to live on this planet.6.  Subprojects:

Start of the project: 01.09.2015.
End of the project: 31.12.2020.
Implementation of the project by: Dr.  Atanas Skatov was born on 11.03.1978 in the
town of Sliven. Master of Plant Protection at the Agricultural University -
Plovdiv and Doctor of the Humboldt University Berlin, Germany. Dr.  Atanas Skatov did not consume meat since
January 2007, and fish since 6 December 2009. In early 2012, he ceased the
consumption of animal food. Until the summer of 2010, Atanas Skatov carried
almost no physical activity, the last time he had been involved in sports was during
his school years, 1990-1996.
History of the
climbing of the 14 highest peaks of our planet:
The first person to climb all 14 eight-thousanders was
Reinhold Messner, who completed this project in 1988. It took him 18 years to
climb all of the 14 summits without the use of artificial oxygen. For those 27
years, until now, a total of 34 people managed to set foot on all of the14 summits,
among which there are three women. Of those 34 people, 14 did not use
artificial oxygen when climbing.The fastest climbing of the 14 summits up to now is
done for eight years. Very good physical and mental preparation is needed for
climbing each of these summits, as well as a fee for the summit and inclusion
in an expedition. Around USD 230 000 is needed for climbing all the summits,
provided that they are climbed from the first attempt, which has not happened
to any alpinist, who had managed to finish the project.
Goal of Subproject
2: 
1. 
Climbing of the
14 eight-thousanders by a vegan; (for the first time in the world)
2. 
Climbing 4
eight-thousanders in one season for 100 days; (for the first time in the world)3. 
Climbing the 14 eight-thousanders
for less than 6 years, or as quickly as possible by a vegan, to challenge the
body as much as possible. (for the first time in the world)
All of the identified goals have not been achieved so
far, even by a person with a common ""normal"" diet and professional
alpine training. 
7. 
Material and Method:
-maintaining very good physical shape, healthy spirit
and mentality;
-year-round training in Bulgaria and abroad;
-vegan diet; Only 100% plant food;
-conducting detailed medical and laboratory tests for
my health condition;
-collecting the necessary financial resources to carry
out the expeditions;
-daily records containing descriptions of the physical
activity, food consumption by type and quantity and other relevant details;
-description of each expedition in a book and shooting
of a film;
-distributing activities through presentations in
Bulgaria and abroad, books, films, brochures, participation in festivals around
the world and more;





8.  Subproject 2 Interim
results 
On 01.10.2015, at 5.50 hours Nepalese time, Atanas Skatov managed to reach
successfully Mount Manaslu without using artificial oxygen. Mount Manaslu is
the eighth highest summit on the planet, 8165 m high in the Himalayas. This is
the first expedition from Subproject 2. Despite the difficulties and two
unsuccessful attempts just before reaching the summit, Atanas Skatov did not
give up and made a third attempt with only two days resting between the attempts.Having reached the summit at minus 25 degrees with the sunrise and climbing
all night, because there were 8 alpinists before him, he had to stay 50 minutes
in one place, immediately below the very summit. After that he spent another 20
minutes in the photos and videos at the summit, Atanas Skatov decided to use
artificial oxygen after the summit, which he had brought for emergencies and
breathed about 40 minutes on the way down to an altitude of about 7600 m. Thus,
Atanas Skatov became the first vegan in the world to climb the summit only with
consumption of plant food during the expedition and managed to climb the summit
without artificial oxygen consumption.
9.  Findings and
Conclusion.
If this diet proves to be healthy for us humans, it
could reduce the consumption of meat and animal products, which will lead to a
huge reduction in the pollution of our planet resulting from animal breeding
and production of food of animal origin in industrial quantities.Also, agricultural land will be released and can be
used for the production of plant food and thus could help in solving the
problem with the world hunger and the safe increase in the population on our
planet. On the other hand, this will stop the destruction of forests and
jungles, which now takes place in order to provide for the needs of animal
breeding and will reduce the consumption of drinking water supplies.Planting new forests and jungles could begin on the
released agricultural land. The experiment is of great importance to all mankind
and the preservation of the nature on our planet.
The experiment will continue for an indefinite period
of time. 
Financial support is needed in order to conduct this
experiment.

Увод
Да мечтаеш означава да бъдеш дързък,
смел, безстрашен, разумен и най-​вече да вярваш в себе си. Разликата от това да
имаш мечта и това да сбъднеш тази мечта зависи от силата на духът ти– вярата в
теб, колко силно искаш да постигнеш тази мечта и какъв труд би положил за да се
осъществи. Тази божествена Сила на духът движи нас към нови хоризонти, както и
цялото човечество.
От няколко години провеждам един
експеримент с мен и тук ще Ви разкажа на кратко за него. Нямам претенции, че
всичко което правя е правилно и трябва да намеря поддръжници. Дори напротив,
радвам се на критики и дискусии, понеже тогава се доближаваме по-​близо до
истината. Света се променя всеки ден, както и ние самите се променяме и нищо не
може да бъде крайно като изказване и действия.Важно е човек да има правилната
информация и сам да вземе решение.
В началото на 2012 година започнах
реализиране на подпроект 1, който предвижда изкачване на най-​високите върхове
на седемте континента на нашата планета без консумация на храна от животински
произход– като веган. Това е свързано с изследване на тялото и силата на духът,
който от своя страна за постигане на целта е свързан с постигане на вътрешен
мир, пълноценно и балансирано хранене, разумна спортно-​физическа активност и
култура и като цяло природосъобразен начин на живот.
Как може човек, който никога не е
спортувал и няма треньори, водачи, учители, мениджъри и опит в планината, да
постигне желаните резултати.
Освен континенталните първенции най-високите върхове на планетата,
изкачвам и много други върхове в България и чужбина, взимам участие и в други
спортни активности за усъвършенстване и подобряване на физическото си и
психическото си състояние и придобиване на необходими умения и опит.
2.  Защо веганство?
Преминах на 1 януари 2012г на
вегански режим на хранене без консумация на храна от животински произход. Бях 6
години преди това вегетарианец, но търсих някаква промяна не само в режима си
на хранене, а и промяна в начина си на живот, промяна в мисленето си, в
действията си, в морала си, в поведението си, както и промяна на физическото си
тяло. Всичко бе подчинено на изследването да преустановя консумацията на храна
от животински произход и да изследвам тялото си и психиката си. Според мен
трябва да се експериментира, за да се намери оптималното решение. Вече почти 4
години съм веган и не мога все още да направя задълбочени изводи, но смея да
твърдя, че за сега се чувствам много добре и на този етап нямам намерение да
променям режима си на хранене. Единствено се запознавам с нови растителни храни,
както и комбинации между тях. От друга страна някои лекари са на мнение че, в
момента организма ми консумира запасите в тялото ми и след 5-​тата или 6- ​тата
година като веган, в организма ми ще настъпят усложнения в здравословното ми
състояние. Уважавам мнението на лекарите, но за мен е много по-​важно сам да
проверя как ще функционира организма ми за напред. Разбира се, както вече
казах, всичко това е един експеримент и винаги може да се промени нещо, ако се
наложи. Аз се храня с това което ми е вкусно и ми се яде. Най-​важно е да
разбера дали този режим на хранене е подходящ за нас хората, защото по този
начин ще можем да намалим значително и дори преустановим консумацията на
животни, което е свързано не само с много предимства и ползи за здравето на
човека, но тук става въпрос да предпазим планетата от глобално замърсяване и
намиране на изход с изхранването на все по-силно увеличаващата се популация от хора
на планетата Земя. Селскостопанските площи, върху които отглеждаме нашата храна
и тази на животните с които се храним, са ограничени и въпреки че се създават
нови селскостопански площи в някои райони, то в други тези площи се урбанизират
и преминават в друг статут на ползване, най-​вече промишлен и жилищен. Така или
иначе селскостопанските площи не могат да нарастват безкрайно, ограничени са.
Населението обаче може да нараства докато има с какво да се изхранва.
По-​голямата част от обработваемите селскостопански площи и пасища са за храна
на животните. Ако се намали консумацията на месо и животинска продукция, ще има
много повече площи за растителна храна за хората и така населението на земята
може да нараства двойно повече. Другият много важен факт е, че промишленото гледане на животни е много голям
замърсител на планетата. Разрушаването на озоновият слой се дължи най-вече на
метана, който се отделя от храносмилателната система на животните. По данни на
ООН дела на парниковите газове при отглеждането на животни е около 50%. На
планета се отглеждат и изяждат годишно над 70 милиарда животни, които консумират
2/3 от
питейната вода и допринасят за замърсяване на водите и цялата планета. Също
така за да се задоволи пазара на месо и животински продукти все повече гори и
джунгли се превръщат в пасища или се използват за нуждите на животновъдството.
Този отрасъл се превръща в най-големият консуматор на питейна вода и използване
на природните ресурси. Изтребването и експлоатирането на животните от човека е
друга важна тема, която в момента не искам да коментирам. Тази планета е убежище
за всички животински видове и човека и всеки трябва да има равен шанс да живее
на нея без да бъде отглеждан за консумация от човека. За мен е много важно
всеки да се храни според вътрешните си убеждения, морал и ценностна система. 
Да търся границите на човешките
възможности и границите на вегана, които са пряко свързани със Силата на духът
и вярата в неограничените възможности, са мой основен приоритет. Всичко първо
трябва да се случи в главата и да повярваме в него и след това да го приложим и
на практика.
Ако този режим на хранене като веган е подходящ за
най-натоварващата тялото и психиката дейност- височинният алпинизъм, значи може
спокойно хората да живеят само с растителна храна. Дори само намаляването на
консумацията на месо, риба, мляко, сирене и яйца на половина, ще доведе до
намаляване на половина на вредният въглероден отпечатък от животновъдството
върху планетата, както и половината площи за отглеждане на храна за животните,
може да бъдат залесени с гори или използвани за отглеждане на растителна храна
за човека.
3.  Защо планината?
За мен планината е нещо много
специално, където открих всичко от което имам нужда. Там се чувствам свободен,
балансиран, в комфорт със себе си и мога да размишлявам върху всичко, което ме
вълнува и да намеря отговори на въпросите, които си задавам. Вярвам, че не само
на мен планината помага да се чувствам добре, да ме зарежда с енергия и да ме
учи, а и на много други хора. Затова мога само да препоръчам на тези които още
не са се докоснали до магията на планината, а имат желание, просто да го
направят. Един поход, малък преход.…ако им хареса да продължат. Ако не е
тяхното място, просто да намерят своето място. Всеки има свое място на
планетата, където се чувства добре, балансиран и в хармония със себе си и
заобграждащата го среда.
Планината ми помага да открия много фини детайли от
моя характер, както и да размишлявам върху живота и неговите закономерности. Обичам
много България и природата и специално се завърнах да живея в нашата родина.
Имаме уникална планета, която е прекрасно място за
съществуване на нашата човешка раса. За съжаление с глобализирането и
индустриализацията все повече унищожаваме природата и най-​вече екосистемите с
огромните и многобройни ферми за отглеждане на животни. Всеки ден изчезват
растителни и животински видове. Боли ме за тази планета и искам това, което аз
виждам сега с очите си, мириша с носа си, чувствам с кожата си и дишам с
дробовете си, да могат и нашите деца, внуци и правнуци да имат същият шанс и те
да се насладят на красотата и вдъхновението на нашата природа. Просто нека
всички се опитаме да живеем колкото може природосъобразно и се опитваме с
елементарни неща да предпазваме нашата планета от замърсяване. Не може човек да
се нарича и да се мисли за природо-защитник и да консумира храна от животински
произход. 
Трябва да се върнем отново към Майката-природа. Тя ни
учи на много неща и ни дава отговори на въпросите. Трябва да пазим природата,
защото ще я загубим.
Въпреки, че
от сравнително скоро се занимавам с алпинизъм и спортове в планината, съм се
отдал изцяло на планината и природата.
4.  Цели на проекта
Целта ми е да покажа на повече хора, че има и друг
начин на живот освен най-​разпространения. Че след като човек, който никога не
е спортувал преди, може да се справи с едно от най-​големите натоварвания –
височинния алпинизъм, значи и без животински продукти се живее пълноценно. Зад
всичко това прозира Силата на духа и неограничените човешки възможности.
Основната цел на настоящия проект е, да се
провери дали липсата на животинска храна в менюто на човека ще се отрази
неблагоприятно на неговите физически и психически качества. Напротив, да се
провери дали без консумация на храна с животински произход, човешкият организъм
функционира добре и може да постигне високи физически и психически резултати.
Друга цел на проекта е, да се покаже че няма
невъзможни неща и всичко е постижимо, ако вярваш в него и положиш необходимият
труд за това. Да изследваме собственото си тяло и да открием кое е най-​добре
за него, като се опитаме максимално да опазваме околната среда и да живеем в
хармония със себе си и природата. Да вярваме в себе си и в силата на нашите
възможности.
Затова предприех изкачване на всички континентални
първенци на планетата, както и на всички върхове над осем хиляди метра без консумация
на храна от животински произход от човек, който никога не е бил спортист и не е
тренирал спортове.
5.  Временни резултати:
С изкачването на връх Винсън Масив
на 22 декември 2014г са преодолени 6 континентални първенци– на Африка, Европа,
Южна Америка, Азия, Австралия и Океания и на Антарктида и достигане на 6900м на
връг Ленин, Памир за по-​малко от 2 години. На 01.10.2015г. изкачих връх
Манаслу в Хималаите, като първа експедиция от подпроект 2.
Смея да твърдя, че се чувствам много добре физически и
психически и  продължавам да съм с веган
режим на хранене. През няколко месеца провеждам и медицински прегледи и давам
кръвни проби, където се следят нормите на важни за здравето показатели. 
За 2014 и 2015 година съм направил презентации в
различни градове на България-Сливен, Русе, Пловдив, София, Варна, Мездра,
Враца, Козлодуй и други. Моят пример продължава да увлича младите, хора,
обичащи планината и здравословния начин на живот и всички тези мечтатели, които
вярват в себе си, искат да намерят себе си и чрез моя пример аз показвам
нагледно реализирането на промяната към която те се стремят. Не искам да
налагам на никой моя начин на живот, особено веганството. Нека всеки открие сам
за себе си правилният начин за него на живот. Моето послание към всички е да
открият какво ги прави щастливи и в баланс със себе си и околната среда. Всяка
мечта може да бъде сбъдната, ако вярваш в нея и положиш необходимият труд.
Искам да покажа, че невъзможни неща няма. Всичко е възможно и нека всеки вярва
в мечтите си и силата на духът си.
Нека обаче се замислим върху животновъдството, какво
ни дава и какво ни отнема. За мен е важно всички хора да имат информация за
храната, особено от животински произход и до какво води нейното производство. Как
е стигнала животинската храна до трапезата и какво е предизвикала. Тогава вече
може всеки сам да реши с какво да се храни и как да живее на тази планета.

Начало на
проекта: 01.09.2015г.
Край на
проекта: 31.12.2020г.
Изпълнител
на проекта: д-​р Атанас Скатов, роден на 11.03.1978г. в гр. Сливен.
Магистър по Растителна защита на Аграрен университет — Пловдив и доктор на
Хумболдт университет Берлин, Германия. Д-​р Атанас Скатов не консумира месо от

активност, като последно се е занимавал със спорт в ученическите си години 1990-1996г.
История на изкачването на 14-те най-високи върха на
нашата планета:
Първия човек,
осъществил този проект е Райнхолд Меснер през 1988г. Били са му нужни 18 години,
за да изкачи всичките 14 върха без използване на изкуствен кислород. За тези 27
години успяват общо 34 човека към днешна дата да стъпят на всичките 14 върха,
между които има и 3 жени. От тези 34 човека 14 не са използвали изкуствен
кислород при изкачванията. Най-бързото изкачване на 14-те върха до момента е осъществено
за 8 години. За изкачване на всеки един от тези върхове е нужна много добра
физическа и психическа подготовка, както и заплащане на такса за върха и включване в експедиция. За изкачване на всичките върхове
са нужни около 230 000 долара, при положение че бъдат изкачвани от първи
опит, което досега не се е случило с нито един алпинист, успял да завърши
проекта си.
Цели на подпроект 2: 
1. 
Изкачване
на 14-те осемхилядници от веган; (за първи път в света)
2. 
Изкачване
на 4-ри осемхилядника в един сезонза 100 дни; (за
първи път в света)
3. 
Изкачване
на 5 осемхилядника в една календарна година; (за първи път в света)
4. 
Изкачване
на 6 осемхилядника за 12 месеца; (за първи път в света)
5. 
Изкачване
на 14 осемхилядника за по-малко от 6 години или колкото може по-бързо от веган,
за да се натовари тялото на възможно максимална степен. (за първи път в света)
Всички набелязани
цели не са постигани досега дори и от човек с общ „нормален“ режим на хранене и
професионална алпийска подготовка. 
7. 
Материал и метод:
-подържане на висока спортна форма,
здрав дух и психика;
-целогодишни тренировки в България и
чужбина;
-вегански режим на хранене; 100% само
растителна храна;
-извършване на подробни медицински и
лабораторни изследвания за здравословното ми състояния;
-събиране на нужните финансови средства
за осъществяване на експедициите;
-всекидневно водене на дневник с
описание на физическата натовареност, консумираната храна по вид и количество и
други важни подробности;
-описване на всяка експедиция в книга и
заснемане на филм;
-разпространение на дейността чрез
презентации в България и чужбина, книги, филми, брошури, участие във фестивали в
цял святи др.;

Временни
резултати на подпроект 2
На 01.10.2015г, в 5.50 часа непалско
време Атанас Скатов успява успешно да достигне връх Манаслу без да използва
изкуствен кислород. Връх Манаслу е осмият по височина връх на планетата-висок 8165м
в Хималаите, като това е първата експедиция от подпроект 2. Въпреки трудностите
и два неуспешни опити непосредствено преди достигане върха, Атанас Скатов не се
отказва и прави трети опит, като между отделните опити е почивал само 2 дни.
След като достига върха при минус 25 градуса с изгрева на слънцето и цяла нощ
катерене, преди него има 8 алпиниста и се налага да остане 50 минути на едно
място непосредствено под самия връх. След това прекарва още 20 минути в снимки
и видео на върха, Атанас Скатов решава след върха да ползва изкуствен кислород,
който носи за спешен случай и диша около 40 минути на слизане до височина около
7600м. Така Атанас Скатов става първия веган в света, който изкачва върха само
с консумация на растителна храна и по време на експедицията и успява до самият
връх да се изкачи без консумация на изкуствен кислород.
9. 
Изводи и
заключение.
Ако този режим
на хранене се докаже като здравословен за нас хората, би могло да се  намали консумацията на месо и животинска
продукция, което ще доведе до огромно намаляване на замърсяването на нашата
планета в резултат на отглеждането на животни и производството на храна от
животински произход в промишлени количества. Също така ще се освободят
селскостопански площи, които могат да бъдат използвани за производство на
растителна храна и така би могло да се помогне при решаването на проблема със
световния глад и спокойно увеличаване на населението на нашата планета. От
друга страна ще се спре изсичането на горите и джунглите, което сега се прави за
нуждите на животновъдството, както и ще се намали консумацията на питейни
запаси от вода. На освободените селскостопански площи може да започне засаждане
на нови гори и джунгли. Експериментът е
с огромно значение за цялото човечество и за запазването на природата на нашата
планета.
Експериментът
продължава за неограничен период от време. 
За да се проведе
този експеримент е нужна финансова подкрепа.",2.0,0,"3 Campaigns

Haunted Heritage will tell the story of York's gruesome and ghostly past using interviews with historians and witnesses of alleged paranormal activity. Some post production effects and docudrama elements will also be included to heighten the entertainment aspect and draw the viewer in.  


Made Television - a UK television network with four stations - has agreed to broadcast the series.


The pilot episode will be approximately 25 minutes long and will be devoted to the Romans occupation of York. We'll be visiting the Treasurer's House where Harry Martindale witnessed a troop of Roman soldiers in a cellar in the 1950's. We'll also visit the Roman Fortress Baths, the scene of further ghostly Roman activity. The episode will feature interviews with experts on York's Roman past, include little known facts about the Romans as well as re-enactments of the ghostly events allegedly witnessed in both locations.

<p>After struggling with years of severe depression, Mark has decided that today is the day to end his misery. There is no moral or spiritual philosophy that can bring about Mark’s salvation and convince him that suicide is not the most pragmatic choice to make. Driven by this hard, cold logic he decides to cut himself off from those around him and tries to take his life, but no matter how he tries to accomplish his task, life gets in the way. Throughout his journey, many would-be saviors attempt to convince him that life does in fact have meaning and is worth living. Can any of them get through to Mark and change his mind?</p>

<p><i>What makes life worth living? Do meaning and value actually exist and if they do, who determines their definitions? Does belief in an afterlife, a god, or a spiritual system really provide solutions to our most desperate questions? </i></p>
<p>These are all concepts I set out to explore in <i>All Too Human</i>. These are important questions that nearly everyone asks at some point in their lives. The typical answers to these questions that religion offers don't suffice for those of us who don't value faith or are skeptical of the claims religion makes. So what's the alternative?</p>
<p>It is here that<i> All Too Human</i> finds its purpose: to direct the audience’s attention toward reality, to encourage a confrontation with life and to examine our perceptions of life's value without relying on faith or hope for something that may never come; to be at ease with living for ourselves, because we <i>want</i> to live, not because we have to.</p>

<div>""Hospice"" Gives to Hospice. We're excited to announce that we have partnered

go to benefit the Citrus Valley Hospice in Los Angeles.  Several of the producers involved with this project have first hand experience, and recognize the importance with caring for the elderly during the last stages of their lives, when

</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>Making a low budget independent film is very challenging. Making a low budget independent film with intense stunts and action sequences is bordering on insane. But we are able to make it happen for a few reason. 1) Each member of Engenius Productions brings resources to the project that others would have to pay tens of thousands for. 2) A cast of highly trained actors that are all capable and eager to perform their own stunts. 3) A first rate cinematographer in Steven Priovolos. 4) Director Jared Bentley's father, Gary Bentley did Special Effects in the industry for 35 years, And while he is gone now, many of his associates have come on board to make sure that the action sequences in this film will be something to remember.<br/>

<br/><br/> <p><strong>MY STORY</strong></p>
<p>Thomas Dean Zelios - Writer/Director</p> <p><i>When the Smoke Fumes</i> is a very personal story for me. Before moving to Florida when I was eight, I lived in Staten Island, New York. In this borough, nearly everyone’s father is a firefighter or a cop, including my own. My father, Thomas A. Zelios served as a firefighter based in Brooklyn for over twenty years. I specifically remember going to his station, Engine 242, seeing all the guys eating and shooting the s**t, guys being called to action zooming down the fireman’s pole, trucks racing out the giant red garage door. I also remember being taken to Christmas parties in some random basement held by fellow firefighters. Santa was there every year; they had music, food, magicians, you name it.</p> <p>The school I attended pre-k at sat on top of a hill, and from this hill you can see the entire landscape of downtown Manhattan. My mother used to work directly across the street from the World Trade Center, eventually being moved to a different building a few blocks away. Every day, when my father was dropping me off at school, I would point at the sky-scraping towers and say “it’s mommy’s building!” They were massive. From the viewpoint I had on top of that hill, they were annoyingly in your face.</p> <p>One day, a very normal day, my father took me to pre-k, as usual. He parked the car on top of that hill around the corner from the school. We got out of the car, walked around, and screaming at us right in front of our faces was a site we still haven’t gotten over to this day: the World Trade Center was on fire. I don’t remember anything else from this day. Only this moment. I remember looking up at my dad’s face and seeing nothing but pure shock. I couldn’t even tell you if I went to school that day. My father was eventually called to action, not as a first responder. He didn’t reach the towers until they had already fallen. There, he was able to grab a piece of rubble and take it home with him as an artifact. A piece of the World Trade Center sits in our living room to this day.</p> <p>The events of 9/11 have meant a lot of my family and I over the years. As a filmmaker and a storyteller, I’ve always wanted to show a side of this event that has never been shown. Shift the focus over and shine the light on unseen darkness. As a Florida resident and student, I wanted to be able to tell a 9/11 story in the most minuscule way possible without having to leave the state or even the city of Orlando. After some intense brainstorming, <i>When the Smoke Fumes</i> was born. A story about the wife of a fallen firefighter set entirely in the house they live in.</p> <p><strong>THE PLAN</strong></p>
<p>Many short films tend to be scenes from an extended feature film or even just a shortened version of one. I, however, like to view short films as their own storytelling medium and method of self-expression.</p> <p><i>When the Smoke Fumes</i> will be made to hopefully spark future projects my peers and I have prepared. We hope this will be a launching pad to expand our names, talents, and passions. Short films are meant to provoke emotion and to feel something you otherwise wouldn’t feel in a full-length feature. It’s an independent artform.</p> <p>I also set out to tell stories with unconventional plotlines and perspectives. I feel the expansion and broadness of visual storytelling as a whole needs a major reshaping and this is my first step of expressing that.</p> <p><strong>YOUR CONTRIBUTION</strong></p>
<p>Obviously, we will need money. Making a short film is very challenging and has many trials and tribulations throughout the entire process. Through a film celebration (a festival without awards) we hold every year at Valencia College we have already raised $600 for this film. Our goal is to give this project another $2000 to pay off the rest of the following:</p> <p><strong>Locations - $500</strong> - This entire film is set inside of a home. Although it is just one location, finding, funding, and securing a home can be very difficult, mainly since we will likely be filming inside of the home that someone lives in. This amount of money is around the average we would need to rent out a house for three days in/around Orlando, FL.</p> <p><strong>Food - $250</strong> - We have to feed the crew. This might be the most important use of our budget. At the moment, we plan on getting food donated for us for our daily lunch breaks. The $250 we need would solely be used for snacks, drinks, and coffee for the crew throughout the day before and after break.</p> <p><strong>Actors - $1000</strong> - We want to be able to pay our actors! Since the entire crew is made up of students and they are kindly volunteering their time and lives to be a part of this production, we at least have to do our talents justice by giving them a paycheck at the end of each day of principal photography.</p> <p><strong>Music - $150</strong> - We have fired a film composer, a friend of the producer, to create the score for the film. He needs to eat too!</p> <p><strong>Production Design - $400</strong> - This short film is very heavy on the production design as we are attempting to recreate a New York home inside of an Orlando residence. This will include art-related items/dressing such as: furniture, paint, wardrobe, props, etc.</p> <p><strong>Festivals - $500</strong> - The end game is to submit and compete at festivals around the state of Florida and the country as a whole. Most festivals require a fee to submit. $500 is a solid rate solely raised for festivals, with the rest of the leftover funding (if any) being used for submissions as well.</p> <p><strong>Total: $2800</strong></p>
<p><strong>Indiegogo total: $2200</strong></p>
<br/><br/> <p>If you are reading this</p> <p>I, Thomas, (director) and Jianthonnie (producer) couldn’t thank you enough!</p> <p>Even if you don’t donate, your interest means the world to us.</p> <p>-TZ &amp; JR</p>

 STRAIGHT TO THE POINT
This is a student film. We are poor, starving, and depressed. Help us. Please. I’m kidding. I’m not the one to beg. However, since this is a student-produced film, our money and resources are very limited. This is where you come in. With the help and support of backers, we, together, can create something special and worth remembering. WHEN THE SMOKE FUMES
Set in early 2000s New York, Emma struggles with the sudden death of her husband Frank, an FDNY firefighter. This is a different side to a story that is reminded to us at least once a year: the events of 9/11/01. Instead of showing the heroics of a firefighter in action, or the PTSD of one after-the-fact, this story shows the perspective that isn’t quite shown in film as the main plotpoint. When the Smoke Fumes tells the story of the wife of a firefighter who died during the attack of the World Trade Center.  How does a wife, a lover, a friend, a mother deal with such a sudden and tragic event? How can a normal, beautiful day quickly turn into something frightening and heartbreaking? One of the main themes portrayed is that every day is a new day. All of the main events of this story take place bright and early in the morning, the beginning of the day.
 
This story is even more so a story about family and moving forward in a harsh world than it is about 9/11 and even firefighting itself. I hope that this story captures that and the little things that make life beautiful and horrifying all at the same time.

Although it is just one location, finding, funding, and securing a home can be very difficult, mainly since we will likely be filming inside of the home that someone lives in. This amount of money is around the average we would need to rent out a house for three days in/around Orlando, FL. Food - $250 - We have to feed the crew. This might be the most important use of our budget. At the moment, we plan on getting food donated for us for our daily lunch breaks. The $250 we need would solely be used for snacks, drinks, and coffee for the crew throughout the day before and after break. Actors - $1000 - We want to be able to pay our actors! Since the entire crew is made up of students and they are kindly volunteering their time and lives to be a part of this production, we at least have to do our talents justice by giving them a paycheck at the end of each day of principal photography. Music - $150 - We have fired a film composer, a friend of the producer, to create the score for the film. He needs to eat too! Production Design - $400 - This short film is very heavy on the production design as we are attempting to recreate a New York home inside of an Orlando residence. This will include art-related items/dressing such as: furniture, paint, wardrobe, props, etc. Festivals - $500 - The end game is to submit and compete at festivals around the state of Florida and the country as a whole. Most festivals require a fee to submit. $500 is a solid rate solely raised for festivals, with the rest of the leftover funding (if any) being used for submissions as well. Total: $2800
Indiegogo total: $2200
 If you are reading this I, Thomas, (director) and Jianthonnie (producer) couldn’t thank you enough! Even if you don’t donate, your interest means the world to us. -TZ & JR",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

So we teamed up with our friend and talented screenwriter Emil Oscar. Now, six months later, we have developed an amazing story on the subject of loneliness and social isolation in an individualized world. It’s a huge problem in our society and a theme that we really care about. Therefore we really think this film can be a positive influence and make a difference.</p><p>Despite the dark theme, Moodtalk is an easy-going and tragically comical story about friendship in a individualistic future Stockholm. We believe in a feel-good film that will give the audience a sense of hopefulness. For that we really need your help to make this film come true. It’s our intention to submit the film to the major film festivals for short films in 2020.</p><p> </p><h2>THE STORY</h2><p>Loneliness has become a natural state in a individualistic future Stockholm. The modernization has resulted in a society in which we no longer feel any connection with our fellow human beings. The need of emotional validation and the importance of being seen, however, is still a human necessity and has been replaced by Moodtalk; A telephone service which provides you with a telephone friend, a moodbuddy, who cheers you on and gives you the appreciation you need. Moodtalk is now the common substitute for friendship and relationships. With Moodtalk you are never alone; you are just a tap away from being able to talk to a friend.</p><p>Adelia works as moodbuddy and has through her conversations with lonely people developed a dark and cynical view of the outside world. She finds no value in investing in relationships. Everything she needs, including work, can be found in her home. Among all the lonely customers, there is one who stands out from the crowd; Clara. She is easy going and has a positive view of the world and everything around her. Her problem is her denial of her loneliness and of the fact that her colleagues might not be her friends. Clara’s naive view of her ""friends"" and positivity provokes Adelia and one day, an inappropriate suggestion slips out during a moodtalk with Clara. A suggestion which forces her outside her comfort zone to make things right with Clara...</p><p> </p><h2>WHAT WE NEED</h2><p>It's expensive to make a short film.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>""Girl Beast"" is a short drama/horror film about Aubrey, an awkward 12-year-old girl who struggles with fitting in with the cool girls at her school. After embarrassing herself playing Truth-or-Dare, Aubrey is left alone and is attacked, bitten by a wolf. Her body starts to change in unexpected ways... body hair... fangs... a strange desire to eat the class pet... But through this supernatural puberty, her journey culminates into a greater understanding that the real enemy at school isn't the other girls, but an evil man among them. </p>
<p>""Girl Beast"" is almost complete, but we need funds to compensate for post-production, reimburse production fees, and help us with festival entry and promotion. </p>
<p>This film was made with an indie teeny tiny budget with an incredibly hardworking crew-- half of which were students or recent grads from FSU. We all worked really hard on it, we just want it to be as good as it can and have a chance at being played at festivals!</p>

<h3>Who Are You?</h3>
<p>My name is Anthony Canet Jr. and I am the writer/director of the short film ""From Heart to Pen"". I am a current Valencia College student enrolled in the Film Production Technology program and I, along with my classmates, will be graduating in July of this year.</p>
<h3>What is the Story About?</h3>
<p>From Heart to Pen follows Penny, a 10 year old girl who spends her days reading and writing. Her overactive imagination brings her characters to life and they provide a welcome reprieve from the worries Penny has about her parent's marriage. However, as the story goes along we see the real world problems Penny avoids begin to seep into her own writing.</p>
<p>As a child I loved to read and my parents divorced while I was still in High School so unsurprisingly there is a lot of ""me"" in the narrative. The biggest thing I wanted to get across in the film was the importance of communication between adults and children as well as the power of the written word. The only thing better than experiencing a really good tale is sharing it with someone else.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Films are expensive. Through school funding we have raised about 600$ for this specific short but unfortunately that will only cover the bare minimum. Luckily we have equipment and a crew but we'd like to be able to cover additional costs. For example, we might use funds for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buying catering that meets dietary restrictions.</li>
<li>Paying for locations:The film's locations include a family home and a hotel.</li>
<li>Supplying our art department with any materials they need for building and creating wonderful sets.</li>
<li>Paying talent: we'd like to compensate our actors for their time and dedication to the project.</li>
<li>Miscellaneous  expensiveness: Expendable equipment, gas, promotional materials, festival fees</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;""><b>​</b></span><span style=""font-size: 24px;""><b>Why Should I help?</b></span></p>
<p>This film is a fantastic opportunity for so many besides myself. It allows Valencia students the ability to work on a production that is created, produced,  and directed by fellow students. This unique opportunity to learn and practice the craft of film making is what produces the next generations of storytellers. The same goes for our amazing cast who will be able to use the film as a way to strive for bigger and better goals. I am so excited thinking about what the film will turn out to be but I'm even happier knowing that everyone working on it truly wants to be here and will become better artists for it. The story  I want to tell is as near and dear to my heart as the people helping me bring it to life.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help (Eg: I'm broke)</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that's okay!</p>
<ul>
<li>Share this campaign on social media. Just sending the link to the vimeo and this page can do a lot for publicity.</li>
<li>Know anyone in the Central Florida area who could help? We are currently looking for cheap/free locations, catering, equipment and anything else that  could help.</li>
<li>Send a message of encouragement. If you enjoyed my pitch or just really want to see the final product, send a message and I'll be sure to share it with my crew for a morale boost.</li>
</ul>

Films are expensive. Through school funding we have raised about 600$ for this specific short but unfortunately that will only cover the bare minimum. Luckily we have equipment and a crew but we'd like to be able to cover additional costs. For example, we might use funds for:

Buying catering that meets dietary restrictions.
Paying for locations:The film's locations include a family home and a hotel.
Supplying our art department with any materials they need for building and creating wonderful sets.
Paying talent: we'd like to compensate our actors for their time and dedication to the project.
Miscellaneous  expensiveness: Expendable equipment, gas, promotional materials, festival fees

​Why Should I help?
This film is a fantastic opportunity for so many besides myself. It allows Valencia students the ability to work on a production that is created, produced,  and directed by fellow students. This unique opportunity to learn and practice the craft of film making is what produces the next generations of storytellers. The same goes for our amazing cast who will be able to use the film as a way to strive for bigger and better goals. I am so excited thinking about what the film will turn out to be but I'm even happier knowing that everyone working on it truly wants to be here and will become better artists for it. The story  I want to tell is as near and dear to my heart as the people helping me bring it to life.

Other Ways You Can Help (Eg: I'm broke)
Some people just can't contribute, but that's okay!

Share this campaign on social media. Just sending the link to the vimeo and this page can do a lot for publicity.
Know anyone in the Central Florida area who could help? We are currently looking for cheap/free locations, catering, equipment and anything else that  could help.
Send a message of encouragement. If you enjoyed my pitch or just really want to see the final product, send a message and I'll be sure to share it with my crew for a morale boost.

If you're reading this, thank you! Whether or not we get the extra funds I hope you enjoyed seeing what we have to offer. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns please feel free to make your voice heard. Have a great day!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>On the occasion of the 80th anniversary of the Second World War in 2020, OREADIS Productions invites you to discover through film a part of the history of France that is unknown to the general public... In June 1940, the Battle of the Alps pitted France against Italy.<br/>This film entitled ""Two weeks of June"" will be directed by Jocelyn TRUCHET, former soldier of the French army. We need you to carry it out successfully.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>EN BREF / IN SUMMARY</strong></u></h2>
<p>OREADIS Productions souhaite contribuer au devoir de transmission de l’Histoire de France en soutenant un projet cinématographique à caractère historique au format court-métrage (env 20 minutes).</p>
<p>En suivant les troupes postées en Maurienne (Savoie, France), juste à la frontière de l’Italie, le film « <i>Deux semaines de juin</i> » met en lumière « <strong>La bataille des Alpes</strong> », opposant en juin 1940 la France à l’Italie, notamment sur les communes de Valloire et Valmeinier.</p>
<p>Une bataille dont on ne traite pas dans les livres scolaires et que l’on retrouve que dans de trop rares livres d’Histoire de niche.</p>
<p>« <i>Deux semaines de juin</i> » est un projet porté par 2 enfants du pays : <strong>Jocelyn TRUCHET</strong> (auteur-réalisateur), <strong>Séverine MELCHIORRE</strong> (productrice et présidente de la société OREADIS Productions).</p>
<ul>
<li>« <i>Deux semaines de juin</i> » est <strong>un questionnemen</strong>t sur les choix que l’on est amené à faire en cas de conflit.</li>
<li>« <i>Deux semaines de juin</i> » a pour ambition de <strong>mettre en valeur la Maurienne</strong> par sa capacité d’unir ses habitants, ses entreprises, ses associations et ses collectivités locales autour d’un projet artistique.</li>
<li>« <i>Deux semaines de juin</i> » devra relever un <strong>défi technique et logistique</strong> : tourner la majeure partie du film en montagne, en décor réel, loin des accès routiers et des habitations, afin de rester le plus fidèle à ce qu’ont vécu à l’époque les soldats français et italiens qui se sont affrontés.</li>
</ul>
<p>C’est la raison pour laquelle nous vous proposons de rejoindre l’aventure et de nous soutenir financièrement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>OREADIS Productions wishes to plays its part in transmitting the history of France by supporting a historical short film project (approx. 20 minutes long).</p>
<p>As it follows the troops deployed in Maurienne (a province of Savoy in France), just on the border of Italy, the film ""Two weeks of June"" highlights ""<strong>The Battle of the Alps</strong>"", which pitted France against Italy in June 1940, especially in the communes of Valloire and Valmeinier.</p>
<p>This is a battle that is not discussed in school books and that can be found only in those all-too-rare books dealing with niche history.</p>
<p>“Two weeks of June"" is a project led by 2 people who grew up in the Maurienne:  <strong>Mr Jocelyn TRUCHET </strong>(writer and director), <strong>Ms Séverine MELCHIORRE</strong> (producer and president of the company OREADIS Productions).</p>
<ul>
<li>“Two weeks of June"" is <strong>an examination of</strong> the choices that have to be made in a conflict.</li>
<li>“Two weeks of June"" aims<strong> to highlight the Maurienne</strong> through its ability to unite residents, companies, associations and local communities around an artistic project.</li>
<li>“Two weeks of June"" will have <strong>a technical and logistical challenge to meet</strong>: shooting most of the film in the mountains, in real scenery, far from accessible roads and houses, in order to remain as faithful as possible to the experience of the French and Italian soldiers of the time as they confronted each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is why we would like to suggest that you join the adventure and provide financial support for the project.</p>

<h3>Résumé du film / Film synopsis</h3>
<p>10 juin 1940 sur la ligne de front franco-italienne ; L’angoisse, l’attente et le doute quant à l’issue du combat pèsent sur le Sergent MARTIN et son unité. Le conflit ne porterait-il pas aussi sur le sens du devoir du soldat et la conscience de chaque homme ?</p>
<p>The tenth of June 1940, on the Franco-Italian front line; the anxiety, the wait and the doubt as to the outcome of the battle weigh on Sergeant MARTIN and his unit. Might not the conflict also intrude on a soldier’s sense of duty and on the conscience of each man?</p>

<h3>Intention de Jocelyn / Jocelyn’s take </h3>
<p>Le thème principal de ce film historique est la première bataille des Alpes, oubliée des livres d’histoire, qui fut pourtant une victoire au milieu de la défaite de 1940. En suivant les hommes du Sergent MARTIN, on arrive à plonger avec eux dans ce qu’ils ressentent et comment ils font face. Mais plus encore que le thème historique, le film permet de réfléchir sur les choix que nous devons faire en tant que citoyen et père pour l’avenir de nos enfants.</p>
<p>The main theme of this historical film is the first Battle of the Alps - forgotten by the history books - which was a victory in the midst of the defeat of 1940. By following Sergeant MARTIN’s men, we’re able to delve into what they feel and how they cope. But beyond the historical theme, the film examines the choices we must make as citizens and parents for the future of our children.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Avec ce film <strong>je désire restaurer l'image du soldat français de 1940 </strong>qui, pour beaucoup, reste un soldat qui ne s'est pas battu, qui n'a fait que se replier face aux allemands. Ce qui est faux ! En 6 semaines de combats entre le 10 mai et le 22 juin 1940, presque 100 000 soldats ont perdu la vie en combattant. De plus, sur toute la frontière des Alpes face aux italiens, largement inférieurs en nombre, ce fut une victoire qui arrêta l'armée italienne du massif du Mont Blanc à la mer Méditerranée. Je suis particulièrement touché par l'histoire de ce film, car très attaché à l'histoire de ma vallée, mais aussi parce que mon grand-père s'est battu lui aussi pour la France aux côtés de ces hommes, à quelques kilomètres du lieu du film dans les rangs du 81 BAF.</p>
<p>Through this film, <strong>I want to help restore the image of the French soldier of 1940</strong> who, for many people, remains a soldier who did not fight, but who only retreated from the Germans. Which is wrong! In six weeks of fighting between 10 May and 22 June, 1940, nearly 100,000 soldiers lost their lives. In addition, against the Italians, and largely inferior in number, they scored a victory that stopped the Italian army along the entire Alpine border from the Mont Blanc Massif to the Mediterranean Sea. I’m particularly touched by the story of the film, because I’m very attached to the history of my valley, but also because my grandfather fought for France alongside these men in the ranks of 81st French Alpine Fortress Battalion, a few kilometres from where we’re making the film.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Je voudrais aussi que ce film<strong> permette de se poser quelques questions</strong>. Et si maintenant la même chose se produisait ? Qu'est ce qui est le plus important : sa famille, la défense de son pays ? Est-ce que se battre pour son pays et mourir pour lui a un sens ? Comment ont réagi ces personnes, pourquoi ont-elles été si combatives même si la situation générale de l'armée française semblait dramatique ?</p>
<p>I’d like this film to be an <strong>enabling one that allows us to ask questions</strong>. What if the same thing happened now? What is more important: one’s family, or the defence of ones’ country? Does fighting for one’s country and dying for it make sense? How did these people react, why were they so combative even though the general situation of the French army appeared hopeless?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Enfin, pour moi, au-delà d’être un magnifique décor,<strong> la montagne est un personnage du film</strong>, elle est belle mais peut tout aussi devenir meurtrière (exemple : les soldats italiens morts gélés). Elle est paisible sans un bruit lorsque l'on monte la garde, mais s'embrase tout d'un coup avec les tirs d'artillerie, l'écho amplifiant les explosions. Et finalement elle demeure neutre, car elle impose les mêmes adversités de froid, de mauvais temps que l'on soit français ou italien. Elle contemple la folie des hommes qui s’entre-tuent pour la posséder. Et c'est la même montagne qui contemplera notre tournage 79 ans après ces combats.</p>
<p>Lastly, for me, beyond being a beautiful setting, <strong>the mountain is a character of the film</strong>. It is beautiful but it can also become murderous (for example, the Italian soldiers freezing to death). It is peaceful without a sound while you are standing guard, but then it suddenly flares up with artillery fire, and the explosions are amplified by echoes. And finally, it remains neutral, because it inflicts the same hardships of cold and bad weather on French and Italian alike. It contemplates the madness of men who are killing each other in order to possess it. And it is the same mountain that will contemplate the shooting of our film 79 years after the fighting.</p>

<h3><strong>About Séverine MELCHIORRE, Producer</strong></h3>
<p>Après 10 années d’expérience dans l’univers de la communication, de l’audiovisuel et du cinéma, Séverine MELCHIORRE a souhaité évoluer vers un univers fidèle à ses valeurs et sa passion afin d’agir en tant que productrice.</p>
<p>After 10 years of experience in the world of communication, audio-visual and cinema, Séverine MELCHIORRE wanted to move on to a job that reflected her values and enthusiasm as a producer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>En l’occurrence : associer une vision humaine et pragmatique de la gestion de projet à une dimension créatrice respectueuse des contraintes économiques et structurelles.</p>
<p>In this case, that meant combining a humane and pragmatic vision of project management with a creative dimension that respected economic and structural constraints.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Créer sa société de production est dès lors devenue une évidence afin d’œuvrer libérée de ces contraintes en vue <strong>d’accompagner ses artistes de manière personnalisée et souple</strong> dans leurs projets audiovisuels, cinématographiques, culturels, de communication ou encore de divertissement.</p>
<p>Creating a production company was an obvious next step in order to work, free from these constraints, and <strong>provide personalised and flexible guidance and support to the artists</strong> in their audio-visual, film, cultural, communication and entertainment projects.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Intention de Séverine / Séverine’s take</h3>
<p><u>Une ambition pédagogique et de mémoire / Educational and remembrance goals</u></p>
<p>Originaire de la Maurienne et issue d’une famille franco-italienne, j’ai été tout de suite interpellée par le sujet dont je n’avais jamais entendu parler. Il est vrai que ce que l’on nous enseigne à l’école concernant les deux Grandes Guerres repose essentiellement sur Verdun, la bataille de la Marne ou encore le débarquement en Normandie, sans oublier le massacre des populations de confession juive et le mouvement de la résistance.</p>
<p>Originally from the Maurienne and from a Franco-Italian family, I was immediately drawn to the subject, which I’d never heard of. It’s true that what we are taught at school about both world wars is essentially based on Verdun, the Battle of the Marne or the Normandy landings, not to mention the massacre of Jewish populations and the resistance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>« La bataille des Alpes », où les territoires des 2 Savoie et des Alpes Maritimes étaient en jeu, est, elle, passée à la trappe des l ivres scolaires.</p>
<p>“The Battle of the Alps"", in which the territories of the two Savoys and the Maritime Alps were at stake, was overlooked by the school books.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>L’enjeu est donc de <strong>faire découvrir ou redécouvrir une partie de l’histoire de la Seconde Guerre mondiale</strong> avec un oeil et des éléments « nouveaux » au travers d’un film tout public, fruit d’un travail de recherches poussées (témoignages, documents d’archives, entretient avec l’historien Laurent DEMOUZON).</p>
<p>The challenge is therefore <strong>to discover or rediscover part of the history of the Second World War</strong> with fresh eyes and ""new"" elements through a film for the general public, the result of extensive research (testimonies, archival documents, interviews with an historian, Laurent DEMOUZON).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Il n’est pas question de faire un film de guerre où explosions, échanges de tirs et giclées de sang s’enchainent, mais plutôt d’être aux côtés des troupes qui se préparent et attendent que le combat arrive. Alors que les conditions ne sont pas favorables, les soldats sont excités par l’adrénaline, d’autres se questionnent sur la situation et leur mission de vie, quand soudain l’Armistice est annoncé. Comment reçoivent-ils la nouvelle alors que les troupes italiennes sont à portée de tir ?</p>
<p>There is no question of making a war movie where explosions, gun battles and blood splattering everywhere follow one after the other, but rather to be alongside the troops who are preparing and waiting for the fighting to begin. When conditions are unfavourable, some soldiers feel a rush of adrenaline, others wonder about the situation and their life mission, and suddenly the Armistice is announced. How do they feel about that news when the Italian troops are within firing range?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Au-delà d’une fiction de guerre, <strong>il s’agit d’une histoire de soldats racontée par un soldat</strong>. En effet, Jocelyn TRUCHET est un homme de combat qui, en tant que Sergent-Chef au 13e BCA (Bataillon des Chasseurs Alpins) de Chambéry, a connu l’ambiance de la guerre dans des conditions difficiles et qui maîtrise l’analyse des conflits. C’est un homme de défi, passionné d’histoire et plus particulièrement des conflits à travers l’Histoire. L’audiovisuel vers lequel il s’est tourné suite à sa blessure en Afghanistan lui donne l’opportunité de partager son amour de l’histoire militaire. </p>
<p>More than a war story, <strong>it’s a story about soldiers told by a soldier</strong>. Jocelyn TRUCHET is a man of action who, as the Staff Sergeant of the 13th BCA (a French Alpine Chasseur Battalion) of Chambéry, experienced the atmosphere of war under difficult conditions and fully understands how to analyse conflicts. He’s a man who likes challenges, who’s passionate about history and more specifically about conflicts throughout history. The audio-visual world which he turned to after his injury in Afghanistan gave him the opportunity to share his love of military history. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sa vision et sa sensibilité associées aux conseils de Laurent DEMOUZON (historien ayant effectué son service militaire au 13e BCA de Chambéry) permettent <strong>un travail minutieux et challengeant donnant du réalisme dans les dialogues et les situations.</strong></p>
<p>His vision and sensitivity together with the advice of Laurent DEMOUZON (a historian who did his military service with the 13th BCA Chambéry) makes for a <strong>meticulous and challenging work, giving realism to the dialogues and situations.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Le parcours de Jocelyn et son goût du défi m’ont persuadée de <strong>son sérieux dans l’investissement pour un tel projet</strong>. J’estime être honorée par sa confiance et c’est avec détermination que je l’accompagne depuis 2016 afin de mettre en image son premier film à caractère cinématographique.</p>
<p>Jocelyn's career and his taste for challenge convinced me that he was <strong>serious about investing in such a project</strong>. I feel honoured by his trust and I’ve been working with him with great determination since 2016 to get the images of his first cinematographic work onto film.</p>

</div></div>","On the occasion of the 80th anniversary of the Second World War in 2020, OREADIS Productions invites you to discover through film a part of the history of France that is unknown to the general public... In June 1940, the Battle of the Alps pitted France against Italy.This film entitled ""Two weeks of June"" will be directed by Jocelyn TRUCHET, former soldier of the French army. We need you to carry it out successfully.
 
EN BREF / IN SUMMARY
OREADIS Productions souhaite contribuer au devoir de transmission de l’Histoire de France en soutenant un projet cinématographique à caractère historique au format court-métrage (env 20 minutes).
En suivant les troupes postées en Maurienne (Savoie, France), juste à la frontière de l’Italie, le film « Deux semaines de juin » met en lumière « La bataille des Alpes », opposant en juin 1940 la France à l’Italie, notamment sur les communes de Valloire et Valmeinier.
Une bataille dont on ne traite pas dans les livres scolaires et que l’on retrouve que dans de trop rares livres d’Histoire de niche.
« Deux semaines de juin » est un projet porté par 2 enfants du pays : Jocelyn TRUCHET (auteur-réalisateur), Séverine MELCHIORRE (productrice et présidente de la société OREADIS Productions).

« Deux semaines de juin » est un questionnement sur les choix que l’on est amené à faire en cas de conflit.
« Deux semaines de juin » a pour ambition de mettre en valeur la Maurienne par sa capacité d’unir ses habitants, ses entreprises, ses associations et ses collectivités locales autour d’un projet artistique.
« Deux semaines de juin » devra relever un défi technique et logistique : tourner la majeure partie du film en montagne, en décor réel, loin des accès routiers et des habitations, afin de rester le plus fidèle à ce qu’ont vécu à l’époque les soldats français et italiens qui se sont affrontés.

C’est la raison pour laquelle nous vous proposons de rejoindre l’aventure et de nous soutenir financièrement.
 
OREADIS Productions wishes to plays its part in transmitting the history of France by supporting a historical short film project (approx. 20 minutes long).
As it follows the troops deployed in Maurienne (a province of Savoy in France), just on the border of Italy, the film ""Two weeks of June"" highlights ""The Battle of the Alps"", which pitted France against Italy in June 1940, especially in the communes of Valloire and Valmeinier.
This is a battle that is not discussed in school books and that can be found only in those all-too-rare books dealing with niche history.
“Two weeks of June"" is a project led by 2 people who grew up in the Maurienne:  Mr Jocelyn TRUCHET (writer and director), Ms Séverine MELCHIORRE (producer and president of the company OREADIS Productions).

“Two weeks of June"" is an examination of the choices that have to be made in a conflict.
“Two weeks of June"" aims to highlight the Maurienne through its ability to unite residents, companies, associations and local communities around an artistic project.
“Two weeks of June"" will have a technical and logistical challenge to meet: shooting most of the film in the mountains, in real scenery, far from accessible roads and houses, in order to remain as faithful as possible to the experience of the French and Italian soldiers of the time as they confronted each other.

That is why we would like to suggest that you join the adventure and provide financial support for the project.
 
Résumé du film / Film synopsis
10 juin 1940 sur la ligne de front franco-italienne ; L’angoisse, l’attente et le doute quant à l’issue du combat pèsent sur le Sergent MARTIN et son unité. Le conflit ne porterait-il pas aussi sur le sens du devoir du soldat et la conscience de chaque homme ?
The tenth of June 1940, on the Franco-Italian front line; the anxiety, the wait and the doubt as to the outcome of the battle weigh on Sergeant MARTIN and his unit. Might not the conflict also intrude on a soldier’s sense of duty and on the conscience of each man?
 

A propos de Jocelyn TRUCHET, l'auteur-réalisateur / 
About Jocelyn TRUCHET, writer and director
Après une première partie de carrière militaire en tant que combattant, et suite à une blessure, le Sergent-Chef Jocelyn TRUCHET s’est réorienté dans l’audiovisuel.
Staff Sergeant Jocelyn TRUCHET spent the first part of his military career as a soldier. Following an injury, he changed for a career in the audio-visual field.

Intention de Jocelyn / Jocelyn’s take 
Le thème principal de ce film historique est la première bataille des Alpes, oubliée des livres d’histoire, qui fut pourtant une victoire au milieu de la défaite de 1940. En suivant les hommes du Sergent MARTIN, on arrive à plonger avec eux dans ce qu’ils ressentent et comment ils font face. Mais plus encore que le thème historique, le film permet de réfléchir sur les choix que nous devons faire en tant que citoyen et père pour l’avenir de nos enfants.
The main theme of this historical film is the first Battle of the Alps - forgotten by the history books - which was a victory in the midst of the defeat of 1940. By following Sergeant MARTIN’s men, we’re able to delve into what they feel and how they cope. But beyond the historical theme, the film examines the choices we must make as citizens and parents for the future of our children.
 
Avec ce film je désire restaurer l'image du soldat français de 1940 qui, pour beaucoup, reste un soldat qui ne s'est pas battu, qui n'a fait que se replier face aux allemands. Ce qui est faux ! En 6 semaines de combats entre le 10 mai et le 22 juin 1940, presque 100 000 soldats ont perdu la vie en combattant. De plus, sur toute la frontière des Alpes face aux italiens, largement inférieurs en nombre, ce fut une victoire qui arrêta l'armée italienne du massif du Mont Blanc à la mer Méditerranée. Je suis particulièrement touché par l'histoire de ce film, car très attaché à l'histoire de ma vallée, mais aussi parce que mon grand-père s'est battu lui aussi pour la France aux côtés de ces hommes, à quelques kilomètres du lieu du film dans les rangs du 81 BAF.
Through this film, I want to help restore the image of the French soldier of 1940 who, for many people, remains a soldier who did not fight, but who only retreated from the Germans. Which is wrong! In six weeks of fighting between 10 May and 22 June, 1940, nearly 100,000 soldiers lost their lives. In addition, against the Italians, and largely inferior in number, they scored a victory that stopped the Italian army along the entire Alpine border from the Mont Blanc Massif to the Mediterranean Sea. I’m particularly touched by the story of the film, because I’m very attached to the history of my valley, but also because my grandfather fought for France alongside these men in the ranks of 81st French Alpine Fortress Battalion, a few kilometres from where we’re making the film.
 
Je voudrais aussi que ce film permette de se poser quelques questions. Et si maintenant la même chose se produisait ? Qu'est ce qui est le plus important : sa famille, la défense de son pays ? Est-ce que se battre pour son pays et mourir pour lui a un sens ? Comment ont réagi ces personnes, pourquoi ont-elles été si combatives même si la situation générale de l'armée française semblait dramatique ?
I’d like this film to be an enabling one that allows us to ask questions. What if the same thing happened now? What is more important: one’s family, or the defence of ones’ country? Does fighting for one’s country and dying for it make sense? How did these people react, why were they so combative even though the general situation of the French army appeared hopeless?
 
Enfin, pour moi, au-delà d’être un magnifique décor, la montagne est un personnage du film, elle est belle mais peut tout aussi devenir meurtrière (exemple : les soldats italiens morts gélés). Elle est paisible sans un bruit lorsque l'on monte la garde, mais s'embrase tout d'un coup avec les tirs d'artillerie, l'écho amplifiant les explosions. Et finalement elle demeure neutre, car elle impose les mêmes adversités de froid, de mauvais temps que l'on soit français ou italien. Elle contemple la folie des hommes qui s’entre-tuent pour la posséder. Et c'est la même montagne qui contemplera notre tournage 79 ans après ces combats.
Lastly, for me, beyond being a beautiful setting, the mountain is a character of the film. It is beautiful but it can also become murderous (for example, the Italian soldiers freezing to death). It is peaceful without a sound while you are standing guard, but then it suddenly flares up with artillery fire, and the explosions are amplified by echoes. And finally, it remains neutral, because it inflicts the same hardships of cold and bad weather on French and Italian alike. It contemplates the madness of men who are killing each other in order to possess it. And it is the same mountain that will contemplate the shooting of our film 79 years after the fighting.
 
A propos de Séverine MELCHIORRE, Productrice /
About Séverine MELCHIORRE, Producer
Après 10 années d’expérience dans l’univers de la communication, de l’audiovisuel et du cinéma, Séverine MELCHIORRE a souhaité évoluer vers un univers fidèle à ses valeurs et sa passion afin d’agir en tant que productrice.
After 10 years of experience in the world of communication, audio-visual and cinema, Séverine MELCHIORRE wanted to move on to a job that reflected her values and enthusiasm as a producer.
 
En l’occurrence : associer une vision humaine et pragmatique de la gestion de projet à une dimension créatrice respectueuse des contraintes économiques et structurelles.
In this case, that meant combining a humane and pragmatic vision of project management with a creative dimension that respected economic and structural constraints.
 
Créer sa société de production est dès lors devenue une évidence afin d’œuvrer libérée de ces contraintes en vue d’accompagner ses artistes de manière personnalisée et souple dans leurs projets audiovisuels, cinématographiques, culturels, de communication ou encore de divertissement.
Creating a production company was an obvious next step in order to work, free from these constraints, and provide personalised and flexible guidance and support to the artists in their audio-visual, film, cultural, communication and entertainment projects.
 
Intention de Séverine / Séverine’s take
Une ambition pédagogique et de mémoire / Educational and remembrance goals
Originaire de la Maurienne et issue d’une famille franco-italienne, j’ai été tout de suite interpellée par le sujet dont je n’avais jamais entendu parler. Il est vrai que ce que l’on nous enseigne à l’école concernant les deux Grandes Guerres repose essentiellement sur Verdun, la bataille de la Marne ou encore le débarquement en Normandie, sans oublier le massacre des populations de confession juive et le mouvement de la résistance.
Originally from the Maurienne and from a Franco-Italian family, I was immediately drawn to the subject, which I’d never heard of. It’s true that what we are taught at school about both world wars is essentially based on Verdun, the Battle of the Marne or the Normandy landings, not to mention the massacre of Jewish populations and the resistance.
 
« La bataille des Alpes », où les territoires des 2 Savoie et des Alpes Maritimes étaient en jeu, est, elle, passée à la trappe des l ivres scolaires.
“The Battle of the Alps"", in which the territories of the two Savoys and the Maritime Alps were at stake, was overlooked by the school books.
 
L’enjeu est donc de faire découvrir ou redécouvrir une partie de l’histoire de la Seconde Guerre mondiale avec un oeil et des éléments « nouveaux » au travers d’un film tout public, fruit d’un travail de recherches poussées (témoignages, documents d’archives, entretient avec l’historien Laurent DEMOUZON).
The challenge is therefore to discover or rediscover part of the history of the Second World War with fresh eyes and ""new"" elements through a film for the general public, the result of extensive research (testimonies, archival documents, interviews with an historian, Laurent DEMOUZON).
 
Il n’est pas question de faire un film de guerre où explosions, échanges de tirs et giclées de sang s’enchainent, mais plutôt d’être aux côtés des troupes qui se préparent et attendent que le combat arrive. Alors que les conditions ne sont pas favorables, les soldats sont excités par l’adrénaline, d’autres se questionnent sur la situation et leur mission de vie, quand soudain l’Armistice est annoncé. Comment reçoivent-ils la nouvelle alors que les troupes italiennes sont à portée de tir ?
There is no question of making a war movie where explosions, gun battles and blood splattering everywhere follow one after the other, but rather to be alongside the troops who are preparing and waiting for the fighting to begin. When conditions are unfavourable, some soldiers feel a rush of adrenaline, others wonder about the situation and their life mission, and suddenly the Armistice is announced. How do they feel about that news when the Italian troops are within firing range?
 
Au-delà d’une fiction de guerre, il s’agit d’une histoire de soldats racontée par un soldat. En effet, Jocelyn TRUCHET est un homme de combat qui, en tant que Sergent-Chef au 13e BCA (Bataillon des Chasseurs Alpins) de Chambéry, a connu l’ambiance de la guerre dans des conditions difficiles et qui maîtrise l’analyse des conflits. C’est un homme de défi, passionné d’histoire et plus particulièrement des conflits à travers l’Histoire. L’audiovisuel vers lequel il s’est tourné suite à sa blessure en Afghanistan lui donne l’opportunité de partager son amour de l’histoire militaire. 
More than a war story, it’s a story about soldiers told by a soldier. Jocelyn TRUCHET is a man of action who, as the Staff Sergeant of the 13th BCA (a French Alpine Chasseur Battalion) of Chambéry, experienced the atmosphere of war under difficult conditions and fully understands how to analyse conflicts. He’s a man who likes challenges, who’s passionate about history and more specifically about conflicts throughout history. The audio-visual world which he turned to after his injury in Afghanistan gave him the opportunity to share his love of military history. 
 
Sa vision et sa sensibilité associées aux conseils de Laurent DEMOUZON (historien ayant effectué son service militaire au 13e BCA de Chambéry) permettent un travail minutieux et challengeant donnant du réalisme dans les dialogues et les situations.
His vision and sensitivity together with the advice of Laurent DEMOUZON (a historian who did his military service with the 13th BCA Chambéry) makes for a meticulous and challenging work, giving realism to the dialogues and situations.
 
Le parcours de Jocelyn et son goût du défi m’ont persuadée de son sérieux dans l’investissement pour un tel projet. J’estime être honorée par sa confiance et c’est avec détermination que je l’accompagne depuis 2016 afin de mettre en image son premier film à caractère cinématographique.
Jocelyn's career and his taste for challenge convinced me that he was serious about investing in such a project. I feel honoured by his trust and I’ve been working with him with great determination since 2016 to get the images of his first cinematographic work onto film.

By participating in the funding, you will be taking part in an historical cultural and tourism project of some importance since it will enable the general public to (re)discover the region in a way they have never seen before.
To thank you according to the amount of your contribution you will:

all be featured in the film credits;
have access to the film on line
have the CD album of the soundtrack
receive the Blu-Ray of the film
receive an original Opinel knife with the film’s logo (limited edition)

 
Si la collecte dépasse notre objectif, et en fonction du montant final de la collecte, il nous sera alors possible, par exemple :

de développer plus de contenus bonus à intégrer dans le Blu-Ray ; 
de prévoir des évènements supplémentaires ;
offrir des affiches dédicacées du film ;
etc.

If the fund-raising exceeds our objective, and according to the final amount collected, it will then be possible for us, for example to:

develop more bonus content for the Blu-Ray; 
plan additional events;
offer autographed posters of the film;
etc.

 
Si au contraire nous n’atteignons pas l’objectif, en fonction du montant, la somme collectée nous permettra d’assurer certains frais du coût de production du film et nous poursuivrons la recherche de partenaires.
If, on the contrary, we do not reach the goal, the sum collected, depending on the amount, will allow us to cover certain of the film’s production costs, and we will continue the search for partners.

Le musée OPINEL / The OPINEL Museum
La famille OPINEL, originaire de la Maurienne, est la créatrice du fameux couteau OPINEL, et de nombreux autres articles de coutellerie, depuis près de 130 ans. 
Le couteau OPINEL est un incontournable et très utilisé par les soldats pendant les deux Grandes Guerres. Vous pourrez découvrir un exemplaire en action dans le film.
Il était pour nous logique de vous en offrir dans le cadre de notre collecte.

The OPINEL family, from Maurienne, has been the creator of the famous OPINEL knife, and many other cutlery items, for nearly 130 years. 
The OPINEL knife is a must and they were used a lot by the soldiers during the two world wars. You will see an example in action in the film.

<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>This film is particularly important for me as this will be the final significant piece of work that I produce at Royal Holloway University of London,  and will not only hold great significance in my final grade, but it will be a project that I will take great pleasure in producing as it will allow me to showcase my work and abilities as I proceed after. </p>
<p>This project will allow me to have some fun pushing my creative freedom to the max, in a monumental task of producing, directing and shooting this entire project myself and ultimately allow me to be proud of the film I've produced. </p>
<p>Any funds that you generously help me raise will benefit me in a vast number of ways, that range from sourcing cast and making sure they are comfortable, helping with transportation costs as well as lodging and prop sourcing. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>A large part of the funding will go on the cost of recruiting cast for the film and making sure they are looked after, supporting both their travelling and stay. Another smaller proportion of the funds will be used on the transportation of cast and equipment between London and the shooting locations. I've been very fortunate and I'm very thankful to have been given access to an excellent shooting location in Dorset, where in which the majority of the film will take place. This means that a proportion of these funds will be spent on the film's set design, making sure the locations are designed and decorated to perfectly fit the horror style of the film. </p>
<p>More importantly, these funds will all allow me to supply you all with a well polished and exciting (hopefully scary) film. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know the difference their contribution will make:</p>
<p>Initially, when undertaking this task I was given the option to work in a team, however, I decided I wanted to try and undertake this project as a lone wolf project, undertaking every element of it myself.  This means that this project is particularly important to me, and will stand to be an important example to any people who are thinking of producing a film themselves, showing that you don't need to be part of a corporate company, in order to produce a successful film.   </p>
<p>An important factor to note is that I've spent the last 3 years specialising in the study and development of cinematography, meaning that all that I've learnt in this course has been leading up to the production of this film and will hopefully display that to any potential employers. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>An initial challenge that springs to mind is the idea of time restraints, largely due to the fact that I am faced with the momentous task of creating an immersive and ambitious film, entirely undertaken by myself an extremely small crew of two. </p>
<p>However, through effective planning, and conscientious thinking I will ensure that the shoot goes exactly as planned, and follows a strict schedule in order to ensure that the shoot goes as smoothly as possible. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How you can help!</h3>
<p>Any help is deeply appreciated, even if you can't donate, any exposure that you can assist with is very useful. Whether this is sharing my campaign or telling friends and others about it via word of mouth.  </p>

 Our Director's name is Rachel Vaswani. She is born and raised in Indonesia. Born into an Indian family she has been raised with a set of morals and values that emphasize the extreme importance of family. She shares a close relationship with all family members especially her Mother.
On the 19th of August 2017, Miss Vaswani lost her mother. Ever since then she’s had to deal with grief in her own way. Ek Onkar is a way of moving forward and letting go.
Currently she has been an international student for five years now. She had studied in the UK. At the time of her Mother’s passing she had just started film school at the New York Film Academy in LA. She’s using the power of film in order to visually convey her grief in order to move forward.  Ria, an Indian raised in LA who is dealing with grief after the loss of her mother, questions God’s existence, only to have to relive what she went through in the hospital with her Mother.  In order to create a vision so unique as this - a story that has never been told before, one that will appeal to the masses, Miss Vaswani will need your help to finance the film. A grand story only deserves the best. Hence why Miss Vaswani is currently seeking your help in order to finance her film. Due to the toll her Mother’s passing has had on her family, she sees it unfit to seek financial help from her immediate family. That’s where you come in!

<h3>About the Writer/Director</h3>
<p>Hi to all!<br/>My name is Rachel Renee, a 29 year old, near future graduate of Los Angeles Film School. What got me into film production was not only my love for movies, but also my love for creation. My passion has always been telling stories either through words on a page or with pictures. When I realized I had the potential to bring my stories to life through film, I jumped at the opportunity. </p>
<p>My style of writing has developed into a combination of drama, thriller and sci-fi. What can I say...I love the weird and freaky stuff. I write stories that either make your head spin or make you question your worth as a human being. Hot topics for me are anything that has to do with our progress and/or failures as humans or the internal psyche and the troubles that plague us.</p>
<h3><strong>Adam's Ale the Move</strong></h3>
<p>Adam's Ale is dramatic thriller about a couple, Adam and Bernadette who are living in Los Angeles, year 2030. Due to severe draught across the nation many cities face tough restrictions and water is under strict government control. After Adam makes a rebellious mistake to use more than his share, the couple are put on probation, leaving them with the decision to stay in the city or risk crossing the vast and dangerous desert to find hope and a new home. </p>
<p>As stated in the overview of the project, I wrote Adam's Ale as a piece for advocating water conservation. Living in California as a transplant, I've come to realize how terrible the drought really is. Truthfully, the severity of the drought didn't hit me, until recently taking a trip across California. Many of the lakes are gone; most are mere swamps and mud puddles. Rivers have become dry rock beds. The sad part is that the drought is not only affecting Southern California, but many surrounding areas as well. The desert is growing. </p>
<p>By supporting Adam's Ale, you are not just helping us create a successful thesis project, but helping to spread the word about the importance of water conservation and advocate global change. </p>
<p>I believe I speak for my cast and crew when I say thank you for your support in this project. </p>
<h3>Want to be a part of the project? Here's how you can help.</h3>
<p>Currently, Adam's Ale is in the pre-production stage. It is projected that we will move into production the second week of January then on to post-production in February. All the donations gained from this campaign will provide us with the resources to do many things. For the Art Department, we need props, set decoration, and wardrobe. We need to cover general costs such as permits, insurance and meals for our cast and crew. Also, we would like to make this project special by bringing in a composer to create a unique score for the film as well as hire and singer/songwriter to write a song for the end credits of the film. Lastly, it is our goal to submit this short film to Film Festivals across the country.</p>
<p>Fortunately, our school has provided us with part of our budget, as well as equipment and one film location, but we are still lacking. Your donations will help us bridge the gap so we can turn this project from a student film, into a meaningful and professional work of art.</p>
<p>In return for your support, we have created many perks as our way of thanking you. Some of them include t-shirts bearing our Tree of Life logo, handcrafted and unique Tree of Life Pendants, movie posters signed by the cast and having your name credited in the movie as a supporter. For a complete and detailed list of perks, please check out the perks page!</p>
</div><div><p>If for some reason we don't reach our goal, whatever proceeds we have made will be split between providing meals to our cast and crew and production design. Whatever is left, if any, will go to post-production.</p></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If you know film production, you know that things ALWAYS go wrong on set. What counteracts that is the crew, organization of the producer and crew leadership, and the effectiveness of the director. Fortunately, I feel that we have a great team. I have worked with most of the crew members and I know that they put everything they have into their work. Not only that, but we have the full support of Los Angeles Film School as well as fantastic instructors there to guide us through until the end. </p>
<p>The only challenges that I foresee is being able to fund the needs of the Art Department. Many things can lower the production value of a film, but one of the biggest is production design. Within this project, there are things that we have to have. Fortunately however, we have some pretty frugal and creative members of our art department team. Even if we don't completely reach our goal and are only able to buy the necessities, I know that we can figure out alternative ways to achieve what we desire for the look of the film. </p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>

<h2><u>WHAT IS THE ROSEWOOD STORY?</u></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>'Rosewood' tells the story of Chris, a determined bass guitar student, who fails to get into a top music academy after he struggles to deal with his dad's recent tragic death. With only one opportunity left to get in, Chris decides to seek help when he stumbles upon Chester, an eccentric music teacher plucking away at the strings of a guitar, as he asks Chester to prepare him for his next audition. However, Chris struggles to learn Chester's idiosyncratic philosophy.</p>

<h2><u>WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP!</u></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Over the last couple of months, working towards the production of the film, the Rosewood crew have already managed to raise just over 50% of the budget, but we still need your help! </p>
<p>In order to complete the film, we need to raise the rest of the budget. So we've come to Indiegogo to showcase our passionate project, and to ask for your help for a contribution towards the film. </p>
<p>Your contributions will be going towards equipment hire (including 16mm film stock), securing locations, art department products &amp; will eventually help with distribution, which will deliver our film to festivals once it is complete. These are all very important aspects of filmmaking that are essential for us to be able to make our film and to make it a success. </p>
<p>Check out the chart below to see exactly where your contributions will be helping towards. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482338001/pzoaqy4iwbjmpdttq2yr.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h2><u>OUR UNIQUE PERKS!</u></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>For your contributions we are offering a wide range of unique perks, including;  a copy of the film upon release, a sneak peek of the film before it's even released, concept artwork, Chester's mixtape and for those looking for something a little bigger - an executive producer credit, a sneak peek into the post-production process &amp; a day on set with the whole cast &amp; crew!</p>

<h2><u>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</u></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>We face various challenges with this project, but none that aren't achievable with the passion and hard work the Rosewood crew have all put forth. One of the most demanding parts of the film will be the soundtrack, as it's a core emotion that will lead our characters within the film. The fact that the Rosewood sound department has decided to create the soundtrack &amp; music score for the film themselves will be a challenge.  Over the past month they have been in the recording studio working hard to create a soundtrack that represents our character's personality, and with more time in the studio exploring and creating this representation, Rosewood will come to life. </p>

'Rosewood' tells the story of Chris, a determined bass guitar student, who fails to get into a top music academy after he struggles to deal with his dad's recent tragic death. With only one opportunity left to get in, Chris decides to seek help when he stumbles upon Chester, an eccentric music teacher plucking away at the strings of a guitar, as he asks Chester to prepare him for his next audition. However, Chris struggles to learn Chester's idiosyncratic philosophy.
 

Chris - determination/tension/focus (Physicality - Inward focused, determined, burdened)

WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP!
 
Over the last couple of months, working towards the production of the film, the Rosewood crew have already managed to raise just over 50% of the budget, but we still need your help! 
In order to complete the film, we need to raise the rest of the budget. So we've come to Indiegogo to showcase our passionate project, and to ask for your help for a contribution towards the film. 
Your contributions will be going towards equipment hire (including 16mm film stock), securing locations, art department products & will eventually help with distribution, which will deliver our film to festivals once it is complete. These are all very important aspects of filmmaking that are essential for us to be able to make our film and to make it a success. 
Check out the chart below to see exactly where your contributions will be helping towards. 

 
OUR UNIQUE PERKS!
 
For your contributions we are offering a wide range of unique perks, including;  a copy of the film upon release, a sneak peek of the film before it's even released, concept artwork, Chester's mixtape and for those looking for something a little bigger - an executive producer credit, a sneak peek into the post-production process & a day on set with the whole cast & crew!

RISKS & CHALLENGES
 
We face various challenges with this project, but none that aren't achievable with the passion and hard work the Rosewood crew have all put forth. One of the most demanding parts of the film will be the soundtrack, as it's a core emotion that will lead our characters within the film. The fact that the Rosewood sound department has decided to create the soundtrack & music score for the film themselves will be a challenge.  Over the past month they have been in the recording studio working hard to create a soundtrack that represents our character's personality, and with more time in the studio exploring and creating this representation, Rosewood will come to life.

We have already secured our main location for the film, where around 50% of the film takes place (as shown below), however, there are still other locations that we are yet to find and secure. We're confident that with a little more time we can find the remaining locations that will make our film visually inspiring.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Help us make a short film about deep regret! Our film features two LGBTQ+ characters, one of whom goes back in time to confess her love to her best friend. My hope with this film is to intrigue with questions about what our past decisions really do to form who we are, as well as provide a glimmer of LGBTQ+ representation. While filming has mostly taken place in Ithaca, New York, we will also be filming the last part in New York City, which will take a lot of resources to get there and film there.</p>
<p>Jessica Saideman is the Writer and Director of Time Gone By. In Time Gone By, Grace, a woman in her 40s at a dead end job and a rebellious teenage daughter, decides to go back in time to confess her feelings to her best friend. However, she finds that changing her past may not be as worth it as she thought it would be.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here's what we need the money for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transportation - We'll be shipping a crew out to NYC for the climax of the film, so we will need money for gas</li>
<li>Krafty - We need food for our wonderful cast and crew!</li>
<li>Parking - Again we'll be in NYC and parking is expensive but we'll need somewhere to put the cars</li>
<li>Props/Production Design - A time machine and the lab that builds it needs to look cool so we need funds to get all sorts of old circuit boards and stuff</li>
<li>Location Fees - We have a great location here in Ithaca to stand in for the interior shots for NYC but we'll need to pay for cleaning fees to obtain the location</li>
</ul>
<p>In return for funding us, for various amounts, you can get: a thank you credit, a poster, a digital copy of the film. </p>

Transportation - We'll be shipping a crew out to NYC for the climax of the film, so we will need money for gas
Krafty - We need food for our wonderful cast and crew!
Parking - Again we'll be in NYC and parking is expensive but we'll need somewhere to put the cars
Props/Production Design - A time machine and the lab that builds it needs to look cool so we need funds to get all sorts of old circuit boards and stuff
Location Fees - We have a great location here in Ithaca to stand in for the interior shots for NYC but we'll need to pay for cleaning fees to obtain the location

In return for funding us, for various amounts, you can get: a thank you credit, a poster, a digital copy of the film.

<h2>A BIG THANK YOU!</h2>
<p><strong>Thank you to everyone who contributed to our campaign in Round One of Unknown Distance The Film. We didn’t reach our goal, but your contributions helped us cover a very important aspect for any film.  Music.   </strong></p>
<p><strong>Music is an essential element of the filmmaking process and is a big factor in determining success or failure. Attaining the rights to a specific song and the music composition throughout the film became a crucial and indispensable element to this story. The process is very difficult and expensive, but it is also integral to the fabric of our film. Your contributions allowed us to make this happen and we are so grateful. It looks amazing and now it sounds amazing! </strong></p>
<p><strong>However, we still need additional funding to get the movie seen and to effect change. Sgt. Douglas Brown, the Combat Vets that participated in the film and all Veterans suffering from PTSD need your help.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our NEW campaign, Unknown Distance The Film - Round Two, is raising funds to cover the costs of taking the film on the road. The goal is to get this documentary seen and distributed properly, so it can open some doors for our returning Veterans. The marketing strategy starts with raising awareness of our film, Unknown Distance, and expanding the profile of Sgt. Douglas Brown. Our marketing and promotion budget includes travel for Doug to attend film festivals we are participating in and media interviews, as well as film festival prerequisites such as DCPs (Digital Cinema Package) and legal fees for required documents for festival submissions and film distribution.   </strong></p>

<p><strong>Gordon Clark, Director/Producer</strong></p>
<p>Very rarely will a combat veteran reveal what is really going on in their head. Marine Sniper, Sgt. Douglas Brown was willing to step up and give a thoughtful and genuine insight into life after the battlefield. It took courage and strength to let a camera follow him around America as he spoke to other brave soldiers that are trying to fit into civilian life while struggling with the after effects of war.</p>
<p>I took a different approach from other documentaries when exploring the treatment of soldiers returning from combat with emotional and physical scars.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499104843/qb7dnfbgnbbtdplejyzz.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>I wanted the viewer to focus on the bigger battle that soldiers with PTSD face in America. The narrative is on American soil, not on a battlefield the civilian world is unfamiliar with.</strong></p>
<p>The opinions of high-ranking military that were aware of this chronic result, frustrated psychologists buried in bureaucracy and politicians that point the finger elsewhere were deliberately avoided. Instead, <strong>the attention is on the raw personal struggles of the Combat Vets in the film.</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499104260/meowgjwxtd34kfnqv2pe.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>I was introduced to an amazing young man named Douglas Brown. He was a Marine Sniper for 10 years and served 5 tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. His account of the personal struggles he has endured since coming home weighed heavy on me and I felt obligated to help Doug and also make an impact on the lives of Combat Vets in America.</p>
<p>Douglas takes us on an eight month journey across America, engaging with fellow servicemen that were once a part of a highly trained team, with a<strong> deadly skill set </strong>that is now rendered useless.​</p>
<p>The story unfolds when Douglas and an Afghan interpreter, who served with him in Afghanistan, reveal the story that bonded them for life. Recalling those horrific memories triggers Doug's existing PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) that continues to erode his personal relationships and has led to his erratic, inappropriate and self-damaging behavior.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498417021/hqy6c5br6edxgi0tk0yg.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>Stories that must be told</strong></h3>
<p>After many broken promises from investors and frustrating attempts to raise funds for a documentary, I reached into my retirement fund and financed the production myself, with no film crew to help. Once we had made that decision, Doug and I journeyed across the United States talking to Veterans that he served with and filming the very real and raw stories they told.</p>
<p>I made a promise to Doug that I would finish this film. I personally have run out of funds and so much more has to be done to get their stories to the world.</p>
<h3><strong>The Film's Impact</strong></h3>
<p>This points us to the fact that more military personnel have taken their own lives after they return home than have fallen in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Over medication and a failing support system only exasperate their efforts to restore qualify of life.</p>
<p>You can make a difference with these soldiers and many others like them. Your generosity means so much. Someone caring means so much to them. Seeing the response in the form of a donation helps them feel like they have completed their mission.</p>
<p>Our <strong>budget</strong> includes film industry standards like insurance, cameras, equipment rentals, travel, legal fees, marketing/promotion, editing, sound/color correction, music, post production, festival costs and more. </p>
<p>We know not everyone can contribute, but this film is for everyone. If you are unable to financially back our documentary, <i>Unknown Distance</i>, we ask that you please share the campaign across all of your social networks.</p>
<p>Please share this  and get it out there and help the Vets that have participated, so that they feel like they have achieved something by sharing their experiences with the civilian world. Having their voices heard may be the only battle they can achieve.</p>

<p>Born in Cheneyville, Louisiana, Douglas Brown scored number one as a rifleman out of 700 Marine recruits, paving the way to Sniper school. In a platoon of 1200, only a few will earn the rare Gold Star on their combat ribbon. Sgt.

<p><strong>“Douglas Brown is by far the best all around recruit in the platoon and stands head and shoulders above his peers with it comes to love of Corps and Country.”  - Commanding Officer, Mike Company</strong></p>

<p>Clark has the ability to go beyond creating a visually arresting film. His  unique insight stems from his desire to seek out and understand human behavior in relation to different environments. Clarkʼs latest works include <i>Staying in the Game</i>, a short film, written, directed and shot by Clark. It highlights the Cape flats 28’s gang and how they have adopted Nike as their uniform, as well as the highly acclaimed documentary, <i>Behind Paradise</i>, that he also produced, shot and promoted.</p>
<p>No stranger to controversy, his current documentary film, <i>Unknown Distance</i>, takes us on a journey across America with highly decorated Marine Sniper, Sgt. Douglas Brown.

<h3>Who?</h3>
<p>My name is Paul Stoichevski.  I am a documentary filmmaker currently directing and producing a documentary for Rogers TV on mental illness.  This NEW campaign is important to me because the full life story of <strong>John Hutchison</strong> needs to be told.  He is a genius inventor, known for The Hutchison Effect, gentle friendly giant and my close personal friend.  I know the many intricate details of his life that previous television producers overlooked, because they were after weird science and not the story of the man himself.  Therefore, I am the best person to tell his story.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2><strong>You</strong></h2>
<p>Contributions will help us film this documentary professionally, which will increase its chances of wider distribution.  If you are going to spend a year of your life on a project, you might as well do it right.  Your contribution will also help my marketing team design a creative distribution strategy that is customized to this film’s content and target audience.  We will begin outreach to audiences and potential organizational partners before or during production.  We will also target core audiences.  The priority is to reach them effectively, and then cross over to a wider public. </p>

<h3>Needed</h3>
<p><strong>$150,000</strong> to make this film the way I envision it.  If I do not reach my funding goal, I will apply to grants and look for private investors, which can take ages.  I prefer to deal with you fine people; at least we will all get something out of it.</p>
<p>So here is where the funding is going.  Note:  my crew has to travel and I always use the same trusted crew for my own documentaries.</p>

<h2><strong>The Impact You Make</strong></h2>
</div><div>
<p>Independent filmmakers, like myself, can spend more time looking for funding than making films.  Being passionate about projects that may never happen is a difficult way to live.  When the funding is achieved for this documentary, and I know it will, it will be a joy to work on a project that I really want to work on.  There is nothing more exciting to me than to collaborate with my film crew on achieving creative uniqueness.  The completion of this film will be a way to honor the life and times of a person who well deserves it...John Hutchison.</p>

My name is Paul Stoichevski.  I am a documentary filmmaker currently directing and producing a documentary for Rogers TV on mental illness.  This NEW campaign is important to me because the full life story of John Hutchison needs to be told.  He is a genius inventor, known for The Hutchison Effect, gentle friendly giant and my close personal friend.  I know the many intricate details of his life that previous television producers overlooked, because they were after weird science and not the story of the man himself.  Therefore, I am the best person to tell his story.

 
You
Contributions will help us film this documentary professionally, which will increase its chances of wider distribution.  If you are going to spend a year of your life on a project, you might as well do it right.  Your contribution will also help my marketing team design a creative distribution strategy that is customized to this film’s content and target audience.  We will begin outreach to audiences and potential organizational partners before or during production.  We will also target core audiences.  The priority is to reach them effectively, and then cross over to a wider public. 


Needed
$150,000 to make this film the way I envision it.  If I do not reach my funding goal, I will apply to grants and look for private investors, which can take ages.  I prefer to deal with you fine people; at least we will all get something out of it.
So here is where the funding is going.  Note:  my crew has to travel and I always use the same trusted crew for my own documentaries.
Producers, Director, Subjects:  $18,850
Supportive Subjects, Production Staff, Set Dressing Labor, Make-up/ Hair Labor, Camera/Electrical/Grip Labor, Productions Sound Labor, Transportation Labor, Transportation, Set Dressing, Wardrobe Supplies, Make-up/Hair Supplies, Camera/Electrical/Grip Equipment, Sound Equipment, Second Unit:  $77,657.50
Editor Labor, Film Post-Production Sound, Music:  $34,600
Publicity & Promo:  $12,892.50
Insurance:  $1,500
Indiegogo Fee:  $4,500
That is as transparent as it gets. 

 
The Impact You Make

Independent filmmakers, like myself, can spend more time looking for funding than making films.  Being passionate about projects that may never happen is a difficult way to live.  When the funding is achieved for this documentary, and I know it will, it will be a joy to work on a project that I really want to work on.  There is nothing more exciting to me than to collaborate with my film crew on achieving creative uniqueness.  The completion of this film will be a way to honor the life and times of a person who well deserves it...John Hutchison.

 
Other Ways You Can Help
Don't be too shy.  You can contribute any amount of money $$$.  We'll take it because we need it.  Get the word out about this documentary in any way you can.  You can use the Indiegogo share tools as well.",5.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>One day in college, I was relaying a funny story about although no one ever assumes I’m gay, I like a ton of stereotypical gay things. Faux-hawks, roller derby, Tegan &amp; Sara, plaid, rainbows, cats, etc... My ex-girlfriend always told me I was a “Giant Lesbian”, so my friend Sara told me to write my next script about “How I Became a Giant Lesbian”. This was the first spark of an idea.</p>
<p>Now that I have produced three short films and live in LA, I returned to this script for a re-write and revival. The story centers around one girl's struggle to find her place within the queer community. She wants to fit in and be visible, but that comes with a cost. She has to figure out if this new persona lives up to who she really is. This story has heart, humor, and contains some real-life experiences I've had to navigate as a femme in the lesbian scene.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486949053/m8sxgvurqbfifpru5cne.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Creating quality queer content is my passion and my purpose in life. I hope to make a difference for our queer community and inspire others to do the same. Visibility and representation really make a difference to gay youth. This film will make you think about what it means to be a lesbian and how to live outside stereotypical boxes.</p>
<h3><strong>Queer Style</strong></h3>
<p>I'm happy to announce that we will have wardrobe provided by Sharpe Suiting, Wild Things Clothing, Basic Butch, and Pattywack Vintage. These are queer owned and operated businesses that cater to everyone, regardless of gender expression or identity.

<h2>Survived!</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The Survived story follows Arthur, an 18 year old boy who is just about to leave home and join the army. He is celebrating his birthday with his closest friends and family and they are set to have an amazing night!</p>
<p>But Suddenly the power goes out and confusion sweeps the city. When Arthur goes to check the power, a loud scream pierces the air. He knows exactly who the scream belongs to.</p>
<p>It's an apocalypse. The stuff of horror films. Does Arthur have anything left to live for? A few months later something very unexpected happens. He is kidnapped and forced to do the worst thing he could imagine. But there's one thing on his mind. Survive.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Arthur, our main character, is 18 years old he is just about to join the army and start the rest of his life when an apocalypse hits! He very well equipped, strong and versatile making him perfectly adapted to the new world. However, he is also a very loving and caring character making it even more painful when he looses those close to him.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>Jenny</strong></u></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502553359/o7bu2rhwovzdhitztgxv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></u></p>
<p>Jenny, our lead actress lives at the survival camp and is a very strong young woman, however she is very mysterious at when we first meet her. However as Arthur gets to know her we find out a bit more about her and the life she had before everything happened. Arthur and Jenny become very close which spreads divisions in the camp and makes everything harder for both characters until the final scene...</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>Troy</strong></u></p>

<p>Troy is Jenny's guardian in the new world, after he found her and her little brother early on and they got attacked, he formed a very close paternal bond to her and will protect Jenny no matter what. Troy is a very brutal character and Arthur sees him as a threat at first but when they face a common threat in this horrid world. Arthur sees the human side to Troy.</p>

<h2>The Survived development:</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Before survived was even born it had to be conceived, this happened alongside 2 other projects, a short film and a feature length film. I must admit I wasn’t too keen on any of them, survived and the feature I thought would never work and the other just lacked sustenance. After development, the short film had been taken off the list, which just left survived and another project. So, we talked to the filmmakers we knew and decided that Survived was the best option! And so, it was conceived!</p>
<p>One of the most convincing things about this incredible story is how relatable it is. Obviously not the zombie apocalypse part but the young people and their stories. The story has a huge focus on the characters and their relationships which have become more and more important to me personally. I think one of the most amazing things about the story is how it shows that we are so engrossed in the internet and everything else that sometimes it can take a huge disaster to bring people together!</p>
<p>Myself and Jackson (Writer) decided to embark on our own and the company’s biggest project yet. Jackson began writing it while I started contacting filmmakers to seek advice and help. Then, with 5 episodes scripted we both took part in a British Film Institute course where we met our core crew!</p>
<p>Luckily everyone who we asked loved the idea and said they would help. So, we had a crew, a script and producer. Now we had to find cast! This was a fairly simple process as we only needed to film 5 scenes. The reason for this is after talking with the crew we decided it would be more beneficial and less risky to film the simple bits and edit a trailer. This made finding a cast easier as they were simple scenes and we did not need to do any auditions (For the final project we will be).</p>
<p>And finally, in late 2016, early 2017 we started filming our 5 scenes, all days went well and you can find one of the trailers on this page now!</p>

<h2>The deal:</h2>
<p>We’re aiming to raise £5,000 from this campaign, our primary goal is to establish an audience and begin production. We have already had a grant of £300 as well as raising almost £300 to begin our project. You can find more details about the finance below.</p>
<p>Our company has a huge advantage in that we comprise of indie filmmakers and many young people. This allows us to budget very efficiently as we are used to working with very small budgets. For example, we will release 5 different trailers over the next few months that have all been made on a budget of £250 for everything, from equipment to props and costumes.</p>
<p>The majority of the £5,000 raised from this initial campaign will go towards marketing as well as the art department and catering. The whole survived project has 4 marketing campaigns each with increasing budget. This fundraiser is being launched alongside marketing 1. Most likely, around £1000-£2000 will go towards the other marketing campaigns with focus on the later stages of development.</p>
<p>During pre-production, our company needs financial resources to allow us to get off with to good start. Here is a short breakdown of our preproduction costs:</p>
<p>·        Admin costs (printing scripts, meeting places, transport) -- £200</p>
<p>·        Actors (Audition venue for 2 days, transport, call out adverts, printing) -- £500</p>
<p>·        Script management (Rewriting, editing, finalizing, research) -- £100</p>
<p>·        Leaflets and outreach -- £100</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Finance:</h3>
<p>The exact production costs for Survived are as follows!</p>
<p>·        Props/costumes and makeup - £2000</p>
<p>·        Locations - £1000</p>
<p>·        Cast/Crew/Exec - £1000</p>
<p>·        Equipment - £2000</p>
<p>The figures above are however, for a minimum budget of £5000 we are hoping to raise further funds with future stunts, crowdfunders, investors and grants our final budget being hopefully around £10,000 to £15,000. These figures will vary and in interest of full disclosure we will keep everyone 100% up to date with figures.</p>

<h2><strong>The big idea:</strong></h2>
<p>Hillpeak Productions Limited, based in Birmingham is a small production company with three founding members, myself William, Jackson and Jagpreet. You can check out our <a href=""http://www.hillpeakproductions.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website.</a> Survived will be our biggest project to date, however with such an experienced crew and an amazing script the goals for the project are easily achievable.</p>
<p>The story follows Arthur (our main character) in this post-apocalyptic world. After a disaster at the start of a new life, he is forced to deal with loosing everyone close to him and has to survive on his own for months. After the same routine day after day, Arthur gets picked up by the only living people he’s seen in weeks. He has to take the seemingly kind offer of a safe place to live and survive… But what are the costs?</p>
<p>The planned release of this series is late in 2018, and we’ve already filmed some test shots and scenes for your enjoyment and you can stay tuned to the campaign to catch our periodic trailers.</p>
<p>“As the director of Survived I wanted to do something different to what I know I would have done a long time ago. I remember growing up and thinking how cool it would be to make an action movie with lots of guns and special effects. While I still think, this might be something to embark on in the future, as an indie filmmaker at my age with my experience I would much rather focus on a short and sweet, uncomplicated story.</p>
<p>When my writer (and best friend) came to me with this idea I immediately thought… no way am I making that movie it’s going to end up under budgeted and it’ll look unprofessional and silly. But being the kind person I am I said, go away, script it and keep it simple.</p>
<p>When he brought it back to me I was astounded…? I knew he was on the verge of an amazing story and provided we could keep it simple and focus on the characters we could make it! Sadly, half way through pre-production it hit me (with a nudge from my producer) that we weren’t going to be able to make that series, at least not yet…</p>
<p>UNTIL NOW! So, I look forward to what this project holds and I really hope we can raise the budget to make an amazing film!</p>

<h2><strong>Our story:</strong></h2>
<p>The story… Or should I say stories! There’s so many working parts and amazing people involved in this project that it would be impossible to just tell one story. So, let’s start off with the individual stories of our writer, director and producer.</p>
<h3><strong>The Director – William Terry-Wright</strong></h3>
<p>            The first thing that really ignited my passion for filmmaking was a short summer course I took part in when I was about 11. I’d been making YouTube videos for a long time by then but this course took my filmmaking up by a notch or two! We got to use very professional equipment and it was more or less the spark that I needed, from there I started improving my video quality, I started using an SD video camera and scripting my shorts. I read lots of books on filmmaking, I read blogs, magazines, articles, youtube videos, anything I could get my hands on to learn more about filmmaking.</p>
<p>My best friend at the time and now Hillpeak colleague, Jackson was also making videos for Youtube so we started to partner up, scripting and storyboarding for each other. Sadly, this did not last and school commitments took over our lives. Until 2015 when we both sat down and decided we would start making videos, but this time they would be well scripted and more professional.</p>
<p>Admittedly our early tries were not very successful but we soon got the hang of it and started making more and more videos and started doing film reviews. The shorts we were making were not masterpieces by any means however they each had their strengths. Some were very cinematic, some had lots of action, some were stupid comedy sketches (Yes I still laugh at them to this day) and others were just silly videos we made because we were bored.</p>
<p>It was soon after this that Hillpeak Productions was born. We knew we had to start upping our budgets from double figures and we wanted them to look even more professional. It gave us a platform to pitch with and somewhere to put our best videos.</p>
<p>Then, in early 2016, Survived was born.</p>
<p>We decided we would both embark on our biggest project to date and we began bouncing ideas back and forth. After some debating we pitched two or three to some local filmmakers. Survived happened to be the most achievable so we began storyboarding and scripting. See the survived story for more.</p>
<h3><strong>The Writer – Jackson Clifford.</strong></h3>
<p>Me and William decided we would embark on our biggest project yet and I started to write the series. Initially it was going to be a short film, however after some consideration we decided to turn it into a 5 part series. This allowed us to pack a bit more in but also leave cliff hangers and let the audience become more invested.</p>
<p>After a few edits we had a great script and we pitched it to a group of young people who were into filmmaking and the rest is history! If we raise the goal then I would starrt to rewrite a bit more to extend and shorten parts to get it as good as possible and do some character building!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Producer – Jagpreet Jhamat</h3>
<p>I attended the BFI academy in Birmingham and that's where I met Jackson and Will who told me about Survived. After the academy I was asked to produce it as that is what I ultimately want to get involved in!</p>
<p>It's been very interesting taking part in Survived so far, I've met some amazing actors and actresses and it has really tought me a lot about producing and filmmaking in general!</p>
<p>I hope that we raise a full budget because I really want to see some of these young cast and crew flourish and I also think it is a great story to tell and I would love to be on the red carpet as well! Haha!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Hillpeak Story</h3>
<p>Hillpeak Productions Limited is an incorporated company (<a href=""http://www.hillpeakproductions.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.hillpeakproductions.co.uk</a>) conceived by William Terry-Wright and directed by Jackson and Jagpreet. When the name Hillpeak Productions was first born, we had no idea it would grow so big.</p>
<p>It started off as a small youtube channel and a logo that we’d put on our videos. That’s what it was after months of debating and planning. That is until mid-2016 when Jackson and William started making some more professional films. They then met Jag and saw her excellent potential and then, early 2017 Hillpeak Productions was turned into Hillpeak Productions Limited, registered and ready to trade. After just 4 months, the company had gone from just a youtube channel to having a huge, professional website; 5 portfolio videos; 3 directors; 6 employees and a limited company. So naturally our next step is to embark on what we hope will make our company more well known in the industry.</p>
<p>Survived is mostly funded and commissioned by Hillpeak Productions Limited and its partner Riverside films and will hopefully be the start of an amazing business!</p>

""He is kidnapped and forced to do
the worst thing he could imagine""
 
Survived!
 
The Survived story follows Arthur, an 18 year old boy who is just about to leave home and join the army. He is celebrating his birthday with his closest friends and family and they are set to have an amazing night!
But Suddenly the power goes out and confusion sweeps the city. When Arthur goes to check the power, a loud scream pierces the air. He knows exactly who the scream belongs to.
It's an apocalypse. The stuff of horror films. Does Arthur have anything left to live for? A few months later something very unexpected happens. He is kidnapped and forced to do the worst thing he could imagine. But there's one thing on his mind. Survive.
 
The characters!
 
Arthur

Arthur, our main character, is 18 years old he is just about to join the army and start the rest of his life when an apocalypse hits! He very well equipped, strong and versatile making him perfectly adapted to the new world. However, he is also a very loving and caring character making it even more painful when he looses those close to him.
 
Jenny

Jenny, our lead actress lives at the survival camp and is a very strong young woman, however she is very mysterious at when we first meet her. However as Arthur gets to know her we find out a bit more about her and the life she had before everything happened. Arthur and Jenny become very close which spreads divisions in the camp and makes everything harder for both characters until the final scene...
 
Troy

Troy is Jenny's guardian in the new world, after he found her and her little brother early on and they got attacked, he formed a very close paternal bond to her and will protect Jenny no matter what. Troy is a very brutal character and Arthur sees him as a threat at first but when they face a common threat in this horrid world. Arthur sees the human side to Troy.

The Survived development:
 
Before survived was even born it had to be conceived, this happened alongside 2 other projects, a short film and a feature length film. I must admit I wasn’t too keen on any of them, survived and the feature I thought would never work and the other just lacked sustenance. After development, the short film had been taken off the list, which just left survived and another project. So, we talked to the filmmakers we knew and decided that Survived was the best option! And so, it was conceived!
One of the most convincing things about this incredible story is how relatable it is. Obviously not the zombie apocalypse part but the young people and their stories. The story has a huge focus on the characters and their relationships which have become more and more important to me personally. I think one of the most amazing things about the story is how it shows that we are so engrossed in the internet and everything else that sometimes it can take a huge disaster to bring people together!
Myself and Jackson (Writer) decided to embark on our own and the company’s biggest project yet. Jackson began writing it while I started contacting filmmakers to seek advice and help. Then, with 5 episodes scripted we both took part in a British Film Institute course where we met our core crew!
Luckily everyone who we asked loved the idea and said they would help. So, we had a crew, a script and producer. Now we had to find cast! This was a fairly simple process as we only needed to film 5 scenes. The reason for this is after talking with the crew we decided it would be more beneficial and less risky to film the simple bits and edit a trailer. This made finding a cast easier as they were simple scenes and we did not need to do any auditions (For the final project we will be).
And finally, in late 2016, early 2017 we started filming our 5 scenes, all days went well and you can find one of the trailers on this page now!

<h3>Message From The Director</h3>
<p>We all have that one dream we hold close to us since we were kids. When we grow and try to pursue it, maybe a lot of people will say you can’t do it, you're no good, or you're not even worthy. Trying won't be enough. If you really want it, you must be hungry. You have to fight for it. But above all, you must believe. Just like the main character YuBai, a person must be willing to risk anything in the pursuit of their dreams.</p>

<p>The production of the short film WINGS is founded on a collaborative group of student filmmakers culminating their last year at California State University, Northridge. This project will bring closure as these innovative and talented young filmmakers will apply all their skills in creating a highly professional short film.   </p>
<h3>Brief Summary</h3>
<p>This story is about a young man from Shanghai named YuBai who travels to the United States in the hopes of becoming a professional college basketball player. As he begins his journey, he encounters difficult challenges such as language barrier, culture shock, and resistance. This experience will test YuBai's limits and see how far he is willing to go to make this sacrifice count. </p>

<h3>Against All Odds - Feature Length Documentary</h3>
<p><i>""Against All Odds is a ground-breaking feature-length documentary from EMMY and double Bafta award-winning director Mags Gavan, Julie Reason and Tami Canal, the founder of March Against Monsanto""</i></p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My name is Julie Reason, the creator and one of the producers behind Against All Odds, and I would love for you to get involved with our feature-length documentary and be part of something special that needs to be heard.</p>
<p>There are people all around the world who, after being given a terminal diagnosis for cancer, have become cancer free or are living prosperous lives with cancer through changes in their lifestyle, adopting anti-cancer protocols and self-prescribing things such as cannabis oil. </p>
<p>With cancer rates sky rocketing over the years and one in two people currently being affected by cancer, I feel that as a society we can no longer assume it will happen to somebody else.</p>
<p>When I was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer in 2014 my life was turned upside down, and having listened to the medical establishment I was handed a death sentence. Over the last three years I have used a combination of conventional medical treatments and anti-cancer protocols. If I knew then what I know now I certainly would have approached things differently in life.</p>
<p>Our film, Against All Odds, with a bit of injected humour and the help of leading experts from around the world will provide you with an insight why cancer is on the rise and give you an inspiring look into the lives of people who are beating cancer after they have been labelled as terminal. We aim to tell you a story that will open your eyes to some dirty truths, as well as send out a message of hope, especially to those affected by cancer.</p>
<p>I have a duty as a mother to fight for our children's future to ensure they are healthy long after we have gone, like we all should.</p>

It’s a coming of age story about the experiences of being an LGBT youth, the vulnerable age of being a teenager and trying to understand your desires and identity amongst the intoxication of friendships and the excitement of belonging.</p><p>The film follows the main protagonist, Mina, as she navigates her way through new excitements and awakenings. It’s a coming of age story with a different twist – exploring the psychological, claustrophobic and a misguided and darker view of sexual desire and disappointments.</p><p>For us the story is a narrative and point of view of female experiences that isn’t necessarily shown enough on screen – the pressures, the crisis of identity, the confusion of experiences and how this effects and hurts us are all elements that Cait Lyn is exploring through in this short film – her thesis graduation project for her MA degree at The London Film School.</p><p>It’s an important story to be told and an important narrative that we want accessible for audiences. It’s a story that is relatable to everyone and their experiences in a way – trying to understand themselves, the world around them, and the decisions they make that help or hinder the relationship you have with yourself. Loneliness, longing and an idea we have of love.</p><p>For the director, the story is a personal one, inspired by her own experiences of growing up and coming to terms with her own sexuality.</p><p><strong>WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT</strong></p><p>Some Girls is currently in Post Production and we’re looking for your support to help us complete the last part of the process! Filmmaking is expensive, but we want to deliver to you, the audience and our collaborators the best quality possible for the end product of the film.</p><p>Your support would help us complete our editing process, a professional colour grade, sound mix, working with a composer and music rights for the final film. As well as this we are hoping to send the film to international and recognised festivals so it can be seen by even more audiences!</p><p>Here’s where your support will go:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496768327/g7sudgj4c6jtl5spmckg.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><table border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0""><tbody><tr>

It’s a coming of age story about the experiences of being an LGBT youth, the vulnerable age of being a teenager and trying to understand your desires and identity amongst the intoxication of friendships and the excitement of belonging.The film follows the main protagonist, Mina, as she navigates her way through new excitements and awakenings. It’s a coming of age story with a different twist – exploring the psychological, claustrophobic and a misguided and darker view of sexual desire and disappointments.For us the story is a narrative and point of view of female experiences that isn’t necessarily shown enough on screen – the pressures, the crisis of identity, the confusion of experiences and how this effects and hurts us are all elements that Cait Lyn is exploring through in this short film – her thesis graduation project for her MA degree at The London Film School.It’s an important story to be told and an important narrative that we want accessible for audiences. It’s a story that is relatable to everyone and their experiences in a way – trying to understand themselves, the world around them, and the decisions they make that help or hinder the relationship you have with yourself. Loneliness, longing and an idea we have of love.For the director, the story is a personal one, inspired by her own experiences of growing up and coming to terms with her own sexuality.WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORTSome Girls is currently in Post Production and we’re looking for your support to help us complete the last part of the process!

<i>Strange Fruit - </i>a short film by Anthony Rojas</h3>
<p><strong>When a Latino college student finds himself being the only person of color at a bonfire, he must fight for his life miles away from home.</strong></p>
<p>Set in 2016, <strong><i>Strange Fruit</i></strong> is a psychological thriller that follows Samuel Rodriguez, a Latino college student, who questions his place on campus. After being ostracized for speaking his already broken-spanish, he is invited by his close white friend, Jacob “Jake” Lyes, who invites “Sam” to a bonfire. Upon arriving, Samuel quickly realizes that this is not a bonfire but some kind attack because of his ethnicity. <i><strong>Samuel fights for his life in an oddly-intimate, disturbing, and degrading series of events.</strong></i></p>

<p>His debut into the festival-circuit, Negatives, won <strong>""Excellence In Filmmaking"" in the Student Film Category at the Inwood Film Festival</strong>, March 2019. </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i>Why does this film need to be made?</i></h3>
<p>I need to make this film because there is not only an <strong>absence of Latinx leads in horror/thriller film narratives</strong>— but who’s unique experiences have yet to be reflected on screen. These experiences include:</p>
<p>1. The pre-Trump and post-Trump alienation experienced by Latinx students on college campuses; many of which are first and second generation immigrants and DACA recipients. </p>
<p>2. Any POC experience when being introduced into a new environment. Having to choose whether to deny the dominant culture and retreat into their own, assimilate into the dominant culture, or create a multi-faceted identity. </p>
<p>3. Millennials &amp; prior generations witnessing injustices of social, political and economic institutions from 2016 onward.</p>
<p>This film amplifies these struggles; both realistically <strong>conveying the daily-intricacies of being a new kid on campus</strong> and the extreme of <strong>being persecuted for being different</strong>. At a glance, a seemingly heightened situation that is grounded in real-life, political events at a singular moment in history: the election of Donald Trump. This film is allegorical for the rollercoaster of emotions many experienced up until the night of the election: <i>being blissfully optimistic, becoming fearful of your surroundings, and being abused to the point of no return.</i></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i>Why am I the person to make this film?</i></h3>
<p>I am the person to make this film because-- not only have I experienced the struggle of attempting to fit in to one group and being unable to do so-- but have also experienced the <i><strong>fear</strong></i> of being a person of color in an America where gun violence, race crimes and social injustices happen every single day.</p>
<p>This film is a psychological reflection of the emotional journey we <i>have</i> and <i>are</i> currently going through in today’s political and social climate.</p>
<p>*<strong><i>FROM</i> </strong>the unique perspective of a young Latino filmmaker presenting these ideas in a visually delicate yet dichotomously disturbing way. It is a reflection of what many people of color, specifically Latinx, have been feeling from 2016 onward.</p>
<p><i>Strange Fruit</i> possesses extreme cultural relevance and historical association to not only 2016 as a turning-point in history, but as an encapsulation of the Latinx experience living in the United States. <i><strong>Whether that be a college student struggling to fit in, a person who fears stepping out of their home, or a culture being violently stripped of its richness, Strange Fruit encapsulates it all.</strong></i> </p>

<p>While the representation of women in film is improving as a whole, we find that a demographic that is overlooked is that of prepubescent girls. Childhood is one of the most impactful and psychologically complicated times in a person's life, and while films like ""We Need To Talk About Kevin"" and ""Lord of The Flies"" effectively explore the compelling topic of the inherent darkness in children, they do this exclusively through male protagonists. In contrast, young girls in film are often one-dimensional and almost always representative of an epitomal naivité or innocence to be corrupted. </p>
<p>This contrast in representation implies that the struggle with morality is solely one that men go through, something that is both untrue and problematic for young women that cannot adhere to the monochrome portrayal of the female psyche. </p>
<p>Our protagonist, Madeline George, is a young girl that has been hurt as an innocent and is now struggling with the desire to hurt anther innocent herself. We believe that creating this film is important as it is character study of a dynamic female lead that finds the strength to stop the cycle of abuse she is close to furthering.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Matthew Olienechak. and I am a senior in Digital Media Production.  I am looking for some monetary help with my senior project, which will be a culmination of my time spent at the university. I'm looking to make a visually interesting art film, to show that film can be a true art form, and unfortunately, that requires some sizable funding.</p>
<p>That's why I'm reaching out, in the hopes that I can reach my goal through crowdfunding.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>A good film requires props, costumes, and set dressing. That is where most of the funding will go towards, with your excellent art department taking your donations and making the best possible use of them. The rest will go towards feeding the crew and covering admission fees to film festivals.</p>
<p>That's not to say that we'll be the only ones to benefit from your generosity! We have many ""thank you"" rewards planned, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name in the credits and on IMDb.</li>
<li>Props and signed scripts.</li>
<li>Digital downloads of the finished film. </li>
<li>And much more!</li>

Hi, my name is Matthew Olienechak. and I am a senior in Digital Media Production.  I am looking for some monetary help with my senior project, which will be a culmination of my time spent at the university. I'm looking to make a visually interesting art film, to show that film can be a true art form, and unfortunately, that requires some sizable funding.
That's why I'm reaching out, in the hopes that I can reach my goal through crowdfunding.

What We Need & What You Get
A good film requires props, costumes, and set dressing. That is where most of the funding will go towards, with your excellent art department taking your donations and making the best possible use of them. The rest will go towards feeding the crew and covering admission fees to film festivals.
That's not to say that we'll be the only ones to benefit from your generosity! We have many ""thank you"" rewards planned, such as:

Your name in the credits and on IMDb.
Props and signed scripts.
Digital downloads of the finished film. 
And much more!

It's DONE!</p><p><strong><i>I am NOT ASKING for more money to finish SKY FIGHTER!!!</i></strong></p><p>The film is IN THE CAN! FINISHED! COMPLETED!</p><p>Naturally, it cost far more than we originally planned or raised to finish the film. But I couldn't bear to come back to donors with an incomplete film. </p><p>So I finished it with my MasterCard. INSANE!</p><p>And yeah, the credit card interest is kicking my ass so I would love it if people found the finished film so entertaining they gave more money. It's up to you!</p><p>This campaign is the solution to two problems:</p><p>1) There is one perk left from the <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sky-fighter-sci-fi-short-film-by-lukas-kendall/x/18004894#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2018 Indiegogo</a> that I have yet to fulfill: the Ron Jones soundtrack CD. Unfortunately this is impossible to fill...because Ron didn't score the film! So the CD will never exist. (See below for more information.)</p><p>So I owe the 2018 donors something that won't exist...and the only thing I can think of to give them is something with MORE VALUE than originally promised: not only the finished score (by a terrific young composer I was fortunate to meet, <a href=""http://bobby-villarreal.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bobby Villarreal</a>) but a Blu-ray of the film itself, packaged as double-disc set—as the 251st FILM SCORE MONTHLY soundtrack release.</p><p>2) I can't wait to show off the film—but I can't distribute it on the Internet because it will void our eligibility to all-important film festivals. However, I think—I hope—I can give out a private link solely to donors, without running afoul of festival rules.</p><h3>How to Use This Campaign</h3><p>If you contributed to the 2018 campaign and are waiting for a soundtrack CD...</p><p>You don't have to do anything! The Blu-ray/soundtrack CD combo will be sent to you automatically later this year (after the film finishes its festival run)!</p><p>Also, I will email you the private viewing link—as I will be sending that to ALL our 2018 donors so they can view the film.</p><p>However, if you want to help MORE:</p><p>1) You can UPGRADE to the autographed copy of the Blu-Ray/soundtrack CD for $15.</p><p>2) OR, you can buy the new, 2019 discount code package (good at <a href=""http://www.screenarchives.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Screen Archives</a> for FSM CDs, <a href=""https://buysoundtrax.myshopify.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Buy Soundtrax</a> and <a href=""https://lalalandrecords.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">La-La Land Records</a>) for $49.</p><p>3) OR, you can buy the new, 2019 discount code package (good at <a href=""http://www.screenarchives.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Screen Archives</a> for FSM CDs, <a href=""https://buysoundtrax.myshopify.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Buy Soundtrax</a> and <a href=""https://lalalandrecords.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">La-La Land Records</a>) AND get the autograph UPGRADE for $59.</p><p>If you are a NEW DONOR:</p><p>1) Just ignore the choices at the $15 and $59 levels—those involve upgrading a perk from last year that doesn't apply to you.</p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556080507/jjtdjjorqgawg1pyaue2.jpg"" src=""""/></h3><h3>Who Did You Make the Short With?</h3><p>Lots of people and they were soooo amazing! <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8489046/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">See the credits at IMDB</a>.</p><p>Our cast are <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1855008/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tom Maden</a> (<i>Scream: TV Series</i>), <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6373769/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jess Gabor</a> (<i>Shameless</i>), <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005292/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Erik Palladino</a> (<i>ER</i>), <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6236073/?ref_=tt_cl_t4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Declan Churchill Carter</a> (as the younger version of Tom's character) and <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0258268/?ref_=tt_cl_t5"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Richard Epcar</a> (a voice from <i>Robotech</i> and numerous other anime and video game projects).  </p><p>Crew include Producers <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5364436/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Levi Smock</a>, <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2617018/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cr4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Daniel Marks</a>, <a href=""http://christinesheaks.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Christine Sheaks</a>, Executive Producer <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6614168/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cr2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Daniel Brandt</a> and Associate Producer Craig Rogers (from our <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sky-fighter-sci-fi-short-film-by-lukas-kendall/x/18004894#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">first Indiegogo</a>—thanks Craig!). </p><p>The spectacular cinematography is by <a href=""https://www.marksfilms.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Daniel Marks</a>, the production design by <a href=""https://www.benjaminralston.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Benjamin Ralston</a>, the VFX by <a href=""http://www.thelightworks.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tobias Richter and The Light Works</a>, costume design by <a href=""https://www.meganlian.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Megan Lian</a>, editing by <a href=""http://theburnettwork.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Robert Meyer Burnett</a> and music by <a href=""http://bobby-villarreal.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bobby Villarreal</a>.

Also, he lives north of Seattle (he has a beautiful facility called <a href=""https://www.skymusestudios.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SkyMuse Studios</a>) while I am in Los Angeles, and I can't easily travel with small kids at home. So logistically we had a hard time communicating. </p><p>I'm truly sorry for the folks expecting a new Ron Jones score—I was too. These things happen!</p><p>I am so happy with Bobby Villarreal's score and look forward to saying more about him and his music once everybody has a chance to watch the film!</p><h3>Are You Making a Feature Version?</h3><p>I sure hope so! I have written a feature script of SKY FIGHTER (not a continuation of the short, but a longer story based on the same characters and premise) and my producing partners and I are actively trying to get it made. </p><p>Truly, thank you to all our Indiegogo supporters for giving me the opportunity to direct the short and prove myself as a filmmaker!</p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556136011/exj7x2h4w45ne25n0f9t.png"" src=""""/></h3><h3>FSM CDs—The Discounts</h3><p><a href=""https://www.filmscoremonthly.com/daily/index.cfm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Film Score Monthly</a> was a magazine and record label that I created while in high school (1990) and still exists today as a <a href=""https://www.filmscoremonthly.com/daily/index.cfm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a> and <a href=""https://www.filmscoremonthly.com/fsmonline/main.cfm?issueID=171"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">subscription pay site</a>.

It's DONE!I am NOT ASKING for more money to finish SKY FIGHTER!!!The film is IN THE CAN! FINISHED! COMPLETED!Naturally, it cost far more than we originally planned or raised to finish the film. But I couldn't bear to come back to donors with an incomplete film. So I finished it with my MasterCard. INSANE!And yeah, the credit card interest is kicking my ass so I would love it if people found the finished film so entertaining they gave more money. It's up to you!This campaign is the solution to two problems:1) There is one perk left from the 2018 Indiegogo that I have yet to fulfill: the Ron Jones soundtrack CD. Unfortunately this is impossible to fill...because Ron didn't score the film! So the CD will never exist. (See below for more information.)So I owe the 2018 donors something that won't exist...and the only thing I can think of to give them is something with MORE VALUE than originally promised: not only the finished score (by a terrific young composer I was fortunate to meet, Bobby Villarreal) but a Blu-ray of the film itself, packaged as double-disc set—as the 251st FILM SCORE MONTHLY soundtrack release.2) I can't wait to show off the film—but I can't distribute it on the Internet because it will void our eligibility to all-important film festivals. However, I think—I hope—I can give out a private link solely to donors, without running afoul of festival rules.How to Use This CampaignIf you contributed to the 2018 campaign and are waiting for a soundtrack CD...You don't have to do anything! The Blu-ray/soundtrack CD combo will be sent to you automatically later this year (after the film finishes its festival run)!Also, I will email you the private viewing link—as I will be sending that to ALL our 2018 donors so they can view the film.However, if you want to help MORE:1) You can UPGRADE to the autographed copy of the Blu-Ray/soundtrack CD for $15.2) OR, you can buy the new, 2019 discount code package (good at Screen Archives for FSM CDs, Buy Soundtrax and La-La Land Records) for $49.3) OR, you can buy the new, 2019 discount code package (good at Screen Archives for FSM CDs, Buy Soundtrax and La-La Land Records) AND get the autograph UPGRADE for $59.If you are a NEW DONOR:1) Just ignore the choices at the $15 and $59 levels—those involve upgrading a perk from last year that doesn't apply to you.Who Did You Make the Short With?Lots of people and they were soooo amazing! See the credits at IMDB.Our cast are Tom Maden (Scream: TV Series), Jess Gabor (Shameless), Erik Palladino (ER), Declan Churchill Carter (as the younger version of Tom's character) and Richard Epcar (a voice from Robotech and numerous other anime and video game projects).  Crew include Producers Levi Smock, Daniel Marks, Christine Sheaks, Executive Producer Daniel Brandt and Associate Producer Craig Rogers (from our first Indiegogo—thanks Craig!). The spectacular cinematography is by Daniel Marks, the production design by Benjamin Ralston, the VFX by Tobias Richter and The Light Works, costume design by Megan Lian, editing by Robert Meyer Burnett and music by Bobby Villarreal. Many thanks to FSM art director Joe Sikoryak for the titles! And, of course, to the many more people who comprised the crew and helped the production in so many ways—including our 2018 Indiegogo supporters!Our 2018 Indiegogo contributors, with perk to get credit on the film itself:Why No Ron Jones Score?Ron and I just couldn't get on the same page creatively because I wanted a retro synth score, and while he actually did many of the 1980s synth scores that influenced what I wanted, that wasn't where he is at as an artist right now. Also, he lives north of Seattle (he has a beautiful facility called SkyMuse Studios) while I am in Los Angeles, and I can't easily travel with small kids at home. So logistically we had a hard time communicating. I'm truly sorry for the folks expecting a new Ron Jones score—I was too. These things happen!I am so happy with Bobby Villarreal's score and look forward to saying more about him and his music once everybody has a chance to watch the film!Are You Making a Feature Version?I sure hope so! I have written a feature script of SKY FIGHTER (not a continuation of the short, but a longer story based on the same characters and premise) and my producing partners and I are actively trying to get it made. Truly, thank you to all our Indiegogo supporters for giving me the opportunity to direct the short and prove myself as a filmmaker!FSM CDs—The DiscountsFilm Score Monthly was a magazine and record label that I created while in high school (1990) and still exists today as a website and subscription pay site. Between 1996 and 2012 we released 250 albums of classic film and television scores. Today, roughly half the catalog is sold out, with the other half largely out of print and the remaining inventory sold off by our distributor, Screen Archives Entertainment. Whether you are a longtime collector looking to fill holes in your collection, or a neophyte interested in getting a few key collectibles (there are some great sci-fi titles in here, like Logan's Run, Outland and The Thing From Another World), this is a great opportunity to pick up titles at huge discounts! Donate to this Indiegogo campaign and you'll get a discount code for SAE that lets you get up to 75% off most of the remaining catalog.Here's a jingle by Lalo Schifrin (from THX 1138) to get you in the shopping mood!Following are the titles being discounted:75% OFF these titles ($5 each for single-disc albums):36 Hours (Dimitri Tiomkin)Above and Beyond (Hugo Friedhofer)—one of my favorites!All Fall Down/The Outrage (Alex North)The Americanization of Emily/The Sandpiper/Drums of Africa (Johnny Mandel) 3CD setThe Belle of New York (musical)Bell, Book and Candle/1001 Arabian Knights (George Duning)Between Heaven and Hell/Soldier of Fortune (Hugo Friedhofer)The Big Bus (David Shire)—great 1970s disaster comedy score!Big Wednesday (Basil Poledouris)—stirring symphonic score to John Milius surfing movieBroken Lance (Leigh Harline)Cain’s Hundred (Jerry Goldsmith) early TV crime seriesThe Cobweb/Edge of the City (Leonard Rosenman)The Comedians/Hotel Paradiso (Laurence Rosenthal) 2CD setCrossed Swords (Maurice Jarre) great adventure score!David Raksin at M-G-M (5CD set of rare scores)Deadfall (John Barry)Dead Ringer (Andre Previn)—great macabre suspense score!The Devil at 4 O’Clock/The Victors (George Duning/Sol Kaplan)Diamond Head/Gone With the Wave (John Williams/Lalo Schifrin)Diane (Miklós Rózsa) 2CD setDragon Seed (Herbert Stothart)Eye of the Devil (Gary McFarland)—great melodic horror score!The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T (classic Dr. Seuss musical, Frederick Hollander) 3CD setThe Great Santini (Elmer Bernstein)Green Fire/Bhowani Junction (Miklós Rózsa)The Gypsy Moths (Elmer Bernstein)—beautiful!Home From the Hill (Bronislau Kaper)The Homecoming: A Christmas Story/Rascals and Robbers (Jerry Goldsmith/James Horner)—rare TV scoresHunters Are for Killing (Jerry Fielding) rare TV movie scoreThe Ice Pirates (Bruce Broughton)—1980s sci-fi/action comedy scoreI Spy, Vol. 2—The LPs (Earle Hagen)John Goldfarb, Please Come Home!

<p><strong>What is Monarch About?</strong></p>
<p><strong>STORY: </strong>The film is set in the 90s in a small, sleepy town. It centers around Agnes, a young woman in her 20s who waits on tables at the local diner. When she is not caring for her prescription addicted mother, she is constantly studying serial killer cases and is enthralled by them. After a small string of murders that happen in her community, she seeks out after the media sensationalized ""Monarch Murderer"". After stumbling upon “Monarch” in the middle of a murdering his latest victim in the woods, Agnes is caught and becomes the next victim in line. Locked in his basement, she must use all of her skills to break free and ultimately decide whether to comply with his demands or resist.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND: </strong>We are introduced to Agnes as an intelligent individual and thinks highly of her abilities. Besides having to deal with her abusive prescription addicted mother, Agnes spends her time investigating the recent string of murders. Her house is messy, reeks of cigarettes, and is littered with the memories of  abandonment from her family. She is the opposite of her living situation. The black sheep in her family, if not, her town. From her very neat room, you can tell she is calculated, observant, and each item is placed with precision and purpose. Her obsession with tracking down the serial killer has consumed her entirely.</p>
<p>Agnes is a film that feels like a thriller, bleeds like horror and deals with the complexities of a teenage girl becoming a woman like an indie film. It is set in the 90s and is inspired by the raw cult classic films of that era. Agnes represents the powerful female characters that people still adore today. Characters such as Clarice Starling in Silence of The Lambs, Karen Hill in Goodfellas and Mathilda in The Professional. Women who were presented with difficult choices and had to own their power and become stronger than their circumstances.</p>
<p>Agnes is the hero of her own story. She creates it, writes it and ends it in her thrilling fashion. The film is a love letter to women who feel different, women who feel human and messy and don’t always make the right choices.</p>
<p><strong>VISUAL TONE AND STYLE:</strong> The visual tone and style will be dark and horror based. Similar to the style of “It Follows”, that sleepy small town stillness that leaves a pit in your stomach. Visually it will beautiful and cinematic, creatively using color to express the characters moods and where the story is headed. It will feel fast paced in the thrill as we feel Agnes’ anxiety.  </p>
<p>Since Agnes is set in the 90s, we will stay true to the early 90s era, using technology from that time, CD players and old TV sets.</p>
<p>The soundtrack should feel like an 80s horror film with a mix of classic rock from the 70s. The score should be cinematic and original.</p> <p><strong>CHARACTERS: </strong></p>
<p><strong>AGNES (20s): </strong>An outcasted young woman with a curious, intellectual mind. She’s a lovable tomboy and misfit who gets caught up when her obsessions with true crime manifests in the real world. A young Winona Ryder or Natalie Portman. A cunning yet antisocial young woman who lives in her own world.</p>
<p>During the start of the film we feel her feel, insecurities and helplessness but as the film flips and she owns her power we see the creation of a completely new character. By the end of the film we are mesmerized by her, her transformation is extraordinary and she becomes a cult hero.</p>
<p><strong>THE MONARCH MURDERER (MID 40s): </strong>Our killer is physically intimidating, his size and strength is enough to allow Agnes to feel weak. A highly skilled huntsman, active outdoorsman, and overall a man’s man. He can also make a killer cocktail.</p>
<p>Mentally he’s going through a midlife crisis. He doesn’t feel like himself, he’s emotional and touchy, he smokes too many cigarettes, and feels the need to carry his legacy on yet he doesn’t have any children. At times he’s lovable and weirdly charming, feeling and grooving to old records he plays. His human nature makes him all the more terrifying. We ask ourselves how can we love a man that’s so horrible. There seems to be no method to his madness and he often spirals off like the joker or Jack Nicholson in The Shining. We fear his unpredictability and the fact that he’s a man with a terribly sick and twisted mind.</p>
<p><br/><br/><strong>STRATEGY:</strong> ‘Monarch’ will be first shot as a 10-15 minute low budget short film and submitted to all major film festivals. The short will be used to promote the possibility of a feature film or television series furthering the character development and story.</p>
<h3>Why This Film Is Important</h3>
<p>As a filmmaker my ultimate goal is to make audiences think differently, it's in my nature to shake things up. With ""Monarch"" we see a classic tale of a deranged serial killer and his victim but the twists and turns bring us back to the complexity of human nature.  </p>
<p>Monarch is important because we believe the world is ready for new stories about women. With this film we are able to explore and dig deeper into the psychology of how women have been written onscreen. With ""Monarch"" we bring you a film that's both beautiful to look at as well as to think about and discuss. </p>
<p>In helping us make this film you are giving  female filmmakers a platform to rewrite how women are viewed on screen. But more importantly you are giving women a chance to tell a story from our perspective and this changes everything. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>""As a filmmaker, I truly believe in shaking it up and I feel Monarch does just that. My rebellious nature wants to shock audiences, but my sweet side wants you to learn something or leave changed for the better. I'm in love with this story, the way it flowed out of me was so natural. I knew it was a film that needed to be seen. The characters are so rich, my producer Jessica and I have already been discussing them as if they we're people we both knew. It's rare to get a crew together that's as passionate as ours and I know the final product will be magical. I know this story will resonate with people, it will be a classic and I'm already writing a pilot script in case Netflix options a series out of this. I believe in MONARCH!""</p>

</div></div>","What is Monarch About?
STORY: The film is set in the 90s in a small, sleepy town. It centers around Agnes, a young woman in her 20s who waits on tables at the local diner. When she is not caring for her prescription addicted mother, she is constantly studying serial killer cases and is enthralled by them. After a small string of murders that happen in her community, she seeks out after the media sensationalized ""Monarch Murderer"". After stumbling upon “Monarch” in the middle of a murdering his latest victim in the woods, Agnes is caught and becomes the next victim in line. Locked in his basement, she must use all of her skills to break free and ultimately decide whether to comply with his demands or resist.
BACKGROUND: We are introduced to Agnes as an intelligent individual and thinks highly of her abilities. Besides having to deal with her abusive prescription addicted mother, Agnes spends her time investigating the recent string of murders. Her house is messy, reeks of cigarettes, and is littered with the memories of  abandonment from her family. She is the opposite of her living situation. The black sheep in her family, if not, her town. From her very neat room, you can tell she is calculated, observant, and each item is placed with precision and purpose. Her obsession with tracking down the serial killer has consumed her entirely.
Agnes is a film that feels like a thriller, bleeds like horror and deals with the complexities of a teenage girl becoming a woman like an indie film. It is set in the 90s and is inspired by the raw cult classic films of that era. Agnes represents the powerful female characters that people still adore today. Characters such as Clarice Starling in Silence of The Lambs, Karen Hill in Goodfellas and Mathilda in The Professional. Women who were presented with difficult choices and had to own their power and become stronger than their circumstances.
Agnes is the hero of her own story. She creates it, writes it and ends it in her thrilling fashion. The film is a love letter to women who feel different, women who feel human and messy and don’t always make the right choices.
VISUAL TONE AND STYLE: The visual tone and style will be dark and horror based. Similar to the style of “It Follows”, that sleepy small town stillness that leaves a pit in your stomach. Visually it will beautiful and cinematic, creatively using color to express the characters moods and where the story is headed. It will feel fast paced in the thrill as we feel Agnes’ anxiety.  
Since Agnes is set in the 90s, we will stay true to the early 90s era, using technology from that time, CD players and old TV sets.
The soundtrack should feel like an 80s horror film with a mix of classic rock from the 70s. The score should be cinematic and original. CHARACTERS: 
AGNES (20s): An outcasted young woman with a curious, intellectual mind. She’s a lovable tomboy and misfit who gets caught up when her obsessions with true crime manifests in the real world. A young Winona Ryder or Natalie Portman. A cunning yet antisocial young woman who lives in her own world.
During the start of the film we feel her feel, insecurities and helplessness but as the film flips and she owns her power we see the creation of a completely new character. By the end of the film we are mesmerized by her, her transformation is extraordinary and she becomes a cult hero.
THE MONARCH MURDERER (MID 40s): Our killer is physically intimidating, his size and strength is enough to allow Agnes to feel weak. A highly skilled huntsman, active outdoorsman, and overall a man’s man. He can also make a killer cocktail.
Mentally he’s going through a midlife crisis. He doesn’t feel like himself, he’s emotional and touchy, he smokes too many cigarettes, and feels the need to carry his legacy on yet he doesn’t have any children. At times he’s lovable and weirdly charming, feeling and grooving to old records he plays. His human nature makes him all the more terrifying. We ask ourselves how can we love a man that’s so horrible. There seems to be no method to his madness and he often spirals off like the joker or Jack Nicholson in The Shining. We fear his unpredictability and the fact that he’s a man with a terribly sick and twisted mind.
STRATEGY: ‘Monarch’ will be first shot as a 10-15 minute low budget short film and submitted to all major film festivals. The short will be used to promote the possibility of a feature film or television series furthering the character development and story.

Plain and simple, our goal is to raise $5,000 by mid-May at the earliest and end of June at the latest. Your contribution to the project will help cover crew costs, gear rental, crafty, post-production (editor, colorist, sound mixing), and festival submission fees.
Let's get specific:



Our perks include a credit at the end of the film, updates on the progress of the project, a chance to see early cuts of the film, and an invitation to a private screening with cast and crew.
If we don't reach our goal of $5,000, we will adjust our budget accordingly and make appropriate sacrifices pertaining to production and post-production.


The Impact
You have a chance to help our entire team realize a dream:

The dream of the film - we want to share this honest look into what it means to lose someone; to lose connection and the feeling of abandonment that comes with loss.
The dream of the team - Connor and Johnny are not the only ones with something to gain; our team is comprised of hard-working individuals who want to make this work a profession. This is one more step toward that goal.
Your participation in this campaign means getting this story out to the world and potentially impacting someone's life.


Risks & Challenges
There has never been a production that has run perfectly, but with enough money we can guarantee that we have a team of professionals backing our every move.

Other Ways You Can Help

Funding will essentially kickstart the project into production, the money we raise, getting the gears moving. All of our crew members are already working for free, however funding would allow us to put emphasis on the Set Design, Costume and Props in particular, constructing a fleshed-out and slightly surreal world the women reside in. As the costumes and many of the props need to be fabricated, it will require artist materials alongside a large amount of time and skill. However, with the process of filmmaking there are still an enormous number of costs to cover in order to enter production. As there is a Set to be built, we will have to rent out a studio space in order to shoot. Catering and Transport will be required to facilitate both the cast and crew, and extra transport costs will be required to take props, costumes, camera and lighting equipment to the Studio. Funding would give us the opportunity to hire essential camera and lighting equipment that would help to capture the absurdist world in which the characters reside. With donations, we can achieve a high end and aesthetically pleasing piece, your donations elevating this film to a higher production standard and enabling us to tell our story.</p><p>As we are unable to pay our actors daily rates due to having a limited budget, it is essential that we must cover for their expenses and catering, in gratitude.

Whilst at her tutor, Fonula was taught the harpsichord, but had three of her fingers broken when her tutor, Mr Adley, slammed down the case on her hands. She never played again... After a change of profession, Miss Fonula yields her crowns, scrubbing underneath the large folds of skin for a senile woman named Mrs Trudy Johnson, whose appetite has certainly beaten anorexia.

Sybilla now lines her pockets pouring slop onto young school children’s dinner plates, stood alongside trivial half-witted women who reek of pork fat, their excess of flaky skin on their hands making its way as a garnish on the top of the dishes.NARRATORS (NOT FROM SCRIPT) - The two Narrators will be played by seven year old boys, whose head's are trapped within a large wooden cabinet, surrounded by props. (See Photo below) The two narrators have very Posh Traditional southern British Accents, and the heavy make-up helps to emphasise their ghostly features.Overall the budget is broken down into seven main compartments: Art Department, Costume, Studio space, Actors’ Travel Expenses, Catering, Equipment Hire and Transport. Funding will essentially kickstart the project into production, the money we raise, getting the gears moving. All of our crew members are already working for free, however funding would allow us to put emphasis on the Set Design, Costume and Props in particular, constructing a fleshed-out and slightly surreal world the women reside in. As the costumes and many of the props need to be fabricated, it will require artist materials alongside a large amount of time and skill. However, with the process of filmmaking there are still an enormous number of costs to cover in order to enter production. As there is a Set to be built, we will have to rent out a studio space in order to shoot. Catering and Transport will be required to facilitate both the cast and crew, and extra transport costs will be required to take props, costumes, camera and lighting equipment to the Studio. Funding would give us the opportunity to hire essential camera and lighting equipment that would help to capture the absurdist world in which the characters reside. With donations, we can achieve a high end and aesthetically pleasing piece, your donations elevating this film to a higher production standard and enabling us to tell our story.As we are unable to pay our actors daily rates due to having a limited budget, it is essential that we must cover for their expenses and catering, in gratitude. Finally, with donations, there would be the possibility of submitting the film to Film Festivals around the world, spreading the theme of the social impact caused by oppression of creativity and individuality.Although the key crew members are making significant financial contributions to the film, it is still impossible to achieve the budget required to create the film with their contributions alone. Here is a breakdown of our costs:Below are a few stills from Finian's other works, which are are similar in the aesthetic that Felicity Fungus will be looking for.By contributing to the campaign, you will be supporting young artists in the creation of something unique, helping to tell a story that delves into socially-relevant themes. In return, we have both physical and digital perks in order to thank you. These rewards contain unique props from the film, Behind The Scenes material, the script and the film itself.Miss Felicity Fungus' Annual Maternity Tea Party is a significant story to tell in the current society we live in. We live in a world in which School shootings have become a normality, an every day event. We live in a world filled with disguised hatred for one another's culture. Why is this? This film aims to tackle the theme of oppression of individuality and creativity and how this may often lead to extremist behaviour, a matter that we as a society need to find the crux of.If you are not able to financially contribute, there are still plenty of other ways to help in raising awareness of the project. Sharing this campaign with your communities, friends and family will help this film move into production. Any awareness you can bring to this campaign and film would be hugely appreciated.'There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed.' The process of filmmaking is no different. Making a film, especially on a tight budget is a huge and often painful challenge, however having worked with all of the crew members before, we have a level of trust for one another. All of us have both University and Professional film experience and we will be able to overcome our obstacles, even if at times hard to see the solution. We are fully committed in making this film, even if we don't hit our full budget. However, problems can always be solved easier when there is money to solve the problems. Without donations, it would be a much more difficult process to tell such a story.For any information, please contact me at:FB: Finian ClarkeIG: @the_vanilla_nautilusMail: finianclarke@me.com",28.0,0,"1 Campaign
