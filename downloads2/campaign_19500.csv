<h3>Some Backstory...</h3>
<p><i>I LOVE WHITE MEN</i> started with a conversation in KFC in Singapore, when Renee and I were home for winter break. I told her, “I’ve only dated and swiped right on white guys ever since I moved to New York.”</p>
<p>She asked me why. I said I didn’t know. And so I embarked on this project, together with my core collaborators Renee and Nick, as a means to find out why - and it has proven to be messier and more complicated than I thought.</p>
<p>I examined conversations with my family, researched Singapore’s colonial history, read Reddit posts that broke my heart, interviewed white men who shamed me, and consolidated personal stories ranging from my unlikely friendship with a Swedish man when I was seven to my many one night stands in New York. I put all of them together, and still cause and effect eluded me.</p>
<p>As it stands now,<i> I LOVE WHITE MEN</i> is about the tension between “problematic” desires and social expectations. My desire for white men goes against the traditional Asian values that my parents and my country have worked hard to instil in me, and also against the progressive liberal ideals of equality. What do I do when my heart is unable to catch up with my mind? Why do I continue to worship white people despite knowing better? How do I go about undoing the inferiority complex that I have carried with me for decades? Can I?</p>
<p><i>I LOVE WHITE MEN</i> was also created in response to what we felt was a gap in mainstream knowledge about Asian culture and stories, and specifically for us, Singaporean stories. There are so few stories in our global canon that capture the nuance and complexity of who Singaporeans are as individuals and we hope, as ambitious as it sounds, that I LOVE WHITE MEN can dismantle assumptions, break through stereotypes, and ignite our curiosities about things that feel foreign to us.</p>

<h3>UPDATES!</h3>
<p>We have currently raised over £6,300!!!! Thank you to everyone for their support but we still have some distance to go. Help us reach our final goal!</p>
<h3>Why Yellow Cake?</h3>
<p>The project began by asking a question in a workshop ""What do people think about Nuclear Energy?"". We found that people had very strong stances, either completely in favour or avidly against. We then asked ""What do you know about Nuclear Energy?"" and we found the people knew very little! We then went to the streets to follow this up, with questionnaires and interviews, and again we found that people had very strong opinions but didn't know the facts. </p>
<p>Thus came the project Yellow Cake. Through our research we have found that many people in the UK have a ""fear"" of Nuclear Energy, and that Nuclear Energy is a cleaner energy source than coal, oil and gas.</p>
<p>We plan to expose the truths and lies about Nuclear Energy, enlighten our audiences and entertain.</p>
<p>We will represent these fears, we will provide the audience with the tools to question what they are hearing and seeing. Are you afraid? Why are you afraid? What should you be afraid of? </p>
<p>Yellow Cake is scheduled to have an initial showing in October, at the Bloomsbury Festival, as well as a second showing in Manchester (TBC). </p>
<h3>Why Theatre Company?</h3>
<p>In order to understand we must first ask, why? This question has driven the curiosity of Max and Eleanor all their lives in the pursuit of knowledge and understanding. This question was also a key stone to our artistic analysis: Why this play? Why now? It forces us to analyse every step we take and make sure that every one is purposeful and effective. This is why we are here, right now, presenting this to you.</p>
<p>Why Theatre is a new company exploring social and scientific themes. Max and Eleanor studied together at RADA and, during their time there, identified the type of theatre they wanted to make and what they thought was missing from the current theatrical landscape. Encouraged by their passion for science, psychology, philosophy, morality, and the complexity of human relationships, they set up Why Theatre in 2018.</p>
<p>Based between Lancashire and London, Why Theatre Company are focused on bringing content driven plays to audiences across the country. Endeavouring to make new relationships and inspiring people to never stop asking themselves and others: Why? </p>
<h3>VISION and IMPACT</h3>
<p>Climate change is a real threat to all of us. We hope that through this play we can give people the information they need in order to make an informed decision on Nuclear Energy and finally put a stop to the use of ""clean"" coal, ""natural"" gas and oil.</p>
<p>By combining immersive theatre and science we wish to fill the market gap and create a social impact that will influence all generations to engage with science and art.</p>
<p>We make theatre that is experimental and accessible; that connects with a larger demographic. There are science education shows for children but not many for adults. We want to change this</p>
<p>By working with theatre techniques which are fully embraced and realised in Europe, but are infrequently utilised in the UK, the work we create will be at the forefront of exploration for English theatre.</p>
<p>By putting on progressive and thought-provoking science theatre, we hope that people of all ages will be inspired to rediscover science whether it is in their professional lives or from the comfort of their couches.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, many articles have been written over the past few years about the increase in tribalism in our societies. This is why we want to create work that is brave, that engages with these divisions; work that encourages people to have difficult conversations whether they be about climate change, stem cell research, immigration or gender politics.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Through financial management we have drastically reduced the risk of this project to a very small percentile.</p>
<p>This is a technically ambitious project and will need a high budget to adequately tell this nuclear energy story. With advice from professional producers and technicians, we are able to follow the most cost effective route to help guarantee our success.</p>
<p>We believe that no-one should do their job for free, and so we think it is reasonable to ask that all artists involved with this project get paid at least equity minimum wage. With your help we can ensure this and provide fair living to everyone.</p>
<p>The money we are raising will ensure we are able to make high-quality theatre, where everyone is paid for their hard work. </p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We have managed to raise the first chunk of what we need (yay!) to cover rehearsal space, lighting and sound hire, theatre hire and will be getting marketing support from the Bloomsbury Festival. </p>
<p>However, we believe that no one should work for free. The money you give will help us to pay actors for two weeks of rehearsals, and their performances. We will also be bringing on a Technical Director to help with the creation and running of the show. </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't support us financially but are keen to get involved, then please talk to your friends and family about this project and spread the word. Talk to your neighbours about nuclear energy. Ask a nuclear worker about their job. </p>
<p>Science and theatre aren't incompatible; just ask us! Drop us an email at: whytheatrecompany@gmail.com</p>
<p>And don't stop asking yourself, and others... why?</p>

<h2><strong>Don’t you miss the experience of theatre live and in person?</strong></h2>
<p><br/>And how about if you shared space and time with the characters? What if you could</p>
<p>choose the perspective from which you witness the actions unfold?</p>
<p>Then you need to become a part of the<strong><i> Green Mist</i></strong> revolution.</p>
<p>●  Developed over three years at the Playwright/Directors Workshop at The Actors Studio, <strong><i>Green Mist</i></strong> is a play designed to be performed in a real house where the audience is free to choose their own path through the rooms and the action.</p>
<p>●  In order to be able to make this production come true, <strong><i>The Call Theatre</i></strong> is producing an immersion-infused Equity Staged Reading at <strong><i>Fiona's Bar</i></strong> in Flatbush, Brooklyn on June 13th and 14th.</p>
<p>●  This reading will give us the opportunity to: 1) develop the immersive aspects of the piece; 2) present the work to potential producers and investors interested in the play as a full-scale immersive installation.</p>
<p>●  In order to make this reading an engaging experience, we have a team of talented theatre artists who have been developing the play and will give voice to this experience.</p>
<p>●  Here's where we need your help! We need to raise funds to compensate these fantastic</p>
<p>artists for their time, craft, and commitment to bringing <strong><i>Green Mist</i></strong> to life! Can you help us to fight the mist?</p>
<p>In order to make this immersive reading succeed, we need to raise $2000. This will allow us to compensate everyone involved.</p>
<h2>Why should you get involved?</h2>
<p>The last 15 months of this pandemic have certainly been a financial challenge for Independent Theatre. However, this period has also been an opportunity to reflect on the diverse stories that need to be told in order to positively impact our society.</p>
<p><strong><i>Green Mist</i></strong> is not only an entertaining story, but a reflection of how privilege has shaped our society founded on the myth of meritocracy. As we re-emerge into the world after months of lockdown, we see our society with new eyes, empowering us to make change. This story will help audiences become more aware of the systemic disparities in our society and begin the work towards a more just world.</p>
<p><strong><i>The Call Theatre</i></strong> strives to revolutionize ways of engaging the community through the arts while making theatre and food more accessible to our neighbors. In this project we will be collecting non-perishable food items from the audience, using the food as props in the piece, then donating them to the Flatbush Friendly Fridge (the community fridge).</p>
<p>By supporting this project you are supporting:</p>
<p>●  Art accessibility.</p>
<p>●  The re-emergence of Independent Theatre.</p>
<p>●  The creation of stories that are relevant to our times.</p>

<p>Hey, I’m Fox Whitney an artist creating performative experiences that combine theater, dance and visual art. My transgender, queer, multiracial point of view is at the heart of my performance project, Gender Tender. I started Gender Tender in 2012 to feature myself and my first collaborator Will Courtney in performances that centered my conceptual point of view as an artist looking to center nonbinary perspectives. I am lucky to be able to continue to create experiences with the support of an interdisciplinary team of artists also interested in investigating the nature of queer and transgender personal relationships and histories as well as the surreal nature of transformation. Gender Tender engages a team of artists I cast that are willing to train in my methods modeled on the structures of sports teams, sitcoms and riots. </p>
<p>Featuring myself, Will Courtney, Sara Ann Davidson, Leon Finley, Hexe, Loren Othón, Kristi Krein, Kathryn Hightower, HATLO, Vanessa Dewolf, Emily Batlan, Ariel Burke, Hendri Walujo, Dani Tirrell, Vida Alapour, Christine Abdale, Tonya Lockyer, Minna Lee, Tyra Kopf, Peter Kohring, Wryly McCutchen and Corinne Manning MELTED RIOT is The biggest production I’ve done to date!  We have been in development on this piece since I became Velocity’s 2018 Artist in Residence over a year ago. I am grateful for the support of this program and we are thrilled that this project is presented by Velocity.</p>
<p>We are raising funds for our latest project that is so dear to all of us and I need your help to pay the artists  involved and to cover the cost of materials and technical equipment for the visual art elements and costuming.</p>
<p>You will make our artistic dreams come true. Funds go directly to the artists first to offer them a token of appreciation in exchange for their talents, time and passion. Your contribution supports experimental approaches to how we make art and what it means to make queer art now and we couldn’t do it without you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What do you need cash for?</h3>
<p>Good question. Heres’ a break down of how your gifts will be distributed:</p>
<p>100 dollars each to 10 additional main cast artists=1000</p>
<p>20 each to 12 additional performers joining low commitment = 240</p>
<p>Lighting, speakers and projectors: 500</p>
<p>Costumes: 100</p>
<p>Visual Art Installation Materials:400</p>
<p>Additional Documentation for rehearsals and performances: 300</p>
<p>Dramaturg: 100</p>Rehearsal Director: 300<p> </p>
<p>Total = 2, 840</p>
<p>Any amount we receive will first go to artist stipends and support roles and then be distributed to cover tech and materials. Any funds we raise beyond our goal will be used to increase the stipends that go to artists!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>THANK YOU, art life is hard out there....</h3>
<p>Your gift makes a huge difference in supporting the work that is so important to me. Gender Tender loves being a part of the Seattle dance and performance family and I am so inspired by the love, rigor and support I see flow through my community. We are so thankful for the ways our friends, families and audiences have supported our fundraising efforts in the past. Our previous campaigns...our Indiegogo for that GT classic Sync or Swim at Gay City in 2014 and our Hatchfund for the Renovation at NW New WOrks fest 2017...were successful thanks to YOU!! We appreciate your considering making another donation or making a donation for the first time towards bringing a GT experience into existence :)</p>
<p>MELTED RIOT is a project that is running on love, and the beauty of it (even your dad Fox gets emotional sometimes) is I know the stellar artists and production staff and crew would do this for nothing at all because it is that important to them to see the art they want in the world.</p>
<p>I swear to you, in my weirdo artist way, I’ll keep working to make the world I want come into being until someone makes me stop (LOL ain’t gonna happen). Knowing that people like you support this kind of experimentation and collaboration is what keeps me going even during the roughest patches. Thank you for reading this, if you can’t give, no need to, please share if you’d like and above all else we hope you’ll come to the show!</p>

<p>Anyone paying attention to theatre in the last decade will have noticed the explosion in “immersive” productions,"" proclaims Forbes. </p>
<p>Forget about seat selection. In an immersive theatre production, you won't simply watch from a cramped row of the theatre. The action happens all around you, and our ""stage"" is a 20-room, three-story building, transformed into an entire world full of dark delights and deeds for you to explore.</p>
<p>New York Times describes immersive theatre as ""shows that spill out of the usual confines. Shows that envelop you, or otherwise turn you into an agent of your own experience.""</p>
<p>Let your whims and desires guide which characters and storylines you wish to follow as you explore the space at your own pace, unearthing meticulously crafted Victorian details and experiencing secret moments unique to the path you chose. </p>

<p>Deep Into Darkness is produced by Third Wheel Productions, an experiential production company based in Vancouver, Canada. We create shows that range from large-scale immersive spectacles to one-on-one encounters that foster personal, meaningful interactions with audiences.</p>
<p>We've assembled an insanely talented team for Deep Into Darkness, including our production designer John R. Taylor who is a Jessie Award winner, as well as Sean William, our sound designer, who was nominated for the Western Canadian Music Awards for his work on the short film Small Fish. Our dramaturg Stephen Atkins is currently writing a book called “Crosspoints: An Embodied Acting System” and teaches this method in South London. Our fight choreographer Nic Harrison has done choreography for Bard on the Beach as well as the Vancouver Opera. And finally, our wonderful costume designer CS Ferguson who is not only an extremely talented designer but also a historian who grew up in Baltimore; where Poe himself died! Crazy and magical if we do say so ourselves.</p>
<p>Our cast members work on many different TV shows and films in Vancouver, including Van Helsing, Snowpiercer, Six, Ice, Sacred Lies, Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, Ghost Wars, Siren, The Detour, Final Destination 5, Robert Kirkman’s Secret History of Comics and so many more.</p>

Our performance will transform The Cultch into a dark Victorian home trapped in a fairy dream world.</p>
<p>We'll purchase the raw materials to bring this world to life and fill entire spaces both big and small, from the floor to the ceiling, including the detailed story elements that you might even find inside desk drawers, cabinets and behind paintings.

<h3>Broken Codes: A New Play by Stephanie Garrison</h3>
<p>Danny and Val fight for survival and freedom against the powerful Megaport. This suspenseful, quick-witted, original play Broken Codes, has been developed over the past two years by playwright Stephanie Garrison and producer/director Megan Kosmoski. Set in a near-future New Orleans and coastal Louisiana, this innovative script tackles the existential challenges facing our home through the lens of the sci-fi genre. Coastal land loss, gentrification, and classism intersect in this thrilling spy-drama.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>When, Where, What?</h3>
<p>May 2020. You arrive at the Fortress of Lushington, a black box theatre in New Orleans, LA.</p>
<p>Upon entry, illuminated on the stage you see a lived-in New Orleans neighborhood bar on the coast, warm and dark, built of rich old wood, friendly but with some darker corners for more secretive and plotting conversation. Not long after the show starts you are thrown into the MegaPort, a sterile industrial center off the Louisiana coast. The world unfolds with a projection design that sprawls across the space. You are immersed in the battle for the survival of the New Orleans coastal community. </p>

<h2><u><strong>What is the Picher Project: </strong></u></h2>
<p>The Picher Project, a new musical, explores abandoned mining town of Picher, Oklahoma through its 100 year history. The town that once was the largest producer of lead and zinc in the world became the EPA’s #1 Superfund site, deeming Picher the most toxic place in America. After native lands were mined out for years, leaving the earth damaged and causing other environmental and health crises to arise, Picher officially dissolved in 2013. Picher, a town that meant the world to its citizens, was founded and destroyed by the mining industry, leaving its population with no way to return home. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are attempting to raise $10,000 to fund the developmental process of our musical. Creating a musical is expensive: rehearsal space, supplies, time, expenses for residencies, performances, and actors all require some sort of funding. Our proposed breakdown is as follows:</p>
<p>40% - Developmental Workshop Process- including Residency, travel expenses, supplies, and space.</p>
<p>20% - Directly into Research and Dramaturgy, conducting further research and interviews</p>
<p>20% - Demos EP - creating a professional Demo EP</p>
<p>10% - Rehearsal Space </p>
<p>10% - Website development, Branding Development, and Project relationships</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Picher Project is more than just a musical, it’s a call to action. The environmental disasters that happened in Picher are not the first and surely won’t be the last. If we do not learn from our mistakes, how can we grow as a society? The Picher Team, after spending several months researching and writing, travelled to Northeast Oklahoma and Picher. Getting to see, firsthand, the true magnitude of what has happened there, and hear the stories of people who called Picher home, gave the project new meaning. While we are creating a musical, we hope to also be pushing our audiences to truly minimize the impact we have on the earth. By using art in conjunction with activism, we hope to continue to grow both our story and mission.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The Picher Project has been working hard for nearly a year in their own free time to write and create this show. After all of that, and funding our own trip to Picher, we are seeking your help in the next steps of our developmental process. This funding will allow us to continue our work and bring the show to life early next year.  We are thrilled to be heading to Maine with a group of actors for a week-long residency to really focus on our script and musical arrangements. We plan to compensate our actors so they can take a week away from the city to work with us. The next step is a demo album, which we plan to fully record in New York. Additionally, on October 23rd, we will have a concert at Feinstein/54 Below. Finally, there will be a full production in New York early next year. Funding is necessary for each step along the way, and we hope you can help us make this all a reality.</p>
<p>Since our trip to Picher, we have received opportunities to bring our project to Maine, New Jersey, and back to Oklahoma to work on, and present our show. If we can keep working to produce the show next year, we eventually hope to bring the show back down to Oklahoma and present it for the community it was written about.</p>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>At the risk of stating the obvious, the dance world is a small one. I've been lucky to have sustained relationships with performing artists whom I consider colleagues, mentors and friends. Many of them have crossed paths with each other. This is the roster of artists. You can read below to hear about how I know them.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Ellen Bartel</strong> (Austin, TX)</li>
<li>
<strong>Erika Batdorf and Kate Digby</strong> (Toronto, Canada and Manhattan, Kansas)</li>
<li>
<strong>Clarence Brooks and Michael Foley</strong> (Boca Raton and St.Petersburg, Florida/Paris, France)</li>
<li>
<strong>Nina Haft and Company</strong> (Oakland, California)</li>
<li>
<strong>Jessica Kondrath</strong> (Los Angeles, California)</li>
<li>
<strong>Stephanie Liapis</strong> (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)</li>
<li>
<strong>Prometheus Dance </strong>(Boston, Massachusetts)</li>
</ul>
<p>While a freshman at Bates College in 1994, I had the honor of performing in a piece choreographed by Bates Alum <strong>Michael Foley</strong>. Over the course of my four years at Bates, Michael came back several times to set work and teach class. Each of his visits to campus was so nourishing to my soul. I admired positive teaching and realize now the massive impact it had on my own style of teaching.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535917677/fn92esczp1sxuuo75w6p.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>After graduation, I moved to Boston and started taking class with Tommy Neblett and Diane Arvanites at The Dance Complex. In 2001, I joined their company: <strong>Prometheus Dance</strong>. Dancing with Prometheus was the first time I felt part of a tribe - artists who were athletes, actors, poets - who poured their souls into the rehearsal process and were fierce performers.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535824545/aj8ychajg8boa24lbwwa.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In 2003, I was living in Berkeley, California when I started taking class at Shawl-Anderson Dance Center. It was there that I met <strong>Nina Haft</strong> and was introduced to her artistry and rejuvenating classes. I relish the intelligence and empathy in Nina's work.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536164609/y6nfxoosqncja70tgd8c.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In 2004 while visiting Austin, Texas, I attended a performance at Cafe Dance in which <strong>Ellen <strong>Bart</strong>el</strong> had a piece of choreography. It was a solo that resonated deeply with me, and I immediately started keeping tabs on her work from afar. This performance will be my third time presenting her work. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535824501/ajxv6jeiqhhxeknfygnr.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/>In 2006, after moving to New York City, <strong>Kate Digby</strong> (who had been an acquaintance in Boston) invited me to audition for her company's residency at The Yard. A longer story would have a very interesting turn of events but suffice it to say that Kate did <u><i>not</i></u> select me yet I ended up joining the company a few months later and remained a member of her company for five years. It was during Kate's rehearsal process that I discovered where vulnerability can lead in the creative process. Her insights continue to shape my experiences both on and off the stage.</p>
<p>It was at the residency at The Yard where I met <strong>Erika Batdorf</strong> - Kate's guest and collaborator - when she worked with Digby Dance. Erika stripped away our dancerly ways and helped each of us discover our rawness, our authenticity...or as I think of it: ""performing without acting."" Erika is an arresting performer and such a gifted teacher.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535824577/jtsqnusepjjnoqbe46r5.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As a dancer in NYC, it's a pretty common experience to find a teacher and stalk them. You follow them to wherever they teach, you work around your conflicts and find them. When I first moved to NYC, <strong>Stephanie Liapis</strong> was that teacher for me. I adore her energy, her movement, her taste in music, her deep plie. When I took her class and when I watched her perform, she reminded me of why I dance.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535824775/rv8kinkxigypa49uadri.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Similarly, as a dancer in NYC, it's often the case that you find fellow dancers who are doing the same things you are...at the same time...with lots of the same people. <strong>Jessica Kondrath</strong> and I took class alongside each other, rehearsed in studios adjacent to each other, sat in the audience at the same performances, taught classes at the same time, etc. Having peers in the dance world is crucial for support and professional development, and I have deep respect and appreciation for Jessica.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535917266/e3uhivypdvvibcihm9zc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Finally, in March 2018 I had performances with Sokolow Theatre Dance Ensemble and <strong>Clarence Brooks</strong> was a Guest Artist. Once we met at rehearsal, we realized just how many mutual acquaintances we had. We traced so many different dance relationships and were amazed that we were just being introduced to one another. Clarence is a treasure - his generosity of spirit is unparalleled and his talent is astounding. Watching him dance is a privilege.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The goal is to raise $5000.</p>
<ul>
<li>I will be renting the theater for performances, technical and dress rehearsals and hosting a reception on stage after each performance. Funds will go towards this cost.</li>
<li>I would like to offer each performance group a small stipend of $500 to offset their travel and housing costs</li>
</ul>
</div><div>

Many of them have crossed paths with each other. This is the roster of artists. You can read below to hear about how I know them.


Ellen Bartel (Austin, TX)

Erika Batdorf and Kate Digby (Toronto, Canada and Manhattan, Kansas)

Clarence Brooks and Michael Foley (Boca Raton and St.Petersburg, Florida/Paris, France)

Nina Haft and Company (Oakland, California)

Jessica Kondrath (Los Angeles, California)

Stephanie Liapis (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)

Prometheus Dance (Boston, Massachusetts)

While a freshman at Bates College in 1994, I had the honor of performing in a piece choreographed by Bates Alum Michael Foley. Over the course of my four years at Bates, Michael came back several times to set work and teach class. Each of his visits to campus was so nourishing to my soul. I admired positive teaching and realize now the massive impact it had on my own style of teaching.

After graduation, I moved to Boston and started taking class with Tommy Neblett and Diane Arvanites at The Dance Complex. In 2001, I joined their company: Prometheus Dance. Dancing with Prometheus was the first time I felt part of a tribe - artists who were athletes, actors, poets - who poured their souls into the rehearsal process and were fierce performers.

In 2003, I was living in Berkeley, California when I started taking class at Shawl-Anderson Dance Center. It was there that I met Nina Haft and was introduced to her artistry and rejuvenating classes. I relish the intelligence and empathy in Nina's work.

In 2004 while visiting Austin, Texas, I attended a performance at Cafe Dance in which Ellen Bartel had a piece of choreography. It was a solo that resonated deeply with me, and I immediately started keeping tabs on her work from afar. This performance will be my third time presenting her work. 
In 2006, after moving to New York City, Kate Digby (who had been an acquaintance in Boston) invited me to audition for her company's residency at The Yard. A longer story would have a very interesting turn of events but suffice it to say that Kate did not select me yet I ended up joining the company a few months later and remained a member of her company for five years. It was during Kate's rehearsal process that I discovered where vulnerability can lead in the creative process. Her insights continue to shape my experiences both on and off the stage.
It was at the residency at The Yard where I met Erika Batdorf - Kate's guest and collaborator - when she worked with Digby Dance. Erika stripped away our dancerly ways and helped each of us discover our rawness, our authenticity...or as I think of it: ""performing without acting."" Erika is an arresting performer and such a gifted teacher.

As a dancer in NYC, it's a pretty common experience to find a teacher and stalk them. You follow them to wherever they teach, you work around your conflicts and find them. When I first moved to NYC, Stephanie Liapis was that teacher for me. I adore her energy, her movement, her taste in music, her deep plie. When I took her class and when I watched her perform, she reminded me of why I dance.

Similarly, as a dancer in NYC, it's often the case that you find fellow dancers who are doing the same things you are...at the same time...with lots of the same people. Jessica Kondrath and I took class alongside each other, rehearsed in studios adjacent to each other, sat in the audience at the same performances, taught classes at the same time, etc. Having peers in the dance world is crucial for support and professional development, and I have deep respect and appreciation for Jessica.

Finally, in March 2018 I had performances with Sokolow Theatre Dance Ensemble and Clarence Brooks was a Guest Artist. Once we met at rehearsal, we realized just how many mutual acquaintances we had. We traced so many different dance relationships and were amazed that we were just being introduced to one another. Clarence is a treasure - his generosity of spirit is unparalleled and his talent is astounding. Watching him dance is a privilege.
What We Need

The goal is to raise $5000.

I will be renting the theater for performances, technical and dress rehearsals and hosting a reception on stage after each performance. Funds will go towards this cost.
I would like to offer each performance group a small stipend of $500 to offset their travel and housing costs


What else....
Come to a performance!

<p>MARYSHELLEYSHOW is a variety show presented by dirtbag teenage geniuses  Mary Shelley and Emily Dickinson, as they struggle with friendship, loneliness, the stresses of parenting, the slipperiness of fame and historical importance, and the desire to host one damned party without Lord Byron messing it all up.

<h1>Who We Are!

</h1>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This summer we are producing Much Ado About Nothing and all
its wit, romance, and mayhem, set in the electric 1970s. Much Ado About Nothing
runs from July 29 to August 13 at the Performance Works Outdoor Stage on
Granville Island. We are hoping to raise $2,600 to help cover production and program
costs. This is where you come in! Help us continue to make this amazing program
free for the audience and affordable for the participants. </span></p>

<p></p>
<h1><b>What Do We Do?</b></h1>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;font-weight: normal;"">What does it mean to support the Teen Shakespeare Program (TSP) and who does it
affect? Every summer, CTYP opens its doors to 16 vibrant, unique and talented
teen actors’ ages 13-18 who have a passion for Shakespeare and performance.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Led by Head Instructor Mike Stack, students embark on an intensive
pre-professional training process where they build not only skills that will
carry them forward in the professional theatre industry, but skills that they will carry with them throughout their lives. The program builds confidence, teamwork and communication skills and fosters a strong sense of community. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<i>“…watching them both with highlighters and pencils
marking their scripts so painstakingly is the most beautiful and incredible
sight for us. I think it is so important that we give each child something to
feel good about themselves for – something to shine at – and drama is what
Carousel has given my boys. </i><i>“ 
</i>
</blockquote>
<p>                                                                                                     -  Parent of TSP
Participants </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The program culminates in a two-week run of the production at the
Performance Works Outdoor Stage on famed Granville Island where the actors learn about the joys,
challenges, and surprises that come along with performing outdoors for a live audience. In 26 years,
over 500 youth have come through the program and made Shakespeare a part of
their summer.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">For the Teen Shakespeare Program, the Bard’s comedies,
tragedies and histories are not the stuffy domain of highbrow academics. Whether
you are 2 or 92, a professor of English Lit or someone who doesn’t know who
Shakespeare is, TSP productions are accessible to all. We are dedicated to
providing high quality Shakespeare interpretations that highlight the talent
and accomplishments of young people in our community while being free for
everyone to enjoy.  </span></p>
<blockquote>
<i>“</i><i>Starting
out in Hamlet, I was nervous even for our first read-through, stumbling over
the words and meter. Now, I am confident on stage performing Shakespeare.”</i>
</blockquote>

Laura Reynolds, Former TSP Participant</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Bursaries are available to support students
with demonstrated financial aid and each year, a merit-based scholarship is awarded to a participant who is going on to pursue a
post-secondary education in theatre or anything else! Actors, scientists, and
politicians alike represent where Teen Shakespeare alumni find their calling but
it is their love of theatre, ignited by TSP, that unites each and every one of
them. </span></p>

<h1 style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Risks, Challenges,
and FAQ</b></h1>
<p><b>What happens if we
don`t reach our goal?</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> As the old proverb goes, the show must go on. The
show is slated to run but your contribution will help CTYP take the program and
production to the next level. Your support allows us to provide bursaries and scholarships to current and future students and continue the long tradition of FREE Teen Shakespeare performances for years to
come. </span></p>
<p><b>Why don’t you just
raise the cost of tuition?</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> One of our key values is that the
program should be accessible to all youth in Metro Vancouver no matter what
their family’s financial circumstances are. We have been so lucky to have had a
wide variety of participants from all over the Lower Mainland - from West Van to
Coquitlam. Rising production costs and the importance of maintaining a high quality experience for participants and audiences necessitated a small increase in tuition in 2014, and we don’t want to raise the
tuition any more. In the coming years we want to make the program even more
accessible, and our dream is to make it free for every participant! </span></p>
<p><b>Why don’t you just
charge for tickets?</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> As ticket prices around us
rise, CTYP wants to ensure that everyone has access to live theatre. Theatre brings
communities together and we believe that every person should be able to experience it. A few years ago, to make it more convenient for our audience, we introduced pre-reserved seats for a nominal $5 reservation
fee. We also offer seat cushions and blanket rentals by donation as well as run a
concession which has drinks, hot dogs and other treats. But at the end of the
day, it is crucial to us that show remains free for audiences to attend.</span></p>
<p><b>Will I get a tax
receipt? </b>I<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">f you donate through Indiegogo we are unable to
issue you a tax receipt. If you would like one, please feel free to donate directly
to CTYP at <a href=""https://tickets.carouseltheatre.ca/TheatreManager/1/logindonation=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://tickets.carouseltheatre.ca/TheatreManager/1/logindonation=0</a></span></p>
<p><b>I
can’t afford to donate…What can I do?</b> <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We work in the arts – we get it. If you are unable to donate
financially, there are other ways you can help support us. You can:</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><span> A) VOLUNTEER- the TSP village runs through the
hard and generous work of an amazing team of volunteers and we are always
looking for more help. Sign up here: </span><a href=""http://www.carouseltheatre.ca/about-carousel-theatre/volunteer/shift-signup/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.carouseltheatre.ca/about-carousel-theatre/volunteer/shift-signup/</a></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">B) Pass it along- We know that not everyone can donate but
that someone might know a great-great aunt in Tulsa or have an in with our next
celebrity guest. E-mail, Share, Like, and Repost @Carouseltheatre with #TSP2016</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">C ) Come see the show. Without an audience, our show will
just be a bunch of talented teens hanging out in a park. The audience is who
brings theatre to life. We run from July 29<sup>th</sup>-August 13<sup>th</sup>

This summer we are producing Much Ado About Nothing and all
its wit, romance, and mayhem, set in the electric 1970s. Much Ado About Nothing
runs from July 29 to August 13 at the Performance Works Outdoor Stage on
Granville Island. We are hoping to raise $2,600 to help cover production and program
costs. This is where you come in! Help us continue to make this amazing program
free for the audience and affordable for the participants. 



What Do We Do?
What does it mean to support the Teen Shakespeare Program (TSP) and who does it
affect? Every summer, CTYP opens its doors to 16 vibrant, unique and talented
teen actors’ ages 13-18 who have a passion for Shakespeare and performance.
Led by Head Instructor Mike Stack, students embark on an intensive
pre-professional training process where they build not only skills that will
carry them forward in the professional theatre industry, but skills that they will carry with them throughout their lives. The program builds confidence, teamwork and communication skills and fosters a strong sense of community. 

“…watching them both with highlighters and pencils
marking their scripts so painstakingly is the most beautiful and incredible
sight for us. I think it is so important that we give each child something to
feel good about themselves for – something to shine at – and drama is what
Carousel has given my boys. “ 


                                                                                                     -  Parent of TSP
Participants 
The program culminates in a two-week run of the production at the
Performance Works Outdoor Stage on famed Granville Island where the actors learn about the joys,
challenges, and surprises that come along with performing outdoors for a live audience. In 26 years,
over 500 youth have come through the program and made Shakespeare a part of
their summer.
For the Teen Shakespeare Program, the Bard’s comedies,
tragedies and histories are not the stuffy domain of highbrow academics. Whether
you are 2 or 92, a professor of English Lit or someone who doesn’t know who
Shakespeare is, TSP productions are accessible to all. We are dedicated to
providing high quality Shakespeare interpretations that highlight the talent
and accomplishments of young people in our community while being free for
everyone to enjoy.  

“Starting
out in Hamlet, I was nervous even for our first read-through, stumbling over
the words and meter. Now, I am confident on stage performing Shakespeare.”

                                                                          - 
Laura Reynolds, Former TSP Participant
Bursaries are available to support students
with demonstrated financial aid and each year, a merit-based scholarship is awarded to a participant who is going on to pursue a
post-secondary education in theatre or anything else! Actors, scientists, and
politicians alike represent where Teen Shakespeare alumni find their calling but
it is their love of theatre, ignited by TSP, that unites each and every one of
them.

Risks, Challenges,
and FAQ
What happens if we
don`t reach our goal? As the old proverb goes, the show must go on. The
show is slated to run but your contribution will help CTYP take the program and
production to the next level. Your support allows us to provide bursaries and scholarships to current and future students and continue the long tradition of FREE Teen Shakespeare performances for years to
come. 
Why don’t you just
raise the cost of tuition? One of our key values is that the
program should be accessible to all youth in Metro Vancouver no matter what
their family’s financial circumstances are. We have been so lucky to have had a
wide variety of participants from all over the Lower Mainland - from West Van to
Coquitlam. Rising production costs and the importance of maintaining a high quality experience for participants and audiences necessitated a small increase in tuition in 2014, and we don’t want to raise the
tuition any more. In the coming years we want to make the program even more
accessible, and our dream is to make it free for every participant! 
Why don’t you just
charge for tickets? As ticket prices around us
rise, CTYP wants to ensure that everyone has access to live theatre. Theatre brings
communities together and we believe that every person should be able to experience it. A few years ago, to make it more convenient for our audience, we introduced pre-reserved seats for a nominal $5 reservation
fee. We also offer seat cushions and blanket rentals by donation as well as run a
concession which has drinks, hot dogs and other treats. But at the end of the
day, it is crucial to us that show remains free for audiences to attend.
Will I get a tax
receipt? If you donate through Indiegogo we are unable to
issue you a tax receipt. If you would like one, please feel free to donate directly
to CTYP at https://tickets.carouseltheatre.ca/TheatreManager/1/logindonation=0
I
can’t afford to donate…What can I do? We work in the arts – we get it. If you are unable to donate
financially, there are other ways you can help support us. You can:
 A) VOLUNTEER- the TSP village runs through the
hard and generous work of an amazing team of volunteers and we are always
looking for more help. Sign up here: www.carouseltheatre.ca/about-carousel-theatre/volunteer/shift-signup/


B) Pass it along- We know that not everyone can donate but
that someone might know a great-great aunt in Tulsa or have an in with our next
celebrity guest. E-mail, Share, Like, and Repost @Carouseltheatre with #TSP2016
C ) Come see the show. Without an audience, our show will
just be a bunch of talented teens hanging out in a park. The audience is who
brings theatre to life. We run from July 29th-August 13th
at the Performance Works Outdoor Stage on Granville Island, Vancouver BC.
Reserve seats in advance for $5 or just, well, show up! It’s free!
When do I get my
perks? The campaign ends on July 30th which is our opening night
so expect your perks in the mail by August 10th. You will be mentioned

at the time of your donation. Video thank you’s will be distributed online. Tangible
perks like printed photos and signed posters can be shipped across Canada and
the USA. Shippable perks for donations of $250 or more can be sent

</h3><p>MayWorks Winnipeg is a multi-disciplinary festival, which focuses on
the relationship between working class issues and their artistic
expression in song, poetry, photography, dance, art and drama.</p>
<p>As part of this year’s annual festival, MayWorks is pleased to
premiere the Winnipeg production of the internationally renowned play, “MY NAME
IS RACHEL CORRIE” — drawn from the diaries of American activist and International
Solidarity Movement member, Rachel Corrie, and edited by actor Alan Rickman &amp;
journalist Katherine Viner.</p><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">OUR FUNDRAISING GOALS AND WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU DONATE</b><br/></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In connection with May 2016’s play launch, MayWorks Festival of
Labour and Arts is now seeking donations in support of the successful premiere
of “My Name Is Rachel Corrie” — donations, collected to offset many critical
production costs, including: actors’ wages, set design expenses, venue rental
fees, promotion and other miscellaneous items.</span></p>
<p>The production history of “My Name is Rachel Corrie” — from its
initial 2005 London staging, to its infamous 2006 New York cancellations — has in
the past been mired in controversy and opposition owing to some of its political
content in respect of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. </p>
<p>In the spirit of artistic expression, freedom of speech and the spirit
of Rachel herself (who was killed in the protection and service of vulnerable
Palestinian peoples), we are asking you to donate what you can towards MayWorks’
successful launch of Rachel’s life story.</p>
<p>We have established a fundraising goal of $7,500.00 (CAD), which,
with your generosity and commitment to festivals and works which speak to the
relationship between working peoples and the arts, is tenable over the course
of the next 4 weeks.</p>
<p>Our performances of “My Name is Rachel Corrie” are scheduled for May
5, 6, 7, 13 and 14, 2016 at Winnipeg’s Irish Association of Manitoba. All shows
directed by Andraea Sartison of One Trunk Theatre, with a cast that includes:
Gwendolyn Collins, Heather Russell, Gislina Patterson, Liz Whitbread, Brittany Thiessen and Erin Shwartz.</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">For details on our 5 scheduled performances of “My Name is Rachel

<br/></div>","""MY NAME IS RACHEL CORRIE"": a fundraising appeal for the Winnipeg MayWorks launch of the critically acclaimed stage play
MayWorks Winnipeg is a multi-disciplinary festival, which focuses on
the relationship between working class issues and their artistic
expression in song, poetry, photography, dance, art and drama.
As part of this year’s annual festival, MayWorks is pleased to
premiere the Winnipeg production of the internationally renowned play, “MY NAME
IS RACHEL CORRIE” — drawn from the diaries of American activist and International
Solidarity Movement member, Rachel Corrie, and edited by actor Alan Rickman &
journalist Katherine Viner.OUR FUNDRAISING GOALS AND WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU DONATEIn connection with May 2016’s play launch, MayWorks Festival of
Labour and Arts is now seeking donations in support of the successful premiere
of “My Name Is Rachel Corrie” — donations, collected to offset many critical
production costs, including: actors’ wages, set design expenses, venue rental
fees, promotion and other miscellaneous items.
The production history of “My Name is Rachel Corrie” — from its
initial 2005 London staging, to its infamous 2006 New York cancellations — has in
the past been mired in controversy and opposition owing to some of its political
content in respect of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
In the spirit of artistic expression, freedom of speech and the spirit
of Rachel herself (who was killed in the protection and service of vulnerable
Palestinian peoples), we are asking you to donate what you can towards MayWorks’
successful launch of Rachel’s life story.
We have established a fundraising goal of $7,500.00 (CAD), which,
with your generosity and commitment to festivals and works which speak to the
relationship between working peoples and the arts, is tenable over the course
of the next 4 weeks.
Our performances of “My Name is Rachel Corrie” are scheduled for May
5, 6, 7, 13 and 14, 2016 at Winnipeg’s Irish Association of Manitoba. All shows
directed by Andraea Sartison of One Trunk Theatre, with a cast that includes:
Gwendolyn Collins, Heather Russell, Gislina Patterson, Liz Whitbread, Brittany Thiessen and Erin Shwartz.For details on our 5 scheduled performances of “My Name is Rachel
Corrie,” please visit: www.mayworks.org
or on Facebook by searching ""My Name is Rachel Corrie: Winnipeg MayWorks 2016.""
ABOUT “MY NAME IS RACHEL CORRIE” AND RACHEL CORRIE HERSELF""MY NAME IS RACHEL CORRIE"" — From the journals of Rachel Corrie as edited by actor Alan
Rickman and journalist Katherine Viner • Directed by Andrea Sartison • Performed by:
Gwendolyn Collins, Heather Russell, Gislina Patterson, Liz Whitbread, Brittany Thiessen and Erin Shwartz • Presented with the assistance of the Tara Players Theatre
Company and the Irish Association of Manitoba.
RACHEL ALIENE CORRIE (April 10, 1979 – March 16, 2003)
was an American Evergreen State College student and member of the International Solidarity Movement (ISM) who traveled to the Gaza Strip during the Second Intifada. She was killed by a Caterpillar D9R armoured bulldozer operated by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) while protesting the destruction
of a house by the IDF in the Gaza Strip — apparently acting as a human shield.
The details of the events surrounding Rachel's death, as she stood between an
Israeli bulldozer and a Palestinian home are disputed. While an Israeli military investigation
ruled the death to be an accident, the ISM maintains that Rachel was run over
deliberately. In 2012, The Haifa District Court, in a lawsuit filed by Rachel's parents, ruled that her death was an accident, and rejected the claim that
Israel was at fault over Rachel’s death.
The play's script is taken from excepts of Rachel’s journals and
correspondence over the last decade of her life. The picture it paints is of a
young woman with a ""fire in her belly"" — an unquenchable thirst for
justice, for hope and a poignant belief that a single person can change
the world. She is both ordinary and extraordinary, a regular
American genX-er, yet set aside from her generation because of
her talent and worldview.

It had become clear that this was going to be the beginning of exploring unusual venues for their work. It is a deliciously, gritty, re-done space that allows the opportunity to avoid the old ""the actors are on a stage and I watch them"" pattern, and to make sure that Reasons to Be Pretty quickly becomes a very visceral, shared, and close experience between the audience and the actors.</font></span></span></font></h3>

</div></div>","Our Story
Rogue Theatre Company began with two actors who wanted to create risky, compelling, and thought-provoking theatre in Toronto. It has evolved into a dream of building a community and network of like-minded individuals, and, out of that, supporting and nurturing each other's works and skills. Diana Bentley and Brooke Morgan are ambitious, driven young women who have spent the past several years studying in New York and London and have arrived back in Toronto to become a force in the bustling scene here. 
After the success of their one-act play ""DEUCE"" at the Lab Cab Theater festival this past September, they began their quest finding a play to really sink their teeth into. Reasons to Be Pretty came into their hands after much searching and debate. It is a guts-out, heart-ripping, fireball show that opens the door for you to reflect on your own betrayals, fights with lovers -- and the work you put into looking good before you walk out the door every morning. It is everything they hoped for: a story about really hearing and really listening, and about the power of words and the stories we tell ourselves and others to make ""sense of it all.""
When the idea of the show quickly turned into a plan of attack, they began discussions on locations. Many trips to galleries and studios later, they spoke with Jamie Webster, a member of the N/A Collective, a not-for-profit studio space for artists located on Dundas West, who graciously offered up his space for the dates of the run. It had become clear that this was going to be the beginning of exploring unusual venues for their work. It is a deliciously, gritty, re-done space that allows the opportunity to avoid the old ""the actors are on a stage and I watch them"" pattern, and to make sure that Reasons to Be Pretty quickly becomes a very visceral, shared, and close experience between the audience and the actors.
Rogue Theatre grew out of dreams of building a community of actors, producers, stage hands, directors, and collaborators who are all after the same common goal of creating meaningful work and answering the age-old question: ‘""Is this worth my time?"" At the end of the day we are storytellers, lovers of emotionally open and free interactions, and ambitious to make our mark in Toronto. It is our hope that you share with us the enthusiasm of what we are seeking to accomplish and supporting us in any way possible. 
The show will run from November 28th to December 4th at the N/A Collective, with shows from Tuesday through Sunday at 8pm and matinees on both Saturday and Sunday at 2pm. 

The Impact
With any artistic endeavour comes the challenge of money. The only way our production and company can work and can produce such exciting material as Reasons to Be Pretty is with your support. We are trying to raise $3000 privately so that the show can happen. Our hope is also that, if we meet our target in fundraising, we can put money towards our spring show. This money will ensure that Rogue Theatre will grow and become a voice for a riskier, sexier, and more enlivened type of theater in Toronto. 

What We Need & What You Get
All money that is raised through our efforts on Indie-Go Go will be put towards the production costs of Reasons to Be Pretty: renting  the space both for the production and in the rehearsals leading up to it, lighting design, sound effects, the set, costumes, right down to the posters for our advertising, and payment  individual members of our Equity Co-op for their services in bringing the production to life.  From rehearsal to production we need $3000.00. 

Other Ways You Can Help
If money is not an option, there are other ways you can help. The mouth is a wonderful thing, especially when it is used to share good information -- like, how to come and see Reasons to Be Pretty when it hits the Toronto stage November 28th. Tell your friends. Tell your Mom. Hell, tell your 8th grade gym teacher. We would love to have each and everyone of you. Our Story",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>School Dance </i>is the story of a group of endearingly awkward teens and their hormone-fueled quest for social acceptance. Set in the special kind of hell that is the high school dance, this award winning comedy is a nostalgic and boisterous theatrical party.<br/><br/><i>School Dance</i> is about acts of bravery. About facing your own self loathing and coming out on top. Inspired by ‘80s cartoons and John Hughes films, the show features helpful unicorns, a hole in the space-time continuum, invisible teens, an epic bike race set to Bonnie Tyler, and an incredible amount of awkward dancing. <br/><br/><i>School Dance</i> marks Action/Adventure’s first foray into creating work for both adults and teenagers. Australian playwright Matthew Whittet wrote the play with the Adelaide, Australia-based Windmill Theatre Co. for audiences both young and old. The show connects with teenagers where they are at and adults where they used to be, with just enough awkward nostalgia to make everybody happy. It’s a highly personal work that, just like its central protagonists, is funny, sad, scary, weird, really stupid, endearing, and kind of repulsive.</p>
<p>Action/Adventure is proud to present the North American premiere of:<br/>SCHOOL DANCE<br/>By Matthew Whittet<br/>Directed by Tamara Carroll<br/>March 17th-April 9th<br/>Thursdays-Sundays 8:00 PM<br/><br/>Featuring:<br/>Christy Bigelow<br/>Noelle Eaton<br/>Jon Gennari<br/>Brian Kuwabara<br/>Pat Moran<br/>Sam Reiter<br/>Zoë Rudman<br/>Samson Syharath<br/><br/>Stage Manager: Nicole Gladwin<br/>Sound Designer: Richard Moore<br/>Costume Designer: Sydney Dufka<br/>Set Designer: Tyler Buswell<br/>Lighting Designer Kim Williams</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This is an ambitious show, in every way! For ten years, Action/Adventure has been producing inventive, accessible theatre funded almost entirely with ticket sales - which is a wonderful testament to our devoted audience. In order to produce this North American premier, we have to set our budgetary sights higher. We are committed to paying our collaborators, and providing a quality, engaging theatre experience with high production values. We were awarded a Regional Arts and Culture Council (RACC) project grant, which has helped us bring the project to the stage. Additional funding will expand our ability to reach as many young audience members as possible - with free tickets, actor engagement, and school outreach - in addition to maintaining our artistic commitments,  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Reaching young audiences with work that respects and challenges them is more important now than ever. Action/Adventure has a long history of performing for non-traditional theatre audiences, and we are choosing to be intentional about including teens under that umbrella. By taking some of our financial dependence off of ticket sales, we can ensure that every young adult who wants to see the show can do that!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Whatever you can donate will be wildly appreciated, but, more than anything, we want you to see the show! We're running now through April 9th, and tickets are available on our website (actionadventure.org) Can't make the show? We would love it if you could spread the word! Like us on Facebook!

<p><b><i>Last year</i></b>,
with the help of supporters like you, we began to build a community that honors
creating opportunities for women in theatre.<span>  </span>Due to a serious
void in opportunities for women in meaningful and powerful positions both on
and off the stage, we created the Philadelphia Women's Theatre Festival.  <br/></p><p>Now, it's year two and as we quickly approach our 2016 Festival, we <b>need</b> <b>your</b> <b>help!</b></p>
<p>Your support is crucial to our success and central to our mission. <b>We know how important the arts are to you
and we would like to ask you to make a tax-deductible gift.</b>  Your donation will help us present
performances and educational opportunities ranging in style and scope during
our <b>2<sup>nd</sup> Annual Summer Festival from August 3<sup>rd</sup>
– 7<sup>th</sup>, 2016</b>.</p>
<p>PWTF fosters and encourages women in the performing arts by offering unique
opportunities for exposure, professional and artistic and personal development
and a platform for performance.  We <b>foster and encourage women in the
arts of all disciplines: directors, playwrights, performers, designers, technicians,
administrators and <i>more</i>.</b> </p>
<p><b><i>This year</i></b>, we are being hosted as an
Organization in Residence in the <b>Ira Brind School of Theater Arts at the
University of the Arts</b> in the heart of Philadelphia. We are incredibly
grateful for the opportunity to produce work in an institution that has
valued the creation of art for <i>one hundred and forty years</i>. (Happy
Anniversary, UArts!)  </p>
<p><b><u>2016 Festival events<span> 
include:</span></u></b><br/>
<br/>
· Original Staged Readings<br/>
· 4 Presented Works (devised theatre, solo performance and one-act plays)<br/>
· A Cabaret and Honoree Ceremony<br/>
· 3 Professional Development Workshops to coincide with performances <br/>
· A Stand-Up Comedy Hour <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>
</p><h3>Our Impact</h3>

Last year, we took a <b>RISK</b>.  We asked, <b>‘Philly, what the
f%$@&amp;’?</b>
<p>And, with your help, we launched the Philadelphia Women’s Theatre
Festival to celebrate the creativity of women. </p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>We provided resources, support and exposure to women hungry for
opportunity.</p>
<p><span>·<span>

At some point in our lives, we all take risks to pursue our passions –Our

shouldn’t stop YOU!</span></p>
<p>Last year, we took a risk.<span>  We
spoke up. Last year, we asked ‘Philly, WTF??’ And you asked with us!</span></p>
<p>We asked <b>WHY</b>…</p>
<p>Why are male playwrights produced more frequently than female
playwrights?<span>  Why is male leadership the rule
and female leadership the exception<i>?  Why</i> do we have to play by <i>anyone
else’s</i> rules? </span></p>
<p>We also asked...</p><p><b>WHY</b> aren’t artists paid properly for their work?<span>  WHY should we be satisfied with little to no

a Risk.  Change the story. 



Last year,
with the help of supporters like you, we began to build a community that honors
creating opportunities for women in theatre.  Due to a serious
void in opportunities for women in meaningful and powerful positions both on
and off the stage, we created the Philadelphia Women's Theatre Festival.  Now, it's year two and as we quickly approach our 2016 Festival, we need your help!
Your support is crucial to our success and central to our mission. We know how important the arts are to you
and we would like to ask you to make a tax-deductible gift.  Your donation will help us present
performances and educational opportunities ranging in style and scope during
our 2nd Annual Summer Festival from August 3rd
– 7th, 2016.
PWTF fosters and encourages women in the performing arts by offering unique
opportunities for exposure, professional and artistic and personal development
and a platform for performance.  We foster and encourage women in the
arts of all disciplines: directors, playwrights, performers, designers, technicians,
administrators and more. 
This year, we are being hosted as an
Organization in Residence in the Ira Brind School of Theater Arts at the
University of the Arts in the heart of Philadelphia. We are incredibly
grateful for the opportunity to produce work in an institution that has
valued the creation of art for one hundred and forty years. (Happy
Anniversary, UArts!)  
2016 Festival events 
include:

· Original Staged Readings
· 4 Presented Works (devised theatre, solo performance and one-act plays)
· A Cabaret and Honoree Ceremony
· 3 Professional Development Workshops to coincide with performances 
· A Stand-Up Comedy Hour 
Our Impact

Last year, we took a RISK.  We asked, ‘Philly, what the
f%$@&’?
And, with your help, we launched the Philadelphia Women’s Theatre
Festival to celebrate the creativity of women. 
· 
We provided resources, support and exposure to women hungry for
opportunity.
· 
We received more than 100 artist and playwright applications.
· 
We presented 7 shows, including new works created by local women.
· 
Created
professional development programming and a panel of Philadelphia’s female arts leaders
· 
Showcased the work of more than 40 directors, designers and  
performers
·

<p>
</p>
<p>We had a really beautiful show that was
made over a whole year. <i>Two Legged Animal</i>
was Ziggy’s first full length performance produced by Ausform, the show
previewed at the Wickham Theatre in February 2015 for one night only to a
completely sold out audience. Their reaction was wonderful and we were
incredibly proud. </p>
<p>Sadly the video that we commissioned of the
show for booking purposes got corrupted and all we have is still photography.
The problem is that the show is so unique and as this was first work with Ziggy
as a lead artist; we are now unable to obtain bookings for what is a great
show. </p>
<p>If you could donate a little (or a little

We had a really beautiful show that was
made over a whole year. Two Legged Animal
was Ziggy’s first full length performance produced by Ausform, the show
previewed at the Wickham Theatre in February 2015 for one night only to a
completely sold out audience. Their reaction was wonderful and we were
incredibly proud. 
Sadly the video that we commissioned of the
show for booking purposes got corrupted and all we have is still photography.
The problem is that the show is so unique and as this was first work with Ziggy
as a lead artist; we are now unable to obtain bookings for what is a great
show. 
If you could donate a little (or a little
bit more!) to help us remount the show in order to document it you’d help to
secure the future of a show which we have worked on for so long & help to
bring it to hundreds of audiences in the UK and beyond.

<p><i>“Basically, I’m afraid of everything in life, except filmmaking.”                                     Lars Von Trier</i></p>
<p>‘Lars’ is a journey inside the Danish director Lars Von Trier's mind. All the play is performed in English language. We chose to abstain from direct quoting his movies. We generated instead – working on analogies – an independent imaginary by letting Von Trier’s biographical experiences dialog with H.C. Andersen’s fairy tales. With ‘Lars’ we decided to overturn psychoanalysis’ perspective. We are not interested in treatment for human pathogen microcosm, we are charmed by their fables. We write streams of consciousness, we align mind worlds, we create systems of signs, interactive conceptual boxes, searching for the alchemy of a new irony. </p>
<p>
</p><p><i>""Lars"" é un viaggio nella mente del regista danese Lars Von Trier. Lo spettacolo è in lingua inglese. Abbiamo scelto di astenerci dal citare direttamente i suoi film, generando invece -lavorando sulle analogie- un immaginario indipendente facendo dialogare le esperienze biografiche di Von Trier con le favole di H.C. Andersen. Con ""Lars"" abbiamo deciso di ribaltare l'angolazione prospettica della psicoanalisi. Del microcosmo patogeno dell'uomo non ci interessano le cure, ci seduce il folklore.

<p> Since January 2014 we have been investigating Lars Von Trier as an author, as an artist and as a public person.

First and foremost, thank you all for even taking the time to read this pitch. Theatre is a collaborative process not just between actors, directors, stage managers, and designers; it is a collaboration with our audience as well.  Without you, there would be little point to making art in the first place. </p><p><i>A Steady Rain </i>came about because of an assignment given to Cedric Houle (Denny) and myself one and a half years ago during our Acting 2 class under the guidance of Dr. Nicole Hodges Persley.

First and foremost, thank you all for even taking the time to read this pitch.

<h3>WHO IS INKED DANCE?</h3>
<div> INKED Dance questions the social structures of American culture through various mediums to provoke thought and challenge ambiguity in social stigmas.  Through outreach, performance, and education: Inked Dance promotes tolerance and acceptance from the cultural down to the individual level of understanding in order to recognize stereotypes and subvert against them.  <br/>
</div>
<div>Inked dance operates under the direction of Brian Moe, artistic director and composer.  Brian Moe received his MFA in dance from CSULB in 2012, but also has degrees in Psychology, Dance, and Music (BA, BFA, AAS respectively).  He has received numerous recognitions and awards for his ability to do both music and choreography to create truly cohesive works on a large scale.  </div>
<div>The importance of the 'Nightmares' production can not be put into words.  This is the closing performance of INKED Dance's inaugural season that will take place OCTOBER 25th and 26th, 2013 at 8:30 pm.  We have graciously been able to co-present with Leo Garcia at Highways Performance Space in Santa Monica.  This large, evening length performance blends together film, dance, and theater to create a surreal nightmarish environment where the audience will come to realize their fears.  A successful presentation at the space will help INKED Dance become a force to be reckoned with in the LA Dance scene.  It will also help generate interest in the company as we strive to become a fully recognized non- profit organization.  </div>
<div>With your generous contributions, we will be able to cover the costs of filming (light, camera, editing, set), costumes, lighting design, and on stage sets.  We will reward your donations handsomely with our deep gratitude, humble thanks, and or course all of the perks listed in the donation section.    If our goal is not met, we will still use all the funds gathered to put on this performance ti the best quality and standard that we can afford.  </div>
<div>Highways is known for presenting experimental and cutting edge performance art, dance, and film.  Our presentation of 'Nightmares' is an important asset to the community at large as that it comments on the fears we all share as human beings.  And it leaves us with a very important realization that ""our own Nightmares are only as bad as we allow them to be.""</div>
<div>If you would like to help us further, we are always asking for help with promotions on social media forms.  Word of mouth is still a popular method of information transference, but nothing is easy or as visible as sharing a link on Facebook.  If you believe in this project as much as we do, and you would like to do your part above and beyond the contribution you have made, we ask that you help us promote the event to make other aware of this truly unique evening of dance and film.</div></span></span></div>","WHO IS INKED DANCE?

<p><b>THE POWER OF THE PLAY </b></p>
<p>Both my parents are and were incredible artists. I have long since given up the idea of having a corporate 9-5 job.  What I aspire to be is a writer, producer and creator of magical projects that make a difference in other people’s lives. This is why I wrote MY PRIVATE REVOLUTION. I feel that my play has the voice of many.  It speaks to abuse, loneliness and depression and how we can overcome these problems.</p>
<p><b>THE PLAY’S STORY</b></p>
<p>MY PRIVATE REVOLUTION is dynamic one-woman show about overcoming abuse and finding healing and forgiveness.  It is a rhythmical and powerful journey addressing social issues and celebrating the power of individual choice.  A thought provoking, transformational and heart wrenching play filled with drama, music and dance. </p>
<p><b>THE SUPPORT FOR THE PLAY</b> </p>
<p>When I produced my previous two plays, <i>Indiegogo </i> was only a concept in someone’s mind and I had to work five jobs to make those plays come to life! With much appreciation to the creators of Indiegogo I’m hoping to raise $35,000 to produce my new play and work only two jobs!  After raising the funds I can then spend the remainder of my time focusing on rehearsing and creating and awesome show for you!</p>
<p>Most of the funds will go for the venue and personnel.  In addition, because of my love of music, I have original songs that we will need to pay for the musical rights. We also have to pay for rehearsal space, marketing, lighting and sound. It is such an amazing learning experience creating an Off-off Broadway play. Especially if you want it to feel like Broadway!!!</p>

<p>On the 21st night of September 2013 I’m turning the big 4-0. The theatre part of me is currently knee-deep in rehearsals for an evening of epic proportions. At first I was planning an extravaganza showcasing my original song, dance, and performance art parodies laced with the elite talent I’ve encountered over my 39 years gracing the stages of Earth. Yet, that seemed limiting. It would have much more impact if this party had a purpose; the intent of helping as many children from across the globe as possible who desperately need miraculous transformation in their lives. So I prayed on it with the Cloud Stud, and BAM, I got my answer.</p>
<p>It’s called <strong><span class=""title2"">“Cirque Du Julie:</span></strong><strong class=""title1""> Sur Le Mur“ </strong>(a homage to my circus brethren and the gloved one). This is staged on Saturday night September 21, 2013 at the Berkeley Carteret in Asbury Park, NJ with an 8pm curtain. You’ll experience an arena of comedy and tragedy in a way you’ve never seen before.</p>
<p>At the heart of the event is <strong><a href=""http://www.rayofhopefoundation.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“The Ray of Hope Foundation”.</a></strong> Out of all of the non-profits I’ve been involved with, this one I owe my spiritual life to.  To give a bit of background; every child deserves to know what happiness and love is.

On the 21st night of September 2013 I’m turning the big 4-0. The theatre part of me is currently knee-deep in rehearsals for an evening of epic proportions. At first I was planning an extravaganza showcasing my original song, dance, and performance art parodies laced with the elite talent I’ve encountered over my 39 years gracing the stages of Earth. Yet, that seemed limiting. It would have much more impact if this party had a purpose; the intent of helping as many children from across the globe as possible who desperately need miraculous transformation in their lives. So I prayed on it with the Cloud Stud, and BAM, I got my answer.
It’s called “Cirque Du Julie: Sur Le Mur“ (a homage to my circus brethren and the gloved one). This is staged on Saturday night September 21, 2013 at the Berkeley Carteret in Asbury Park, NJ with an 8pm curtain. You’ll experience an arena of comedy and tragedy in a way you’ve never seen before.
At the heart of the event is “The Ray of Hope Foundation”. Out of all of the non-profits I’ve been involved with, this one I owe my spiritual life to.  To give a bit of background; every child deserves to know what happiness and love is. Since 2001, The Ray of Hope Foundation continues to reach out to children suffering from debilitating illnesses, and giving these kids and their families support in any way they need during this crucial time in their lives: spiritual support, financial backing, community involvement, listening and prayer. And then there are the countless miracles this group has played a part in. I’m talking about the stuff they write books and make movies about, people. Mind-blowing healings from all walks of life (click here to read numerous accounts of personal miracles that occurred through the Skop Rosary Society including my own).
We all know this… there’s power in numbers. So which part of the Cirquel will you join? Perks galore for each category. Every copper penny beyond production costs fills The Ray of Hope Foundation’s cup til it runneth over and over. In return, all of the lives transformed by those donations are attributed to you because you took the leap of faith and thought enough to spare the dime.
Please, search your heart and let’s together take massive action to make this possible.
Ladies and Gentleman, this is YOUR Cirque Du Julie, Sur Le Mur…
A crash, a flash, a beam of light explodes, In time to drums, in time to shouts, rhapsody. It’s off the wall, it’s slicing through your heart The speed of light, the roar of celebration, a player’s part. A life is spent in exploration of Delight, of song, of dance, of love And what these do when thrust from one good soul Toward another waiting with mind and arms opened wide! And if that mind is a bit askew? One that sees as very few do? A mind the lions tamed, Incapable embarrassment, much less shame? A brain shot one too many times from a cannon? Say, the mind of… Julie Gannon? Simply grit your teeth and hope your inner child’s still inside, And go for the ride. Revisit a time and place untouched and pure Cirque du Julie: Sur Le Mur A crash, a flash, a beam of light enflames, A ray of hope! And so begins the passions, the dance, the games, Played for charity, played for love, played for all to win. A ray of hope, A gift from within given to those in need of the voice of a violin, The leap of a dancer, the warmth of a clown. A ray of hope, A gift from within given by you as you join the circus that just pulled into town, Just as you always wanted to.

<p>BLESSINGS. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I am Deatrice Nicia De'Lovely, a Northern CA self-published poetess and dramatist. I have been creating inspirational poetry for decades now catering to a predominantly female audience. M<span>y poetry emphasizes the pain, purpose and power of women. As a trauma survivor of a fast urban upbringing, where not even my beloved mother was exempt of abuse, I obligate my literature to encouraging assertiveness, confidence, and self-esteem to the neglected. All of my literature derives from events relevant to me, yet instead of entertaining being once victimized I use these experiences to heal, empower and commend US (universal sisterhood) as we continuously thrive in rapidly changing conditions. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Urban Roses Soliloquies is more than a performance; it is a testament of perseverance through poetry and dance by an electrifying ensemble of local talented performers including the extraordinary DANCE-A-VISION of Oakland, CA. This evocative performance acknowledges the struggles, strengths, trials and triumphs of the urban female. It is the exposure of taboo living and the discovery of vigor, self-worth, love and healing during the storms. It is my goal to share this great Urban Roses Soliloquies production with the Northern CA most often demoralized, trivialized and unrecognized Bay Area young women. Your contributions will enable me to present Urban Roses Soliloquies to diverse multitudes of girls and women of Northern CA; those in need of encouragement and those worthy of applause. Urban Roses Soliloquies gives recognition to every female, empowering and commending through verse and dance. My belief...</p>
<ol>
<li>EVERY GIRL has a voice.</li>
<li>EVERY WOMAN has a story. </li>
<li>EVERY PERSON has a purpose.</li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Like many visionaries and entrepreneurs I rely on my regular 9-to-5 to fund my projects. On August 15, 2013 I took a leap of faith and self-produced my first Urban Roses Soliloquies show. Theatrically it was a success, but with limited funds came many limitations. For instance, it is my dream to put on this performance free of admission for the women and girls of our Bay Area shelters, group homes, foster homes, high school and advocacy nonprofit organizations. Although the show went on for paying guests, I was unable to produce a second show for those whom I consider my target audience.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">My goal is to raise $8,000.00 so that I can share my uplifting production with US (universal sisterhood). The anticipated $8,000.00 will help fund the following necessities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Venue reservation fee</li>
<li>Recitalists compensation</li>
<li>Marketing materials</li>
<li>Audio/visual equipment rentals</li>
<li>Professional Photographer and Videographer</li>
<li>Wardrobe and make-up</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Stage props and other miscellaneous items</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Now as my most sincere gratitude to you for your kind generosity I have prepared some very heartfelt perks. All contributions are highly regarded, as the impact of every dollar will be felt by someone’s mother, someone’s daughter, someone’s grandchild and so-on. Urban Roses Soliloquies is more than my production; it is my ministry. </p>

I am Deatrice Nicia De'Lovely, a Northern CA self-published poetess and dramatist. I have been creating inspirational poetry for decades now catering to a predominantly female audience. My poetry emphasizes the pain, purpose and power of women. As a trauma survivor of a fast urban upbringing, where not even my beloved mother was exempt of abuse, I obligate my literature to encouraging assertiveness, confidence, and self-esteem to the neglected. All of my literature derives from events relevant to me, yet instead of entertaining being once victimized I use these experiences to heal, empower and commend US (universal sisterhood) as we continuously thrive in rapidly changing conditions. 
Urban Roses Soliloquies is more than a performance; it is a testament of perseverance through poetry and dance by an electrifying ensemble of local talented performers including the extraordinary DANCE-A-VISION of Oakland, CA. This evocative performance acknowledges the struggles, strengths, trials and triumphs of the urban female. It is the exposure of taboo living and the discovery of vigor, self-worth, love and healing during the storms. It is my goal to share this great Urban Roses Soliloquies production with the Northern CA most often demoralized, trivialized and unrecognized Bay Area young women. Your contributions will enable me to present Urban Roses Soliloquies to diverse multitudes of girls and women of Northern CA; those in need of encouragement and those worthy of applause. Urban Roses Soliloquies gives recognition to every female, empowering and commending through verse and dance. My belief...

EVERY GIRL has a voice.
EVERY WOMAN has a story. 
EVERY PERSON has a purpose.

Like many visionaries and entrepreneurs I rely on my regular 9-to-5 to fund my projects. On August 15, 2013 I took a leap of faith and self-produced my first Urban Roses Soliloquies show. Theatrically it was a success, but with limited funds came many limitations. For instance, it is my dream to put on this performance free of admission for the women and girls of our Bay Area shelters, group homes, foster homes, high school and advocacy nonprofit organizations. Although the show went on for paying guests, I was unable to produce a second show for those whom I consider my target audience.
My goal is to raise $8,000.00 so that I can share my uplifting production with US (universal sisterhood). The anticipated $8,000.00 will help fund the following necessities:

Venue reservation fee
Recitalists compensation
Marketing materials
Audio/visual equipment rentals
Professional Photographer and Videographer
Wardrobe and make-up
Security
Stage props and other miscellaneous items

Now as my most sincere gratitude to you for your kind generosity I have prepared some very heartfelt perks. All contributions are highly regarded, as the impact of every dollar will be felt by someone’s mother, someone’s daughter, someone’s grandchild and so-on. Urban Roses Soliloquies is more than my production; it is my ministry. 
If you are interested in becoming a volunteer of the Urban Roses Soliloquies production please contact me via email at poetryandcupcake@gmail.com. I am Deatrice Nicia De’Lovely, and I AM an Urban Rose.
Much love Love LOVE to You All!

<p><strong> </strong>Lady Champ (Chicago Champions) and Tonic (Chicago Tribe) are re-introducing an event in the heart of Logan Square (Logan Square Eagle monument) to help younger generations be inspired by artists and dancers of their peers. The basis of our mission is to bring a free all ages event to the community, and let those who are interested express themselves freely with confidence. Our event will consist of a bboy/bgirl battle, all styles battle, and an exhibition battle, along with live music, an art showcase, and dance cyphers. This event will be held at the Logan Square Eagle monument, off of N Kedzie and N Milwaukee in Chicago, IL 60647.</p>
<p>What will your contributions help us achieve? Your donations will help with the Dj's, judge's, and competitor's compensations. This event is a non-profit event and all our fundraising goals will pay for fees associated with the event. The remaining amount will be given to a Boocoo youth cultural center (Evanston, IL) that encourages art/dance/music. In today’s society, where art and music is lacking in the youth, we want to bring the hunger for creative thinking and promote artistic freedom.</p>

<p><strong>In Other Words Theatre proudly presents their devised production: <em>MUSE</em>. </strong> </p>
<p><strong>About The Project: <em>MUSE </em></strong> <strong>FAQs</strong></p>
<p>Q:  What the heck is devised theatre?</p>
<p>A:  Devised theatre is theatre created collectively in the rehearsal hall by the artists—versus following a finished, polished script created by a playwright. Making theatre in this way offers unique, surprising and engaging performances for artists and audiences.</p>
<p>Q:  But I’m seeing scenes of the play in the video, has it already been created? </p>
<p>A:  No, this is just the beginning.  We have begun a scaffold (a sort of outline, rough script or storyboard that serves as a starting place and can be deconstructed, re-written, turned upside down or even tossed away if needed) with some scene and character ideas, and this is what we used for the filming. We wanted to give you an idea of where we are going with the play.</p>
<p>Q:<em>  </em>So, what’s it about?</p>
<p>A:<em>  <strong>MUSE</strong></em>  tells the tale of two women: Grace, who is an institutionalized, musically gifted young woman, and her nurse, who carries a guilty secret from the past and wants desperately to connect with her charge.  Grace’s caregivers—in an attempt to reconnect her with the outside world—have forbidden her to escape into her music. </p>
<p>The story takes place inside of Grace’s head.  The audience serves as her imagination. Over the course of the play, Grace and the audience create a song together as the story of shattered loyalty and the power of the imagination unfolds around them.</p>
<p>Q:  Cool! What do you need the money for?</p>
<p>A:  Grace's imagination is both a key character and a setting in the play, and creating the world inside her head with live sound, interactive video projections and light will be crucial to its success.  In Other Words is incredibly fortunate to have a new media artist on board to help us bring Grace’s inner life to the stage. Now all we need is the funding in order to pay for these design and production elements.  Our goal is to raise $2,500 for new media equipment and artist fees.</p>
<p>Please note: It is our policy to always pay for people rather than for things whenever possible.  The lion’s share of this funding will go to the artists who will make the technical magic happen.</p>

About The Project: MUSE  FAQs
Q:  What the heck is devised theatre?
A:  Devised theatre is theatre created collectively in the rehearsal hall by the artists—versus following a finished, polished script created by a playwright. Making theatre in this way offers unique, surprising and engaging performances for artists and audiences.
Q:  But I’m seeing scenes of the play in the video, has it already been created? 
A:  No, this is just the beginning.  We have begun a scaffold (a sort of outline, rough script or storyboard that serves as a starting place and can be deconstructed, re-written, turned upside down or even tossed away if needed) with some scene and character ideas, and this is what we used for the filming. We wanted to give you an idea of where we are going with the play.
Q:  So, what’s it about?
A:  MUSE  tells the tale of two women: Grace, who is an institutionalized, musically gifted young woman, and her nurse, who carries a guilty secret from the past and wants desperately to connect with her charge.  Grace’s caregivers—in an attempt to reconnect her with the outside world—have forbidden her to escape into her music. 
The story takes place inside of Grace’s head.  The audience serves as her imagination. Over the course of the play, Grace and the audience create a song together as the story of shattered loyalty and the power of the imagination unfolds around them.
Q:  Cool! What do you need the money for?
A:  Grace's imagination is both a key character and a setting in the play, and creating the world inside her head with live sound, interactive video projections and light will be crucial to its success.  In Other Words is incredibly fortunate to have a new media artist on board to help us bring Grace’s inner life to the stage.

<p>Our Story...<br/></p>
<p>We are an artist-driven company committed to a spare, but evocative aesthetic that places the characters and their journey at the forefront of an audience’s consciousness. We're dedicated to presenting big ideas in small spaces and providing the most visceral and immediate experience possible for our audiences. We're called ""The Shop"" and we plan to offer a wide range of theatrical commodities, from exciting new works to bold interpretations of classic plays. Come sample our wares! <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The Production...</p>
<p>Our first production will be the world premiere of a new work by Judith Goudsmit called LOVE IN TRANSIT and will run this summer from July 28th through the 30th at The Red Room, here in New York City. The play is a comic fantasy presenting the lives of two unique individuals, a man and a woman, and their struggles with love, longing, and loneliness in a world of relentless momentum.</p>

<h3>Hey Folks!</h3>
<p>Hey Folks, we're ""Team Four Messages"" and we've got a show going up this spring in NYC. And it's going to cost A LOT of money! Please help to defray the costs of producing a show in NYC. The show, ""Four Messages,"" is a beautiful (we think) musical (sort of) about love, faith, and forgiveness. We believe in it and we hope you will, too! Any help you can give will help ease the tremendous expenses involved.</p>
<p>Team Four Messages has membership in Fractured Atlas, so your contribution is TAX DEDUCTIBLE! Fractured Atlas is an organization that helps artists attempting to raise money for projects, such as we're doing with ""Four Messages."" Membership in Fractured Atlas can allow supporters of ""Four Messages"" to make TAX-DEDUCTIBLE contributions! Fractured Atlas a long-standing, reputable organization that has helped countless artists and artistic organizations produce work.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why ""Four Messages"" needs your help.</h3>
<p>We're not attempting to fund the entire project with this campaign. If we raised $5000, it wouldn't pay for this production. If we raised $10,000, it wouldn't pay for this production. If we raised...oh God, let's stop here before it gets nauseating.</p>
<p>So we're asking you  -friends, supporters, countrymen- to join in as producers on this show. We're ""all in"" on this one, folks, and could use some help.</p>
<p>""Four Messages"" is a show about love, faith and forgiveness, some things we think the world could use a little more of. And maybe this show can help make that happen.</p>
<p>And did we say there were perks? Depending on how much you donate, you could receive one or more of Ned Massey's award-winning albums. You could even receive a fully-produced song written especially for you! Or even a private, in-your-own-home house concert for you and your friends by Ned Massey! But be aware that since your donation is tax deductible, if you decide to take a perk, I have to assign a reasonable dollar value to the perk and your tax deduction will be less the value of the perk -hence for many of you who would like the full donation amount as a tax deduction, NOT choosing a perk might be the best route!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know times are incredibly tough these days, so if you can't make a monetary contribution to the show, we totally understand. But maybe you can tell others about the project, or share the link to this page. Or come see the show! Or just send that good energy! It's all appreciated!</p>
<p>We can't thank you enough for your time and consideration. </p>

My name is Rob Tode, and I am the new Theater Director for Capital High School in Santa Fe. This is my first year teaching at Capital, and I arrived to find a beautiful theater space in slight disrepair and some amazing kids with little direction. I also was informed, after I ordered the scripts for my first play, that not only was my budget Zero Dollars ($0), but as a result of the previous teacher not paying for some royalties, my new budget was Negative three hundred (-$300) :-(</p><p>I decided to mount the production of ""The Actor's Nightmare"", by Christopher Durang, since I could do it with very little money, and because I love the play. We just finished a successful run of performances, but had a fairly small turnout, audience-wise. My plan is to take this production to the Eastern New Mexico University High School Drama Festival in Portales, NM, and we need your help...<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We made enough from our school performances to pay our old debt and to pay for our entrance fees for the festival, but thats about all we could cover.</span></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need</h3><p>I want to raise $3000 to at least pay for the students accommodations and the cost of the district bus. So here is what the funds will be used for:</p><ul>
<li>Bus Transportation to and from the Festival (approximately $1500-we have to use and pay for a district bus)</li>
<li>Hotel Accommodations for the student actors/crew/chaperones (approximately $1500-25 kids, 3 chaperones for 3 nights)</li>
<li>Any extra funds raised will go towards meals for the students</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><div>You can make a difference to enrich the lives of the students involved. The impact would be immeasurable. None of my students have ever been to this festival before, and they will get the opportunity to share their talents with other students from across New Mexico &amp; Texas. They will also be attending <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">other productions as well as </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">numerous theatre workshops offered during the 3 day festival.

My plan is to take this production to the Eastern New Mexico University High School Drama Festival in Portales, NM, and we need your help...We made enough from our school performances to pay our old debt and to pay for our entrance fees for the festival, but thats about all we could cover.What We NeedI want to raise $3000 to at least pay for the students accommodations and the cost of the district bus. So here is what the funds will be used for:
Bus Transportation to and from the Festival (approximately $1500-we have to use and pay for a district bus)
Hotel Accommodations for the student actors/crew/chaperones (approximately $1500-25 kids, 3 chaperones for 3 nights)
Any extra funds raised will go towards meals for the students
The ImpactYou can make a difference to enrich the lives of the students involved. The impact would be immeasurable. None of my students have ever been to this festival before, and they will get the opportunity to share their talents with other students from across New Mexico & Texas. They will also be attending other productions as well as numerous theatre workshops offered during the 3 day festival. Your help will truly make this an amazing educational experience for these kids.
Other Ways You Can HelpIf you cannot donate, please consider sharing our campaign link on your page. It would mean the world to us. If you read all the way down to here, thank you so much for hanging in there. Only 2 more sentences after this. I wanted to keep this as short as possible, so feel free to email me if you have any other questions about our journey. And we will be updating this page with pictures and videos during the life of this fund raiser :-)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>Who We Are</strong></h2>
<p>MayDay stages impossible situations in order to tell stories about our everyday experiences. We are an emerging theatre ensemble working collaboratively to devise performance. We find different and exciting ways to tell stories; stories that explore what it is to fail and what it is to be human.</p>
<p>MayDay is Anna Clover, Ilayda Arden, Mawgaine Tarrant-Cornish, Jackie Vitale and Jessica Brooks.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What We Need</strong></h2>
<p>The premier of <em>This Is A Reconstruction</em> will be at <a href=""http://www.oxfordhouse.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Oxford House Theatre</a> in Bethnal Green, East London on 7th and 8th September 2012.</p>

You’ll be helping us design weird and wonderful ways to show the end of the world!</p>
<p>The funds we raise here will be put towards our existing budget and spent in the following ways:</p>
<p>$148 will pay for two weeks rehearsal space in the run up to our show.</p>
<p>$217 will cover our public liability insurance- a must for any public performance.</p>
<p>$125 will go towards our print marketing – flyers and posters so that people know about our work.</p>
<p>$210 will help us create the set for our show and contribute to costumes and props.</p>

<h2>A <em><strong>Punk Rock</strong> </em>Premiere</h2>
<p>Zeitgeist Stage Company (Boston, MA) presents the East Coast professional premiere of Simon Stephens' <em><strong>PUNK ROCK</strong> </em>from May 3 through May 25 at the Boston Center for the Arts. </p>
<p>Contemporary and unnerving, <strong><em>Punk Rock </em></strong>explores the pressures, underlying tensions, and potential violence amid a group of affluent, articulate, angst-ridden seventeen-year-old students as they flirt, bully, and pontificate their way through their senior year and college prep in a British Secondary School.</p>
<p>Inspired by the tragic student violence at Columbine High School in April of 1999<em>,</em> <strong><em>Punk Rock</em></strong> analyzes the root causes of such violence. Based on the playwright’s experience as a teacher, Stephens describes the play as <em>“The History Boys</em> on crack.”</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Help Fund the Show's Physical Environment</h2>
<p>Zeitgeist Stage is looking to fund the production values including sets, lights, &amp; costumes.  The show is set in the upper library of a British grammar school.  The students attending the school all wear uniforms, as do all secondary school students in Britain. </p>
<p>The funds will help create the physical environment, the book shelves, their school books, their uniforms, their book bags, and the lighting in that library.   </p>
</div>

<h2>More about the Show</h2>
<p><em><strong>Punk Rock</strong></em> looks at the pressures these secondary school students experience as they prepare for their college entrance exams.  An act of bullying results in an act of violence, causing everyone including the perpetrator and the audience to ponder the question ""Why?"".   There will be talkbacks after every performance with mental health professionals attending the Sunday matinee talkbacks.</p>

<p><strong>A New Floor for Hubbard Hall </strong></p>
<p>Friends,</p>
<p>We have another great summer matching campaign that will give you a chance to help us make art and community happen far into the future while doubling your gift.</p>
<p>We have recently received $20,000 from a private funder and a few private donors towards the preservation and restoration of Hubbard Hall. As you know, the Hall is a jewel of our community. Volunteers have worked tirelessly for 38 years now to maintain and restore this gorgeous and historic building. It's time we invested further in its restoration, so that future generations will be able to experience this gorgeous space - and so visitors from around the world can see an 1878 opera house still in full operation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align=""center""><strong>Now we are aiming to match this $20,000 with another $20,000 raised from additional donations by the end of September- with the goal to replace the floor in Hubbard Hall by February 2017!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Have you ever noticed how cracked and worn the floor is? Ever wished the actors in our plays could walk while talking, rather than needing to strategically stand still long enough to deliver dialogue before braving the squeaks and creaks we all hear as soon as they move? Have you ever stood downstairs and heard the floor shake under artists' feet as they simply move across the space? Did you know the piano started to crack through the floor last fall, leading us to put across a partial cover on the floor temporarily, just to ensure the piano didn't crash onto the first floor?</p>
<p>                  </p>
<p><strong>Will you help us?</strong></p>
<p>You can give online at Hubbard Hall, call <a rel=""noopener nofollow"" value=""+15186772495"">518-677-2495</a> and give your gift over the phone or walk in during our regular business hours (Tues-Friday 10 am-5 pm). Any gift - $50, $100, $1,000 - will help us toward our ultimate goal of replacing the floor by February. With a new floor in the Hall, artists and audiences will see our community pride first-hand and be able to admire the gorgeous Hall without worry.   Have no doubt - the restoration of the floor is the first on a long list of restoration projects we will pursue over the next few years, including restoring the walls and ceiling and adding better-accessible bathrooms to the building.</p>
<p>On behalf of the entire Hubbard Hall family, and especially the thousands of people, of all ages and interests, who will benefit from our programs in the coming year, thank you again for your incredible support. I am so proud to be the Executive &amp; Artistic Director of this amazing organization. And I can't wait to see you at our next event.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p> </p>

We have recently received $20,000 from a private funder and a few private donors towards the preservation and restoration of Hubbard Hall. As you know, the Hall is a jewel of our community. Volunteers have worked tirelessly for 38 years now to maintain and restore this gorgeous and historic building. It's time we invested further in its restoration, so that future generations will be able to experience this gorgeous space - and so visitors from around the world can see an 1878 opera house still in full operation.
 
Now we are aiming to match this $20,000 with another $20,000 raised from additional donations by the end of September- with the goal to replace the floor in Hubbard Hall by February 2017!
 
Have you ever noticed how cracked and worn the floor is? Ever wished the actors in our plays could walk while talking, rather than needing to strategically stand still long enough to deliver dialogue before braving the squeaks and creaks we all hear as soon as they move? Have you ever stood downstairs and heard the floor shake under artists' feet as they simply move across the space? Did you know the piano started to crack through the floor last fall, leading us to put across a partial cover on the floor temporarily, just to ensure the piano didn't crash onto the first floor?
                  
Will you help us?
You can give online at Hubbard Hall, call 518-677-2495 and give your gift over the phone or walk in during our regular business hours (Tues-Friday 10 am-5 pm). Any gift - $50, $100, $1,000 - will help us toward our ultimate goal of replacing the floor by February. With a new floor in the Hall, artists and audiences will see our community pride first-hand and be able to admire the gorgeous Hall without worry.   Have no doubt - the restoration of the floor is the first on a long list of restoration projects we will pursue over the next few years, including restoring the walls and ceiling and adding better-accessible bathrooms to the building.
On behalf of the entire Hubbard Hall family, and especially the thousands of people, of all ages and interests, who will benefit from our programs in the coming year, thank you again for your incredible support. I am so proud to be the Executive & Artistic Director of this amazing organization. And I can't wait to see you at our next event.
Sincerely,

</p><p>The
P A C’s <i>Landing</i>  – A Collaborative Dance Film</p>
<p><b>WHAT IS  P A C?  </b></p>
<p>The P A C, aka Perkins and
Collaborators is a project-based collective of an emerging choreographer, cinematographer,
writer,  and dancers looking to merge their
skills and intellect in the pursuit of a collaborative artistic experience.
While the concept of integrating multi-disciplinary art forms in performance is
hardly revolutionary, it is a necessity for the creation of newly discovered
and thought-provoking paradigms. With this community of artists we look to
confront new artist possibilities as we stretch beyond what is familiar. We strive
to challenge and grow our understanding of Art and how we present it.  This project expands upon an earlier work, Forward, and is collaborated with new creative
architects in the making of a work entitled Landing.</p>
<p><b>INTRODUCTION </b></p>
<p>My name is
Maxwell Parr Perkins and I am kicking-off a new dance film project to promote
active collaboration between choreographer, cinematographer, writer, and dancers.  I am a NYU – Tisch School of the Arts
graduate and a U.S. 2011 Presidential Scholar in the Arts recipient. </p>
<p>During an Art
History class, I became interested in the historical lineage of American
photography and how it impacts our popular visual culture. While stumbling upon
a painting created by Marcel Duchamp, entitled <i>Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2</i>, I was inspired.  His painting was my visual epiphany for the
creation of my work <i>Forward</i>.  Duchamp’s painting led me to understand space
and how it could be used as a character in my work. </p>
<p>I gathered a
group of talented dancers to develop and present my choreographic piece, <i>Forward</i>.  My
artistic expression of <i>Forward</i>  was enhanced
by the collaboration of music and sound with composer Byron J.
Wu, NYU graduate-Music Theory and Composition. 
Working with Byron allowed me to add dimension to the piece.  The combination of his musical score with the choreography
gave it a new life. While we are both creative people, having an extra set of
senses allowed for new information and ideas to flow. </p>
<p><b>ABOUT  LANDING </b></p>
<p>In the
performance of <i>Forward</i>, the piece
ends with the dancers lined-up and walking to the edge of the stage, exiting
into the audience. <b>This is where Landing
begins<i>. </i></b>The dancers stumble into
the unknown, symbolically free-falling off the stage and into darkness. This
unknown reality is metaphorically what humans are constantly confronted with in
our daily lives.  As we maneuver and
allow the unpredictable randomness of life, it shows us a new sense of balance.</p>
<p>To expand
the many concepts being explored in <i>Landing</i>,
it seemed logical to create a film of this new work so as a viewer you are able to
fully experience the idea of scrambling through the unknown. </p>
<p>In the creative
process, I am excited to be collaborating with Jake Saner, Amber Holloway and
four dancers.   Jake Saner is a NYU graduate and freelance cinematographer
in NYC.  He has invaluable experience
filming dance and a wonderful perceptive eye as a filmmaker.  Amber Holloway, a freelance writer, graduate
from Alabama School of Fine Art, and fellow 2011 U.S. Presidential Scholar in
the Arts recipient, composed a series of poetic verses which act as our
narrator and soundtrack to the piece.  Working
with Amber helped me set the emotional stage with the audio for the world of <i>Landing</i>. 
Her multi-dimensional talents have impacted the overall creative
process.  The four guest dancers – Hannah
Cullen, Kyle Filley, Mariel Harris, and Jacoby Pruitt, all from the NYU Tisch
Dance- class of 2015, bring beautiful expression and movement.</p>
<p>Together these collaborations - a filmmaker, a
writer, talented dancers, me as choreographer and fifth dancer are the creative
team for <i>Landing.</i></p>
<p><b>WHY I NEED YOUR SUPPORT? </b></p>
<p>Creativity is
always restless! This is why I am asking for your support to help fund the
works of these emerging artists.  Filming will take place late May 2015.  </p>
<p>The project
funding request <b>is $2,460.</b> The funds
go towards modest stipends for the collaborator’s time, creativity and hard
work, for venue space rental, costumes, and film-days
expenses.  </p>
<p>The project is a collective group of emerging,
thinking artist in the pursuit of their dreams and goals.  I promise you will be proud of the film and all
of the emerging artist. Your investment will be used wisely.</p>

<div>IKIGAI (roughly translated, “a reason for existing”) is a depiction of untranslatable Japanese words through hyper-physical and explosive movement. The work is a study in how language can become movement and vice-versa. IKIGAI treats dance as a language capable of being spoken and written, while simultaneously introducing audiences to the beauty, mystery, and poetry within the Japanese language and culture. <br/><br/>IKIGAI uses written Kanji characters and the spoken cadences for words found only in the Japanese language to create intricate and interweaving spatial patterns. The performers learn two new ways of communication - through Japanese and through Loft Technique - as they engage with the work culturally and corporeally. <br/><br/>Loft Technique, which IKIGAI is based in, is a unique blend of house dance, capoeira, various street dance styles, and contemporary floorwork. The combination of these styles allows for movement that flows gracefully in and out of the floor, while simultaneously facilitating the attack and defiant attitude inherent within hip-hop dance. </div>
<div>As a work, IKIGAI journeys through the full emotional spectrum - from the frustrations of learning a foreign language to the bliss of falling in love for the first time -  while proposing that each of our “reasons for being” is to fully experience the untranslatable and uncapturable moments in life. </div>

<p><strong>Professor Sanchez was one of professors in the very first autonomous Black Studies Department at San Francisco State College in 1968.  She wrote the play DIRTY HEARTS in 1971, the same year that George Jackson was murdered in prison, and the same year of the Attica prison rebellion.  This play is in obvious conversation to the ways that the economic powers-that-be dominate our society and depend on prison.  America depends on prison like no other naton in the world.  This play shows how these powers have successfully created a world that demands subservience to them. When one ambitious businessman, Carl, tries to play their game of power, he discovers a wall that represents the same well-intentioned confront when trying to fulfill the American dream. Carl represents all of us in the American system who are simply trying to make it, and fulfill the American dream.  Within this play is an important story that teaches the nature of the system in which we live and suggests, for attentive artistic audience members, a whole new approach to it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I need contributors to help us secure a space to tell this important story.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>The funding you provide for this campaign will go straight to our venue, the Adrienne Theater, to secure our performance spaec.  We have unique perks.

Nuclear Love Affair is a spectacular investigation of historic events that follows America as she enters the Atomic age and begins her torrid love affair with violence.  We aim to show – through music, media and live performance – the social and political chain reaction caused by the atomic bomb. Focusing on the period of 1941-1969, we aim to decode our nation’s reverence with the atomic age, examining the figurative shock waves of this war-obsessed era and how they still resonate today.  Nuclear Love Affair is presented by Built for Collapse and premieres at The Tank in early May.  
Built for Collapse is a New York City-based arts organization dedicated to building multi-disciplinary communal celebrations that stimulate the senses.  At times an erotic opera, at times a freakish and violent circus, Built for Collapse has been described as a subversive and “creative new approach to theatre.” Founded in 2008 by Sanaz Ghajarrahimi and Ben Hobbs.
The Tank is a non-profit space for performing arts located west of Times Square on 45th Street.  It facilitates new work by emerging performers, designers, writers, directors and producers.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Ken Salzman, I am president of SanZman Productions and Artistic Director of The Renaissance Theatre Co. I've been involved in theatre for the last 40 yrs. acting and directing and running different theatres.In the last 2 yrs. we have been working on a project of having a new play produced, called “The Curse of the Pharaoh’s Kiss”. Through a series of readings and rewrites which have been very <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">successful</span>, we are ready to proceed to the next step. I am currently seeking investors for this project to be produced at an existing theatre space in South Pasadena, CA. This opportunity will also give us a chance to try out the theatre space, work with the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">community</span> and hopefully, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">continue</span> this success to a future of new and exciting works.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What we need is $12,000 to rent the space, set and costumes. What you get is a chance to support a new work and theatre that is new, invigorating and an approach to make it happen.</p>
<p>There are some perks - a t-shirt, previews, dinner and openning. But the biggest perk is to be a part of a new show and the beginning of the a new theatre project that will make a difference in the small theatre world.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal then we will continue to grow the fund in an account that will be used to see this project happen before the end of the year. What ever we do it will be used for producing new works. Mark my words we will see this project on it's feet.</p>
<p>The new play, by noted playwright, Wade Bradford, is projected for production Aug. 24 to Oct. 7. It is a comedy spoof on the 30’s ‘Mummy’ films. The play, <em>“Curse of the Pharaoh’s Kiss”</em> was written by Mr. Bradford in a ‘<em>Charles Busch</em> style’, with LA and NY award winning male/actress R. Christofer Sands in mind as the ‘<em>femme fatal’ </em>whom we are lucky enough to have involved in this project.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The readings of the play have generated positive comments and hopes that it will be seen soon on stage. But we need the support of you, the theatre lover and theatergoer who is interested in seeing theatre with a new feeling of excitement, supporting new playwrights and new theatre works.</p>
<p>I believe that this dedication exists. I believe that this dedication is out there. It’s about courage, intelligence and the heart of the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">theatre community</span> in the face of these challenges.  And with the help of the excellent team I have put together, we can move small theatre forward. I am completely committed to making the theatre space a creative, groundbreaking and innovative place where actors, directors and technicians can stretch their imaginations. I look forward to working with <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">you</span>. Please take time to give what <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">you</span> can to this theatre project. Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>So what is the Boot Campaign you ask? Well..</strong></p>
<p>The Boot Campaign is a grassroots initiative started by five women 
from Texas known as the Boot Girls. The campaign encourages everyone to 
“get their boots on” providing an easy and tangible way for Americans to
 show appreciation for troops, cultivate awareness of the challenges 
they face upon return and raise funds for military programs meeting the 
physical and emotional needs of our heroes. To do this, The Boot 
Campaign raises money through the sale of boots, t-shirts, and other 
items. In the process, they not only support our national heroes but 
promote patriotism to our great nation! More information about The Boot 
Campaign can be found at <a href=""http://www.BootCampaign.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.BootCampaign.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is Reverie Dance Theatre?</strong></p>

<p>Brave men and women serve our country without question each day and

16,000 of those injuries are catastrophic leaving these military heroes 
with enormous hurdles to overcome when they return home.  The average 
age of an injured soldier is 23.  Almost 8,000 troops have been killed 
in action since 2001.  If the average military family size is 4 people,
 then over 230,000 direct family members are affected by current-day 
military casualties and loss.</p>
<p>Your donation to make this show a success will make a significant 
donation to The Boot Campaign possible. This aid will assist wounded 
military and their families with job placement, mortgage free homes, 
PTSD counseling, adaptive clothing and so much more.</p>
<p>Help us to show our great nations veterans how much we appreciate the selfless job they do!</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:</p>
<p>We could use a lot of help to spread the word about the show, The 
Boot Campaign, and this funding campaign. Reach out to your friends and 
family via email and social media. We'd love to fill the seats on show

unique experience for audiences in the Delaware Valley.  In addition, a 
key goal for Reverie Dance Theatre is to instill in its dancers a desire
 to have a positive influence within their community. www.ReverieDanceTheatre.com

The Impact You Have
Brave men and women serve our country without question each day and 
often come home for their tours of duty facing many difficulties. Did 
you know? Nearly 50,000 US troops have been injured since 2001, over 
16,000 of those injuries are catastrophic leaving these military heroes 
with enormous hurdles to overcome when they return home.  The average 
age of an injured soldier is 23.  Almost 8,000 troops have been killed 
in action since 2001.  If the average military family size is 4 people,
 then over 230,000 direct family members are affected by current-day 
military casualties and loss.
Your donation to make this show a success will make a significant 
donation to The Boot Campaign possible. This aid will assist wounded 
military and their families with job placement, mortgage free homes, 
PTSD counseling, adaptive clothing and so much more.
Help us to show our great nations veterans how much we appreciate the selfless job they do!
Other Ways You Can Help

Boot Campaign, and this funding campaign. Reach out to your friends and 
family via email and social media. We'd love to fill the seats on show 
day and encourage people to ""Get Their Boots On!""",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

fun.   I've been a dancer since I was 6 years old. I started dancing Argentine tango 11 years ago and started teaching beginners at folk festivals in 2007. For me to continue to improve and to better teach people I need ongoing 
intense training with very skilled teachers. Over the last six years I have been lucky enough to be able to indebt myself to go to Buenos Aires to train with good teachers.<br/>In Canberra there is a very strong community movement which supports tango  without so much of a commercial aspect. The tango club, of which I was president for 6 years, has started to provide models for presenting participatory tango activities that are being picked up by other places nation wide.<br/><br/><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>This year, my capacity to  join fellow tangueros travelling to Argentina has been thwarted because  I
 am paying a large sum of money for my son to join a school trip to 
Europe. My choice. However I'm unhappy to be  missing out on this regular professional input. <br/><br/>To join this year's group travelling to Buenos Aires, I need $9000 to cover airfares, accommodation, 
classes and living expenses for about 3-4 weeks for my partner and myself. <p></p>Over the years, I've written a tango guide and am in the process of writing a tango manual.  I am a bookbinder, and my intention is to bind the manual with blank pages as well as my text so as to provide space for your own notes from classes.<br/><br/>The tango guide is a short, simple guide of what to do and how to do it in Buenos Aires to have a great time at milongas and in the city.

fun.   I've been a dancer since I was 6 years old. I started dancing Argentine tango 11 years ago and started teaching beginners at folk festivals in 2007. For me to continue to improve and to better teach people I need ongoing 
intense training with very skilled teachers. Over the last six years I have been lucky enough to be able to indebt myself to go to Buenos Aires to train with good teachers.In Canberra there is a very strong community movement which supports tango  without so much of a commercial aspect. The tango club, of which I was president for 6 years, has started to provide models for presenting participatory tango activities that are being picked up by other places nation wide.What We Need & What You GetThis year, my capacity to  join fellow tangueros travelling to Argentina has been thwarted because  I
 am paying a large sum of money for my son to join a school trip to 
Europe. My choice. However I'm unhappy to be  missing out on this regular professional input. To join this year's group travelling to Buenos Aires, I need $9000 to cover airfares, accommodation, 
classes and living expenses for about 3-4 weeks for my partner and myself. Over the years, I've written a tango guide and am in the process of writing a tango manual.  I am a bookbinder, and my intention is to bind the manual with blank pages as well as my text so as to provide space for your own notes from classes.The tango guide is a short, simple guide of what to do and how to do it in Buenos Aires to have a great time at milongas and in the city. Since I have been several times, it is a working document as I update it after each visit.As the donation amount increases I can only give of myself: either in terms of my own knowledge and lessons and/or a concise manual.

<p>Hi there, </p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read about our fantastic new project.<i> Prayers for the New World </i>is a theatrical exploration of hope and faith when when all seems lost. We're excited to be premiering this new work in Toronto in the fall of 2013, and we could use <i>your </i>help bringing the show to life on stage. </p>
<p>First things first. <b>Who are we? </b>Glasswater Theatre is an ensemble of artists dedicated to theatre that explores the hard questions that life asks. We like to dare ourselves with unconventional spaces, stories and performances so that we can challenge our audiences as well. For more about us, visit us at <a href=""www.glasswater.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.glasswater.ca</a>.</p>
<p>Our next project, <i>Prayers for the New World</i>, is no different. We're performing the show in the round at the Berkeley Street Theatre Rehearsal Hall here in Toronto, working with four brilliant actors as we weave two compelling stories together. Spanning 300 years, the show connects characters through time in a powerful and moving way, using text, music and movement to engage our audience. To accomplish all that we hope with this next production, we need your help to get off the ground.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>We've already covered the cost of the venue, and some of our other start-up expenses. As we move into full production over the next four weeks, we need a bit more support for some of our ambitious goals: </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>The Rehearsal Hall is a beautiful historic building, but is exactly what it's called: a rehearsal hall. We need to bring our own lighting system to the space in order to show off our performers. We have an amazing system of hanging lights planned for the space, but we need help wiring the system. </li>
<li>We also need to provide seating for our audience. Any contributions you put towards the show will help us seat people as comfortably as possible.</li>
<li>We always want to pay our artists. In a world where independent theatre often means working for free, we're trying to break the mold and pay our artists for the work they're doing. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>There's a reason that we don't call theatre-goers customers - you're a patron. You are our patrons. Without your support, we couldn't make this happen. Our entire team is already so grateful that you're considering helping us out.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you have the time, please consider sharing our campaign with others as well. Word of Mouth is the most powerful tool any theatre company could ask for. You can talk about us on Facebook, Twitter, with your mom, your dog (if your dog is rich), or perhaps your friendly neighbourhood theatre critic (tell them that we'll give them free tickets to come review our show). Anything you can do to help us would be much appreciated. You can find all those fancy sharing tools just below the photo above, and visit us on Facebook and Twitter, just below. </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Ann marie Houghtailing and this year I performed my one woman show, <b>Renegade Princess</b> in the Santa Fe Solo Performance Festival, and now I'm headed to New York for my off Broadway debut. I am a single mother, entrepreneur and writer who is finding ways to create a dollar out of thin air, raise good men, take care of my mother, and live my dream. In March of 2011 I went to Santa Fe to write my show and in March 2012 I will be performing at Stage Left Studios in New York. My goal is to take <b>Renegade Princess </b>as far as I possibly can - HBO, are you listening? Fortune favors the bold. This is my bold dream that I'm getting to live out loud.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I believe that story telling is as old as the human experience and it is what inspires us and binds us to one another. The ability to create a collective experience that allows people to laugh, celebrate and contemplate the human condition is important work that deserves a platform. Theater has always been a singular experience where a group of people come together and share a story. With your help I will be able to share my story and you will be able to say that you helped take a show to New York and that will become part of your story.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Not only will I have to pay for travel and expenses for the 2 1/2 weeks that I'm in New York, but I will also have to pay for a Director and Publicist to ensure that my product is in its best and highest form, and that I have the maximum amount of exposure to take my work to the next level. I am also a firm believer in paying people their worth and want to make sure that those who are committed to my success are properly compensated. I will also need to hire a videographer to film my show so that I can use the footage for future promotions and to share with potential influencers. Any financial support is greatly appreciated and please share our campaign with others. The $5000 will cover a large portion of the expenses and I will personally fund anything that exceeds the campaign goal.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I believe deeply in community so I am asking that you use the share tools, spread the word and help me take the <b>Renegade Princess</b> across country. </p>

<p>The Human Animal is a theatre collective which emerged from the University of Warwick in 2012. Our ethos as theatre-makers seeks to put the human being and consciousness at the centre, emphasising artistic collaboration as we produce, direct, devise and perform our own work as an ensemble. </p>
<p>Our previous projects have harnessed various creative forms. In our inaugural two productions, <i>Lovely Rita</i> and <i>Women War Lustgames</i> (Act I), we interrogated the post-war human and nature of repeated human error. By exploring the lyrical texts of Thomas Brasch, we challenged how a German playwright’s work can be made relevant and engaging for an English-speaking audience. In our next project we delved into the world of online connection as a space for making theatre in <i>Virtual Tourist</i>. Entirely internet-based, the piece served as a commentary highlighting how modern technology has devalued face-to-face communication.</p>
<p>With a continued fascination with technology as a driving force in how we form human connections today, we are pursuing work that is  immersive and in promenade to interrogate perceptions of nature against virtual connection in our developing production of <i>Wastwater</i>.</p>

We will be performing at C nova from July 30th to August 16th.</span><br/></p>
<p><i>'The people here feel so lonely that they need a television to remind them that there's a world outside'. </i></p>
<p>A mother and son. A pair of lovers. A supplier and her client. On the edges of Heathrow Airport, six lives threaten to blow apart. Upon closer inspection, these seemingly conventional relationships will tilt our understanding of human interaction in a world pervaded by technology. Written by one of the UK's leading playwrights, Simon Stephens' <i>Wastwater</i> is an episodic portrait of the individual on the brink of monumental change. In this promenade production, The Human Animal invite you to explore, touch and trace the world of <i>Wastwater</i>, guiding you through airport security in promise of a flight that will never take off.</p>
<p>The concept of <i>Wastwater</i> emerged through witnessing recent theatre work involving promenade, immersive and site-specific work. From our experiences as audience members of immersive theatre, we value it as a visceral and reflexive form to get individuals to engage with the society they live in and the world around them. Crucially for us, Stephens’ play throws up many ideas for commentary with relevance to the state of society today and how we can find genuine communication in a digital age. We are hoping our production will successfully bridge the gap between contested issues around technology and surveillance, and how these issues are manifested in the audience’s own lives.</p>
<p>The piece will be created by the ensemble, where pairs perform a scene and also direct one of the others together. We believe that by having fluid role distinctions, there is increased artistic ownership over the project from each member of the company and similarly a more cohesive way of working as an ensemble.</p>

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Why do we need funding?</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>The Edinburgh Fringe is an invaluable platform for breaking through to the professional world, however it is very expensive to put on a show at the festival.</p>
<p>As a new student theatre company, we rely 100% on outside funding and bursaries in order to produce our own work. Without this support, we would be unable to take <i>Wastwater</i> to Edinburgh and we would miss out on an opportunity to gain exposure and get our work seen by a wider audience outside of Warwick.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>How will we use your funds?</h3>
<br/><p>Everything that we raise will go straight back into funding the production, specifically financing the costs for production design and set transportation costs.</p>
<p><i>Wastwater</i> uses a promenade structure, where the audience will move across three rooms, each housing it's own distinct environment. Once the audience has watched one of Stephens' scenes they will be led through an interactive transitional space; each one representing a different stage of air travel (check-in, security and duty free). Once the audience passes through all three rooms they will then be led back through to find they have been transformed to be completely new spaces.<br/><br/>All the spaces will encourage a high level of interactivity for audiences. The three written scenes take place in very distinct environments: a greenhouse, a hotel room and finally an abandoned warehouse. We want each of these to be suggested through details which play with the notion of authenticity.

</div></div>","Who are we?


The Human Animal is a theatre collective which emerged from the University of Warwick in 2012. Our ethos as theatre-makers seeks to put the human being and consciousness at the centre, emphasising artistic collaboration as we produce, direct, devise and perform our own work as an ensemble. 
Our previous projects have harnessed various creative forms. In our inaugural two productions, Lovely Rita and Women War Lustgames (Act I), we interrogated the post-war human and nature of repeated human error. By exploring the lyrical texts of Thomas Brasch, we challenged how a German playwright’s work can be made relevant and engaging for an English-speaking audience. In our next project we delved into the world of online connection as a space for making theatre in Virtual Tourist. Entirely internet-based, the piece served as a commentary highlighting how modern technology has devalued face-to-face communication.
With a continued fascination with technology as a driving force in how we form human connections today, we are pursuing work that is  immersive and in promenade to interrogate perceptions of nature against virtual connection in our developing production of Wastwater.

What is Wastwater?

The Human Animal is taking a production of Wastwater by contemporary British playwright Simon Stephens at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe 2014. We will be performing at C nova from July 30th to August 16th.
'The people here feel so lonely that they need a television to remind them that there's a world outside'. 
A mother and son. A pair of lovers. A supplier and her client. On the edges of Heathrow Airport, six lives threaten to blow apart. Upon closer inspection, these seemingly conventional relationships will tilt our understanding of human interaction in a world pervaded by technology. Written by one of the UK's leading playwrights, Simon Stephens' Wastwater is an episodic portrait of the individual on the brink of monumental change. In this promenade production, The Human Animal invite you to explore, touch and trace the world of Wastwater, guiding you through airport security in promise of a flight that will never take off.
The concept of Wastwater emerged through witnessing recent theatre work involving promenade, immersive and site-specific work. From our experiences as audience members of immersive theatre, we value it as a visceral and reflexive form to get individuals to engage with the society they live in and the world around them. Crucially for us, Stephens’ play throws up many ideas for commentary with relevance to the state of society today and how we can find genuine communication in a digital age. We are hoping our production will successfully bridge the gap between contested issues around technology and surveillance, and how these issues are manifested in the audience’s own lives.
The piece will be created by the ensemble, where pairs perform a scene and also direct one of the others together. We believe that by having fluid role distinctions, there is increased artistic ownership over the project from each member of the company and similarly a more cohesive way of working as an ensemble.

Why do we need funding?

The Edinburgh Fringe is an invaluable platform for breaking through to the professional world, however it is very expensive to put on a show at the festival.
As a new student theatre company, we rely 100% on outside funding and bursaries in order to produce our own work. Without this support, we would be unable to take Wastwater to Edinburgh and we would miss out on an opportunity to gain exposure and get our work seen by a wider audience outside of Warwick.


How will we use your funds?
Everything that we raise will go straight back into funding the production, specifically financing the costs for production design and set transportation costs.
Wastwater uses a promenade structure, where the audience will move across three rooms, each housing it's own distinct environment. Once the audience has watched one of Stephens' scenes they will be led through an interactive transitional space; each one representing a different stage of air travel (check-in, security and duty free). Once the audience passes through all three rooms they will then be led back through to find they have been transformed to be completely new spaces.All the spaces will encourage a high level of interactivity for audiences. The three written scenes take place in very distinct environments: a greenhouse, a hotel room and finally an abandoned warehouse. We want each of these to be suggested through details which play with the notion of authenticity. Rather than being realistic spaces, they are often facilitated by technology and represented through artificial means.

Risks and Challenges

There are a multitude of challenges which any fledgling theatre company faces when mounting a production. But at the Fringe these can be significantly magnified. Last Summer alone Ed Fringe saw just under 3,000 shows taken up and this year promises to be the biggest Fringe ever. We are confident Wastwater has a number of unique qualities that will stand out amongst others, but we need your help too! These are just a few of the challenges and risks your money could help us avoid.
-	The Human Animal as a theatre collective has been set up entirely off our own back. As a group of young people still in full-time education, we lack any real capital to create the financial foundation of a show like Wastwater and ensure it reaches the level of desired quality.
-	One of Wastwater’s biggest selling points is our in-depth, immersive set design. Ranging from dozens of intricate pieces like letters, clothing and plants, to tech equipment - importantly a projection system. The ‘immersive’ quality is vital to our interpretation of the piece, but will be very costly.
-	Transporting the set will also be a major challenge. Our company is primarily based in the Midlands thus getting all our resources and materials to the Fringe (and then back again) will cost a large amount.


Thanks so much for visiting this page. Anything you can give us will be a huge help ensuring Wastwater is a huge success and allowing our company to continue producing exciting work.

Chicago's newest dance company needs your partnership to produce our first performance! 
Founded on October 13th 2011, Chicago Repertory Ballet brings together seasoned dancers, choreographers and designers into a collaborative process to produce concert dance, to the stage.

We believe that the artistic voices of today have much to say, and it is our mission to bring you dance from a new generation in both the abstract and the story format.
YOU CAN BRING THE ARTISTIC VOICE OF THIS GENERATION TO LIFE!

discover a play richly drawn on the search for meaning that encompasses our lives.  This is a play about visual artists living in the East End of London,

<p>I am an actor and host of the Offstage Podcast, from Toronto Canada. I was inspired to create the podcast by the Downstage Center podcast that was hosted for many years by Howard Sherman. I loved the podcast, but Canadian voices were few and far between. I wanted to create something similar with a focus on Canadian theatre, and thus the Offstage Podcast was born.</p>
<p>Because I live in Toronto, most of the people I have interviewed have been from Toronto, but I’ve always intended the podcast to be about Canadian theatre, and while it is possible to interview people via skype, nothing replaces a face to face conversation.</p>
<p>To that end, I’m going to Montreal in June for the Montreal Fringe Festival, and I’m going to interview people involved in the Festival, from Festival staff, to actors and directors and playwrights involved with the Festival, and even a few of the volunteers.</p>
<p>Going to Montreal will increase the diversity of voices that I've been able to interview, and will extend the reach of the podcast allowing me to tell more stories in Canadian theatre.</p>
<p>Every cent raised will go towards this trip.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need $500 to cover accomodation, travel and food while in Montreal. The closer I get to the goal, the longer I can stay in Montreal and the more people I can interview. Even if I don't reach the goal, I will still be going to Montreal and recording as many podcasts as possible, I will only be able to go for a day or two, which means I won't be able to interiview as many people as I want.</p>

<h3>Dear Friends,</h3>
<p><strong>I have been invited to premiere a brand-new 25 minute dance on the Inside/Out Stage at the 80th Anniversary Season of Jacob's Pillow. This is an honor both thrilling and humbling.</strong></p>
<p>Jacob’s Pillow is the oldest internationally acclaimed summer dance festival belonging to the United States. In 2003, its organization was recognized as a National Historic Landmark and remains the only such site in the field of contemporary dance. In 2010, President Barak Obama presented Jacob’s Pillow the distinction of being the first dance institution of its kind to receive the prestigious National Medal of Arts.</p>
<p>Dubbed “the dance center of the nation” by <em>The New York Times</em>, Jacob’s Pillow draws nearly 80,000 visitors to its magical habitat in the Massachusetts Berkshires annually. Its foundation maintains a clear and effectual mission to foster “dance creation, presentation, education, and preservation; and to engage and deepen public appreciation and support for dance.” <strong>My participation in the 2012 Inside/Out series and the public feedback discussion conjoined with our performance offers my dance theater ensemble the opportunity to exchange with a diverse and unfamiliar audience and community. Furtheremore, I create dance to connect.</strong> I believe in the power of disclosure; the moment of vulnerability when the stage bares all and the audience can put themselves on the inside. Moreover, my art transpires from the personal. It is the collective “I” panting, soaring and stumbling hard before you, as you sit and watch my performance transcend from the street to the stage.</p>
<h3><strong>The funds raised by this campaign will directly facilitate the specific creation and production of my most recent work, entitled <em>Learning to forget and other tragic fortunes</em>.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Key expenses include:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Necessary travel and accommodation for our 3-day excursion taking us from the hubbub of New York City to the Berkshire mountains of Western Massachusetts.</li>
<li>Security for essential rehearsal time and space rentals.</li>
<li>Original scoring and live accompaniment by musical composer Jason Anastasoff.</li>
<li>Innovative costume design by Liz Ionescu.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, last but certainly not least:</p>
<p>Paid compensation to the six professional dancers that will be bringing this new work to life: dancers Courtney Baron, Andrea Jane Dispenziere, James Morrow ChristinaNoel Reaves, Prentice Whitlow and myself included as choreographer and performer. <strong>This is the most crucial cause for our campaign. I believe that it is a critically important to reimburse the professional artists not only for their on-stage performance, but also for the time, talent and sweat already dedicated to the in-studio process.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2>THE GOAL: $6,000.00</h2>
<h3>Budget Breakdown:</h3>
<p>Artist Wages: $3,000.00</p>
<p>Rehearsal Space Rentals: $1,550.00</p>
<p>Original Music Composition: $500.00</p>
<p>Original Costume Design: $250.00</p>
<p>Travel &amp; Accomodation Expenses: $700.00</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>THE WORK:</h2>
<p><strong><em>Learning</em><em> to forget and other tragic fortunes</em></strong> is a confession of memory and its opposing states; presence versus absence, repetition versus rendition, duration versus distortion, endurance versus exhaustion. We move to find answers, or perhaps even to make love, to our confusion. Our bodies tugs on the emotions that curdle and coil up on the inside and stamp vibrant patches onto musings past, staring back blankly and consuming us whole.</p>
<p>My creative process is immersive. I dive headfirst into inspiration, cushioning my fall with literature, conversations and exhibitions of other art mediums, artists and theorists that link up with my incentive. I talk about it, I read about it, I ask more questions, I take responsibility for it... I bathe in it. I spend the first 1 – 3 weeks in the studio alone where I contemplate, research and furiously generate movement material and contextual situations. I improvise with my eyes locked shut and guided by my gut. The result is a soft, faceted athleticism tinged by my technical training background and fueled by emotions aroused here and now. I create my dances for the bodies, personalities and histories of those individuals cast. We work intimately, maintaining a fluid dialogue throughout the process of design and construction. Revelation, doubt, wonder, love, hate flies around the studio and binds the dance together. My collaboration is an exchange of trust.</p>

<h3> </h3></div>","Dear Friends,
I have been invited to premiere a brand-new 25 minute dance on the Inside/Out Stage at the 80th Anniversary Season of Jacob's Pillow. This is an honor both thrilling and humbling.
Jacob’s Pillow is the oldest internationally acclaimed summer dance festival belonging to the United States. In 2003, its organization was recognized as a National Historic Landmark and remains the only such site in the field of contemporary dance. In 2010, President Barak Obama presented Jacob’s Pillow the distinction of being the first dance institution of its kind to receive the prestigious National Medal of Arts.
Dubbed “the dance center of the nation” by The New York Times, Jacob’s Pillow draws nearly 80,000 visitors to its magical habitat in the Massachusetts Berkshires annually. Its foundation maintains a clear and effectual mission to foster “dance creation, presentation, education, and preservation; and to engage and deepen public appreciation and support for dance.” My participation in the 2012 Inside/Out series and the public feedback discussion conjoined with our performance offers my dance theater ensemble the opportunity to exchange with a diverse and unfamiliar audience and community. Furtheremore, I create dance to connect. I believe in the power of disclosure; the moment of vulnerability when the stage bares all and the audience can put themselves on the inside. Moreover, my art transpires from the personal. It is the collective “I” panting, soaring and stumbling hard before you, as you sit and watch my performance transcend from the street to the stage.
The funds raised by this campaign will directly facilitate the specific creation and production of my most recent work, entitled Learning to forget and other tragic fortunes.
Key expenses include:

Necessary travel and accommodation for our 3-day excursion taking us from the hubbub of New York City to the Berkshire mountains of Western Massachusetts.
Security for essential rehearsal time and space rentals.
Original scoring and live accompaniment by musical composer Jason Anastasoff.
Innovative costume design by Liz Ionescu.

And, last but certainly not least:
Paid compensation to the six professional dancers that will be bringing this new work to life: dancers Courtney Baron, Andrea Jane Dispenziere, James Morrow ChristinaNoel Reaves, Prentice Whitlow and myself included as choreographer and performer. This is the most crucial cause for our campaign. I believe that it is a critically important to reimburse the professional artists not only for their on-stage performance, but also for the time, talent and sweat already dedicated to the in-studio process.
 
THE GOAL: $6,000.00
Budget Breakdown:
Artist Wages: $3,000.00
Rehearsal Space Rentals: $1,550.00
Original Music Composition: $500.00
Original Costume Design: $250.00
Travel & Accomodation Expenses: $700.00
 
THE WORK:
Learning to forget and other tragic fortunes is a confession of memory and its opposing states; presence versus absence, repetition versus rendition, duration versus distortion, endurance versus exhaustion. We move to find answers, or perhaps even to make love, to our confusion. Our bodies tugs on the emotions that curdle and coil up on the inside and stamp vibrant patches onto musings past, staring back blankly and consuming us whole.
My creative process is immersive. I dive headfirst into inspiration, cushioning my fall with literature, conversations and exhibitions of other art mediums, artists and theorists that link up with my incentive. I talk about it, I read about it, I ask more questions, I take responsibility for it... I bathe in it. I spend the first 1 – 3 weeks in the studio alone where I contemplate, research and furiously generate movement material and contextual situations. I improvise with my eyes locked shut and guided by my gut. The result is a soft, faceted athleticism tinged by my technical training background and fueled by emotions aroused here and now. I create my dances for the bodies, personalities and histories of those individuals cast. We work intimately, maintaining a fluid dialogue throughout the process of design and construction. Revelation, doubt, wonder, love, hate flies around the studio and binds the dance together. My collaboration is an exchange of trust.
 
Our performance at the 2012 Jacob’s Pillow Dance Festival is scheduled for August 1. We need your help. Your investment in this process —however, big or small— will help sustain and further support the manifestation of our artistic mission and the cooperation of its several contributing artists.
Thank you for your time and your generosity in browsing our fundraising campaign!

<h2>Short Summary - <a href=""http://carteblanche-sf.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://carteblanche-sf.com</a>
</h2>
<p>My name is Charline Formenty, and I'm the artistic director of the San Francisco-based dance/theater company <strong>Carte Blanche</strong>. I moved from France to California three years ago in the hopes of creating a dance company. When I met the dancer Marie Plouviez, another recent immigrant from France, that dream came true. Together we founded Carte Blanche and created our first show, <em><strong>Ophelia</strong> </em>(for more about the show, please visit our website at <a href=""http://carteblanche-sf.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://carteblanche-sf.com</a>). <em>Ophelia</em> played at NOHspace in San Francisco for 3 sold out nights and received multiple awards from Bay Area Dance Watch.<br/><br/>Now, <strong>Fort Mason Center</strong>, one of San Francisco biggest cultural centers, is giving us a grant to produce a site-specific version of our show. This is an incredible opportunity for our company. We’ve taken <em>Ophelia</em> beyond the stage to the grounds of Fort Mason. The show will be an <strong>walk-through experience</strong>, combining video interaction, dance and theater. Ophelia will bring the audience on a journey through 5 different locations on the campus, both indoors and outdoors, creating a <strong>fully immersive experience</strong> for the viewer.<br/><br/>Besides being our first show, <em>Ophelia</em> is a project very dear to my heart. It is the story of my immigration to the United States and my journey as a woman in search of her identity. Creating this show with Marie Plouviez (who had also just moved to the country when we started the project) was an intensely personal experience. Yet I believe this show will make sense to anyone as an exploration of the self, dreams, and memories. Ophelia could be any of us.<br/><br/>Performing <em>Ophelia</em> at Fort Mason Center is not only a dream realized, but a huge boost for Carte Blanche. It will give us much more visibility and help us take the show on tour, all while bringing a great show to the community.</p>

<h2><strong><strong><span>What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></strong></strong></h2>
<p><strong><strong><br/></strong></strong>This dream can only come true with a complete <strong>budget</strong>. To make this project happen, we will need a total of $23,000. Fort Mason Center is giving us a $6,500 grant and we’ll make some money with ticket sales, but unfortunately that won’t be enough.<strong> We’re missing roughly $8,000</strong>.<strong><strong><br/></strong></strong><br/>Without your help, we won’t have enough funding to perform.<br/><br class=""kix-line-break""/><strong>With your help we will</strong>: <br/><br/></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>- Pay the dancers and the technicians for their hard work<br/></span>- Build the set and create the costumes<br/>- Add a cutting-edge interactive video performance on a 150 ft long wall, featuring original 3D animations designed specifically for the show<br/>- Create wonderful interactive virtual 3D animation<br/>- Rent the audio/visual equipment<br/>- Produce a great marketing campaign<br/>- Pay for the necessary insurance and taxes</p>
<p><br/>To <strong>express our gratitude</strong> for your help, we have a bunch of great perks ready for you! For only $25, you can become a part of our set, and we have custom-made limited edition cards, posters and T-shirts for all levels of donors (as well as a number of other great rewards).<br class=""kix-line-break""/><br class=""kix-line-break""/>If we don’t reach our entire goal, we will have to make some major cuts in the show. We won’t be able to afford a full crew, which would have a huge impact on the overall artistic value of the project. The whole project could potentially be in jeopardy. Without reaching our minimum budget, everything that makes this show so unique might be lost.</p>
<h2><strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.6266983870882541""><br/><span>The Impact</span></strong></h2>
<p>The performing arts exist because they’re a vital part of the well-being of any community. They have always been a conduit for change, progress, and evolution, and are fundamental expressions of our freedom of speech. My goal with Ophelia is to elevate the way people experience life, and have some impact on the way we all look at the world. With this show, I want to share my unique perspective as a modern day immigrant with the community. My medium is dance, and my tools are dream imagery and poetry, laughter and sorrow, and conflict and harmony.<br/><br/>I’ve already put together a stellar crew for this project. All of us working on Ophelia are passionate artists who believe in this piece and want to achieve the highest possible artistic value. We all are heavily involved in the performing arts, and have enough experience to take on a project of this magnitude. We couldn’t be more excited to have this opportunity.<br/><br/>The history of Fort Mason Center, the talent of the cast and crew, and the foggy backdrop of San Francisco will all combine to create a new kind of immersive theatrical experience.<strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.6266983870882541""><strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.8536498355679214""><span> I would love for each one of you to be a part of it.</span></strong></strong></p>

J’ai fondé la compagnie en collaboration avec Marie Plouviez que j’ai rencontré dans les rues de San Francisco. Oui oui, juste en face de la maison bleue!! Ensemble nous avons créé <em>Ophelia</em> et réunit une équipe de professionnels autour de notre projet. <br/>Nous avons eu l’occasion de montrer notre travail au NOHspace pour 3 représentations et nous avons eu la surprise et grande joie de faire salle comble les 3 soirs!  Quelques mois plus tard, nous avons recus deux awards  et l’opportunité de jouer au Garage puis à Portland dans l’Oregon. Enfin, Fort Mason Center nous a offert une subvention pour créer une version de notre spectacle adaptée à leur lieu. <br/><br/>Fort Mason Center est un des plus gros centres culturels de la ville de San Francisco, c’est donc une enorme opportunité qui s’offre à nous. <br/><br/>Le spectacle sera itinérant et nous emmerons le public pour une belle ballade à travers le Fort. Ca sera également l’occasion de mettre en valeur le patrimoine incroyable de cette ancienne base militaire. <br class=""kix-line-break""/>Pour ce faire,  nous allons créer une version du spectacle avec de la danse, du théâtre et l’usage des nouvelles technologies avec de la video interactive!    <br/><br/><em>Ophelia</em> est un projet qui nous tient particulièrement à coeur à Marie et moi-même car c’est une pièce qui raconte notre immigration aux Etats-Unis et la quête identitaire que ce type d’aventure force en nous. C’est un spectacle qui nous parle à tous, immigrants ou non car il parle d’identité, de rêves, et de mémoires. Ophelia c’est peut-être vous...<br/><br/>Jouer <em>Ophelia</em> à Fort Mason Center, ce n’est pas seulement un rêve, c’est aussi un pas énorme pour la compagnie Carte Blanche et nos carrières aux Etats-Unis.<strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.6266983870882541""><br/><br/></strong></p>

Fort Mason Center nous donne une subvention de $6,500 [5 000€] et nous comptons récupérer de l'argent grace à la vente des tickets. Il nous manque donc $8,000 [6 000€] pour réaliser notre projet.<br/><br/>Et sans votre aide, nous n’y arriverons pas. Grace à vous nous pourrons: </p>

Grâce au rêve et à la poésie, au rire et aux larmes, les arts de la scène existeront toujours car ils apportent aux gens de nouvelles perspectives et des rêves.<br/><br/>L’équipe que nous avons réunit pour ce projet est solide. C’est une équipe composée de gens passionnés par notre projet, qui ont vraiment envie de faire quelque chose avec nous sur le long-terme. Nous sommes tous très enthousiastes à l’idée de travailler sur ce spectacle qui va être si unique et différent de ce que l’on trouve sur la scène San Franciscaine. <br/><br/>Jouer Ophelia à Fort Mason Center sera une experience unique, qui apportera beaucoup à nos carrières respectives et j’aimerai que vous en fassiez parti, même de loin! <br/><br/>Merci,<strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.6266983870882541""><br/></strong></p>

We’re missing roughly $8,000.Without your help, we won’t have enough funding to perform.With your help we will: 
- Pay the dancers and the technicians for their hard work- Build the set and create the costumes- Add a cutting-edge interactive video performance on a 150 ft long wall, featuring original 3D animations designed specifically for the show- Create wonderful interactive virtual 3D animation- Rent the audio/visual equipment- Produce a great marketing campaign- Pay for the necessary insurance and taxes
To express our gratitude for your help, we have a bunch of great perks ready for you! For only $25, you can become a part of our set, and we have custom-made limited edition cards, posters and T-shirts for all levels of donors (as well as a number of other great rewards).If we don’t reach our entire goal, we will have to make some major cuts in the show. We won’t be able to afford a full crew, which would have a huge impact on the overall artistic value of the project. The whole project could potentially be in jeopardy. Without reaching our minimum budget, everything that makes this show so unique might be lost.
The Impact
The performing arts exist because they’re a vital part of the well-being of any community. They have always been a conduit for change, progress, and evolution, and are fundamental expressions of our freedom of speech. My goal with Ophelia is to elevate the way people experience life, and have some impact on the way we all look at the world. With this show, I want to share my unique perspective as a modern day immigrant with the community. My medium is dance, and my tools are dream imagery and poetry, laughter and sorrow, and conflict and harmony.I’ve already put together a stellar crew for this project. All of us working on Ophelia are passionate artists who believe in this piece and want to achieve the highest possible artistic value. We all are heavily involved in the performing arts, and have enough experience to take on a project of this magnitude. We couldn’t be more excited to have this opportunity.The history of Fort Mason Center, the talent of the cast and crew, and the foggy backdrop of San Francisco will all combine to create a new kind of immersive theatrical experience. I would love for each one of you to be a part of it.
 
Other ways you can help
No amount is too small - even $10 will help us reach our goal.  We understand that not everyone can help financially, but you can also help us by telling others about the show. Share this campaign, share our website, and share our facebook page! While donations are essential, spreading the word is just as important. Pass it along!With Love,Charline Formenty
 
 
 


EN FRANCAIS S’IL VOUS PLAIT!! 

Bonjour à tous, Je m’appelle Charline Formenty, et je suis la directrice artistique de la compagnie Carte Blanche basée à San Francisco. J’ai fondé la compagnie en collaboration avec Marie Plouviez que j’ai rencontré dans les rues de San Francisco. Oui oui, juste en face de la maison bleue!! Ensemble nous avons créé Ophelia et réunit une équipe de professionnels autour de notre projet. Nous avons eu l’occasion de montrer notre travail au NOHspace pour 3 représentations et nous avons eu la surprise et grande joie de faire salle comble les 3 soirs!  Quelques mois plus tard, nous avons recus deux awards  et l’opportunité de jouer au Garage puis à Portland dans l’Oregon. Enfin, Fort Mason Center nous a offert une subvention pour créer une version de notre spectacle adaptée à leur lieu. Fort Mason Center est un des plus gros centres culturels de la ville de San Francisco, c’est donc une enorme opportunité qui s’offre à nous. Le spectacle sera itinérant et nous emmerons le public pour une belle ballade à travers le Fort. Ca sera également l’occasion de mettre en valeur le patrimoine incroyable de cette ancienne base militaire. Pour ce faire,  nous allons créer une version du spectacle avec de la danse, du théâtre et l’usage des nouvelles technologies avec de la video interactive!    Ophelia est un projet qui nous tient particulièrement à coeur à Marie et moi-même car c’est une pièce qui raconte notre immigration aux Etats-Unis et la quête identitaire que ce type d’aventure force en nous. C’est un spectacle qui nous parle à tous, immigrants ou non car il parle d’identité, de rêves, et de mémoires. Ophelia c’est peut-être vous...Jouer Ophelia à Fort Mason Center, ce n’est pas seulement un rêve, c’est aussi un pas énorme pour la compagnie Carte Blanche et nos carrières aux Etats-Unis.
Ce dont nous avons besoin et ce que vous obtenez
Mais pour réaliser ce rêve, nous avons besoin de votre aide! Car ce rêve ne se réalisera pas sans avoir un budget cohérant. Pour jouer Ophelia à Fort Mason Center, nous avons besoin de $23,000 [17 500€]. Fort Mason Center nous donne une subvention de $6,500 [5 000€] et nous comptons récupérer de l'argent grace à la vente des tickets. Il nous manque donc $8,000 [6 000€] pour réaliser notre projet.Et sans votre aide, nous n’y arriverons pas. Grace à vous nous pourrons: 
- Créer les animations 3D interactives- Payer les danseurs et les techniciens pour leur travail- Construire le décor et créer les costumes- Développer la technologie nécéssaire pour les scènes d’interaction video - Louer l’équipement son et lumière- Avoir une bonne campagne publicitaire- Payer pour les assurances et autres taxes
  Pour vous exprimer notre gratitude pour votre générosité, nous avons prévu quelques cadeaux que nous pourrons votre envoyer à travers l’Atlantique! Koya Takahashi et moi-même allons créer des cartes, posters et t-shirts en édition limité qui seront signés par toute l’équipe avec des petites notes personnalisées bien sûr!En plus, nous vous proposons aussi d’être là, avec Ophelia, sur scène. Et oui! Le décor d’Ophelia étant fait des lettres qu’elle recoit, qu’elle envoit, qu’elle imagine... nous aurons une lettre qui vous est adressée quelque part dans le décor! Si nous n’atteignons pas notre but financier, nous ne pourrons malheureusement pas produire le spectacle tel que nous l’aons prévu. Il nous faudra couper plusieurs scènes du spectacle, et ça nous mettra en difficulté pour payer notre équipe et nous-même. De plus, la valeur artistique du spectacle en prendra un sacré coup! Ce qui fait que ce projet est si unique et différent tombera à l’eau.
L’impact
Les arts du spectacle ont toujours existé à travers toutes les civilisations pour la bonne raison qu'elles sont nécessaires au bien-être de la communauté et qu'ils ont été un excellent moyen de faire évoluer notre société. Il est important pour moi de réaliser ce projet parce que je veux partager mon point de vue avec vous et le plus de personnes possible. Pas pour devenir célèbre, pas pour devenir riche, mais pour sensibiliser les gens autour de moi à une perspective différente et avoir un impact sur la façon dont nous regardons le monde. Grâce au rêve et à la poésie, au rire et aux larmes, les arts de la scène existeront toujours car ils apportent aux gens de nouvelles perspectives et des rêves.L’équipe que nous avons réunit pour ce projet est solide. C’est une équipe composée de gens passionnés par notre projet, qui ont vraiment envie de faire quelque chose avec nous sur le long-terme. Nous sommes tous très enthousiastes à l’idée de travailler sur ce spectacle qui va être si unique et différent de ce que l’on trouve sur la scène San Franciscaine. Jouer Ophelia à Fort Mason Center sera une experience unique, qui apportera beaucoup à nos carrières respectives et j’aimerai que vous en fassiez parti, même de loin! Merci,
