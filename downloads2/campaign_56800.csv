<p><strong>The AutoBrush for Kids Genesis</strong></p>
<p>The idea for AutoBrush Kids happened when I took my two-year-old to the doctor and he asked if I was brushing her teeth yet.  ""Of course, twice a day every day. We love brushing our teeth, don't we sweet pea."" I responded looking for the gold star mom award.  </p>
<p><br/>In reality, the closest I had gotten to brushing my daughters’ teeth was buying her a toothbrush so she could put it in her mouth to be like me.  Trust me, all she did was put it in her mouth. The brushing going on was zero. In fact, she stopped even putting it in her mouth about two seconds after she discovered daddy had an electric toothbrush she could use.  By use, I mean that she would steal it and hide it somewhere around the house so daddy could have a panic attack looking for it every morning.</p>
<p><br/>So, I went home feeling like I mom-failed big time with the full intention of brushing my little ladies teeth regularly without fail.  I even stopped at the store and got her some special kids strawberry toothpaste. When it came time to start brushing, the moment my mom-game was going to be strong again, my daughter started screaming in hysterics.  She wasn't going to help me out with my perfect mom mission.</p>
<p><br/>At this point, being a human who couldn't accomplish a simple task, I started questioning whether or not kids ACTUALLY need to brush their teeth that well or regularly.  I mean, their baby teeth will fall out eventually anyway right? What's the big deal? This is just the ""man"" trying to get me to buy more stuff! To calm myself down and prove myself right, I went to the internet to do some research.  This is a mistake I have made before. What I actually found out was that having my little one brush her teeth is incredibly important!</p>

<p><strong>Compared to kids with poor oral health, children who establish good oral hygiene habits at a young age:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Are less likely to get sick</li>
<li>Are more likely to continue excellent brushing and flossing as adults, experiencing far fewer dental problems throughout life</li>
<li>Maintain a positive self-image</li>

<li>Have a better relationship with food</li>
</ul> <p>That's when the idea of the <a href=""https://www.autobrush.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">AutoBrush</a> transpired.  If kids tooth brushing is so important, how can we as parents get them excited about brushing their teeth?  I was on a rally to find a way to get my daughter to start creating a positive relationship with dental hygiene to carry her through the rest of her life.</p>
<p><br/>Thanks to the innovative team at <a href=""https://www.autobrush.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">AutoBrush</a>, I am now equipped with a solution!  <strong>The first children's innovation in dental care in decades; AutoBrush for Kids is not only fun for my daughter but it cleans every surface of her teeth</strong> which was impossible to accomplish with a normal or even electric toothbrush.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1547224854/jcjrv0tubiikkwqfifbz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What do dentists say about automatic dental care for kids?</strong></p>
<p>They endorse it wholeheartedly!  There are a few things they recommend you consider when planning proper dental care for your children that the AutoBrush for Kids innovation took into account.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Kids can be frightened by an electric toothbrush. </strong>They buzz; they make noise; they can tickle or feel weird on gums and teeth. Kids have more sensitive gag reflexes than adults that are designed to protect their smaller airways from obstruction. As a result, anything that goes into a child’s mouth is likely to be more uncomfortable than for an adult. AutoBrush for Kids allows your child to get a clean mouth in less than 15 seconds and it also plays a pleasant song that makes the routine fun instead of scary.</li>
<li>
<strong>Kids look to their parents for guidance. </strong>Show your child what you do, and he will want to mimic it. Even before a parent sticks a toothbrush in a kid’s mouth, that child should see his mom or dad exhibiting good brushing habits, especially if the parent decides to introduce an electric toothbrush. As parents and role models we are not likely going around the house flossing, brushing, and smiling. For this reason, we recommend introducing an <u><a href=""https://www.autobrush.com/collections/all/products/autobrush"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">adult AutoBrush</a></u> into your routine when you first give the <u><a href=""https://www.autobrush.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">AutoBrush</a></u> to your child.  Make it look like fun, and kids will want to be part of it. Since it is hands-free maybe you could play some patty cake while it is running!</li>
<li>
<strong>Some children breathe primarily through their mouth</strong>, rather than their noses. These kids may be less likely to enjoy brushing, as it can be hard to breathe and brush at the same time, and they may gag more easily.  The AutoBrush for Kids was designed not to obstruct breathing and to allow easy airflow to your child's lungs.</li>
<li>
<strong>Kids won’t need toothpaste until they are at least 5 years old</strong>—before then, toothpaste can complicate everything. Kids may not like the taste of toothpaste; it may turn them off from the overall brushing experience, and the truth is that kids are more likely to brush for a longer time if they are doing so with a “dry” brush. AutoBrush for Kids is just as effective with or without toothpaste and the toothpaste we offer is a light flavor that is not too intense for children.</li>
<li>
<strong>Children don’t understand the importance of brushing</strong>, and they cannot visualize the whole area inside their mouth, let alone try to reach all of it. Kids also lack the coordination of proper brushing, so AutoBrush for Kids can help them reach more areas of their mouth with less effort.</li>
<li>
<strong>A child can start an automatic dental routine as early as age 2</strong>—without toothpaste.  The key is making sure the first experience with dental hygiene is fun, which is why we offer fun animal friend options to help comfort your child when they first start brushing. Music is also incorporated so your child can dance through their session!</li>
<li>
<strong>Most children are ready for an automatic dental routine when they ask for it</strong>—when she sees a parent using one and asks for her own, for example. Turning brushing into a family activity can certainly facilitate this process with is why we have the <u><a href=""https://www.autobrush.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">AutoBrush</a> </u>available for <u><a href=""https://www.autobrush.com/collections/all/products/autobrush"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">premier adult dental care</a></u> as well.</li>
<li>
<strong>Typically, parents are usually willing to buy a higher quality toothbrush for themselves than for their children</strong>, but that is the wrong approach. You want the same quality of toothbrush for your child that you have for yourself, primarily because lower quality toothbrushes may lead to an abrasive toothbrush head that can damage the enamel on a child’s still-developing teeth.</li>
</ol>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1547224890/nep1w5sllkoiq9g1quae.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Make sure your child’s brush is fully charged before enjoying! Place battery capsule on charging pad. Insert one end of USB cable to charging pad and the other to a USB power source to let charge completely. Light indicator will turn off once fully charged. Full charges last for 30 days.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Attach 1 brush head to an animal friend. Run our yummy, bubble gum flavored Foaming Toothpaste along top and bottom of brush head from one end to the other.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Have your child insert the brush head into their mouth and bite down so silicone bristles wrap around all teeth, top and bottom, inside and out.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Firmly press button on front face of battery capsule to start the fun! Your animal friend will play a lively safari tune and automatically vibrate to brush all teeth and gums simultaneously. Let sit and dance along for at least 30 seconds. Can press button again for multiple modes.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Holding down power button to shut off, have your child remove brush head from their mouth, spit, and rinse as usual once done. Build up easily rinses off antibacterial, silicone brush head with little water. Place items back on charging pad for next jamming session!</p>

<div><strong>Why is AutoBrush for Kids better at than any other kids toothbrush?</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>1. Plaque removal:</strong> The key job of any toothbrush is to remove <a href=""https://www.autobrush.com/blogs/dental/what-the-plaque"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>plaque</u></a> from teeth and gums, and the high-quality kids AutoBrush will remove <a href=""https://www.autobrush.com/blogs/dental/what-the-plaque"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>plaque</u></a> consistently and from all areas of the mouth. </p>
<p>Removing <a href=""https://www.autobrush.com/blogs/dental/what-the-plaque"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>plaque</u></a> is especially important in the prevention of cavity formation. Americans, especially those eating a Western diet filled with refined carbohydrates, have thick plaque layers which sit on top of the “biofilm,” which is the protective layer referred to as “the skin of our teeth.” The biofilm is what nourishes the tooth, keeping it moist and supplied with calcium. With too much plaque on top of the biofilm, the tooth struggles to access the nutrients it needs, thus leading to cavities and decay.</p>
<p><strong>2. Head shape and size: </strong>Head shape and size are important in accessing hard-to-reach areas, such as between the cheeks and molars. This is extremely important for kids, whose mouths are small and still developing.  With AutoBrush for Kids’ complete mouth tray, we make sure no tooth surface goes untouched!<br/> <br/><strong>3. Quality of bristles: </strong>With the high-quality tooth and gum massagers on AutoBrush for Kids, you only need to replace the head every three months.  With lower quality bristles found on most kids electric or standard toothbrushes, the process may need to occur more frequently. Bristles make contact with the tooth, and a bristle made of cheaper material will wear down quickly and become too sharp, scratching the enamel!</p>
<p><strong>4. Power source: </strong>A quality kids’ electric toothbrush should be rechargeable, not battery powered. The battery-powered toothbrushes that can be purchased at the supermarket are not high quality, and there is no need to worry about the charging bases of electric toothbrushes, as they are completely safe for kids to be around.</p>

</h3><p>With 5 speed levels, the Evo Pro handheld massager meets different groups' needs and is suitable for most kinds of situations for muscle and fascia relaxation.</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Muscle Activation</strong>: Start with 1st gear before exercise, 2200rpm helps you warm up and protects your muscle efficiently.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fascia Relaxation</strong>: 2nd gear provides 2400rpm, and is suitable for elderly and office staff who often feel muscle and fascia tension.</li>
<li>
<strong>Lactic Acid Decomposition</strong>: After strenuous exercise, your body generates Lactic Acid in the muscle and it takes time for the body to break it down naturally. 3rd gear 2600rpm percussion accelerates this process and eliminates the soreness.</li>
<li>
<strong>Deep Massage</strong>: 4th gear with its 2800rpm allows for a deeper percussive massage gun to really promote recovery.</li>
<li>
<strong>Athlete Mode</strong>: 5th gear's 3200rpm high-intensity percussions blast away any remaining aches and pains and prepare you for competition.</li>

I have been a personal trainer for over 20 years. My vision for the <strong>PUSH UP MACHINE</strong> coalesced several years ago when I took my hand drawn sketches to a local product development company. Those drawings evolved into an initial prototype and, after several years of further development, the first official prototype (pictured above).</p><p>In the 2010s, social media and crowdfunding did not exist as we know it today.

Not hitting our funding goal only affects our rate of growth and future manufacturing.Never Give Up!My name is Matt Shade. I have been a personal trainer for over 20 years. My vision for the PUSH UP MACHINE coalesced several years ago when I took my hand drawn sketches to a local product development company. Those drawings evolved into an initial prototype and, after several years of further development, the first official prototype (pictured above).In the 2010s, social media and crowdfunding did not exist as we know it today. I only had a pending patent and I had no interest in selling the idea, so I shelved the PUSH UP MACHINE. Fast forward to 2017 and things started to happen. I received notice that the patent was allowed, I applied and received an SBA Loan and Indiegogo helped me create a launch pad for the initial go-to-market strategy.The SBA Loan and Indiegogo platform will help fund our tooling and manufacture of the first 2000 PUSH UP MACHINE'S.

<h3>A Message From the Founder</h3>
<p>Why do we slouch? Its no secret, but most people don’t know. I’m here to tell you. You slouch because your foundational muscles are too weak to hold your body erect. Your body is like a high rise building with a bowling ball on top. Without strong structural support the building collapses. Check yourself, are you in a continuous state of collapse? I was. I had to address the real problem. Weakness. I needed to design something that could make me stronger at work gaining valuable hours everyday. I started to look into different ways of strength building, weight training, yoga, elastic resistance, pilates. Powerful methods of transformation. Could I make a tool that was a combination of them all? Yes! My eureka moment, I called it Wearable Strength.</p>

A Message From the Founder
Why do we slouch? Its no secret, but most people don’t know. I’m here to tell you. You slouch because your foundational muscles are too weak to hold your body erect. Your body is like a high rise building with a bowling ball on top. Without strong structural support the building collapses. Check yourself, are you in a continuous state of collapse? I was. I had to address the real problem. Weakness. I needed to design something that could make me stronger at work gaining valuable hours everyday. I started to look into different ways of strength building, weight training, yoga, elastic resistance, pilates. Powerful methods of transformation. Could I make a tool that was a combination of them all? Yes! My eureka moment, I called it Wearable Strength.",30.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>We have been working on the Freq Reflex for many years; since coming up with the idea we have developed, improved and perfected it. We have already completed a production run in the UK selling 170 kits to coaches, athletes and physiotherapists. The results and feedback from our first customers were amazing and it even won the best innovation award at the Elite Sports Performance Exhibition. We have since redeveloped the product and improved our manufacturing process and are now in a position to bring the product to the mass market. The £10,000 we need will help pay for production.</p>

<h2>Prepare for Competition - Test Data</h2>
<p>A total of 5 athletes between the ages of 18-25 years were tested. All subject have an athletic background, specialising in either 200m, 400m sprint running, Sprint Hurdles, Long Jump and Triple Jump. They had a training history of 5 to 10 years and train between 3 and 6 days a week. </p>
<p>The athletes were split into two groups. One group of 3 were tested in a 30m sprint test and a reactive jump test (group 1). The other group of 2 were tested in a 30m sprint test and a counter-movement jump test (group 2). All jump tests were conducted in a controlled indoor environment using an electronic jump matt and sprint tests were recorded using electronic timing gates. </p>
<p>The jump and sprint tests were conducted before using the Freq Reflex for a baseline measurement.  The second test was conducted with the Freq Reflex and the final test was conducted after using the Freq Reflex. Each athlete had at least 10 minutes rest between each test.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>

<p>Early research indicates that the biggest short-term impact seems to be on 2 distinct levels:</p>
<p>1: A potentiation effect after using the Freq Reflex</p>
<p>2: Improved neurological control and biomechanics as the athletes consistently referred to the ""toe up"" position almost taking care of itself with the product. </p>
<p>Use the Freq Reflex 10-20 minutes before competition to get similar effects and get the last minute performance edge against your competitors.   </p>

</div></div>","Our Story
We have been working on the Freq Reflex for many years; since coming up with the idea we have developed, improved and perfected it. We have already completed a production run in the UK selling 170 kits to coaches, athletes and physiotherapists. The results and feedback from our first customers were amazing and it even won the best innovation award at the Elite Sports Performance Exhibition. We have since redeveloped the product and improved our manufacturing process and are now in a position to bring the product to the mass market. The £10,000 we need will help pay for production.

Using the Freq Reflex for the first time


 

Product Features

 
Resistance Bands

Each set (colour) of resistance bands comes with a pair of small, medium and large (6 bands) 
to suit your size and needs. 
 
Prepare for Competition

Our research has shown that using the Freq Reflex 10-20 minutes before you compete can improve your short term performance by as much as 60% 
 
Improve Technique and Power

Use the different resistance bands to assist with foot position and improve your power at the same time! Train the force-velocity curve to develop true power and peak for competition while ingraining perfect technique. 
Running Efficiency for Speed and Endurance 

The Freq Reflex optimises foot position by pulling the foot up, improving ground contact time, stride rate and overall running efficiency. 
Prevent Injury

By improving your running efficiency, the Freq Reflex will help your foot land underneath your centre of mass, reducing the stress placed upon the hamstrings and shins to prevent hamstring pulls and shin splints. 
Tendon Stretch Reflexes and Elasticity

Activate and improve your tendon stretch reflexes to put an extra spring in your step. 
Peak Muscle Power

Use all of the different resistance bands at different times during your training and season to improve your muscle power and rate of force development. 
Injury Rehab

Use the Freq Reflex to do the rehabilitation exercises prescribed by your physiotherapist and improve the range of motion of your ankle, getting you back to what you do best sooner. 


 

 
Prepare for Competition - Test Data
A total of 5 athletes between the ages of 18-25 years were tested. All subject have an athletic background, specialising in either 200m, 400m sprint running, Sprint Hurdles, Long Jump and Triple Jump. They had a training history of 5 to 10 years and train between 3 and 6 days a week. 
The athletes were split into two groups. One group of 3 were tested in a 30m sprint test and a reactive jump test (group 1). The other group of 2 were tested in a 30m sprint test and a counter-movement jump test (group 2). All jump tests were conducted in a controlled indoor environment using an electronic jump matt and sprint tests were recorded using electronic timing gates. 
The jump and sprint tests were conducted before using the Freq Reflex for a baseline measurement.  The second test was conducted with the Freq Reflex and the final test was conducted after using the Freq Reflex. Each athlete had at least 10 minutes rest between each test.
Results

Early research indicates that the biggest short-term impact seems to be on 2 distinct levels:
1: A potentiation effect after using the Freq Reflex
2: Improved neurological control and biomechanics as the athletes consistently referred to the ""toe up"" position almost taking care of itself with the product. 
Use the Freq Reflex 10-20 minutes before competition to get similar effects and get the last minute performance edge against your competitors.

The WalkingPad S1 minimizes the noise pollution to average sound scale 45.0dB, and the power engine embedded increases the durability while reducing noise. Engaging in physical fitness activities can be challenging during a global pandemic, but finding a way to adapt to these new conditions is vital to maintaining our health. Now, you can stay active with the WalkingPad S1 and easily store it under your bed or against your wall to set a personalized gym at your home.WalkingPad S1 allows you to be productive and burn calories at the same time. Most people sit in an office environment for hours and don't have the time for their daily exercise. Whether you are working from home or making conference calls, you can still stay in shape, maintain your health, and everything in between. You can now catch up on your favorite tv show, listen to your latest playlist, or facetime with your friends and keep up with your healthy lifestyle all at once. Stay entertained at home with the WalkingPad S1.The WalkingPad S1’s structure was carefully designed with a safety system to ensure your safety while working out. The S1 will automatically stop if no movements were detected on the running belt, and the pre-set speed limit intends to avoid any injury due to operational errors, perfect for senior citizens. Also, the anti-slip mat is made out of EVA material, and it has less friction coefficient when exercising.The WalkingPad S1 can be controlled in three different ways. Under the manual mode, it can be managed by using the remote control or the KS Fit App. Alternatively, it can be controlled by walking, and the Feet Sensory Speed Control Technology will adjust your speed automatically by monitoring the pace of your movement in real-time.WalkingPad S1 can be operated after connecting to the KS Fit App, which also allows you to personalize your training plan, manage your workout data and share your progress such as the amount of steps, calories burned, new speed record, and time achievements with friends and family.





The LED touch panel on the front of the WalkingPad S1 provides you a clear summary of your workout speed and data. You can adjust the brightness by using the remote control. Displayed on the LED panel, you can monitor the speed, the time, the step, and the amount of calories burned by the Feet Sensory Technology. Also, the LED panel is touchable and you can choose two different modes from M to A. M stands for mode and A stands for automatic.

If you don't see a combo that you like, simply purchase a base unit and add accessories in our post campaign pledge manager.You will not be asked for an address. In 14 days we'll send you an email from our fulfillment manager called ""Backerkit"". We will use that tool to collect your shipping details plus you'll be able to add extra accessories that aren't available in the existing perk packages. As part of our partnership with Rich Froning we're producing a limited edition base station with black accents coupled with our complete package. The package also features a free month of his own MayhemNation.com. The package is available now in limited quantities.  At around 6x6x6"" (16x16x16cm) and weighing around 7lbs (3kg), whipr is conveniently sized to fit in any home gym, studio apartment or workout space. Get a full sized workout, pack it down in seconds and store it next to your sneakers.Whipr is also great for travel as it packs easily in your carry on bag (along with accessories) and is permitted to fly on airplanes... we've done it many times.    Whipr started out as a way to replicate stand up paddling. We've expanded on the original concept and now have accessories available to support:
Stand up paddling
Cross country skiing
Rowing
Dragon Boat padding
Canoeing
Kayaking (requires two base stations)
Swimming (requires two base stations)
  Each modality uses the same whipr base unit and is enabled by the use of accessories. You may purchase the whole package or choose just the accessories you need to match your training and exercise needs. Whipr will accept any handles, straps or bars commonly used on a regular gym cable machine (carabiner attachments).Switching modalities is as simple as swapping whipr's orientation and accessories. This takes takes around 15 seconds so it's easy to set up HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) sets using all three modalities.  Whipr can be used with any cable machine attachments, like these velcro leg cuffs.   The whipr base unit is essentially a miniaturized rowing machine with multiple modalities (exercises). It replaces the big, bulk rowing machines and ski-ergs that you'd usually only find in a gym, in fact to purchase equivalent quality machines for all three modalities would cost you over $4,000 and fill up a small bedroom. Whipr will cost you around 10% of that amount and it's around half the size of a basketball.    Key Specifications

Under a door (up to 0.75"" gap) using the inflatable anchor. This works for both vertical (skiing) and horizontal (everything else) base unit orientations.
To a vertical or horizontal post, tree or sturdy piece of furniture up to 18"" in diameter using the webbing anchor.
Into firm ground using the ground anchor.
  The onboard computer provides real-time performance feedback, logging & tracking including:

 The whipr app is available for iOS and Android devices & is compatible with popular apps like Strava.Connectivity & AppWhipr supports Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to broadcast measurements like Speed, Pace and Power (among others). Our programming uses FTMP/FTMS (FiTness Machine Profile/Service), the Bluetooth standard for fitness equipment. This open protocol makes it very easy for third parties to integrate whipr in their own fitness app. Whipr will also have its own app that provides a real time dashboard and a log book.Our Bluetooth & health teamTo integrate bluetooth we're working with the team from Splendo. Splendo is a Dutch company with a focus on IoT, AI and Digital Health. They've built technology and apps for many high end companies and are an official Garmin Partner. Whipr will be integrated into the SplendoFit platform with app access for all backers. Additionally, our medical advisor Jeroen Molinger (Lead Clinical Medical Exercise Physiologist at Duke University Hospital, Center for PeriOperative organ protection), will be testing the feasibility and validity of whipr as an intervention tool in the rehabilitation and perioperative space. Our backers will receive the benefit of this in terms of better app data and we're thrilled that whipr will be able to help out a lot of people in their rehabilitation and recovery.   The rowing accessory gives the feeling and action of a full sized rower while being extremely compact. When you're finished training, the rower folds down in around 60-90 seconds and can be easily stored. The longest component is 27.5"" so the rails will easily fit in a full sized suitcase. Assembly takes under three minutes and we're very pleased with how solid it feels despite being a portable and lightweight rower. ADJUSTABILITYThe seat can be locked into position in up to 30 different length increments. The locking pin is stored in the seat roller and can be deployed very easily. This will be very useful for anyone wanting to lock the seat in place for kayak, canoe and dragon boat modalities as well as adaptive sports athletes. Locking the seat in place. The locking pin is stored in the seat, ready for use at any timeFOOT POSITIONThe feet are also very adjustable. Each foot cup has 4 angle positions to choose from and are locked in place with a retractable inbuilt pin. Leaving the pin out also allows for a 'free' mode where the foot cups will freely swing in the center of the foot. We prefer the second hole from the bottom for rowing.The height of your foot on the foot plate is adjusted with a velcro strap that cups the heel. The top of seat to lowest heel position is 18cm, equivalent to a number 4 foot plate setting on a Concept 2 (third from the top). Adjustment of the foot cup into 1 of 4 locked positions or free rotate.ROWER ASSISTED PADDLINGWith the seat locked in place the whipr rower becomes an incredible platform for rower assisted paddle modalities. I've had many questions about if the rower could be used for canoeing and dragon boating and the short answer is yes. In the video I'm using our SUP paddle on the shortest setting and there is plenty of clearance for all modes. It's even useful as a SUP trainer for when you don't have an anchor available, or just want to integrate some standing paddling into your training.

   Our stand up paddle shaft has been developed in collaboration with Black Project SUP, manufacturers of world championship winning paddles and fins. The paddle shaft collapses into 2 pieces (one of which houses the adjustable shaft length) and is length adjustable to suit any height. The pieces are each 17.5"" long and will easily fit inside a carry on bag (typical carry on bag height is 22-24"").The paddle shaft is a special blend of carbon fiber that is softer then normal paddles to give it a distinctive 'alive' feeling in your hands. We've spent a lot of time playing with the right compounds to get it just right and the action is endorsed by world championship paddlers. To attach the paddle shaft simply clip the carabiner onto the whipr base unit. Our paddle shaft, perfectly sized for travel and for paddlers large and small.Train outdoors by anchoring to almost any fixed object. Great for bootcamps!  The cross country skiing accessory functions similarly to ski-ergs you'll find in high-end and cross fit gyms. Resistance is engaged with both arms (isolated single arm resistance would require two whipr base units). We've built this accessory to be compact and travel easily while retaining full fluid motion.    To use the ski attachment simply unfold it, hook it over a door frame, attach the pulley to the whipr base unit hook and start skiing. The cord length is adjustable with a convenient system built into the handles and when you're finished it folds down to just 10""x4"" for easy storage and travel.   The Swim & Surf accessory consists of two hand paddles that attach to two base units. They are designed to reproduce the motion of swimming and surfing (paddling). The swim accessory is only available in our post campaign manager, Backerkit.The backer exclusive price is $12, or the swim accessory is free with the purchase of a second base station.Suggested swim/surf setup Note: the bench is not included. The dual base unit (kayak) accessory is only availablein our post campaign manager Backerkit. The backer exclusive price is $85.Using two base stations and our dual base station attachment you can convert the rower into a kayak ERG. You will need the following items:
Two base units
The rowing accessory
The dual base station accessory (available as an add-on in our fulfillment manager)
(Optional) Kayak paddle
Our kayak paddle is also available separately for $85. It is length adjustable by 7"" and packs down for portability Many campaigns have disappointed their backers by not thinking through their shipping and logistics strategy.

<h3><strong>UPDATE: We are now planning to do four or five basic ""how to"" videos, where Nancy ""Miss Mermaid"" Kummen will show how to train a child basic water safety and get them started swimming, using the <i>Miss Mermaid Swim Trainer</i> as part of the product, if the goal is met!</strong></h3>
<h2><strong><u>The MISS MERMAID Swim Trainer</u></strong></h2>
<p>""If I could just find a way to make these and put them up for sale...""<br/>""Nancy... do you know what I do for a living?</p>
<p>That was the beginning of the conversation after my daughter's swim lesson with Nancy - aka ""<i>Miss Mermaid"".</i></p>
<p>I already knew Nancy was passionate about teaching kids to be safe around water - it only takes 10 minutes of her talking animatedly to you about the subject to get that.</p>
<p>But the little ""noodle boat"" she'd made in her garage (using rough tools and occasionally hurting herself) was in constant use to that one goal - GETTING KIDS SAFE AROUND WATER.</p>
<p><u><strong>Facts:</strong></u></p>
<ul>
<li>In the US alone, <u>every year</u>, nearly <u><strong>800</strong> children are lost to drowning</u>.</li>
<li>
<u>Many more</u> are <u>permanently injured</u> due to near drowning.</li>
<li>These are largely <u><i>preventable</i> tragedies</u>.</li>
<li>The <u>Miss Mermaid Swim Trainer</u> is a<u> valuable tool</u> to help <strong><u>get kids water safe, faster</u>.</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We've worked together for two years to observe, test, check and re-design features, and ensure that the <i>Miss Mermaid Swim Trainer</i> is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Affordable </strong>- by using <u><strong>ONE main component</strong></u>, and a <u><strong>user-provided</strong></u> standard Pool Noodle, we were able to reduce the cost of each unit by over 50%. <i>Note that this does mean the Foam Noodle must be purchased separately</i> - please see the FAQ for more information on why we made this important decision.</li>
<li>
<strong>Easy to use</strong> - It takes less than two minutes to unpack, and assemble with your 2.75 to 3 inch (standard) Foam Pool Noodle.</li>
<li>
<strong>Versatile </strong>- It can be used for everyone from a child who cannot swim at all, to a training athlete, to an adult in need of post-injury or surgery aquatherapy.</li>
<li>
<strong>Durable </strong>- We evaluated a half dozen manufacturing techniques and materials (with some spectacularly messy and often hysterical failures in the prototype phase) to arrive at the right one. Versatile, long-lasting, high-performance, recyclable. In addition, the <strong>Packaging</strong> is designed as a mesh bag - to be re-used as a carrying and drying bag for the Miss Mermaid Swim Trainer, and other small swim accessories (goggles, etc.) - along with a plastic tag with space for the Student or Athlete's name. So <u>ZERO packaging into the landfill!</u>
</li>
<li>
<u><strong>LEGAL NOTE: The <i>Miss Mermaid™ Swim Trainer</i> is a training device intended to help children and adults learn to float and swim, thus making them safer in and around water. It is NOT intended or designed as a life saving device.</strong></u><br/> </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Here's who we are:</h3>
<p><strong>Nancy</strong> - the<strong> primary inventor</strong> of the <i>Miss Mermaid Swim Trainer</i> - started triathlons with the <strong>1981 Nautilus Triathlon in Hawaii</strong> - an event which was eventually renamed the <strong><i>Ironman®</i></strong></p>
<p>In the <strong>over 40 years since then</strong>, she has competed in<strong> 8 full <i>Ironman® </i></strong>competitions, <strong>400 half-<i>Ironman®s, </i>Duathlons, Biathlons, and 38 marathons</strong>.</p>
<p>In 1991, Nancy made the<strong> USA Team</strong>, and received the <strong>World Silver Medal in Triathlon</strong> for her age group.</p>
<p>In 1992, she was awarded the <strong>Speedo Award for Fastest Master Swimmer</strong>.</p>
<p>She then competed in the <strong>Senior Olympic</strong>s, <strong>Master swim events</strong>, for both Lake and Ocean, and <strong>still competes in triathlons and biathlons to this day</strong>.</p>
<p>Since 1982, Nancy <strong>translated her athletic prowess</strong> into a career as a <strong>trainer</strong>, focusing on <strong>teaching children to swim</strong>, from <strong>beginner water safety and swim training</strong> to youth <strong>competitive training</strong>, and <strong>aquatherapy </strong>for adults and seniors, in private, semiprivate, and group settings. She has also taught lifeguarding, having received her American Red Cross WSI Instructor's License in Lifeguarding, CPR and First Aid in 1981.</p>
<p>She has worked as an <strong>Aquatics Director</strong>, <strong>Head Swim Coach</strong>, <strong>Aqua Aerobics Director</strong>, and has started several <strong>swimming </strong>and <strong>triathlon </strong>coaching <strong>businesses</strong>, including <i>Miss Mermaid's Swim Training</i>.</p>
<p>Nancy's <strong>certifications </strong>include:</p>
<ul>
<li>USA Certified <strong>Triathlon Coach</strong>
</li>
<li><strong>American Red Cross Water Safety Instructor</strong></li>
<li><strong>Lifeguard</strong></li>
<li><strong>CPR</strong></li>
<li>Red Cross First Aid and AED</li>
<li><strong>National Fitness Association Personal and Group Trainer</strong></li>
<li>National Sports Council Medicine</li>

<h3>A Note on the Production of this Campaign</h3>
<p>As you may have noticed, this campaign is ""rough"" compared to many others - we get that, and it's by design.</p>
<p>It was filmed using very cheap knockoff sports cameras for underwater shots (cameras literally duct taped to pool poles), cell phone cameras, etc., and edited together using very inexpensive desktop software (namely Pinnacle) by... us. The copy was written and edited by... us.</p>

<p>We're as ""grass roots"" as you can get.</p>
</div></div>","UPDATE: We are now planning to do four or five basic ""how to"" videos, where Nancy ""Miss Mermaid"" Kummen will show how to train a child basic water safety and get them started swimming, using the Miss Mermaid Swim Trainer as part of the product, if the goal is met!
The MISS MERMAID Swim Trainer
""If I could just find a way to make these and put them up for sale...""""Nancy... do you know what I do for a living?
That was the beginning of the conversation after my daughter's swim lesson with Nancy - aka ""Miss Mermaid"".
I already knew Nancy was passionate about teaching kids to be safe around water - it only takes 10 minutes of her talking animatedly to you about the subject to get that.
But the little ""noodle boat"" she'd made in her garage (using rough tools and occasionally hurting herself) was in constant use to that one goal - GETTING KIDS SAFE AROUND WATER.
Facts:

In the US alone, every year, nearly 800 children are lost to drowning.

Many more are permanently injured due to near drowning.
These are largely preventable tragedies.
The Miss Mermaid Swim Trainer is a valuable tool to help get kids water safe, faster.


We've worked together for two years to observe, test, check and re-design features, and ensure that the Miss Mermaid Swim Trainer is:


Affordable - by using ONE main component, and a user-provided standard Pool Noodle, we were able to reduce the cost of each unit by over 50%. Note that this does mean the Foam Noodle must be purchased separately - please see the FAQ for more information on why we made this important decision.

Easy to use - It takes less than two minutes to unpack, and assemble with your 2.75 to 3 inch (standard) Foam Pool Noodle.

Versatile - It can be used for everyone from a child who cannot swim at all, to a training athlete, to an adult in need of post-injury or surgery aquatherapy.

Durable - We evaluated a half dozen manufacturing techniques and materials (with some spectacularly messy and often hysterical failures in the prototype phase) to arrive at the right one. Versatile, long-lasting, high-performance, recyclable. In addition, the Packaging is designed as a mesh bag - to be re-used as a carrying and drying bag for the Miss Mermaid Swim Trainer, and other small swim accessories (goggles, etc.) - along with a plastic tag with space for the Student or Athlete's name. So ZERO packaging into the landfill!


LEGAL NOTE: The Miss Mermaid™ Swim Trainer is a training device intended to help children and adults learn to float and swim, thus making them safer in and around water. It is NOT intended or designed as a life saving device. 


Here's who we are:
Nancy - the primary inventor of the Miss Mermaid Swim Trainer - started triathlons with the 1981 Nautilus Triathlon in Hawaii - an event which was eventually renamed the Ironman®
In the over 40 years since then, she has competed in 8 full Ironman® competitions, 400 half-Ironman®s, Duathlons, Biathlons, and 38 marathons.
In 1991, Nancy made the USA Team, and received the World Silver Medal in Triathlon for her age group.
In 1992, she was awarded the Speedo Award for Fastest Master Swimmer.
She then competed in the Senior Olympics, Master swim events, for both Lake and Ocean, and still competes in triathlons and biathlons to this day.
Since 1982, Nancy translated her athletic prowess into a career as a trainer, focusing on teaching children to swim, from beginner water safety and swim training to youth competitive training, and aquatherapy for adults and seniors, in private, semiprivate, and group settings. She has also taught lifeguarding, having received her American Red Cross WSI Instructor's License in Lifeguarding, CPR and First Aid in 1981.
She has worked as an Aquatics Director, Head Swim Coach, Aqua Aerobics Director, and has started several swimming and triathlon coaching businesses, including Miss Mermaid's Swim Training.
Nancy's certifications include:

USA Certified Triathlon Coach

American Red Cross Water Safety Instructor
Lifeguard
CPR
Red Cross First Aid and AED
National Fitness Association Personal and Group Trainer
National Sports Council Medicine
Silver Sneakers Certification Land Aerobic Exercise
USA Triathlon Swim Coaching

I'm Thomas - the Product Developer part of the team.I have over 25 years experience in product engineering, manufacturing, and development, including 15 years in designing and developing product in the Pool, Spa, and Recreational Water industry. In addition, during college I worked as a Certified Pool Operator in a hotel chain setting.
I'm now a Product Development Consultant, and have contacts and investments in manufacturing industry all over the world. I create products and lead teams to do anything, anywhere. ""Dreams Made Solid; Dreams Made Real"" is my company slogan (thanks Peter Gabriel!)I am also an active member of the PDMA (Product Development and Management Association), have been a member of the Arizona PDMA Board of Directors, and a PDMA consultant to international client companies.
As such, I have a unique and excellent background to know how much and how long it will take to get this project into the World and doing the good it can do - this is a point where many startups fall apart. I am realistic, from the often painful lessons of experience.
-------------
Dani is the boots on the ground person when it comes to Manufacturing, Sourcing, and Quality Control. With 10 years experience working in the extremely fast paced manufacturing center of the world, Shenzhen, she is uniquely qualified to take a product through manufacturing, quality control, and finally shipping and logistics to get it where it needs to go. With the current situation in the world, our team is now more than ever extremely lucky to have someone of her unique talent, experience, personal virtue, and drive for a quality product.
If it can be done, Dani can find where it should be done, and make sure it gets done correctly, and as on-time as is possible.
Here's where we are (and what we need to get to the goal):
Here are our Timeline Goals:

Design (Done)
Alpha/Beta Testing (Done)
Provisional Patent Application (Done)
Quoting of everything from tooling to logistics (Done)
Warehouse Space (Secured)
Tooling - Six to Eight Weeks
First Article/Production Validation Testing - Two Weeks
Changes (if necessary) - Two Weeks
Initial Production of 5000 to 10,000 units - Four Weeks
Pre-Ship Inspection/Shipping - One Week
Shipping of 100 Early Top Tier Backer Perk Products - December 15, 2021

Shipping (using current ocean shipping, which happens to be a worldwide mess!) - Eight Weeks (Goal of mid-January 2022)
US Warehousing and Fulfillment (already in place)
Shipping of Backer product and Perks: Late March, 2022
Marketing - Eight weeks of campaigns, mid-April of 2022, presentation to Swim Schools and Specialty Retailers in Q4 2021
Launch Date: Spring 2022, with On Shelf/End Customer Ship Date goal of April 18, 2022

The end result of this effort and analysis is a dollar figure which serves as the fuel to fund this project to completion:$92,850
Stretch Goals:At $100,000, we will create an ""XL"" size version of the Miss Mermaid™ Swim Trainer, designed for more intense workouts and training for adult trainees and athletes, and physical therapy/recovery/exercise for larger Adults, AND we will hire a professional videographer with underwater experience to make INSTRUCTIONAL videos showing the use of the Miss Mermaid™ Swim Trainer for aerobic exercise, and suggestions for physical therapists in the use of the device for their patients in aquatherapy.

How is this... ""Making the World a Better Place?""
Quite simply, this product, put to proper use, is designed to help save lives.
Preventing drowning deaths and injuries starts with the children themselves - helping them learn to be safe IN and AROUND water is of utmost importance. When barriers, fences, locks, and alarms fail, knowing how to FLOAT and SWIM are the difference between a funny or frightening story... and the worst tragedy imaginable.
Secondly, providing a better way for Adults to recover from accidents and surgery by using aquatherapy. The Miss Mermaid™ Swim Trainer serves as an ideal stabilizer in water, helping the customer focus on strengthening and healing, rather than stability or any fear of water.

What are the risks?
As with any Product Development project, there are hurdles, and risks. This one in particular is relatively ""safe,"" but still has risks which must be addressed.

The current plan is to manufacture in China (US and other options were evaluated, and found to be ranging from slightly to insanely more expensive than China). If additional tariffs, sanctions, etc. should happen involving the US and China, there are options in Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam to which production could be transferred in order to preserve manufacturing capability.
The chosen factory (which has been in business making products for the US and world markets since 1995) could go out of business. In this case, there are three secondary choices which could receive and use the same tooling to continue manufacturing.
The timeline could be ""blown"". These products are seasonal - people typically only buy in Spring and Summer months, so sales is typically very bad for products which hit the market after, say, mid-June. The Miss Mermaid™ Swim Trainer may be slightly less susceptible due to indoor swim schools and the increase in number of heated pools. But, in this case, Backers would still get the Products and Perks they deserve, and the unsold stock would be stored in the warehouse (we do have warehouse space to fit the entire projected first two years of production) until the next season.

More details to follow.</div><div><br/></div><h2><b>What is ipoura?</b></h2><p>A platform to reestablish the human connection, that has been lost as a result of our global economy, by using pre-existing data systems combined with social media. With ipoura you will be able to use a mobile or web app to connect with the people who made your goods. Companies that use ipoura will provide information (i.e. photos, what they do, short bios, etc) about each person who contributed to the production of your individual product. If you wish, you can share your new purchase with your friends on social media or say thanks to the people behind your product.</p><h2><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">How did the idea come about?</b></h2><p>The idea for ipoura was born out of the Rana Plaza factory collapse, this was an entirely preventable tragedy that is repeated in every country when it industrializes. The realization set in that if a company documented the production process and connected the final consumers to the people producing their individual purchases, you could treat employees humanely and still compete in the market place. Research uncovered that “Enterprise Resource Planning” tools, already in place in all but the simplest of today’s factories, generate all of the necessary information and the only part missing is the programming to connect the people. Instead of building a single factory to change an industry we can build a platform and have an impact upon the entire global economy.</p><h2><b>Why is the human connection so important?</b></h2><p>The loss of the human connection is the reason that financial values seem entirely disconnected from your values. For example: you wouldn’t condone slavery; yet you might unknowingly buy a product that was produced by workers who are enduring near slave labor conditions. Ethics are a natural and powerful part of what it is to be human, but ethics requires empathy. It is impossible to empathize with a product but it is natural to empathize with people. Before the industrial revolution, people knew the individuals who made their goods. Having this connection, not only made it easy for people to empathize with these individuals but it also allowed them to see how their actions affected the market place and the people who made their good. Because ipoura is a large scale social connection, you won’t have to read each individual’s bio; the mere act of being willing to connect with companies who share your values will be enough to change the marketplace.</p><h2><b>Are we activists?</b></h2><p>No. In order for this to work, we must remain neutral and allow companies and consumers to communicate their values directly to each other. We do not need to be activists though because they already exist. With the presence of a social connection, when activists find hypocrisy within the marketplace the result will be customers switching to competitors. The specific results would depend on what is important to our end users. If you buy American products, and that is what’s important to you, you will be affecting the American economy. If foreign labor conditions are more of an issue for you, then that is where your impact will be.

<div>In the long term, your support will help us continue development and create a clinical version of the ADAFlow for FDA approval and treatment of circulation related disease. By helping us get a commercial ADAFlow off the ground, we can begin clinical trials and the FDA approval process.</div><div>Many circulation related diseases including Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), Lymphadema, and Congestive Heart Failure affect millions of people every year. Current solutions include static and dynamic compression therapies. Static therapies, such as compression stockings, are not especially effective and can be uncomfortable after some time. Dynamic therapy devices are usually bulky, expensive and use relatively slow acting air bladders that apply uniform pressure across a patient's leg. This method can help with circulation, but is inefficient and doesn't work synchronously with a person's heart.</div><div>We at Magzor devised novel technology to combat lack of blood flow. The mechanism generates a pressure wave via peristaltic motion to promote blood flow. We have also designed a method of feedback, whereby a patient's heart rate is used to trigger the mechanism. This way, the device is constantly working with the heart, and never against it.</div><div>Our hope is to develop this technology into a device that we can implement in clinical trials and prepare for FDA approval. The purpose of the trials is to show that the mechanism can dramatically improve blood flow, especially in patients with circulation conditions. </div><div><br/></div><h2><b>IMPORTANT!!</b></h2><div><b>While our ultimate goal is a clinically proven, FDA-approved version of the ADAFlow that combats circulation related ailments, the ADAFlow for this campaign is NOT intended to treat circulation diseases.

Our engineering team has expertise in biomechanics, mechatronics, robotics and biology. </div><div>Magzor has been awarded government contracts for its advanced research initiatives and during conceptualizing a ""smartsuit"" to monitor and aid wounded soldiers in the field, we made an unexpected and exciting discovery.

The ADAFlow uses a patented peristaltic motion mechanism to generate pressure waves. The novel mechanism contracts segments of the wrap around your leg in a timed sequence. Both the timing and force of contraction can be adjusted to achieve optimal relief to your personal liking.








The AdaFlow technology is a radical departure from the existing compression devices available today. Typical hospital devices are bulky, mostly involve air bladders that only pump and do not create a wave in one direction, are slow and not efficient. Other electrical stimulation devices are expensive and wasteful as the entire device needs to be replaced periodically. Ada Flow addresses all of these issues with its mobile, compact design that makes this unique pressure wave technology available to the everyday user.




OUR GOAL - $65,000 in funding to bring ADAFlow to the consumer



We have developed an advanced prototype and now we need your help to bring ADAFlow to the consumer. Reaching this funding goal will enable us to finalize the ADAFlow design for manufacture and ship it out to you. We have our manufacturers and distributors lined up and all we need are the funds to bring our prototype to a production model for mass production. By supporting our campaign, you will be part of bringing this novel technology to the market.

STRETCH GOAL - $110,000 in funding for ADAFlow with Smart Phone Control




Help us reach our stretch goal and we will be able to offer a version of ADAFlow that is bluetooth capable. ADAFlow bluetooth will come with a companion app that gives you all of the control you find in the original ADAFlow from your smartphone or tablet. In addition, the app will allow you to set a schedule for running the ADAFlow so that if you are at your desk for 8 hours, for example, you can schedule the ADAFlow to run for 10 minute intervals every hour; just set it and get on with your day!





""Our ultimate goal is to create a version of the ADAflow that can help in the treatment of a myriad of circulation related diseases""


In the long term, your support will help us continue development and create a clinical version of the ADAFlow for FDA approval and treatment of circulation related disease. By helping us get a commercial ADAFlow off the ground, we can begin clinical trials and the FDA approval process.Many circulation related diseases including Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), Lymphadema, and Congestive Heart Failure affect millions of people every year. Current solutions include static and dynamic compression therapies. Static therapies, such as compression stockings, are not especially effective and can be uncomfortable after some time. Dynamic therapy devices are usually bulky, expensive and use relatively slow acting air bladders that apply uniform pressure across a patient's leg. This method can help with circulation, but is inefficient and doesn't work synchronously with a person's heart.We at Magzor devised novel technology to combat lack of blood flow. The mechanism generates a pressure wave via peristaltic motion to promote blood flow. We have also designed a method of feedback, whereby a patient's heart rate is used to trigger the mechanism. This way, the device is constantly working with the heart, and never against it.Our hope is to develop this technology into a device that we can implement in clinical trials and prepare for FDA approval. The purpose of the trials is to show that the mechanism can dramatically improve blood flow, especially in patients with circulation conditions. IMPORTANT!!While our ultimate goal is a clinically proven, FDA-approved version of the ADAFlow that combats circulation related ailments, the ADAFlow for this campaign is NOT intended to treat circulation diseases. If you are someone who wants to use the ADAFlow and have some sort of condition, please consult with your physician before using the device.OUR STORYMagzor Corp. is a small startup company and we have been developing robotic technologies for the past 6 years. Our engineering team has expertise in biomechanics, mechatronics, robotics and biology. Magzor has been awarded government contracts for its advanced research initiatives and during conceptualizing a ""smartsuit"" to monitor and aid wounded soldiers in the field, we made an unexpected and exciting discovery. We realized that we could develop a new type of device that could address circulation-related issues. This is how the AdaFlow was born.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

WATER SOLUBLE DIETARY FIBER IN SMOOTHIES ACTUALLY INTERFERES WITH NUTRIENT ABSORPTIONSmoothies contain water soluble dietary fiber, which reduces the absorption of nutrientssuch as beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein, and tocopherol into the body. JUICE FOR YOUR HEALTH With a glass of Joothie juice, you can easily ingest more of the daily recommended amount of 7 plates of fruits and vegetables! HIGHER ABSORPTION RATECompared to eating fruits and vegetables, drinking them in juice-form increases the nutrient absorption rate by four times. EVEN SEEDS AND PEELSEnjoy even more nutrition in your fruit and vegetable juices by including seeds and peels.THE KEY TO GOOD HEALTH IS IN NATURE!!! Two Different Types of JuicersThe most easily found type of juicer is a centrifugal juice extractor. These use a high-speed metal blade which chops up the fruit or vegetables and spins the pulp against a mesh filter. The centrifugal force from the spinning separates juice from pulp and sends the juice out through the machine. These are the least expensive types of juicers, and they’re fine if you’re only going to use the juice in cooking, where the heat will break down the nutrients anyway, or if you’re only processing harder fruits and vegetables. They don’t handle leafy greens or softer fruits and veggies. Centrifugal juicers are also very noisy (Motor power 1500 W) and the juice tends to be foamy since air gets in during the spinning process. The juice separates easily and quickly and as a result can’t be saved but instead must be consumed soon after juicing. The spinning process itself produces heat, which can destroy some of the nutritional value in the food being juiced, so this is clearly not the proper equipment for a serious juicing enthusiast. Key benefitsDUAL STAGE JUICINGThe juice is extracted by crushing during the first stage and once again in the pressing phase before the pulp is ejected, which means more juice and maximum dry pulp.SILENCEMinimized noise during the rather slowly pressing and high speed milling.HEALTHYSlow Juicer extracts maximum flavor and nutrients of any fruit or vegetable without altering the natural properties thereof.EASY TO CLEANSimply rinse with water between uses without removing it. It is also easily removable for thorough cleaning.ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE / SUPERIORIt extracts a maximum amount of juice using less food and thereby helps save on grocery bills and energy.VERSATILE JUICEIt is not only limited to juices with fruit, vegetables, leafy greens or wheat grass, but also works for juices with nuts .KID-FRIENDLYNo sharp blades and highly effective security features.",19.0,0,"1 Campaign

    on the increase, in cities and out in the great outdoors. So what do you need
    to know if you do decide to strap on your running shoes after dark and how do
    you get fit and stay safe?Like
    in the dark drivers won°Øt expect to see you. They will assume that the roads
    will be largely deserted and drive accordingly. It is more important than ever
    to make sure they do see you, especially at junctions when drivers are tempted
    to jump lights and take risks they just would not take when it°Øs busier in
    daylight hours.

<p><strong>UPDATE! Signet reviews have started to come in!</strong><br/><br/>The Aqua Kink on the Signet: A Toy with Multiple Uses - <a href=""http://aquakink.com/a-toy-with-multiple-uses-funkit-toys-signet-review/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://aquakink.com/a-toy-with-multiple-uses-fu...</a><br/><br/><br/><strong>The Funkit Signet is a body-safe, platinum silicone ring to add texture to your hands for intimate play.</strong><br/><br/>Hand sex is an often-ignored activity in sex toy design. The existing vibrating rings are often made of toxic jelly rubber and designed to be disposable. Personally, I prefer holding a vibrator to putting a weak one on my fingertip. Rather than turn your hands into a low-power vibrator, the Signet is Your Hands, plus texture.<br/><br/>There are two existing Signet designs: The Groove, with soft horizontal ridges and valleys for rubbing, and the Nib, with stimulating bumps for direct points of pressure.

The rings were easy to use; slip the signet on and you’re good to go (if you use gloves, put a bit of lube on the ring first). Once the Signet rings are married with a professional mold, they will be as beautiful as they are pleasurable. The sensations against my g-spot were majestic, and left me hungry for more. They're definitely sex toys fit for a (pillow) princess!”<br/>-Rebecca Hiles, The Frisky Fairy<br/><br/><strong>Here's what you get:</strong></p>
<p>If you're in any reward tier above Pen Pal and this campaign reaches its minimum goal, you're getting at least one professionally injection molded, black Signet ring.

<li>Finished mold with side-pull: $6,080-7,000</li>
<li>Professional Design Software for CNC milling: $995</li>
<li>Packaging and shipping: $3-5 for US shipping per shipment, $9.50 for Canada, $13.50 abroad, plus any increases in price between now and the actual ship date</li>
<li>​Materials, production, and paying the fine people who work on the production line</li>

<p>Ultimately, I've decided this needs to raise $12,000 to produce the first run of Signet Grooves.

<p><br/>Hi, I’m Kenton, the lead designer for Funkit Toys. I've been researching toy design and materials since before I was old enough to buy them, *cough* and have been making my own professionally for nearly two years. I started Funkit Toys by teaching myself 3D modeling and printing molds of my own designs on a homemade 3d printer. I've since upgraded my equipment, but I still have ideas that are too elaborate for homemade molds. I want to make new ways for people to please themselves and their partners. I think the Signet is a really fun addition to my toybox. I’ve been using it for months, and making them for testers to get feedback to improve it. Now it’s ready, and I want to share it with all of you. For that, I need your help funding professionally milled injection molds. If you can help fund the Signet, it'll prove some of my more unusual ideas are viable for production.</p> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I've been releasing a sex toy every month since April. Many of my larger, simpler designs are already out there, being enjoyed, but the level of detail needed by the Signet and some of my more complicated ideas is beyond my capacity to do alone. By funding this, you'll not only be funding more fun hand sex, you'll be making other, more complicated Funkit Toys possible in the months ahead. I have a lot of fun, sexy ideas I want to bring to life, and you can help me make that happen.</p>
<h3>What are the risks?</h3>
<p>By prototyping, testing, and tweaking the first two designs before even starting this campaign, I've already mitigated the biggest risk: I already know they work for people. There are more bloggers releasing reviews over the course of the campaign as well, and I’m very excited to share those with you as this goes on.<br/><br/>By setting a minimum funding level, I’ve also mitigated the biggest risk to you: This campaign won’t go forward if I can’t afford to make and ship what you order.<br/><br/>While hand size varies a great deal, the Signet is made of stretchy silicone. Even stretched over two fingers as you saw in the intro video, it maintains a good comfort level. If it’s too large, yo can also secure it with a glove or finger cot.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you aren't in a position to buy a Signet now, the best way to support it is to tell someone you know who can, to ask your local sex toy store about carrying them so there are some for sale when you can, emailing your favorite sex toy bloggers about it and letting them know what we're doing here. While I've been making friends in the sex educator community for years, my own following is pretty small, so anyone you can tell is one more person who might help. Indiegogo would like me to remind you their share tools are the best way to do this, because that way Indiegogo knows people are excited about this too. They're right, you know.<br/> </p>

<p>Designed by Vladimir Laurent, The ManShield will help to solve major, yet intimate problems that men face on a daily basis—the risk of contamination to genitals, when using the toilet.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><u><strong>Medical Benefits &amp; Applications</strong></u></h3>
<p>When any surgery to the male genitalia leaves an incision or a healing wound on or near the scrotum, it is important that this wound is shielded from any form of moisture—most certainly wetness from toilet water, which is difficult to avoid while sitting on the toilet. With prostate cancer being the second leading cause of death among men in the United States, this product will serve as a mandatory household item for many if not all.</p>

<h3><u><strong>How It Started:</strong></u></h3>
<p>    I was out with my lady one day. And as we were going through our day, I realize that women do so many things to maintain their beauty and health. Everything from reaching in a purse to pull out a mirror to check their make up or using the restroom to make sure all is well below. Men often are not as attentive to their hygiene and health needs. We will use the restroom and some of us won't even wash our hands when we are finished. Which furthered my thoughts. How can we as men better our hygiene?<br/><br/>     I was sitting in my office one day and came up with an idea. When men sit down in the restroom, especially as we grow older, our scrotums begin to hang a little lower. Sometimes, hanging so low that they will dip into the very restroom water that has now been soiled. I wondered how many potential diseases and micro organisms we could be exposing ourselves to. So, I started doing my research. Finding out that there are more case than you probably think of contracting an infection from allowing the male genitals to come in contact with this dirty water. For women, the numbers are even higher. But it came to me. What if I have a product that will support the scrotum as well as guarding from the splash of dirty restroom water. Protecting your penis and testicles from the danger of infection. I called a trusted family member and friend and told him my idea. Immediately he began to laugh and asked me "" Man, where do you come up with this (expletive)?"" But after he laughed he looked at me and said "" Man, this is so crazy and not thought about. You might actually have something."" That was the first confirmation I received and it meant a lot. I decided to approach another friend, who actually is now my business partner, and pitched her the idea. What is now a normal first reaction she laughed.  But after thinking about it and being an excellent business woman herself, she called me back the next day and said "" let's go for it!"" Two confirmations.  That was all I needed to let me know we might have something.<br/> But as this journey progressed and I began to research, design and go through the necessary protocols,  I realized there are so many men who have suffered in silence with the issue of having to hold their scrotums out of the water while using the restroom. We as human beings have very few pleasurable and stress-relieving moments, the restroom being one of them. Why not make the experience as comfortable and peaceful as possible? Many of us like to read a magazine or check our emails all in the comfort of the restroom. Why add on the task of holding your scrotum out of the water and trying to read your favorite magazine at the same time. Why not just clip The ManShield to the commode and read The Wall Street Journal in peace.</p>

Sometimes, hanging so low that they will dip into the very restroom water that has now been soiled. I wondered how many potential diseases and micro organisms we could be exposing ourselves to. So, I started doing my research. Finding out that there are more case than you probably think of contracting an infection from allowing the male genitals to come in contact with this dirty water. For women, the numbers are even higher. But it came to me. What if I have a product that will support the scrotum as well as guarding from the splash of dirty restroom water. Protecting your penis and testicles from the danger of infection. I called a trusted family member and friend and told him my idea. Immediately he began to laugh and asked me "" Man, where do you come up with this (expletive)?"" But after he laughed he looked at me and said "" Man, this is so crazy and not thought about. You might actually have something."" That was the first confirmation I received and it meant a lot. I decided to approach another friend, who actually is now my business partner, and pitched her the idea. What is now a normal first reaction she laughed.  But after thinking about it and being an excellent business woman herself, she called me back the next day and said "" let's go for it!"" Two confirmations.  That was all I needed to let me know we might have something. But as this journey progressed and I began to research, design and go through the necessary protocols,  I realized there are so many men who have suffered in silence with the issue of having to hold their scrotums out of the water while using the restroom. We as human beings have very few pleasurable and stress-relieving moments, the restroom being one of them. Why not make the experience as comfortable and peaceful as possible? Many of us like to read a magazine or check our emails all in the comfort of the restroom. Why add on the task of holding your scrotum out of the water and trying to read your favorite magazine at the same time. Why not just clip The ManShield to the commode and read The Wall Street Journal in peace.

 

How You Can Help
We are seeking $35,000 in startup capital, with the funds being allocated towards mold and mass production, packaging, and marketing. For your contributions, we offer several exciting perks, from a variety of promotional items, to a supply of The ManShield product, and a pamphlet with information on the product itself. Become a Royalty Supporter and receive an exclusive invitation to our Red-Carpet launch event, with 2 Nights Hotel Accommodations. Best of all, you’ll know that you are contributing to a life-changing cause. If the entire goal of $35,000 is not met, this will slow our production, though we know that with your contributions, we can expedite the process of bringing this product to retail stores and public and private restrooms.
 
The ManShield is patented and currently there is nothing else like it on the market. One of our biggest challenges still, is securing the capital to fully back the product and market it around the world. We understand that some of you may not be able to contribute, but even a simple share of this campaign with family, friends, and colleagues could make a difference.

</div></div>","The main ingredient of ""Clay Rose"" collection are Goat Milk and different sorts of clay (according to soap name: white, yellow, red, pink, blue).
Goat Milk softens and moisturizes the skin, it contains vitamins A, B6, B12 and E. Goat milk contains three times more beta-casein than cow's milk. Casein is easily absorbed by the skin and quickly saturates it with moisture. Triglycerides, capric and caproic acid, contained in goat milk, help regulate the natural balance of skin pH, and also contribute to the natural exfoliation of dry skin.

 White clay or kaolin has a regenerating property. It is an excellent antiseptic and a wonderful helper in the fight against problematic and acne prone skin. White clay collects slag, toxins, dead cells of the epidermis, excess fat and saturates the skin with minerals. It is best for oily, thin and sensitive skin.

 

 Yellow clay contains a large amount of iron and potassium. It removes harmful toxins in inflammatory processes such as acne. Yellow clay is an excellent tonic, significantly improves the complexion and enriches the skin with oxygen.

 

 Red clay is rich in oxides of copper and iron, and also contains silicon.

</div></div></div>","Give millions of Deaf or Hard of Hearing people around the world new opportunities. The possibility to call anybody and anywhere is taken for granted in present days. However, this is not true for more than 450 million people around the globe with hearing loss. Hear-o will give this opportunity to all of us.

 

Just open Hear-o app and start signing in ASL to your smartphone's camera. Hear-o's artificial intelligence understands what you want to express, translates gestures to text and creates a clear voice to the recipient. 

 

We have the skills and technical experience to create the Hear-o. We have decided to develop this application for free, and we will provide Hear-o to Deaf and Hard of Hearing community without any fees. However, we need your support for the collection and processing of more than 1000 hours of video material capturing signing people. Video collection and subsequent transcription of the sign language will be more than 80% of our work on the Hear-o. Only with this data, we will be able to train properly working artificial intelligence.

 

Hear-o is not just about making phone calls. It will help Deaf or Hard of Hearing person with everything from ordering her favorite drink to describing to a mechanic what is wrong with her car at a garage or presenting her brilliant idea to her colleagues during a meeting.

<h3>The problem</h3>
<p>Millions of people wear face masks to lessen the spread of the coronavirus. Many professions require wearing a mask for hours every single day. Face masks are mandatory for school children in many countries.</p>
<p>Wearing a mask can cause:</p>
<ul>
<li> “Maskne,” acne that is caused because the mask traps dirt and oil in pores,</li>
<li>Miliaria, also known as heat rash, can result from occlusion and sweat under the mask,</li>
<li>Rosacea,</li>

<h3>The solution</h3>
<p>In addition to making sure your mask fits properly, keeping your mask clean and changing it at least twice a day, you need to start a<strong> “maskne” skincare routine</strong> that includes applying a moisturizer containing <strong>humectants and emollients</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Humectants</strong> prevent water from evaporating from the surface of the skin, and help keep the skin hydrated. Humectants also promote the shedding of dead cells by breaking down the proteins that hold the cells together. Humectants can be used by all skin types. </p>
<p><strong>Emollients</strong> help to repair the skin barrier function, making the skin feel and look smooth. Using emollients can help to fill in the spaces between dead skin cells where the barrier has become depleted - ultimately leading to soft hydrated skin. Only non-comedogenic emollients can be used by all skin types.</p>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>We have been working on finding the best solution for over four years. Many hours of research and self-built prototypes provided confidence in the overall design and a firm basis on which to engage with a professional design team. Cube3 where chosen for their proven experience in developing products from concept to production. The brief to deliver an aesthetically pleasing yet efficient and functional product at times was challenging but the team delivered on time and in budget. Prototype testing has been extensive and highlighted a few minor areas that we could improve. Another round of prototypes and testing proved the modifications successful. All major components and manufacturing partners have been sourced and timelines for delivery agreed and we are now ready to move to production.  </p>

Risks & Challenges
We have been working on finding the best solution for over four years. Many hours of research and self-built prototypes provided confidence in the overall design and a firm basis on which to engage with a professional design team. Cube3 where chosen for their proven experience in developing products from concept to production. The brief to deliver an aesthetically pleasing yet efficient and functional product at times was challenging but the team delivered on time and in budget. Prototype testing has been extensive and highlighted a few minor areas that we could improve. Another round of prototypes and testing proved the modifications successful. All major components and manufacturing partners have been sourced and timelines for delivery agreed and we are now ready to move to production.

<p><strong><a href=""https://www.sweatbox1.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SweatBox</a></strong> (Design Patent Obtained - Utility Patent Pending) an innovative kinetically designed fitness training platform designed by Fitness Professionals for the purpose of performing Resistance (Anaerobic) Training Exercises and Cardio Conditioning (Aerobic) Exercises all on one piece of equipment without the burden of having to own various pieces of  gym equipment.  Its unique design targets the Core (Lumbo Pelvic Hip Complex) with every exercise performed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>SweatBox </strong>empowers people to get fit by creating an environment of anticipation, enthusiasm, creativity, and freedom through performing hundreds of resistance training exercises, which result in a healthier, happier, and longer life.              </p>
<p><strong>SweatBox</strong> was designed and developed by personal trainers and coaches alike who understand how the body's systems react to different stressors placed on it through resistance training exercises. Combining various resistance training exercises into intervals, forming a circuit, is one of the most proven ways to get fit and healthy. </p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://www.nomoreexcusesgetfit.com/circuit-training-.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Circuit Training</a></strong> focuses on both metabolic systems of the body, aerobic and anaerobic. By combining aerobic and anaerobic (resistance training) exercises into a circuit, it allows the body to burn the maximal amount of calories in the least amount of time. Furthermore, studies have shown that performing resistance training exercises (bodyweight anaerobic exercises) increases lean muscle mass. Lean muscle mass increases the body's metabolism and helps to reduce ""Free Fatty Acids"" in the blood stream that reap havoc on the body's metabolic systems. So if you're serious about wanting to better your physique and obtain a healthier body by improving your body's Physiological systems (muscular, nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory, skeletal, endocrine, and psychological), then the SweatBox is for you! </p>
<h3>The Core</h3>
<p>The Core is the body’s foundation, center of gravity, and is where all movement originates. If you have a weak or dysfunctional core, then all other interconnected joints and muscles of your lower body (below the hip), and the upper body (above the hip), will have muscle imbalances which can result in improper movements and lead to injury. Therefore, it is imperative that you begin first with exercises that focus on training and strengthening the muscles of the “Lumbo Pelvic Hip Complex,” or core of the body. (The video below contains many core exercises) Note: The SweatBox used in this video is the ex-large version, but all exercises in this video can be performed on any size SweatBox.) </p>

<h3>About Us - SweatBox Team</h3>
<p>Steve, the creator of SweatBox, is a <a href=""http://www.nomoreexcusesgetfit.com/about-us.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Certified Personal Trainer</a> (NASM), fitness coach, sports coach, and life coach who instructs clients in calisthenics, plyometrics, weight-lifting, athletic competition, high-Intensity circuit training, and nutrition. He creates fitness systems that educate, motivate, and instruct clients in reaching their fitness goals and full potential.</p>
<p>My team and I set out to design a fitness platform that would provide the exerciser a tool that would allow him or her to perform hundreds of different resistance training exercisers all on one piece of equipment without the burden of having to move around from one piece of equipment to another. SweatBox kinetically combines numerous pieces of gym equipment like the flat and incline bench, stair-master, plyobox, aerobic stepper, dip, and push-up station into one simple creative platform making it easy to obtain a full body workout. Furthermore, with the ability of the add-ons of the Resistance Bands and Parallette Bars, it provides the user the versatility of having a cable machine and parallel bars all in one piece of equipment. Another exciting benefit of the SweatBox's design is its innovative ability to be latched together as one solid box or unlatched into two separate individual platforms<strong> </strong>which allow for even more freedom of creating various calisthenic, plyometric, and resistance training exercises.  </p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>All SweatBoxes Pictured Below Are Prototypes:<strong> </strong>The logo will either be routed into the wood in place of the decals, or an engraved hard plastic or metal plate will be debossed into the Sweatbox. There will not be decals! </p>
<p>(The Picture below shows the Sweatbox unlatched resulting in two separate platforms.) </p>

<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506096681/fuhdhbaclj3dgz7otsvt.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3><i><strong>Why Does SweatBox Work? Understanding the Science Behind the Invention!</strong></i></h3>
<p>Exercise begins in the mind with knowledge, knowing how the body reacts to different stressors/resistance placed on it during exercise. This type of understanding will determine the person's percentage of success in fitness. Example: Two people take a twenty minute walk daily, one loses an average of 3 pounds per week while the other barely loses 1 pound per week. What's the difference? Speed? No! One understands how the body reacts to the different stressors placed on it during exercise and therefore incorporates resistance training exercises intermixed with his walking, while the other just walks, maintaining the same speed and heart rate through-out the entire walk.  </p>
<p>The overall objective/goal for a person when he or she exercises is to guard/maintain as much muscle as possible during exercise while burning the most fat. When a person performs long bouts of cardio exercises, the body enters into ""guard mode,"" meaning that the body begins to use a percentage of muscle for energy as a way to preserve fat. </p>
<p>The body is designed to predetermine what stressors are placed on it at all times for the purpose of protecting itself against injury and for survival. As soon as a person even begins to think of performing a single movement or exercise, the brain immediately begins to send messages/signals to the nervous system so it can begin to recruit the proper muscles in order to perform the movement. By doing this it prepares the body's muscles against an immediate shock or blow. (Note: This is why stretching is important before exercise.)   </p>
<p>When an exerciser maintains and builds muscle while at the same time maintaining an elevated heat rate, his or her body enters into a longer post exercise burn of energy which allows the body to continue to use more calories (some being from fat) as energy to repair the torn muscle fibers. This should be the goal of every exerciser who is looking to improve his or her health and get fit. (This is why bodybuilders have to consume more protein in order to maintain their physique and even more if they are wanting to build more muscle, to rebuild the torn muscle fibers.) </p>
<h3><i><strong>So What's The Secret?</strong></i></h3>
<p>The secret, which has been out for many years, thanks to science and sports medicine, is to create an exercise routine that maintains and builds muscle, all the while burning fat. This is accomplished by performing resistance training exercises intermixed with cardio, which is why the SweatBox was created with its unique design. It provides the user an innovative tool to perform bodyweight resistance training exercises that maintain and build muscle while also providing a platform that allows for a mix-in of cardio to burn fat. Maintaining the heart rate in the appropriate zone for the appropriate amount of time will produce the results the exerciser is looking for.         </p>
<p><strong>(Note:</strong> Results will vary depending on a person's HR - Heart Rate and physical condition!) Heart Rate is determined by age, weight, gender, health condition, medication, caffeine and alcohol consumption, diet, and sleep.  <strong>(Note:</strong> See your doctor before beginning and performing any exercise program!)</p>

<h3><strong>Versatility/Mobility</strong></h3>
<p>The versatility of the SweatBox being mobile is very important as it allows the exerciser to take the SweatBox to different locations inside the house and outdoors, like to the park, beach, or on a trip allowing him or her to change up the environment of the workout. Studies show that changing up the fitness environment increases his or her percentage of successfully completing a workout and the longevity of the fitness program meaning that he or she will stick with it longer. Sticking with a fitness regimen on a consistent basis is the challenge and key to seeing positive results.     </p>
<h3><strong>For All Fitness Levels</strong></h3>
<p>Not only is the <strong>SweatBox</strong><i><strong> </strong></i>a serious piece of equipment that provides the exerciser the ability to get into top shape, but it is very fun to use because of its versatility and variety of resistance exercises. Whether the person is a beginner or expert, <i>SweatBox</i> will challenge his or her level of fitness! <i>SweatBox</i> gives the user the power to get fit and intensify his or her workouts because of it's innovative design.     </p>
<h3><strong>Due Diligence</strong></h3>
<p>With two years in the making and six prototypes later, I believe our team (SweatBoxTeam)  has done it! All prototypes have been tested and used by common everyday people, fitness clients, fitness coaches, and personal trainers to be sure SweatBox produces the expected results. Please support our exciting campaign as this is only the beginning of many more innovative products to come! </p>
<h3><strong>It's not just about the money, but integrity! </strong></h3>
<p>Many fitness companies and manufacturers do not have your best interest in mind. It's more about the money than creating a quality product that actually benefits you. We are bombarded daily by so many fitness gadgets and gimmicks which makes it hard to clearly understand which product will actually benefit us in helping produce results. <i>The truth is, getting healthy and fit, feeling and looking good, only come by a combination of practicing proper nutrition and applying effort in exercise daily in one's life.</i> It's impossible to ""out exercise"" junk food and excessive calories no matter what exercise apparatus you use and claims companies make. With that said, we, the <strong>SweatBox Team</strong>, are not going to make the false claim that if you just step up onto the box for 10 minutes a day you'll lose all that fat and transform your body! Anything that has value requires effort and an investment of time. Getting healthy requires effort, persistence, consistency, and a daily healthy diet. No More Excuses - get fit!   </p>
<h3><strong>How do you know if a fitness product is a gimmick?</strong></h3>
<p>The general rule of thumb is if a fitness product is promoted as not requiring much physical effort and time, then it is probably a gimmick and too good to be true. Furthermore, without physical effort, the most important element for the purpose of fitness, is left out of the equation which is to challenge and increase the heart rate resulting in engaging the body's Physiological  Systems - muscular, nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory, skeletal, endocrine, immune, and psychological. This is what leads to a healthy body.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.highya.com/articles-guides/there-is-no-such-thing-as-spot-fat-loss"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>There’s No Such Thing as “Spot Fat Loss”</strong></a></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Being Healthy and Fit Begins on the Inside!</strong></h3>
<p>A good looking, healthy and fit body begins from the inside out, beginning with the body's Physiological Systems of the body, then the core muscles (which are all muscles associated with the Lumbo Pelvic Hip Complex) and finally the muscle groups that make up the lower and upper extremities of the body. Take the easy way out focusing on just the outside-the body's appearance, and you are only applying a band-aid, a temporally fix, and not engaging the operating systems of the body that get you healthy. You are cheating yourself!  </p>
<p><a href=""https://www.sweatbox1.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>SweatBox</strong> </a>provides a fitness platform that focuses on one of the most important parts of the body, the core. The body's core (muscles associated with the Lumbo Pelvic Hip Complex) is the body's foundation and is where all movement begins. Body weight resistance training exercises like Push-Ups, Isometric and Dynamic Planks, V-Sit, L-Sit, Raised Leg Lifts, Dynamic Crunches, Mountain Climbers, and many others focus on strengthening the body's core. When your core is healthy and strong, it allows you to have even greater success performing exercise and lowers the percentage rate of injury during exercise and physical activty.            </p>
<h3>
<strong>Activity and exercise are not a choice!</strong> </h3>
<p>Studies have shown that most chronic diseases are associated with inactivity and a lack of exercise in one's life. Bottom line: The human body was designed to move, not sit all day. With the growth of technology racing off the charts and the ever increasing digital world in which we live, it has become even more challenging to get our bodies moving. The new ""smoking can be hazardous to your health"" is now ""sitting!"" Studies have shown that sitting for long periods on a consistent basis without movement is dangerous to our health and can actually lower a person's lifespan. It's like a car engine that just sits for days and weeks without use. The human body must be challenged to move in order to engage one of the most important muscles in the body, the heart. When the body moves, it causes the body's systems (physiological systems - muscular, nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory, skeletal, immune, endocrine, and psychological) to engage and respond, thus causing them to work as they are designed. Therefore, if you desire a healthy and fit body, longevity, and want to be around for a while for your family, then re-prioritize your life and incorporate one of the most important responsibilities into your daily schedule, exercise! Your life depends on it!</p>
<h3><strong>Don't Be a Statistic!</strong></h3>
<p>Over 70% of adults 20 years of age or older in the US are either overweight or obese - wow!​​​According to the CDC - Chronic Diseases such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer are the leading cause of death. In 2012, almost half of the US population of adults had at least one chronic disease - about 117 million adults.  Additionally, 1 out of every 4 adults had two or more chronic diseases. One-third of adults, about 78 million, are considered to be obese - 30 pounds or more over the recommended weight for their height. It's time to take action before you become a statistic! It's serious!</p>
<p>Inactivity is your enemy, not activity and exercise! Inactivity leads to a lack of energy which leads to laziness which results in even more laziness. It's a downward spiral effect that has to be reversed, and can only come through activity. So get off the couch, turn off the television or gaming device, and get your exercise on the <strong>SweatBox</strong> so you can begin reversing the Inactivity Lazy Syndrome. </p>
<h3>
<strong>Who's got time for the gym in these crazy days we live?</strong> </h3>
<p>You can ask anyone and almost always get the same answer...How are you doing today? Oh, I'm okay, but super busy! The question is...who's not busy these days?</p>
<p>With the time demands that gyms require like preparing your gym clothes, driving to and from the gym, working out, and then maybe even showering afterward and dressing, many people do not have the time to fulfill a gym membership.</p>
<p><strong>SweatBox </strong>with its innovative design, provides the user a tool to empower him or her to perform hundreds of resistance training exercises coupled with aerobic cardio movements to get him or her healthy and fit! it's time to ""step outside the box"" and experience fitness in a new way, <strong>SWEATBOX!     </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Is performing cardio exercises enough?</strong></h3>
<p>Performing cardio exercises, even though it will condition the cardiovascular, respiratory, and the other systems of the body, will only help a little with maintaining the body's muscle. Tests show that after an average of about 20 minutes of cardio exercise, the body begins to burn close to an equal percentage of muscle for energy as it does fat. Therefore, the overall objective during exercise is to build muscle while burning fat as we need to hold on to as much lean muscle mass as possible. Furthermore, it has been proven that as the body increases in lean muscle mass, it begins to burn more calories, which is required to repair the torn muscle fibers. Therefore, the body enters into a longer post calorie burn which should be the goal for anyone who is looking to get healthy and drop some pounds.  </p>
<p>Additionally, as one enters into his or her 30's he or she begins to lose an average of up to 10% of his or her muscle mass every year. Therefore, resistance training must be incorporated into one's life and begin to be part of his or her daily routine.      </p>
<h3> <strong>SWEATBOX Story</strong>
</h3>
<p>In January of 2015 my team and I set out to design an innovative fitness platform that would challenge the ""fitness status quo"" and allow the exerciser the freedom to perform hundreds of resistance training exercises all on one kinetically engineered platform without the burden of having to own multiple pieces of gym equipment. Additionally, we wanted the product to be free from moving parts so that no maintenance would be required saving the consumer even more money.</p>
<p><strong>SweatBox </strong>solves the frustrating and annoying problem of having to spend thousands of dollars for fitness equipment, maintenance, and then find a place to store them. Furthermore, it provides freedom for the exerciser to create his or her own movements and routines, therefore making the exercise experience adventurous and fun!  </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By supporting this <strong>SweatBox</strong> campaign you will provide the necessary resources to allows us, the SweatBox Team, to bring the SweatBox, along with its many accessories, fitness videos, and information to production, thus providing the opportunity for many people to get fit, healthy, and experience a new life.  </p>
<p>The human body was designed for movement; therefore, we must create exciting fitness tools that will encourage and motivate people to move daily on a regular basis resulting in a healthy, fit, and good looking body. The <strong>SweatBox</strong> Fitness Platform was designed with this in mind and is the perfect tool to help people obtain their fitness goals. </p>
<p><strong>With your support, </strong>you will be joining the <strong>SweatBox Team</strong> in launching the SweatBox into production and allowing us to get this innovative fitness tool to the world. Furthermore, this will allow us to continue in our mission of creating and developing more innovative fitness products that will encourage people to exercise, get healthy and fit, and experience a new life through performing resistance training exercises.  </p>
<h3><i><strong>OUR PASSION</strong></i></h3>
<p>We love to see people overcome obstacles and reach their fitness goals and full potential in all areas of their lives.</p>
<h3><i><strong>OUR MISSION</strong></i></h3>
<p>To design innovative fitness tools that create an environment of empowerment, anticipation, enthusiasm, creativity, and longevity that will encourage more people to exercise which will result in a healthier, fitter, and happier life by performing resistance training exercises.             </p>
<h3><i><strong>OUR VISION</strong></i></h3>
<p>To create an entirely new fitness experience using the <strong>SweatBox</strong> called <strong>SweatBotics. </strong>SweatBotics is taking resistance training exercises intertwined with dancing and performing them in robotic type form on the SweatBox thus creating an entirely new fitness experience. </p>
<p>When the body's muscles are challenged during movement (during the range of motion) to  stop at the beginning, middle, and end of an exercise, it causes the nervous system to have to recruit even more muscle fibers in order to perform the function. By doing this it places more stressors on the muscles, and the result is healthier, stronger, muscles. When combined with several dance moves, it's a combined resistance training and cardio workout that literal gets you excited, healthy, and fit to say the least!</p>
<p>Just imagine you're in a dark room, the dance lights come on, the music ignites, and the instructor steps up on the SweatBox along with the other dozen exercisers, and the workout begins! Everyone performs <strong>SweatBotics</strong> to the beat. Wow, now that's what I'm talking about!</p>
<p><i><strong>Please join our team by choosing a perk and help us take the first step in making this vision a reality! Thank you!   </strong></i></p>

<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>When you support and back our <strong>SWEATBOX campaign,</strong> not only will you receive an innovative <strong>SweatBox </strong>for performing hundreds of resistance training exercises, but you will also be joining the SweatBox community by taking part in bringing the SweatBox to production, which will provide many people a unique fitness tool that will encourage them to lose weight, get healthy and fit! </p>
<p><i><strong>Our Goal:</strong></i> To create, design and produce innovative high quality products that are unque, challenge the ""Stauts-Quo,"" encourage and empower people to get fit and healthy. We would rather produce a high quality product that costs a little more to manufacture, than an inexpensive cheap product that will not last. For us, it's about quality and integrity, not just about the numbers. Our product needs to be a win-win, which means a durable quality product priced fairly for our backers (fitness family), but at a price that will allow our team to launch the business successfully and not go broke in the process.</p>
<p>Another one of our main goals is to challenge the ""fitness status quo"" by designing unique quality products that create an environment of anticipation, enthusiasm, creativity, and freedom which results in greater success by allowing the exerciser to experience freedom in exercise. We want to move from fitness being just fitness, to fitness being an ""experience!"" That's another reason why the <strong>SweatBox</strong> was created with its innovative kinetic design, to give people a new and exciting experience!   </p>
<p>Our goal is set for $50,000.00 in order to bring the SweatBox into production. This is the breaking point for maintaining the cost of materials at a fairly affordable price. But if we can reach beyond the set goal then we will be well on our way as this will give us the proper amount of resources to position us for even greater success and produce the SweatBox at an even lower price which can be passed on to our community.     </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<p>With over two years of time invested, 6 prototypes, hundreds of hours of research and development, tests, patents pending, and many dollars invested into the SweatBox, we really need to hit our goal so we can take <strong>SweatBox</strong> to the next level, which is production. It needs to be CNC precisioned cut, and our proprietary parts need to be manufactured.</p>
<p>If we do not hit our goal then we will be at risk of losing the opportunity of bringing the SweatBox to production, not finishing the patents, and going broke, which would be devastating considering the amount of resources we have invested in the project over the last two years. But even the saddest part I believe would be that no one would ever be able to experience the exciting innovative SweatBox for him or herself.   </p>

SweatBox empowers people to get fit by creating an environment of anticipation, enthusiasm, creativity, and freedom through performing hundreds of resistance training exercises, which result in a healthier, happier, and longer life.              
SweatBox was designed and developed by personal trainers and coaches alike who understand how the body's systems react to different stressors placed on it through resistance training exercises. Combining various resistance training exercises into intervals, forming a circuit, is one of the most proven ways to get fit and healthy. 
Circuit Training focuses on both metabolic systems of the body, aerobic and anaerobic. By combining aerobic and anaerobic (resistance training) exercises into a circuit, it allows the body to burn the maximal amount of calories in the least amount of time. Furthermore, studies have shown that performing resistance training exercises (bodyweight anaerobic exercises) increases lean muscle mass. Lean muscle mass increases the body's metabolism and helps to reduce ""Free Fatty Acids"" in the blood stream that reap havoc on the body's metabolic systems. So if you're serious about wanting to better your physique and obtain a healthier body by improving your body's Physiological systems (muscular, nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory, skeletal, endocrine, and psychological), then the SweatBox is for you! 
The Core
The Core is the body’s foundation, center of gravity, and is where all movement originates. If you have a weak or dysfunctional core, then all other interconnected joints and muscles of your lower body (below the hip), and the upper body (above the hip), will have muscle imbalances which can result in improper movements and lead to injury. Therefore, it is imperative that you begin first with exercises that focus on training and strengthening the muscles of the “Lumbo Pelvic Hip Complex,” or core of the body. (The video below contains many core exercises) Note: The SweatBox used in this video is the ex-large version, but all exercises in this video can be performed on any size SweatBox.) 


 

About Us - SweatBox Team
Steve, the creator of SweatBox, is a Certified Personal Trainer (NASM), fitness coach, sports coach, and life coach who instructs clients in calisthenics, plyometrics, weight-lifting, athletic competition, high-Intensity circuit training, and nutrition. He creates fitness systems that educate, motivate, and instruct clients in reaching their fitness goals and full potential.
My team and I set out to design a fitness platform that would provide the exerciser a tool that would allow him or her to perform hundreds of different resistance training exercisers all on one piece of equipment without the burden of having to move around from one piece of equipment to another. SweatBox kinetically combines numerous pieces of gym equipment like the flat and incline bench, stair-master, plyobox, aerobic stepper, dip, and push-up station into one simple creative platform making it easy to obtain a full body workout. Furthermore, with the ability of the add-ons of the Resistance Bands and Parallette Bars, it provides the user the versatility of having a cable machine and parallel bars all in one piece of equipment. Another exciting benefit of the SweatBox's design is its innovative ability to be latched together as one solid box or unlatched into two separate individual platforms which allow for even more freedom of creating various calisthenic, plyometric, and resistance training exercises.  
Note: All SweatBoxes Pictured Below Are Prototypes: The logo will either be routed into the wood in place of the decals, or an engraved hard plastic or metal plate will be debossed into the Sweatbox. There will not be decals! 
(The Picture below shows the Sweatbox unlatched resulting in two separate platforms.) 

(The Picture below shows the SweatBox latched together resulting in one complete fitness platform.)  (Max Weight: 1 Person/250 lbs)

Why Does SweatBox Work? Understanding the Science Behind the Invention!
Exercise begins in the mind with knowledge, knowing how the body reacts to different stressors/resistance placed on it during exercise. This type of understanding will determine the person's percentage of success in fitness. Example: Two people take a twenty minute walk daily, one loses an average of 3 pounds per week while the other barely loses 1 pound per week. What's the difference? Speed? No! One understands how the body reacts to the different stressors placed on it during exercise and therefore incorporates resistance training exercises intermixed with his walking, while the other just walks, maintaining the same speed and heart rate through-out the entire walk.  
The overall objective/goal for a person when he or she exercises is to guard/maintain as much muscle as possible during exercise while burning the most fat. When a person performs long bouts of cardio exercises, the body enters into ""guard mode,"" meaning that the body begins to use a percentage of muscle for energy as a way to preserve fat. 
The body is designed to predetermine what stressors are placed on it at all times for the purpose of protecting itself against injury and for survival. As soon as a person even begins to think of performing a single movement or exercise, the brain immediately begins to send messages/signals to the nervous system so it can begin to recruit the proper muscles in order to perform the movement. By doing this it prepares the body's muscles against an immediate shock or blow. (Note: This is why stretching is important before exercise.)   
When an exerciser maintains and builds muscle while at the same time maintaining an elevated heat rate, his or her body enters into a longer post exercise burn of energy which allows the body to continue to use more calories (some being from fat) as energy to repair the torn muscle fibers. This should be the goal of every exerciser who is looking to improve his or her health and get fit. (This is why bodybuilders have to consume more protein in order to maintain their physique and even more if they are wanting to build more muscle, to rebuild the torn muscle fibers.) 
So What's The Secret?
The secret, which has been out for many years, thanks to science and sports medicine, is to create an exercise routine that maintains and builds muscle, all the while burning fat. This is accomplished by performing resistance training exercises intermixed with cardio, which is why the SweatBox was created with its unique design. It provides the user an innovative tool to perform bodyweight resistance training exercises that maintain and build muscle while also providing a platform that allows for a mix-in of cardio to burn fat. Maintaining the heart rate in the appropriate zone for the appropriate amount of time will produce the results the exerciser is looking for.         
(Note: Results will vary depending on a person's HR - Heart Rate and physical condition!) Heart Rate is determined by age, weight, gender, health condition, medication, caffeine and alcohol consumption, diet, and sleep.  (Note: See your doctor before beginning and performing any exercise program!)

Not only is the SweatBox a serious piece of equipment that provides the exerciser the ability to get into top shape, but it is very fun to use because of its versatility and variety of resistance exercises. Whether the person is a beginner or expert, SweatBox will challenge his or her level of fitness! SweatBox gives the user the power to get fit and intensify his or her workouts because of it's innovative design.     
Due Diligence
With two years in the making and six prototypes later, I believe our team (SweatBoxTeam)  has done it! All prototypes have been tested and used by common everyday people, fitness clients, fitness coaches, and personal trainers to be sure SweatBox produces the expected results. Please support our exciting campaign as this is only the beginning of many more innovative products to come! 
It's not just about the money, but integrity! 
Many fitness companies and manufacturers do not have your best interest in mind. It's more about the money than creating a quality product that actually benefits you. We are bombarded daily by so many fitness gadgets and gimmicks which makes it hard to clearly understand which product will actually benefit us in helping produce results. The truth is, getting healthy and fit, feeling and looking good, only come by a combination of practicing proper nutrition and applying effort in exercise daily in one's life. It's impossible to ""out exercise"" junk food and excessive calories no matter what exercise apparatus you use and claims companies make. With that said, we, the SweatBox Team, are not going to make the false claim that if you just step up onto the box for 10 minutes a day you'll lose all that fat and transform your body! Anything that has value requires effort and an investment of time. Getting healthy requires effort, persistence, consistency, and a daily healthy diet. No More Excuses - get fit!   
How do you know if a fitness product is a gimmick?
The general rule of thumb is if a fitness product is promoted as not requiring much physical effort and time, then it is probably a gimmick and too good to be true. Furthermore, without physical effort, the most important element for the purpose of fitness, is left out of the equation which is to challenge and increase the heart rate resulting in engaging the body's Physiological  Systems - muscular, nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory, skeletal, endocrine, immune, and psychological. This is what leads to a healthy body.
There’s No Such Thing as “Spot Fat Loss”
 
Being Healthy and Fit Begins on the Inside!
A good looking, healthy and fit body begins from the inside out, beginning with the body's Physiological Systems of the body, then the core muscles (which are all muscles associated with the Lumbo Pelvic Hip Complex) and finally the muscle groups that make up the lower and upper extremities of the body. Take the easy way out focusing on just the outside-the body's appearance, and you are only applying a band-aid, a temporally fix, and not engaging the operating systems of the body that get you healthy. You are cheating yourself!  
SweatBox provides a fitness platform that focuses on one of the most important parts of the body, the core. The body's core (muscles associated with the Lumbo Pelvic Hip Complex) is the body's foundation and is where all movement begins. Body weight resistance training exercises like Push-Ups, Isometric and Dynamic Planks, V-Sit, L-Sit, Raised Leg Lifts, Dynamic Crunches, Mountain Climbers, and many others focus on strengthening the body's core. When your core is healthy and strong, it allows you to have even greater success performing exercise and lowers the percentage rate of injury during exercise and physical activty.            

Activity and exercise are not a choice! 
Studies have shown that most chronic diseases are associated with inactivity and a lack of exercise in one's life. Bottom line: The human body was designed to move, not sit all day. With the growth of technology racing off the charts and the ever increasing digital world in which we live, it has become even more challenging to get our bodies moving. The new ""smoking can be hazardous to your health"" is now ""sitting!"" Studies have shown that sitting for long periods on a consistent basis without movement is dangerous to our health and can actually lower a person's lifespan. It's like a car engine that just sits for days and weeks without use. The human body must be challenged to move in order to engage one of the most important muscles in the body, the heart. When the body moves, it causes the body's systems (physiological systems - muscular, nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory, skeletal, immune, endocrine, and psychological) to engage and respond, thus causing them to work as they are designed. Therefore, if you desire a healthy and fit body, longevity, and want to be around for a while for your family, then re-prioritize your life and incorporate one of the most important responsibilities into your daily schedule, exercise! Your life depends on it!
Don't Be a Statistic!
Over 70% of adults 20 years of age or older in the US are either overweight or obese - wow!​​​According to the CDC - Chronic Diseases such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer are the leading cause of death. In 2012, almost half of the US population of adults had at least one chronic disease - about 117 million adults.  Additionally, 1 out of every 4 adults had two or more chronic diseases. One-third of adults, about 78 million, are considered to be obese - 30 pounds or more over the recommended weight for their height. It's time to take action before you become a statistic! It's serious!
Inactivity is your enemy, not activity and exercise! Inactivity leads to a lack of energy which leads to laziness which results in even more laziness. It's a downward spiral effect that has to be reversed, and can only come through activity. So get off the couch, turn off the television or gaming device, and get your exercise on the SweatBox so you can begin reversing the Inactivity Lazy Syndrome. 

Who's got time for the gym in these crazy days we live? 
You can ask anyone and almost always get the same answer...How are you doing today? Oh, I'm okay, but super busy! The question is...who's not busy these days?
With the time demands that gyms require like preparing your gym clothes, driving to and from the gym, working out, and then maybe even showering afterward and dressing, many people do not have the time to fulfill a gym membership.
SweatBox with its innovative design, provides the user a tool to empower him or her to perform hundreds of resistance training exercises coupled with aerobic cardio movements to get him or her healthy and fit! it's time to ""step outside the box"" and experience fitness in a new way, SWEATBOX!     
Is performing cardio exercises enough?
Performing cardio exercises, even though it will condition the cardiovascular, respiratory, and the other systems of the body, will only help a little with maintaining the body's muscle. Tests show that after an average of about 20 minutes of cardio exercise, the body begins to burn close to an equal percentage of muscle for energy as it does fat. Therefore, the overall objective during exercise is to build muscle while burning fat as we need to hold on to as much lean muscle mass as possible. Furthermore, it has been proven that as the body increases in lean muscle mass, it begins to burn more calories, which is required to repair the torn muscle fibers. Therefore, the body enters into a longer post calorie burn which should be the goal for anyone who is looking to get healthy and drop some pounds.  
Additionally, as one enters into his or her 30's he or she begins to lose an average of up to 10% of his or her muscle mass every year. Therefore, resistance training must be incorporated into one's life and begin to be part of his or her daily routine.      
 SWEATBOX Story

In January of 2015 my team and I set out to design an innovative fitness platform that would challenge the ""fitness status quo"" and allow the exerciser the freedom to perform hundreds of resistance training exercises all on one kinetically engineered platform without the burden of having to own multiple pieces of gym equipment. Additionally, we wanted the product to be free from moving parts so that no maintenance would be required saving the consumer even more money.
SweatBox solves the frustrating and annoying problem of having to spend thousands of dollars for fitness equipment, maintenance, and then find a place to store them. Furthermore, it provides freedom for the exerciser to create his or her own movements and routines, therefore making the exercise experience adventurous and fun!  
The Impact
By supporting this SweatBox campaign you will provide the necessary resources to allows us, the SweatBox Team, to bring the SweatBox, along with its many accessories, fitness videos, and information to production, thus providing the opportunity for many people to get fit, healthy, and experience a new life.  
The human body was designed for movement; therefore, we must create exciting fitness tools that will encourage and motivate people to move daily on a regular basis resulting in a healthy, fit, and good looking body. The SweatBox Fitness Platform was designed with this in mind and is the perfect tool to help people obtain their fitness goals. 
With your support, you will be joining the SweatBox Team in launching the SweatBox into production and allowing us to get this innovative fitness tool to the world. Furthermore, this will allow us to continue in our mission of creating and developing more innovative fitness products that will encourage people to exercise, get healthy and fit, and experience a new life through performing resistance training exercises.  
OUR PASSION
We love to see people overcome obstacles and reach their fitness goals and full potential in all areas of their lives.
OUR MISSION
To design innovative fitness tools that create an environment of empowerment, anticipation, enthusiasm, creativity, and longevity that will encourage more people to exercise which will result in a healthier, fitter, and happier life by performing resistance training exercises.             
OUR VISION
To create an entirely new fitness experience using the SweatBox called SweatBotics. SweatBotics is taking resistance training exercises intertwined with dancing and performing them in robotic type form on the SweatBox thus creating an entirely new fitness experience. 
When the body's muscles are challenged during movement (during the range of motion) to  stop at the beginning, middle, and end of an exercise, it causes the nervous system to have to recruit even more muscle fibers in order to perform the function. By doing this it places more stressors on the muscles, and the result is healthier, stronger, muscles. When combined with several dance moves, it's a combined resistance training and cardio workout that literal gets you excited, healthy, and fit to say the least!
Just imagine you're in a dark room, the dance lights come on, the music ignites, and the instructor steps up on the SweatBox along with the other dozen exercisers, and the workout begins! Everyone performs SweatBotics to the beat. Wow, now that's what I'm talking about!
Please join our team by choosing a perk and help us take the first step in making this vision a reality! Thank you!   
          
SWEATBOX - TIMELINE
1. January 2015: Conception of Idea
2. January - March 2015: Sketch and rough draft
3. March - May 2015: Research and test the size and heights of each level of the SweatBox
4. May, 2015 - April 2016: Study and research patent process
5. May 2015: Brainstorm a name for the exercise platform
After brainstorming and considering many different names, we chose the name ""SweatBox"" as it was a perfect fit for how we wanted to describe and people to perceive the invention.
6. May - June 2015: Re-sketch and draft drawings with measurements for the platform's size and dimensions
We made some final sketches using what we believed to be the perfect dimensions for the first SweatBox.
7. July 2015: Build a physical model, 3D prototype
We built the first 3D prototype out of Styrofoam to get a visual of the size and measurements so we would not have to waste money using more expensive materials like wood, plastic, or metal.
8. July - August 2015: Built a working prototype to test the functionality of the platform
 
First SweatBox Prototype. 39 inches length x 44 inches wide   
9. July - September 2015: Patent Search
10. September - November 2015: Draft of professional drawings of the platform for a design patent and possible provisional patent
11. December 2015 - May 2016: Continue research on the design of the platform, prior art patent searches, and begin drafting information on design and provisional patents for the SweatBox.
12. June - August 2016: Research manufacturers and began the communication process
13. July 2016: Filed with a patent attorney the design patent application for the resistance training exercise platform
14. July 2016: Built an improved prototype

 Second SweatBox Prototype
We built an even better SweatBox prototype out of wood material. We continued to test this model and began circuit training on it. This was exciting as it provided the results we were hoping for.
15. August 2016: Enter into agreement with manufacturer to render engineering drawings and design two prototypes 
16. August 2016: Review and revise engineer drawings for two prototypes to be manufactured.
17. August - September 2016: Gather and write the description, drawings, and information needed for the provisional patent and file
18. September 2016 - February, 2017: Prepare for crowd funding campaign on Indiegogo
19. November 2016: Received prototypes from manufacturer...not satisfied with the delivered product.  
20. November 2016: Begin search for another manufacturer.  
21. December 2016: Add to the SweatBox Team.
22. January 2017: Build another prototype to calculate material costs and labor   
                      
                        Size: 42 inches in width x 37 inches in length - reduced the size from the first one.                                    
Our team built another prototype in order to calculate material and labor costs. We are leaning towards setting up shop and manufacturing the SweatBox ourselves.
During the process our team added the option of resistance bands: Wow -  what an amazing add-on! 

23. January - May 2017: Continue to add to and build the SweatBox Team.
24. March - June 2017: Prepare for videos and photos of the SweatBox prototype; begin shooting videos and taking photos for the story line of the SweatBox.
25. April - June 2017: Research manufacturers for resistance bands
26. June 2017: Create prototype of Parallette Bars.
 
27. May - June 2017: Test Resistance Bands and Parallette Bars
28. July 2017: Overcome Obstacles - Shipping: 1. Too much money to ship Sweatbox as one piece and not mobile friendly. 2. Too complicated for consumer to assemble. 
29. July - August 2017: Overcame Obstacles: New engineer drawings for split model; Built new prototype to be tested. Latches and unlatches together. Now two SweatBoxes in one with even more opportunities for exercise! Reduced the size again: New Size: 32 inches in width x 37 inches in length. The two individual 16 x 37 inch platforms come together to form One Solid SWEATBOX. Obstacles can be opportunities! Exciting! 
 Now can be affordably shipped and is mobile friendly! (Shipped as shown below)

         

SweatBox prototype which was used for testing the structure and functionality of the platform. Note: When SweatBox goes into production, the logo will either be routed into the wood or a rectangular logo plate will be made from either hard plastic or rubber material then fastened into a 2/16 inch routed space in place of the decals. (Decals were used only for the prototype.)  
30. June - August 2017: Continue preparing for the launch of the crowdfunding campaign: Indiegogo

What We Need & What You Get

When you support and back our SWEATBOX campaign, not only will you receive an innovative SweatBox for performing hundreds of resistance training exercises, but you will also be joining the SweatBox community by taking part in bringing the SweatBox to production, which will provide many people a unique fitness tool that will encourage them to lose weight, get healthy and fit! 
Our Goal: To create, design and produce innovative high quality products that are unque, challenge the ""Stauts-Quo,"" encourage and empower people to get fit and healthy. We would rather produce a high quality product that costs a little more to manufacture, than an inexpensive cheap product that will not last. For us, it's about quality and integrity, not just about the numbers. Our product needs to be a win-win, which means a durable quality product priced fairly for our backers (fitness family), but at a price that will allow our team to launch the business successfully and not go broke in the process.
Another one of our main goals is to challenge the ""fitness status quo"" by designing unique quality products that create an environment of anticipation, enthusiasm, creativity, and freedom which results in greater success by allowing the exerciser to experience freedom in exercise. We want to move from fitness being just fitness, to fitness being an ""experience!"" That's another reason why the SweatBox was created with its innovative kinetic design, to give people a new and exciting experience!   
Our goal is set for $50,000.00 in order to bring the SweatBox into production. This is the breaking point for maintaining the cost of materials at a fairly affordable price. But if we can reach beyond the set goal then we will be well on our way as this will give us the proper amount of resources to position us for even greater success and produce the SweatBox at an even lower price which can be passed on to our community.     
Risks & Challenges

With over two years of time invested, 6 prototypes, hundreds of hours of research and development, tests, patents pending, and many dollars invested into the SweatBox, we really need to hit our goal so we can take SweatBox to the next level, which is production. It needs to be CNC precisioned cut, and our proprietary parts need to be manufactured.
If we do not hit our goal then we will be at risk of losing the opportunity of bringing the SweatBox to production, not finishing the patents, and going broke, which would be devastating considering the amount of resources we have invested in the project over the last two years. But even the saddest part I believe would be that no one would ever be able to experience the exciting innovative SweatBox for him or herself.

<p></p>
<p>A while back after a long bike ride I noticed that every time I went out for a ride, the gloves I was wearing would leave my palms sweaty, and dirty.  Not mention the task of having to take on and off my hot gloves throughout the day to give my hands some air.  It dawned on me that a lot of the grip these gloves provided me were only necessary on the lower digit of my fingers.  In fact I realized a lot of the day to day activities that I would partake in also only really required me to have protection in grip in this specific area.  So utilizing my background in CAD and 3D design I decided to create something that would solve this issue.  Dozens of renderings, 3D printed test models and hand-cast silicone parts later I finally had fully functioning prototypes.</p>

<h3>The Technology</h3>
<p>ViceGrip PRs are made in a durable yet flexible skin-safe silicone. ViceGrip PRs provide a flexible diamond-like pattern that provide protection and tread similar to dragon skin.  As well as being tough they also provide a soft-to-the-touch comfortable texture. </p>

<h3>Gloves vs ViceGrip PRs</h3>
<p>ViceGrip PRs are not meant to be a complete replacement for Gloves. After all gloves whether they be weight lifting, sports related or general activity usage cover more area per square inch on the hands. ViceGrip PRs are meant to strategically target the area of the hands that get a large portion of activity and damage - the lower digits of the fingers. But regardless of what area is covered ViceGrip PRs main advantage are their comfort. Allowing air flow to reach the hands without hot leather, or vinyl material they provide a soft gel-like texture. Produced in high grade silicone they provide better shock absorption making them ideal for high impact areas on the fingers. When worn in the proper sizes ViceGrip PRs provide excellent protection and performance.</p>

<p>ViceGrip PRs can be worn and configured any which way you see fit for the activity you are partaking in. You can wear anywhere from one to 5 ViceGrip PRs on one hand depending how much coverage you want. And because they are flexible they go on comfortably. A testing subject who used ViceGrip PRs to Golf found that one ViceGrip on the index finger helped him maintain a better grip and more shock absorption then a traditional leather glove. A handyman that tested ViceGrip PRs would wear 4 on the hand that he'd use the most to grip his tools and wrenches. It's all up to you where you want extra power.</p>

</div></div>","ViceGrip Performance Rings - Protect, Perform and Grip Tougher!
ViceGrip PRs are ultra-durable silicone rings that act like a second skin for your fingers.  They provide extra grip and protection to your hands without the use of hot and sweaty gloves.  Produced in high-strength silicone these bands provide impact resistance and protection needed to catch a ball more securely, lift weights with less wear, and provide more overall power to your hands.  Using a high friction polygonal texture ViceGrip PRss protect your fingers while providing extra tread to hold on longer, push harder and grip tougher. 


The Perks
Level 1 Perk is only 5$.



Level 2 Perk is only 10$.


Level 3 Perk is only 30$.


Level 4 Perk is only 60$.





The ViceGrip PRs Story

A while back after a long bike ride I noticed that every time I went out for a ride, the gloves I was wearing would leave my palms sweaty, and dirty.  Not mention the task of having to take on and off my hot gloves throughout the day to give my hands some air.  It dawned on me that a lot of the grip these gloves provided me were only necessary on the lower digit of my fingers.  In fact I realized a lot of the day to day activities that I would partake in also only really required me to have protection in grip in this specific area.  So utilizing my background in CAD and 3D design I decided to create something that would solve this issue.  Dozens of renderings, 3D printed test models and hand-cast silicone parts later I finally had fully functioning prototypes.





The Challenge and Solution
My biggest challenge was coming up with an texture and design that wold provide tread and resistance at all angles.  Using a extruded diamond texture I was able to provide that impact resistance tread on the front and back of the rings while allowing finger movement with flat areas on the sides.  


Arthritis and Joint Pain SufferersAs we age our joints become weaker, our grip power  diminishes and in many cases Arthritis develops.  When worn properly sufferers of joint and arthritis pain can can take advantage of the extra grip and protection these rings provide.  Along with providing a supportive and flexible feel ViceGrips can also absorb impact and shock from everyday activities.  ViceGrips aren't a medical device  but they can help prevent pain caused by every day activities on both the young and elderly.


The ViceGrip PRs Advantage



ViceGrip PRss provide the following features and advantages..

Superior grip & tread.
Impact resistance from shock.
Skin Protection from finger wear and tear.
Flexible comfort.
2 Modes - Pinpoint diamond for catching and throwing and wide coverage mode for general grip.
More air circulation and cooling to your hands then wearing gloves.
Non-Slippage inner surface for a secure fit on the fingers.

<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Because it kills 99.9% of all airborne viruses.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ultra-Violet (UV) light is invisible to the human eye and is divided into UVA, UVB and UVC.</p>
<p>UVC is found within 100-280 nm range. In the graph can be seen that germicidal action is maximized at 265 nm with reductions on either side. Iqloo UVC lamps have their main emission at 253,7 nm where the action on DNA is 86% of the peak value and 82% on the IES curve.</p>

<p> As a result, our germicidal lamps are extremely effective in breaking down the DNA of micro-organisms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>This means that they cannot replicate and cause disease.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<i>A concentrated form of UVC is now on the front line in the fight against Covid-19. In China, whole buses are being lit up by the ghostly blue light each  night, while squat, UVC-emitting robots have been cleaning floors in hospitals. Banks have even been using the light to disinfect their money.</i>“ BBC Future</p>

<p>The global response to the looming health workforce crisis in low-income settings has been limited so far. WHO estimates that some 89 million masks and 76 million gloves may be needed in the coming months, and has called on manufacturers of PPE to boost production by 40 percent.</p>
<p>Yet so far shipments of PPE to low-income countries are but a fraction of what’s needed: WHO has so far dispatched 0.5 million PPE sets; UNICEF has dispatched 4.3 million gloves, 100,000 N95 respirators and other PPE; philanthropist Jack Ma is donating 100,000 masks and 1,000 protective suits to each country in Africa, as well as 1.8 million masks to 10 Asian countries. It won’t be nearly enough.<br/>These shortages in protective equipment and materials reflect the situation before the arrival of COVID-19 in any of these low-income countries. An inability to protect healthcare workers will not only lead to needless loss of lives, but also deplete already-stretched health systems. We can’t afford low-income countries to go through an experience like that of Liberia and Sierra Leone during the Ebola epidemic. To effectively fight COVID-19 in low-income countries—and hence globally—the international community needs to step up now to protect frontline health workers.</p>

Why UVC Light?
 
Because it kills 99.9% of all airborne viruses.
 
Ultra-Violet (UV) light is invisible to the human eye and is divided into UVA, UVB and UVC.
UVC is found within 100-280 nm range. In the graph can be seen that germicidal action is maximized at 265 nm with reductions on either side. Iqloo UVC lamps have their main emission at 253,7 nm where the action on DNA is 86% of the peak value and 82% on the IES curve.

 As a result, our germicidal lamps are extremely effective in breaking down the DNA of micro-organisms.
 
This means that they cannot replicate and cause disease.
 
“A concentrated form of UVC is now on the front line in the fight against Covid-19. In China, whole buses are being lit up by the ghostly blue light each  night, while squat, UVC-emitting robots have been cleaning floors in hospitals. Banks have even been using the light to disinfect their money.“ BBC Future

Charity - IQLOO for low income countries
 

 
The global response to the looming health workforce crisis in low-income settings has been limited so far. WHO estimates that some 89 million masks and 76 million gloves may be needed in the coming months, and has called on manufacturers of PPE to boost production by 40 percent.
Yet so far shipments of PPE to low-income countries are but a fraction of what’s needed: WHO has so far dispatched 0.5 million PPE sets; UNICEF has dispatched 4.3 million gloves, 100,000 N95 respirators and other PPE; philanthropist Jack Ma is donating 100,000 masks and 1,000 protective suits to each country in Africa, as well as 1.8 million masks to 10 Asian countries. It won’t be nearly enough.These shortages in protective equipment and materials reflect the situation before the arrival of COVID-19 in any of these low-income countries. An inability to protect healthcare workers will not only lead to needless loss of lives, but also deplete already-stretched health systems. We can’t afford low-income countries to go through an experience like that of Liberia and Sierra Leone during the Ebola epidemic. To effectively fight COVID-19 in low-income countries—and hence globally—the international community needs to step up now to protect frontline health workers.
IQLOO, as a company and part of the community, couldn’t just ignore this situation, and decided to take action immediately. 
We created specific perks to support low-income countries and provide them IQLOO UVC Mask Sanitazers in order to quickly respond to the lack of masks and PPE.
We ask you to take part to this campaign and do your best to provide your help to the countries and people that really need it. IQLOO cooperates with few charity organizations and will take care of shipping all the UVC Mask Sanitizers to the countries that need them, from Africa to Asia and Latin America.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> My name is Lewis Hawkins I am currently undertaking a masters degree in Sport and Exercise Psychology and soon to be doing a PhD in the same field. I work as a non-emergency ambulance care assistant in which I have seen all walks of life and the long-term consequence of specific behaviours. It is with these two factors in mind that Militant Fitness was created. </p>
<p>The term 'Militant' defined as - 'vigorously active and aggressive, especially in support of a cause'</p>
<p>This is important to the philosophy of this company, as this is an unconventional style of fitness coaching that we believe is the correct method based on the latest field of research. With an ever growing era of fitness technology and 'six pack abs in 10 minutes!' programmes it is hard to separate the legitimate from the money grabbing. From my experiences from working on the ambulances, I have seen the crippling realities of training incorrectly. For example, I have witness ex-professional athletes riddled with joint problems and nutritional deficits, and a crippling anxiety from the pressures of competing without proper guidance.  </p>
<p>Militant Fitness vows to steer away from 'Bro-science' and ensure an honest training programme designed <strong><u>only</u></strong> through documented and proven training methods. The implications of this project, I believe, could be vast. The content is out there to prove there is a new way of becoming fit that will work not only for your body but also for your mind. </p>

<p>Today, we offer mobile personal training and online advice to deliver our service. However, we are missing a venue to really prescribe our service appropriately. I am looking for £5,000 to allow for a couple months rent of an industrial unit and equipment to allow ourselves enough turnover time to achieve appropriate cash flow. </p>
<p>With this unit, we will be investing into the latest fitness (and Fitness Technology) equipment to offer our clients, truly, a service unlike any other. This will allow for a premium service to be achieved to objectively earn the clients trust that we do sincerely care about their progression. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It is difficult to foresee the impact of this project as it is unlike any other. Adopting various styles of training (Functionality, Calisthenics, hypertrophy and Flexibility) into one. The last time a similar unique programme was introduced was Crossfit in which exploded beyond control.  It is understandably far fetched to assumed a breadth as wide as CrossFit, however, if we can even reach a fraction of the popularity of CrossFit then this project will be a huge success. </p>
<p>This project has a great deal of importance. We are far to educated as a society to allow improper training to occur, encouraging life changing injuries and implications. Our militant programmes aim to educate clients to not bottle feed off everything they read on the internet (Fake News) and use their critical eye to understand what is right for themselves. </p>
<p>Our programmes are already designed and we are itching to start, however, we need your help. Any contribution will be massively helpful, and as a thank you we promise to ensure the most thoughtful efficient training we could possible offer. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any business venture, there is always a risk. This is something our team are very aware of. However, we all volunteer and have been contributing to this service without pay for over two years and are determined to prevail. </p>
<p>Fortunately, due to the nature of fitness, body maintenance is a task that every single person needs to adhere to. With this in mind, finding clients is not predicted to be our biggest hurdle. The biggest challenge we predict to have as a company is the exclusivity of the training.

<h3>""You won't find many better trail bikes for this kind of cash."" - MBUK magazine, November 2020 edition.</h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Origin..</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Steve and I have been an avid mountain biker for over 25 years.  Over the last 10 years I have worked for 3 different direct to consumer bike brands, learning everything I needed to create my own brand. Having seen how much a bike actually costs from the factories, I realised that there was room to make an even higher spec price for a great price. How? By removing the costs that even direct to consumer brands have, such as a warehouse and its staff, an office and its staff and so on... That's where crowdfunding comes in!</p>
<p>I have spent the last couple of years finding a great factory that can build the bikes, designing the bike and and the spec, and honing it until I felt I had a really fun, fast bike that won't break the bank. I wanted to create a bike that was ready to use 'out of the box', so common items that are quickly changed on a new bike (such as good tyres and dropper post) were a must.</p>
<p>In order to be able to get this bike, we need a minimum order of 300, so that's where this crowd funding campaign comes in! When you buy this bike, you'll be getting it in the knowledge that someone with a lot of passion has put their heart and soul into bringing it to life. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As I said, we need to reach a minimum order of 300 bikes to be able to get them. If we don't reach that goal after 60 days, you will get your money back. If we do reach the goal, we will immediately order the bikes. </p>
<h3>The Bike:</h3>
<p>The Tornado Attack has been designed as a fun and fast all mountain/trail bike for the best price possible.</p>
<p>It has all of the latest mountain bike design features such as Boost spacing, a long and slack frame, a low standover height and a short, wide cockpit.</p>
<p>150mm of RockShox Recon RL front travel and Monarch R rear offers a plush ride, and the 11 speed Shimano SLX M7000 with 11-46 gearing gives you a great range for up or down hill.</p>
<p>The internally routed dropper post with 150mm of travel makes it easy to go from ascending to descending at the flick of a switch, and the tubeless ready Maxxis High Roller II tyres, with 3C on the front, offer great traction.</p>

Our consensus of State College can be described by one word: serendipitous.  Also recently, I have discovered the wonderful world of professional waxing.  I fell in love with an exclusive waxing studio, and have been bitten by an entrepreneurial bug.  I am compelled to share my experiences with the residents (and visitors) of State College, PA.  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Your help will enable me to open a unique salon exclusive to waxing.  We will redefine the waxing experience with quality which you would expect in a big city, but served with small town charm.  Additionally, you will help create up to 10 employment opportunities!
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get  </b>The projected expenses for this start-up endeavor is approx. 96K.  I am asking 69K to help me get started. Those who are not familiar with crowdfunding, there is about 10% of online administrative fees which will be deducted from raised funds.  <br/></p>
<p>Your money will be fully refunded, if I do not meet this goal...and there will be no studio, because crowdfunding is also a test of market demand.  Here is a chance for you to let me know that you can use my service. <br/></p>
<p>The breakdown of expenses are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Studio build-outs 40k</li>
<li>Furniture &amp; Equipment 15K  </li>
<li>Supply 4K</li>
<li>First year rent and utilities  26K</li>
<li>Legal fees (attorney and insurance) 5K</li>

<p>As a ‘thank you’, I’m offering unique perks which are creative and functional. Some perks may not make sense unless you've seen the short film.  Check them out and let me know if you have any questions!</p>
<p>Every contribution helps, no matter how small! Even if you can only contribute one dollar, do know that you will be making a difference with helping me succeed. All contributions, regardless of the amount, are greatly appreciated.<br/></p>

<p><b>The Impact </b>People around town have expressed strong feelings about the need for a beauty salon, exclusive to waxing!  I know there’s a growing trend in waxing among students.  It’s a lifestyle change for this generation.  Waxing improves one’s appearance thereby increasing self-esteem resulting in a more positive outlook on life.  When it comes to facial and body hair, less is definitely more!</p>
<p>This 
will be the ultimate place you’ll come for hair removal, where our goal 
is to provide care with top performance: friendly, professional, quick, 
yet effective, and with competitive pricing.  Our studio policy includes no double dipping, and no tipping! <br/></p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b> I have no salon background in terms of operating one, only as a client.  And as a client, I have very high standards for a waxing service, and I would like to provide that same standard to my own clients.  Additionally, I have over ten years of customer service experience in the food service industry.  I’m determined to succeed: I have done my research and found support 
needed to make this work.  I believe in myself: this is the first time 
in my life where my mind, my
 heart, and my gut instincts are all speaking with one voice: let’s wax
 this city! <br/></p>

<p>I’m approaching this business from a different angle: a designer’s angle, if you 
will.  The business model begins from the user end.  We’ll make our best efforts to be Eco-friendly from the design of the 
studio to product selection and all the way through to execution.  But 
great product alone isn’t good enough.  We’ll couple that with 
exceptional technical skills.  This means, our entire team will need to 
be trained to meet highest standards of quality.<br/></p>
<p>As a multidisciplinary designer, all my years of various design experiences will come together for the studio.  My interior and exhibit design background will result in the stunning look of our studio and contribute to an enhanced customer experience.   I will  take lead in every aspect of the brand, and operate as the studio manager.  I feel like I’ve been in the business of aesthetics since birth.  I’ve designed <i>for</i> people all my life, now I bring design <i>to</i> the people.</p>

meaningful insights I discovered throughout years of intensive laboratory
research is that biology cannot be confined. This is why well trained doctors
tend to be very careful about giving patients their prognosis, as they have
learned to appreciate the tremendous capacities basic human physiology has.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: #9F6303;"">In the past few years
I dedicated most of my research to the area of fertility and fertility
treatments. This research and development process has led to two major breakthroughs:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style=""color: #9F6303;"">Development of
     two remarkable medical devices (together with a team of engineers and
     doctors) 
 </span></li>
<li><span><span style=""color: #9F6303;"">Accumulation of
     substantial scientific knowledge regarding fertility into practical advice.
</span></span></li>
</ol>
<span><span style=""color: #9F6303;"">One of the things I discovered
is that many people who believe they are infertile or suffering from fertility
problems are actually capable of generating the next generation, without
visiting fertility clinics and paying great amounts of money for fertility
treatments. Others may dramatically reduce their dependence on the medical
system. The remaining individuals will need to rely on the assistance of the
most updated medical techniques.</span></span><div>

</div></div>","Hello everybody,
Have you ever stood in front of a medical
situation and felt helpless?Fertility
issues are some of the most frustrating situations a couple or a person can
face. What people are less aware of is that the human body is capable of
regenerating normal or at least healthier fertility capacities.
These claims are based on vast
scientific-academic research.About Me
My name is Dr. Assaf Cohen
and I am from Israel.
I did my first research
(MSc) in immunology and my PhD in microbiology.
Today I lecture at the Hebrew
University of Jerusalem and work privately as a scientist.What is This Project All
About?
This campaign is about
funding the publishing of a scientific textbook aimed at improving or
completely solving fertility issues.
One of the most
meaningful insights I discovered throughout years of intensive laboratory
research is that biology cannot be confined. This is why well trained doctors
tend to be very careful about giving patients their prognosis, as they have
learned to appreciate the tremendous capacities basic human physiology has.
In the past few years
I dedicated most of my research to the area of fertility and fertility
treatments. This research and development process has led to two major breakthroughs:

Development of
     two remarkable medical devices (together with a team of engineers and
     doctors) 
 
Accumulation of
     substantial scientific knowledge regarding fertility into practical advice.


One of the things I discovered
is that many people who believe they are infertile or suffering from fertility
problems are actually capable of generating the next generation, without
visiting fertility clinics and paying great amounts of money for fertility
treatments. Others may dramatically reduce their dependence on the medical
system. The remaining individuals will need to rely on the assistance of the
most updated medical techniques.


People ask questions,
read information on websites and hear things from others. What I want to do
through this book is filter out rumors and inaccurate data (which exists for
irrelevant reasons such as generating a profit) and gather reliable scientific
data, along with years of experience, into one book. There is a lot of
surprising knowledge and there are many opinions to share. Fertility is
actually in our own hands far more than we would imagine.


Regardless of which
fertility issue you suffer from or whether doctors are unable to define the
cause of the infertility, this book can be beneficial to you. This book is
meant for both men and women and it focuses mainly on the practical side of
curing infertility.





Insights About the Book




Many interesting facts and ideas about and from the book are elaborated upon in the update section of this campaign. Each update details a different aspect of the book; collectively they form a valuable tool to aid in understanding the structure and special benefits of the final product.

What is the $9400
actually required for?
Aside from writing,
publishing a book is also about:
Editing- writing in proper English is not enough. The
English should be well polished.




Graphic Design- in order to add an aesthetic appeal to this textbook.






Printing- we aim for quality digital printing of at
least 1000 copies of the book.


A Website- in which future editions can be sold
worldwide, and in multiple languages.



Altogether, it adds up
to $9400.
In any case, your credit card/ PayPal account will be charged only in the event that this campaign reaches its funding goal.

Aid is on Its Way
It is no secret that
couples all over the globe face fertility issues. The World Health Organization
(WHO) estimates the number of people today suffering from impaired fertility at
about 50,000,000 and unfortunately, the numbers keep increasing with each
passing year.



The good news is that
many (!) of these people can help themselves out of this difficult condition.
If you are looking for
a professional, yet practical scientific book collecting data from numerous
scientific articles and loaded with years of practical lab work, this is it.



True Appreciation
Starting from the
“THANK YOU!” letter, I will also be sending the book, the book plus my personal
acknowledgement, or the book with your name on one of the opening pages of the
first edition (along with the rest of the perks…).






The Bottom Line
Don’t give in
automatically to routine treatments.
A person is not sick
until he or she defines himself/herself as such.
There is so much to do
“MUCH BEFORE THE
SYRINGE”.


Here is a video showing some personal aspects I thought might be worth sharing:

<p><b>The most important factor in skin care is moisture!</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Skin that is
moisture-deficient is more vulnerable to environmental irritants which can form
an excess of dead skin cells. Unhealthy skin will turn dull, flaky and rough.
Therefore, a daily moisturizing routine is strongly encouraged by all
dermatologists. </p>
<p>SFIT reads skin
moisture levels through Bio-Impedance measurement technology, which can
analyze water and oil content of skin by measuring the flow of a micro
current through skin tissue. Bio-impedance is a well established
methodology for estimating body composition in particular muscle mass and body
fat. This is done by running a current through the hands across the entire body
and measuring the impedance the current faces while running through body
tissue. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The SFIT is
designed to take a moisture level reading of only the</span><i style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> stratum corneum</i><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> (the

the layer of the epidermis most closely associated with moisture retention and
the prevention of irritants, making it the ideal layer to test for dry skin. By
running a mico ampere current through this isolated area of the body,
accuracy of the moisture level readings are greatly enhanced. </span></p>
<p>
By providing precise measurements of the moisture levels of your skin, SFIT
provides real-time feedback on whether you need to hydrate or moisturize. Also,
in coordination with the tanning application, the SFIT tells you whether your
skin is in the proper condition to go tanning. </p>

<p><i><b>What are the potential dangers of high UV exposure?</b></i></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Even a few minutes of exposure to excessively high UV rays can cause direct and immediate damage to your skin. The most common symptoms of excessive UV
exposure are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Dryness - as the outer layers thicken to
protect you from the sun's UV rays, the skin continuously loses moisture.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Blemishes - blotchy discoloration from the breakage of small blood vessels can
be an early sign of sun damage.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Aging - UV damages the Elastin and
collagen fibers in the lower layers of the skin causing
loss of the skin's natural elasticity. Less elasticity in the skin creates wrinkles, which if widespread, gives the appearance of skin aging.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<div>For people with chronic dry skin, excessive tanning is often the main culprit of skin aging which shows up in unsightly wrinkles, saggy skin, and spots. Even when this dryness isn't apparent or painful, like with a sunburn, it can have unwanted long-term effects on skin health. <span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">SFIT's UV sensor is your companion to avoiding potentially damaging daily UV exposure. At high-alert UV levels SFIT will alert you so that you can take the proper precautions. Whether it be avoiding going outdoors or what you should wear when heading out SFIT will be your guide to good skin health. Not only for over-exposure, SFIT will also suggest that you go outside and take in some sunshine if you've been cooped up indoors for too long. </span></div>

</div></div>","Everyone aspires to live a healthy lifestyle but in our hectic modern times it can be darn near impossible to practice well-being. SFIT, the most comprehensive wellness smart device, is here to help!








The first part to a healthy lifestyle is exercise and SFIT helps to keep you on-track with your daily/weekly/monthly exercise routine. SFIT doesn't just manage your fitness, but also acts as your personal skincare advisor. Fitted with both a UV and skin-moisture sensor, SFIT gives you instant feedback to supplement your daily personal skincare program. This technology has also been integrated into a smart tanning program so that you can work towards both a fit body and also healthy glowing skin. All in one tiny compact device, SFIT will keep you health conscious helping you find a more active and healthy YOU!  
For matters of health & wellness, leave it to SFIT.  Start getting healthy and start getting out more with the SFIT by your side!























The most important factor in skin care is moisture!

Skin that is
moisture-deficient is more vulnerable to environmental irritants which can form
an excess of dead skin cells. Unhealthy skin will turn dull, flaky and rough.
Therefore, a daily moisturizing routine is strongly encouraged by all
dermatologists. 
SFIT reads skin
moisture levels through Bio-Impedance measurement technology, which can
analyze water and oil content of skin by measuring the flow of a micro
current through skin tissue. Bio-impedance is a well established
methodology for estimating body composition in particular muscle mass and body
fat. This is done by running a current through the hands across the entire body
and measuring the impedance the current faces while running through body
tissue. 
The SFIT is
designed to take a moisture level reading of only the stratum corneum (the
outer-most layer of skin). The stratum corneum is
the layer of the epidermis most closely associated with moisture retention and
the prevention of irritants, making it the ideal layer to test for dry skin. By
running a mico ampere current through this isolated area of the body,
accuracy of the moisture level readings are greatly enhanced. 

By providing precise measurements of the moisture levels of your skin, SFIT
provides real-time feedback on whether you need to hydrate or moisturize. Also,
in coordination with the tanning application, the SFIT tells you whether your
skin is in the proper condition to go tanning. 






What are the potential dangers of high UV exposure?
Even a few minutes of exposure to excessively high UV rays can cause direct and immediate damage to your skin. The most common symptoms of excessive UV
exposure are:


Dryness - as the outer layers thicken to
protect you from the sun's UV rays, the skin continuously loses moisture.


Blemishes - blotchy discoloration from the breakage of small blood vessels can
be an early sign of sun damage.


Aging - UV damages the Elastin and
collagen fibers in the lower layers of the skin causing
loss of the skin's natural elasticity. Less elasticity in the skin creates wrinkles, which if widespread, gives the appearance of skin aging.


For people with chronic dry skin, excessive tanning is often the main culprit of skin aging which shows up in unsightly wrinkles, saggy skin, and spots. Even when this dryness isn't apparent or painful, like with a sunburn, it can have unwanted long-term effects on skin health.  

SFIT's UV sensor is your companion to avoiding potentially damaging daily UV exposure. At high-alert UV levels SFIT will alert you so that you can take the proper precautions. Whether it be avoiding going outdoors or what you should wear when heading out SFIT will be your guide to good skin health. Not only for over-exposure, SFIT will also suggest that you go outside and take in some sunshine if you've been cooped up indoors for too long. 


                                         










How can I continue tanning without exposing myself to health risks?




SFIT ensures proper tanning by first checking whether UV levels are safe and then by analyzing whether your skin is in a healthy enough condition to tan. After you confirm that it's safe to tan, you can set the smart tanning timer which will guide you in achieving your desired skin tone.
 SFIT's tanning timer is not just a timer, the time you need to reach your desired tan is calibrated to shorten or lengthen based on varying UV levels.  In 7 simple steps all tanning precautions will be covered so you can tan without worrying about risk of skin damage. 

What are some of the problems associated with improper tanning?
In modern times, more and more people have found the joy of tanning. A tanned skin-tone is often associated with good health and an active lifestyle. However, while exposure to sunlight has numerous benefits, improper tanning including excessive use of tanning beds has caused cases of skin damage to skyrocket. Sunburn, a reddening of the skin caused by overexposure to the sun’s harmful
ultraviolet (UV) radiation may just seem like temporary
irritation, but sunburns can cause long-lasting damage to the skin. Direct exposure to high-levels of UV rays can cause direct damage to the skin's cells preventing moisture retention and creating a higher risk of bacterial infection. 


Children are especially at risk: One
blistering sunburn in childhood or adolescence can more than double a person's chances of developing
melanoma later in life.

We know it is important to use her time wisely, look for new experiences, and focus on joy.  In that spirit, since we are pretty sure that there's no way to get tickets to Hamilton (sigh!), I am hoping to give Katja the chance to go on her dream trip to Africa.  She went once on a student exchange in middle school and has always talked about going back to see the amazing animals and landscape again.  However, I need help to make this bucket list trip a reality for her.  I hope it will give her a chance to take some time to live in the moment again.  I know this is a lot to ask of the internet universe, but I figure it is worth a shot.  If there is anyone who would like to help us reach our goal, we really cannot tell you how much it would mean!",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Who I am</h3>
<p>Let me introduce myself first. My name is Ezequiel Lukinskas and I am Biogenica’s CEO (one of the two main organizations that work in this project, each one with an executive and technical counterpart) as well as a pharmaceutical chemistry student. In the past months I have been trying to get loans from different banks to start this but they all said it was too big of a project for us to achieve and that only big pharmaceutical companies carry on drug development. That is why I bring to you, the people, this project, bypassing all the banks that are only interested in money in short term and anyone that tries to tell us what to do and what not to do. Now, I have this dream in which one day no one will have to die from cancer and I believe that if we stand together we can achieve anything and everything we can dream of.</p>
<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>We are a team of chemists, medics and executives willing to undertake a mega-project to try and find a solution to what is now the worst ailment of our time and one of the main causes of death in the whole world*.</p>
<p>Because of this we got together with the best scientists of the country and got on board this project with the Faculty of Chemistry of Uruguay’s State University by means of Pando Science and Technology Park and Pando Technological Pole which is the department of the Faculty of Chemistry by which it makes extension (“university extension”, in this context means making projects that are either from public-private participation or collaboration between a university and other organizations). This makes our “base” in Uruguay but as this project’s implications are of global scale we are not discarding the idea of future collaboration from scientists and organizations from all over the world.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Why we are doing this</h3>
<p>We have a team of scientists ready to take the challenge and we have the knowledge that 10 years of investigation have given us but we still need the initial funds to have our own lab space and to start working in the first studies of this stage of the investigation. We have already narrowed the number of substances which we will be working with and identified probably the main substance that will work as active principle so we are actually really close and it’s because of this that we know we will succeed.</p>
<p>But none of this would be possible without your help and this is why we are asking you to be part of this project.</p>

<h3>Here is how it works</h3>
<p>The approach we are taking with this medicament is essentially different from all other treatments used so far. The way by which the main compound acts against tumors is by stimulating apoptosis (programmed cell death) in tumor cells while leaving healthy cells unaffected.</p>
<p>We also tackle the problem of immunity and cancer: Traditional Chemotherapy and radiotherapy destroy cancer cells, but also destroy healthy cells and bring down the body defenses. The real problem there lies in that when you destroy cells their remains later, if not removed completely, will decompose causing infections that are as much a threat as traditional therapy’s direct damage where as in programmed cell death the remains are recycled and the space filled with new healthy cells. Here we have to remember that tumors are not an external threat that invades our body like a virus or bacteria that needs to be eradicated. Instead we have to realize it is a part of our own body that is “malfunctioning” and needs to be fixed, if possible healed. Now the approach we are taking is different to traditional approaches not only because we are using a substance that will induce most cancer cells to a normal, harmless death, and even change cancer cells that are young or in process of turning cancerous, back to normal healthy cells, but because we also focus in enhancing the immune system so that the body itself can help more efficiently in the tumor eradication. This is why we believe we have found something very close to “the perfect homeostatic regulator”, something that has been sought actively since decades (somewhat like a holy grail in cancer drug development).</p>

<p> </p>
<p>A lot of the pain and suffering from cancer is a result of necrotic tumours. Cancer cells disable apoptosis via a mutation and this helps fuel their endless proliferation. This makes the normal apoptotic signals useless and although lymphocytes can still trigger apoptosis by reaching the tumor cell, this stresses the immune system and generally is not enough to fight cancer as tumors grow faster than what lymphocytes can deal with. That being said, switching back on apoptosis in tumor cells is at the forefront of cancer therapy.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>ProBalance Vitamins grew out of our concern for our clients and patients.  They came into our office looking for help with nutrition and health.  The majority were taking at least one prescription medication.  In some cases up to 15 different medications.  We knew that these patients relied on these life saving drugs as they aged, but we also knew that pushing the body in one way leaves an imbalance somewhere else.</p>
<p>Digging into the available scientific literature led us to the term Drug Induced Nutritional Deficiency.  Studies of prescription medication have demonstrated that deficiencies may be created by the use of common drugs (e.g. – statins). Other vitamin companies have offered a hodge-podge of supplements designed for certain organs or body systems that have had mixed results.</p>
<p>With so many people relying on the medications for their lives, we designed a vitamin to address the deficiency. This Initial Offering will target the affects of blood pressure and cholesterol medications. We will also offer a supplement to aid in reduction in male hormones brought on by age and other environmental factors.  </p>
<p>Our company offers a single bottle formula to address the possible problem of Prescription Drug Induced Nutritional Deficiency. These supplements will contain doses to balance the potential effects of the medications on the body. We designed ProBalance Vitamins for the way you live your life! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Why We Need Your Support</strong></h3>
<p>Over the past year we have developed and tested variations on several different formulas. The vitamin works with quality ingredients in the correct amounts.  <i>We are confident that this First Formula - Cardio Complete BP/CH will support those people afflicted  with these common conditions.</i>  </p>
<p><i>Our Second Formulation - Complete Male Hi-Test supplements natural hormone balance in the aging male.  It works to support optimal vitality; cardiovascular, mental and blood sugar systems.  </i>The next step involves getting this Vitamin manufactured and in the hands of people who need them.</p>
<p>ProBalance Vitamins are going to be manufactured in an facility that is registered with the FDA. This certified manufacturer uses top-of-the-line equipment and ingredients. This is why we need your help. The initial manufacturing step will cost $22,000. Once this step is completed, we need the additional money to augment our online presence, update ordering software, and create brand awareness for our specialized niche in the crowded Nutritional Supplement market.  Lastly, we can then create a sustainable line of Formulas to address a variety of deficiencies derived from the interaction of the human body and the prescription medication, from Cardio Health to Pancreatic Health to most body systems.</p>

<h3>What This Means </h3>
<p>You can participate in bringing this needed vitamin to market and, at the same time, help yourself or others.  Our First Formula is designed for those taking a Blood Pressure and/or Cholesterol Medications.  Since these drugs are the most prescribed, you must know someone who could benefit from the ProBalance Vitamins.  </p>
<p>The <i>Complete Male HiTest</i> uses herbs and nutraceuticals to provided support without stopping your body's natural production of hormones while enncouraging a younger, more robust metabolism.</p>
<p>We want to help people live fuller lives without suffering the affects of side effects.  But we need your help to get there.</p>
<p>However, if we fail to reach our goal, the funds will be returned.  No vitamins will be delivered.  And the presence of Drug Induced Nutritional Deficiencies will continue.  Please help us to help others live the type of life they want to live.</p>

<p>The market for supplements has grown exponentially. Current sales have topped over $70 Billion.  The saturated vitamin sector creates a problem needing a solution.  We believe we have that answer.  </p>
<p>We have found a niche that no other vitamin company has tackled.  Other companies have thrown weak supplements without sufficient active ingredients to move the body most effectively out of the Drug Induced Nutritional Deficiency.  With our ProBalance Medinutrient Vitamins, we believe we will dominate our corner of the market.  We can only do it with your help.  Your support could give a different life to someone close to you taking these medications.</p>

This affordable device is packed with features including USB charging, LED light, ringer and a free iPhone and Android App. Forget about buying batteries, instead charge every 3 months and you are set.</p>
<p>The Blink project started when two guys, one in USA and the other in Thailand came up with a similar idea on the same day. Inspiration struck when one accidentally left his phone in his pants and put them in washer (for about 10th time) while the other was worried about his kids safety in a crowded mall.</p>
<p>After researching what was currently available in the market place and what other trackers are missing, we decided to produce Blink, a device that is  slim <b>(0.13 in / 3.5 mm thickness), <b>rechargeable (comes with USB charger),</b></b> <b>affordable</b>, <b>attractive</b> and <b>water resistant. </b>Our <b>iOS</b> and <b>Android</b> Apps are <b>easy to use</b> with features that meets even the most discerning user's expectations.</p>
<p>Now with Blink, finding keys is as easy as counting 1, 2, 3....Let it Ring! Let it Ring! Let it Ring!, with our <b>Buzzer + LED feature</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>

<br/>
<p>The advantages don't stop here.</p>
<p>1. Have your kids wear Blink as a pendant or a bracelet. Now when you are in a crowded mall, a village fair, or in Disneyland, let Blink notify you with our <b>separation notification feature </b>when your loved ones are lost.</p>
<p>2. Concerned about losing your puppy or a cat? Tag them with Blink and now you are worry free. See if they are closing in on you with our <b>approaching notification feature</b></p>
<p>3. Place Blink in your laundry room or attach it to your TV remote and let Blink notify you that your phone is about to get washed or your TV remote is hiding under the couch.<br/></p>
<p>4. Taking care of an elderly family member? Have them wear it and  never lose a sight of them with our <b>proximity indicator feature</b>.</p>

<p></p>
<p>With 30 years of combined experience in technology field and Master's degree in Computer Science we make a team that is passionate about this idea and are very close to make it a reality. With our prototype for device in the final phase, we are ready to design our app for mobile devices but we need help to make our dream a reality. With your contribution we will be able to finalize how the final Blink will look. Not just in appearance, because our experience has taught us no matter how beautiful the product the underlying technology has to be solid. With funds from this campaign we will improve the app design, fine tune the antenna, optimize power usage and enhance the ringer sound. Some portion of your contribution will go towards getting certifications from FCC, CE and Bluetooth as well as on our package design that will make our unique product complete.</p>

</div><br/></div>","The thinnest rechargeable tracking device The Blink is the thinnest rechargeable tracking device available on the market. This affordable device is packed with features including USB charging, LED light, ringer and a free iPhone and Android App. Forget about buying batteries, instead charge every 3 months and you are set.
The Blink project started when two guys, one in USA and the other in Thailand came up with a similar idea on the same day. Inspiration struck when one accidentally left his phone in his pants and put them in washer (for about 10th time) while the other was worried about his kids safety in a crowded mall.
After researching what was currently available in the market place and what other trackers are missing, we decided to produce Blink, a device that is  slim (0.13 in / 3.5 mm thickness), rechargeable (comes with USB charger), affordable, attractive and water resistant. Our iOS and Android Apps are easy to use with features that meets even the most discerning user's expectations.
Now with Blink, finding keys is as easy as counting 1, 2, 3....Let it Ring! Let it Ring! Let it Ring!, with our Buzzer + LED feature




Not able to locate your phone, Blink is here to help....with our locate your phone feature






Ask other Blinkers to locate your stuff with our crowd lost and found network






With Blink's metallic silver finish and edges surrounded by LEDs gives this thinnest device a beautiful look.  

The advantages don't stop here.
1. Have your kids wear Blink as a pendant or a bracelet. Now when you are in a crowded mall, a village fair, or in Disneyland, let Blink notify you with our separation notification feature when your loved ones are lost.
2. Concerned about losing your puppy or a cat? Tag them with Blink and now you are worry free. See if they are closing in on you with our approaching notification feature
3. Place Blink in your laundry room or attach it to your TV remote and let Blink notify you that your phone is about to get washed or your TV remote is hiding under the couch.
4. Taking care of an elderly family member? Have them wear it and  never lose a sight of them with our proximity indicator feature.




 Use of Funds

With 30 years of combined experience in technology field and Master's degree in Computer Science we make a team that is passionate about this idea and are very close to make it a reality. With our prototype for device in the final phase, we are ready to design our app for mobile devices but we need help to make our dream a reality. With your contribution we will be able to finalize how the final Blink will look. Not just in appearance, because our experience has taught us no matter how beautiful the product the underlying technology has to be solid. With funds from this campaign we will improve the app design, fine tune the antenna, optimize power usage and enhance the ringer sound. Some portion of your contribution will go towards getting certifications from FCC, CE and Bluetooth as well as on our package design that will make our unique product complete.

<p>Sleep is a core component of our health. One of the major factors that impacts sleep quality is snoring. Besides being annoying and embarrassing, snoring increases many health related risks by reducing oxygen intake.</p>
<p>Ackek's patented design does more than just recording movements, such as tossing and turning during sleep. Our technology is capable of detecting snore as well as determining who is snoring in a room and also monitors many other vital signs. Once snoring is detected and the overall sleep quality decreases to a critical level, Actrek generates a gentle stimulus to alert you and restore your sleep back to normal.</p>
<p></p>

<p>After you fall asleep, Actrek snore management system automatically starts to monitor your heart rate, respiration, oxygen level, body temperature and movement. The results will be sent to your mobile phone which will also detect the snoring sound. The Actrek's sleep management app will evaluate your overall sleep quality based on the measured data. This monitoring process works in the background continuously until you wake up in the morning.  </p>

<p>Heart rate is one of the most important vital signs. During an exercise, the heart rate could go up to more than 100 beats per minute so that knowing the accurate results is very important. Actrek enables you to track your heart rate through both optical and electrical means.</p>
<p>Optical heart rate monitoring works reasonably well during normal daily activities while it may give misleading readings during intensive workout.</p>
<p>To overcome the problem, Actrek adds electrical heart rate monitoring capability which works much more accurately in both causal and extensive use cases.</p>

""Actrek is one of the most ambitious wearable we've seen. If the team can pull it off I reckon some of the big names will be looking over their shoulders at Actrek which blows most of them away in terms of features.. It's also better looking than the average fitness tracker."" - Urbanwearables Technology
""Of course, this is not the first smartwatch that presents itself as a true rival to a fitness tracker, most major companies offer something similar (Samsung Gear S2, Motorola Moto 360 Sport, and Apple Watch for example). However, Actrek’s effort is hoping to become the definitive example, boasting an array of features that cover the broadest possible functionality"" - What Wearable Tech


At Entanti we believe that a holistic approach is the best path for realizing true health and fitness improvements: 

Be Active
Eat Right
Sleep Well

Actrek’s 50+ features are powered with patented sensors technologies and sophisticated algorithms. Choose your favorite sports, set your own fitness goals, track your progress, adjust your lifestyle and motivate yourself to live a healthier life.








Achieving better fitness requires adequate exercise, eating properly and good sleep. Actrek Smart Fitness System can help by providing comprehensive tracking, analyzing and guiding capabilities to lead you to achieve your fitness goals effectively and efficiently. Actrek monitors your daily activities including your activity level, your nutritional patterns and your sleep quality. Using your present fitness condition and your goals, Actrek’s Smart Fitness algorithm will find the relationship between your behaviors and your overall fitness scores. Once the correlation is established, Actrek’s Smart Fitness algorithm will provide you reports of how well you are doing and suggestions of how to do them better.

Sleep is a core component of our health. One of the major factors that impacts sleep quality is snoring. Besides being annoying and embarrassing, snoring increases many health related risks by reducing oxygen intake.
Ackek's patented design does more than just recording movements, such as tossing and turning during sleep. Our technology is capable of detecting snore as well as determining who is snoring in a room and also monitors many other vital signs. Once snoring is detected and the overall sleep quality decreases to a critical level, Actrek generates a gentle stimulus to alert you and restore your sleep back to normal.


After you fall asleep, Actrek snore management system automatically starts to monitor your heart rate, respiration, oxygen level, body temperature and movement. The results will be sent to your mobile phone which will also detect the snoring sound. The Actrek's sleep management app will evaluate your overall sleep quality based on the measured data. This monitoring process works in the background continuously until you wake up in the morning.  





You’re in total control of over 50+ features available that let you customize your experience. Simply choose your favorite exercises and sports on your mobile device and you’re ready to go. Once you’ve finished your exercise, Actrek gives you informative feedback to improve your next workout.









Heart rate is one of the most important vital signs. During an exercise, the heart rate could go up to more than 100 beats per minute so that knowing the accurate results is very important. Actrek enables you to track your heart rate through both optical and electrical means.
Optical heart rate monitoring works reasonably well during normal daily activities while it may give misleading readings during intensive workout.
To overcome the problem, Actrek adds electrical heart rate monitoring capability which works much more accurately in both causal and extensive use cases.




With Actrek, you can manage your exercise to achieve your fitness goal much more effectively.



Flexibility and respiration are something you need to take care.
Do your body and mind a favor, keep yourself hydrated.


During competition, Actrek provides you real time and meaningful feedback to help you improve your performance.

Even as a casual user, you can still know your fitness status including body composition, flexibility, hydration, activity levels and follow Actrek feedback and guidance to improve your health. 


Balanced nutrition is essential to your health and fitness, whether you're in a weight watching program or just trying to eat healthier. Actrek lets you generate barcodes for easy storing and sharing of your home-made recipes. Making it easier for you to know what you ate and what you need to eat.





You can access Actrek nutrition database to get detailed nutrition facts for all kinds of food. Use Actrek Food Tracking System to generate a barcode for the food you normally have and scan them in next time you eat so that you don't have to type in the nutrition facts every time. Using Actrek Smart Fitness System to track your fitness progress and athletic performance in comparison with your nutrition history, you will know why and how you can improve your overall fitness effectively.







Set your goals, keep an eye on your health and fitness improvement, share your tips with your friends, team up with your friends and compete with others. Never miss any important messages, calls and events with Actrek’s notification capability. Enjoy what you love with those that are important to you with Actrek Cloud and Social Network platform. 

Other consumer electronic products available today have taken advantage of the rapid advance in wireless and sensor technologies. Meanwhile the health and fitness wearable segment of the market is lagging behind. At Entanti we believe that we have a great opportunity to integrate these technologies and to develop new products like Actrek that will revolutionize the health and fitness experience.


From the beginning of this project to now, Actrek has evolved from good to better to awesome, and now we present you the awesome Actrek:









Actrek integrates the latest sensor technologies to deliver the comprehensive and meaningful feedback. The sensors are either physical or biometrical and our
advanced signal processing algorithm powered by the ARM
microprocessor produces highly accurate measurements and intensive analysis






Actrek Notification provides Caller IDs, text messaging, and calendar event alerts which allows you a hands-free operation so that you never miss anything important.
Music Control lets you enjoy your workout without the hassle of having to use your phone.

Wireless Charging is easy and convenient. Drop Actrek in the cradle and it will be ready for use soon.
There are great opportunities for developing fitness applications. Actrek SDK opens the door for Actrek developers to utilize Actrek’s Smart Fitness Platform and create features and functions on both mobiles device and the Actrek wearable device.

Since I was not gaining weight I did not associate my health problems with my diet, until I was 16 and my adult metabolism started to kick in, sparking a noticeable change in my weight. This caused a huge shift in my thinking, and slowly I began to change my eating habits to combat the effects of my old diet. Planning and research is like a hobby to me; every day I was learning something new and making little changes. It was a challenge to transition despite all the resources. I knew there had to be an easier way but I wasn't sure what that could be.  </span><br/></p>

<p>I attended an illustration class; the final project was to draw a cereal box or something found in a grocery store. The project sounded quite dull so to spice it up I decided to invent and draw a cool product that I would genuinely want to buy. I was transitioning into a healthy lifestyle and I love kits so I thought “What if there was a kit that had everything you needed for a healthy day?” As I was sketching, I was planning out the logistics in my head for fun and realized that this could actually help a lot of people, those who want to be healthier but don't know where to start. That very day I made the commitment to pursue what is now Intake, run by my corporation Flexible Integrated Tactics (FIT).</p>

It was a bluntly factual book about the significant harm a diet rich in animal products causes, and it stated that a well-executed vegan diet is the healthiest diet that contributes most to a healthy and prosperous environment, free of any cruelty. There is a negative stereotype of vegans circulating the web, yet they live among us as athletes, authors, teachers, celebrities and people you know. <p></p>

It's become a very normal way to live.  After lots more research and confirmation of facts, I made the decision to go vegan; the creation of Intake followed suit. Intake is not asking you to claim that you are a vegan right at this moment, but is simply providing you the opportunity to learn about the lifestyle and see how you like it!</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Becoming a vegan is the best thing I have ever done for myself. The amount of energy I have, the lightness I feel in the morning, the ease of sleep, the glowing skin, the thick hair, the strong nails, the clarity to think easier, is all thanks to my diet free of animal products. Meat, eggs and dairy are not needed by the body contrary to what we may have been taught. Once you remove these things, you open up room for an abundance of plant based foods to come in and improve your life in ways you didn't even think possible. When I started eating healthier my severe acne cleared up but it </span>wasn't<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> until I went vegan that my skin healed so significantly that I feel comfortable not ever wearing the heavy make-up I used to before. I feel great, I am more confident in who I am than ever before, and I feel at peace knowing that I contributed no harm to feel this way. Once you get here, you have no desire to go back.</span></span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">As more and more people begin to make the transition, businesses will respond with vegan options that will make being vegan even more accessible and affordable. It won't happen overnight, but little steps every day will make the biggest sustainable difference.</span><br/></p>

The photo below shows what Intake carries inside. It includes a grocery list of fresh ingredients, an assortment of dry ingredients, recipes, and tons of bonus content!You can make an entire day worth of meals for yourself and dinner for fourIntakes
takes the complications out of establishing a healthy lifestyle by providing
you with the plans, tools and the motivation for action so you don’t have to think; you can just do!  It takes the stress out of healthy eating while
providing a wholly nutritious diet, so you can live healthy, easy.Why Crowd Funding?I began this
campaign because I developed Intake, a product that will introduce you to a lifestyle
that is fulfilling, delicious, nutritious, easy to make, and cruelty-free. This
is an inclusive product for everyone because, put simply, everyone eats! I have
had a great response in my hometown; I even won the top prize of $12,000 in a
college run Dragon’s Den competition. My next step is to bring Intake into the
world (to you!), to expand into a variety of helpful products, planning
programs, and niche nutrition needs so everyone has the chance to experience the
benefits of enjoying life in a healthy body.FIT chose crowd-funding over conventional
strategies because the crowd is what is important to us: you and everyone you
know, on the same page, for change. What You are SupportingIntake
needs start-up funds to begin its journey to grocery shelves near you. All funding will go towards the mass processing and logistics of raw materials
required to produce Intake and fulfill your rewards! We will be purchasing raw materials, working with a manufacturer and logistics team, and marketing the product accordingly.We plan for large quantities of Intake, so that the price can be significantly lower
and more affordable for you. The more support we gain, the lower the price for you.My Intake



With the funds from this campaign, FIT will also launch into developing My Intake, a software that analyzes your current life, including where you need to be during the day, what foods you like/dislike, your goals, and more. It will create a plan of action for you that includes meal plans, exercise plans, lifestyle plans, product advice, and educational tools, indefinitely. Instead of apps that are just trackers, My Intake interacts with you throughout the day with helpful tips and reminders, scheduled for your day. It can be updated and changed to your evolving preferences at any time and it introduces you to new things every day rather than all at once. This is just one of the many endeavors FIT will embark upon to contribute to your success. 

Future Varieties
and Collaborations
The future
possibilities for Intake are endless. Currently there exists one variation of Intake, but FIT plans to develop multiple varieties
for different family sizes and food preferences, couples, college students,
seniors, and more. Intake has great advantage in that it has the versatility to
partner and collaborate with any product or service that shares our same vision
of a better tomorrow such as fitness services, nutrition services, personal care products, and at home tools. Intake plans to collaborate with as many existing
companies as possible to bring you more convenience in your journey.








You are a very
important part of making tomorrow a better place. Your positive actions will
influence the people in your life, creating a web from which the positive
action can travel freely. Your support today makes a statement that you
want a better tomorrow. You want a tomorrow filled with healthy, happy,
beneficial people who refrain from cruelty and harm. By supporting FIT today,
you claim…



""We will never have a perfect world, but it’s not romantic or naïve to work toward a better one"" -Steven Pinker for Chipotle Artist Series


Today you can
claim to everyone you know that a better tomorrow is on the way and you have done your part to support
it.

My Name is Madeline

I had a poor diet as a child and suffered many health problems because of it. Since I was not gaining weight I did not associate my health problems with my diet, until I was 16 and my adult metabolism started to kick in, sparking a noticeable change in my weight. This caused a huge shift in my thinking, and slowly I began to change my eating habits to combat the effects of my old diet. Planning and research is like a hobby to me; every day I was learning something new and making little changes. It was a challenge to transition despite all the resources. I knew there had to be an easier way but I wasn't sure what that could be.  

One Year Later...

I attended an illustration class; the final project was to draw a cereal box or something found in a grocery store. The project sounded quite dull so to spice it up I decided to invent and draw a cool product that I would genuinely want to buy. I was transitioning into a healthy lifestyle and I love kits so I thought “What if there was a kit that had everything you needed for a healthy day?” As I was sketching, I was planning out the logistics in my head for fun and realized that this could actually help a lot of people, those who want to be healthier but don't know where to start. That very day I made the commitment to pursue what is now Intake, run by my corporation Flexible Integrated Tactics (FIT).


Two months into the research and development of Intake I stumbled upon a book called Skinny Bitch by Rory Freedman and Kim Barnouin. It was a bluntly factual book about the significant harm a diet rich in animal products causes, and it stated that a well-executed vegan diet is the healthiest diet that contributes most to a healthy and prosperous environment, free of any cruelty. There is a negative stereotype of vegans circulating the web, yet they live among us as athletes, authors, teachers, celebrities and people you know. 

Vegan living provides a fulfilling diet for the betterment of the future and our communities. It's become a very normal way to live.  After lots more research and confirmation of facts, I made the decision to go vegan; the creation of Intake followed suit. Intake is not asking you to claim that you are a vegan right at this moment, but is simply providing you the opportunity to learn about the lifestyle and see how you like it!
Becoming a vegan is the best thing I have ever done for myself. The amount of energy I have, the lightness I feel in the morning, the ease of sleep, the glowing skin, the thick hair, the strong nails, the clarity to think easier, is all thanks to my diet free of animal products. Meat, eggs and dairy are not needed by the body contrary to what we may have been taught. Once you remove these things, you open up room for an abundance of plant based foods to come in and improve your life in ways you didn't even think possible. When I started eating healthier my severe acne cleared up but it wasn't until I went vegan that my skin healed so significantly that I feel comfortable not ever wearing the heavy make-up I used to before. I feel great, I am more confident in who I am than ever before, and I feel at peace knowing that I contributed no harm to feel this way. Once you get here, you have no desire to go back.
As more and more people begin to make the transition, businesses will respond with vegan options that will make being vegan even more accessible and affordable. It won't happen overnight, but little steps every day will make the biggest sustainable difference.

Risks & Challenges



Manufacturing delays are always a risk but with a strong logistics and operations manager, all details will be given full attention. We have allowed ample time in case of delays. 
I completed my Advanced Diploma at The Business School of Humber College. It has given me an in-depth understanding of how businesses are run from the ground up. I graduated with honors just as Intake was winning the funding money from the Dragon’s Den competition. I am a highly creative problem solver and I will use this skill to avoid potential setbacks and spin things for the better. Planning and research are no longer my hobbies; I have made these skills into my career.",23.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>You can easily imagine this Sunday “morning” at 1:00 pm, you just woke up with a headache, your room is a real mess and you have no motivation. The point is that you want to do something productive during your day like cleaning… and the revolutionary Clean Schalger 3.0 is made for you. Amazing.  </p>
<p>The CS 3.0 is the connected vacuum cleaner whom starts running when the level of dirtiness is too high. The detection is made by the Flemmix laser technology. It is used in several businesses (anti-robber systems, supermarket check-outs…) and testified by an ISO standard. It is a soft detection laser unable to cut you. The vacuum works in silence so it allows you to sleep or to Netflix and chill. An ameliorated version will perhaps allow the user to select the percentage of cleanliness expected.  </p>
<p>But the CS 3.0 is more than a revolutionary vacuum! On its top you could put a saucepan to heat water for your noodles or your tea. An articulated arm could also take stuffs for you to avoid you to go out of your bed. We worked with Apple developers to settle the virtual assistant SIRI in the CS3.0. Thus, it could allow you to have a conversation with the vacuum if you don’t have any friends or to listen your morning music ""Despacito"". Thanks to our market studies and our strong knowledge of the laziness market, we know that the ideal prices will be around 15 and 15,10 eur. We need to build a first prototype to launch the mass media communication. Due to economy of scales that we can not do, the price of the test model will be quite high…that’s why we need you! By helping us to build the first model you’ll take part of the project and you’ll perhaps benefit from a 50% discount when you will order your first CS 3.0.

<p>To control ADIVA you can use the supplied remote control, as well as the Smartphone App or Amazon Alexa. Alexa will be given as a gift along with ADIVA ONE to all buyers, if the INDIEGOGO campaign surpasses 200k Euro.</p>
<p>There are three predefined programs (P1, P2, P3), associated to each mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Sleep</strong> (night programs)</li>
<li>
<strong>Relaxation</strong> (day programs)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>You can further customise each of these programs by using the supplied App and select one of the operation types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Continuous oscillatory motion</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Automated on/off motion switch,</strong> applicable only to Sleep programs. The bed motion is triggered by your sleep status, which is further derived from the two motion sensors that are clipped on the bed mattress.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can tune each of the above operation types, through the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Duration</i> (e.g. Total operation time)</li>
<li><i>Motion Speed &amp; Intensity</i></li>
<li>
<i>Suspend</i> (Amount of time that the bed motion is still active after you fell asleep. This parameter is applicable only for the Automated on/off motion switch program; further explanations below).</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, we encourage you to use Alexa or the Remote control for controlling ADIVA ONE rather than the smartphone App, thus avoiding the smartphone screen blue light before going to sleep.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Automated on/off motion switch</strong></p>
<p>Given that each individual has a different sensitivity for the oscillatory motion and obviously you don't want to overdo that, we advise you to use the automated mode. ADIVA ONE senses your sleep status over a period of time, and based on that the bed motion is turned automatically on or off.</p>
<p>When you get asleep, meaning that you are no longer moving, ADIVA ONE’s motion controller turns off the bed motion after the programable <i>Suspend  </i>time has elapsed. Likewise if you wake up during the night and you start turning or moving on the bed, the bed oscillatory motion will again be automatically turned on.</p>
<p>Additionally ADIVA ONE will learn over a period of time (e.g. a couple of nights) your individual sleep cycles and adapt the bed motion patterns, in order to keep you as much as possible into a deep sleep. You can further tune this feature, by biasing the decisions taken by the device. Note: This feature is most effective for a single user, and could be disabled when there are two bed occupants.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Motion sensors</strong></p>
<p>The motion sensors are meant to be clipped on each side of the mattress. It is possible to disable any of them through the Smartphone App, in the case you share a double bed with a partner and he or she doesn't want to get the bed motion triggered by his or her sleep status.</p>

ADIVA ONE is a highly efficient solution for inducing sleep and relaxation. It applies a slow, oscillating motion to your bed (i.e. get rocked to sleep like a baby), using an integrated and programmable motion control system.
 
It consists of four supporting legs that attach to most existing beds or sofas. ADIVA ONE facilitates the onset and depth of sleep, meaning that you will feel refreshed even if you slept fewer hours than usual.
 
A key feature of our product is the integrated sleep monitoring and control system. It enables the device to monitor and analyse user sleep cycles through motion detector sensors and it automatically adjusts oscillation speed and intensity to promote and maintain deep sleep.
 
ADIVA ONE is the result of four years of research and development, including designing and testing several prototypes to achieve a near-silent, silky-smooth operating, and durable product. Our final prototype was demonstrated at CES in Las Vegas this year.
 

 

Sleep’s New Best Friend

Four modular supporting legs
Control unit which synchronises the legs' motion
Remote Control
Two wired motion sensors to be clipped to the bed mattress
Smartphone App for advanced control
Alexa voice control 

 
 

 

 
 

 
To control ADIVA you can use the supplied remote control, as well as the Smartphone App or Amazon Alexa. Alexa will be given as a gift along with ADIVA ONE to all buyers, if the INDIEGOGO campaign surpasses 200k Euro.
There are three predefined programs (P1, P2, P3), associated to each mode:


Sleep (night programs)

Relaxation (day programs)

 
You can further customise each of these programs by using the supplied App and select one of the operation types:

Continuous oscillatory motion

Automated on/off motion switch, applicable only to Sleep programs. The bed motion is triggered by your sleep status, which is further derived from the two motion sensors that are clipped on the bed mattress.

You can tune each of the above operation types, through the following parameters:


Duration (e.g. Total operation time)
Motion Speed & Intensity

Suspend (Amount of time that the bed motion is still active after you fell asleep. This parameter is applicable only for the Automated on/off motion switch program; further explanations below).

Finally, we encourage you to use Alexa or the Remote control for controlling ADIVA ONE rather than the smartphone App, thus avoiding the smartphone screen blue light before going to sleep.
 
Automated on/off motion switch
Given that each individual has a different sensitivity for the oscillatory motion and obviously you don't want to overdo that, we advise you to use the automated mode. ADIVA ONE senses your sleep status over a period of time, and based on that the bed motion is turned automatically on or off.
When you get asleep, meaning that you are no longer moving, ADIVA ONE’s motion controller turns off the bed motion after the programable Suspend  time has elapsed. Likewise if you wake up during the night and you start turning or moving on the bed, the bed oscillatory motion will again be automatically turned on.
Additionally ADIVA ONE will learn over a period of time (e.g. a couple of nights) your individual sleep cycles and adapt the bed motion patterns, in order to keep you as much as possible into a deep sleep. You can further tune this feature, by biasing the decisions taken by the device. Note: This feature is most effective for a single user, and could be disabled when there are two bed occupants.
 
Motion sensors
The motion sensors are meant to be clipped on each side of the mattress. It is possible to disable any of them through the Smartphone App, in the case you share a double bed with a partner and he or she doesn't want to get the bed motion triggered by his or her sleep status.
 

 
 
 
 


ADIVA ONE comes in five standard colors: Grey, Beige, White, Brown & Black, that you will select at checkout.
If you wish a custom color and finish for your new bed legs, you can order that as an additional option at the checkout. We will contact you to inquire about your color selection and finish at the end of the campaign. You could send us either a photo which shows your desired color, or the color code. We will make sure that you are pleased with the result, by sending you a picture with the legs, before they are shipped to you.
 
 
 
 

A research study made by the Sleep Laboratory at the Geneva University Hospital in Switzerland demonstrates the beneficial effects of the slow oscillatory motion for improving sleep onset, quality, and depth, by using a slow rocking bed.
 

 
Dr. Michel Muhlethaler, co-author of this study concluded in an interview: “We observed a faster transition to sleep in each and every subject in the swaying condition.” He also highlighted another key benefit of sleeping on a gentle swinging bed: “It’s not just that you go faster to sleep, but also while you sleep, your sleep is deeper”.
 
Another recent study made by the same team concludes that:

Rocking boosts deep sleep, sleep maintenance, and memory in healthy sleepers
Fast spindles increase during rocking and synchronize with the slow oscillation up-state
Rocking-induced overnight memory improvement relates to increased sigma activity
Continuous rocking stimulation actively entrains intrinsic sleep oscillations

 
These results provide a strong scientific support to the traditional belief that rocking can soothe our sleep, and produce a calming effect.

  ADIVA ONE is as complex as the drive train of a four wheel drive electric car. It uses high quality silent servomotors and proprietary FOC controllers, one pair for each leg.We developed our technology using the finest quality custom manufactured electro-mechanical components to produce a gentle and whisper-quiet motion. The only noise produced by the system comes from the bearings, which is negligible. Electrical:
Operating power consumption range (load dependent): from 20 W for a single bed, to 50 W for a very large Californian bed
Standby power consumption: 4 W
FOC servo controllers, proprietary technology
WIFI, Bluetooth connections
AC/DC Power Supply Unit: 12V, 60W
 Mechanical:
Legs robust stainless steel design, to support a bed including the occupants weighing up to 1000kg / 2200lbs
Motion oscillation range: 4 cm / 1.6”
Whisper quiet 20dBA actuators
Leg weight: 7.5 kg / 16.5 lbs; Legs total weight (*4 units): 30 Kg / 66 lbs
Leg dimensions: 23.7 cm (L) * 11.8 cm (W) * 14.7 cm (H)  / 9.5 in (L) * 4.5 in (W) * 6 in (H)
Leg flat surface support: 28.8 cm (L) * 12.6 cm (W)  / 11.4 in (L) * 5 in (W)
Packaged Weight: Comes in two boxes each weighing 17.5 kg / 38.5 lbs
Packaged Dimensions: Each box size: 48 cm x 32 cm x 25 cm / 19 in x 12.5 in x 10 in
   ADIVA ONE will be manufactured in Europe.It will ship worldwide through TNT, the cost varying by country at check out, from 90 to 270 Euro. Shipping cost heavily depends upon the number of orders from a specific region/country. More orders from a region will reduce the shipping cost per unit, and therefore any balance amount from the shipping charge will be refunded once the campaign ends.   A good night’s sleep is more than just the best way to end the day; it’s the foundation for a healthy, happy life.We are passionate about using technology to drive change in the world of sleep, and we are excited to have you onboard as we make it happen. Thank youfor backing us!",32.0,1,"1 Campaign

Linens in hotel rooms get washed and sanitized between users but pillows do not. And what about those pillows offered on airlines during long flights? Should you use them?Studies supported by health authorities proved pillows carried such viruses and bacteria as E. Coli, MRSA, and flu. We know many of these illnesses exist outside the hospital settings today. Why are pillows a source for infection?Pillows that are shared on a regular basis, such as those offered on long distance air flights and in hotel rooms across the globe often have a life span far beyond what manufacturers recommend. Pillows have small holes in them where needles pierced the material during the sewing process, plus over time they do develop rips and tears; and some pillows are created using materials that have a wide weave. Minute as they may seem all of these holes are a place for bacteria and other contaminates to enter and live within the construct materials.Fungal spores can also live within a pillow, a food source for dust mites. Sharing a pillow used by many hundreds of other people can easily become a perfect place for fungus to grow. This makes travel seriously difficult for allergy sufferers. How do contaminants get in to a pillow?Whether they admit it or not many people drool when they sleep. If a person is ill, whether actively or not, their saliva can soak through the pillow case and in to the pillow material itself. Saliva can contain any number of infectious agents that can seep through the pillow case and in to the pillows material.If the last person to use a pillow had been ill and vomiting trace amounts of vomitus may still remain in their saliva, introducing still other types of bacteria or viral contaminants in to the pillow.Sweat and other bodily fluids are other means by which contaminants can be left behind and absorbed in to the base material of a pillow.World travel is so easy, and necessary in today’s global atmosphere. So exposure to a huge range of viral and bacterial contagions is possible.The SciencePneumaPure Technology is the intelligent application of a liquid- proof filter mechanism to a cushioning product – a pillow, duvet, mattress and cushion.The filter is a liquid-proof nano-porous composite; it is hydrophobic and acts as a breathable barrier. In effect, the PneumaPure filter prevents the passage of liquid and air borne pathogens to the interior of the product, whilst allowing the product to breathe. (Air transport in and out of the product is essential to allow proper shaping and draping to the patient). PneumaPure Technology is proven to be highly effective in preventing the ingress of pathogens e.g. MRSA, Norovirus, C. diff, E. coli, etc. to the interior of a bedding product.  Who is Gabriel Scientific?Gabriel Scientific is an award winning life sciences company. The company has addressed the significant risk posed to Safe Patient Environments through the invention of the PneumaPure range of barrier bedding.Having created medical grade bedding and pillows to aid in the processes of infection control, we now expanding our line to include caring for the health and safety of consumers outside health care settings.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

My name is Charles Johnson, I am a 45 years old fitness instructor ( 7 years strong ) who is passionate about fitness and helping others to becoming a better version of themselves, particularly ones who are in or around my age group because as we get older, our metabolism slows down and exercise and proper diets is key to healthy living.  This is the reason why I launched this campaign ""Hotel Fitness Gurus"" with our slogan ""Fitness Experts, At Your Service"" here on Indiegogo because I wanted to find a platform that would allow me to pitch my idea effectively to raise funds needed the further work on my business concept where we connect passionate fitness professionals with  On-the Go health and fitness conscious guests looking for a real-life personal fitness professional to help keep them on task with their workout session in real time during their getaway at their favorite hotel, resort,etc. either on business or leisure travel.Picture this scenario below:IMAGINE- You're an entrepreneur going on a business trip or maybe you're planning a trip with the family for your family vacation . Either case, you plan to book your room at a nice hotel, perhaps at the Hilton hotel in Nashville, TN. As you make your search on various websites you find the perfect hotel at the right price with a room with a view that you also noticed has a very nice State-of-The-Art Fitness Center in addition to the ""miniature fitness center"" located right in your room called ""Five Feet to Fitness"", Hilton's new in-room Fitness Kiosk as part of their larger wellness experience, equipped with all the bells and whistles ( See Photo Gallery ). You book the room and discover that you don't have a clue how you use the equipment and  after calling their technical engineer on staff  to help you to make sense of it, he shows you how to use the equipment and leaves you watching a PiYo instructor on a monitor. So, after 10 mins. you give up feeling frustrated...this is your first time trying PiYo and her moves are too complicated for you as a beginner. You try to switch to another program and you can't because you forgot how to operate the equipment. So, now you simply try using the kettle bells provided, but never done it before and doing pull-ups ( Are you kidding me ) is simply out of the question. You feel lost, confused and since you selected that room because of the in room ""fitness center"" kiosk ( Five Feet to Fitness ) you feel short-changed! ""If only I had my very own real-life personal fitness consultant to help me out ... to answer my personal questions (if I had any )and not some pre-recorded  generic message... Someone who can provide individualized coaching specifically for me and my needs as a beginner taking PiYo  for the first time. I need to be motivated even pushed in my workout sessions. And I just like that human touch from time to time, like a warm friendly smile, a handshake, or even a hug and someone rewarding me with a genuine heartfelt commendation like "" Job well done...Thank you, have a nice day! ""  and etc.""  I am sure each of you can relate to at least one of these concerns, right?  Perhaps the scenario above is how you felt when you worked out at the fitness center in the hotel  you  stayed at during your  business trip or perhaps that holiday excursion you went on a few months back.

<h3>Forward</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Annoying pollen, cat dander, ragweed allergy?  We know the feeling – you spend more time sneezing in tissues instead of enjoying the holiday BBQ!   Over-the-counter treatments such as Zyrtec, Xzyal, and Claritin have been tried one after the other.   These treatments are expensive.  Sometimes they work, other times they don’t.    </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Next option?  Allergen therapy is available and administered by a doctor which works to familiarize your immune system with the agent for which you have sensitivity.  However, allergen therapy is administered through painful skin injections that require inconvenient weekly or monthly office visits. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">There is an easier way!  Researchers at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland have recently published a study demonstrating the effectiveness of personalized medication compounds for allergen therapy.  These compounds are easily dropped under the tongue and self-administered at home.   Introducing…  “sublingual immunotherapy.”</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Unfortunately, you may need to book a trip to Baltimore for this therapy today.  Your neighborhood pharmacies lack the time, resources, and expertise to compound sublingual immunotherapy.  </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Phoenix Medicine will seize this critical patient care opportunity by partnering with your doctor to supply you with personalized compounded sublingual immunotherapy.  Phoenix Medicine will be the premier pharmacy serving patients across the United States that are ready to consider sublingual immunotherapy.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Sublingual immunotherapy is recommended from three to five years to sustain desensitization effects and prevent new allergy sensitization. After this therapy, it is not typical to need retreatment after the initial course for a period of 15 to 20 years, with some patients experiencing longer tolerance periods.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">There are factors that might make sublingual immunotherapy not the best treatment option.  Your doctor and a Phoenix Medicine pharmacist will screen you for factors that may make the therapy non-responsive or unsafe.</p>

Annoying pollen, cat dander, ragweed allergy?  We know the feeling – you spend more time sneezing in tissues instead of enjoying the holiday BBQ!   Over-the-counter treatments such as Zyrtec, Xzyal, and Claritin have been tried one after the other.   These treatments are expensive.  Sometimes they work, other times they don’t.    
Next option?  Allergen therapy is available and administered by a doctor which works to familiarize your immune system with the agent for which you have sensitivity.  However, allergen therapy is administered through painful skin injections that require inconvenient weekly or monthly office visits. 
There is an easier way!  Researchers at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland have recently published a study demonstrating the effectiveness of personalized medication compounds for allergen therapy.  These compounds are easily dropped under the tongue and self-administered at home.   Introducing…  “sublingual immunotherapy.”
Unfortunately, you may need to book a trip to Baltimore for this therapy today.  Your neighborhood pharmacies lack the time, resources, and expertise to compound sublingual immunotherapy.  
Phoenix Medicine will seize this critical patient care opportunity by partnering with your doctor to supply you with personalized compounded sublingual immunotherapy.  Phoenix Medicine will be the premier pharmacy serving patients across the United States that are ready to consider sublingual immunotherapy.
Sublingual immunotherapy is recommended from three to five years to sustain desensitization effects and prevent new allergy sensitization. After this therapy, it is not typical to need retreatment after the initial course for a period of 15 to 20 years, with some patients experiencing longer tolerance periods.
There are factors that might make sublingual immunotherapy not the best treatment option.  Your doctor and a Phoenix Medicine pharmacist will screen you for factors that may make the therapy non-responsive or unsafe.

Overall Funding
It is desired that Phoenix Medicine ($350,000 goal) is launched in December 2018 to offer sublingual immunotherapy to patients with quality standards. This will be fast-tracked with meeting our ultimate funding needs of $750,000 for full pharmacy implementation.


 
Fund Infusion Breakdown
Development, Pharmacy Build, & Materials (70% of funding goal): Our location, construction, and inventory carrying costs will constitute the bulk of expected expenses. We want to build a strong laboratory-like and regulation compliant facility to provide quality personalized medication compounds for allergen therapy.  We work closely with your doctor to understand your unique profile of allergen sensitivity.
Research & Development (5%): We want to continuously fuel innovation in health systems, hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare sectors by exploring needs to enhance sublingual immunotherapy available to treat and protect patients.
Interviews/Travel (5%): We will need to travel to spread the word about sublingual immunotherapy treatment.  Phoenix Medicine team members will deliver platform and poster presentations at national physician, nurse, and pharmacist organization conferences.
Advertising and Distribution (2%): The only way we will be able to make an impact with our company/product is to raise awareness.
Fundraising Fees (7%): Part of our funding will go to crowdfunding and credit card fees.
Legal (10%): Legal protocols and fees do apply when building a pharmacy to assure compliance and inspections are up to date to assure a successful opening.
Website Development (1%): An accessible website where interested patients can learn more about sublingual immunotherapy is desired. We want to provide resources that patients can use to become the expert in their therapy.

<h3>Krazyweights-A new innovative training weight</h3>
<p>I was inspired to help improve my son's batting skills and abilities. The idea of Krazyweights  took awhile to become a design concept, from sketches to mock up prototypes to a functional prototype model.</p>
<p>Hi, my name is Gary Brown; an Architect /Designer and now inventor of this new innovative training weight. Krazyweights is designed for young players through high school, into college and beyond for mature athletes.</p>
<p>This training weight replace the old fashion ""Donut Ring"" or weighted sleeve at the barrel end of a baseball bat. This new idea put the weight and control in the hands of the player.</p>
<p>The krazyweights secure  to the bottom of a baseball or softball bat, lacrosse stick or tennis racket. It does not interfere with the hands, wrist or forearms when used during practice. This puts the weight and control in the players hands.</p>
<p>Weight will be sized for the proper age group. The Krazyweights has modular screw-on weights to add more resistances to improve player's strength. </p>
<p>As part of the Krazyweights team,  your contribution will help complete the patent process and development for production. I strongly believe this product is unique for local and international sports use.</p>
<p><strong> <u>Campaign funds breakdown.</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>  I have a patent pending and a registered trade name with the US Patent Office. I need to bring the patent to the next step in September 2018 and then follow through to completion.</li>
<li>This cost could add up to $12,500 or more.</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> The prototype design and function is complete, we need to refine the material for durability and smooth operations for the younger players. This will require  materials to be </span>fabricated<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> for testing.This cost could additional engineering and material selection could cost up to $25,000. </span>
</li>
<li>The research team will develop the proper weights for the appropriate age group. This relates to overall weight of the unit, as well as individual components. </li>
<li>The Krazyweights team plans to recruit a sport science team to evaluate the  performance value and impact while using the Krazyweights.</li>
<li>Our Engineers will refine the jaw design to be adaptable for bat manufacture's knob design. We will need multiple injection molds for different  knob models. We'll develop separate jaw designs for lacrosse sticks and tennis rackets.  Additional engineering for jaw designs, CAD drawing file to product labs for proper sizing and testing.  </li>
<li>This operation could range from $8,500 to $22,500.    </li>
<li><i>I've started a Krazyweights concept design for Hockey sticks. This is a unique idea for young players to keep there sticks on the ice during practices. The Krazyweights would attach to the shaft of the stick while not interfering  with the stick's function during practice. This is part of the on going expansion of Krazyweights ideas. Hockey is 3rd most popular sport in the world.</i></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>These steps will assist us to make the jump from prototype to manufacturing and into the  marketplace.   </strong>                                                                                                                                                               </p>
<p><u><strong>PERKs-</strong></u></p>
<ul>
<li>Team boosters (members) will be placed on the Krazyweights Hall Of Fame. This listed will be on the Website for public viewing. Categories will be ; First Ballot, Honorable Mention, Inductees and Founding Members , depending on the donations.</li>
<li>I would encourage boosters to offer color schemes options for final productions.</li>
<li>I would encourage  booster to offer product  names for each weight class, i.e., Big Thunder.</li>
<li>I desire to make this an interactive campaign; to have fun and be creative.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Krazyweights's Impact to players</strong></p>
<p><strong>People may see this as a sports product for young player, and they may be right. I see think as part of a bigger picture for youths to develop  their physical abilities but also their inner confidence of achievements. Players are put in positions that they may not be prepared for, stress, pressure to perform, team peer pressure, etc. </strong></p>
<p><strong>If a player can develop their own physical and inner confidence during practice, then they may be better prepared for the game. Krazyweights will be able to grow with the player with additional modular weights.</strong></p>
<p>The research shows approximately 2.6 million Little Leaguers in the USA along, with 8 International Regions throughout the world, with approximately 3.5 million players. The USA has numerous baseball leagues for all ages throughout the Country. There are approximately 35 million ball players registered  in 122 counties world wide.  The USA has approximately 9.5 millions young girls/women softball players of all ages throughout the USA. There are approximately 40 million softball players in men and women leagues in the USA. There are approximately 1.5 million women playing softball in International Leagues.</p>
<p> Research shows approximately 850,000 Lacrosse players all ages in the USA.  Tennis has approximately 14 million players in the USA of all ages, from 7 to 77. This the 4th most popular sport in the world, approximately 1.2 B watch or play tennis throughout the world.</p>
<p> These numbers are impressive, but every year there is a new group of players stepping into these sports start their own future. Krazyweights will be there to help them along to meet their goals.</p>
</div><div><p><strong>Risk and Rewards</strong></p></div><div><ul>
<li> I started this adventure with an idea and a sketch pad. </li>
<li>I focused on this concept for over two years before getting others involved.</li>
<li>I feel strongly about this product. I took out a second mortgage on my house to pay for the concept start up.</li>
<li>I was accepted into a start-up business incubators program for entrepreneurs. I also attended Small Business classes as part of NH Chapter of SCORE monthly meetings. I've  done as much as possible to learn much as I can in this short period of time. </li>
<li>After 4 1/2 years of undergraduate night school while working full time and being married (now going on forty years), I don't give up, I set goals to achieve them.</li>
<li><strong>Through networking I found new people to assist me to this point. I ask for help when I come to a road block. This is one of those road blocks, So I'm looking to build a team of boosters to help us cross the finish line together and then into the production line. We don't give up.</strong></li>

</div><p> </p></div>","Krazyweights-A new innovative training weight
I was inspired to help improve my son's batting skills and abilities. The idea of Krazyweights  took awhile to become a design concept, from sketches to mock up prototypes to a functional prototype model.
Hi, my name is Gary Brown; an Architect /Designer and now inventor of this new innovative training weight. Krazyweights is designed for young players through high school, into college and beyond for mature athletes.
This training weight replace the old fashion ""Donut Ring"" or weighted sleeve at the barrel end of a baseball bat. This new idea put the weight and control in the hands of the player.
The krazyweights secure  to the bottom of a baseball or softball bat, lacrosse stick or tennis racket. It does not interfere with the hands, wrist or forearms when used during practice. This puts the weight and control in the players hands.
Weight will be sized for the proper age group. The Krazyweights has modular screw-on weights to add more resistances to improve player's strength. 
As part of the Krazyweights team,  your contribution will help complete the patent process and development for production. I strongly believe this product is unique for local and international sports use.
 Campaign funds breakdown.

  I have a patent pending and a registered trade name with the US Patent Office. I need to bring the patent to the next step in September 2018 and then follow through to completion.
This cost could add up to $12,500 or more.

 The prototype design and function is complete, we need to refine the material for durability and smooth operations for the younger players. This will require  materials to be fabricated for testing.This cost could additional engineering and material selection could cost up to $25,000. 

The research team will develop the proper weights for the appropriate age group. This relates to overall weight of the unit, as well as individual components. 
The Krazyweights team plans to recruit a sport science team to evaluate the  performance value and impact while using the Krazyweights.
Our Engineers will refine the jaw design to be adaptable for bat manufacture's knob design. We will need multiple injection molds for different  knob models. We'll develop separate jaw designs for lacrosse sticks and tennis rackets.  Additional engineering for jaw designs, CAD drawing file to product labs for proper sizing and testing.  
This operation could range from $8,500 to $22,500.    
I've started a Krazyweights concept design for Hockey sticks. This is a unique idea for young players to keep there sticks on the ice during practices. The Krazyweights would attach to the shaft of the stick while not interfering  with the stick's function during practice. This is part of the on going expansion of Krazyweights ideas. Hockey is 3rd most popular sport in the world.

These steps will assist us to make the jump from prototype to manufacturing and into the  marketplace.                                                                                                                                                                  
PERKs-

Team boosters (members) will be placed on the Krazyweights Hall Of Fame. This listed will be on the Website for public viewing. Categories will be ; First Ballot, Honorable Mention, Inductees and Founding Members , depending on the donations.
I would encourage boosters to offer color schemes options for final productions.
I would encourage  booster to offer product  names for each weight class, i.e., Big Thunder.
I desire to make this an interactive campaign; to have fun and be creative.

Krazyweights's Impact to players
People may see this as a sports product for young player, and they may be right. I see think as part of a bigger picture for youths to develop  their physical abilities but also their inner confidence of achievements. Players are put in positions that they may not be prepared for, stress, pressure to perform, team peer pressure, etc. 
If a player can develop their own physical and inner confidence during practice, then they may be better prepared for the game. Krazyweights will be able to grow with the player with additional modular weights.
The research shows approximately 2.6 million Little Leaguers in the USA along, with 8 International Regions throughout the world, with approximately 3.5 million players. The USA has numerous baseball leagues for all ages throughout the Country. There are approximately 35 million ball players registered  in 122 counties world wide.  The USA has approximately 9.5 millions young girls/women softball players of all ages throughout the USA. There are approximately 40 million softball players in men and women leagues in the USA. There are approximately 1.5 million women playing softball in International Leagues.
 Research shows approximately 850,000 Lacrosse players all ages in the USA.  Tennis has approximately 14 million players in the USA of all ages, from 7 to 77. This the 4th most popular sport in the world, approximately 1.2 B watch or play tennis throughout the world.
 These numbers are impressive, but every year there is a new group of players stepping into these sports start their own future. Krazyweights will be there to help them along to meet their goals.
Risk and Rewards
 I started this adventure with an idea and a sketch pad. 
I focused on this concept for over two years before getting others involved.
I feel strongly about this product. I took out a second mortgage on my house to pay for the concept start up.
I was accepted into a start-up business incubators program for entrepreneurs. I also attended Small Business classes as part of NH Chapter of SCORE monthly meetings. I've  done as much as possible to learn much as I can in this short period of time. 
After 4 1/2 years of undergraduate night school while working full time and being married (now going on forty years), I don't give up, I set goals to achieve them.
Through networking I found new people to assist me to this point. I ask for help when I come to a road block. This is one of those road blocks, So I'm looking to build a team of boosters to help us cross the finish line together and then into the production line. We don't give up.

Please spread the WORD... and the word is KRAZYWEIGHTS

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am shocked by what is happening in the world at the moment and how much misinformation there is out there about how to protect yourself from the Coronavirus.</p>
<p>We are a team of Engineers and Microbiologists and have designed a  very ingenious tool that will keep you safe from the virus deposited on surfaces in a proper and scientifically sound way.</p>
<p>With your contribution, we will be able to commence production of our innovative design and assist the population, especially those in remote areas, from this novel disease.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>When the Coronavirus pandemic came about, I started protecting myself by making sure my hands were clean. However, I could not avoid touching door knobs and other pushbuttons, like in the elevator. I knew that these surfaces were very likely to be infected, so after touching them I was very conscious about not touching my face. However, this is a lot more difficult that it seems.</p>
<p>I am an Engineer by profession and a Microbiologist by passion. I have experience with medical devices, so I know how a virus can easily transfer from surface to surface by touch, so buying one of the brass door helpers on the market was not an option. They claim that copper and brass kill the virus in 2 to 4 hours. However, during these 2 to 4 hours, the virus is alive and on the surface of the tool. If this surface touches anything on your clothing, it would be transferred there and there it can live for many days, so having an exposed tool made of any materials was useless.</p>
<p>In fact, it is not just useless, but dangerous, as it will give you a false sense of safety. It will transfer the virus onto surfaces that you cannot easily and periodically clean, as you would with your hands, so it is better to use your hands that any of those exposed tools currently out there.</p>
<p>I have a business that designs medical devices, so I got my engineers to work in a project that will result in a door helper device that would be safe to use.</p>
<p>My engineers came up with a design that is not only safer to use, but recyclable and environmentally friendly. It was also designed so that it can be easily manufactured at various locations in the world so that it doesn’t need to be shipped.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I want to make it as affordable as possible, use materials that will not hurt the environment and avoid long sea shipping at all costs.</p>
<p>We need the money to setup manufacturing and packaging facilities in various parts of the world, this way, we would not only be avoiding shipping, but helping the local economies. In the first instance, we plan to manufacture in Australia, USA, Spain and Argentina.</p>
<p>With your contribution, you will get an ENCLOSED HYGIENIC ANTIMICROBIAL HELPER, as well as a HEAVY DUTY RETRACTABLE REEL with every Helper.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sturdy steel casing</li>
<li>Side belt clip</li>
<li>750mm Hi tensile Nylon cord</li>
<li>Split ring attachment</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why is This Tool Important and Why Do You Need It?</h3>
<p>We’re currently living though a health and economic crisis the likes of which none of us have ever experienced before, and we all need to adjust in how we work, live of our lives, and do things in general.</p>
<p>One thing that is clear is that we cannot continue to touch surfaces, like doorknobs or buttons that so many people also touched.</p>
<p>The currently available tools that are used to assist in doing these things without touching them are dangerous, as they become infected and then they touch our body or our clothing and transfer the infection to those parts. It doesn’t matter if they are made of copper of brass, as these metals take up to 4 hours to kill the virus and during that time, they continue to be infectious.</p>
<p>As an Engineer and Microbiologist, I realized that it was of extreme importance that the infected portion of the tool remained out of touch. Our design keep any infected part enclosed within the tool, this way it is safe to use.</p>
<p><u>HOW IS THIS DESIGN BETTER?</u></p>
<p>The inner part of your ENCLOSED HYGIENIC ANTIMICROBIAL HELPER will get germs on it and get infected. It is important to keep this infected part away from you, because wherever it touches, it will spread those germs:</p>
<ul>
<li>If it touches your hand, it will transfer the germs there</li>
<li>If it touches your pants, it will transfer the germs there</li>
<li>If it touches anything on your body, it will transfer the germs there</li>

</div></div>","Short Summary
I am shocked by what is happening in the world at the moment and how much misinformation there is out there about how to protect yourself from the Coronavirus.
We are a team of Engineers and Microbiologists and have designed a  very ingenious tool that will keep you safe from the virus deposited on surfaces in a proper and scientifically sound way.
With your contribution, we will be able to commence production of our innovative design and assist the population, especially those in remote areas, from this novel disease.
 
My Story
When the Coronavirus pandemic came about, I started protecting myself by making sure my hands were clean. However, I could not avoid touching door knobs and other pushbuttons, like in the elevator. I knew that these surfaces were very likely to be infected, so after touching them I was very conscious about not touching my face. However, this is a lot more difficult that it seems.
I am an Engineer by profession and a Microbiologist by passion. I have experience with medical devices, so I know how a virus can easily transfer from surface to surface by touch, so buying one of the brass door helpers on the market was not an option. They claim that copper and brass kill the virus in 2 to 4 hours. However, during these 2 to 4 hours, the virus is alive and on the surface of the tool. If this surface touches anything on your clothing, it would be transferred there and there it can live for many days, so having an exposed tool made of any materials was useless.
In fact, it is not just useless, but dangerous, as it will give you a false sense of safety. It will transfer the virus onto surfaces that you cannot easily and periodically clean, as you would with your hands, so it is better to use your hands that any of those exposed tools currently out there.
I have a business that designs medical devices, so I got my engineers to work in a project that will result in a door helper device that would be safe to use.
My engineers came up with a design that is not only safer to use, but recyclable and environmentally friendly. It was also designed so that it can be easily manufactured at various locations in the world so that it doesn’t need to be shipped.
 

What We Need & What You Get
I want to make it as affordable as possible, use materials that will not hurt the environment and avoid long sea shipping at all costs.
We need the money to setup manufacturing and packaging facilities in various parts of the world, this way, we would not only be avoiding shipping, but helping the local economies. In the first instance, we plan to manufacture in Australia, USA, Spain and Argentina.
With your contribution, you will get an ENCLOSED HYGIENIC ANTIMICROBIAL HELPER, as well as a HEAVY DUTY RETRACTABLE REEL with every Helper.

Sturdy steel casing
Side belt clip
750mm Hi tensile Nylon cord
Split ring attachment

 

Why is This Tool Important and Why Do You Need It?
We’re currently living though a health and economic crisis the likes of which none of us have ever experienced before, and we all need to adjust in how we work, live of our lives, and do things in general.
One thing that is clear is that we cannot continue to touch surfaces, like doorknobs or buttons that so many people also touched.
The currently available tools that are used to assist in doing these things without touching them are dangerous, as they become infected and then they touch our body or our clothing and transfer the infection to those parts. It doesn’t matter if they are made of copper of brass, as these metals take up to 4 hours to kill the virus and during that time, they continue to be infectious.
As an Engineer and Microbiologist, I realized that it was of extreme importance that the infected portion of the tool remained out of touch. Our design keep any infected part enclosed within the tool, this way it is safe to use.
HOW IS THIS DESIGN BETTER?
The inner part of your ENCLOSED HYGIENIC ANTIMICROBIAL HELPER will get germs on it and get infected. It is important to keep this infected part away from you, because wherever it touches, it will spread those germs:

If it touches your hand, it will transfer the germs there
If it touches your pants, it will transfer the germs there
If it touches anything on your body, it will transfer the germs there
If it touches your handbag, etc, it will transfer the germs there.

THAT IS WHY THE INNER PART IS INSIDE A PROTECTIVE COVER.
THIS WAY, NO INFECTED PART WILL TOUCH ANYTHING ON YOUR BODY OR YOUR POSSESSIONS.
 

Risks & Opportunities
In these times of lockdowns and companies on low production, it is possible that we might encounter delays or other unexpected hurdles with production and shipment.
To mitigate those risks, we are in discussion with reputable companies that are capable of manufacturing and shipping our product. So far, we have contacted companies in Sydney (Australia), Rosario (Argentina), Boston (USA) and Barcelona (Spain). All these companies stated that there are no expected difficulties with fulfilling our orders.

<h3>Our Story So Far...</h3>
<p>After injuring my lower back I became frustrated with products available to help in recovery.  The various compression belts I tried were extremely uncomfortable, I hated having to lay still while using ice packs and lumbar cushions have to be repositioned constantly to keep them in the right spot.   I soon realized that it would be far easier to attach everything to a compression belt to hold it all in the right spot no matter how many times I got up or what chair I was sitting in.  Three years and a dozen prototypes later I have come up with a system that does just that.</p>
<p>The Black Belt combines three common treatments into a single system that gives you the flexibility to do one or all three at the same time while remaining mobile. </p>
<ul>
<li>You can use the compression belt by itself to stabilize your lower back while lifting or bending.  </li>
<li>Attach the Lumbar Support Cushion to the belt, then wrap it around your waist to keep it in place.</li>
<li>Add in the Thermal Gel Pack and you can easily position an ice pack right where you need it whether sitting, standing or walking around.</li>
</ul>
<p>My goal is to provide all of the tools you need to recover from lower back injuries and help prevent future damage while maximizing your mobility and comfort.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>My real goal with this project is to help as many people as possible reduce their back pain and prevent future injuries.  If you are fortunate enough to have no back issues you can still help by sharing information about The Black Belt with your friends and family who are not as lucky.  </p>
</div></div>","Our Story So Far...
After injuring my lower back I became frustrated with products available to help in recovery.  The various compression belts I tried were extremely uncomfortable, I hated having to lay still while using ice packs and lumbar cushions have to be repositioned constantly to keep them in the right spot.   I soon realized that it would be far easier to attach everything to a compression belt to hold it all in the right spot no matter how many times I got up or what chair I was sitting in.  Three years and a dozen prototypes later I have come up with a system that does just that.
The Black Belt combines three common treatments into a single system that gives you the flexibility to do one or all three at the same time while remaining mobile. 

You can use the compression belt by itself to stabilize your lower back while lifting or bending.  
Attach the Lumbar Support Cushion to the belt, then wrap it around your waist to keep it in place.
Add in the Thermal Gel Pack and you can easily position an ice pack right where you need it whether sitting, standing or walking around.

My goal is to provide all of the tools you need to recover from lower back injuries and help prevent future damage while maximizing your mobility and comfort.

Sleep problem




‘The plague of light in our bedrooms’
Researchers warn of the health dangers of too much light while we try to sleep. 
By Tom de Castella                                                      

‘Spreading the Word about Light Pollution’
Researchers warn of the health dangers of too much light while we try to sleep. 
By Troy Lambert 









Sound and light can be used to induce better sleep. Sleep sense mask blocks external light completely. It induces a deep sleep with an auditory pattern and it will wake you refreshed with a light pattern based on your personal and individual sleep formula.


3 in 1 (Systemized)




Functions









Sleep sense provides a personalized sleep inducing sound pattern to help you sleep comfortably and deeply. Sleep sense will learn your sleep pattern and it will improve itself for maximum efficacy. No more ear-phone or smart phone kept playing music next to you. The personalized sleep inducing sound or music comes from bone conduction transducers inside the mask.  This stops automatically when you fall asleep.





Sleep sense provides an artificial sunrise alarm during the light sleep stage so you wake up refreshed.  No more annoying alarms.  You will experience a peaceful and energetic morning with Bright Alarm! (*A cure for jet lag. If travelers were exposed to intermittent light while sleeping in the early morning, your body would be fooled into thinking the sun had risen earlier.)    












Sleep sense provides a personal sleep diary mobile application.  It monitors daily sleep quality with initial bedtime, time in bed, wake up time, sleep pattern, relationship to others, affect of caffeine, daytime grogginess, etc.  We work so hard to care for our health in the daytime, but nighttime is just as important.  Perhaps even more important?



Specification



 



Sleep Sense better your sleep quality












How it works











Smart Sleep Mask 
Our mask is light and comfortable even if it is embedded with cutting edge sensors. Our sound and light therapy will induce you to deeper and healthier sleep by stabilizing  your body and mind. With Sleep Sense, you can relax, fall asleep faster, and maintain deep sleep during the whole night, which provides you better feelings after waking up. 
Smartphone App
We created an intuitive way to visualize your sleep information and general health conditions and to let you know more about your sleep quality.. We analyze big data from our app to provide you with a personalized sleep care.
Smart Cloud Feedback
The last ingredient of Sleep Sense is the AI sleep assistant, a cloud-based machine learning AI. It analyses the sleep data gathered by f.mask and combines that with ambient environmental data like temperature, weather, and humidity, looking for patterns in the data and offering suggestions to optimize sleep schedules. In this aspect, AI plays the role of a sleep assistant.

Why Is Healthy Sleep Important? 

Sleep is vital for learning and memory, and lack of sleep impacts our health, safety, and longevity. In the short term, a lack of adequate sleep can affect judgment, mood, ability to learn and retain information, and may increase the risk of serious accidents and injury. In the long term, chronic sleep deprivation may lead to a host of health problems including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and even early mortality.  - Harvard Medical School


What Is Good Sleep?


Falling into deep sleep
Having a constant sleep cycle with reaching sleep stages (light, deep)
Waking up at the right time of your sleep cycle without grogginess



How to make user fall asleep deeper

A person has 90-minute sleep cycle with deep sleep and shallow sleep. Meanwhile the brainwave changes from beta to alpha, theta, and  delta. Delta brainwave signal comes out when a person is in deep sleep stage. 
With the bone conduction speakers, binaural beats are delivered in accordance with the user's brain activity referring one's sleep stage.(Using Brainwave Synchronization technology) By checking the brain signal and giving appropriate binaural beats simultaneously to generate sleeping stage brainwave, Sleep Sense helps users to fall asleep faster and wake up feeling refreshed.


How to wake user up feeling refreshed

LED lights help user to wake up naturally by providing Artificial Sunrise. While tracking the bio-signals during sleep, the mask detects user's sleep cycle and wakes user up at the perfect sleep stage to awake. Stop waking up by distracting alarm at any random point, but wake up naturally with slowly brightening LED lights and feel refreshed every morning.

</div></div>","Have you ever woke up in the morning in a panic because you immediately realized you were late for class? What about that important meeting with your boss? Your workout class you PROMISED your friend you'd go to?We've been there (more times than we'd like to admit!) and we finally said ENOUGH is enough and developed Spritely. Our goal is to make sure you reach your full potential by waking up, seizing the day and kicking some serious butt.Spritely is the patent-pending, unbeatable wake-up solution guaranteed to get you out of bed in the morning.



With its smart sensor that communicates via Bluetooth with your smartphone, Spritely can detect when you are in and out of bed. The alarm on your phone will go off until you get out of bed or if you get back in. If you turn your phone off, or it dies in the middle of the night, Spritely’s failsafe alarm will go off. The Spritely alarm will also sound if the sensor is removed from the bed, and it will continue to go off until it is put back in place.




Spritely is not just an alarm- it’s a wake-up system and solution that uses a special sensor and corresponding mobile app to guarantee you get out of bed in the morning. It is the only wake-up system that ensures you get out of bed at the time of your alarm. It also wakes you up during the lightest point in your sleep cycle, so you don’t feel groggy in the morning. Spritely collects your sleep data and gives you tips on how you can improve as well.

Our sensor can detect motion, and since there is a certain amount of motion associated with each sleep stage, it derives sleep stages. In the morning, the app presents a graph showing how deep you slept over the course of the night. It also presents some statistics, including your time in bed, time asleep, and time in deep sleep. Taking these all into account, it gives you a comprehensive sleep score out of 100. 

We want to do more than just tell you how you slept, which is what sets us apart from our competitors. Using our app, you can also set goals for improving your sleep score, and Spritely will work with you to achieve those goals. For example, if you make a goal to go to bed within an hour of 10 PM each night and stay up an hour later than the previous night, the app will notify you and help maintain good sleep habits. 

Long term, we hope you will build better sleep habits, and won’t even need to use the alarm. But when you do, it will be the most refreshing wake-up possible, and you’ll never get out of bed a minute late- guaranteed.








The Spritely sensor will detect when you’re in your bed, and it will ring the alarm on your phone until you leave your bed- it will even resume sounding if you try to get back in!



With Spritely, it’s as simple as inserting the thin sensor strip between your mattress and boxspring, plugging it in and hitting the hay!


Thanks to the built-in sleep sensor that sounds your alarm during the lightest stage of your sleep cycle, you will wake up feeling refreshed.



The Spritely sensor connects with the Spritely app on your phone via Bluetooth. The app allows you to set alarms and choose custom tones from your personal music library as well as Soundcloud and Spotify.

Well, now is your chance. Wake up with Spritely to be refreshed and ready to go in the morning!

<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Why the Jolla was a mistake for me</span><br/></p>
</div><div> <p>The system is way too underdeveloped. There a lot of unfixed bugs. But with every update they promised to fixed them, but never really did. There are a ton of ""guides"", explaining how to fix most of the bugs. But I didn't buy a phone to ""hack"" some strange stuff into a console and maybe destroying all I got.</p>
<p>Here are some of the bugs I encounter every day.</p> <ul> <li>Android Apps are freezing when not focused for a while. </li> <li>Native Apps are crashing on a regular basis.</li> <li>Battery Charge is jumping around (30% to 0% or 10% to 20%...).</li>
<li>Logged in Accounts are disconnecting every other day.</li> </ul>
<div>Also, there's no native App for WhatsApp. I'm a student. I do use WhatsApp on a regular basis. The old ""native"" App got users banned, and the Android version is crashing and is often not receiving any messages. So without this I'm missing a lot of important messages from College, Friends and Family.</div>
<div>Instead of fixing the current bugs they knew about, Jolla started developing a Tablet. With this move I feel left alone by them. But since they always promised to fix the bugs, I was waiting. And after a year of waiting? Nothing really changed and I regret the purchase.</div> </div> <div> <h3>So? Where can You help me?</h3> <p>I want to switch to a phone that is more reliable and can drive my everyday communication. So I want to switch to a <b>Blackberry Classic</b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">. I choose this phone, because some of my friends are using it and are really satisfied by it. I had a opportunity to test it a few times and have to say that it just feels better. Apps aren't crashing and there are native Apps for all my needs.</span></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Why I can't buy a better phone myself</h3> <p>As I'm a student, I don't have a lot of money. I'm happy if I am able to pay my rent and get something to eat everyday. I get exited if I have enough money left at the end of a month to go to a pub and get a drink there. So, there currently is no way for me to buy myself a better phone, since the money I had saved went into buying the Jolla.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Can't offer money, but still want to help?</h3>
<h3>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">That's fine. Leave me a positive message, get the word out there, so I can reach more people? That would be awesome too.

</div></div>","Bad decisions were made Hello, my name is Robin and I made a terrible mistake. I was fooled by the false advertisement of Jolla. I didn't know, that by being ""Unlike"" they really just meant ""not working"".
Why the Jolla was a mistake for me
 The system is way too underdeveloped. There a lot of unfixed bugs. But with every update they promised to fixed them, but never really did. There are a ton of ""guides"", explaining how to fix most of the bugs. But I didn't buy a phone to ""hack"" some strange stuff into a console and maybe destroying all I got.
Here are some of the bugs I encounter every day.  Android Apps are freezing when not focused for a while.  Native Apps are crashing on a regular basis. Battery Charge is jumping around (30% to 0% or 10% to 20%...).
Logged in Accounts are disconnecting every other day. 
Also, there's no native App for WhatsApp. I'm a student. I do use WhatsApp on a regular basis. The old ""native"" App got users banned, and the Android version is crashing and is often not receiving any messages. So without this I'm missing a lot of important messages from College, Friends and Family.
Instead of fixing the current bugs they knew about, Jolla started developing a Tablet. With this move I feel left alone by them. But since they always promised to fix the bugs, I was waiting. And after a year of waiting? Nothing really changed and I regret the purchase.   So? Where can You help me? I want to switch to a phone that is more reliable and can drive my everyday communication. So I want to switch to a Blackberry Classic. I choose this phone, because some of my friends are using it and are really satisfied by it. I had a opportunity to test it a few times and have to say that it just feels better. Apps aren't crashing and there are native Apps for all my needs.
    Why I can't buy a better phone myself As I'm a student, I don't have a lot of money. I'm happy if I am able to pay my rent and get something to eat everyday. I get exited if I have enough money left at the end of a month to go to a pub and get a drink there. So, there currently is no way for me to buy myself a better phone, since the money I had saved went into buying the Jolla.
    Can't offer money, but still want to help?

That's fine. Leave me a positive message, get the word out there, so I can reach more people? That would be awesome too. Every little thing to help me here is greatly appreciated.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Avoidance of the supine posture is efficacious for reducing the events of apnea. And the optimal sleep position reduced mild snoring by more than 80%.  </p><p><i>1.Joosten, S.A., et al., Supine position related obstructive sleep apnea in adults: pathogenesis and treatment.

Sleeping on the lateral side not only can stop snoring but also improve sleep quality. Therefore they can have better physical strength to fight for the independence of America. With the long history of  Positional Intervention Therapy, it is commonly recognized by medical community. Other traditional methods include put a pillow or a ball under your back, which make people feel uncomfortable lying on it.</p><p><strong>Why do we Design a Smart Mat?  </strong></p><p>We have tried many traditional methods of positional therapy , such as putting a pillow under the back. It is very uncomfortable and uneasy to fall asleep. In the sleeping, because of this discomfort, it is easy to lie on the back and start to snore again. We hope to invent an automatic device that help you to sleep on the side only when you are snoring, but you can also lie on the back when you don't snore. Yes, this is SOMNOVA.  </p><p><strong>Why SOMNOVA is not a smart pillow?  </strong></p><p>Actually we have made many tests on inflatable pillow. But there are lot of nerves in the head and therefore it is very sensitive. When pushing the head, it is very easy to wake up.  </p><p>On the other hand, it is possible that the airway becomes more narrow when pushing your head. Although you may not snore, but the next morning you may be more tired.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486445419/tdrx1uyi9gfobv1dwx46.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>After more than a year of research and development, we came out with SOMNOVA.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486445432/l8ihzwd4k8iuez4p9fnk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488435210/epgiknfxyoujmacwznis.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>The SOMNOVA System</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486445475/gsjvzu0i2isxp0t00owp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>● One power adapter  </p><p>● One control case (Please put the case 60-70cm away from your head, and the sound reception hole should turn in the direction of your head.)</p><p>● Air tube made of silica gel  </p><p>● One inflatable mat ( formed of two independent air bags )  </p><p>● One cloth cover (There are four fastener in each corner, which can connect with corresponding four fastener in the mat)</p><p> </p><h3>Rewards</h3><p>FUTURE RETAIL PRICE: $580  </p><p>Backers enjoy 80% off!

Don’t forget to contact us for the gift after sharing.Hurry up, 300 quotas only! Featured inFeel free to contact  us, we are happy to help here.Via: service@somnova.com Users' Comments How Does SOMNOVA Work?When snoring is detected, SOMNOVA will rise up gradually and gently, moving your body to a lateral position. As a result, snoring is reduced effectively.Real Time Monitor: When you are asleep, SOMNOVA will monitor your body movements and breathing patterns for the adjustment helping to stop snoring. Two Ways of SettingConsidering different users’ sleeping habits, we have specially conceived two kinds of setting. The Mobile App Why SOMNOVA is so Amazing?Why do People Snore and How Dangerous is it?  Generally speaking, snoring results from the relaxation of the uvula and soft palate. When you are sleeping, those tissues can be relaxed enough to partially block the trachea, resulting in irregular airflow and vibrations. Those vibrations are heard as snoring.    Snoring is an universal reason of sleep deprivation to snorers and those who around them. In addition, snoring can cause daytime drowsiness, irritability, inattention and libido decrease. It is also been suggested that snoring can cause significant psychological and social damage to snoring sufferers. Multiple studies reveal a positive correlation between loud snoring and risk of heart attack (about +34% chance) and stroke (about +67% chance).How do People Feel if They Have Snoring Problems?There are different kinds of snoring patients. In medical science, we define, during sleeping, mild snoring patients will stop breathing 5 times per hour; moderate patients,20 times per hour; and severe patients, 40 times per hour or even more . And each time of breathing stop is longer than 10 seconds.1. Mild snoring patients will feel chest tightness, as in the crowded subway.2. Moderate snoring patients will feel like breathless after climbing stairs.3. Severe snoring patients will appear hypoxia or sudden deathHow SOMNOVA Relieves Snoring?As the studies shown, sleeping on the lateral position instead of lying on the back can reduce snoring effectively.There is a snore monitor and a mini-pump in the gray case placed beside the bed. This mat consists of two airbags. When the case perceives you snores, it will pump the air slowly into one of the two airbags. As one airbag inflates, it gently pushes you to your side and engages your body to remain this position. Then snoring is reduced effectively.

 
The Science of SOMNOVA: The Only Way to a Better Sleep  There are researches found that approximately 25-60% of patients with obstructive sleep apnea are correlated with sleep position. Avoidance of the supine posture is efficacious for reducing the events of apnea. And the optimal sleep position reduced mild snoring by more than 80%.  1.Joosten, S.A., et al., Supine position related obstructive sleep apnea in adults: pathogenesis and treatment. Sleep Med Rev, 2014. 18(1): p. 7-17.2.Lee, J.B., et al., Determining optimal sleep position in patients with positional sleep-disordered breathing using response surface analysis. J Sleep Res, 2009. 18(1): p. 26-35.Snore judgment is key of our technology. SOMNOVA will continually cooperated with medical institution to get more snore sample. This will help our acoustic expert and engineers optimize a more precise snore judgment algorithm. Each time we issue a newly optimized algorithm, users can get it by free updates. Experiments on SOMNOVAWe have done a lot of experiments on SOMNOVA, including the falling test, temperature test, weight test,noise test and clinical test. We make sure SOMNOVA is a reliable and effective production. SOMNOVA really help people to relief snoring and keep people refreshing when they get up. The Design of SOMNOVAIt is simple and easy to use SOMNOVA.  The Birth of SOMNOVAPositional Intervention Therapy During the War of Independence, small cannonballs were sewn into the backs of uniforms to keep soldiers from snoring and alert the enemy. Sleeping on the lateral side not only can stop snoring but also improve sleep quality. Therefore they can have better physical strength to fight for the independence of America. With the long history of  Positional Intervention Therapy, it is commonly recognized by medical community. Other traditional methods include put a pillow or a ball under your back, which make people feel uncomfortable lying on it.Why do we Design a Smart Mat?  We have tried many traditional methods of positional therapy , such as putting a pillow under the back. It is very uncomfortable and uneasy to fall asleep. In the sleeping, because of this discomfort, it is easy to lie on the back and start to snore again. We hope to invent an automatic device that help you to sleep on the side only when you are snoring, but you can also lie on the back when you don't snore. Yes, this is SOMNOVA.  Why SOMNOVA is not a smart pillow?  Actually we have made many tests on inflatable pillow. But there are lot of nerves in the head and therefore it is very sensitive. When pushing the head, it is very easy to wake up.  On the other hand, it is possible that the airway becomes more narrow when pushing your head. Although you may not snore, but the next morning you may be more tired.After more than a year of research and development, we came out with SOMNOVA.The SOMNOVA System● One power adapter  ● One control case (Please put the case 60-70cm away from your head, and the sound reception hole should turn in the direction of your head.)● Air tube made of silica gel  ● One inflatable mat ( formed of two independent air bags )  ● One cloth cover (There are four fastener in each corner, which can connect with corresponding four fastener in the mat) RewardsFUTURE RETAIL PRICE: $580  Backers enjoy 80% off!

As a group of young people with American dreams, in this equal society, we believe that we can eventually be successful by our own efforts. Now we are very close to the success and we really need your support.  Positional therapy is a good snore solution which has a long history. As early as the War of Independence, in order to have a better sleep, cannonballs were sewn to soldiers’ uniforms to keep them sleeping on the side and relieve snoring. Good rest without snoring helped them more energetic to fight for their dreams, the victory in the war and the independence of America.  Somnova is based on this traditional positional therapy and combined with modern science and technology. With Somnova, it is more comfortable and more effective to stop your snoring by helping sleeping on the side.  The workplace is like a battlefield. If you also have an American dream, you need to keep energetic to fight for success just like those soldiers. Or you even don’t know why you are lost in the American selection.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>While we have already contributed our own capital for initial R&amp;D, prototype production, and user application testing, we need the capital necessary for greater production and awareness. The more 3rd Arms in circulation, the more effective we can be in combating the spread of infectious disease. Funding stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial goal to produce the first fleet of 1,000 units: $19,000</li>
<li>Growth phase or 1,001 - 5,750 units : $19,001 - $218,250</li>
<li>Ongoing production of 5,750+: $218,250+</li>
</ul>
<p>We feel that we all bear responsibility in suppressing the spread of disease, particularly novel disease in which we don't have established treatments yet. As such, we make a <u>pledge ourselves to contribute 10% after our ongoing production stage is reached as donations</u> to those that would benefit most from the 3rd Arm,</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a species, we have always leveraged tools to advance our capabilities. Today, the biggest impact we can all make is to reduce the amount of contact we have with each other, whether direct or indirect. By incorporating the 3rd Arm into daily routine, we can reduce community spread of novel viruses, such as Covid-19, to keep our most vulnerable safe and our healthcare system intact.</p>
<p>Your contribution will launch the first wave of the 3rd Arm that will keep you shielded from inevitable everyday contact, as well as your community through contact suppression and added awareness to these silent dangers.</p>
<p>Some common use cases:</p>

<li>Grocery shopping</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge will be to produce enough supply to match demand. Like social distancing, the 3rd Arm is more impactful the more widely adopted it is. Less contact with surfaces means less contact with germs, which leads to less disease.</p>

It was Plato that said, ""necessity is the mother of invention"", and right now it is so alarmingly clear that we need to flatten the curve of the Covid-19 pandemic. The goal of the 3rd Arm project is to reduce germ spread  through the surface-to-human contact required in everyday life. While we can all operate within the guidelines of proper hygiene and social distancing, there are situations that inherently require contact with surfaces. Ultimately, this campaign will produce a tool that:

can push, pull, click, grab, and twist items such as doors, payment portals, ATMs, and other public utility
can be used by left or right-handed people alike
is intuitive and useful for people with all levels of strength and dexterity
is 100% made in America

With your help, we can produce a device that will reduce the spread of disease and become a commonplace safety item that compliments the use of sanitizer gels and wipes.

</div></div>","Due to the spread of new corona-virus infection, masks and disinfectant goods which are in high demand. wE. is a mask case with stylish design that anyone can carry around. Equipped with UV-C LED light that has already acquired the standard, it has an excellent sterilizing effect. Keep the mask clean. Easy to pick up compared to other disinfectant mask cases.

We believe that everyone recognizes the importance of keeping your mask clean. However, can you be sure that your mask is really 'hygienic'?  It is reasonable to say that not many have given it much thought.
wE. is a mask case with sterilizing power by using UV-C LED light. 
But, it is not merely a mask case. 
「with Earth.」
Benefiting from Earth’s blessings, we are, at the same time, exposed to unpredictable disasters and viruses. How can we adapt ourselves to this ever-changing environment?   
We strive to improve the masks that have proven to become a necessity to live on this present Earth. A project that helps further keep daily masks in a hygienic and secure condition to ease our minds, the 'wE.' .

 

Have you ever struggled with where to put your masks in daily life? The answer is wE. 
Reusing masks you put in a pocket or on a table?
Bacteria and germs multiply when a mask is used for a long period of time.  It is not safe to wear such a mask anymore. 
Handling as well as managing masks has become a concern.
In light of invisible bacteria, it is necessary to sterilize your masks, even for reusable ones. 
Why do we need wE. in our daily lives? 
Let's look at the following cases.

Removing your mask when you are dining with your loved ones in restaurants. 
Would you leave it on the table? Stuff it into your bag? 
wE. can keep your mask hygienic. To this day and age, it is not an exaggeration to call this table manners.
 


 

A sunny day.
Driving with a lover.
After taking off the mask inside a car, do you just put it in the bottle holder or drawer?
wE. can keep your mask hygienic. This is a social etiquette showing your care towards your loved one.

 

To set everything in order. Comfortably progressing work smoothly and efficiently in a tidy environment.
When you take off the mask during work, how would you manage it? On the desk? In a bag?
wE. can keep your mask hygienic. This may even be a lifehack.

 

There should be people who feel stressful wearing a mask during daily life.
Let’s have a break without a mask.
Please do not stick your mask into the pocket and wear it again.
wE. can keep your mask hygienic. This can definitely bring comfort to you.

 


Despite age and gender, the fine polished design of wE. fits everyone.

Here comes the time that carrying a mask case is a part of social etiquette.

wE. has 2 colors, Black and White. 
Match your style with your preferred color. 




The UV-C LED in wE. has passed the SGS test, showing that it is equipped with effective sterilizing power. 
Comparing with UV-A and UV-B, UV-C has a wavelength of 200-280nm which is appropriate for sterilization, thus UV-C is commonly used in many sterilizing equipment. 
wE. uses this UV-C in LED form so as to generate strong UV rays that strengthen sterilizing power.

 
Test Content
Bacteria is exposed to 2 UV-C LED lights (3mW*) in wE. mask case for 6 minutes, r results demonstrating high sterilizing power found in UV-C LED light. .

The Keeping Core Band uses AAA batteries and because of the low power consumption it is possible for it to last up to 1 month assuming it takes 3 seconds per vibration and 100 vibrations per day. Do you wear it directly over your skin?We recommend wearing the Keeping Core Band over light clothing to avoid the band scratching the skin. This is especially for people who have sensitive skin. Where exactly is Keeping Core Body worn?For best results, it is recommended to be worn at the top of your stomach, below the belly button. How long should I wear for a day?The longer you wear it, the faster you can lose belly fat. The Keeping Core Band is not a device that gives external stimulus but is intended to induce continuous contraction of the abdomen. If you have a weak abdomen or suffer from back pain, it may be hard to wear it for a long time at first. We recommend that you gradually increase the wearing time.Can vibration be heard by others?We have done a lot of experiments with vibration, and we have reduced the noise as much as possible. Even with a lot of people around, the noise is inconspicuous. However, if worn with light clothing and you are in a quiet place, some people might be able to hear the slight vibration.Would the electromagnetic wave be an issue?The Keeping Core Band is KC certified. Rest assured that there are no electromagnetic waves. Do you think wearing it on your waist will cause me to sweat?Sweating varies from one person to another. The level of sweat or moisture does not affect its function. However, it is recommended to place the Keeping Core Band in a well ventilated place to help it dry properly and to avoid any unwanted smells. PLEASE BACK US The Keeping Core Band is the simplest, easiest way to correct your posture and get rid of excess abdominal fat. Try it to believe!We are ready to deliver our greatest invention to you.",23.0,0,"1 Campaign

<ul>
<li>Occlusion training involves the use of

<li>This pressure is low enough that mean arterial

<li>This pooling of blood in the muscle is not

<ul>
<li>Training at intensities as low as 20% 1RM with
     moderate vascular occlusion results in muscle hypertrophy in as little as

     astronauts (Loenneke 2009)</li>
<li>As little as 3 wk of treadmill walk training
     performed with intermittent BFR results in a 6-8% increase in quadriceps

     in leg press and leg curl 1-RM strength. (Abe 2006)</li>
<li>It has been observed that five sets of knee
     extension resistance exercise at 20% of maximal isometric strength with a
     thigh occlusion pressure of 280 mm Hg results in an acute ninefold
     increase in serum growth hormone (GH). (Pierce 2006)</li>
<li>Aerobic benefits have also been studied. A
     study by Abe et al 2010 demonstrated that a single mode of low
     intensity (40% of VO2max), short-duration (15 min) exercise training with
     BFR can elicit improvements in muscle volume in healthy young subjects.

<p><b>Risks and challenges</b></p>
<p>Before we began this
campaign we spent 5 years developing this project which gives us a fair level
of confidence that should a challenge arise, we are prepared and capable to
overcome it.</p>
<p>We have ordered samples
of our product a number of times, from various suppliers to ensure consistent,
high quality products. Should we be fortunate enough to have our project
funded, we plan to fly overseas to meet our chosen supplier in person to create
a positive relationship with them in the hope that this improves the end
product that you receive.</p>
<p>Our biggest challenge is
the fact that our ideal design involves a number of completely custom parts. We
believe we have suppliers that can fulfil this need, but the need for custom
parts will limit our choice of suppliers and raise our costs. We do have a back
up plan, where we decided which components of the design we could leave
unchanged and still provide a fully functional device.</p>
<p>Overall our suppliers can
provide huge volumes and we hope this Indiegogo project takes off as we
truly believe Occlusion X is the future of strength and rehabilitation and we
have the research to back it up.</p>
<p>Let us know if you have
any questions and we are very keen for all feedback (good or bad) as well as
any potential ideas or modifications that you feel would take this device to
the next level.</p>

     rehabilitation (specifically ACL injuries), the elderly and even
     astronauts (Loenneke 2009)
As little as 3 wk of treadmill walk training
     performed with intermittent BFR results in a 6-8% increase in quadriceps
     and hamstring muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) along with a 7-8% increase
     in leg press and leg curl 1-RM strength. (Abe 2006)
It has been observed that five sets of knee
     extension resistance exercise at 20% of maximal isometric strength with a
     thigh occlusion pressure of 280 mm Hg results in an acute ninefold
     increase in serum growth hormone (GH). (Pierce 2006)
Aerobic benefits have also been studied. A
     study by Abe et al 2010 demonstrated that a single mode of low
     intensity (40% of VO2max), short-duration (15 min) exercise training with
     BFR can elicit improvements in muscle volume in healthy young subjects.
     Aerobic capacity also improved concurrently following the training.
Despite using low mechanical load, low
     intensity vascular restriction training is a potentially effective
     training alternative to traditional high intensity resistance training for
     enhancing bone health in older men. (Karabulut et al 2011)

Risks and challenges
Before we began this
campaign we spent 5 years developing this project which gives us a fair level
of confidence that should a challenge arise, we are prepared and capable to
overcome it.
We have ordered samples
of our product a number of times, from various suppliers to ensure consistent,
high quality products. Should we be fortunate enough to have our project
funded, we plan to fly overseas to meet our chosen supplier in person to create
a positive relationship with them in the hope that this improves the end
product that you receive.
Our biggest challenge is
the fact that our ideal design involves a number of completely custom parts. We
believe we have suppliers that can fulfil this need, but the need for custom
parts will limit our choice of suppliers and raise our costs. We do have a back
up plan, where we decided which components of the design we could leave
unchanged and still provide a fully functional device.
Overall our suppliers can
provide huge volumes and we hope this Indiegogo project takes off as we
truly believe Occlusion X is the future of strength and rehabilitation and we
have the research to back it up.
Let us know if you have
any questions and we are very keen for all feedback (good or bad) as well as
any potential ideas or modifications that you feel would take this device to
the next level.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign
