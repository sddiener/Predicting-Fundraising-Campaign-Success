Years later three craft emerge; created from the salvaged parts; the Nebula, the Aurora and <i>the Comet</i>. Sent into deep space, two of the craft go missing except for the Comet. Seventy years later, two kids find a secret garage and discover their late grandfather was a space explorer for the Navy. He was known as ""Skipper""; pilot in command of the Comet. Through a mysterious device, the kids are hurtled across time and space.

<h3><strong>WHAT'S BETWEEN THE LINES</strong></h3>
<p>The Galactic Comet is an over the top, exciting kids storybook, perfect for bedtime or to just disappear into the galaxy for a while. The story promotes family values; highlighting the respect for elders and taking an interest in their wealth of knowledge and experience. For a child, holding a book and delving into the adventure within is a great imaginative and tactile exercise. That connection is priceless. With this story it's my hope to help strengthen family bonds and inspire children's imaginations.</p>

<h3><strong>About the Author and the Storybook</strong></h3>
<p>I’m a family man of over twenty years and the father of two children. I’ve spent over two decades in product development/marketing and sales. I’m an artist with nearly thirty years’ experience in animation, special effects, 3D design and dubious voice-over work. I enjoy the creative process and developing projects to their completion.</p>
<p>When my Navy veteran grandfather reached the last years of his life, I visited with him and learned more about his incredible life. After he passed, I created a eulogy and poured over 94 years of his life in pictures. It was amazing. Sometimes we don't get to say goodbye to the ones we love, but the time you spent with them is invaluable. Though a kids science fiction fantasy storybook, The Galactic Comet is a tale of two kids learning about their grandfather in ways they never knew and appreciating the man that he is. There's so much more to the people close to us if we only take the time to listen.</p>
<p>Joining in this endeavor allows independent creators to produce art in true free-form. Devoid from corporate thinking and massively funded agendas, stories here can be told with passion and energy. It’s truly exciting when people can come together and be a part of creating something fresh and exciting.</p>

<p>I have operated as a brand executive for over twenty years and have managed the process of many specialized manufacturing supply chains. I bring experience, speed and a successful track record in creative development and production.</p>

<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>There is a target goal of $300 to complete the THIRD Galactic Comet storybook, part THREE of a four part series. The largest portion of the cost is the printing, binding and shipping of the books to investors. Funding will complete Book THREE and it will be shipped in 3rd Quarter 2020. Other funds are needed for hardware and software upgrades to handle the complexities of 3D rendering.</p>

For a child, holding a book and delving into the adventure within is a great imaginative and tactile exercise. That connection is priceless. With this story it's my hope to help strengthen family bonds and inspire children's imaginations.

About the Author and the Storybook
I’m a family man of over twenty years and the father of two children. I’ve spent over two decades in product development/marketing and sales. I’m an artist with nearly thirty years’ experience in animation, special effects, 3D design and dubious voice-over work. I enjoy the creative process and developing projects to their completion.
When my Navy veteran grandfather reached the last years of his life, I visited with him and learned more about his incredible life. After he passed, I created a eulogy and poured over 94 years of his life in pictures. It was amazing. Sometimes we don't get to say goodbye to the ones we love, but the time you spent with them is invaluable. Though a kids science fiction fantasy storybook, The Galactic Comet is a tale of two kids learning about their grandfather in ways they never knew and appreciating the man that he is. There's so much more to the people close to us if we only take the time to listen.
Joining in this endeavor allows independent creators to produce art in true free-form. Devoid from corporate thinking and massively funded agendas, stories here can be told with passion and energy. It’s truly exciting when people can come together and be a part of creating something fresh and exciting.

I have operated as a brand executive for over twenty years and have managed the process of many specialized manufacturing supply chains. I bring experience, speed and a successful track record in creative development and production.



Book ONE and TWO of The Galactic are a success and enjoyed by many; we look forward to fantastic things with Book THREE!

What We Need & What You Get
There is a target goal of $300 to complete the THIRD Galactic Comet storybook, part THREE of a four part series. The largest portion of the cost is the printing, binding and shipping of the books to investors. Funding will complete Book THREE and it will be shipped in 3rd Quarter 2020. Other funds are needed for hardware and software upgrades to handle the complexities of 3D rendering.",35.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>Since my Underglow Comics publishing company launched in September 2020,  I've published 9 comic books, including issues of Vampocalypse and Jungle Captive, with many more titles on the way. I am the writer, artist and colorist on all of my titles, occasionally also featuring guest cover artists. I also publish my Model Behavior stories as webcomics on my Patreon page, where I have produced an issue each month since its initial release there in May 2021.</p>
<p>Primarily these comic books have been sold through Kickstarter campaigns, where they have been extremely successful, especially Jungle Captive. And while I have run an Indiegogo campaign before, at the end of last year, I was still relatively new to the platform, and to be honest I didn't really know what I was doing! Now, after selling in the region of 10,000 comics, I'm more than ready for any future challenges, and I want to share my little comics universe with the Indiegogo audience.</p>

<p>I've selected the first issues of my three titles Vampocalypse, Jungle Captive and Model Behavior for this Indiegogo campaign, so you can all get an idea of what my titles are like. I'll probably launch a similar Indiegogo campaign in a couple of months for my second issues.</p>

<p>Gary Parkin has been publishing his own comics since the age of 14, when he used to draw stories about superheroes and fluffy animals, and photocopy the comics in his dad's office, before selling them through the back of comics magazines. Since then he's had a long career producing advertising artwork, storyboards, and commissions of sci-fi characters. During the coronavirus lockdown of 2020 he was temporarily furloughed from his day job, and used the time to start creating full-color comics for the first time. He has since been able to quit his job to become a full-time comic artist and publisher. In the last 12 months he has written and drawn over a dozen full-length comics, as well as drawing variant covers for BAD Press Comics, Totally Rad Comics and The NextArt Verlag.</p>

<div>Because of this everyone now wants to live in one of the two places still left standing, Russia or Africa.  Because of the rich amount of natural resources most people chose Africa but this leaves Africa open to over population, tribal conflict, corruption and crime.  A notorious gun runner by the name of ""Siege"" is extremely passionate about the well being of Africa so with his state of the art sophisticated weapons and the support of his new allies the Naija Congo Army (NCA)  he enforces his own dominance by protecting the borders of Africa by a force of arms so no one he deems an outsider can get in.  </div>

<div>The Naija Congo Army (NCA) have their agenda too.  Funded by numerous rich organizations and unbeknownst to Siege the NCA want to test out a new form of technology on the African population called the ""Hard Wired"" chip. This chip would help to keep track of and monitor every citizen of Africa but this is only the initial cover story. The chip also has a defect.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The chip reacts to different types of bodies in three various ways, one is making the host paralyzed and can even cause death but the other rare reaction is giving the host super abilities that enhance their potential which ultimately gives them super powers. Many people don't agree with this chip but in this new world very few can stop it and the theory needs to be tested on somebody.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Siege is unaware of this plot by the NCA but the NCA are also unaware like many others that Siege is a high end gun runner on the top of the gun running business only because of his very unique weapons which were given to him by the very same aliens called the poraxians who visited earth before.  </div>

<ul> <li>By supporting this project you will be helping us to deliver the finished product more efficiently so we can print up enough comics and distribute to independent book stores and comic stores alike (maybe even a store near you).  We have already put our own money towards getting top quality artwork from different artists involved in the project but with your help we can use what you give to print up a generous amount that we know we can sell at comic conventions, online and in stores.</li>

Before you know it we had lots of other people telling us what they would like to see in a comic book character themselves so we are using this to not only fulfill our own dreams but the dreams of others who support us.</li> <li>We've never done a crowd funding project before as we are used to just saving up our own money from our day jobs to pay for everything but due to other expenses like the price of comic conventions, artists and other things related to comics we decided to ask for a little help from our existing supporters as well as new ones who like independent comic work.</li> <li>We are very approachable and you can even meet us in person at places like Greenwich market where we trade every week from Tuesday to Friday.  We actually like meeting new people face to face and while we would love to get your financial support we would love to see you in person too so you can see exactly what it is that we do.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>We have made sure that all of the possible risks are covered such as printing issues which is the only thing that could go wrong at the moment and the possibility of changing the artist we use.  W<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">e have more than one printer in mind to use if we are unable to use the one planned and we also have other artists on stand by as well as ourselves who can still deliver and good product (see issue 1 and 2 for examples)</span></p>

We have now increased the goal to £2,500 to help go toward funding issue 4 as well as the current efforts on issue 3 so come on people, help us push our goal even further, any amount is welcome and every contributor will receive a reward.
Short Summary The All Knightz:  We are a group of independent artists from London consisting of writers, graphic artists and animators with a big passion for comics.






 Hard Wired Revolution is a comic book story that has been written like a political thriller with elements of science fiction and aimed at anyone from the age of 10 years and above.


       


In the year 2089 Africa has become to new super power after a mutant outbreak which happened years before leaving most of planet earth in ruins.  
Because of this everyone now wants to live in one of the two places still left standing, Russia or Africa.  Because of the rich amount of natural resources most people chose Africa but this leaves Africa open to over population, tribal conflict, corruption and crime.  A notorious gun runner by the name of ""Siege"" is extremely passionate about the well being of Africa so with his state of the art sophisticated weapons and the support of his new allies the Naija Congo Army (NCA)  he enforces his own dominance by protecting the borders of Africa by a force of arms so no one he deems an outsider can get in.  




The Naija Congo Army (NCA) have their agenda too.  Funded by numerous rich organizations and unbeknownst to Siege the NCA want to test out a new form of technology on the African population called the ""Hard Wired"" chip. This chip would help to keep track of and monitor every citizen of Africa but this is only the initial cover story. The chip also has a defect.  

The chip reacts to different types of bodies in three various ways, one is making the host paralyzed and can even cause death but the other rare reaction is giving the host super abilities that enhance their potential which ultimately gives them super powers. Many people don't agree with this chip but in this new world very few can stop it and the theory needs to be tested on somebody.

Siege is unaware of this plot by the NCA but the NCA are also unaware like many others that Siege is a high end gun runner on the top of the gun running business only because of his very unique weapons which were given to him by the very same aliens called the poraxians who visited earth before.  

With a plot line full of deception and twists along with action, aliens, science fiction and more, Hard Wired Revolution will be kicking into its third episode.

     


 By supporting this project you will be helping us to deliver the finished product more efficiently so we can print up enough comics and distribute to independent book stores and comic stores alike (maybe even a store near you).  We have already put our own money towards getting top quality artwork from different artists involved in the project but with your help we can use what you give to print up a generous amount that we know we can sell at comic conventions, online and in stores.
   What We Need & What You Get   We are seeking to raise £1500 in total to print up copies of this particular comic, this will include the price of shipping. Every backer that gives £5 or more will receive something in return ranging from wallpapers for your phone or computer to posters and comics that we have made and of course issue 3. We are determined, and even if we do not reach our goal we will still put all of what we receive to printing the comic as we have already proven to everyone including ourselves that we love what we do and you only need to see issue 1 and 2 to see this.    The Impact   When we first started this project we focused on characters we didn't see much of as children, black characters, women characters, & characters with actual believable back stories. Before you know it we had lots of other people telling us what they would like to see in a comic book character themselves so we are using this to not only fulfill our own dreams but the dreams of others who support us. We've never done a crowd funding project before as we are used to just saving up our own money from our day jobs to pay for everything but due to other expenses like the price of comic conventions, artists and other things related to comics we decided to ask for a little help from our existing supporters as well as new ones who like independent comic work. We are very approachable and you can even meet us in person at places like Greenwich market where we trade every week from Tuesday to Friday.  We actually like meeting new people face to face and while we would love to get your financial support we would love to see you in person too so you can see exactly what it is that we do.    Risks & Challenges We have made sure that all of the possible risks are covered such as printing issues which is the only thing that could go wrong at the moment and the possibility of changing the artist we use.  We have more than one printer in mind to use if we are unable to use the one planned and we also have other artists on stand by as well as ourselves who can still deliver and good product (see issue 1 and 2 for examples)
We also have made sure that we've written up enough material to keep this going with this story continuously for years to come, currently we have written 30 issues in total.  Everything has been done ahead of time so no matter how it turns out this will be a success that we will release anytime between January and March.

<b>Christopher De La Garza,</b> im Februar 1988 geboren, schrieb schon früh Aphorismen, Kurzgeschichten und Essays über philosophische und gesellschaftskritische Szenarien. Begonnen mit der Vision einen Roman in Buchform über eine Gesellschaft an einem fiktiven Ort in der Zukunft zu schreiben, an dem die Menschen nur noch Symptome bekämpfen statt die Ursachen der Probleme zu erkennen, entwickelte sich die anfangs rein dystopische Geschichte mithilfe von <b>Sascha Grusche</b><span>, geboren im März 1986 zu einer bebilderten Geschichte. Text und Bild, Dystopie und Utopie vereint in einer Graphic Novel. Sascha, Physiker und Künstler lebt, arbeitet und promoviert in Weingarten, illustriert und gestaltet die Geschichte und das Konzept maßgeblich mit. Seine wissenschaftlichen Erfindungen, welche in der Graphic Novel ebenfalls Einzug halten und sein Hintergrundwissen über klassische Kunst verstärken die kontrastreiche Welt von Hemispheres inhaltlich und visuell um ein vielfaches. <b>Simon Pape</b>, geboren im Dezember 1987, Graffiti Fine Artist, Illustrator und Designer entwickelte ursprünglich die Graffiti-Motive, welche von der jungen Streetart Aktivistin und Protagonistin Selah Ray innerhalb der Graphic Novel gesprüht werden sollten. Mittlerweile ist er seit August 2013 ein Teil des Hemispheres-Teams und als Concept Artist und Designer maßgeblich an der Gestaltung der Welt von Hemispheres beteiligt. </span>

HEMISPHERES 'Corpus Separatum' ist der erste von drei Bänden, geschrieben von Christopher De La Garza, gezeichnet von Sascha Grusche mit Concept Art & Design von Simon Pape.
Wir benötigen 5.000€ um in folgende Posten zu investieren:

2.000 € decken die Miete für das Orange Lab in Berlin ab
1.000 € decken die Kosten für das Programm vom 03. bis 18. Oktober ab
1.000 € decken die Kosten für die Produktion des Doku-Films ab
1.000 € decken die Kosten für die Produktion der Exponate ab





DIE LOCATION. Raum für neues Denken - Schnittstelle zur Öffentlichkeit: das ORANGE LAB in Berlin. Schon immer ein Ort für Innovationen: was in den 60er Jahren der Serversaal von IBM war, ist 2013 ein Ort für neues Denken, Diskurs und Disput. Das ORANGE LAB ist eine Schnittstelle zur Öffentlichkeit – sowohl im architektonischen als auch im inhaltlichen Sinne.

Bürgerlicher Name: David (hebr.: geliebter Gottes) Shakara (pidgin English: Angeben) Buddhistischer Name: Dvarakadisha (sanskr.: Herr der Tore) Dasa (sanskr.: Diener, Sklave, Devote/Anhänger) - sieht sich gezwungen aus der friedlichen Abgeschiedenheit seines Klosters zurück in seine verhasste Heimat Hierosolyma zurückzukehren. Dort trifft er auf eine Gesellschaft, die dem Untergang geweiht scheint.

Selah (hebr. innehalten und nachdenken) Ray (en. Lichtstrahl) - ist eine junge provokante Streetart-Aktivistin, die mit ihrer Kunst bei den Menschen Bewusstsein für die bestehenden Probleme in der Stadt und in der Gesellschaft schaffen will.

Isaac (hebr. Gott lächelt) - ist ein ehemaliger Polizist und Kollege Davids. Seit einem Arbeitsunfall ist er an den Rollstuhl gefesselt und fristet, vom Staat im Stich gelassen, sein Dasein außerhalb der Gesellschaft - geprägt von Enttäuschung und Resignation.

Christopher De La Garza, im Februar 1988 geboren, schrieb schon früh Aphorismen, Kurzgeschichten und Essays über philosophische und gesellschaftskritische Szenarien. Begonnen mit der Vision einen Roman in Buchform über eine Gesellschaft an einem fiktiven Ort in der Zukunft zu schreiben, an dem die Menschen nur noch Symptome bekämpfen statt die Ursachen der Probleme zu erkennen, entwickelte sich die anfangs rein dystopische Geschichte mithilfe von Sascha Grusche, geboren im März 1986 zu einer bebilderten Geschichte. Text und Bild, Dystopie und Utopie vereint in einer Graphic Novel. Sascha, Physiker und Künstler lebt, arbeitet und promoviert in Weingarten, illustriert und gestaltet die Geschichte und das Konzept maßgeblich mit. Seine wissenschaftlichen Erfindungen, welche in der Graphic Novel ebenfalls Einzug halten und sein Hintergrundwissen über klassische Kunst verstärken die kontrastreiche Welt von Hemispheres inhaltlich und visuell um ein vielfaches. Simon Pape, geboren im Dezember 1987, Graffiti Fine Artist, Illustrator und Designer entwickelte ursprünglich die Graffiti-Motive, welche von der jungen Streetart Aktivistin und Protagonistin Selah Ray innerhalb der Graphic Novel gesprüht werden sollten. Mittlerweile ist er seit August 2013 ein Teil des Hemispheres-Teams und als Concept Artist und Designer maßgeblich an der Gestaltung der Welt von Hemispheres beteiligt. 

Bei HEMISPHERES prallt die spirituelle Abgeschiedenheit eines buddhistischen Klosters auf das materialistische Chaos einer Megastadt. Wir verbinden moderne Wissenschaft mit klassischer Kunst, um den Betrachter zum Nachdenken über unser gegenwärtiges, gesellschaftliches Leben anzuregen. Wir wollen einen tieferen Diskurs anstoßen, der sich durch viele Ebenen unseres Lebens zieht - ökologisch, ökonomisch und sozial. Bei unseren Lesern soll die Frage entstehen, welche Veränderungen schon heute notwendig sind, bevor es für einen Wandel zu spät ist. Dazu schaffen wir mit unseren Veranstaltungen interdisziplinäre Ideen- und Projekträume, verbinden Menschen miteinander und entwickeln dabei gezielt Inhalte und mögliche Lösungsansätze für die gesellschaftlichen und globalen Herausforderungen des 21. Jahrhunderts.



Die Geschichte von HEMISPHERES erzählt die utopisch/dystopische Trilogie von einer scheinbar aufstrebenden Gesellschaft in der fiktiven Stadt Hierosolyma (gr. hieros ""heilig"", lat. solum ""Land"", hebr. Yerushaláyim), welche mitten in der Phase ihres moralischen und physischen Verfalls steckt.
Das erste Kapitel der Graphic Novel heißt CORPUS SEPARATUM. Der Mönch Dvarakadisha Dasa begibt sich in die Stadt um seinem erkrankten Mönchsbruder ein dringend benötigtes Medikament zu beschaffen.

Hierosolyma ist eine hektische Megacity, laut und überfüllt - irgendwo in Südostasien.

<p>Ship Jumper is a free, online, +18 homoerotic webcomic starring Piper, an enthusiastic sailor in the navy of his country of Clochette. They are at war with the country of Lymeswold, and after their ship is destroyed in a battle, Piper and his Captain, Ellis, find themselves stranded on a seemingly deserted island. Besides having to fight for their survival, Piper soon discovers that the island is full of strange and mysterious creatures, as well as an unexpected fellow survivor from the wreck with a particular interest in him...</p>

<p><strong>The Book-</strong></p>
<p>I’m hoping to utilize Indiegogo as a pre-ordering system for the Ship Jumper book! When I started this comic I always envisioned it as a physical book in the end. I like owning comics and reading something that’s tangible in my hands. I currently generate no revenue off of Ship Jumper. I’m doing it 100% for the LOVE baby~ Reaching this funding goal will allow me to print a high quality run of the comic which I hope to debut at the MOCCA festival in NYC this April.</p>

<p><strong>Okay, so just how rad is this book going to be?</strong></p>
<p>Super rad! This book will include both Volumes One and Two of Ship Jumper combined into one 110 page ‘omnibus’ edition! That’s 110 full color pages!<br/>It will be printed on matte coated 85 lb paper in color for the interior pages and have a luxurious matte finish 10pt cover.

</div></div>","What is Ship Jumper?
Ship Jumper is a free, online, +18 homoerotic webcomic starring Piper, an enthusiastic sailor in the navy of his country of Clochette. They are at war with the country of Lymeswold, and after their ship is destroyed in a battle, Piper and his Captain, Ellis, find themselves stranded on a seemingly deserted island. Besides having to fight for their survival, Piper soon discovers that the island is full of strange and mysterious creatures, as well as an unexpected fellow survivor from the wreck with a particular interest in him...

Piper- post wreck

The Book-
I’m hoping to utilize Indiegogo as a pre-ordering system for the Ship Jumper book! When I started this comic I always envisioned it as a physical book in the end. I like owning comics and reading something that’s tangible in my hands. I currently generate no revenue off of Ship Jumper. I’m doing it 100% for the LOVE baby~ Reaching this funding goal will allow me to print a high quality run of the comic which I hope to debut at the MOCCA festival in NYC this April.

Okay, so just how rad is this book going to be?
Super rad! This book will include both Volumes One and Two of Ship Jumper combined into one 110 page ‘omnibus’ edition! That’s 110 full color pages!It will be printed on matte coated 85 lb paper in color for the interior pages and have a luxurious matte finish 10pt cover. So a really nice, high quality book on par with trade paperbacks you’d find at your local comic store.

But OF COURSE there will also be fabulous book-only extras!
The extras-
     -A reworked and COMPLETELY re-colored Volume One!As you may have noticed on the comic site, many of the Volume One pages posted now are not the originals but have some tweaked and updated art. Volume One will continue to be available in B&W online, but it will be presented with more redrawn art and in color ONLY in the print edition. Check out the example before & after panels below~

Old art vs New art
     -Extended scenes!Two scenes, one from Volume One and one from Volume Two have an additional page added! Both extended scenes are rated +18 and will never appear online.
     -A 10 page BONUS comic!10 pages of pure silly, sexy, fluff featuring our three heroes- Piper, Ellis and Rhinston. This +18 bonus comic will ONLY be available in the book and will never appear online.I don’t want to give too much away, but here's one of the sketches~

     -Extra sketches, scripts from 2 short cut scenes that didn’t quite make it into Volume 1 or 2, plus some behind the scenes work in progress thumbnails and pictures.

The Rewards-
Pledge of $20- Book level-This is the basic level which will get you a copy of the book in all its glory!(please add $5 for shipping outside of the US)
Pledge of $35- Bonus level-This will get you the book signed and with a sketch on the inside cover! Also includes a pre-order only bookmark.
Pledge of $50- Special Edition level-This level includes the book, signed and with a sketch, in a special edition slipcover jacket featuring new art AND your name (or prefered handle) printed in the book in the ‘Special Thanks’ section! This is a pre-order only special edition and will not be available after this phase is finished.
Pledge of $75- Plushie Edition level-This includes everything from all the other levels PLUS a hand made by me Piper Plushie! I’m really excited about this one and I’ve been wanting to make it for awhile.

<h3>The Book</h3>
<p>Hi! Jared Barel here from Loaded Barrel Studios and the artist and writer from our forthcoming original graphic novel GREY. Part sci-fi, part horror, GREY is the story of a small town cop who must go on the hunt for the alien that is terrorizing his town. Shot with live actors on set, GREY has the look of a comic combined with the cinematic feel of a movie. GREY is a 116 page full color graphic novel with a foreword by the Eisner Award winning writer of RETURN OF THE DAPPER MEN, Jim McCann. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>The book is 100% complete. All we are looking for now is help to cover the cost of printing. We'd like to bring more Loaded Barrel Studios projects to the world, including the completion of the first Brielle and the Horror full length graphic novel, but we need a little help making this final push to get GREY to the New York Comic Con and on shelves in comic stores everywhere. Obviously, it would be nice to raise the complete funds to cover all of the printing costs, but truthfully, every dollar will help. One way or another, this book is getting printed, so rest assured that every dollar you pledge will go directly toward that goal, even if we don't raise all of the funding that we're looking for here - this book will be printed.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The book is done. The distribution deals are in place. All that's left is a little printing help! </p>

Hello.  Thanks for taking the time to read this.  I also hope you will contribute to my 
project and also share this with social media.  I really could use the help.
I hope you will back me with my ideas.  This would mean so much to me to be able 
to follow my dreams.  I work hard and will not disappoint if you give me a chance to 
show you what I can do.  


 The Black Jack is a new comic with original script and artwork by Alister Lee. Also
helping with editing is Sevgi Kahverengi.
The first volume One shot has 41 finished pages and the story is to continue with
nine more story lines.  This first story is about a young girl seeking revenge as her 
entire family was killed by a gang of outlaws. The story is set in the old west in a 
small desert city in Arizona. Life was though in the old west and she had to hide her
identity as a girl so she pretends to be a boy. She learns all she can about surviving
the times. Her fear and anger is always present.

What she finds out though that this isn't just her fight. Evil forces are also after the
 outlaw gangs who must pay for their earthly sins! There are many twists and turns 
to this western fantasy comic.   What We Need & What You Get I'am seeking help to further write, draw and produce the next nine story lines.
I need $10,000 to continue to work full time creating this. I also need the money
to help get a website set up for digital  publishing.
Thank you in advance for your interest and for pledging your support!

<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Weregeek is a comic strip that has been running online for over five years.  At its heart, it's a comic about geeks and geek culture, highlighting the power of imagination as one seemingly ""normal"" guy called Mark learns to love all things nerdy.  Roleplaying games, LARP, anime, cosplay, miniatures battles and many other forms of geekdom are explored in great detail... for those unfamiliar with the story, here's a glimpse of what you might find in this book:</span></span></h3>

</h3>
<h3>The Book:</h3>
<p>Why would you want to buy a book when you can read the comic online? Well, other than the lovely feel of a real physical book in one's hands, there's a TON of extra content packed into this book that ISN'T available online! There's production art, big splash images, author commentary, 8 never-before-seen strips, and a foreword by Tarol Hunt, the artist and writer behind another fine geek comic - <a href=""http://www.goblinscomic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Goblins</a>. And, as though that wasn't enough, I've also managed to pack an exclusive <strong>6-page</strong> story into the book!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Book 4 Details at a glance:</p>
<ul>
<li>104 pages, full color art throughout</li>
<li>Durable gloss cover, perfect bound </li>
<li>Format: 10"" x 8.5""</li>
<li>Over 12 pages of extra content, including the 6-page bonus story </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>So what's the deal?:</h3>
<p>While Weregeek has been published on the internet regularly since 2006, my first book came out in 2008 Since then, I've published two more books.  All of the money for printing costs comes out of my own pocket, and that means putting several thousand dollars worth of debt on my credit card, *<em>every year</em>*.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We've tried doing pre-orders in the past, but they were always problematic. Not only was our store software just not up to the task, but it took a long time to get orders sent out using Canada Post. US Customs also seems to be very picky about letting things in, even for printed materials.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This time, I will be shipping all of the books out of the United States. This means that I can offer shipping for much cheaper, even for International orders, but it also means that there's a much lower chance that things will get lost or caught up at the border!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What YOU get out of this:</h3>
<p>In addition to preorders of the book itself, we're offering a LOT of cool incentives to entice you to jump on our book-printing bandwagon!  First of all there's a special 2-page PDF Weregeek story that has never appeared before in any form (neither on the website or in any of the books), exclusive only to backers!  All donations of 8 dollars or more will receive this PDF as a digital download.  Then there's the books themselves, of course, which we're offering at reduced shipping costs, especially if you order the multiple book sets.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then there's the really exciting stuff:  Weregeek Poetry Swag, custom sketches, original artwork used in producing the book, one-of-a-kind weregeek sculptures... Want me to NPC at your next game? I'll do it! Want me to RUN you a game over Skype? That's also something I can do!  And if you want a combination of things that doesn't appear in any one perk, you can email me to make arrangements!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The print cost (including shipping from China) for Book 4 will be $4250. Plus I need to pay brokerage fees for customs, and pay to have it transported from the port in Vancouver to my office in Alberta. On top of that, I will also have to cover taxes on all money earned, as well as fees charged by IndieGoGo. The final estimated cost for all of this is around $5000, which is the goal I've set.  If we don't make the goal, fear not!  All orders will be honored.  However, if there's enough of a response, and we actually meet or beat that goal, we have a number of special rewards planned for all backers that we'll reveal as the campaign goes along, so remember to check back for updates!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If this happens, I also want to let you know where the extra money will go.  Doing the last book was a lesson in just how out-of-date my computer system is, and I'm in desperate need of an upgrade.  Not only will this make it possible for me to upgrade from Photoshop 7 to the latest version, but a better system means that I will be able to start up weekly UStreams again! (My current system just can't handle running the current UStream software + Photoshop at the same time).</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Shipping</h3>
<p>Shipping for U.S. supporters has been included in the price of each perk. For non-US supporters, a small additional charge is listed below the perk to help cover the extra cost of shipping. Please make sure to include this cost in your contribution, or your order can't be shipped to you!</p>

away at Burning Man. It's a collection of strips about... polar bear temps,
black holes in language, strange hovering artifacts, racing snails, festival
dawns, selfish genes, a caveman who dreams of aeroplanes, why sex is like ice
skating, why spaceships make me cry, and whatever is currently making my head

<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p></div>","Hi, I'm Deirdre. I've been doing
my comic Wasted Epiphanies (http://wastedepiphanies.com)
since 2006, when I put together a little 12-page photocopied minicomic to give
away at Burning Man. It's a collection of strips about... polar bear temps,
black holes in language, strange hovering artifacts, racing snails, festival
dawns, selfish genes, a caveman who dreams of aeroplanes, why sex is like ice
skating, why spaceships make me cry, and whatever is currently making my head
explode. 
I have a new 40-page A5
collection ready to go. 
What's in it? All the web strips since last
October, and several which will only appear in the print version. Some because
they're the wrong format (landscape), some because they're TOO HOT FOR THE
INTERNETS due to naked people and/or bad behaviour. 
What does it look like? That's the cover up there.
Inside it's in glorious colour. 
Colour printing is really
expensive. Yes,
I know, and it'd be cheaper to do a print run in black and white, but I don't
want the experience of reading the comic in print to be less good than it would
be on the web; if possible, I want it to be better. It's great to be able to reach people through a website,
but books as physical objects are still important. 
Even so, I'd been thinking doing
a colour collection would be way out of my price range. Then I checked with my
college printers, and the cost of a print run went from ""don't even think
about it"" to ""ouch, that's quite expensive, but... hmmm...""
But. I am astonishingly skint - I've
just moved to London and started an MA. When I was doing little photocopied
minicomics, I could just print off a batch of them myself and ignore the cost.
This is not just a little photocopied minicomic, and stumping up the whole
printing cost in advance and hoping to break even eventually would be... painful.
There have to be better ways for starving artists to do these things. I believe
that. Please help prove me right. 
If I don't make my total, I'll
still do the print run, so all contributors will get their copies. But if you
help me cover the whole cost, you'll know that you helped me sleep at night. 
In the event that I go over the
total (wouldn't that be cool?), I'll print more copies! (Added later: I never thought I actually would go over the total, but now I have - thank you all so much. If this keeps going past the cost of a print run of 150, which I think is the most the small-press market will support, I'll put anything further towards my web hosting bills and make the site advertising-free.)
 
What are you paying for?
At the subsidised printers at my
college, a print run of 100 books will cost about £300. (As I said, this is
incredibly cheap as colour printing goes.) (And it turns out this is the minimum you can ask for on this site anyway.)

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>My name is Clarissa and I am the creator of
LifeUnexpected.  I am a student going to
a community to become a Graphic Design and Illustrator. I also work as a
illustrator for a children’s book company. I completed 2 books recently, called
“Gimme Will Not Get It” and “Penny Mae Pigsnout: Detective Extraordinaire.”</p>
<p>I have been drawing since I was a young child and I always
wanted to make sci-fi adventure comic books and even animations. I loved seeing
the different races and species from other planets. The clearfully designed
battle ships and futuristic cities that blow my mind away. There are a lot of
inspirational movies, comics, and books that really inspire me, such as: STAR
WARS, IRobot, Chronicles of Riddick, AVATAR, Final Fantasy games, Men In Black,
Prometheus, District 9, Hunger Games, oh gee and so so much more!</p>
<p>I already have my comic online over the computer in a site
called Comic Fury, so then you must be wondering why do I want to print out the
comic? Well, some people not only like to read comics over the computer but
they also appreciate a psychical copy in their hands. This campaign is
important to me because I want to share my comic with everyone, so I have this
satisfaction of them enjoying what I have produced. </p>
<p>All your donations would greatly help me in my pursuits!</p>

<p>Here’s a little intro into my comic chapter 1: In the beginning, the
universe was a vase open space, filled with many galaxies and many planets with

<p>Five planets that were near by each other formed a perfect

Antares. Unfortuantely, the leader of Taji did not want to continue their

<p>The leaders of the planets are: Earth Leader: Ahmose, Taji

<p>Earth: Is a diverse planet, different species from the other

My name is Nicole Marie Guiniling and I’m the founder of Ad Astra Comix. Ad Astra is a website that promotes political and historical comic books, and has recently stepped, albeit with shakey legs, into production, distribution, and publishing.
Over the next 40 days, I'm here on IndieGoGo to promote the re-mastering of ""100 Year Rip-Off: The Real History of British Columbia."" It’s a graphic history of the province that was first published in 1971. That makes it the oldest ""Graphic History"" on record in Canada. 
 
THE COMIC: 100 Year Rip-Off
In July 1971, 100 Year Rip-Off was printed as an 8-page tabloid-sized insert in the counter-culture newspaper, Socialist Youth. It was produced in response to festivities celebrating 100 years of British Columbia's time as a Canadian province. When I first looked through it 40 years later, I was holding a photocopy of a photocopy--after four decades out of print, it was unlikely that too many originals were still around.
 
Pages were creased, graphics were scarred, and the text was messy, but I loved it. What a wonderful documentation--and piece, in and of itself--of B.C. history! I just knew that if the work were re-issued, there would be others like me who would want to see it.
 
In cooperation with the original artist, Bob Altwein, Ad Astra Comix is re-releasing 100 Year Rip-Off for a new generation of readers. The original work has been re-mastered and re-formatted into a black-and-white, 30-page comic book--the same size as your garden-variety Marvel or DC comic.
 
Ad Astra Comix is already at the presses, ready to begin printing.... but in order to get 100 Year Rip-Off into comic shops across Canada, we need costs to be as low as possible.
 
The Pledges and the Perks...
For as little as $7 you can get a copy of 100 Year Rip-Off mailed, with a protective board and bag, right to your doorstep--no extra shipping fee required. Next is our “Pay It Forward” pledge. That’s where, for $25, you get one copy for yourself, two to pass along to friends, co-workers or classmates, and a poster-sized copy of the map included in the book – which details the names and locations of much of what is mentioned in the comic. The map is great to have for classrooms, studies and bookstores; it's also a great place to start if you’re from out-of-province and need some orientation before diving in!
 

 
 
No complicated combinations. No useless swag or perks. This is truly about coming together and supporting a long-lost political and historical comic that needs--deserves--a new lease on life.

Do you have comics stuck in a drawer? Let's publish them! Hello! I'm Alex Moura and I'm the founder of Comicflip, the platform that will help authors and artists to get their comics in the hands of thousands in a way that's honest and fun, with loyal readers and fans 24/7. Comicflip will be the best place to be to publish and read comics: a truly direct connection between authors and readers. Let's make the world a better place for comics authorsIt's hard to make a living from comics in the traditional publishing business, because the authors only keep about 8% of the selling price. Yes, you read that right: just about 8%. The big digital gatekeepers (like Google, Amazon, Apple, among others) are doing the same, keeping from 30% to 50% of all earnings, and at the same time retaining the new readers for themselves: the authors have no contact at all with their own audience. Together we can change it!With Comicflip, authors will keep 95% of the profit. Pretty cool, huh?Imagine what it feels like to wake up in the morning to lots of appreciation on the new comic you posted, or to hundreds of sales that came in overnight from readers all around the world. Imagine finally making the impact and the income you know you deserve. This is not a crazy dream, it's a new reality of the comics business. All authors should have a chance to be found and to thrive, and you can help to make it possible by supporting Comicflip.Your fans are all around the world. With Comicflip you will reach them.Comicflip will be global, available initially in English, French, Portuguese and Spanish (more to come), and you can also have your stories professionally translated to other languages by our passionate translation team and reach even more people. Isn’t this cool? 
Dedicated to comics
Comicflip is nothing more than the result of the desire to make a difference, to help comics artists across the planet to grow, and we've been working really hard to build Comicflip in a way both authors and readers will love to use.
Reading comics on Comicflip is great: just flip through the story in full screen, without distractions, ads or clumsy interfaces, making it really cool to read comics on any device: tablets, phablets, smartphones, desktops, notebooks, you name it!


It takes only 3 steps to publish on Comicflip:



Type the title


Add the images


Set the price


and... That’s it: free, quick and simple.





Information is power

The author's Dashboard is your analytics and data on your comics, where you will see the number of sales, visits, and referrals to your stories. Additionally, you can see where your readers come from and in which country your stories are successful.





Comics are passion
Most comics artists get started creating stories because they need to express themselves. They're looking to not being chained to an office desk and don't want to be locked into someone else's schedule, and what they really want is to have a better life doing something they love, something they are born to do, and to be happy and successful doing it. 
Comicflip will bring, closer to you, the people who really care about what you do, no matter whether you call it bande dessinée, manga, graphic novel or história em quadrinhos: we share the same passion.


Let's make this happen!

Did you enjoy this idea? I hope so. If you did, contribute now and, of course, share it with your friends. By supporting us, you are not just a collaborator, you are a creator, and I can't wait to see what you will create with it.
Thank you.

<h3>Who is Merk &amp; what is this?</h3>
<p>I am! My name is Merk and I am an artist and storyteller from middle of nowhere Canada. I've been making comics independently for upwards of a decade now with 2  self published books under my belt: ""Victor's Legacy"" (written by Matthew Jowett &amp; Andrew Sookram) and ""Nowadays"" (written by Kurt Martell). Now I'm ready to do a book completely by me and ""Season of the Dead Hours"" is it.  A 112 b/w graphic novel about banished sorcerers returning to this world, trying to gather power before they are ripped fro this world &amp; sent back into their magical limbo. We follow one sorcerer, Sitchenn, as he enlists the help of a young, Irish boy named Fionn. Fionn's eyes are opened to a magic long obscured from mortal eyes. He encounters creatures hidden right before him as they make their way to one final battle with Sitchenn's foes the Janus Magus.  But not all is what it seems in the world of magic.</p>
<p>This campaign, with your help, will make the printing of this book possible, something I can't do on my own. I am not a publishing house. I am not flush with cash (I'm an artist, remember? It's a good day if i can buy a sandwich).  This whole endeavor.... is just me. I am doing EVERYTHING involved in this book from the story conception to art to this campaign to advertising to bagging up &amp; shipping you all the awesome perks involved to your door!  You have a chance to be a part of that.  90% of the work on the book is done, so now it's just that final stretch and you could have a book in your hands.... or on your table.... or by the toilet? Wherever you want to put it is cool by me.  No judgement. Or hey! A Christmas gift? There is a special Xmas deal... read on!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Break it down.</h3>
<p>Ok. The goal is $8500. That will print 2000 books &amp; cover the perks that I'm offering which will include tshirt printing, poster printing, stickers, teleportation, and whatever else my brain will come up with to make this an awesome offer for you. This is very clear and simple. ALL the funds raised go towards that. I don't make money from this part. This covers me making the book, getting it professionally printed. I've worked with these printers before and they do beautiful work!</p>
<p>Ok. Now, the STUFF YOU GET! Depending on what level you contribute at, you get lots of great stuff. You can get things from: <strong>RANDOM THINGS</strong> find lying around my house (seriously, I am tons of things in my house &amp; will put random things in. Might be a paperclip. Could be a comic trade. Might be original art. Or maybe a signed photo from a complete stranger), a personalized, <strong>SIGNED COPY OF THE BOOK</strong>, a thank you/name drop in the book (if you contribute at any level, you get a name drop in the book &amp; a big smoochy book thank you!),  <strong>MERK DESIGNED SEASON SHIRTS</strong> (designs to be revealed!), <strong>PERSONALIZED SKETCHES</strong> (you pick, I draw), I make YOU into a sorcerer/sorceress in a <strong>LIMITED EDITION POSTER PRINT</strong> (only those who contribute at that level get 'magiced' and I turn you into some sort of wielder of ancient power, with whatever input you want to give me for your look), have an <strong>AD IN THE BOOK</strong> (Do you have a business or are you an artist who wants to have your ad in the book? I travel all over North America going to conventions and so could your ad, not to mention through my website and other contributors to the campaign. HEY FELLOW COMIC ARTISTS, here's your audience. Target them.), and since I do my art 'traditionally', not digitally, there are gorgeous, <strong>ORIGINAL INKED PAGES</strong> up for grabs (those puppies will be very limited). And who knows what else I will toss into the campaign as we go along. Think about it. You go to a bookstore to buy a book. Here, you are preordering that book, dealing DIRECTLY with the creator, and getting a bunch of fantastic extra stuff along with it!!  And then there's the <strong>XMAS DEAL</strong>! This book will NOT be printed before Christmas, BUT if you are purchasing it as a gift for someone for Christmas, then I will send you a Christmas Card stating that you are a &amp;^%$ing amazing friend/family member and have ordered this book &amp; perks for them and will receive it post haste!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>I've done this before.</h3>
<p>So I've contributed to other campaigns before.... and waited... and waited... and waited, only to have something arrive out of the blue years later or sometimes never to receive anything at all.</p>
<p>That will not happen.</p>
<p>I hate when that happens so I make sure that I never do that to others. And I've done campaigns before. Kurt &amp; I did our 'Nowadays'  graphic novel (look it up here on the ol' indiegogo) and got it printed &amp; out to everyone within the stated timeline of a couple months from campaign completion. This book is almost completed. I don't do these fundraising campaigns until I am almost done the book. You're not paying me to work on the book. You're paying for the book. It's penciled. It's 95% inked and words are being put into their word bubble mouths &amp; things getting set for the printer. It is tentatively scheduled to hit the printer in February so it will be in everyone's beautiful, little hands by April or May (depending on print/shipping times).  You will not be waiting around for me to finish things up. I've done the VAST majority already. All I need now is you.....</p>
<p>So that's it. That's the idea. I love to make art and tell stories. 20 years ago, I wouldn't have been able to do it this way (and maybe not at all), but this sort of thing now is AMAZING on BOTH sides of the fence, for creators and readers.  We get to connect. I get to share these things from my brain (and soul) without companies telling me what to create and what story to tell. YOU get to be a part of something that few people get to enjoy. Think about it. This isn't some international best seller that will be in every store. This is a small print run and you will have been a part of creating it. And your name will be in it!! This is a big thing for me. I've spent YEARS doing this book. And I want you to read it.</p>
<p>So contribute if you can. Share if you can't (or contribute AND share ... because Kenny Loggins wants you to). Sharetools, check 'em.  Join me on this wacky journey. Questions, drop me line.</p>

<h3>So Who Are You, Anyway?</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Kristin Tipping. I’m a queer comic artist living in Minneapolis. I’ve been published through Uncivilized Books and was a recipient of the 2019 Artist Initiative Grant. I make a lot of strangely endearing bittersweet work full of fluffy animals, queer feelings and existential dread. </p>
<p><font><span>Evil Witch Allie was inspired by a lot of the comics and shows I experienced growing up, like XXX Holic and Natsume Yuujinchou as well as my own experiences growing up queer in a small town. I enjoyed the blend of character drama, whimsy, and danger those stories provided, and I wanted to write a story about queer and marginalized characters that doesn’t define the characters by those aspects of themselves. </span></font></p>
<p>The comic started as my thesis project in art school and has since mutated into it’s own series. I’m posting the pages online as I finish them and collecting each story arc into a print volume as I complete it. The new volume will include all of the second story arc and an exclusive bonus comic at the end. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Budget and Timeline</h3>
<p>The goal for this campaign is $1600. All money raised will go towards printing, IndieGoGo fees and shipping materials. </p>
<p>The good new timeline wise is that all 140 pages of Book Of Secrets are done! So you won’t have to worry about waiting around for me to finish the book. It’s already finished! </p>
<p>Right now I’m hesitantly planning to get all the rewards shipped out in July. However, given the times we live in I can’t promise there won’t be shipping delays. I'll keep you updated on any timeline changes as they arise.</p>

<h3>Featuring A god-like anti-hero, a psychotic sister bent on domination and a marauding Zombie Werewolf! </h3>
</center>
<p>Hello, my name is Rob Sacchetto and I’ve been an illustrator and freelance artist for over 25 years. You might know me from <a href=""http://www.zombieportraits.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">www.ZombiePortraits.com</a>, a project that allows me to create original zombie-themed artwork on a daily basis. Or maybe you’ve seen one of my many zombie related artwork appearances in <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2198774/Theyre-dead-good-The-Queen-Marilyn-Monroe-Will-Smith-Sean-Connery-youve-seen-before.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">magazines</a>, <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/20/zombie-portraits-by-rob-s_n_1810978.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">newspapers</a>, <a href=""http://laughingsquid.com/custom-zombie-portraits-by-zombie-artist-rob-sacchetto/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blogs</a> and television? That exposure has allowed me to do something I love for a living and for that I am <strong>very</strong> grateful.</p>
<p><strong><em>But, before and throughout all my zombie adventures, I’ve always been a comic book nerd.</em></strong></p>
<p>A million years ago I sold my first comic book collection to buy my first car. Since that regrettable day, I’ve been slowly reclaiming that collection. But I've also grown more and more obsessed with my own comic book project. </p>
<p>Over 15 years ago I conceived the idea that would eventually become Cape Fear. What was initially intended as a comic book mini-series has grown into a complete 150 page graphic novel. It is a project that is on the cusp of completion. I just need a little extra support before I can unleash my creation upon the world.</p>
<p>Specifically, I want <em>your</em> support. I’ve opted to enter into the crowd-sourcing route because I want to directly engage the people who will read Cape Fear. I want you to feel like part of the process, to share in its success and I want to be able to offer you great perks and rewards in addition to what I think is a dynamite graphic novel.</p>

<p>Cape FearCape Fear is unlike anything you’ve ever read. It will definitely appeal to fans of horror and, although the characters display heroic qualities, Cape Fear is anything but a superhero comic.</p>
<p>After a quarter century of avid reading, I feel I am finally telling the kind of story that has all the elements I’ve always enjoyed. Beyond my fondness for monsters, sexy chicks and aliens, (which have all incorporated into Cape Fear), I have penned a tale which is both multi-layered, and complex – without being convoluted.</p>

<p>Recently, Fear has found himself needed on earth much too often.</p>
<p>Without giving too much away, Fear embodies a host whose personal life becomes affected by his curse. Fear’s sister Nyxia returns from hundreds of years of exile scheming to usurp Fear and a Zombie Werewolf tears through the pages of the book.</p>

<p>Actually, what I need is your support! The Cape Fear graphic novel is almost complete. It was created without outside funding or grants.

THE STORY

Cape FearCape Fear is unlike anything you’ve ever read. It will definitely appeal to fans of horror and, although the characters display heroic qualities, Cape Fear is anything but a superhero comic.
After a quarter century of avid reading, I feel I am finally telling the kind of story that has all the elements I’ve always enjoyed. Beyond my fondness for monsters, sexy chicks and aliens, (which have all incorporated into Cape Fear), I have penned a tale which is both multi-layered, and complex – without being convoluted.

Cape Fear stars Fear itself, manifested as a physical ‘godlike’ creature. Fear’s physical presence on earth is necessary only in extreme circumstances. Instances in which there is such a profound imbalance in power that it threatens the continued existence of mankind.
Recently, Fear has found himself needed on earth much too often.

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>We are Ann ""Chezhnian"" Kennedy and Eren Fitzgerald, the creator/writer and co-writer/artist of an epic fantasy webcomic, Tamuran.  Through this campaign we hope to raise funds to help us get book 1 of our comic - the first seven chapters - into print.  </p>
<p><img alt=""The main cast of Tamuran"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.tamurancomic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/580pxtamuranbanner.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What is Tamuran?</h3>
<p>Tamuran is the story of a kingdom besieged by the forces of an ancient enemy and betrayed from within. It follows the journey of four unlikely individuals whose lives get tangled up in this plot, and who, despite their differences, shortcomings, and secrets, may be the kingdom's only hope for survival. On the way they must deal with friends, enemies, family, monsters, dragons, shapeshifters, necromancers, nature spirits.. and their own inner demons.  <br/><br/> The story of Tamuran started out as a chat-based roleplay set in a world Chezhnian had been developing for many years, as a fun way for some old friends to keep in touch.  In the four years since we started writing, it has developed and grown beyond that - into an epic story spanning multiple plot threads and many, many characters.</p>
<p>Since January 2010 we have been publishing Tamuran online as a webcomic, updating with a new page ever Tuesday and Friday.  So far we've posted nearly 8 chapters - roughly 250 pages. You can read the comic at  <a href=""http://tamurancomic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tamurancomic.com</a>. </p>
<p>(Please note that Tamuran is recommended for teenaged readers and up, as it contains some coarse language and violence.)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What are we doing here?</h3>
<p>It has long been our dream to see Tamuan printed, and with your help on this campaign we've got the chance to make that happen.</p>
<p>The books we're planning to print will be 6x9"" perfect-bound paperbacks with around 240 pages.  They'll contain the prologue through Chapter 7 of the comic, fixed up and retouched, plus some fun extras like a map of Tamuran, extra bonus artwork, character profiles, and ""directors' commentary"" notes. We would like to have the books printed and ready to debut at Ohayocon in January.</p>
<p>We are hoping to raise at least $2500 though this campaign to help with the costs of getting these books printed and shipped, registering ISBN numbers, and shipping and materials to get the books to you. If we raise more than our goal, we'll increase the number of books in our print run. If we should VASTLY surpass our goal, any money we raise beyond what we need for printing, shipping, taxes and fees, and rewards for our contributors, we will put toward the costs of things like maintaining our website and creating more comic pages, helping us to make convention appearances to get our books out there and meet more of our readers, and printing Book 2 once chapters 8 through 12 are completed.</p>
<h3>What's in it for you?</h3>

</div></div>","Hello!
We are Ann ""Chezhnian"" Kennedy and Eren Fitzgerald, the creator/writer and co-writer/artist of an epic fantasy webcomic, Tamuran.  Through this campaign we hope to raise funds to help us get book 1 of our comic - the first seven chapters - into print.  



What is Tamuran?
Tamuran is the story of a kingdom besieged by the forces of an ancient enemy and betrayed from within. It follows the journey of four unlikely individuals whose lives get tangled up in this plot, and who, despite their differences, shortcomings, and secrets, may be the kingdom's only hope for survival. On the way they must deal with friends, enemies, family, monsters, dragons, shapeshifters, necromancers, nature spirits.. and their own inner demons.   The story of Tamuran started out as a chat-based roleplay set in a world Chezhnian had been developing for many years, as a fun way for some old friends to keep in touch.  In the four years since we started writing, it has developed and grown beyond that - into an epic story spanning multiple plot threads and many, many characters.
Since January 2010 we have been publishing Tamuran online as a webcomic, updating with a new page ever Tuesday and Friday.  So far we've posted nearly 8 chapters - roughly 250 pages. You can read the comic at  tamurancomic.com. 
(Please note that Tamuran is recommended for teenaged readers and up, as it contains some coarse language and violence.)


What are we doing here?
It has long been our dream to see Tamuan printed, and with your help on this campaign we've got the chance to make that happen.
The books we're planning to print will be 6x9"" perfect-bound paperbacks with around 240 pages.  They'll contain the prologue through Chapter 7 of the comic, fixed up and retouched, plus some fun extras like a map of Tamuran, extra bonus artwork, character profiles, and ""directors' commentary"" notes. We would like to have the books printed and ready to debut at Ohayocon in January.
We are hoping to raise at least $2500 though this campaign to help with the costs of getting these books printed and shipped, registering ISBN numbers, and shipping and materials to get the books to you. If we raise more than our goal, we'll increase the number of books in our print run. If we should VASTLY surpass our goal, any money we raise beyond what we need for printing, shipping, taxes and fees, and rewards for our contributors, we will put toward the costs of things like maintaining our website and creating more comic pages, helping us to make convention appearances to get our books out there and meet more of our readers, and printing Book 2 once chapters 8 through 12 are completed.
What's in it for you?
Please check out our list of pledge levels and rewards & goodies along the sidebar.  ALL contributions are appreciated, and all contributors will receive access to behind-the-scenes updates and sneak peeks into the development of the books and extras, as well as a thank-you shoutout on Twitter and Facebook.  International contributors, please remember to add $10 to your pledge to help cover shipping costs.

<h2><strong>So...you're doing a book? What's it about?<br/></strong></h2>
</div>
<div>My name's Anne and I'm an artist based in Western MA. I started an autobio comic in 1995 called <em>booty</em> to document my day-to-day life after finishing college, going to work in the woods for a little while, and then on to graduate school.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The twist in the story, because there's always a twist in the story, is that I did all of these things before I turned 21. I dropped out of high school in 1991 to start at a tiny college in the woods in Great Barrington called Simon's Rock College of Bard, where for the first time in my life someone told me I was smart, where I met people who were like me, where I learned and fell in love and finally saw possibility in my life.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You might or might not know that school for other reasons. The next year, in December of 1992, a classmate of mine bought an AK-47, got bullets in the mail, and shot his way through the snowy campus. He murdered two people, injured more, and changed the arc of my life.<br/><p><em>What You Don't Get</em> is my first long-form comic work and it's a vastly different project for me for a few reasons. It's a project I've planned to undertake for a number of years, but the timing wasn't right, or the story wasn't done, or I just wasn't ready to write it.</p>
<p>I'm ready now.</p>
<h3>What's with the title?</h3>
<p>There's a long tradition of professional mourners. In Ireland, they were women called ""keeners"" who were paid to mourn over a body. One story involves a priest and a particularly loud keening woman who made her living by mourning the dead.</p>
<p>At one point in the story, the priest turns to her and says, unkindly, ""You'd cry over a dead dog if they paid you enough.""</p>
<p>""There's no need to be so bitter, Father,"" she apparently fired back. ""What you don't get from the living you get from the dead.""</p>
<p>And that's something I think about a great deal: what do I get from my dead? How are they present in my living? <em>What You Don't Get </em>is basically about both of those questions. In the months after the shootings I became a relentless journaller, writing everything down instead of speaking to other people. Reading back though those journals, it's like someone else wrote them. In the years since, I've written comics about those same questions -- not only on anniversaries or birthdays, or some other day that always felt too bittersweet-- but every time there was some new terrifying news report about some other mass shooting somewhere, more murders in schools. This project is a way to tie these disconnected experiences together as part of a longer, larger story about life and grief and losing people you love, but also about living and surviving and what those things mean.</p>
<h2>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>Otherwise known as the money stuff...</p>
<p>After research and discussion with many other artists, I decided to publish with Lulu.com because of their flexible publication options. My goal is to do a signed and numbered first printing of between 150 and 200 books, to have stock to bring to various shows and distribution networks and also to get the books to my backers. Each book will likely cost about $6 to produce -- about $900 to about $1200 depending on final page counts (between 100 and 128 digest-size pages is my projection) and total final copies.</p>
<p>$400 of this campaign will cover the cost of the lengthy and tedious process of converting the 100+ drawn pages into a digital format. In the interest of finishing in a timely fashion, I'm getting some help from a fellow artist on this one, because I just don't have enough technical know-how yet and I want to support another working artist while I learn.</p>
<p>The last $400 of this proposal covers the assorted shipping costs of getting books to me and then getting the books to you (postage will cost about $3 per copy in the US) and various other expenses (mailers, promotional material, sample copies, fundraising fees, etc.) associated with printing a long form book and crowdsourcing the funding.</p>
<p>Perks!</p>
<p>Everyone loves perks. I wanted to do a combination of cool things and essential things. A hand made card isn't essential, but it's important -- and even though this project is going to be hard and heartbreaking and difficult, it's exciting to be able to actually be in a place where I can do it and I want to celebrate that -- so the perks are both practical and quirky.</p>
<p>What if...</p>
<p>I want to finish this book no matter what happens with the fundraising. So even if I don't hit my minimum needed, which is probably about $700, there will still be something in your mailbox. I want to use this opportunity as a way to force me to finish this project and quit stalling; that accountability is a major part of why I chose the flexible funding option rather than the fixed all-or-nothing funding option.</p>
<p>The Impact</p>
<p>This project is something I intend to complete within the next 45 days, which is also the duration of my fundraising campaign. As part of one of the perks, I'm completing a panel-a-day minicomic basically about the experience of getting the project going. <em>What You Don't Get</em> is also going to be my full-time project for the next 45 days and my intent is to come out of the end of that 45 days with a finished book, no matter what happens with the funding.</p>
<p>But I'd be really, really excited if it got fully funded. I have some ideas where money raised beyond what I need might go (most specifically a Best of Booty book collection), but we can talk about those things when we get there.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Well, we're there!</p>
In the works is a best of booty collection. Booty's my autobio comic that I've been writing since 1995; I did one collection covering issues 10 through 17 some time ago, but I've been looking to get something more recent together (and if I sell through those last 18 pre-order copies, it's gonna happen for sure).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm working up some cool odds &amp; ends, including some small things to add into everyone's perks. Once the final copy is done, I'm going to scan through and pick out some images to put on 1-inch pins and little vinyl stickers -- fun perks for everyone!</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't donate, you can still help. Sharing the link among your social networks to get the word out is incredibly helpful. Reading this far is helpful too; it's a new experience for me to talk this openly not just about my work but also about my past and my process. I'll update this site with sketches and news as the project moves forward so you can stay in touch and watch how it goes.</p>
<p>thanks, folks.</p>

<h2><strong>Who Is This Don Rosa Guy And What Are His “Classics”?</strong></h2>
<p>You might know Don Rosa for his Eisner Award winning work on Uncle $crooge and Donald Duck comics, but even before he started working with those world famous characters, he was a well-known comic book artist. His creator-owned strip series, “The Pertwillaby Papers,” started in the newspaper of his college, and was later continued in a fanzine. A second series with the main character Lance Pertwillaby, now transformed into the superhero parody “Captain Kentucky,” followed in a local newspaper later on. For more images of both characters, see our “Updates” and “Gallery” tabs.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><img alt=""Don in his 'Comic Vault.'"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://imageshack.us/a/img690/3219/donzo.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Don in his 'Comic Vault.'""/></div>
<h2><strong>What Are the Strips About?<br/></strong></h2>
<p>In case you've never read them, here's a quick synopsis: <em>The Pertwillaby Papers</em> are about the adventures of Lancelot “Lance” Pertwillaby and his friends and colleagues around the world. The adventures start with the political satire of Lance's admittance into college and his life there, and a treasure hunt to the Andes in search of the Inca temple of Manco Cápac. Afterwards, Lance, together with his friends and enemies, is searching for the sizeable art collection hidden in the North Pole by the Nazis, and in another story they find and capture a black hole, and travel to the centre of the Earth. Finally, there's a story in which Lance is sent to King Arthur's time. As for <em>Captain Kentucky</em>, it's a sequel of sorts to the <em>Pertwillaby Papers</em>, featuring Lance becoming the superhero parody Captain Kentucky. Lance has taken up job as a newspaper journalist in Louisville, Kentucky, and due to toxic waste being dumped into a sewer where he was happening to be writing a story, he discovers that by drinking the toxic waste, he is temporarily given super-powers. He salvages a large barrel and keeps a small vial of it on his person, in case of an emergency. The strip often features real events and local celebrities from Louisville and Kentucky as backdrops, or, occasionally, as supporting characters in storylines.</p>
<h2><strong>What's With These New Books?</strong></h2>
<p>While there have been a few reprint editions of those two classic Rosa series, the only book set that featured the complete run of them in English was a hardcover version published in Norway in 2001. This old edition has been out of print for quite some time now, and to celebrate Don's return to Germany this fall (he'll be doing a signing tour sometime around September/October), a new deluxe edition, consisting of two hardback volumes, is in the works to be sold before and during his signings. However, as the printer has to be paid before the books go out to the readers, this campaign was started to secure the production. The project is being organized by Jano Rohleder, a longtime friend of Don Rosa's, who is also the German editor/translator of his Duck work. Therefore, it's a given that the books will aim at the highest possible quality standard.</p>

Who Is This Don Rosa Guy And What Are His “Classics”?
You might know Don Rosa for his Eisner Award winning work on Uncle $crooge and Donald Duck comics, but even before he started working with those world famous characters, he was a well-known comic book artist. His creator-owned strip series, “The Pertwillaby Papers,” started in the newspaper of his college, and was later continued in a fanzine. A second series with the main character Lance Pertwillaby, now transformed into the superhero parody “Captain Kentucky,” followed in a local newspaper later on. For more images of both characters, see our “Updates” and “Gallery” tabs.

What Are the Strips About?
In case you've never read them, here's a quick synopsis: The Pertwillaby Papers are about the adventures of Lancelot “Lance” Pertwillaby and his friends and colleagues around the world. The adventures start with the political satire of Lance's admittance into college and his life there, and a treasure hunt to the Andes in search of the Inca temple of Manco Cápac. Afterwards, Lance, together with his friends and enemies, is searching for the sizeable art collection hidden in the North Pole by the Nazis, and in another story they find and capture a black hole, and travel to the centre of the Earth. Finally, there's a story in which Lance is sent to King Arthur's time.

We would love to keep on creating great stuff for you but we need your support to be able to do so. Financial support (e.g buying a copy of the book for yourself) is not the only way of support, sharing our content is also invaluable for our growth.Thank you for being here and we hope you will enjoy the Fallen Ones dark fantasy comic book! Be safe, for there are numerous horrors lurking in the shadows between the pages ;) 
Magyar kampány leírás / Hungarian description FONTOS: A könyvben 18+ korhatáros tartalom is előfordulVér / Erőszak / Meztelenség / Szexuális magatartás / KáromkodásMost, hogy a kampány sikeresen lezárult, minden stretch goal-t elértünk még a kampány alatt és a nyomtatott, 150 oldalas képregények eljutottak a támogatóinkhoz, szeretnénk még többet adni nektek!Szeretnénk folytatni a Bukottak történetét, ezért elhatároztuk, hogy megnyitunk 5 újabb, kampány utáni stretch goal-t. Minden egyes cél, amit elérünk, egy teljes, 30 oldalas résszel bővíti a sorozatot. Kész vagy rá, hogy a következő szintre emeld ezt a történetet?Akkor vásárold meg a Digitális Képregény perket, legyen tiéd a 150 oldalas képregény és egy szuper háttérkép, és végül, derítsd ki, hogy mi következik a vég után… Azzal, hogy megvásárolod ezt a perket, megkapsz majd minden Kampány Utáni Stretch Goal tartalmat is, ahogy azok elérhetővé válnak, miközben ezzel lehetőséget adsz nekünk arra, hogy folytathassuk a Bukottak történetét. Köszönjük!A megosztás egyet jelent azzal, hogy több értéket kapsz a pénzedértSzeretnéd már olvasni a folytatást és megkapni a digitális könyvet ingyen? Akkor oszd meg ezt a kampányt a barátaiddal, akiket érdekelnek a képregények! Minél többen veszik meg az első részt digitálisan, te annál több Bukottak 2 tartalmat kapsz majd meg, ahogy egyre több kampány utáni célt teljesítünk. Hajrá! Segíts te is abban, hogy ennek a kampánynak a híre minél több emberhez eljusson, elvégre ezzel mindenki egyértelműen nyer. Minden egyes megosztással közelebb kerülsz ahhoz, hogy ugyanannyi pénzért több értéket kapj.Megosztom FacebookonEgy kitaszított farkasember, egy magányos feltaláló, és egy gyönyörű orgyilkosnő. Látszólag semmi közös nincs bennük, a véletlen mégis szövetségbe kovácsolja őket, hogy útját állják egy démoni szekta hatalomra kerülésének. Vajon felemelkedhetnek még a bukottak, vagy az örök kárhozat vár rájuk?Bromm likantróp, azaz vérfarkas, származási helye és eredeti neve ismeretlen. Egy Germánia környéki erdőben portyázó kisebb klán tagja volt, míg kitaszítottá nem vált. Miközben reményvesztve menekül, egy rendkívül különös hang csalogatja őt egy ködös kisváros falai elé.Clémence-t gyerekkora óta kitűnő prostituáltnak és még kitűnőbb orgyilkosnak képezték ki. A szüleit még kislánykorában lemészárolták, ő pedig emberkereskedők markába került. Épp mikor eldöntötte, hogy új életet kezd, utolsó orgyilkos küldetésén útja egy olyan városba viszi, ami a szeme láttára tűnik elő a semmiből.Tobias van Gerwen kantoni kémmester és feltaláló. Életét a vérkristályok kutatásának és soha nem látott mértékben kifinomult gépek kifejlesztésének szentelte. Nem sokkal később azonban ezzel kivívta a konkurens tudóscéhek rosszallását, majd családjával együtt el kellett menekülnie. Felesége a hosszú út során meghalt, most pedig Tobias a fiával együtt egy különös városba tartanak, abban a reményben, hogy ott majd békére lelnek.A Bukottak képregénysorozat az Unseen Domains sötét fantasy univerzumában játszódik.„A régi világ elpusztult, s romjain döghadak lejtettek haláltáncot”A 17. század közepén járunk. A megébredt mágia és hatásai, a tomboló élőhalott-járványok letarolták Európát, majd végletesen átalakították az egész világot is. Államok tűntek el, népek szóródtak szét, kulturális zárványok formájában maradt csak meg valami a régi hagyományokból.Aki túl akart élni, annak alkalmazkodnia kellett a boszorkánypestis korához. Az új idők szavára új hősök születtek. Rég elfeledettnek hitt teremtmények bújtak elő valahonnan, ahol eddig rejteztek. Mítosznak, babonaságnak hitt dolgokról derült ki, hogy mindig is léteztek, csak az értő, mágikus látása hiányzott hozzá a legtöbbeknek, hogy észre is vegyék őket.Ha akadtak volna az új időknek kartográfusai, egészen különleges térképeket rajzolhattak volna. Olyan földabroszokat, amelyen már nem szerepeltek országhatárok, legfeljebb többé-kevésbé kiterjedt zónák a nagyobb Menedékek körül. Elzárt völgyek, melyek még alkalmasak voltak az életre, és vidékek, amiket ritkábban jártak az élőholtak. Minden más csak pusztaság és letarolt földek - a holtak birodalmai.Ha esetleg nem sikerült meggyőznünk a fentiekkel, kérjük hagyd, hogy most a munkánk beszéljen helyettünk. Az Bukottak képregénysorozat 5 része, amely ebben a könyvben nyomatatott formában is benne lesz, elérhető webes képregény formában, online is a honlapunkon keresztül: kattints ide és olvasd el őket.Ha a munkánk elnyerte a tetszésed és te is szeretnéd kézbe venni a nyomtatott könyv változatot, akkor nincs is más dolgod, mint választani egy olyan csomagot az alábbiak közül, melyben már szerepel a könyv is. Ígérjük nem fogod megbánni :)Egy kis magyar csapat vagyunk, mi állunk az Unseen Domains sötét fantasy univerzum kulisszái mögött. Tavaly eredetileg még azért álltunk össze, hogy egy videojátékot készítsünk, de annyira beszippantott minket ez az univerzum, hogy elhatároztuk, tovább bővítjük más műfajokban is. Aztán már azon kaptuk magunkat, hogy egy képregénysorozaton dolgozunk gőzerővel, melynek a Bukottak nevet adtuk. Most pedig úgy gondoljuk, hogy elérkezett az idő arra is, hogy ezt az 5 részes sorozatot egy kötetbe foglaljuk össze, hogy mindenki kedvére forgathassa.Ezek vagyunk mi, a Bukottak képregénysorozat mögött álló csapat:Végül pedig, ha tetszik ez a kezdeményezés és a tartalmat is érdekesnek találjátok, segítsetek nekünk egy megosztással abban, hogy ennek a képregénynek a híre minél több emberhez eljuthasson. Nagyon szeretnénk továbbra is hasonló ötletekkel előrukkolni, de ehhez szükségünk van a támogatásotokra. És itt nem feltétlenül anyagi támogatásról beszélünk (amikor is kiválasztasz innen egy csomagot), azzal is rengeteget segítesz abban, hogy fejlődni tudjunk, ha megosztod a munkánkat másokkal is a környezetedben.Nagyon köszönjük, hogy itt vagy, és reméljük, hogy a Bukottak képregény kötet elnyeri majd a tetszésed! Végül pedig légy résen, hisz sötétség és rettegés leselkedik rád eme lapok közül :)""Kerüljön el messzi a Pestis!""",42.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h3><strong>WHAT’S THIS ALL ABOUT?</strong></h3>
<p><br/>The trio of Flame Girl, Magno, and Atoman find themselves in the middle of a forest. Each one was taken away at a crucial moment leaving loved ones behind in mortal danger. They do not know why they are there, what the Dark Tunnel is or even if they’ll get home in this action packed 30 page story.<br/>The 10 page backup story follows Scarlett Dalton, a young puritan woman from 1692. She was betrayed by her fiancé and burned as a witch. But her spirit was bound to a statue and she roams the multiverse via the Dark Tunnel helping those whom are ensnared by the supernatural. In this story she stumbles across a lost child who is captured by a soul eater as Dr. Haunt watches and does nothing!<br/>This book is 40 pages of content and will remind you why you fell in love with comics in the first place.</p>
<h3>
<br/><strong>ARE YOU A FAN OF GOLDEN AGE SUPERHEROES?</strong>
</h3>
<p><br/>Do you love comic books and/or comics from the 1970’s &amp; 80’s, golden age superheroes, fantastic stories, bizarre cosmic gods,  great characters and that sense of wonder and awe... this is the book for you!</p>
<h3>
<br/><strong>WHAT’S THE DARK TUNNEL?</strong>
</h3>
<p><br/>The Dark Tunnel is what ties my comic book universe together (or the Dark Tunnel Universe- DTU).  It brings our characters (some from different public domain publishers) together.  Below is the Dark Tunnel's explanation within the comics universe.</p>

<h3> <br/><strong>WHO MADE THIS?</strong>
</h3>
<p><br/>Hi, I’m Chris Dreier. I started my comic book career as an inker back in 1994. I’ve worked for Antarctic Press, Chaos! Comics, Dark Horse, IDW and Joe Books just to name a few,<br/>I create, write, ink and color my ongoing series called Freaks &amp; Gods which is published by 215Ink. From the very beginning I knew I was creating a very unique universe, something I wanted to expand on since the first issue of Freaks &amp; Gods was finished. So here comes Tales of the Dark Tunnel #1.</p>
<p><br/>The main story Disc World of the Great Filter is penciled by Giuseppe D’Elia. He is the Freaks &amp; Gods series penciler. You can contact Giuseppe via email giuseppe.delia@alice.it  if you’re interested in his work.</p>
<p><br/>The backup story A Terrifying Visitor is pencils by Shawn Van Briesen. Shawn has worked on The Creeps magazine. You can contact Shawn via his website (<a href=""http://www.shawnvanbriesen.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.shawnvanbriesen.com</a>) if you’re interested in his work.</p>
<p><br/>It’s important to know that you do NOT need to read Freaks &amp; Gods to follow this book. It takes place in the same universe (the Dark Tunnel Universe) but with different heroes. It’s like this—say it’s 1982 and you go into a comic shop and think the X-men look interesting. You would not need to read Avengers to follow along.</p>
<p><br/>This book is completely finished! All we need is your support to bring it to life! </p>

<p><em>A widowed woman unable to carry on and who only lives in the odd chapters.</em><br/><em> A fundamentally optimistic man who lives in the even chapters and is about to find out a shocking truth about his own identity.</em></p>
<p>These are the premises of Magpies, graphic novel about loss, love and the quest for the real self<span>.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p>Magpies is a labor of love – it’s a very special project and it's ready to be printed!</p>
<p>If you’d like to know more about it and preview the whole thing you can go <a href=""http://www.magpiestale.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HERE</a>. </p>
<p>The digital edition of Magpies <a href=""http://www.magpiestale.com/buy-magpies/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">is already available</a> (and you get to set the price for that) but even if digital is supercool, I think nothing beats the feeling of flipping from one page to the next under a blanket.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Book Specs</strong></h2>
<p><span><img alt=""magpies mockup"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.magpiestale.com/mockup.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""magpies""/>The perfect bound book will be 160 pages, will measure 8x10 inches and will be printed on high quality paper. </span><span> </span>Every page will be printed in full-color and will be awesome.</p>
<p>I decided to print in Italy rather than abroad in China like many larger companies do, to have full control over the printing process.</p>
<p>The plan is to send Magpies to the printer in January, after the Christmas madness. The printing process will take about 2 months for the proofs, printing and shipping to happen. This means I'll probably be getting the books around March or maybe April if something goes wrong (and let's assume it will: hope for the best and prepare for the worst).</p>
<p>But I'm hoping I'll be able to get my copies sooner than that, so that I'll be able to start shipping right away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>How does this work?</strong></h2>
<p>If you're not familiar with IndieGogo or crowdfunding in general, here's a brief overview. </p>
<p>For the next 30 days, you'll be able to make pledges to help support this project, ranging from $5 to whatever you can afford without going broke or having to divorce. You can select one of the perks on the right, corresponding to the amount you wish to donate. This means you're not only being awesome: you are also receiveing stuff as proof of that! </p>
<p>Your credit card or paypal account will not actually be charged at the time you make your pledge.</p>
<p>If the final deadline comes and we've reached our goal, then everyone gets charged the amount they pledged at the same time, and after Indiegogo and paypal get their share, I start printing and mailing books and t-shirts and whatnot. But if for some reason we don't meet our goal, the whole thing is called off. No one gets charged, no fees are applied, everyone just keeps their money. </p>
<p>Of course, if we fail to meet the goal, then no one gets any rewards, and this is pretty sad.</p>

<p>Shipping costs are already built into the rewards and I'll be paying most of it: retail price will be 30$ plus shipping, which will be 13 dollars for Italy and 25 for International shipping. So you might want to get your copy now and save some money!</p>

Il Pacchetto Gruppo Supporto Fotografi Pigri che trovate in fondo a destra e' un laboratorio online di fotografia lungo un anno: ogni mese riceverete lezioni, contenuti  e materiali didattici e ci sara' un forum ad accesso privato che permettera' di condividere foto ed esperienze. 
Se avete dubbi o domande, andate qui http://www.saralando.com/blog/?p=1994
**********************************
 
 
 
A widowed woman unable to carry on and who only lives in the odd chapters. A fundamentally optimistic man who lives in the even chapters and is about to find out a shocking truth about his own identity.
These are the premises of Magpies, graphic novel about loss, love and the quest for the real self.
 
Magpies is a labor of love – it’s a very special project and it's ready to be printed!
If you’d like to know more about it and preview the whole thing you can go HERE. 
The digital edition of Magpies is already available (and you get to set the price for that) but even if digital is supercool, I think nothing beats the feeling of flipping from one page to the next under a blanket.
 
 
Book Specs
The perfect bound book will be 160 pages, will measure 8x10 inches and will be printed on high quality paper.  Every page will be printed in full-color and will be awesome.
I decided to print in Italy rather than abroad in China like many larger companies do, to have full control over the printing process.
The plan is to send Magpies to the printer in January, after the Christmas madness. The printing process will take about 2 months for the proofs, printing and shipping to happen. This means I'll probably be getting the books around March or maybe April if something goes wrong (and let's assume it will: hope for the best and prepare for the worst).
But I'm hoping I'll be able to get my copies sooner than that, so that I'll be able to start shipping right away.
 
 
How does this work?
If you're not familiar with IndieGogo or crowdfunding in general, here's a brief overview. 
For the next 30 days, you'll be able to make pledges to help support this project, ranging from $5 to whatever you can afford without going broke or having to divorce. You can select one of the perks on the right, corresponding to the amount you wish to donate. This means you're not only being awesome: you are also receiveing stuff as proof of that! 
Your credit card or paypal account will not actually be charged at the time you make your pledge.
If the final deadline comes and we've reached our goal, then everyone gets charged the amount they pledged at the same time, and after Indiegogo and paypal get their share, I start printing and mailing books and t-shirts and whatnot. But if for some reason we don't meet our goal, the whole thing is called off. No one gets charged, no fees are applied, everyone just keeps their money. 
Of course, if we fail to meet the goal, then no one gets any rewards, and this is pretty sad.
 
 
 
What We Need & What You Get
We're hoping to raise $20,000 to pay for the cost of printing ($12.000) and producing perks ($6500), and cover the Indiegogo fee (that will take 4%), the PayPal fee (that will take 3,5% of what's left) /bank fees.
What's left is going to help cover part of the shipping costs, which are insane.
The money won't cover any my costs for making Magpies: I have already happily paid for that out of my own pockets. And I'm not trying to make a profit either: that will come later, when I'll be selling the copies that I'll have left.
In exchange for your support, you'll be able to choose between some basic rewards and some really amazing packages: they're all listed on the right, so pick your favorite! 
If this campaign goes over its funding goal, I already have lots of ideas for additional rewards: more pages, cooler additional rewards for those who already backed, special limited editions, original artworks, a juggling monkey… maybe not the monkey.
If the goal is not reached before the end of the 30 days, though, then you will not be charged anything. You only pay if the project reaches its goal before the deadline!
Shipping costs are already built into the rewards and I'll be paying most of it: retail price will be 30$ plus shipping, which will be 13 dollars for Italy and 25 for International shipping. So you might want to get your copy now and save some money!

<h3>Due West: A Travel Memoir</h3>
<p>Hello! I’m Alix West, a writer and illustrator. Currently, I am working on <i>Due West,</i> a serialized graphic memoir about traveling with my dead grandmother.</p>
<p>About five years ago, I discovered that my parents had been casually hoarding a box of my grandmother's travel journals since she died in 1999. Being twelve at the time of her death, I have only vague but rosy memories of Gramma. Seeing her writing as an opportunity to know more about the woman I'd idolized in my youth, I started sifting through them. </p>
<p>Her journals span from 1978 to 1996. The earliest recounts a tour of Greece and the Soviet Union. Recently widowed, Gramma decided she would try solo travel and discovered that she loved it. Over the next twenty years, she would add a few more entries to her list of travels.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480644086/dl4qosxc3wie1caen0bm.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Next Spring, I plan to follow in her footsteps. Using her journals, I will travel to places she visited before me and create a serialized graphic memoir contrasting my experiences today against hers in decades past. I have funding to recreate her first trip in 1978, but in order to expand the project, I am also raising money here, on Indiegogo.</p>
<p>In writing this travel series, I want to not only examine my relationship with the women in my own family, but also to look at the broader ideas of maternal inheritance and reaction to change. The world is a vastly different place today than it was 38 years ago. In the context of ever-increasing globalization and seemingly exponential technological advances, I hope we don’t forget to consider what has been left to us, and what we leave behind in return. Building on my grandmother's legacy, this project will be part of my own.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>Budget &amp; Timeline</strong></h3>
<p>I will be traveling during the Spring of 2017. The comics won’t be finished for some months after I return, since it is rather difficult to travel with my drafting table, flatbed scanner, large notebooks, etc. However, backers will receive regular updates during my trip that will likely include limited artwork.<br/><br/>In addition to the money I raise from crowdfunding, I have already received partial funding for this project from Wellesley College’s Mary Elvira Stevens Traveling Fellowship. My budget projection is based on my fundraising goal of $5,000 in combination with my fellowship funding. Here’s a pie chart:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480629708/xqi5df6fbdcrbgbouajh.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>*This breakdown is ultimately pointless because it is highly unlikely that I will meet my exact campaign goal, no more, no less. Certain costs are fixed vs. variable, and that’s how economies of scale work. But I am led to believe that people like charts in this section, so...</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>Here are some backer perks! They are available in various combinations, but I thought you might like some better descriptions than what’s over in the right sidebar there.</p>
<p><strong>Postcard</strong></p>
<p>I will send you a postcard from my trip! You can express a preference from where you would like to receive such a missive, I guess, but I reserve the right to ignore your wishes.</p>

<p>Exactly what it says on the box.</p>

<p><strong>Comics</strong></p>
<p>For every country I visit, you’ll receive a digital comic. I cannot, at this time, predict how many issues that will be, because that is entirely dependent on the amount of money I raise. However, thanks to that sweet fellowship money I got from Wellesley, you’ll be receiving a minimum of three (3) issues. Even if I don’t meet my goal! Of course, if you want more comics than that, you’ll have to give me all your money and convince all your friends to give me their money, too.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480643209/ynj1kpiqxa4ksioqsj26.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Additionally, you’ll receive a digital prologue comic before I embark, because I already wrote it. It features my baby niece throwing things around in the background of several panels, because she is a confident lady who knows what she is about.</p>
<p><strong>Souvenir</strong></p>
<p>I will send you a small trinket or such from travels. Who knows what it will be! One time, I came very close to buying a Venetian glass combination bottle-opener/toenail clipper for my brother-in-law, and <i>then I didn’t, because I am a complete and utter dunce.</i> It is truly one of my life’s greatest regrets. I shan’t be making that mistake again.</p>
<p>Whatever your treasure may be, it will most likely contain some marginal utility. Despite my artist sensibilities, I am a Spartan at heart.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Cartoon Portrait</strong></p>
<p>Do you want a cute cartoon portrait of yourself? I’ll draw one for you. Here's Cartoon Me quoting Oscar Wilde:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480649832/pccwrhgal1xsyatz5gfe.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Portrait of Your Grandma</strong></p>
<p>I will create a portrait of your grandmother/other maternal figure, provided you send me a picture first. (I’m not a mindreader; I don’t know what your grandma looks like.)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480650267/vxxry863ntk2rrigjaw0.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>But Alix</i>, you say, <i>what about a portrait of my Grandpappy Ephraim? I liked him much better than my shrill harpy of a Grandmother Josephine, who only ever gave me self-help books for Christmas, even when I was a toddler. </i>I am very sorry to hear about Grandmother Josephine. She sounds… well-meaning, if nonetheless terrible. Unfortunately, the entire point of this project is grandmothers and maternal inheritance. Maybe you have a Great-Aunt Suzy you always liked? If no, please come back in a few years when I decide to write something about my dad’s side of the family.</p>
<p>Medium negotiable. I specialize in watercolor, line art, screenprinting, and pasta art.</p>
<p><strong>Original Artwork</strong></p>
<p>I will create some custom artwork from my travels for you to suit your personal interests, both in terms of medium and content.</p>
<h3>Risks</h3>
<p>My risks are normal travel risks. Getting sick, having my stuff stolen, dying in a fiery plane crash. Basically, things that could happen any time, independently of this project. I’ll have insurance.</p>

For every country I visit, you’ll receive a digital comic. I cannot, at this time, predict how many issues that will be, because that is entirely dependent on the amount of money I raise. However, thanks to that sweet fellowship money I got from Wellesley, you’ll be receiving a minimum of three (3) issues. Even if I don’t meet my goal! Of course, if you want more comics than that, you’ll have to give me all your money and convince all your friends to give me their money, too.

Additionally, you’ll receive a digital prologue comic before I embark, because I already wrote it. It features my baby niece throwing things around in the background of several panels, because she is a confident lady who knows what she is about.
Souvenir
I will send you a small trinket or such from travels. Who knows what it will be! One time, I came very close to buying a Venetian glass combination bottle-opener/toenail clipper for my brother-in-law, and then I didn’t, because I am a complete and utter dunce. It is truly one of my life’s greatest regrets. I shan’t be making that mistake again.
Whatever your treasure may be, it will most likely contain some marginal utility. Despite my artist sensibilities, I am a Spartan at heart.
Digital Cartoon Portrait
Do you want a cute cartoon portrait of yourself? I’ll draw one for you. Here's Cartoon Me quoting Oscar Wilde:

Portrait of Your Grandma
I will create a portrait of your grandmother/other maternal figure, provided you send me a picture first. (I’m not a mindreader; I don’t know what your grandma looks like.)

But Alix, you say, what about a portrait of my Grandpappy Ephraim? I liked him much better than my shrill harpy of a Grandmother Josephine, who only ever gave me self-help books for Christmas, even when I was a toddler. I am very sorry to hear about Grandmother Josephine. She sounds… well-meaning, if nonetheless terrible. Unfortunately, the entire point of this project is grandmothers and maternal inheritance. Maybe you have a Great-Aunt Suzy you always liked? If no, please come back in a few years when I decide to write something about my dad’s side of the family.
Medium negotiable. I specialize in watercolor, line art, screenprinting, and pasta art.
Original Artwork
I will create some custom artwork from my travels for you to suit your personal interests, both in terms of medium and content.
Risks
My risks are normal travel risks. Getting sick, having my stuff stolen, dying in a fiery plane crash. Basically, things that could happen any time, independently of this project. I’ll have insurance.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

The Land of Frida Explained

Frida is the land that the descendants from Viking voyages migrated too. As big as a continent, Frida is a self sustaining land with more than enough resources for its people. It is split into 4  ""Factions"".  With their own twist of Viking culture and traditions.

Faction 1: North African
Faction 2: Norway, Denmark, Sweden
Faction 3: Mediterranean
Faction 4: Greenland and Iceland

 
The people of Frida live in harmony, but it wasn't so simple when the land was first discovered. Vikings did what they knew best, fighting, raiding and trading. It wasn't until the chieftains came up with a notion to live in harmony by appointing a leader of, Frida. The only way one becomes King or Queen is through a bloodshed tournament they call... RAGNARÖK!  
Ragnarök
Ragnarök (named after destruction of the cosmos) is the ONLY time the land of Frida allows for unpunished bloodshed. Each faction must put up their greatest warriors, in a fight to the death tournament. There can only be ONE survivor! The warrior who wins the tournament grants his/her faction to choose its King or Queen to rule over, Frida.

I've been writing comics for about 2 years and I've managed to self publish 2 books on my own. Our Project The Cursed and The Damned is a story I have been wanting to tell for some time. I took 2 characters and put them against each other. Werewolves vs Zombies. I've been a fan of horror since I was about 10 years old and grew up with George Romero's zombies and loved all the Howling movies. Taking these 2 great ICONS and putting them in a story together meant reliving a part of my childhood and telling a story that would satisfy any horror and comic fan at the same time. Not only are Contributors helping finish this project but at the same time giving it life. I've personally funded the other 2 books published through N.A.S Studios but with The Cursed and The Damned I need help funding it. I went all out and now need your help in making it happen. Funding this project helps pay everyone working on the project (all Artist), designers, printing and distribution.    </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Synopsis - <i>The Cursed and The Damned is a story about Werewolves taking on the horrific result of playing God. As the Werewolves come together they bring about a war where no Zombie or Human is Safe.

After determining how big we wanted to go with the project we decided to budget and try Indiegogo to get everyone paid for there hard work and added our printing and distribution cost as well. To break it down a bit more here is a list of everything needing to get taken care of. </span></p><p>- Pencils, Inks, Flats, Colors, Lettering, Writing, Printing and Distribution <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">   </span></p><p>NOW !!! for a little on our rewards.

I've been writing comics for about 2 years and I've managed to self publish 2 books on my own. Our Project The Cursed and The Damned is a story I have been wanting to tell for some time. I took 2 characters and put them against each other. Werewolves vs Zombies. I've been a fan of horror since I was about 10 years old and grew up with George Romero's zombies and loved all the Howling movies. Taking these 2 great ICONS and putting them in a story together meant reliving a part of my childhood and telling a story that would satisfy any horror and comic fan at the same time. Not only are Contributors helping finish this project but at the same time giving it life. I've personally funded the other 2 books published through N.A.S Studios but with The Cursed and The Damned I need help funding it. I went all out and now need your help in making it happen. Funding this project helps pay everyone working on the project (all Artist), designers, printing and distribution.    Synopsis - The Cursed and The Damned is a story about Werewolves taking on the horrific result of playing God. As the Werewolves come together they bring about a war where no Zombie or Human is Safe. Can they fix what they started or watch as humans become prey and the real enemy watches from the shadows?What We Need & What You GetTo finish The Cursed and the Damned and get it into your hands we need your help. Financing the product and getting everyone paid for there hard work is a main priority for us, we all believe in this project and decided to start production with out any budget. After determining how big we wanted to go with the project we decided to budget and try Indiegogo to get everyone paid for there hard work and added our printing and distribution cost as well. To break it down a bit more here is a list of everything needing to get taken care of. - Pencils, Inks, Flats, Colors, Lettering, Writing, Printing and Distribution    NOW !!! for a little on our rewards. We have a few one of a kind covers that will only be available on here. The Cursed and The Damned #1 will have an exclusive cover which will only be available as a reward here on Indiegogo.

<p><span>Are you some kind of leprechaun who lives in a tiny house and needs something to hang on your wall? Then you’re in luck! For five U.S. gold, you can receive this POSTER FOR LEPRECHAUNS. Rendered in beautiful pixel art and mailed without an envelope (so as many people as possible can see it), this work of art features a small yellow cat, a dramatic sunset, and a signed “thank you"" message on the back. What a deal!</span></p>

<h3>Tier 2: Tapestry Pack</h3>

<p></p>
<div>
<span>“But I’m not a leprechaun, I’m a human!”, you cry out! “What will *I* hang on my normal, human-sized walls?”</span><p></p>
<p>Well, human, you are in luck! For a mere 25 U.S. gold, you can receive a FINE TAPESTRY. Printed with bold colors on ye olde polyester knit, these tapestries are essentially posters that don’t fold or tear, are machine washable, and can be crumped up and sent in a regular envelope rather than an expensive poster tube. Choose between two designs: the 18”x28” <a href=""http://www.prequeladventure.com/this/PosterScale.png"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Scale”</a> by Kazerad (with coloring help from Ben Hale), featuring Yellow Cat Thing in a large, detailed environment, or the 28”x14” <a href=""http://www.prequeladventure.com/this/PosterUnity.png"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Unity”</a> by Cheryl Kerr, reminding you that all fantasy races can get along if they really try, and are naked.</p>
<p>And if THAT weren’t enough, the tapestry pack also includes TWO unsigned postcards (so you can send them to your leprechaun friends!) and a sheet of <a href=""http://www.prequeladventure.com/this/KatiaStickers.png"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">KATIA STICKERS</a>. Featuring six tiny pictures of Yellow Cat Thing giving weird looks in varying direction, these stickers are perfect for introducing a bit of judgmental staring to your other wall decorations.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>And, if even THAT wasn’t enough, this and all larger packages also come with an exclusive signed RECEIPT MINICOMIC! Ordinary receipts are stupid and boring and probably invented by elves, so this receipt is a little illustrated story that changes based on the items you purchase, starring the comic’s second-best human character, Asotil.</p>
<p></p>
<div>(Also, by popular request, you can now choose to switch the stickers out for the sew-on patch listed further below. Within a few days of purchase, you should receive an email where you can specify which tapestry you want and whether you'd like stickers or a patch.)</div>

<p>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-weight: normal; background-color: initial;"">Well, as any adventurer will explain before selling you a bunch of vases and wordlessly going to sleep on your couch, the most important thing an adventurer can have is a sturdy bag with which to carry all your questionably-obtained vases. </span><span style=""font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">And if you want such a thing, you're in luck! For 25 U.S. gold can receive two postcards, a receipt minicomic, and your very own WITCHHHUNTER TOTE BAG. </span>
</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Printed with swirly magic nonsense on both sides, this polyester tote has extra little pockets inside and an extra side pocket on the outside so you can pretend you’re organized as you completely ignore them and throw everything in the main pouch. Use the tote bag to carry your clothes, or to carry your groceries, or to run away with your enemies’ groceries! The possibilities are endless. </span></p>
<p>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">And want even more adventurer-worthy gear? Well, in this pack and every one after it, every 50 cents you pay over the listed price will net you a random FOUR-LEAF CLOVER PIN. Get enough to cover your entire body, making you so lucky you will become LITERALLY INVINCIBLE*.</span><br/>

<p>Posters and totes not your thing? Well, with winter rapidly approaching, your frail, human body needs insulation! One excellent way to achieve this is with a KATIA TORSO COZY, available for the fair price of 35 U.S. Gold.</p>
<p>Screen-printed with breathable, waterbase ink on Port&amp;Co tees, these cotton shirts are available in two designs: a <a href=""http://www.prequeladventure.com/this/ShirtCosplay.png"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">STEALTHY COSPLAY</a> based off Yellow Cat Thing’s armor, or a piece of <a href=""http://www.prequeladventure.com/this/ShirtSamba.png"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SWANKY, SILHOUETTED CHARACTER ART</a> drawn by notably-awesome artist <a href=""http://sambaneko.deviantart.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SambaNeko</a>. </p>
<p>But wait! In addition to that, two postcards, and a signed minicomic, you will also receive a <a href=""http://www.prequeladventure.com/this/KatiaPatch.png"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SEW-ON KATIA PATCH</a>. Beautifully embroidered and measuring just shy of 4 inches in height, the glossy, pineapple-shaped patch is the perfect thing to make your leather biker jacket look 100% less intimidating. That way, your enemies will underestimate you!</p>
<p>(Also, by popular request, you can now choose to switch the sew-on patch out for the stickers listed up above. Within a few days of purchase, you should receive an email where you can specify which shirt you want, as well as your size and whether you'd like stickers or a patch.)</p>

<p>Have you ever looked at a bunch of irregularly-shaped items and said ""wow, it would sure be difficult to find a box or envelope the appropriate shape to affordably send those""? Chances are you haven't, because buyers don't think about that sort of thing! This is probably why so many of you requested the playing cards from the higher-tier packs be available on their own.</p>
<p>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Fortunately, your consumer desires have been answered! </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">For 35 U.S. gold, you will receive a </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">deck of AMPHIBIOUS LIZARDPERSON PLAYING CARDS. Based off the deck of cards that appeared early in PREQUEL, this 52-card, poker-sized deck comes with a plastic box for storage and, like its in-comic doppleganger, is completely waterproof. It is the perfect table decoration to let all your visitors know you’re the type of weirdo who always chooses the reptilian race in games, even though you’ve never, ever won a game of Wesnoth as Drakes, or had a decent Slithzerikai character in Avernum. You’ll claim it’s just because you like their stats, but everyone will know the truth.</span>
</p>
<p>Still not sold? Well, this pack also <span style=""background-color: initial;"">comes with a bag of KATIA CANDIES.  Will hard candies survive being sent in bundle of tape and paper or however we decide to mail this?  </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Will the postal system pulverize them into a fine, sugary dust?

<p>Is your human mind wrought with indecision over whether to get a t-shirt or tapestry? Solve this problem by getting both! For the mere price of 60 U.S. gold, you can receive the DOUBLE PACK.</p>
<p>“But 60 U.S. gold is just as much as ordering a tee and tapestry separate!” your feeble human mind cries out. Well, hold onto your socks, because this is called the “double pack” for a reason. In addition to your choice of one tee and one tapestry, the double pack comes with TWO patches, TWO sticker sheets, and four blank postcards! That’s twice as much stuff as you’d get otherwise, perfect for when you fuck up sewing on a patch, applying a sticker, or addressing a postcard.</p>
<p>Plus, like the Candy Lizard pack, you'll get a bag of KATIA CANDIES! Will being sent in an envelope make them any more likely to survive the trip? We just don't know.</p>

<p>Well crack out your fucking coinpurses, humans, because this is where we get into the cool stuff. For 100 U.S. gold, you will receive the TREASURE CHEST, featuring your choice of any two shirts or tapestries, plus two patches, two sticker sheets, two bags of candy, the receipt comic, the playing cards, the tote bag, a stack of eight postcards, and six random clover pins.

<p>What’s <i>that</i>, human? You’re COMPLETELY AWESOME and have ENTIRELY TOO MUCH MONEY? Well, celebrate your extravagance with a nine-foot wide rendition of Cheryl Kerr’s “Unity” mural. Easily capable of covering an entire wall, this near-life-size duplicate of the mural from the comic is the perfect decoration for a formal dining room. Your guests will show their appreciation with sparse, awkward side-glances to the mural, trying not to talk about it lest they spend inordinate amounts of time basking in its glory. “Wow,” they’ll say, “the man/woman/other who owns this house sure is a normal and functional human being”. </p>

<p><span>Estimates are hard, and last time PREQUEL’s author ran a crowdfunding campaign, it made over eight times as much money as expected! What happens if this campaign receives inordinate amounts of gold?</span></p>
<p>At <b>$50,000</b>, after accounting for production costs, shipping, et cetera, and assuming he can do a big run of new merch every year or two, PREQUEL’s author will no longer need a job. While this won’t necessarily lead to him making more comic updates (since that would constitute being paid to write fanfiction!) it will certainly remove the biggest hurdle to pursuing such hobbies full-time.</p>
<p>At <b>$100,000</b>, PREQUEL’s author will have an obscene amount of money! This is a person who cannot fathom a level of luxury that costs more than 30k a year, tops, and would have no idea what to do with anything beyond that.

<p></p>
<p><span><b>Q: I just paid for one of the tiers! How do I tell you which tapestry design I want, or what my shirt size is?</b></span></p>
<p><b>A</b>: Spectacular question, fictitious human! Within a day of paying, you should be emailed a link where you can specify the designs you want and the size needed for each (just in case your torso is different sizes depending what color shirt you wear!). If you do NOT receive a link, it’s time to get angry! Send a very angry email to a@foxmage.com demanding you get the link NOW.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>(NEW) Q: What shirt sizes are available?</b></p>
<p><b>A</b>: Everything from Women's Extra Small to Women's 4XL, Men's Small to Men's 4XL, and Tall Large to Tall 4XL (do tall people have genders? Nobody knows!). One of the advantages to paying for the shirts before they are ordered is that they can be printed on whatever size is needed.</p>
<p><b>Q: How long will production/shipping take after the campaign ends?</b></p>
<p><b>A</b>: Probably one to two human months. After all the minigames with prizes, PREQUEL’s author has gotten very good at packing and sending hundreds of packages. Most of the merchandise items take 1-3 weeks to produce, with T-shirts being the slowest.</p>
<p><b>Q: I am a penniless human who is not going to buy anything! Will I still be able to read the receipt minicomic?</b></p>
<p><b>A</b>: Fear not, innocent peasant! The comic will be uploaded to the ""Side Stories"" page later, given that it’ll find its way onto the internet regardless within minutes of the first package arriving someone’s house. But this is your one chance to get a SIGNED, PHYSICAL COPY of the comic! Surely, that is worth taking the cushion off your couch and searching for 100 quarters (they are there! Trust me!).</p>
<p><b>Q: I am a weird person who wants to give you money and receive nothing in return! Can I do that?</b></p>
<p><b>A</b>: Indiegogo will let you do that, but that’s weird! Buy a shirt instead. Or, get a postcard and enter your head-of-state’s address instead of your own. Presidents love webcomics!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>(NEW) Q: I want a very specific combination of things (e.g. two shirts)! Can I buy two tiers, or even two of the same tier?</b></p>
<p><b>A</b>: You most certainly can! In fact, this is an optimal choice for people who want two copies of the minicomic, so they can put one in front of each eye and read in 3D.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>(NEW) Q: I am a to-the-point person who only wants one particular item with no minicomic or extras! Will items be sold individually after the Indiegogo campaign is over?</b></p>
<p><b>A</b>: Some extras will be sold, but they'll be limited in supply - everything is going to be printed in one go. Getting them here will cost you less and also guarantee you don't miss out on the limited supply sold afterwards.</p>
<p><b>Q: Everyone should donate blood to the red cross! It is not ran by vampires.</b></p>
<p><b>A</b>: Wow! That is not a question, but I am glad you have taken the time to say this completely true statement that everyone should know. </p>

</div></div>","Tier 1: Postcard

 



Are you some kind of leprechaun who lives in a tiny house and needs something to hang on your wall? Then you’re in luck! For five U.S. gold, you can receive this POSTER FOR LEPRECHAUNS. Rendered in beautiful pixel art and mailed without an envelope (so as many people as possible can see it), this work of art features a small yellow cat, a dramatic sunset, and a signed “thank you"" message on the back. What a deal!




Tier 2: Tapestry Pack




“But I’m not a leprechaun, I’m a human!”, you cry out! “What will *I* hang on my normal, human-sized walls?”
Well, human, you are in luck! For a mere 25 U.S. gold, you can receive a FINE TAPESTRY. Printed with bold colors on ye olde polyester knit, these tapestries are essentially posters that don’t fold or tear, are machine washable, and can be crumped up and sent in a regular envelope rather than an expensive poster tube. Choose between two designs: the 18”x28” “Scale” by Kazerad (with coloring help from Ben Hale), featuring Yellow Cat Thing in a large, detailed environment, or the 28”x14” “Unity” by Cheryl Kerr, reminding you that all fantasy races can get along if they really try, and are naked.
And if THAT weren’t enough, the tapestry pack also includes TWO unsigned postcards (so you can send them to your leprechaun friends!) and a sheet of KATIA STICKERS. Featuring six tiny pictures of Yellow Cat Thing giving weird looks in varying direction, these stickers are perfect for introducing a bit of judgmental staring to your other wall decorations.

And, if even THAT wasn’t enough, this and all larger packages also come with an exclusive signed RECEIPT MINICOMIC! Ordinary receipts are stupid and boring and probably invented by elves, so this receipt is a little illustrated story that changes based on the items you purchase, starring the comic’s second-best human character, Asotil.

(Also, by popular request, you can now choose to switch the stickers out for the sew-on patch listed further below. Within a few days of purchase, you should receive an email where you can specify which tapestry you want and whether you'd like stickers or a patch.)












Tier 3: Tote Pack



($5-$10 shipping will be added outside the U.S.)

Now, you might be wondering: ""but what if I have no walls? What if I'm a wild and rugged adventurer with no home to call my own?"" 

Well, as any adventurer will explain before selling you a bunch of vases and wordlessly going to sleep on your couch, the most important thing an adventurer can have is a sturdy bag with which to carry all your questionably-obtained vases. And if you want such a thing, you're in luck! For 25 U.S. gold can receive two postcards, a receipt minicomic, and your very own WITCHHHUNTER TOTE BAG. 

Printed with swirly magic nonsense on both sides, this polyester tote has extra little pockets inside and an extra side pocket on the outside so you can pretend you’re organized as you completely ignore them and throw everything in the main pouch. Use the tote bag to carry your clothes, or to carry your groceries, or to run away with your enemies’ groceries! The possibilities are endless. 

And want even more adventurer-worthy gear? Well, in this pack and every one after it, every 50 cents you pay over the listed price will net you a random FOUR-LEAF CLOVER PIN. Get enough to cover your entire body, making you so lucky you will become LITERALLY INVINCIBLE*.

*disclaimer: This was a lie! You will not be invincible! You’ll just poke your shirt full of holes.





Tier 4: Apparel Pack




($5-$10 shipping will be added outside the U.S.)
Posters and totes not your thing? Well, with winter rapidly approaching, your frail, human body needs insulation! One excellent way to achieve this is with a KATIA TORSO COZY, available for the fair price of 35 U.S. Gold.
Screen-printed with breathable, waterbase ink on Port&Co tees, these cotton shirts are available in two designs: a STEALTHY COSPLAY based off Yellow Cat Thing’s armor, or a piece of SWANKY, SILHOUETTED CHARACTER ART drawn by notably-awesome artist SambaNeko. 
But wait! In addition to that, two postcards, and a signed minicomic, you will also receive a SEW-ON KATIA PATCH. Beautifully embroidered and measuring just shy of 4 inches in height, the glossy, pineapple-shaped patch is the perfect thing to make your leather biker jacket look 100% less intimidating. That way, your enemies will underestimate you!
(Also, by popular request, you can now choose to switch the sew-on patch out for the stickers listed up above. Within a few days of purchase, you should receive an email where you can specify which shirt you want, as well as your size and whether you'd like stickers or a patch.)







Tier 5: Candy Lizard Pack




($5-$10 shipping will be added outside the U.S.)
Have you ever looked at a bunch of irregularly-shaped items and said ""wow, it would sure be difficult to find a box or envelope the appropriate shape to affordably send those""? Chances are you haven't, because buyers don't think about that sort of thing! This is probably why so many of you requested the playing cards from the higher-tier packs be available on their own.

Fortunately, your consumer desires have been answered! For 35 U.S. gold, you will receive a deck of AMPHIBIOUS LIZARDPERSON PLAYING CARDS. Based off the deck of cards that appeared early in PREQUEL, this 52-card, poker-sized deck comes with a plastic box for storage and, like its in-comic doppleganger, is completely waterproof. It is the perfect table decoration to let all your visitors know you’re the type of weirdo who always chooses the reptilian race in games, even though you’ve never, ever won a game of Wesnoth as Drakes, or had a decent Slithzerikai character in Avernum. You’ll claim it’s just because you like their stats, but everyone will know the truth.

Still not sold? Well, this pack also comes with a bag of KATIA CANDIES.  Will hard candies survive being sent in bundle of tape and paper or however we decide to mail this?  Will the postal system pulverize them into a fine, sugary dust? Will a folded up copy of the minicomic be enough to protect them? I have absolutely no idea! Think of it as a mirror of Yellow Cat’s own journey.




Tier 6: Double Pack



($5-$10 shipping will be added outside the U.S.)
Is your human mind wrought with indecision over whether to get a t-shirt or tapestry? Solve this problem by getting both! For the mere price of 60 U.S. gold, you can receive the DOUBLE PACK.
“But 60 U.S. gold is just as much as ordering a tee and tapestry separate!” your feeble human mind cries out. Well, hold onto your socks, because this is called the “double pack” for a reason. In addition to your choice of one tee and one tapestry, the double pack comes with TWO patches, TWO sticker sheets, and four blank postcards! That’s twice as much stuff as you’d get otherwise, perfect for when you fuck up sewing on a patch, applying a sticker, or addressing a postcard.
Plus, like the Candy Lizard pack, you'll get a bag of KATIA CANDIES! Will being sent in an envelope make them any more likely to survive the trip? We just don't know.





Tier 7: Treasure Chest



($10-$25 shipping will be added outside the U.S.)

So let’s say you want to guarantee your hard candies get there in one piece. They’ll need to be sent in a box. And, if you’re gonna be getting an entire box, it makes sense to fill it with all sorts of other stuff that won’t fit in an envelope.
Well crack out your fucking coinpurses, humans, because this is where we get into the cool stuff. For 100 U.S. gold, you will receive the TREASURE CHEST, featuring your choice of any two shirts or tapestries, plus two patches, two sticker sheets, two bags of candy, the receipt comic, the playing cards, the tote bag, a stack of eight postcards, and six random clover pins. Wowie gee!


Tier 8: GIVE ME EVERYTHING


($10-$25 shipping will be added outside the U.S.)

Still can’t make up your mind on what to get? Circumvent this issue with the GIVE ME EVERYTHING pack.
For 140 U.S. gold, you will receive both tapestries, both tees, the tote, the cards, and the minicomic. Plus, you’ll get a stack of eight postcards, two bags of candy, two patches, three sticker sheets, and twelve random clover pins! You are now the ultimate PREQUEL reader and everyone will love you*.
*disclaimer: This is also a lie! Only some people will love you.


Tier 9: Give me everything… BUT the Unity tapestry


($10-$25 shipping will be added outside the U.S.)

What’s that, human? Rainbows make you cry? You’re afraid of joyful diversity staring at you every day?
Lucky for you, for a mere 145 U.S. Gold you will be sent everything except the Unity mural. Instead, you can just get an extra copy of a tee, the tote, the cards, two each of the patches/stickers, or the other tapestry. Or a bunch of clover pins.


Tier 10: GIVE ME EVERYTHING BUT MAKE THE UNITY TAPESTRY NINE FEET WIDE


($10-$25 shipping will be added outside the U.S.)

What’s that, human? You’re COMPLETELY AWESOME and have ENTIRELY TOO MUCH MONEY? Well, celebrate your extravagance with a nine-foot wide rendition of Cheryl Kerr’s “Unity” mural. Easily capable of covering an entire wall, this near-life-size duplicate of the mural from the comic is the perfect decoration for a formal dining room. Your guests will show their appreciation with sparse, awkward side-glances to the mural, trying not to talk about it lest they spend inordinate amounts of time basking in its glory. “Wow,” they’ll say, “the man/woman/other who owns this house sure is a normal and functional human being”. 



Estimates are hard, and last time PREQUEL’s author ran a crowdfunding campaign, it made over eight times as much money as expected! What happens if this campaign receives inordinate amounts of gold?
At $50,000, after accounting for production costs, shipping, et cetera, and assuming he can do a big run of new merch every year or two, PREQUEL’s author will no longer need a job. While this won’t necessarily lead to him making more comic updates (since that would constitute being paid to write fanfiction!) it will certainly remove the biggest hurdle to pursuing such hobbies full-time.
At $100,000, PREQUEL’s author will have an obscene amount of money! This is a person who cannot fathom a level of luxury that costs more than 30k a year, tops, and would have no idea what to do with anything beyond that. In celebration of money no longer mattering at all, he’ll draw a tiny Katia in a day-appropriate hat every single day. At $150,000, PREQUEL’s author will hold SADCATCON once per month. It won’t actually be a convention, it’ll just be him camping out at a mall all day and doing sketches for anyone who shows up and/or requests one over a stream.


Q: I just paid for one of the tiers! How do I tell you which tapestry design I want, or what my shirt size is?
A: Spectacular question, fictitious human! Within a day of paying, you should be emailed a link where you can specify the designs you want and the size needed for each (just in case your torso is different sizes depending what color shirt you wear!). If you do NOT receive a link, it’s time to get angry! Send a very angry email to a@foxmage.com demanding you get the link NOW.

<p><br/>(NOTE: International orders please include an extra $5 for shipping)</p>
<p>TARZAN STORY WRITTEN BY DENNIS P. EICHHORN<br/></p>
<p>Hi.  I'm Albert Frank Asker.  I am a comic book fan from from Boise, Idaho.  Recently, I have given presentations on the history of comic books in Idaho at the 2013 Library Comic Con and the THATCamp 2013: Forging Digital Frontiers conference at Boise State University.  I have also recently written an article for The Blue Review called, ""The Wild West of Sequential Art: A History of Comic Books in Idaho.""</p>
<p>In order to commemorate the second annual Library Comic Con, and to celebrate our Idaho sequential arts heritage, I am starting this campaign to launch ""Tarzan and the Comics of Idaho"" comic book anthology.  This anthology will showcase the comic book talent from right here in the Gem State.</p>
<p>This is an officially licensed Tarzan comic book from Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. in Tarzana, California.  After the comic book has been printed, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. will keep eight copies of our comic book on file in their archives.  You can see some of Scott Pentzer's wonderful art on the Tarzan story above.  We plan to continue the Tarzan story in next year's anthology.<br/></p>
<p>Edgar Rice Burroughs lived in Idaho on three separate occasions in his life and is a big part of our Idaho sequential arts heritage.  That is why we have decided to license his most famous character for our anthology. </p>
<p>Some of the writers and artists involved in our anthology include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Charles Soule* (Superman/Wonder Woman, Death of Wolverine)<br/>
</li>
<li>Dennis P. Eichhorn (Real Stuff, Real Good Stuff, Extra Good Stuff)<br/>
</li>
<li>Todd Clark (Lola)<br/>
</li>
<li>Steve Moore (In The Bleachers)</li>
<li>Allen Gladfelter (Disney/Pixar's CARS, Occupy Comics)<br/>
</li>
<li>Dame Darcy (Meatcake)<br/>
</li>
<li>Randall Kirby (BOP! Comics)<br/>
</li>
<li>Steve Willhite (FUBAR)<br/>
</li>
<li>Scott Pentzer (Rose &amp; Gunn, Sade, Rock 'n' Roll Comics)<br/>
</li>
<li>Jim Sumii (Tura and Eva)<br/>
</li>
<li>Julia Green (Mystic Pets)<br/>
</li>
<li>Jon Keithley (Shivertown)<br/>
</li>
<li>Shanae LaVelle (Shivertown)<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>* <i>An adopted son of Idaho for the purposes of our anthology</i><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>Here is why we need money.  We need:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>$250 for the Tarzan licensing fee</li>
<li>$500 for printing costs</li>
<li>$50 for shipping costs<br/>
</li>

(NOTE: International orders please include an extra $5 for shipping)
TARZAN STORY WRITTEN BY DENNIS P. EICHHORN
Hi.  I'm Albert Frank Asker.  I am a comic book fan from from Boise, Idaho.  Recently, I have given presentations on the history of comic books in Idaho at the 2013 Library Comic Con and the THATCamp 2013: Forging Digital Frontiers conference at Boise State University.  I have also recently written an article for The Blue Review called, ""The Wild West of Sequential Art: A History of Comic Books in Idaho.""
In order to commemorate the second annual Library Comic Con, and to celebrate our Idaho sequential arts heritage, I am starting this campaign to launch ""Tarzan and the Comics of Idaho"" comic book anthology.  This anthology will showcase the comic book talent from right here in the Gem State.
This is an officially licensed Tarzan comic book from Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. in Tarzana, California.  After the comic book has been printed, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. will keep eight copies of our comic book on file in their archives.  You can see some of Scott Pentzer's wonderful art on the Tarzan story above.  We plan to continue the Tarzan story in next year's anthology.
Edgar Rice Burroughs lived in Idaho on three separate occasions in his life and is a big part of our Idaho sequential arts heritage.  That is why we have decided to license his most famous character for our anthology. 
Some of the writers and artists involved in our anthology include:

Charles Soule* (Superman/Wonder Woman, Death of Wolverine)

Dennis P. Eichhorn (Real Stuff, Real Good Stuff, Extra Good Stuff)

Todd Clark (Lola)

Steve Moore (In The Bleachers)
Allen Gladfelter (Disney/Pixar's CARS, Occupy Comics)

Dame Darcy (Meatcake)

Randall Kirby (BOP! Comics)

Steve Willhite (FUBAR)

Scott Pentzer (Rose & Gunn, Sade, Rock 'n' Roll Comics)

Jim Sumii (Tura and Eva)

Julia Green (Mystic Pets)

Jon Keithley (Shivertown)

Shanae LaVelle (Shivertown)


* An adopted son of Idaho for the purposes of our anthology
  What We Need & What You GetHere is why we need money.  We need:
$250 for the Tarzan licensing fee
$500 for printing costs
$50 for shipping costs


The artists and writers donated all of the talent, time, energy, blood, sweat, and tears for the good of the Friends of the Boise Public Library.  We again thank them for their efforts.  I will donate the cost of shipping the incentives out if it is over $50. However, it is preferred that donors pick up the comic book in person at the 2014 Library Comic Con on Saturday August 30th where the anthology will make its debut.  If there is any extra money left over, that cash will go to the Friends of the Boise Public Library.
  The ImpactYou will be able to own a piece of Idaho sequential arts history and help out a great cause at the same time.
  Risks & ChallengesWe're waiting on a couple of creators pieces so making the deadline will be a little stressful for the editor (yours truly).  We have already obtained the Tarzan license so that won't be a problem.  Also, this is the first time that we have worked with this printer so hopefully they will be able to turn out a quality product for us.
  Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help: 
Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign. Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools! 
 That's about it.  Thanks in advance for your help.",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Comics From the Farthest Corner of the Earth<br/></span></h3>
<p>Every year, Cloudscape Comics releases a new graphic novel anthology built around a specific theme. This year, we are proud to present our seventh compilation: <strong>Waterlogged - Tales from the Seventh Sea.</strong></p>
<p>Prepare yourself for a gorgeous hardcover tome printed in blue &amp; black and featuring over 30 different artists from British Columbia!</p>
<p><em>Waterlogged</em> is overflowing with all sorts of nautical goodness: explorers, kraken, pirates, mermaids, naval officers, ghosts, and more can all be found between the pages. Living as we do on North America's rainy northwest coast, the sea is always on our artists' minds. Each story is one creator's unique response to our great blue neighbour.</p>
<h3>Cloudscape Comics</h3>
<p><span> The Cloudscape Comics Society is a nonprofit artists' group based in Vancouver, <span>dedicated to supporting indie comics creators of all sorts. We have weekly gatherings, run events for the public, host a studio space for our members, and of course create comics.</span> We have a lot of experience making good books but without a publisher to back us, we rely on eager readers like you to fund each print run. We need your help to make this project a reality.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Because this project is a bit more ambitious than most we've done, the print cost is a little higher. With printing and shipping costs, Cloudscape needs to raise at least $6500 to get this going. If we make more than that, then more books will be printed! We have some stretch goals in mind too.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>Waterlogged </strong>is going to be Cloudscape's best book yet! Filled with beautiful seafaring tales, the collection boasts works from such fantastic artists as <strong>Sam Logan </strong>(<em>Sam &amp; Fuzzy</em>), <strong>Angela Melick </strong>(<em>Wasted Talent</em>)<strong>, Nina Matsumoto </strong>(<em>Yokaiden</em>, Bongo Comics)<strong>, Colin Upton</strong> (<em>Postmodern Mini-Comics</em>),<strong> Gabriel Frizzera, Lucy Bellwood </strong>(<em>Baggywrinkles</em>),<strong> Jonathon Dalton </strong>(<em>A Mad Tea-Party</em>)<strong>, Laura Bifano, Jeff Ellis </strong>(<em>Teach English in Japan</em>) and many others. <br/><br/></p>
<p>The book will:</p>
<ul>
<li>be hardcover</li>
<li>have a limited palette of blue and black</li>
<li>be over 200 pages!</li>
<li>have more than 30 artists and writers' work inside</li>
</ul>
<p>We are selling a variety of our other creations as part of this fundraiser, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>many of our previous anthologies</li>
<li>members' personal graphic novels</li>
<li>ebooks</li>
<li>prints</li>

<h3>At $7500:</h3>
<p>- Two new ebooks will be added to the ""Barrel-Full of Ebooks"" at no extra charge. One will be <strong>Chop Suey</strong> by Jonathon Dalton, and the other will be a surprise (I'm still securing the rights to the book that I want to include). </p>
<p>- Every reward at $45 or more will get a sticker of our Cloudscape coat of arms from <strong>Giants of Main Street,</strong> and a sheet of six temporary tattoos based on the gorgeous tattoos some of our artists drew for the title pages in <strong>Waterlogged</strong>. </p>
<h3>At $8000:</h3>
<p>- Every reward that needs to be physically mailed to backers will include one temporary tattoo and one sticker. </p>
<p>- Every reward worth $45 or more will also include a minicomic version of <strong>This Is How F***ing Scary the Ocean Is</strong> by Colleen Webber, which was originally going to be a part of <strong>Waterlogged</strong>, but couldn't be included because of its unusual size. </p>

tornadoes in U.S. history. About 8,000 buildings were damaged or destroyed, or around 30% of the city. Thousands of
families lost their homes and are living in shelters. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana;""> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana;"">Relief agencies are taking care of immediate needs: food,
clothing, and housing. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana;""> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana;"">We decided to offer what we can: astronauts, an octopus
with glasses, and talking hot dogs.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana;""> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana;"">When we heard that kids in Joplin have been struggling to
cope with the disaster, we decided to create <span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"">Comics Express</span>, a 24-page, FREE
comic book just for them. It'll be packed with funny comics and stuff to do
from some of the most creative, original, and well-known cartoonists. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana;""> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"">The comic book will give young kids up to teens something more fun to think about than damaged neighborhoods and uprooted lives. The Joplin Public Library will coordinate with local groups to distribute the comic books to kids FREE in July. <br/></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><br/><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;""></span></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"">Please help us raise $6,000 to cover the costs of printing and shipping <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Comics Express</span> to Joplin.

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"">Contributors who give $20 will get a copy of this amazing, limited-edition comic book. And if you're a comics fan, you're going to want one! Some pretty impressive artists are involved (see below).<br/></span></p>
<h3></h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"">A copy of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Comics Express</span> is also a great gift for kids in your life. Each $20 copy of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Comics Express</span> you buy pays for 16 copies for kids in Joplin.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><br/><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;""></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"">If you can give more than $20, our famous cartoonists will share even cooler rewards with you: posters, comic book collections, graphic novels, t-shirts, and original art.<br/></span></p>
<h3></h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"">How Will the Money Be Used?</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"">The $6,000 will go only towards printing and shipping the comic book, and to send rewards to donors. <br/></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;""><br/></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"">We're
 already at work on <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Comics Express</span>, so if you donate and we don't reach our goal, you're still <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">guaranteed</span> to get as many copies as your reward level promises. </span></p>

We've reached our goal! Thank you, donors! Any money collected after today will go to the Joplin Public Schools' Adopt-a-Classroom Fund to replace classroom supplies.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Why Make Comics for Kids in Joplin?Last month, Joplin, Missouri, was hit by one of the deadliest
tornadoes in U.S. history. About 8,000 buildings were damaged or destroyed, or around 30% of the city. Thousands of
families lost their homes and are living in shelters. 
 
Relief agencies are taking care of immediate needs: food,
clothing, and housing. 
 
We decided to offer what we can: astronauts, an octopus
with glasses, and talking hot dogs.
 
When we heard that kids in Joplin have been struggling to
cope with the disaster, we decided to create Comics Express, a 24-page, FREE
comic book just for them. It'll be packed with funny comics and stuff to do
from some of the most creative, original, and well-known cartoonists. 
 
The comic book will give young kids up to teens something more fun to think about than damaged neighborhoods and uprooted lives. The Joplin Public Library will coordinate with local groups to distribute the comic books to kids FREE in July. 

All cartoonists, editors, and designers are donating their work. We need your help to pay for printing 5,000 copies and shipping them to the children of Joplin.

How Can You Help?
Please help us raise $6,000 to cover the costs of printing and shipping Comics Express to Joplin. Anything you donate will help us create something fun for kids there, many of whom lost everything.

Contributors who give $20 will get a copy of this amazing, limited-edition comic book. And if you're a comics fan, you're going to want one! Some pretty impressive artists are involved (see below).

A copy of Comics Express is also a great gift for kids in your life. Each $20 copy of Comics Express you buy pays for 16 copies for kids in Joplin.

If you can give more than $20, our famous cartoonists will share even cooler rewards with you: posters, comic book collections, graphic novels, t-shirts, and original art.

How Will the Money Be Used?
The $6,000 will go only towards printing and shipping the comic book, and to send rewards to donors. 

We're
 already at work on Comics Express, so if you donate and we don't reach our goal, you're still guaranteed to get as many copies as your reward level promises. 

Any money we receive over our goal will go to the Joplin Public Schools Adopt-a-Classroom fund.

Please join us in making this original collection of awesome comics to benefit the kids of Joplin!

Who Are We?
We're a group of cartoonists, editors, and designers who used to work at Nickelodeon Magazine. For 16 years, we kept millions of kids entertained on a monthly basis. 

The award-winning comic artists in Comics Express include:
Bill Alger - Nickelodeon Magazine, Cartoon Network Presents, Homeboy

<h3>So what is this comic about?<br/>
</h3>
<p>At the start of Under Fire, Pvt Jeremy ""Sparky"" Sfakanos doesn't come home, and Pvt Adrian Baker is coming home haunted.  What he thinks is going to fix him -- his small town, his family, his old life -- turns out to be no less fractured than he is.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>That seems like a strange thing to write a comic about.<br/>
</h3>
<p>It's a story that I don't think gets enough attention-- whether real or fictional.  Besides, Under Fire is about a lot of things.  It's about coming back from life-changing events.  It's about holding onto the people you love when circumstances push you apart.  It's about being brave.  It's about wounded warriors.  It's about mental health.  It's also about family, hindsight, discrimination, and the unexpected.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The comic itself includes historical notes -- in the process of piecing together this story I learn more than I ever thought I'd know about problems with humvees, the history of camouflage, and the way we treat our returning soldiers.  Some of this shows up in nearly unnoticeable ways, but other pieces are so important or interesting that they need to be highlighted in text.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Why a ""starter &amp; convention kit""?  <br/>
</h3>This is still a work in progress.  It's going to take a lot of time and work to finish, at which point I'd like to sell it as a perfect-bound graphic novel, all in one piece.  If all goes well (i.e., if I have an income), I'll even be able to put a large portion of the profits toward organizations dedicated to returning service members that serve their mental health needs as well as their physical ones.  But to get there, we need two things: materials, and support.  <br/><br/>Support comes in the form of exposure, which we'll be able to get by presenting a piece of Under Fire at ConBust, SPACE, and MoCCA this summer by way of a super kind friend -- Kristina Stipetic, creator of <a href=""http://14nights.kstipetic.com/index.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">14 Nights</a> (comic occasionally NSFW) -- offering to share table space.  So in order to get our materials ready for the con circuit much sooner than we'd ever expected, we need your help to fund the printing of a small preview of Under Fire with authors notes, plus some prints of comic-related artwork.<br/><br/>Under Fire is made with pencil, pen, and markers.  The tricky thing about traditional media is that it runs out.  Unfortunately the last set of markers purchased turned out to be counterfeit -- they've already started to dry up.  Some of your donations will be put toward purchasing a set of refillable Shin Han Touch Twin markers (much more affordable than other art markers) and the ink to refill them.<br/><br/>If both of these things can happen, it will put Under Fire on a surer track to being completed and shared with the world.</div><div><br/></div><div>
<h3>If this is just a preview, what are the long-term plans?<br/>
</h3>
<p>Eventually this will be released, at its completion, as a full one-shot graphic novel project.  I say graphic novel project, and not only graphic novel, because the story also includes some prose and nonfiction/educational/historical notes, so it's slightly ""mixed media.""</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>My dream is not to make any substantial profit from this project, but to use it to raise awareness about the issues it includes in the story and, if it does make money past breaking even, to put a significant portion of the proceeds towards organizations that help address those issues (especially those dedicated to assisting returning veterans with rebuilding their lives stateside, maintaining housing, and coping with compromised mental and physical health).</p>

<p>The purpose of this campaign is to raise enough money for a small print run of a hardcover book version of my webcomic ""A Redtail's Dream"". So if the goal is met this is basically a grand preorder event for the book, and as with other crowdfunding campaigns; if the goal isn't reached all the money will be automatically refunded to everyone. In that case ""A Redtail's Dream"" will simply stay in its purely digital format on the web and the universe moves on. But let's aim for a book! </p>
<strong><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/28297/files/20130822155802-image1.jpg?1377212282"" src="""" style=""""/></p></strong><p><strong>If you stumbled upon this campaign</strong> without knowing about the comic beforehand, you can already read it for free <a href=""http://www.minnasundberg.fi/comicindex.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">over here if you'd like to</a>.  I started drawing this comic in spring 2011 during my second year of university, and finished it at 550 pages just a few months ago. The final chapter is currently being published online at a pace of six pages per week so you can still hop on and experience the end together with all the other wonderful and kind readers! The story is about a young Finnish lad named Hannu Viitanen and his shapeshifting, talking dog Ville, who are on a journey to bring back the souls of their fellow villagers from the realm of dreams. Much of the story is inspired by Finnish mythology, and it is quite child friendly and lighthearted (apart from a couple of mythological monsters here and there). </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/27927/files/20130822114734-whatbook.jpg?1377197254"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I asked once what kind of book my dear readers would like the hypothetical aRTD book to be if there was one, <a href=""http://www.minnasundberg.fi/comic/page359.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">and the overwhelming majority </a>wished to see the whole story in one big tome rather than splitting it into two or more separate books. So that's the way it'll be, and here's my little mock-up of the planned book:</p>
<h3></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/44236/files/20130831023739-mockup.jpg?1377941859"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>The specs of the book:</strong> 608 pages - Full color - Hardcover - Sewn binding - Rounded spine - Matt coated interior pages - about 40 pages of bonus content in the back of the book - the book will be the English version of the comic. *Update* Because of reaching stretch goals the book will now also have printed endpapers and silver-colored foiling and embossing on the cover, and a red chapter band!<br/></p>
<p>Reaching the goal will cover the cost of a 500 book print run (the common minimum order for traditional, high quality offset printed books), freight costs to get the books to me, shipping the books and other goodies to you guys, and Indiegogo's cut of the raised funds. If we raise more than the goal I can make the print run bigger and the book even fancier. In a best case scenario I might even start making a profit and will be able to dedicate my time to making more comics for all of you.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/44235/files/20130831023504-image3.jpg?1377941704"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>
<p><strong>This will be the only print run</strong> I'm planning on of making of this comic, so the book will be pretty much a limited edition. I'll get enough books printed so that those of you who can't grab a copy during this campaign can snap one up later on, but they won't stay in abundance.    </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/52821/files/20130904121855-whatstretch.jpg?1378322335"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Since the initial goal has been met let's see if we can make this book even fancier by knocking down some stretch goals! *Update* Weeeeelll, all stretch goals are met! So much extra stuff, ahh!<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/95722/files/20130925130746-stretchgoals.jpg?1380139666"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>It's of course possible to just donate funds to the print drive, but I'm sure most of you are interested in the goodies that come with the different reward levels, and especially the book itself.  Here's a little visual chart of what each level will get you:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/46005/files/20130901074356-tiers2.jpg?1378046636"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>So what's up with that 75$ Northern Star level?</strong> <strong>How does it work?</strong> Well, it's basically the same as the 90$ level, except it has the lower shipping cost for people within the Nordic coutries. So if you're going to have your book<strong> shipped to Sweden, Finland, Norway, Denmark or Iceland</strong> and want to save on shipping, pick this one. But wait, it's <em>also</em> the tier international folks can pick if they already have chosen a level with the book + international shipping and want to <strong>add a book to the same package</strong>. You can add as many as you want to! </p>
<p>To upgrade the Northern Star Level to include things from levels above it, simply change the amount to the amount of the level you want minus 15$. So for example: if you're living in Finland and want the lower shipping option for the 150$ Bumbling Bear Level, pick the Northern Star Level but change the amount to 135$. Simple! But you can only do this up to the 170$ level, the ones above that contain original artwork that'll need extra protection during shipping, so if you'd like one of those please pick the ""real"" level for that.  </p>

<p>I've got quite a few questions about upgrading a level after picking one, so I made this little guide on how to both upgrade to a higher level and to add items to your package. If you're not using an Indiegogo account, make sure you enter the same name and email in your info, that way I'll be able to keep track on all the extra stuff for each individual package. After the campaign is over I'll check with everyone what upgrades and/or extra items the additional contributions re for. So writed down what you're adding if you're going for a lot of extra stuff and have a horrible memory!</p>
<p><strong>Upgrade to a higher level:</strong>  Click on ""contribute now"" to make a second contribution, choose ""no perk, I just want to contribute"" and enter the difference between your current level and the level you want in the dollar amount field. For example: you already have the 90$ Scornful Squirrel Level but would want the 125$ Mighty Moose Level instead. 125-90=35 so you simply make a second contribution of 35$. </p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>Adding postcard print packs:</strong> some of you wanted to have extra postcard packs so that you could actually send some to people and keep a pack for yourselves, and here's how you do it. Click on ""contribute now"", choose ""no perk, I just want to contribute"" and enter 20$ x (the number of packs you want) in the dollar amount field. So if you just want one more pack it's 20$, if you want three extra packs make it 60$. (It's the same for both Nordic and international folks.) </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/57469/files/20130906113725-add-ons-books.jpg?1378492645"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Adding more books:</strong> Once you already have a level that includes the full shipping cost for your area (either Nordic or international) you can add more books with reduced shipping to your package. Pick the Northern Star Level (that I brilliantly misspelled as Northern ""Start"") and change the dollar amount to correspond to the book you want as shown in the image above. You can add as many books you want! (<strong>Note:</strong> If you're a Nordic person and want to add a 65$ book use the same contribution method as for the postcard pack instead as Indiegogo naturally won't let you change the Northern Star level amount to below the default 75$) </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/81627/files/20130918074954-add-on-drawings.jpg?1379515794"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>
<p><strong>In-book drawing upgrades:</strong> I've had some requests for a smaller drawing option for those who can't quite get reach the Bear Level and an option for a two-character drawing, and now that is possible. If you have <b>a book that has the signed bookplate</b> you can include the simpler mini-drawing with an extra 15$. If you have <b>a book that includes the normal, default drawing</b> you can upgrade that to a two-character picture with an extra 20$. </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>If you want to add several things to your package you can also add them all in one big contribution rather than with separates ones for each item. For example: if you live outside the Nordic countries and want to add 2 postcard packs and 1 signed book to your package, you can simply make a new contribution of 130$ (20+20+90). And it won't really matter if you do it via a ""no perk"" contribution or the Northern Star Level, using the NS level just helps me keep some kind of track on the amount of books involved before the campaign ends.</p>

<p><strong>I can't contibute until a couple of weeks from now! Is there a risk that some of the levels might sell out?</strong> Nope, no risk, I haven't limited any of the levels so you can jump in at any time and get exactly the one you want.

<p><b>Can I change my address after making my contribution? I entered it wrong/might be moving soon</b>.Yes you can, but don't worry about that yet.

<p><strong>When will the book be ready?</strong> I'm aiming to have the whole thing cleaned up, proof-read and prepped for print by the end of the year, so it should be printed and ready to be shipped during springtime in 2014. I'll keep you guys updated on the progress along the road.</p>
<p><strong>How can a poor person with no money help out?</strong> By spreading the word! It doesn't even have to be about this campaign, just letting people know about the webcomic itself is greatly appreciated and any new readers will equal pure happiness! </p>
<p><strong>Who were you again?</strong> Oh, right: hi, I'm Minna Sundberg, a Finnish-Swedish lady currently living in Sweden. I'm 23 years old and I just got my bachelor's degree in graphic design from Aalto University in Finland. I wanted to make A Redtail's Dream as a practice in drawing and writing comics, and it grew way out of its planned proportions during these two years, both in regards to size and readership. I wasn't even planning on ever publishing it as a book, but my wonderful readers slowly coaxed me into it. Right now I'm working on my next comic titled ""Stand Still. Stay Silent"" which you will all get to start reading online for free right after the last pages of A Redtail's Dream are published. I think that would be...November? This year anyway. I'm hoping to one day be able to support myself with my comic work and therefore dedicate all my time to it, and perhaps this book will help me along that path.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3> ~</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>That's it! And do leave a comment if you have any questions or anything, I'll try to answer as best I can. Thanks everyone, and let's enjoy the last chapter of A Redtail's Dream while this campaign runs its course! Oh, and spread the word if you can, I will appreciate it greatly.</p>
</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","The purpose of this campaign is to raise enough money for a small print run of a hardcover book version of my webcomic ""A Redtail's Dream"". So if the goal is met this is basically a grand preorder event for the book, and as with other crowdfunding campaigns; if the goal isn't reached all the money will be automatically refunded to everyone. In that case ""A Redtail's Dream"" will simply stay in its purely digital format on the web and the universe moves on. But let's aim for a book! 
If you stumbled upon this campaign without knowing about the comic beforehand, you can already read it for free over here if you'd like to.  I started drawing this comic in spring 2011 during my second year of university, and finished it at 550 pages just a few months ago. The final chapter is currently being published online at a pace of six pages per week so you can still hop on and experience the end together with all the other wonderful and kind readers! The story is about a young Finnish lad named Hannu Viitanen and his shapeshifting, talking dog Ville, who are on a journey to bring back the souls of their fellow villagers from the realm of dreams. Much of the story is inspired by Finnish mythology, and it is quite child friendly and lighthearted (apart from a couple of mythological monsters here and there). 


I asked once what kind of book my dear readers would like the hypothetical aRTD book to be if there was one, and the overwhelming majority wished to see the whole story in one big tome rather than splitting it into two or more separate books. So that's the way it'll be, and here's my little mock-up of the planned book:


The specs of the book: 608 pages - Full color - Hardcover - Sewn binding - Rounded spine - Matt coated interior pages - about 40 pages of bonus content in the back of the book - the book will be the English version of the comic. *Update* Because of reaching stretch goals the book will now also have printed endpapers and silver-colored foiling and embossing on the cover, and a red chapter band!
Reaching the goal will cover the cost of a 500 book print run (the common minimum order for traditional, high quality offset printed books), freight costs to get the books to me, shipping the books and other goodies to you guys, and Indiegogo's cut of the raised funds. If we raise more than the goal I can make the print run bigger and the book even fancier. In a best case scenario I might even start making a profit and will be able to dedicate my time to making more comics for all of you.

This will be the only print run I'm planning on of making of this comic, so the book will be pretty much a limited edition. I'll get enough books printed so that those of you who can't grab a copy during this campaign can snap one up later on, but they won't stay in abundance.    
 
 

Since the initial goal has been met let's see if we can make this book even fancier by knocking down some stretch goals! *Update* Weeeeelll, all stretch goals are met! So much extra stuff, ahh!


 


It's of course possible to just donate funds to the print drive, but I'm sure most of you are interested in the goodies that come with the different reward levels, and especially the book itself.  Here's a little visual chart of what each level will get you:

So what's up with that 75$ Northern Star level? How does it work? Well, it's basically the same as the 90$ level, except it has the lower shipping cost for people within the Nordic coutries. So if you're going to have your book shipped to Sweden, Finland, Norway, Denmark or Iceland and want to save on shipping, pick this one. But wait, it's also the tier international folks can pick if they already have chosen a level with the book + international shipping and want to add a book to the same package. You can add as many as you want to! 
To upgrade the Northern Star Level to include things from levels above it, simply change the amount to the amount of the level you want minus 15$. So for example: if you're living in Finland and want the lower shipping option for the 150$ Bumbling Bear Level, pick the Northern Star Level but change the amount to 135$. Simple! But you can only do this up to the 170$ level, the ones above that contain original artwork that'll need extra protection during shipping, so if you'd like one of those please pick the ""real"" level for that.  

I've got quite a few questions about upgrading a level after picking one, so I made this little guide on how to both upgrade to a higher level and to add items to your package. If you're not using an Indiegogo account, make sure you enter the same name and email in your info, that way I'll be able to keep track on all the extra stuff for each individual package. After the campaign is over I'll check with everyone what upgrades and/or extra items the additional contributions re for. So writed down what you're adding if you're going for a lot of extra stuff and have a horrible memory!
Upgrade to a higher level:  Click on ""contribute now"" to make a second contribution, choose ""no perk, I just want to contribute"" and enter the difference between your current level and the level you want in the dollar amount field. For example: you already have the 90$ Scornful Squirrel Level but would want the 125$ Mighty Moose Level instead. 125-90=35 so you simply make a second contribution of 35$.

Stories have the power to make the weak strong, to help the disenfranchised find their voice, to turn ordinary people into extraordinary beings. With that a super hero needs to be heroic, that is why Graphation makes “Comics That Care.” For every dollar you spend on our comics, half goes to an associated charity. Getting funds to organizations and causes that dearly need it. Each comic book is carefully paired with a specific charity because there is nothing quite like a super hero team-up. Two exceptional entities coming together to tell great stories and do good. Comics That Care. Great Stories. Doing Good. I Comic. I Care. Do you?Our “Pillars Of Power” represent our stretch goals, starting at a basic launch of the bare minimum line of comics. However the more money we raise the more spectacular stories we can tell and the more wonderful organizations we can help! So please help us not only reach our first Pillar of Power, but exceed that Pillar and help us become a fully funded force of philanthropy and reach the moon! We here at Graphation have devoted our lives to creating a business that tells great stories while helping the world. Now we're ready to share what we've achieved and with the help of the Graphation community do more AMAZING things, but doing so can be expensive! Our artists are extremely talented and deserve to be paid fairly, not to mention the costs of design and web and tech costs. Please join us on this FANTASTIC voyage!Outsider Andrew McGregor is chosen to become Captain Africa, the long forgotten champion of the continent.

<h3><strong>The Story</strong></h3>
<p>Pavel has just arrived in London and tries to make a living as a rikshaw driver, earning the rent for his rather modest room in the suburbs.<br/>But soon he is being pulled into a series of unsettling events, when he notices some strange behaviour among the local pigeons.</p>
<p>At a tower block in his neighbourhood two colonies of street pigeons are engaged in a violent conflict.  Pavel starts out to investigate the affair. But it soon becomes evident that pigeon society is far beyond his understanding and all his efforts for brokering peace are seemingly doomed to fail.<br/><br/>Watching an unstoppable spiral of violence go down towards a looming catastrophy, he begins to ponder about the fabric of urban society and what is necessary to make peaceful coexistence possible in a global metropolis...</p>

<h3>About The Project</h3>
<ul>
<li>My name is <strong>maleek</strong> and I am a comic book artist and illustrator from Berlin. I regurlarly contribute to a variety of publications and sell my zines and prints at comic festivals. <strong>Shoot-Up-Hill </strong>is my first Graphic Novel.</li>
<li>I started writing <strong>Shoot-Up-Hill  </strong>about three years ago, while working on other projects. Finally, in late 2017, I had the script ready and started production. By summer 2018 I had finished the artwork on the first volume (""Nesting""). My goal is to get it into print by November 2018 and you can help me with the production cost by pre-ordering the book through this crowdfunding campaign.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>As the artwork is already finished, this campaign is simply to help me with printing costs. I have set the goal at <strong>1500 Euro</strong> (you may see the amount in your local currency). This would cover for <strong>300 copies</strong>. If the goal is not fully reached, the amount of copies produced will be reduced accordingly. Similarly, more money will mean more copies ( and a happier artist).</li>
<li>I work with a local printer in Berlin to assure the best  quality in both paper and printing.</li>
<li>Once the campaign expires in November, production and shipping will start. So, depending on your location, you should be able to get your book somewhere in November or December.</li>
<li>I will make sure that all  books are shipped in time for christmas , in case you are considering it as a gift.</li>

<h3>J.P. PLACK &amp; EMI UTRERA PRESENT: ""EUDAIMONIA""</h3>
<p>EUDAIMONIA is a word from ancient Greek philosophy that means, ""the good life,"" the life that is worth living despite the inevitable pain and hardship of the human condition. It is something which all seek yet many are unable to find.</p>
<p>EUDAIMONIA is a multi-genre story that takes place between 1909-1959, featuring interwoven stories about a small town with a secret, a traumatized soldier in the trenches, a runaway girl with remarkable gifts, and a son not so prodigal. These seemingly disparate tales come to form the circular narrative, as characters claw their way towards their Eudaimonia.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560276813/uixdexpwyipl2mrtdoia.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>EUDAIMONIA #1: THE SECRETS WE KEEP, THE SONG IN OUR HEARTS</h3>
<p>'Eudaimonia: The Secrets We Keep, The Song in Our Hearts' is the first of three issues in the series. It consists of 30 full-color pages written and designed by me and drawn, colored, and lettered by the amazing Emi Utrera. The story is also told using (almost exclusively) third-person narrative verse. This unorthodox style is a deliberate homage to the many actual soldiers who fought in the war and composed poetry using this style.</p>

<h2>About this project.</h2>
<p>Hello. My name is Jon Sommariva. I would like to make a really nice, high quality art book that collects my work from the past few years. I need $3500 to make a small print run of this book. I will be offering some great perks for anyone who wants to contribute. I'm excited about keeping my contributors updated with photos of the perks as I get them done and progress reports on the design of the book itself. I also plan to show you some of the work that didn't make the cut for the book. <strong>Don't forget to click that Facebook ""like"" button above and help me spread the word about my book.</strong> Thank you!</p>

<p>I am Jon Sommariva. I'm a comic book artist and illustrator from <strong>Sydney, Australia.</strong> I have been working as a professional artist for the past 13 years or so. I have been published by <strong>Image Comics</strong>, <strong>DC Comics</strong> and <strong>Dakhorse Comics</strong> and I have also done design work for <strong>Disney.</strong> I love to draw, and I draw A LOT! Some of the things I draw are published and released into the world, while the majority is not. That is why I would like to create this book compiling my recent work which will allow me to share my art with you.</p>
<h3>Double the size, Double the fun. Tell me about the book!</h3>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to create the best version of Ozmosis Chills III for people across the world who want to own a copy of a book that collects my art. </p>
<p><strong>It will include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>new art previously unseen anywhere</strong></li>
<li><strong>commissions</strong></li>
<li><strong>con sketches</strong></li>
<li><strong>unpublished work</strong></li>
<li><strong>experiments</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All in various forms from thumbnails and sketches to inked and coloured works.</strong> </p>
<p>I want the book to have a real polished finish to it with high production values. My goal is for Ozmosis Chills III to be a much bigger and even better looking book than the first 2 volumes. The original books were A5 in size (that's roughy 5x8 inches for my friends in the U.S) and Ozmosis Chills III will be more than double the size of the last book in every way.</p>

<h3>History:</h3>
<p>You may have noticed that this is the 3rd Ozmosis Chills art book. I self published Ozmosis Chills and Ozmosis Chills II in 2008 and 2009, respectively. <strong>Both of these books have sold out. </strong>I published a small run of a preview edition of Ozmosis Chills III in 2011. <strong>This also sold out</strong> at <em>New York Comic Con</em> the same year. The version you are contributing to here will be a beefed up, slicker version of that book. As such, the cover artwork you see here will also be touched up slightly to help set this new version apart from the preview edition. As a contributor you will receive updates on the progress of the cover work.</p>
<h3>Talk is cheap! Let's see some of your art...</h3>
<p>For those unfamiliar, here are some examples of my art as well as a preview of the book layout. If you like this art, then you can expect much more of this on the pages of Ozmosis Chills III.</p>

<h2>Perks, Rewards and your Contributons.</h2>
<p>To make this book a reality, I need at least <strong>$3500</strong> to cover the initial design work and printing costs. This will also cover Indiegogo fees, as well as currency conversion. I am also absorbing some of the shipping cost here. The downside to living in beautiful Australia is that shipping gets very expensive to the rest of the world, so <strong>part of my goal is to keep the shipping reasonable for anyone outside Australia. </strong></p>

<p>Please help me get the word out there to anyone who YOU think might enjoy this book. All <strong>tweets, facebook posts and bloggings</strong> will make me eternally gratefull. A big THANKS to everyone who contributes to this campaign. I will be designing a special <em><strong>thankyou page</strong></em> in the book to acknowledge you guys.

Hello. My name is Jon Sommariva. I would like to make a really nice, high quality art book that collects my work from the past few years. I need $3500 to make a small print run of this book. I will be offering some great perks for anyone who wants to contribute. I'm excited about keeping my contributors updated with photos of the perks as I get them done and progress reports on the design of the book itself. I also plan to show you some of the work that didn't make the cut for the book. Don't forget to click that Facebook ""like"" button above and help me spread the word about my book. Thank you!

The title given to a series of art books featuring the work of Jon Sommariva.

Origin: early 1990's - term coined by Jon and his friend, Mark.

<p>          In the early part of the last century, when the Canadian National Railroad was building a bridge over Pelican Narrows just downstream of the town of Sioux Lookout, there was evidence found that a historical battle between the local Ojibway tribes and another tribe of first nations people had occurred.  According to local oral history, the Ojibway and Sioux tribes, longstanding trading partners and rivals in times of war, had played a game of cat and mouse on a trek through the boreal forest, until the Ojibway had finally taken a stand at a small bluff that later became known as Sioux Mountain.  Using that historical fact as a springboard, <span class=""caps""><b>THE</b></span><b> </b><span class=""caps""><b>LEGEND</b></span><b> OF </b><span class=""caps""><b>THE</b></span><b> </b><span class=""caps""><b>SUNSET</b></span><b> </b><span class=""caps""><b>PEOPLE</b></span> takes the idea a step further: as they travelled toward their final destination, this tribe of Ojibway encountered powers and beings unfathomable in nature and supernatural in appearance.  Using the story of the legend of Sioux Lookout to relay some of the best known myths and legends of the local Anishinaabe, Author-Illustrator Shawn Richter and painter Francesca Zambon create a rich, exciting tapestry which can be enjoyed by fans of historical fantasy from 7 to 77.</p>

<p>          This 180 page graphic novel tells the story of the young boy who escapes the Sioux devastation of his village and a hunter and maiden who rescue him. The boy is brought to their village and with his warning in mind, the Elders decide to flee the oncoming Sioux, in hopes of escaping a similar fate.  During their journey they encounter Spirits and other supernatural creatures, talking animals and even hear the voice of their creator.  There are many lessons to be learned about how to live in the world and what it means to walk a path that will engender the qualities that any Anishinaabe should aspire to: Wisdom, Courage, Humility, Truth, Honesty, Respect and Love.</p>

          In the early part of the last century, when the Canadian National Railroad was building a bridge over Pelican Narrows just downstream of the town of Sioux Lookout, there was evidence found that a historical battle between the local Ojibway tribes and another tribe of first nations people had occurred.  According to local oral history, the Ojibway and Sioux tribes, longstanding trading partners and rivals in times of war, had played a game of cat and mouse on a trek through the boreal forest, until the Ojibway had finally taken a stand at a small bluff that later became known as Sioux Mountain.  Using that historical fact as a springboard, THE LEGEND OF THE SUNSET PEOPLE takes the idea a step further: as they travelled toward their final destination, this tribe of Ojibway encountered powers and beings unfathomable in nature and supernatural in appearance.  Using the story of the legend of Sioux Lookout to relay some of the best known myths and legends of the local Anishinaabe, Author-Illustrator Shawn Richter and painter Francesca Zambon create a rich, exciting tapestry which can be enjoyed by fans of historical fantasy from 7 to 77.



          This 180 page graphic novel tells the story of the young boy who escapes the Sioux devastation of his village and a hunter and maiden who rescue him. The boy is brought to their village and with his warning in mind, the Elders decide to flee the oncoming Sioux, in hopes of escaping a similar fate.  During their journey they encounter Spirits and other supernatural creatures, talking animals and even hear the voice of their creator.  There are many lessons to be learned about how to live in the world and what it means to walk a path that will engender the qualities that any Anishinaabe should aspire to: Wisdom, Courage, Humility, Truth, Honesty, Respect and Love.

Hi!
I'm Clyde DeSouza, author of the hard sci-fi novel Memories with Maya, picked by Penguin|Randomhouse for a March 2015 print release, after the novel's successful debut on Amazon.The novel has been reviewed favorably on high profile sites such as iO9.com and Mashable and made it to the IEET's list of publications, sharing space with other noteworthy sci-fi novels.
But... This is about the 360 Motion Comic:
MAYA - the 360 motion novel/comic, is based on the screen-play adaptation of the book.
I'm excited to explore this uncharted land, the challenges, and rewards of visual storytelling in Virtual Reality.
The grammar and rules for this exciting medium have not yet been defined, and I'd like to reach out to you to make it happen, through MAYA.


MAYA the Story: 

MAYA is a story grounded in Hard science.
So, there are no Aliens, FTL, or Supermen and time-travel... oh wait! there is  a form of time travel, but only because it's backed up with science to show how.
The story shows how our lives are augmented by technology... from Long Distance Relationships (LDRs)  to what relationships will be like... even after death.  ""Dirrogates"" - Digital Surrogates interact with real people, in the real-world and human touch is simulated through haptics.
hard science backs all this, in the story.

(io9's review of Memories with Maya)
Getting back...
MAYA the motion novel will play back on devices such as Facebook's OCULUS RIFT, and the story will also play out IPADS / IPHONES / ANDROID devices as well as versions for various VR devices such as Sony's Morpheus and Samsung's Gear VR


(above: The Durovis Dive. Immersive VR for cellphones)
The hardware is not important... what is important is content, for this new medium of visual storytelling!

Why should you care?


After these devices come to market, then what? The content, mostly, will be games. Wouldn't it be great to be one of the first people involved in creating a new story medium that generations will look back to?

IT'S LIKE RE-INVENTING CINEMA!  Great stuff to tell your grandchildren some day!

There's an undeniably warm fuzziness that goes with doing something new and exciting in technology. If you've never experienced it before, or if you want to again... swallow the VR pill and jump right in!

The perks - Yes, there's hard candy for you! Look at the perks on the sidebar.

Most importantly, it is about being part of a collaborative effort to define a new language for visual storytelling. 
By donating to the project, it allows me the freedom to investigate more... to hire artists and programmers to make real... the ideas I've been toying with in my head.


Visual Storytelling ideas such as...

Interactivity - If you look at the main video again, you'll notice the scene starts with a dark room and Maya gazing out the window. 
This scene will have music and her thoughts voiced out... The rest of the room is dark, just as the Story-teller or, ""Director"" intends it.. However: If you turn your head (wearing the oculus rift) or turn your iphone/ipad, the lights switch on, allowing you to explore the room.


Depth of field - 

This is another technique i'm exploring and there are challenges to be overcome in doing it in Stereoscopic 3D and on a full 360 sphere. 
But - with your contribution and involvement, I can explore these by paying programmers and artists to bring these ideas to life and thus create a part of the language for immersive 360 motion novels.These are just two ""tools"",., there will be more, as the novel get's done.

Projected Finish Date:  December this year - 2014.

An example scene from Chapter 5:  as proof of concept, is below. This is not what a finished page of the motion comic will be, It was stitched together from 14 renderings.  Going forward, it won't be a practical way to create every ""page"" of the Motion novel this way, that's why I've chosen a Game Engine for the final product.

This location will need to be captured in stereoscopic 3D and full 360. The inclusion of ""Study street"" in the story serves a real world purpose - To inspire tech companies to look at how technology can help the under-privileged. Read about Study Street on the Novel's website.

  
Risks & Challenges

 Only a handful of companies... if indeed there are a handful, might be exploring this new medium of visual storytelling, and certainly none I know of are working on a 360 Motion Novel/comic.
Challenges will be in capturing Stereoscopic 3D 360 images of real-world locations that will form the background or ""set"" as the story plays out.
My experience in Stereoscopic 3D allows me to tackle these challenges confidently.
I should mention, my non fiction book ""THINK in 3D"" has been peer reviewed by some of the best 3D film-makers out there... from the 3D director of the movie ""HUGO"" to movies such as ""Wrath of the Titans""


Some of the reviews are on Amazon: ""Think in 3D""
When it comes to contributing to the language of 3D, terminology I've coined in 3D film-making have made their way into the 3D Dictionary published by Technicolor. 

Alright... but what about the PERKS!!
Yes the perks... There's interesting ways to be involved and get something back for your faith in the project. 
Please do pick one (or more) on the sidebar and let's make MAYA - the 360 motion comic!
 Some of you might like the project but can't contribute. You could still be a part of the project: 
Tweet the project - talk to your gamer friends! Writers aren't social creatures, but I'm sure your friends list is huge on Facebook, Google+ and other sites. Please use Indiegogo's share tools and spread the word!
Here's the indigogo address for Maya: http://igg.me/at/maya360
 
 I will be grateful for this gesture.",7.0,1,"1 Campaign

For an estimation of how much shipping will be, please check the shipping breakdown below!  This campaign Stretch Goals are based on the combined funds between Indiegogo and Kickstarter.A year ago, we launched the Kickstarter to print the first issue of Temerity: Sayonara, our creator-owned scifi comic, and it was a smashing success! We funded in less than 12 hours and unlocked a number of stretch goals with over 500 backers. In 4 weeks we made over 200% our funding goal. Since then we’ve been posting the comic online for free on Webtoons. In a matter of months Temerity gained a readership of over 50,000 with over a score over 9.6! The reader response has been incredible, and we are excited to finally launch the highly anticipated second issue!This project aims to fund the printing and shipping of the scifi comic: Temerity #2: The Runaway. This issue features 26 full color comic pages and will have a page dedicated to the backers of the project for making this book a reality. As we grow in funding, we will add content to this book including more guest art, extra side comics, and concept art.Missed out on issue #1? No worries, you can grab both issues during this campaign!The Story:The Daigen Project altered Taeru’s DNA when he was just four years old. Now he’s an 18-year-old super-soldier with formidable skills and hardly any experience with the outside world. When his best friend, Sky, suddenly disappears with no explanation, Taeru refuses to believe she’s actually dead. During an unexpected attack from the Enlightenment, Taeru uses the attack as a diversion to escape and search for her.But escape is not that easy. He finds himself aboard the Temerity and must now prove his worth to stay. But Captain Edith McKarmick knows harboring a Daigen could lead to the death of her crew. Will she turn him back over to the Daigen Project for a reward? Or risk being found by the Enlightenment, a radical organization that hunts down and kills his kind and anyone who protects them?Come enjoy the ride as comic artist Chad Hardin and writer Jemma M. Young combine their talents to tell one incredible story of mechas, brain hacking, and terrible pun t-shirts. The result is a high-adventure intergalactic romp with a heavy dose of humor and a whole lot of temerity.The art is by famed DC artist Chad Hardin - whose first real love was mecha, anime, and spaceships! Unlike his previously published works with crazy tight deadlines, Chad has taken his time to create a comic unlike anything you’ve ever seen. Every panel is a work of art taken to the next level by our fantastic colorist, Enrica Eren Angiolini.Here’s a challenge: Find a single panel in this comic that doesn’t look like a masterpiece. This won’t be a comic where you simply read the word bubbles and then place in a stack of other comics to be forgotten. Or CGCed in a piece of plastic to never be opened and crossing your fingers it’ll be worth something someday. This is a comic you’ll want to open and soak in the art and story over and over again.If your still skeptical after reading all of that, go read the comic for yourself! You can read it free on Webtoons HERE.During this campaign we will be offering several variant covers by other artists! These will all be available as add-ons during this campaign.We’ve got a handful of rewards for you to pick from that have copies of Temerity and some of our extras. Once you select your reward, you can then add on some of our amazing extras.We are offering all kinds of amazing add-ons during this campaign, including the first issue of Temerity if you missed out on our previous campaign! Some of these add-ons are unlimited but some are not! We’ll be adding new add-ons during the campaign as stretch goals unlock so be sure to keep an eye out for new rewards!As we hit higher funding amounts, we will be unlocking stretch goals! These stretch goals include free extras such updates to the book, bonus goodies in your package like stickers and pins, or unlock extra add-on merch that you can add to your reward at a discounted price. Stretch goals are based on the total funding between Kickstarter and Indigogo!Join CryptoComics to collect digital comics by creators like Jemma and Chad, follow them, hang out, and participate in events and giveaways. Read the comics you love and discover new, original stories with a community of other passionate readers and fans. Here’s a general breakdown on how much you can expect to pay for shipping based on what rewards and add-ons you pledge for. The base reward on the standard issue starts at 8 ounces including the shipping materials.International Shipments: Please make sure you are aware of your VAT tax, tariffs, and customs for your country! Every country is different so we can’t estimate how much these extra fees will cost. We also declare the full value of your shipment on the Customs forms. We will be shipping with USPS to cut down on handling fees from Fedex and UPS. Some of you may be asking yourself, “Why should I back this campaign when I can read the comic online for free?” While we do provide this comic for free, it’s something we can only work on during our free time. And our free time is pretty limited since we have to take on jobs that pay the bills! (Gotta feed our families or something like that!) When you pledge to this campaign, it’s helping support us as creators! If we can make enough on our campaign then we can use Temerity to pay the bills instead of something else! Which means that we can spend more time working on it and post updates more frequently with more content. Help turn our dream project into a sustainable one! Other Ways You Can HelpWhile we appreciate financial support, we understand that not everyone is in a place to donate money. But that’s not the only way you can support Temerity! Sharing our comic with friends and family is a great way to help. Follow us on social media such as Instagram and Twitter, and like, share, and commenting helps us get past gate-keeping algorithms and expand our reach. The more Temerity lovers there are out there, the more likely we are to hit our goals and create more content!Thank you for checking out Temerity: The Runaway. It’s because of people like you that these sorts of projects get to become a reality! We hope that you will help make this book real and help us reach our goal of making this our full-time job!Links:Temerity on Webtoons and InstagramChad Hardin on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and Patreon.Jemma M.

But when he's not being all regular, he's drawing comic books! Now if you love comic books as much as I do, then you know he's not exactly normal. His poor wife constantly wonders what's wrong with him when he geeks out over things like monsters and superheroes and other things that grown ups shouldn't like.

Yep, that fried pickle Q Cumbersome was just supposed to be a comic WE were reading in ""Scairy Tales"".

It's kinda like 'Calvin and Hobbes meets The Nightmare Before Christmas' because we get to meet weirdo monsters like the Snombies: reanimated snowmen that come back not for brains, but clothes!!!

So, they're doing a special version of our comics like the old school comics collections just like 'Garfield' or 'Calvin and Hobbes'! It's gonna cost around $1000 to get a full run of our comic strip episodes into enough collections to sell inexpensively. The idea is to have something families can enjoy without selling the farm! Every cent donated here on Indiegogo will go into printing our ""Scairy Tales"" comics just like it did with the pickle!</p><p>For any donation, we've got some nice PERKS for ya! Some are as simple as a heartfelt ""THANKS"", some artwork for you or even as GRAND as making you into a Moonrise MONSTER of your very own!</p><p>If we reach our goal and beyond, it will still all go to printing even more of our comics! <br/></p><h3>When does is happen?</h3><p>That's the coolest part.....this October marks the 5th YEAR of my comics!!! Yep, I started it all with a sketchbook in October 2010 doodling these kids, figuring out their world, how the monsters would fit in, what it would be called...everything!

Mounts, speaking for myself right now. Basically, Gus is me! I dream big and always have, just as little kids do. The economy is always suffering and that means we're all operating on shoestrings. That makes every cent in our homes important to us all. As an artist, being able to continue to bring joy and entertainment through the my comics means the world to me.

Mounts. Yeah, he spells 'scary' with an ""i"" so no one thinks these are horror comics but instead a combination word of 'scary tales' and 'fairy tales', comic made for the entire family!To tell you a little about J.R., he's a regular geek guy with a regular job and everything. But when he's not being all regular, he's drawing comic books! Now if you love comic books as much as I do, then you know he's not exactly normal. His poor wife constantly wonders what's wrong with him when he geeks out over things like monsters and superheroes and other things that grown ups shouldn't like. Still, she loves the big lug and supports him at every comic con he appears at trying to let everybody know about us, his characters!Indiegogo is giving J.R. the opportunity to help get us adventurous kids into to comic books! Sure, he draws them a lot but we haven't been professionally printed yet. You may know his other comic, ""Fried Pickle Noir"" which did very well here on Indiegogo and was actually his SECOND idea! Yep, that fried pickle Q Cumbersome was just supposed to be a comic WE were reading in ""Scairy Tales"". But the pickle took off and is all stuck up n' stuff now because HE's got the best looking books. Well, we kids wanna get even and show off ourselves too! Heck, we were first!Anyway, for those of you who don't know, ""Scairy Tales"" is a family friendly comic strip about little kids in a town called Sunset who dress up all year as superheroes and monsters, get picked on a lot and then discover REAL monster kids in the next town called Moonrise! It's kinda like 'Calvin and Hobbes meets The Nightmare Before Christmas' because we get to meet weirdo monsters like the Snombies: reanimated snowmen that come back not for brains, but clothes!!! Plus there's other monster kids like my best pal Moses, Lad Scientist, Hazl the witch, Fubar the octo-chef and more!Whadda we need?Well, here's the deal, J.R. has an awesome professional printer that did a great job on his comics for ""Fried Pickle Noir"" and we wanna look every bit as good as the pickle! So, they're doing a special version of our comics like the old school comics collections just like 'Garfield' or 'Calvin and Hobbes'! It's gonna cost around $1000 to get a full run of our comic strip episodes into enough collections to sell inexpensively. The idea is to have something families can enjoy without selling the farm! Every cent donated here on Indiegogo will go into printing our ""Scairy Tales"" comics just like it did with the pickle!For any donation, we've got some nice PERKS for ya! Some are as simple as a heartfelt ""THANKS"", some artwork for you or even as GRAND as making you into a Moonrise MONSTER of your very own!If we reach our goal and beyond, it will still all go to printing even more of our comics! When does is happen?That's the coolest part.....this October marks the 5th YEAR of my comics!!! Yep, I started it all with a sketchbook in October 2010 doodling these kids, figuring out their world, how the monsters would fit in, what it would be called...everything! So it's only fitting for the anniversary to have something BIG happen like this, and YOU can be a part of history!Why are these comics so important anyway? Hi gang, J.R. Mounts, speaking for myself right now. Basically, Gus is me! I dream big and always have, just as little kids do. The economy is always suffering and that means we're all operating on shoestrings. That makes every cent in our homes important to us all. As an artist, being able to continue to bring joy and entertainment through the my comics means the world to me. It's what I feel I was put on this earth for. But even doing your passion means we all need a little help sometimes. That's where campaigns like this come in. Every donation makes YOU a part of this ""Scairy Tales"" world, and boy I can't wait to show everyone how much fun it's going to be!Every comic convention I appear at, I'm lucky enough to touch the hearts and funny bones of anyone willing to give these characters a look whether they be kids or adults. Not only do they all like the idea, they want to see more. This is how I can give more to them.
