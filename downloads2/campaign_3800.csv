We're the Wasatch Wordsmiths, a Salt Lake City based non-profit that spreads and cultivates performance poetry throughout the valley.This year, our non-profit is supporting TWO SLC teams to get to the National Poetry Slam in Oakland, California. What's a poetry slam? A poetry slam is one of the most authentic and rowdiest places to share and experience poetry in a way that values the audience as well as the poet.  In addition to funding two teams with this money, we also put on poetry workshops throughout the Salt Lake Valley from high schools to after school programs. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Here are the costs we are looking at to get to Oakland: </p> <ul> <li>Registration ($1,000)</li> <li>Hotel Rooms for 12 people</li> <li>Enough gasoline to get four cars all the way to Oakland! </li>
<li>Food for us hungry poets!</li> </ul>
<div>In order to raise all the funds, we are willing to pay all you lovely people back in poetry! Some of our perks include personalized chapbooks, individualized poems, and Wasatch Wordsmiths merchandise. </div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>Not only do we want to represent you well, but we also want to bring valuable talent and knowledge back to Salt Lake City. National competitions allow us to attend workshops, promote our scene, but most importantly, grow as an artist by listening to others' work. In order to keep Salt Lake City a thriving hub for new and impactful art, we need to constantly be learning and listening. We promise to come back from Nationals as better informed poets, with a deep appreciation for craft. This is our second year sending 2 teams to Nationals, so let's keep the momentum going! And another reminder that your money funds us to grow as artists, but also to help the Salt Lake City youth grow, as we put together school workshops and programs! </div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> Fundraising our way to these national events is not easy. Each year, we must fundraise thousands of dollars to send our best poets to compete against much larger cities. It's very taxing on us emotionally, and most of us are working other jobs to support our craft. But we do this because we genuinely love poetry, and love being able to represent you with our best! The points are not the point at these competitions, the point is poetry, and we go to these competitions each year to share that with others. We thank you for all your continued support over the years. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>While we rely on financial donations from people such as yourself, we also welcome support in the form of attendance, promotion, passion, and your indiegogo shares!

<h3>SEWW At a Glance</h3>
<p>Southeastern Women's Wrestling (SEWW) is a group of female and female-identifying performers currently based in Athens, Georgia. Through spectacle, these bad ass babes are reclaiming the sport from hyper-masculinity and subverting sexualized stereotypes of females to promote a body-positive space free from the male gaze where fantasy alter egos can be constructed, cultivated, and performed.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521585631/kwtgkrwyf9kswq0mtd4a.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our campaign is important to us, because, hello??? Did you read the previous paragraph? We need to raise money for wrestling events that empower badass women. This is important to us as wrestlers and to you as viewers. Don’t you want to be part of an authentic uplifting space? Yeah we thought so, that’s why you’re here! WITH YOU we can cover costs of our wrestling ring, design and print posters to hang around town to increase hype (YEAH we have some badass artists/wrestlers that design our logo, t-shirts, posters, and zine pages), and to eventually obtain an LLC license, which would be a fancy way of saying we are officially legit. </p>
<p>If you donate, THANK YOU. You are awesome and because of that, we are all awesome together. Spread the word and MARK YOU CALENDAR FOR WRESTLEWOMANIA ON APRIL 28<sup>th</sup> (the next wrestling event, obviously. Did we mention you get into it for free if you donate $5 or more???).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Are you a math-nerd number crunching geek? Perfect! Here is where we break down the numbers for how the donations are distributed. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521585663/z59hb5ypq7sziru1d7n4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are raising money for our next three matches:</p>
<p>The most important part is the ring, this is $250 per day, with three matches that would be $750.</p>
<p>A professional wrestling license would help SEWW to continue to grow and develop by becoming an official organization, which in turn will provide more opportunities for crazy cool lady wrestling events in the Athens area! It costs $100 to apply for an LLC. (We’re at $850 now for all you math geeks).</p>
<p>Printing materials (ink, artist’s time, paper) for posters and zine articles. This will be about $100 for the three matches.</p>
<p>Sound system for wrestling events so you can listen to our BOSS announcer, Colette: $50.</p>
<p>IF we do not get full funds, wrestlers will pay out of pocket and be grateful for the amount that we did raise. AGAIN did we say THANKS yet for donating? Thanks, you’re the best.</p>
<h3>Let's Get Perky!</h3>
<p>Now you're probably asking yourself, ""Other than the joy of giving and potentially watching some strong folks kick each other's butts, what the frick else am I gettin out of this??!??""</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521585735/idhj26xgjnl95njdwvfw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Depending on the amount of your donation, we have a range of perk options!</p>
<p>At $3, you can get your hands on your own version of the SEWW title in sticker form to place wherever you see fit! </p>
<p>From $5 up, you get free admission to WrestleWomania!! WOOO!!!</p>
<p>In addition to free admission, other perks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a handprinted coozie or SEWW zine ($10 level)</li>
<li>SEWW t-shirt or pennant ($20 level)</li>
<li>Your name in the playbill + an SEWW cross stitch (limit 5) OR a relic from either a Heel (meanie) or Face (sweetie) wrestler in our crew ($50 level)!</li>
<li>A SIGNED, PERSONALIZED poster from your favorite wrestler ($75 level)(limit 10)!</li>
<li>A PERSONALIZED shout out on social media from either a Heel (meanie) or Face (sweetie) wrestler in our crew ($100 level) (limit 5)!</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521584380/xnip2ihg6asbjxt5tmpv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This project is valuable to the world, at least the Athens and surrounding areas world. As women, we are SICK AND TIRED of having the media, our peers and our partners, telling us how we are supposed to act, dress, talk, and express our gender or sexuality. SEWW allows women to explore their inner personality that is formed authentically, reflectively, and intentionally. Having women carry out this task, while having other people observe and also reflect, creates a better place for us all. We have put on 3 wrestling events in the past, and let me tell you, its fun and inspiring. So, let’s do this together!</p>
<h3>How Else Can You Help?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>If you’re on social media, SPREAD THE WORD. (I mean, if you’re not on social media how the hell did you get here?). Retweet, regram, repost, send an email, send a hand written letter to your grandma (you should do this regardless), talk about the coolness of SEWW at the water cooler, pass a note on a piece of toilet paper under a bathroom stall, get drunk at a bar and rant to strangers about how they should donate to SEWW’s indiegogo, get the QR code to this website tattooed on your forehead, or go to the library and place SEWW fliers inside random books. You’ll figure it out, you’re smart (that is why you donated, after all).</p>

If you donate, THANK YOU. You are awesome and because of that, we are all awesome together. Spread the word and MARK YOU CALENDAR FOR WRESTLEWOMANIA ON APRIL 28th (the next wrestling event, obviously. Did we mention you get into it for free if you donate $5 or more???).

What We Need
Are you a math-nerd number crunching geek? Perfect! Here is where we break down the numbers for how the donations are distributed. 

We are raising money for our next three matches:
The most important part is the ring, this is $250 per day, with three matches that would be $750.
A professional wrestling license would help SEWW to continue to grow and develop by becoming an official organization, which in turn will provide more opportunities for crazy cool lady wrestling events in the Athens area! It costs $100 to apply for an LLC. (We’re at $850 now for all you math geeks).
Printing materials (ink, artist’s time, paper) for posters and zine articles. This will be about $100 for the three matches.
Sound system for wrestling events so you can listen to our BOSS announcer, Colette: $50.
IF we do not get full funds, wrestlers will pay out of pocket and be grateful for the amount that we did raise. AGAIN did we say THANKS yet for donating? Thanks, you’re the best.
Let's Get Perky!
Now you're probably asking yourself, ""Other than the joy of giving and potentially watching some strong folks kick each other's butts, what the frick else am I gettin out of this??!??""

Depending on the amount of your donation, we have a range of perk options!
At $3, you can get your hands on your own version of the SEWW title in sticker form to place wherever you see fit! 
From $5 up, you get free admission to WrestleWomania!! WOOO!!!
In addition to free admission, other perks include:

a handprinted coozie or SEWW zine ($10 level)
SEWW t-shirt or pennant ($20 level)
Your name in the playbill + an SEWW cross stitch (limit 5) OR a relic from either a Heel (meanie) or Face (sweetie) wrestler in our crew ($50 level)!
A SIGNED, PERSONALIZED poster from your favorite wrestler ($75 level)(limit 10)!
A PERSONALIZED shout out on social media from either a Heel (meanie) or Face (sweetie) wrestler in our crew ($100 level) (limit 5)!

The Impact


This project is valuable to the world, at least the Athens and surrounding areas world. As women, we are SICK AND TIRED of having the media, our peers and our partners, telling us how we are supposed to act, dress, talk, and express our gender or sexuality. SEWW allows women to explore their inner personality that is formed authentically, reflectively, and intentionally. Having women carry out this task, while having other people observe and also reflect, creates a better place for us all. We have put on 3 wrestling events in the past, and let me tell you, its fun and inspiring. So, let’s do this together!
How Else Can You Help?

If you’re on social media, SPREAD THE WORD. (I mean, if you’re not on social media how the hell did you get here?). Retweet, regram, repost, send an email, send a hand written letter to your grandma (you should do this regardless), talk about the coolness of SEWW at the water cooler, pass a note on a piece of toilet paper under a bathroom stall, get drunk at a bar and rant to strangers about how they should donate to SEWW’s indiegogo, get the QR code to this website tattooed on your forehead, or go to the library and place SEWW fliers inside random books. You’ll figure it out, you’re smart (that is why you donated, after all).",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>About me</strong></p>
<p>I am an independent artist who recently went from full time to part time at my job so I could pursue my dream. One of my life goals is to be able to support my family with my artwork. Making these compact mirrors is one small step towards achieving that goal. I'm extremely passionate about my work and hope that one day I will be able to help people with my artwork and give it a purpose beyond just being something to look at.</p>
<p><strong>What I need</strong></p>
<p>The money I am fundraising will go towards the mirror machine, 250 mirrors and packaging for the finished project. I will be purchasing the mirror machine from buttonbiz.com because it is a well-made, quality product.</p>
<p><strong>Why the deadline</strong></p>
<p>I've been working as an artist since 2009, honing my skills and developing my style while working various jobs.</p>
<p>This August my work will be shown in a gallery show for the very first time! I would like to be able to have some merchandise for those who do not get the chance, or do not have the money, to buy a painting.</p>

</p><p><br/></p><h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>The 101 Vagina book is already published here in little old Australia, but I want to take it to the world, via America. For that I need some help!<br/><br/><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-publishing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Self-publishing</a> and organizing a book launch and exhibition tour has many costs associated with it. The biggest single expense is getting the books <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offset_printing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">offset-printed</a> locally for the book launch and tour. This is a HUGE OUTLAY for me. <br/><br/>By supporting this campaign you are effectively PRE-ORDERING your copy of the book, so that I can pay the printers. <br/><br/>You'll also SAVE MONEY since I'm offering the book at a discount price to supporters of this crowd-funding campaign.<br/><br/>I am getting the books printed locally (USA/Canada) to ensure the best quality, environmental standards and ethical practices are maintained. I also believe in local manufacturing to support local industry and jobs and cutting down on unnecessary transportation. 

<br/><br/>I am not financially backed by any organisation or publisher, meaning this project is free from any corporate interference or commercial/sponsor interests. Because I <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-publishing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">self-published</a> all costs associated with the entire project have been carried by myself. <a href=""http://taboo-books.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Taboo Books </a>is my own business name under which I self-published. Book sales are the only means I have of recovering costs to keep this amazing project going.<br/><br/>Once the tour is underway, sales of the 101 Vagina book will hopefully carry the expenses of the tour, but the initial outlay is huge. At this stage it looks like I'll need to sell around 1000 books over the duration of the tour just to break even.<br/><br/>(Note: Print on demand would be convenient because no initial outlay is required, but each book would then cost over $150. Offset printing produces higher quality images and is cheaper per copy, but to achieve those lower costs high volumes to be printed, and paid for, at once.)<br/><br/><h2>The Impact</h2>By supporting this crowd-funding campaign you are helping break down the vagina taboo and body image shame generally, by helping me get the book printed and keeping the exhibition tour on the road.<br/><br/>Beyond that, once printed, $5 from every book sold will <a href=""http://101vagina.com/giving-to-charity/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">go to charities</a> working towards ending violence towards women, or helping and healing survivors. This is inline with my having been inspired by Even Ensler's Vagina Monologues and her VDay Foundation.<br/><br/>I have had many people say to me that they wish this kind of work would be part of sex-education in schools, or that they were buying the book for their daughter or friend. If even only one person feels better about themselves through this project then it's all been worth while. <br/><br/>I am constantly buoyed by the positive feedback I get from people who have seen the book or visited an exhibition.<br/><br/>You can see what some people had to say about it here, for me this is really what it's all about.

Why a new multispectral Imaging system.

The identification of pigments in polychrome artworks and
archaeology is necessary to gain a deep understanding of the materials and the
painting technique applied. Conservators and art historians can use this
information to select the proper conservation procedures and to reconstruct the
artists’ workshop practices. In many cases, the application of non-invasive
techniques is mandatory since physical sampling of the art works is not
possible. Multispectral imaging systems are not invasive and are successfully used in art examination to map and identify artists’ materials (pigments
and binders) and to enhance the reading of old documents.  This is possible thanks to the different reflectance spectral features that characterize pigments. We propose to spread the use of this technology by developing a low-cost multispectral imaging system. If funded this project will benefit a transnational community of professionals involved in art conservation.     






System Features
We have a simple and sturdy system in mind!




made using commercially available parts (for less than $4000).

Senior Computer Scientist on Photoshop at Adobe Systems, Inc.""I really want to see this CHSOS project succeed.  Releasing a reasonably priced, usable, open source multispectral camera system will significantly advance adoption of multispectral techniques in art, archaeology, and other domains.""


Fabian Rasson, Belgium. Conservator, ORNAMENT CVBA. ""As an experienced conservator specialized in wall paintings and historic interiors I believe that we all welcome the ideas behind CHSOS. Certainly the practical implementation of an open source analytical imaging system is very appealing. So when I can contribute to the further development of a system that makes scientific diagnostics more accessible for us all, I do not hesitate.""




Angela Campbell, USA. Assistant
Conservator in Paper Conservation, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New
York, NY.“I have been following
Antonino’s work for the past five years, I trust his commitment to developing
an affordable Multispectral Imaging System, and I look forward to learning
about the results of this project.” 
Samantha Stout, USA. Ph.D. student in Materials Science and Engineering, UCSD.""The concepts of this imager tie directly into my dissertation research.  It's all about making the scientific diagnostics more accessible to art conservators and other professionals. Once we have a standardized way to document cultural artifacts, we can start health assessments and time monitoring to identify common threats and vulnerabilities to state of conservation. (Plus, I really need the pigments checker!)""

Athanasios Velios, UK. Reader in Digital Documentation, Ligatus, University of the Arts London and IIC webmaster.""Conservation is largely dominated by proprietary software solutions which slow down the development of new tools and limit the potential of learning. It is exciting to see open source becoming the focus of this project which will hopefully deliver a tool that other groups can build on."" 


Tim Zaman, The Netherlands. PhD Researcher, Delft University of Technology.“In cultural heritage imaging, there is a need for pragmatic pioneers that are passionate about giving the field easy access to scientific tools. Organizations like CHSOS fit this role, but the effort should be collaborative. Therefore have to give mutual support to promote and motivate.”


Antonio Martinez, Puerto Rico. Professor of Physics, University of Puerto
Rico.“I have been following
CHSOS for a while now and I am confident that they can bring this project to
fruition.  It is consistent with CHSOS initiatives to empower the members
of the Cultural Heritage community through training and pointing to
accessible instrumentation and techniques.""

Silvia Amato, UK. Conservation scientist, London.""I like and I believe in Antonino's ambition, his fresh ideas and his way of making them real. I support this project because I appreciate this new way of thinking the Multispectral Imaging for works of art: an easy and low-budget system available to anyone who needs useful and reliable data using non-destructive analyses. I want this project to grow up!"".
Moshe Caine, Israel. Head of Interactive Communications and New
Media, Hadassah Academic College, Jerusalem Conservation Imaging Technologies -
Haifa University Department of Archaeology.“Antonino has been at
the forefront of conservation imaging for many years and has a proven track
record in the field. I have been a follower of CHSOS and I trust their
commitment to make this project happen!”


Elena Mumford,  UK, Art Historian, London.“I have experienced Antonino's work first hand and cannot recommend him highly enough. This project is a breath of fresh air and a sign of reassurance for both researchers and collectors .""


Carsten Wintermann, Germany. paper conservator. www.papierrestaurierungdresden.de""I have been a follower of CHSOS and I trust their commitment to make this project happen! It is a very amazing project and i like this project very much. I wish you success.""
Gema Grueso, Spain. Conservator, Museo Nacional Reina Sofía.""I'm very excited to see where your project is going. I can't foresee what kind of opportunities this crowdfunding campaign is opening, not only for the goals of this particular project but for the way the professionals approach our conservation field. Open source, crowdfunding, networked communities, we need to implement all these 21st century dynamics in our professional workflow! I'm convinced that such initiatives can bring major changes of perspective and actually improve the way things get done.""


Paolo Triolo, Italy. Imaging specialist, Venaria Reale, Turin.""CHSOS is the best solution for sharing ideas and new solutions for multispectral diagnostics for culturale heritage!""
Alexandr Nikityaev, Russia. CTO, Tula city""Антонию делает замечательный проект, распространение которого позволит использовать современные технологии энтузиастам и профессионалам доступными по деньгам куда большему количеству людей без бесконечных ожиданий финансированя со стороны государства. Вы себе представьте, что какой нибудь музей под Тулой В.Д. Поленова или военно медицинский музей Санкт Петербурга, сможет заново открывать тайны картин или тексты рукописи Залмана Градовского, члена зондеркомандо, рукопись которого была найдена в пепле возле крематория в Аушвиц-Биркенау. Она до сих пор хранит тайныи в силу низкой читаемости без специального оборудования""""Antonio make very beautiful project. Available technology allow many enthusiast or professionals reopen many secrets. Imaging some museum under Tula like V.D Polenov or manuscript of Zalman Gradowski in Military Medical Museum in St. Petersburg. In case of  V.D Polenov we can study more about this painter. In case of Zalman Gradowski we can read text of direct holocaust witness. His manuscripts were found near crematorium in Auschwitz Birkenau ""
Kaoru Suemori, Japan. Researcher, Center for Cultural Resources, National Museum of Ethnology (Minpaku), Osaka, Japan""This project has a lot of possibilities for contributing to the examination of art works. In addition, this low cost techniques could be applied to many kinds of collection care methods.  I would like to follow the progress of this project.""
Valentina Ferro, UK. PhD Candidate, University of Dundee.""Contributing to new creative ideas in the field of applied physics is always exciting. As a researcher, I believe that this CHSOS project has everything it needs to bring an effective world-spreading tool to the cultural heritage community.""
Elisa Di Stefano, Italy. Researcher at Italian Institute for
Astrophysics. “The
development of low cost instrumentation supported by the experience will be
very helpful for all the people that have a low budget and want operate in the
field of Art and Archeology.”",5.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Hello and thank you for visiting my Indiegogo page!  </h3>
<p>I'm Amanda Martin, a 4th generation San Francisco native, a 14 year resident of the Bernal-Glen neighborhood, and a real estate agent with BarbCo Real Estate Group (aka Barbagelata, one of the oldest family run brokerages in San Francisco, since 1952) License #01386284. I have a deep love for San Francisco and am excited to kick off this small project to continue to bring community art to our beautiful and diverse neighborhoods!</p>
<p>It has been a dream of mine for the past 5 years to get a mural going in Glen Park. It's been a long road to get here (first looked into getting the mural painted on the side of Buddies Market, but after years of unsuccessful attempts to contact the owner of the building I gave up on that plan, Eventually I was connected with the Hayes family who own the property at 2852 Diamond St. and they were enthusiastic about the project, and have generously offered up the wall on the Kern Alley on the side of Pebbles Cafe for this project.</p>
<p>Here's a mock up of what the mural will look like on the wall:</p>

<p>I knew from the beginning that Amos Goldbaum (amosgoldbaum.com) would be the perfect artist for this project and we have been in contact for years now putting together the right artwork. The final artwork for the mural was inspired by this historical photo of Glen Canyon from 1942 (courtesy of OpenSFHistory.org).

<p>Of course, there will be respect for each characters´s moves and skills so then the created fatalities will make sense and, still, I wanna to see them impress people around to see how they could work in a ""original game"" if the characters had the opportunity to be portraited with this level of violence someday</p>

<div><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#330000"" size=""3"">Modern Mythology is seeking to crowdsource funding through IndieGoGo in order to keep publishing thought-provoking pieces on pop culture philosophy and social commentary, and to keep expanding our audience. These funds will not only help us keep running, but also allow us to establish a podcast and classroom style series that could be of great use to anyone struggling in a chaotic world. </font></div>
<div><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#330000"" size=""3""><br/></font></div>
<div><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#330000"" size=""3"">There are tons of old, dead philosophers with books enshrined in the academic sphere. Modern Mythology takes a hammer and chisel to the ""ivory tower"" idea of academic research--the pantheon of philosophers of the past--and carves the voices of the new generation, sublime and ridiculous, into the side of that shrine, part graffiti, part sculpture, part literature, part philosophy, but in all cases <i>necessary </i>in order to truly explore the worlds we live in. </font></div>

</div>
<div><i><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#330000"">Many of us at Modern Mythology have been at this a long time. ModernMythology.net started out as my personal blog in 2005. In 2006, P. Emerson Williams, Michael Szul, Tovarich Pizor and I joined forces to create Mythos Media, a platform for the production of modern myths that might slip through the cracks or be dismissed by mass-media publishers and outlets. This was my third full-out attempt at helping to germinate an indie media collective. (Previous ones have led to shared A/V production facilities that are no longer in existence, this one was more focused on virtual platforms due to the lower overhead.) <br/></font></i></div>
<div><i><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#330000""><br/></font></i></div>
<div><i><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#330000"">Many years of hard work followed, where we produced and released books, comics, illustrated books, audio books with dedicated original soundtracks, albums, and collaborated a great deal with many other creative groups and production companies. Pictured above were our releases prior to 2009. </font></i></div>
<div><i><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#330000""><br/></font></i></div>
<div><i><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#330000"">Since then we made the concerted decision to maintain Mythos Media as a brand representing quality, off the path content. Anyone involved can forge their relationships with whatever publishing or distribution approach best suits their project, as Mythos Media is no longer a publisher itself.

</div></div>","Our Story
Modern Mythology is seeking to crowdsource funding through IndieGoGo in order to keep publishing thought-provoking pieces on pop culture philosophy and social commentary, and to keep expanding our audience. These funds will not only help us keep running, but also allow us to establish a podcast and classroom style series that could be of great use to anyone struggling in a chaotic world. 

There are tons of old, dead philosophers with books enshrined in the academic sphere. Modern Mythology takes a hammer and chisel to the ""ivory tower"" idea of academic research--the pantheon of philosophers of the past--and carves the voices of the new generation, sublime and ridiculous, into the side of that shrine, part graffiti, part sculpture, part literature, part philosophy, but in all cases necessary in order to truly explore the worlds we live in. 


Help us keep this literary and mental machine going by contributing and get some perks as a thank you!Our History

Many of us at Modern Mythology have been at this a long time. ModernMythology.net started out as my personal blog in 2005. In 2006, P. Emerson Williams, Michael Szul, Tovarich Pizor and I joined forces to create Mythos Media, a platform for the production of modern myths that might slip through the cracks or be dismissed by mass-media publishers and outlets. This was my third full-out attempt at helping to germinate an indie media collective. (Previous ones have led to shared A/V production facilities that are no longer in existence, this one was more focused on virtual platforms due to the lower overhead.) 

Many years of hard work followed, where we produced and released books, comics, illustrated books, audio books with dedicated original soundtracks, albums, and collaborated a great deal with many other creative groups and production companies. Pictured above were our releases prior to 2009. 

Since then we made the concerted decision to maintain Mythos Media as a brand representing quality, off the path content. Anyone involved can forge their relationships with whatever publishing or distribution approach best suits their project, as Mythos Media is no longer a publisher itself. You will likely continue to see products popping up here and there, eBooks and paperbacks, DVDs and albums, that have our logo on it. You can take that as you will, but:

In February 2011, Modern Mythology.net was opened up as a group endeavor, a site dedicated to maintaining a platform for the discussion of mythology and the independently produced media that follows from this discussion. Anyone involved can forge their relationships with whatever publishing or distribution approach best suits their project. If you join, we don't own your shit: you own your shit. Make it good.

Since February, the site very quickly grew to a steady 20,000 - 30,000 visitors a month, all coming to investigate original content on mythology crossing and incorporating many supposedly disparate disciplines: art, writing, linguistics, philosophy, anthropology, systems theory, psychology, film. While this many visitors doesn’t represent a huge marketing success, as many world-class blogs such as Huffington Post easily see more than that many visitors in a day. However, when you consider the subject matter and our approach, it seems to indicate an interest in what is a rather enigmatic subject.

This project began a creative collective, and it remains one, for all of those who are interested in joining and driven enough to play on the level. --James Curcio

The Impact
Framing myth in this light makes the discussion of the subject anything but “coffeeshop talk.” Modern myth is on the lips, minds, and knife-points of those in the midst of active revolution, as well as those working in media. In fact, all that is represented, all that we could form an opinion on as we form an opinion on it, is in that process entering the realm of myth. 

Our over-arching goal is to show people how important myths and narratives are in their lives, and to help give them a tool-kit to better navigate this literary understanding of consciousness. See http://www.modernmythology.net/p/what-is-modern-myth.html to get a better sense of the scope of this project.

<p> </p>
<p>My name is Brandie Maddalena; I am a social sculptor and installation artist. <em>The Nature of a Door is to be Opened</em> (TNDO) came about after my husband and I attended a lecture on memory and the vulnerability of memory distortion by influences like: family photos, retold stories, and the ever-present passage of time. Much of the following evening we spent reflecting on the questionable reality of our childhood memories and ultimately the conversation turned to what will our young children remember from their experiences. For days after, I brewed on the topic a came to the conclusion that those small moments of our childhoods make up the rich tapestries of our lives, a true common ground experience that could be shared thoughout a community. The idea settled into the form of an installation of cabinets, voices, art, and video, however the process of creating the installation would unite and empower a community.</p>
<h3><span style=""font-family: 'courier new';""> Installation</span></h3>
<p>Walking into TNDO, one will see 60 varying sized cabinets, fitted together in a puzzle-like formation, utilizing a wide variety of salvaged cabinet doors. This collection of individually unique pieces will be stacked up to 5 feet tall against the walls. Above them, a series of silent videos of children playing will be projected on the walls. To allow the projections to be seen, the upper part of the room will be dim and the cabinets will be lit individually with low wattage bulbs. Upon opening any of the cabinet doors, one will hear an audio recording of a young child (6 to 12-years-old) recounting her or his favorite memory. Another, older child (13 to 17-year-old) will create a visual art piece inside the cabinet to complement the young storyteller’s memory. At any given moment, several viewers will be interacting with the installation simultaneously, creating a hushed meshing or overlapping of children’s voices telling the stories. The voices will complement the projected videos of the children playing, all of whom having collaborated on the installation.</p>
<h3><strong><span style=""font-family: 'courier new';"">Process</span></strong></h3>
<p>Working with the nonprofit, Young Audiences of San Diego (YASD) and their networks provides great access to the organizations and individuals who are helping to create this piece. The process of creating the installation will require interpersonal connections and collaboration between several subsets of the stakeholders. They are: artists and the children, artists and the nonprofits, nonprofits with each other, and the children with the nonprofits. I am framing the lateral unification of these combinations as a social sculpture, modeling a more constructive paradigm for community development.<br/><br/><strong><span style=""font-family: 'courier new';"">Selecting a Population and Site</span></strong><br/><br/> With the assistance of YASD, I am working with students in City Heights elementary, middle, and high schools. I chose City Heights because is a clearly under-represented and underserved community; it is my home. I will site the installation within the neighborhood as an accessible source of pride, empowerment, and inspiration for the children, their families, and their community. We have contacted managers of potential sites, including City Heights/Weingart Library, City Heights Recreation Center, Price Charities (regarding vacant storefronts).</p>
<p><br/><strong><span style=""font-family: 'courier new';"">Recording Memories</span></strong><strong><br/></strong><br/> A YASD artist teacher is teaching a series of story telling workshops with students (ages 6-to-12) at Central Elementary School, focusing on teaching students to recount their favorite memories in narrative form. The young storytellers will retell their memories to produce an audio recording, which they can take home on a CD. A panel of judges and I will select 60 of the most intriguing stories. The subsequent recording will be heard upon opening the door of each individual cabinet of the installation.<br/><br/><strong><span style=""font-family: 'courier new';"">Visual Art for Cabinet Interiors</span></strong><br/><br/> Skilled young artists (ages 13-to-17) will be chose one memory to inspire them to create complementary works inside sleeves, made to fit the interior space of the cabinets. The pieces will use a diverse variety of traditional media, as well as elements such as scents, temperatures, kinetics, video, and the tactile. The students will be guided through the project by their art teachers and me – at Wilson Academy, Hoover High School, Urban Discovery Academy, and JCS San Diego Academy.<br/><strong><br/><span style=""font-family: 'courier new';""> Video and Picnic</span><br/></strong><br/> After the workshops are entirely complete, I will invite all of the participants and their families to a picnic at City Heights’ Teralta Park to further unite the project community and foster socializing, networking, and cultivating friendships.

<p><b>The Inspiration</b></p>
<p>This set of cards was inspired by conversations with friends about 
how our cycles harmonize with what's going on in nature around us.  I 
wanted to visualize these connections, so I created an image for each 
phase of the menstrual cycle, one for each season, and one for each 
lunar phase.  I created the images by collaging photographs of fabrics.</p>
<p>The
 images will be published as 2"" x 6"" cards, Tarot-style, so they can be laid out
 in various ways to reflect each woman's experience.  They can also be used as bookmarks.</p>

<br/><p>The
 booklet is written with young women in mind.  It contains meditation 
prompts and information about how each phase may influence our emotions 
and stimulate spiritual growth.  It is not a complete guide to the

 purpose of the trip is to bring a sound installation produced by myself
 and other Mass Art students to Edinburgh, Scotland to initiate an 
artistic exchange and relationship between the SIM department at Mass 
Art and the media programs at the Edinburgh College of Art (part of the 
University of Edinburgh). The exchange would begin in Boston with a 
composition specifically produced for the installation, which would then
 be installed in Edinburgh by me. I will then collaborate with and 
invite the artistic community there to respond in kind with their own 
interpretation for the installation, which would then be brought back 
and installed in Boston. This project has three key objectives: to gain 
greater exposure for and deepen the relevance of new media practices to 
contemporary art and life; to initiate a long-term artistic relationship
 between two significant institutions of art; to further my own work as a
 sound artist and designer by necessarily involving interaction and 
multi-sensory experience.</span><span id=""internal-source-marker_0.6553128161121691"" style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;""><br/></span></p>

that control the aural dimension of the piece, the dis-embodied 
performers become re-embodied by their audience. This calls particular 
attention to questions of presence and absence of the body in

Summary</strong></h2>
<p>The Memphis Poetry Slam Team
better known as <b>The</b> <b>P.E.O.P.L.E.</b> (<b>P</b>oets
<b>E</b>mbodying <b>O</b>nly <b>P</b>erfected <b>L</b>ive <b>E</b>ntertainment) needs
your help to send six amazing poets to the <strong><span>Southern Fried Poetry Slam</span></strong> this June
in Greenville, SC! Our journeys have all come together to take Memphis back to
a place where we have not gone in over a decade. We have been writing together,
performing at open mics, and competing to earn our spot on the team. Now the time
is here, we are rehearsing, spending time away from families, editing our
poems, and preparing them to get ready for the regional stage. We are so
excited to represent Memphis, TN the home of the blues in SC but we need to
help to raise the money to get ourselves there before we have the blues.</p>
<p>Attending Southern Fried Slam
is about more than competition. Though it will be exciting to go head-to-head
with other poets and showcase the content of the writing that we are so proud
of, Southern Fried is about the journey. We are a diverse group of fathers,
mothers, broken homes, lost friends, rookie competitors, religions,
backgrounds, and lifestyles. What is absolutely special is that this journey
has bonded us to the art. It is an opportunity to be exposed to all kinds of
poets, new ways of expressing ourselves, and to see if we can conquer the
stage. We will come home even more excited about this art form and its
possibilities to share with the next generation of slam poets to start a legacy
and true revitalization of the slam scene in Memphis.</p>
<p>The main expenses for our trip
are registration, transportation, and lodging. Registration has been paid for
out of our own pockets. We are also covering our meals, pooling our resources
for practice space and travel. We are working individuals whom understand the
value of the dollar. Your contribution to the campaign will go directly to
expenses for travel and lodging and will open the way for us to reach the goal
we've worked towards since our formation.</p>
<h2><strong>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>Our goal for fundraising is to
raise $2,000 in one month. Registration cost $350 (which we paid ourselves) As
of now, the most budget efficient method of travel is a passenger van. But the
cost of gas and rental are expensive. </p>
<p>To make it to Southern Fried
with our 6 person team, we need to account for:</p>
<p>Passenger van rental + gas :
$900</p>
<p>Accommodations: $1668</p>
<p>Registration: $350</p>
<p>____________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Total: $2918</p>
<p>We have made installments as a
unit to participate as a representative and collaborative effort. Any
additional funds, we raise will go to feeding us while we're there and then to
providing a workshop to develop and encourage the next year’s team. </p>
<p>We hope that the chance to help
send six poets to a national poetry event is a reward in itself, but beyond our
unending gratitude, there are some other perks for all you generous P.E.O.P.L.E
out there aiming to support some dream chasers. </p>
<h2><strong>The
Impact</strong></h2>
<p>Spoken word poetry is one of
many branches of the ancient oral tradition. Young and old alike are empowered
to speak their own truths and also learn to listen to what other people are
trying to convey. That is true COMMUNICATION and true UNITY, which for The
P.E.O.P.L.E. equates to COMMUNITY. Yes, competing on a national scale is a
wonderful endeavor, but our ultimate goal is present our city in a positive
light and show the world that Memphis is STILL viable factor in the poetry.</p>
<p>We haven’t gone anywhere. We
have been here all along.  Now is the
time for the world to see what we have known all along. Good things come from
Memphis TN!</p>
<h2><strong>Other
Ways You Can Help</strong></h2>
<p>And of course, there are other
ways to support our effort without money! Our fans, friends and families can
help by spreading the word about our campaign to people they know. Use your social
media site accounts (Facebook, Twitter, InstaGram, etc…), smoke signals or
whatever and let the world know what  The
P.E.O.P.L.E. are doing and how they can help. IndieGoGo even has
“share” tools, to facilitate the passing along of this awesome (and historic)
campaign.</p>
<p>Thank you SO much for your
help. Without the audience, there would be no poetry slam. We are writing for
you!<br/><br/>
Please stay tuned for updates from our team! We're so excited to share our work
with you.</p><br/><p></p></div>","Short

has bonded us to the art. It is an opportunity to be exposed to all kinds of
poets, new ways of expressing ourselves, and to see if we can conquer the
stage. We will come home even more excited about this art form and its
possibilities to share with the next generation of slam poets to start a legacy
and true revitalization of the slam scene in Memphis.
The main expenses for our trip
are registration, transportation, and lodging. Registration has been paid for
out of our own pockets. We are also covering our meals, pooling our resources
for practice space and travel. We are working individuals whom understand the
value of the dollar. Your contribution to the campaign will go directly to
expenses for travel and lodging and will open the way for us to reach the goal
we've worked towards since our formation.
What
We Need & What You Get
Our goal for fundraising is to
raise $2,000 in one month. Registration cost $350 (which we paid ourselves) As
of now, the most budget efficient method of travel is a passenger van. But the
cost of gas and rental are expensive. 
To make it to Southern Fried
with our 6 person team, we need to account for:
Passenger van rental + gas :
$900
Accommodations: $1668
Registration: $350
____________________________________________________________________
Total: $2918
We have made installments as a
unit to participate as a representative and collaborative effort. Any
additional funds, we raise will go to feeding us while we're there and then to
providing a workshop to develop and encourage the next year’s team. 
We hope that the chance to help
send six poets to a national poetry event is a reward in itself, but beyond our
unending gratitude, there are some other perks for all you generous P.E.O.P.L.E
out there aiming to support some dream chasers. 
The
Impact
Spoken word poetry is one of
many branches of the ancient oral tradition. Young and old alike are empowered
to speak their own truths and also learn to listen to what other people are
trying to convey. That is true COMMUNICATION and true UNITY, which for The
P.E.O.P.L.E. equates to COMMUNITY. Yes, competing on a national scale is a
wonderful endeavor, but our ultimate goal is present our city in a positive
light and show the world that Memphis is STILL viable factor in the poetry.
We haven’t gone anywhere. We
have been here all along.  Now is the
time for the world to see what we have known all along. Good things come from
Memphis TN!
Other
Ways You Can Help
And of course, there are other
ways to support our effort without money! Our fans, friends and families can
help by spreading the word about our campaign to people they know. Use your social
media site accounts (Facebook, Twitter, InstaGram, etc…), smoke signals or
whatever and let the world know what  The
P.E.O.P.L.E. are doing and how they can help. IndieGoGo even has
“share” tools, to facilitate the passing along of this awesome (and historic)
campaign.
Thank you SO much for your
help. Without the audience, there would be no poetry slam. We are writing for
you!
Please stay tuned for updates from our team! We're so excited to share our work
with you.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>Kente Cloth</strong></h2>
</div>
<p>Kente cloth is one of the most treasured textiles in all of Africa.  It has traditionally been worn by kings, chiefs and queen mothers’ during celebrations, ceremonies, and other important events.  There are hundreds of kente patterns, each with a unique meaning.  The tradition of weaving is generally passed from generation to generation within the same family.  This labor intense process produces a tightly woven patterned fabric still used by village leaders to this day.  Popularity of the fabric has led to many contemporary uses including clothing, bags, and wall décor to name a few.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello world!</p>
<p>I am Georgios Ernesto Mourelatos, actor, theatre director and writer. Many of you know me personally or are familiar with my work.</p>
<p>If not or to refresh your mind, take a look here: <a href=""http://giorgosmourelatos.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://giorgosmourelatos.com</a>.</p>
<p>For the past 31 years I was living in Greece, where I was involved with what I absolutely love in life, arts. Last year I decided to move to London, to chase my dream for personal and artistic development, to find new ways of expression and widening my knowledge in arts. Also to study about researching new ways of artistic expression.</p>
<p>Moving to London means having a difficult life. The cost of life is enormous. Food is ok but the rent, the bills, the taxes are quite difficult to manage. For example, my rent is 415 pounds per month, bills are 200 pounds per month (eating/heating etc), transpot is 140 pounds per month, coucil tax is 100 pounds per month and other expenses such pocket money is what is left from my monthly payment. I can manage with dignity and pride thus I am really proud about that. And all this in about 4 months time starting from zero.</p>
<p>I have to work 12 hours per day in all sorts of jobs and works, so I can afford my staying here. I do not mind working and I do not mind being exhausted. Though, I did not come here to be magnificent at a restaurant work. I came here to advance in art. One of the things I was planning to do arriving in the UK is to publish my written work. My play, called ""A Stone in the Water"", is my next book to be published. Also, besides this I have all sorts of stuff in mind as my next projects. </p>
<p>For creating my new book, which is about deafness, and doing everyday artistic and not only tasks, a strong computer is required. Unfortunately, I only have a small netbook, which can barely make it through simple processes, for example opening chrome tabs. So, I find myself in desperate need of a new computer, that will help me not only finish and publish my new book but will also allow me to continue doing so in the future. It will be a great help with my university studies, here in the UK as well.</p>
<h3>My Previous Two Published Books</h3>
<p>So far, I have published two poetry books, both in Greek. This one, ""A Stone in the Water"", will be in both English and Greek. Please, take a look on the links below:</p>
<ul>

</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>Living in London is really difficult and expensive. I cannot bear the cost of a new or even a used computer. I need to gather some funds so I can afford one. And for this, I could really use your help.</p>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>Your help is and will be really appreciated. </p>
<p>I am not asking for much. Even 1 pound is enough. Though, by donating one of the following ammounts below, you will be getting some small presents by me. :)</p>
<p>(P.S. you can donate in euros or dollars as well. The conversion happens automatically.)</p>
<ul>
<li>By donating <strong>1 pound</strong>, you will be getting my new book in an e-book format, in the language of your preference (Greek or English). </li>
<li>By donating <strong>10 pounds</strong>, you enlist for my next 5 books, in an e-book format, in the language of your preference (Greek or English).</li>
<li>By donating <strong>20-49</strong> pounds, you will receive my next 10 books in an e-book version, in the language of your preference (Greek or English).</li>
<li>By donating <strong>50-99 pounds</strong> you will be getting a real, signed copy of my book to your address, in the language of your preference (Greek or English).-</li>
<li>By donating <strong>100 pounds or more</strong> you will be getting a real, signed copy of my book to your address, in the language of your preference (Greek or English) and a lifetime subscription of my books, in an e-book format.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">A Promise</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>For all of you that know me, you already know I am not a person that asks for things. It is really difficult for me and took me a lot of time to finally go through with this campaign.</p>
<p>For those of you that do not know me personally, you might find it as a weird request. You might not trust me enough to help me. What I can say about me is that  I am just an artist trying to find his way and his tools for creating genuine art. How would someone describe me:</p>
<div class=""container-inner"">
<div class=""post clearfix"" id=""post-32"">
<p id=""top""><em>""He is a passing shadow amongst people, trying to leave some kind of a footprint…""</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I personally promise to you that any funds gathered from this campaign will solely be used for the purpose of acquiring a new laptop computer. And by that I do mean solely.<br/><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You might not be able to contibute to my campaign with a donation. It is understandable. This doesn’t mean you cannot help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please get the word out and make some noise about my campaign.</li>
<li>Feel free to use the Indiegogo share tools for that but also facebook, twitter and anything else you might think it would a good idea.</li>
<li>Help me reach my goal and get a new computer, so I can continue my artistic work!</li>
</ul>
<p>And many thanks for taking the time to read my long description. </p>
</div>
<p>Please, remember to spread the word about my campaign, to friends, family and the rest of the world!</p></div>","Short Summary

What I Need
Living in London is really difficult and expensive. I cannot bear the cost of a new or even a used computer. I need to gather some funds so I can afford one. And for this, I could really use your help.
How You Can Help
Your help is and will be really appreciated. 
I am not asking for much. Even 1 pound is enough. Though, by donating one of the following ammounts below, you will be getting some small presents by me. :)
(P.S. you can donate in euros or dollars as well. The conversion happens automatically.)

By donating 1 pound, you will be getting my new book in an e-book format, in the language of your preference (Greek or English). 
By donating 10 pounds, you enlist for my next 5 books, in an e-book format, in the language of your preference (Greek or English).
By donating 20-49 pounds, you will receive my next 10 books in an e-book version, in the language of your preference (Greek or English).
By donating 50-99 pounds you will be getting a real, signed copy of my book to your address, in the language of your preference (Greek or English).-
By donating 100 pounds or more you will be getting a real, signed copy of my book to your address, in the language of your preference (Greek or English) and a lifetime subscription of my books, in an e-book format.

A Promise


For all of you that know me, you already know I am not a person that asks for things. It is really difficult for me and took me a lot of time to finally go through with this campaign.
For those of you that do not know me personally, you might find it as a weird request. You might not trust me enough to help me. What I can say about me is that  I am just an artist trying to find his way and his tools for creating genuine art. How would someone describe me:


""He is a passing shadow amongst people, trying to leave some kind of a footprint…""


I personally promise to you that any funds gathered from this campaign will solely be used for the purpose of acquiring a new laptop computer. And by that I do mean solely.


Other Ways You Can Help
You might not be able to contibute to my campaign with a donation. It is understandable. This doesn’t mean you cannot help:

Please get the word out and make some noise about my campaign.
Feel free to use the Indiegogo share tools for that but also facebook, twitter and anything else you might think it would a good idea.
Help me reach my goal and get a new computer, so I can continue my artistic work!

And many thanks for taking the time to read my long description. 

Please, remember to spread the word about my campaign, to friends, family and the rest of the world!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Summary - Mobile Visionary Art Temple</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><b>The <b>iTemple Voyager</b> is the concept of a
traveling exhibit of spiritual and healing art from nationally recognized,
Oregon-based, artist Aaron Michael Pyne. The traveling exhibit will include a large scale outdoor Visionary Art gallery, meditation workshops, projections, chill space, and energy healing sessions. The temple will also include a marketplace of spiritual and holistic products for sale.  Each community visited by the
iTemple Voyager will be exposed to a new, deeper, spirituality through it's offerings.</b></p><b>
</b><p style=""text-align: center;"">The iTemple Voyager will be Aaron Pyne’s widest reaching expression yet. <b></b></p><p><b>The goal is to take the exhibit to as many places as possible , including art, music and spirituality festivals in Washington, Oregon, and California. After our first run this summer, we intend to find avenues to take the iTemple further heading east across the country to festivals.</b></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">

Michael Pyne</i><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>Over
the last 11 years I have worked to share my understanding of basic
spiritual truths and practices through various creative channels. I
have done web, graphic, and video design for large and small scale
spiritual and holistic businesses. I have created more than 140 visionary
pieces of art  that are encoded with spiritual symbolism to serve as
portals for the viewer to access their own inner divinity. My artwork
has been featured in shows, events, and magazines across the country.
I have taught a wide variety of meditation styles including: breath
work, chakra work, advanced energy healing techniques, spiritual dance, shamanic
journeying and other various formats to access one’s spirit guides,
angelic guides, and other multi-dimensional beings. I am trained and certified in a variety of energy healing/holistic moralities. I also avidly
promote the ability for each individual to access the infinite divine
potential within them. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently
in my home town of Bend, Oregon I have started the iTemple – a
community gathering space where I have been hosting a variety of
spiritual events including:</p>
<p>
</p><p>•
Ecstatic Free Form Dance (which gave birth to the co-operative team-<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">run </span><a href=""http://www.pulsebend.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">www.pulsebend.com</a><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> group)<br/></span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">•

<p>
</p><hr/><p></p><p><b>Inspirational
Background</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>The
concept of a <b>Mobile Visionary Art Temple</b> was channeled
to/through me while I was in  meditation. Through a series of
synchronistic events and manifestations, the camper trailer and a car
suitable to pull it already came to be an actuality! The idea of this
project and its birthing were entirely inspired and made manifest by
a higher purpose.</p>
<p>
</p><hr/><p></p><p><b>The
Plan</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>The
Traveling iTemple Voyager includes many facets that give those that interact with it a
variety of paths for spiritual experience.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/467028/files/20140328110836-iTemple_Voyager_Blue_Print.jpg?1396030116"" src="""" style=""width: 551.1578947368421px; height: 308px;""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>1. <font color=""#800080"">ART</font>
|</b> The main feature will be the visionary art. The art will be shared
in the following formats:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
	On 6’x6’ vinyl curtains. The trailer will be wrapped with one in
	the front, one in back, and two on the side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	There will need to be space for ropes extended off the trailer in
	all directions with more curtains hanging from it. Depending on
	finances available, an extensive network of curtains hanging from
	ropes could be emerging from the trailer tied to poles or trees,
	creating a sort of visionary art gallery/maze. Pillows will be
	placed in front of each piece of art to offer each passerby an
	opportunity to sit with and interact with the art. Small lights will
	be in front of each piece on display, for night viewing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	During evenings, one or two projectors will be mounted on the
	trailer projecting out onto a screen or sheet for an animated
	journey through my art work. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	In the vending area (see below) the art will be available for sale
	in various formats including the curtains, blankets, canvas, prints,
	and tiles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	The Trailer itself will also be decorated with LED lights and sacred
	ornaments to compliment the artwork.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ol><p><b>2.	<font color=""#0000FF"">ALTARS</font>
|</b> There is the potential for those who wish to create altars and sit
with altars that integrate and expand out from the art gallery.</p>
<p><b>3.	<font color=""#0D7BA6"">HEALING</font>
|</b> Aaron will offer “Energetic Vitalization” energy healing
sessions inside the comforts of the trailer. These will be 30 minute
or 1 hour sessions for a set fee or sliding scale. The participant
will come into the trailer where a twin bed will be setup as sacred
space for a healing journey. The session includes discussion,
meditation guidance/journey, and light touch healing work. (*There is
a possibility of other practitioners/body workers to use the space).
The interior will be decorated in sacred alignment.</p>
<p><b>4.	<font color=""#008000"">MEDITATION</font>
|</b> Aaron will offer one or two guided meditation workshop/classes near
the trailer. Participants will be surrounded by the art and be guided
through a meditation. A variety of meditation topics are available
that can be decided upon before the festival as needed for marketing
purposes.</p>
<p><b>5.	<font color=""#8D8A03"">CHILL
SPACE</font> |</b> In the evenings pillows/cushions can be setup near the
trailer and art as a small communal chill/relaxation space. Tea could
be served from the trailer. Also a small music system can be playing
relaxing/ambient music for those using the space.</p>
<p><b>6.	<font color=""#FF0000"">VENDING
– </font><i><font color=""#FF0000"">SPIRITUAL MARKETPLACE</font> </i>| </b>In 
front of the trailer (under an awning) will be a small magical marketplace that 
will a variety of items from artists, healers, and businesses Aaron has worked 
with. </p>

<p>
</p><p>Energetic
vitalization is a method of energy healing using light-touch to help
restructure and reenergize the auric field and chakra system to help
bring forth, experience, and release emotional &amp; mental patterns
that are restricting the flow of Chi or Prana (life force energy)
through one’s system. This Energetic Vitalization can help the
receiver move through energetic blocks and open one up to a more harmonious
state of being connecting more deeply with the Divinity within them.

Summary - Mobile Visionary Art TempleThe iTemple Voyager is the concept of a
traveling exhibit of spiritual and healing art from nationally recognized,
Oregon-based, artist Aaron Michael Pyne. The traveling exhibit will include a large scale outdoor Visionary Art gallery, meditation workshops, projections, chill space, and energy healing sessions. The temple will also include a marketplace of spiritual and holistic products for sale.  Each community visited by the
iTemple Voyager will be exposed to a new, deeper, spirituality through it's offerings.
The iTemple Voyager will be Aaron Pyne’s widest reaching expression yet. The goal is to take the exhibit to as many places as possible , including art, music and spirituality festivals in Washington, Oregon, and California. After our first run this summer, we intend to find avenues to take the iTemple further heading east across the country to festivals.
Breif bio of the creatorAaron
Michael Pyne

Over
the last 11 years I have worked to share my understanding of basic
spiritual truths and practices through various creative channels. I
have done web, graphic, and video design for large and small scale
spiritual and holistic businesses. I have created more than 140 visionary
pieces of art  that are encoded with spiritual symbolism to serve as
portals for the viewer to access their own inner divinity. My artwork
has been featured in shows, events, and magazines across the country.
I have taught a wide variety of meditation styles including: breath
work, chakra work, advanced energy healing techniques, spiritual dance, shamanic
journeying and other various formats to access one’s spirit guides,
angelic guides, and other multi-dimensional beings. I am trained and certified in a variety of energy healing/holistic moralities. I also avidly
promote the ability for each individual to access the infinite divine
potential within them. 


Currently
in my home town of Bend, Oregon I have started the iTemple – a
community gathering space where I have been hosting a variety of
spiritual events including:

•
Ecstatic Free Form Dance (which gave birth to the co-operative team-run www.pulsebend.com group)•
Ecstatic/Meditative Music Making Circles (participants bring whatever
instruments they have and we come together in shared music making)•
Meditation Classes•
Healing Circles•
Solstice & Equinox Ceremonies

Inspirational
Background

The
concept of a Mobile Visionary Art Temple was channeled
to/through me while I was in  meditation. Through a series of
synchronistic events and manifestations, the camper trailer and a car
suitable to pull it already came to be an actuality! The idea of this
project and its birthing were entirely inspired and made manifest by
a higher purpose.

The
Plan

The
Traveling iTemple Voyager includes many facets that give those that interact with it a
variety of paths for spiritual experience.

1. ART
| The main feature will be the visionary art. The art will be shared
in the following formats:



	On 6’x6’ vinyl curtains. The trailer will be wrapped with one in
	the front, one in back, and two on the side.



	There will need to be space for ropes extended off the trailer in
	all directions with more curtains hanging from it. Depending on
	finances available, an extensive network of curtains hanging from
	ropes could be emerging from the trailer tied to poles or trees,
	creating a sort of visionary art gallery/maze. Pillows will be
	placed in front of each piece of art to offer each passerby an
	opportunity to sit with and interact with the art. Small lights will
	be in front of each piece on display, for night viewing.



	During evenings, one or two projectors will be mounted on the
	trailer projecting out onto a screen or sheet for an animated
	journey through my art work. 
	



	In the vending area (see below) the art will be available for sale
	in various formats including the curtains, blankets, canvas, prints,
	and tiles.



	The Trailer itself will also be decorated with LED lights and sacred
	ornaments to compliment the artwork.


2.	ALTARS
| There is the potential for those who wish to create altars and sit
with altars that integrate and expand out from the art gallery.
3.	HEALING
| Aaron will offer “Energetic Vitalization” energy healing
sessions inside the comforts of the trailer. These will be 30 minute
or 1 hour sessions for a set fee or sliding scale. The participant
will come into the trailer where a twin bed will be setup as sacred
space for a healing journey. The session includes discussion,
meditation guidance/journey, and light touch healing work. (*There is
a possibility of other practitioners/body workers to use the space).
The interior will be decorated in sacred alignment.
4.	MEDITATION
| Aaron will offer one or two guided meditation workshop/classes near
the trailer. Participants will be surrounded by the art and be guided
through a meditation. A variety of meditation topics are available
that can be decided upon before the festival as needed for marketing
purposes.
5.	CHILL
SPACE | In the evenings pillows/cushions can be setup near the
trailer and art as a small communal chill/relaxation space. Tea could
be served from the trailer. Also a small music system can be playing
relaxing/ambient music for those using the space.
6.	VENDING
– SPIRITUAL MARKETPLACE | In 
front of the trailer (under an awning) will be a small magical marketplace that 
will a variety of items from artists, healers, and businesses Aaron has worked 
with. 

Potential retail items include:



	Aaron’s visionary artwork



	Locally made/organic/natural body products



	JEM Organic Nut Butters



	Meditation CDs



	Health supplements



	Hand crafted jewelry and leatherwork by Oregon artists


Oregon made healthy/organic snacks/drinks including Top Leaf Yerba Maté

A few vendors on board so far: 

Jam Raw Chocolate

Jonathan Goldman's Healing Sounds
Top Leaf Yerba Maté
Elf Mountain

about the Energetic
Vitalization Healing Sessions

Energetic
vitalization is a method of energy healing using light-touch to help
restructure and reenergize the auric field and chakra system to help
bring forth, experience, and release emotional & mental patterns
that are restricting the flow of Chi or Prana (life force energy)
through one’s system. This Energetic Vitalization can help the
receiver move through energetic blocks and open one up to a more harmonious
state of being connecting more deeply with the Divinity within them. 


Aaron
Pyne’s Energetic Vitalization is a new method built upon
over 10 years of combining various spiritual/holistic forms of energy
healing. Through extensive practice, experience, and
intuitive guidance, Aaron has developed his own method interweaving

state of well-being and wholeness, leading to an intensive presence

them forth into current energy systems while helping to clear old
emotional and mental patterns that are limiting any flow of energy

</p>
<p>   
Yoga and art share the ability to instantiate a
disembodied, self-created experience through their connection to
self-expression and healing/wellness. The practice of yoga accompanies with it
the spiritual elements of the yamas and niyamas, being ethical and very
connected to the internal state of being. In creating artwork this is also
imminent. Karen Gibbons shares the attributes that yoga and art have in common in her book ""Integrating Art and Yoga Therapy"". </p>
<p>These shared attributes include: a promotion of
self-awareness, encouragement of a flow state, activation of the limbic brain,
reduction of stress, encouragement of observation rather than judgment,
encouraging change and healing. The Eastern practice of yoga is much more than
just a physical workout or a great way to manage stress, it is deeply related
to self-expression both scientifically and philosophically. This fundamental
point shows that to practice yoga in its true form is to see it as a spiritual
to physical practice, whereas in the West it is mostly seen as a purely physical
workout. Swami Jnaneshvara writes in defense of yoga that it is a spiritual
system with a physical component and not a physical practice with a spiritual
one (<a href=""http://www.swamij.com/traditional-yoga.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.swamij.com/traditional-yoga.htm</a>).

the Brooklyn-based Yemenwed art collective that has curated an “Empatheatre” at
the Perez Art Museum Miami (PAMM) where visitors can partake in a
wellness/cultural center, coming to participate in guided meditations, see
performances, and more. </p>
<p>  I
propose an exhibition that will further explore the blurred lines between art
and wellness, in particular through the lens of both the practice of yoga and
its relation to the visual and performance arts. It is when Maurice-Merleau
Ponty says, “human reality is not body or soul, but rather that which can give
rise to either of these concepts,” that both yoga and art can be seen in the
same frame. That is, both art and yoga instantiate human reality as both body
and the “soul.” That is where the political aspects of Western appropriation of
yoga have been well rehearsed, what has been less clear is the visual
implications and their connections to the interior experiences.</p>

<p>To
that end, the exhibition will include artworks by artists such as Susanna
Harwood Rubin and Katie Cercone who explicitly incorporate yoga into their artistic practices as
well as those that bring into being the intertwining of body and mind; and yoga
practices that are not coded as art. There are also artists like Natalia Vasquez that incorporate healing and wellness to her artistic practice, while also teaching yoga. </p>
<p> In the process, the exhibition will bring
to the fore discussions of the body in art—where the practice of yoga and art
together creates a community for participants that becomes just as much a part
of the exhibition as the artworks on the walls. The intention of this
exhibition is to visualize the invisible sensations of yoga and art to study these interior states of being and self-creation.</p>

Matt Roy
The
programs I intend to include in my exhibition will explore the productive
intersections between “community” and art with and through the practice of
yoga. Grant Kester’s essay Conversation
Pieces: The Role of Dialogue in Socially- Engaged Art, lists different
versions of “new genre public art”, such as Homi K. Bhabha’s “conversational

Essentials In organizing this exhibition there will be funding needed--getting artists and/or their art work shipped, paying instructors/speakers/artists to come be a part of the exhibition in Miami, as well as a substantial, printed exhibition catalogue and materials for the yoga/art workshops. 
The breakdown of funding is as follows:
-Shipping: $1,600
-Studio Teachers/Speakers for Exhibition: $1,000
-Equipment/Materials for Exhibition: $500
-Refreshments/Sponsors: $350
- Marketing/Promoting/Printing: $300
-Online/Printed Exhibition Catalogue: $400

If my entire goal is not reached, money will be distributed as necessary and certain aspects of the exhibition may have to be cut due to budgeting. There will be a fundraising dinner in September that will be catered after a short, restorative yoga class. Pre-sale tickets for this dinner and other give-aways will be announced at:

 In uniting yoga and art, I will be combining two independent communities; a yoga studio community and an art gallery/university community (Florida International University). The yoga studio (Bala Vinyasa Yoga Miami) will benefit from self-promotion of their yoga instructors who will teach in conjunction with the exhibition for 3 workshops that tie together art and yoga within the gallery space. 
-Body as Brush: Paint and Yoga Workshop
- Glowing Light and Photo Yoga Workshop
-Intuitive Zen Painting/Yoga Workshop


Body as Brush Workshop (Paint/Yoga)


The reciprocal relationship in which the community can learn about the creativity  aspects of using the body to create art  and how it relates to yoga and the way that yogi's can connect to the performance and grace of their own practice in a more visual manner. This is tied together through the study of ""creating space"", both as a curator making art exhibitions/ literally dictating how others will interact with the gallery space, and as a yogi creating the body and mind.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

The goal set is the minmum required for this site, there is more needed, but I am in no way taking any of the load for this venture off of myself. I am asking for help, as i help myself, I am not looking for a handout. I am a firm believer in the phrase ""faith without works is dead."" My faith is an action word, and i plan on taking action to make this trip possible, i just need some help.
     If you cannot contribute, bless you just as much for even considering the thought. I am grateful for all the blessings that come my way, be it through contribution, a sharing of the page, an encouraging word, and even more so a prayer. I have always been as supportive as i possibly can be to anyone trying to achieve a positive goal or grind a dream into reality. I have faith that such support will be returned. Thank you all in advanced.",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><b>STRETCH GOAL</b>: $1,000! from Bare bones to Beautiful!<br/></p>
<p>Taking a moment to acknowledge the sheer magnitude of awesome that is my friends and fellow citizens Boston - you are amazing, and making a dream come true... to grace the streets and terrorize small children in a glittery blaze of sequinned fabric. Our initial number was the bare bones package - just enough to get the thing done as a proof of concept so we could make a better one later (and potentially one actually made of fire... but that's another story.) But why not just do it right the first time? This upgrade will allow us to go farther in weatherproofing the piece, making giant resin eyes, greasing up the moving parts with better pieces, making the handling more ergonomic, and adding a TON of detail like individual feather patterns, painted highlights, fringe pinion feathers, ruffled hackle, and whatever I can get away with on the tail. Let's take people's breathe away! Thank you so much for all your support, you make being an artist worth it.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>** <b>Update: </b> If we make $150 passed our goal to $650, I'll be casting the eyes out of transparent, emerald resin so they shine in the sun! The more we make over that, the more feathers, bells and lifelike details we can give him. Thanks everyone for your support! **<br/></p>
<p>If you had the awesomeness to have been there (and of course, we 
understand if you didn't- accidents happen), you may remember the Asylum
 Red Dragon that paraded with HONK! the year before last, delighting 
Cambervillian children and captivating adults for the glory of art and 
Artisan's Asylum.  (if you missed it, check out this short video: <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/jaypee4227/6220120329/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/jaypee4227/6220120329/</a>)</p>
<p>Well,
 the HONK! parade (<a href=""http://honkfest.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://honkfest.org/</a>) organizers reached out to Ecco 
Pierce and I and asked us to bring the Asylum's special brand of wacky 
maker spectacle back this year, and we (with help from members of the 
community), have stepped up with...</p>
<p><b><i>The Firebird Project!</i></b></p>
<p>A
 20+ foot long kinetic sculpture/puppet with two traffic lanes of 
gracefully operable wings, celebrating the creative act through 
movement, dance, and sculpture, and promoting the Cambervillian creative
 community (especially as embodied by the membership and community 
support of Artisan's Asylum).  The Firebird is scheduled to appear in 
this year's parade along with a cadre of dance and movement artists to 
delight onlooking children and inspire adults to manifest their own 
creative potential, but we need <b>your</b> help to get it there!</p>
<p>As
 you may well know, there's no money in community art, and while we 
have received some funding, we're not quite there to cover the cost of 
materials to make this happen (and we are piss-poor artists).  If you're
 a lover of art and want to help bring more of it to the public on this 
very special annual event or a supporter of our local maker community 
who wants to see it promoted, we encourage you to step up and help this 
spectacle take flight!</p>

<p class=""Body1""><span lang=""EN-US"">We believe that the ephemeral art composed on public structures deserves a venue to be displayed within the context of a traditional gallery. We hope that this exhibition will allow the viewer to take a receptive and analytical attitude toward looking at the work. The exhibit will allow people to experience public works in a more intimate physical proximity and will enable a more personal emotional response in the viewer. This work carries great weight in its visual imagery. We want to showcase the messages of these artists. It is our hope the viewer will be immersed in a room covered with provocative and active imagery and that their experience in the space will leave an impression as bold as the work upon it.</span><span lang=""EN-US""></span></p><p></p><p></p>

Goals
We believe that the ephemeral art composed on public structures deserves a venue to be displayed within the context of a traditional gallery. We hope that this exhibition will allow the viewer to take a receptive and analytical attitude toward looking at the work. The exhibit will allow people to experience public works in a more intimate physical proximity and will enable a more personal emotional response in the viewer. This work carries great weight in its visual imagery. We want to showcase the messages of these artists. It is our hope the viewer will be immersed in a room covered with provocative and active imagery and that their experience in the space will leave an impression as bold as the work upon it.


Context
Other galleries have recently had success with exhibitions of street art. The Los Angeles show, Marxist Glue, showcased 13 artists who worked directly on the walls of the gallery and had an incredible turn out with a line going down the block. Other notable events include the Tate Modern's Street Art exhibition, Paste Modernism in Sydney and Swoon's New York installation at Deitch Projects. Even the recent documentary by Banksy, Exit Through The Gift Shop details the overnight fame of artist Mr. Brainwash and culminates in a solo street art exhibition with an over capacity turn out.",0.0,0,"6 Campaigns

</div></div>","Genesis at the Crossroads, our non-profit organization, believes that the indoctrination of hatred and the violence that stems from it remains one of the most alarming pandemics of the 21st century. 
 
Our answer:   Use music to build bridges!
 
… and that is just what we have done since 1999.

 
Saffron Caravan, our signature ensemble, unites musicians from Iran, Afghanistan, Cuba, Morocco & the US. Their repertoire, spanning seven languages and multiple keys, explores Arab, Jewish and Persian musical traditions spiced with sub-Saharan roots of blues and jazz, Afro-Caribbean and South-American rhythms.  In their sacred shared musical space, we model dialogue, exchange, breaking down barriers and working together to share our common humanity, respectfully contributing individual and collective voices to Art.
(Please visit our website for their bios at www.gatc.org) 

 
This September, Saffron Caravan will perform to thousands of people in Jordanian and Israeli areas and give 500+ student-hours of music instruction to gifted children and those who have never had the privilege of holding an instrument.

 
Genesis’ humanitarian program, Arm Them with Instruments, brings gently-used instruments and professional music education to at-risk youth, helping channel passion into constructive rather than potentially destructive activities. 

 
Genesis’ digital arsenal: website, Facebook, Twitter, State Department sponsored webchats to 32 countries on 5 continents, live nationwide webstreaming of our  performances & Genesis’ and our community partners’ listserve blasts reach thousands. 

 
Leveraging INdieGoGo’s cause-marketing digital platform enables Genesis to reach thousands more  to generate critical funding and collect thousands of instrument donations to bring the gift of human expression and connection where precious lives are lost and childhood erased. 

 
                                  BECAUSE… MUSIC CONNECTS HUMANITY.
 
Our brand of “arts-diplomacy” has attracted the attention of and funding by the US Department of State and the Illinois Arts Council, corporations and foundations, however, we are unable to continue our program’s full human reach without your contribution.  
 
Without this additional aid, we simply cannot impact all of the children we want to inspire and those communities that need any and every precious model for creating bridges to transcend cultural barriers.  
 
Please take a moment to envision what your tax-deductible donation to Genesis at the Crossroads can do for our troubled world and the future student artists and leaders we are deeply committed to educate.   
 
We believe the arts profoundly reach our common core and 
link us all for the greater good of humankind.

Hello,
Thank you for taking the time to visit our page.  We are Joy
Connects, a student-led company from the Royal Central School of Speech
& Drama.  We are all currently in our 2nd year of
studying Drama, Applied Theatre and Education.  From the 19th of may to the 25th
of June we are excited to be running drama workshops in the Sam Beckman Day
Centre in Hendon, a Jewish centre which caters for adults with memory
impairment and/or a diagnosis of a type of dementia. 


Why are we doing this? 
A recent study by Russian brain surgeons suggests that two hours
 of rigorous arts activities a day may be enough to stop the progression
of dementia, due to stimulation of the area of the brain which deteriorates first.  You may agree with  us that this is a staggering
concept .  We therefore aim to use the creative arts to provide
a pleasant and enriching experience for everyone involved, even if it is somewhat momentary.
What are we aiming to do?
Our workshops will be based on the theme of travelling the world. We aim to give members a unique multi sensory
immersive experience by visually transforming the day centre's space, as well as using arts-based activities such as improvisation and puppetry.
So how can you help?
We would be grateful if you could donate to our cause and support us in
achieving our aim.
Primarily, we will need props, fabrics & craft materials. From the
pyramids of Egypt to gushing waterfalls of the Amazon, we hope to transform the
space each session and create a rich and vibrant setting. We also would like to
create ""passports"", maps, postcards and puppets (to name a few) with

greatly appreciated so that we can attempt to move away from purely verbal
interactions and create an environment which stimulates the senses, the psyche
and encourages creativity, and play - all of which have been suggested to help

Who are we?

we are two graduates of the Academy of Fine Arts in Bratislava in Slovakia, Slávka and Milan. We share together a passionate interest in drawing and so we have decided to found a magazine about contemporary drawing called X. Drawing is a phenomenon of present. We are observing an increased interest in drawing on artists today and feel the need to record and reflect it. We are trying to understand this trend and provide it with sufficient space for the presentation and discussion.
 About the magazine:

magazine of contemporary drawing called ""X"" is a platform focused on drawing medium. It provides space for the presentation of contemporary drawings and allows the theoretical reflection.
We try to:

make a map of forms of drawing in Slovak art scene and create an overview of current events. Our aim is to document and present exhibitions, authors and emerging works, workshops, competitions and other activities which belong to the contemporary discourse of drawing. We are trying to fill the existing gap in its expertise in Slovakia.
we open a scientific discussion, it is a source of important information for theoretical and artistic community. 
What is inside:

each issue focuses on a specific topic. The magazine consists of two parts. First part presents the subject in the form of essays from invited theorists. The second part presents the visual works of contemporary authors in the form of high-quality reproductions in the form of loose sheets. An important element of the magazine is an interview with the artists, providing deeper insight into the issue. A practical overview of current events and activities related to drawing in Slovakia and the surrounding area we will add at the end of the magazine.
The aim:

 is to focus the attention primarily on the Slovak art scene, while creating a constructive analogy with foreign authors to provide a picture of the current drawing in Slovakia in the context of the surrounding countries.
X:

the symbol and the name of the magazine are two crossed lines, representing one of the most basic drawings at all. This pictogram has many connotations and forms of exploitation, represents a specific point in space, the correct answer, expresses disagreement, goal, error or disagreement. That´s why we chose it for the brand of our new magazine.
 What do we need:



At the moment we have completely prepared the first issue of the magazine, which is waiting only for its printing. Through your financial contribution, we would like to pay the printing of the first two issues of the magazine X. Other issues will be hopefully funded from the sale or donations.

<h3>Residency Rescue</h3>
<p>Greetings!  My name is Catherine Armbrust—I’m fresh off the turnip truck/graduate program at the University of Missouri and getting ready to move out into the wide world.  I recently earned my Master of Fine Arts in Fibers and Sculpture and hope to find a teaching position very soon.  In the meantime, I’ve just been offered a chance for a month long artist residency in Chapala, Mexico.  The kicker is that it starts in 2 weeks! </p>
<p>This is a big chance for a fledgling artist trying to move out in the professional world and I want to take advantage of this amazing opportunity I’ve been given.  I just need a little help getting there—literally.  Because I would be traveling last minute at the height of the holiday season, ticket prices are quite high and I am having trouble coming up with the cash to make it happen.  The thought of being away from my loved ones over the holidays makes me sad, but I know that the universe is presenting me with a wonderful gift—a chance to spend a concentrated amount of time making art and preparing my body, mind, and spirit for what comes next in my life. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Rest of the Story</h3>
<p><strong>Update:  Early ticket projections were misread--THANK GOODNESS!!!  THE TICKET ACTUALLY COSTS ABOUT $1200 INSTEAD OF THE PROJECTED $2200.  BREATHING A SIGH OF RELIEF HERE TODAY...</strong></p>
<p>I am actually very afraid of flying, but want to push past my fear and focus on the wonders that await me in Mexico.  Rather than worry about the flight and the cost I want to practice “faith in action”—I understand that this is pricey, but this is an opportunity of a lifetime and I don’t want to let it get away!  That’s why I’m reaching out to you.  Though my stated goal for the campaign is $500, I would love to meet and beat that goal.  Any money you contribute to my campaign will go to cover my travel expenses to and from Guadalajara, Mexico.  <strong>Anything over the price of the plane ticket will go towards food/living expenses while I am there for the month.</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Creative Thinking</h3>
<p>I want to share my handiwork with my contributors to show you just how much this experience means to me.  I am a mixed media/assemblage artist that works with found objects, knitting/crocheting, and more.  You can see my various bodies of work at <a href=""http://www.catherinearmbrust.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.catherinearmbrust.com</a>.  I have a project in mind to work on while I am in Mexico—a series of collages dealing with masking and personal ornamentation (a continuation of a recent project), plus some possible site-specific installations.  But I also want to create a series of small collages to share with you folks who’ve helped make this a reality!  Different levels of donations will receive one-of-a-kind collages made while I am in Mexico (to be mailed when I arrive back in the U.S.).</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Gratitude</h3>
<p>I studied abroad in Mexico while at the University of Missouri in the early 90’s.  I feel like this chance to return would almost be like I’m coming full circle after attending MU again to get my Master of Fine Arts.  I feel so blessed to have this chance to make art while immersed in an amazing culture and blessed that you have taken the time to read this.  This is the first time I’ve asked the public for anything like this before—please know how much your contribution would mean to me and to my creative spirit.  I know times are tough for folks right now; even if you can’t contribute, I’d appreciate you sharing my project with others who might be interested.</p>

<p><strong>We were somewhere outside of Barstow, on the edge of the desert, when the art began to take hold.</strong></p>
<p>The creative expanse of an artist's mind is boundless, limitless, a primed surface tense with potential. This is an experiment, a journey to reconfigure a physical world created by the necessities of a society that saw fit to draw clearly defined borders in the sacred realm of artistic expression. This is an exercise in finding the strength to break down those borders. This is an opportunity to take the shortest distance between two points into the realm of the non-linear.</p>
<p><strong>THIS IS US VERSUS BORDER LINES</strong></p>
<p><strong>This Is Us Versus Border Lines </strong>is an epic 10 day creative cross-country art excursion accompanied by video and blog documentation that includes fine art, tagging and graffiti, wheatpasting, and 3D projection mapping of urban spaces that will culminate in a guerilla-style gallery exhibition projected onto the side of buildings throughout the destination ­displaying the individual and collaborative work of two artists with drastically different approaches to the creative process. Their work on this journey, while heavily informed by the limitations that exist within their own lives, will focus on a transference of the physical spaces they explore into a new world and the creation of a personal truth devoid of border lines.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>This Is Us Versus Borderlines will take us from Atlanta</span> to Los Angeles in 10 Days.</li>
<li>The journey will be filmed, photographed, blogged, and streamed live daily, ultimately leading to the production of a full-length documentary. </li>
<li>Along the way, we will create individual and collaborative fine art, street art, and project video and still imagery onto urban spaces and natural structures. </li>
<li>We will invite feedback and contribution from passers by as well as arrange collaborations with local artists along the way. </li>
<li>The final exposition of work created over the course of this project will be a web-broadcasted impromptu ""projection bombing"" of buildings along Gallery Row during an LA Art Walk, where up to 70,000 people will be engaged in the results of this project. </li>
<li>The successful funding of this project will be used to help launch This Is Us Versus into overdrive. Immediately following the completion of Border Lines, we will begin organizing our next project.</li>
<li>We need help surpassing this funding goal and spreading the word about this project through any media outlet or social networking utility. </li>
</ul><p><strong>WHO IS THIS IS US VERSUS?</strong></p>
<p><strong>This Is Us Versus</strong> is a burgeoning bicoastal art collective that focuses on providing resources, networking, and exhibition opportunities for talented emerging artists that struggle to secure them in their communities due to the subject matter or execution of their work. From street art to controversial art and contemporary surrealism, from Guerilla projection bombing of urban spaces to animated films, it is the mission of This Is Us Versus to ensure that nothing worth seeing is ever overlooked.</p>

<p><strong>By contributing to this project</strong>, you are contributing to every future endeavor of <strong>This Is Us Versus</strong>. While this particular project is the culmination of several years of hard work building the connections and support to begin larger projects, <strong>This Is Us Versus Border Lines </strong>is just the beginning. <strong>Every gifted artist deserves the exhibition opportunities that This Is Us Versus will provide. </strong> In 2011, <strong>TIUV </strong>organized the most highly attended underground art exhibition in Atlanta by an order of magnitude, showcasing the work of over two dozen artists and giving several of them the first sale they had ever made. We only hope to grow from there. Whether it's organizing a national surrealist art exhibition to accompany the work of Alex Grey in Atlanta this fall, or bombing the streets of Los Angeles with building-sized projections of fine art from emerging artists, <strong>every great achievement begins with a journey. This is ours. </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>This Is Us Versus</strong> <strong>Border Lines has a funding goal of at least $3500. </strong>That said, every contribution, no matter how small or how large, even if it is not monetary, is absolutely invaluable to us and every artist that we have or will affiliate with.</li>
<li>
<strong>Monetary contributions will help us along our journey to fund art supplies, video equipment, travel expenses like gas and lodging, and maybe something to put in our starving artist tummies. </strong>We are also accepting lodging donations and would love to share our encounters with other artists and art enthusiasts along the way. So check the route and see if we'll be stomping through your town.</li>
<li>
<strong>What's in it for you? This Is Us Versus will offer rewards for contributions! </strong>Rewards include desktop backgrounds, the best hugs ever, signed and numbered fine art prints, a DVD of the <strong>This Is Us Versus Border Lines </strong>documentary, limited edition T-shirts, all of the original artwork created along the way, and several larger collaborative studio paintings inspired by the journey.</li>
<li>
<strong>Follow Along At Home</strong>! The route will be posted online for all to see (and likely deviated from heavily as we explore the limitless scope of this creative endeavor),  as well as a daily blog for all to follow us as we make our way across the country, <strong>This Is Us Versus</strong> Style!</li>
<li>
<strong>The most effective way to contribute to this project is to share it with the world, just as This Is Us Versus Borders will be shared. </strong>The culmination of this project is a guerilla style projection bombing gallery exhibition broadcast online showcasing the work created over the course of this journey and excerpts from the footage taken along the way.

We were somewhere outside of Barstow, on the edge of the desert, when the art began to take hold.
The creative expanse of an artist's mind is boundless, limitless, a primed surface tense with potential. This is an experiment, a journey to reconfigure a physical world created by the necessities of a society that saw fit to draw clearly defined borders in the sacred realm of artistic expression. This is an exercise in finding the strength to break down those borders. This is an opportunity to take the shortest distance between two points into the realm of the non-linear.
THIS IS US VERSUS BORDER LINES
This Is Us Versus Border Lines is an epic 10 day creative cross-country art excursion accompanied by video and blog documentation that includes fine art, tagging and graffiti, wheatpasting, and 3D projection mapping of urban spaces that will culminate in a guerilla-style gallery exhibition projected onto the side of buildings throughout the destination ­displaying the individual and collaborative work of two artists with drastically different approaches to the creative process. Their work on this journey, while heavily informed by the limitations that exist within their own lives, will focus on a transference of the physical spaces they explore into a new world and the creation of a personal truth devoid of border lines.


This Is Us Versus Borderlines will take us from Atlanta to Los Angeles in 10 Days.
The journey will be filmed, photographed, blogged, and streamed live daily, ultimately leading to the production of a full-length documentary. 
Along the way, we will create individual and collaborative fine art, street art, and project video and still imagery onto urban spaces and natural structures. 
We will invite feedback and contribution from passers by as well as arrange collaborations with local artists along the way. 
The final exposition of work created over the course of this project will be a web-broadcasted impromptu ""projection bombing"" of buildings along Gallery Row during an LA Art Walk, where up to 70,000 people will be engaged in the results of this project. 
The successful funding of this project will be used to help launch This Is Us Versus into overdrive. Immediately following the completion of Border Lines, we will begin organizing our next project.
We need help surpassing this funding goal and spreading the word about this project through any media outlet or social networking utility. 
WHO IS THIS IS US VERSUS?
This Is Us Versus is a burgeoning bicoastal art collective that focuses on providing resources, networking, and exhibition opportunities for talented emerging artists that struggle to secure them in their communities due to the subject matter or execution of their work. From street art to controversial art and contemporary surrealism, from Guerilla projection bombing of urban spaces to animated films, it is the mission of This Is Us Versus to ensure that nothing worth seeing is ever overlooked.

<p><span>All around us, people are in need. Personal tragedies occur on a daily basis, and touch our lives through family, friends, co- workers, neighbors, etc. A great many of us find ourselves unprepared when these life changing events occur, and all to often need to seek assistance. Many times this assistance is sought by way of benefit events, auctions and sales. There exists a need for quality items to draw interest and money to these fundraising events, and that is where The Awiya Project wants to help. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>The Awiya Project is currently utilizing a crowd funding campaign to raise the money needed to create quality fine art to be donated to these benefit events. And while these charitable donations are the general focus of The Awiya Project, we also are available for donations to public venues to provide public art.

<h2><strong>The Awiya Project - Art that Gives </strong></h2>
<p>Simply put The Awiya Project is about giving, about helping others, about building a better world through art.</p>
<p>My wife, Lou, and I have been artists, well, all our lives.  Her career began at Minneapolis College of Art and Design, and mine began as a child, as far back as I can remember.  We are working artists, living in rural Nebraska.  Helping others has been a major part of our lives as well.  Lou &amp; I work for a nonprofit organization as   Community Support Professionasl as our day jobs, her career spanning 20 years and I began participating in fundraising efforts as a child, raising money for Jerry's kid with my uncle every year, who suffered from Duchene Muscular Dystrophy.  Helping others is just a part of who we are.</p>
<p>With increasing frequency, we are asked to donate one of our pieces for various fundraising efforts.  And while we have yet to turn anyone away, it becomes more difficult to keep purchasing art materials when we are giving the paintings away.  I made a casual comment on my facebook page oneday, about how I wish there was crowdfunding for artists.  I was entirely unaware this amazing venue, Indiegogo, even existed.  Thanks to a tip from a friend, an idea was born.</p>
<p>We want to GIVE every single piece we create for six months away!  All of them.  With one small catch - we want to give them to fundraising auctions, charity sales, public libraries and other public venues, etc.  We want our art to help people.  To provide aid to those that need it, give inspiration to those who might not otherwise have it, to do good in the world.  Art that gives, that really truly gives.  That is what we want to do... with your help.</p>
<h2>So, how can you help?</h2>
<p>Art is, well, expensive.  Quality materials, which produce beautiful works that last for literally generations, cost more than most people think.  A tube of decent paint that can be used for thick applications is about $18.99 plus tax, for a tube that fits in the palm of your hand.  But a higher pigment load (more color saturation) used in thinner applications, well a tiny tube of that stuff can cost upwards of $30, and believe me they are small tubes, about the size of your thumb.  And then there are rolls of canvas, boards, stretcher bars, gesso and such that go into just making the surface that gets painted.  Brushes, mixing mediums, drying mediums, varnish and all manner of products that go into the painting itself besides just paint.  Two new travel easels will be needed so we can work en plein air as much as possible, so that we may interact with the public and get the word out.  And we like to frame as many pieces as possible, especially in this case, so that the fundraising effort receives a final product, rather than one that would include additional investment.  And of course, shipping materials and expenses.  All of these things are the reason why you always hear the phrase 'starving artist.'  It is insanely expensive.</p>
<p>So we are asking for your help in funding a portion of these costs, (we also will have to use close to 10%, or more depending on final amount, of the funds raised here as fees and costs of using Indiegogo and payment processors), so that for six months, two artists can give every single piece they create away, in a manner that helps other people, so that the cycle of giving continues.  Pay it forward, as it were.</p>
<h2>Other little ways The Awiya Project helps -</h2>
<p>In addition to creating the art that then gets donated to fundraising efforts, we also make our art purchases in mindful ways as often as possible.  If we can purchase materials through a place that offers a percentage of the sale to a worthy cause, we do.  If we  can find a vendor that then, in turn, supports community art projects, then we purchase through them.  Even the rags we use to clean our brushes, we purchase at a local thrift shop that takes donationed items, and uses all the proceeds to aid local senior citizens.  Lou and I make every attempt to be an active part in the community of giving as often as we can.  Changing the world occurs through one act of kindness at a time.</p>
<h2>Want to help, but don't have the cash?</h2>
<p>You can still help, and we still need it!  Tell people about us!  Get the word out.  Like our Facebook fan page, visit our website (often), follow us on twitter (and use the hashtag #AwiyaProject), tell people about our blogs and our pages.  Help us reach out to as many people as we can, so we can all reach as many lives as possible, and change the world one piece of art at a time.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our target goal, we will use the funds we do receive to extend The Awiya Project as long as we can.  In other words, if we only reach half the funding goal, that probably puts us at about half the time. But we have timed the creation of the Project to take us through the end of 2012.  We hope to spend the entirety of the remaining year dedicated to helping as many people as possible.  And while we will not be creating any works to sell during The Awiya Project, any proceeds from print sales from these paintings will be put right back into The Awiya Project.  We want the cycle of giving to last as long as it possibly can.  We hope to never <em>sell </em>another painting ever again!</p>

All around us, people are in need. Personal tragedies occur on a daily basis, and touch our lives through family, friends, co- workers, neighbors, etc. A great many of us find ourselves unprepared when these life changing events occur, and all to often need to seek assistance. Many times this assistance is sought by way of benefit events, auctions and sales. There exists a need for quality items to draw interest and money to these fundraising events, and that is where The Awiya Project wants to help. 
 
The Awiya Project is currently utilizing a crowd funding campaign to raise the money needed to create quality fine art to be donated to these benefit events. And while these charitable donations are the general focus of The Awiya Project, we also are available for donations to public venues to provide public art. Small community public libraries, schools, and public meeting spaces are all places deserving of public art to inspire the creative spark in all people. The artists of The Awiya project provide their time and talent, while the funds of the crowd funding campaign provide the materials, so that a high quality, finished work of art can be available to people, groups and organizations in need. We hope to inspire not only those that view the work, but other artist as well, to engage the giving spirit and answer the call for help in our communities.

<h3><b>Company Overview:</b></h3>
<p>In
 the winter of 2008, outdoor adventure guide Cassandra Styles took on a 
different kind of challenge. The local ""sheltered workshop"" (old 
term) for adults with developmental disabilities was in need of an 
overhaul, and members of the community thought she was just the woman
 to do it. Styles, a mixed-media artist and accomplished
 entrepreneur, re-invented the business as a “day program”
 (new term) that nurtured creativity, growth, respect, and community 
inclusion. The participants named the program Shortbus Studio because 
after a lifetime of riding small yellow buses, they wanted to make it 
cool. Under 
Styles’ direction, the program has become a nationally celebrated model 
for facilitated learning through a variety of art, volunteer, 
educational, and outdoor adventure activities.</p>
<h3>Mission:</h3>
<p>The mission of Shortbus Studio is to help bridge barriers between people
 and communities, and to teach us that in the end, we are more alike 
than we are different.        </p>
<h3></h3>
<p></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Funding Needs:</h3>
<p>Shortbus Studio participants need a new wheelchair accessible bus. Specifically, a bus with a 12 passenger capacity and room for two wheelchairs plus a driver. Upgrading to aluminum wheels would lower maintenance costs and reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas 
emissions. Installing a backup 
camera would allow the driver to see in places that 
mirrors cannot. Adding cargo nets would help keep riders safe by 
preventing outdoor gear, art equipment, or any other items from coming 
loose in the rear of the bus. Also, foldaway seats would make each trip easier by providing multiple wheelchair/seating arrangements and allow more room for locking 
in wheelchairs. Safety is the biggest priority for Shortbus Studio, but the vehicles in use now are not safe due to years of wear and tear, high mileage, multiple breakdowns and unreliable wheelchair lifts. A new wheelchair accessible bus costs $65,000. With your help Shortbus Studio can continue to be an inspiration
and model for other organizations. They can continue <span>exploring ways to use
adventures, volunteering and the arts to build collaborations and everyday
relationships with members of the community. With your help they can continue to educate the public on how
individuals with disabilities are much more alike than different from them.</span></p>
<p><span>Shortbus Studio participants are convinced that they can raise the $65,000 needed to purchase a new bus; however, if they don't reach their entire goal, all funds will go towards </span>vehicle maintenance, program activities, art supplies and much needed studio repairs.   <br/></p>
<h3> Why Shortbus Studio Is Important:</h3>
<p></p>

In
 the winter of 2008, outdoor adventure guide Cassandra Styles took on a 
different kind of challenge. The local ""sheltered workshop"" (old 
term) for adults with developmental disabilities was in need of an 
overhaul, and members of the community thought she was just the woman
 to do it. Styles, a mixed-media artist and accomplished
 entrepreneur, re-invented the business as a “day program”
 (new term) that nurtured creativity, growth, respect, and community 
inclusion. The participants named the program Shortbus Studio because 
after a lifetime of riding small yellow buses, they wanted to make it 
cool. Under 
Styles’ direction, the program has become a nationally celebrated model 
for facilitated learning through a variety of art, volunteer, 
educational, and outdoor adventure activities.
Mission:
The mission of Shortbus Studio is to help bridge barriers between people
 and communities, and to teach us that in the end, we are more alike 
than we are different.        


  Funding Needs:
Shortbus Studio participants need a new wheelchair accessible bus. Specifically, a bus with a 12 passenger capacity and room for two wheelchairs plus a driver. Upgrading to aluminum wheels would lower maintenance costs and reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas 
emissions. Installing a backup 
camera would allow the driver to see in places that 
mirrors cannot. Adding cargo nets would help keep riders safe by 
preventing outdoor gear, art equipment, or any other items from coming 
loose in the rear of the bus. Also, foldaway seats would make each trip easier by providing multiple wheelchair/seating arrangements and allow more room for locking 
in wheelchairs. Safety is the biggest priority for Shortbus Studio, but the vehicles in use now are not safe due to years of wear and tear, high mileage, multiple breakdowns and unreliable wheelchair lifts. A new wheelchair accessible bus costs $65,000. With your help Shortbus Studio can continue to be an inspiration
and model for other organizations. They can continue exploring ways to use
adventures, volunteering and the arts to build collaborations and everyday
relationships with members of the community. With your help they can continue to educate the public on how
individuals with disabilities are much more alike than different from them.
Shortbus Studio participants are convinced that they can raise the $65,000 needed to purchase a new bus; however, if they don't reach their entire goal, all funds will go towards vehicle maintenance, program activities, art supplies and much needed studio repairs.   
 Why Shortbus Studio Is Important:

As a longtime advocate for people with disabilities, Cassandra Styles thought nothing could sound 
less cool to her than a program where people with 
disabilities are segregated and confined in one space all day, sitting 
at tables doing repetitive piece work for which they are paid very 
little. She believed that isolating, boring ""sheltered workshops"" could be transformed into inclusive spaces where the arts, community engagement, and 
adventure are primary elements. She hoped that Shortbus Studio would become an inspiration and model for other programs serving adults with special needs, and provide participants opportunities to help others in their community instead of always being the ones perceived as needing help.

Photography is rooted in capturing moments and documenting a present that is tomorrow's past, so it's only natural that the photographer has a streak of nostalgia. In my journey to becoming a better photographer, my affinity for history created a curiosity about the progression of equipment and techniques that got us to where we are today. </p>
<p>Photography has been one of my passions since I was very young, and in recent years I have focused a great deal of attention on developing the craft. I have always been a photographer on a budget, so I have always looked for ways to innovate within my means. In my research about the progression of cameras, I stumbled across an article that highlighted the advantages of going with film even in today's digital world.  This set my mind in motion.  This was the kind of challenge that appealed to me.  </p>
<p>Working with a vintage Yashica A Medium Format Twin Lens Reflex camera, is a test of skill.  Every time you shoot with film you have to make it count. You have to become better at composing to get good images.  It forces you to slow down and look at the scene and decide what angle you like, instead of shooting from every possible angle and sorting it out later. </p>

</h3>
<p>Part 2: After the camera is fighting fit, I plan to do a series of shoots to test the camera's limitations and to build experience with the Yashica A. Shooting will be centered around the theme: a day in the life of Des Moines County, Iowa. The range of shots will cover Landscapes/Cityscapes/Landmarks , Architecture, &amp; Still Life. I will be shooting with black and white film, and infrared film.  This will help in the development of a class that will focus specifically on film photography, that will be available through the Art Center of Burlington. Your contribution will cover a portion of the cost of purchasing and processing film.</p>
<p>Part 3:   The final objective of this project is to produce a gallery exhibit featuring the best images from the project. This portion will help create enthusiasm for film photography, for the class, and will generate revenue for the Art Center of Burlington as 30% of the proceeds from prints from this project and from sales of prints during the showing will go to the Art Center of Burlington.  The contribution to the Art Center will help provide funds for community art projects &amp; programs, as well as promotion of local artists.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>By supporting this project your are ensuring the continuation of the knowledge base about shooting with vintage cameras. You are preserving a part of our history and a tool of expressing our humanity. You are fueling a movement that has already began to bubble to the surface. For example, just this year I saw where Popular Photography used double exposure for their theme for one of their monthly photo contests. Double exposure is from the era of cameras like the Yashica A, before double exposure protection was incorporated into the camera design. Before this design change it was possible to forget to wind the film before taking the next shot exposing an already exposed frame in which the two different scenes are superimposed. Now cameras and software are incorporating these effects as a means of furthering creativity. Without your support we can not produce the gallery exhibit, which is the heart and soul of this project. This is our greatest tool for promoting awareness of the value of vintage cameras (of all types) and of the past developments that have shaped our viewpoints of the art form of photography.</p>

<h3>My Challenge </h3>
<p>Typically, the University of Alaska, Anchorage provides students the opportunity to apply for an Undergraduate Research Grant. Due to university-wide budget cuts, grant funding has been cut by 50%. This means I can only apply to receive $1,000 of the $3,200 needed to complete my thesis.  </p>
<p>I've been working towards this moment for the last five years so I want to document my work and also ensure it's available to experience in person. </p>
<h3>My Experience </h3>
<p>Since 2015, my work has been featured in numerous group shows in addition to a solo gallery show in June 2019. Locations include the International Gallery of Contemporary Art, Akela Space, and the Hugh McPeck Gallery along with various showcases at local businesses. Four works were accepted into juried art shows with three awarded honorable mentions. </p>
<h3>My Work</h3>
<p>My work is influenced by Minimalism and Non-objectivity. Emphasis is placed on order, simplicity, materiality, and placement. I've been experimenting with optical illusions to alter the viewer’s sense of perspective. Materials like steel rod and string don't take up very much space volumetrically but have the potential to take up a large amount of space visually. </p>
<p>The goal is to create artwork that envelops the viewer and invites them to move around the space that I’ve constructed.  Playing with the viewer's sense of spatial awareness forces them to focus only on what is in front of them, thus creating a truly in-the-moment-experience.</p>

(concept art below) We have lots of fantastic perks that come along with contributing to the campaign, everything from t-shirts and patches with the temple logo:to one on one tight-wire lessons with our professional team!With your help, we will have the infrastructure to bring the Temple of Tension all over the world.  Every little bit helps, even if you can only donate a dollar, you would be contributing to large-scale interactive art that will last for decades. If you aren't able to contribute $$$, consider sharing our campaign on Facebook and other social media platforms for greater visibility.",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>A long and diverse career as a scenic artist, props and modelmaker in television and theatre has given Tim a background which has resulted in these wonderful images.</p>
<p>Tim has many ‘fans’ already of his work; those who he has worked with during the years, in the artistic and theatre communities, plus more recently,  members of modelling and aviation-related internet forums abounding around the world. Really just anyone else who happens to see something he has created.</p>
<p>After many years of producing some unique work, particularly like those offered here, we are, finally,  aiming to produce a full colour calendar of his breathtaking ‘Model Aircraft in Flight’ – the first of an eventual series. <em>(And there are definitely enough photos for it!) </em></p>
<h3><em>A collection of stunning full colour photographs of Model Aircraft in Flight, by talented artist Tim Prosser, offered as a 12 month bound calendar. </em></h3>
<p>This campaign will also see the set-up achieved for several other items offered, both here and later on. The Calendar, obviously, but also a collection of posters, postcard sets, some limited editions, plus various commission works for Tim to create in the future.</p>
<p>Tim has a large amount of work not yet seen and with that we wish to endeavour to create a series of collections that will showcase his amazing art.</p>
<h3><em>This collection of images of model aircraft in flight, finely detailed, many originally photographed on 35mm film, are just as incredible as their creation. </em></h3>
<p>These are extensively re-worked models, incorporating scatch-built details and realistic paint finishing, then photographed on glass over original hand painted backdrops. They are all ‘one of a kind’ – and bring wonderful realism to the images created.</p>
<p><em><strong> “ You do think these are ‘real’... real aircraft, in the air! Amazing! ”</strong></em></p>
<p>There's no Photoshop here...just good old-fashioned inventive talent.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></h3>
<p>For this project to succeed, we need help to pay for the printing of the calendars, 'up front', as it were, which is why we need YOUR help with pre-orders!</p>
<p>Please take advantage of the ‘perks’ we’ve offered and know we are grateful for all your assistance in making a dream come true, by contributing in any way you can to this campaign.</p>
<p><em><strong>And please ‘spread the word’ to others who might be interested.</strong></em></p>
<p>All investments, from small to large, will be very gratefully received with our thanks, for helping make a wonderful idea actually happen.</p>
<p>There are quite a few different contributions for this calendar and the print run of ephemera.</p>
<p><em><strong>From only $15 upwards … for a full color, high resolution digital-only version of the calendar to $50 dollars where you receive one signed copy of the calendar shipped to your address AND a copy of the digital version to tide you over while your real copy arrives!</strong></em></p>
<p>Also many other very special and unique commissions. Please see below for further details on these and feel free to contact one of the team to discuss any questions you may have on timprosserart@gmail.com</p>
<p><em><strong>Particularly collectible for the Aircraft Enthusiast!</strong></em></p>
<p>Also included are limited edition prints and posters. Hopefully something that will appeal to most.</p>
<p>The funds raised with this campaign will allow us to print the calendars, (quality printers aren’t cheap) the posters, postcards, and art materials for future art projects.</p>
<p><em><strong>In addition to some very special ‘perks’ there is also a very special ‘Milestone’ Prize!</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>When we reach our $5,000 initial goal, we will award a prize, drawn randomly from all the contributors,  to win their choice of five Limited Edition Prints images from the current range available – these will be signed and numbered by Tim. Plus a set of the 12 sepia Limited Edition postcards.</strong></em></p>
<h3>We also ask …</h3>
<p>That you take into account, the calendar and all other images, photos and artwork took Tim hours upon hours and weeks and weeks of work in total to do. He pours every ounce of his talent into the images he creates.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, that being said, once you get the digital copies of the pictures - <strong>PLEASE do NOT redistribute the pictures anywhere online, or upload them anywhere!</strong> You can, of course, show them to your friends, but if they like them as well, ask them to consider donating so that they can get copies of their own. And if one person gets the calendar only to spread the pictures or scan them then spread them around, we would have spent the money to make this happen for nothing! WE WILL EVENTUALLY upload the pictures to the internet in a MUCH smaller file format without the calendar information, and probably crop them, but you will be receiving, first hand, the artwork in full resolution.</p>
<p><br/>So we thank you all in advance for reading this and following the rules.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If this all goes smoothly, we will be excited to continue with the SECOND version of the calendar very soon! Which will be a 16 month version of NEW images !!!<br/><br/>Also just so everyone knows... The digital calendars will ONLY BE sent out once the campaign is over.</p>
<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Special Commissions</span></h3>
<p><em>These commissions are only available in very limited numbers – Tim can only paint ‘so fast’! </em></p>
<p><em>So they are a very unique opportunity to own something very special.</em></p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Ben Clarkson and I am an artist and an illustrator from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, North America, The world, etc.... I am starting an art subscription service where in exchange for 45 bones (USD) you get a limited edition print of one of my drawings, paintings, or collages, once a month, for a year. That's 12 pieces of art for less than 5 bucks each, and you get a signed print, and something in the mail that's not a bill. </p>
<p>The prints will be from limited one time editions of around 50. Eventually they'll also be archival as I figure out what I am doing. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If I don't get a bunch of people on board for this I will starve. Art is difficult and time consuming, and I need the subscriptions to be able to afford my very humble lifestyle. </p>

<h3>Hello, we are Kris and Sabrina</h3>
<p>     We have woken up today in this time of economic woe, to find out a credit card company has drained our bank account of all funds by possible fraud or clerical error. While we are hoping to get this sorted out it will still leave us penniless for the time being. Anyone who has ever had to deal with banks and missing funds will know how long it can take to actually get your money back into your account.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
     In order to make our bills and rent for the month, we are hoping to raise $1000 dollars in a short period of time. We can bounce back from this unfortunate turn of events but could really use a kind hand in helping us to do that.</div>
<div>     Kris is a talented up-and-coming painter/illustrator working on both fine art and cartoons and Sabrina is a wonderful craftsperson who regularly sells her handmade wares on Etsy.</div>
<div>     We are more than happy to offer great gifts to contributors ranging from handmade cards, handmade coffee cozee's, all the way up to commissioned paintings.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>   **update- we are very flexible with perks, you ave something in mind? We will make it happen!</div>

<div> </div></div>","Hello, we are Kris and Sabrina
     We have woken up today in this time of economic woe, to find out a credit card company has drained our bank account of all funds by possible fraud or clerical error. While we are hoping to get this sorted out it will still leave us penniless for the time being. Anyone who has ever had to deal with banks and missing funds will know how long it can take to actually get your money back into your account.
  **update- it does to appear to be a clerical error related to our online bill pay. Hopefully we will find out more today.


What We Need & What You Get
     In order to make our bills and rent for the month, we are hoping to raise $1000 dollars in a short period of time. We can bounce back from this unfortunate turn of events but could really use a kind hand in helping us to do that.
     Kris is a talented up-and-coming painter/illustrator working on both fine art and cartoons and Sabrina is a wonderful craftsperson who regularly sells her handmade wares on Etsy.
     We are more than happy to offer great gifts to contributors ranging from handmade cards, handmade coffee cozee's, all the way up to commissioned paintings.
 
   **update- we are very flexible with perks, you ave something in mind? We will make it happen!
 
     Thanks for all the love, support and understanding from everyone it has been very uplifting.

<p>Bent-Con is the world's largest LGBTQ geek event, a mixing ground for fans, creators, industry and allies of the science fiction, fantasy and horror genres, as seen in comics, movies, games, literature and technology, to meet and celebrate their  love of the unfettered realms of imagination. We bring together artists, writers, creators, publishers, directors, actors, producers and celebrities with fans, fan groups, collectors and the merely curious.</p>
<p>We joke that we're like Comic-Con, only gayer, but when you look at the collection of humans and aliens and interdimensional beings that join together on our floor, we really are.</p>
<h2>What We're Doing </h2>
<p>This is the third year of the convention. We launched in 2010, here in Los Angeles, California, more as a whim than anything else. We had 20 vendors crammed into an old storefront and everyone brought books to read, thinking no one would show. 500 people flowed through over the course of an afternoon, hungry for genre media that spoke to them -- or where they could geek out on mainstream movies, books and games in a queer way.</p>
<p>Last year, we exploded in size. We held a larger event, over a weekend, at a downtown Los Angeles hotel.  2000 people beat down the door to see our guests, listen to our panels, view films, dance in our costume contest and celebrate with other members of the community. The founders and crew were gobsmacked. Everyone cried more! More!</p>
<p>This year, after listening to fans, vendors and guests, we're now two and half days long, in a bigger venue still -- the Burbank Marriott and Convention Center -- with the best lineup of guests we've ever put together. Authors <a href=""http://bent-con.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Christopher Rice and David Gerrold, actress Claudia Christian, creator Jane Espenson, artist Phil Jimenez, and the legend Wendy Pini</a> are just some of those attending. We have so many more you have to go to our website to see the ever growing Assembly of Awesomeness scheduled to attend.</p>
<p>But with all of this has come growing pains. Lots and lots of growing pains.</p>
<h2>Why We Need Your Help </h2>
<p>We're a non-profit, a 501c3 foundation -- hey, it's why your donation is tax deductible -- so we aren't in it for the money. Celebrating, showcasing, appreciating and networking are what the convention is about.</p>
<p>But that also means that we do this by the skin of our teeth, with much fretting, no frills and lots of niceities left out for lack of funds. The dedication of our team and volunteers make up most of the slack, but not all of it.</p>
<p>We cut corners wherever we can, do without many things common to other, larger, for profit conventions, and continually remain panicked that our memberships won't cover all the bills.</p>
<p>We'd love for that to change.</p>
<h2>What We Want</h2>
<p>This year we're looking for helping to pay a host of expenses, big and small, before the con starts and to add back in the box-full of corners we've had to cut out.</p>
<p>Your donations will help us do things like create step-and-repeats, red carpets, internet-wifi, professional grade video recording of panels, internet streaming of panels, scholarships, larger and more numerous meeting spaces, guest services, t-shirts for our volunteers and if we’re lucky for every attendee at the festival, access and opportunity for guests in other countries to attend, advertising -- real blessed advertising. -- signs, individual convention guides,  oh, and the event-space rental bill paid off before the con starts.</p>
<p>The Powers That Be with this convention are a determined and dedicated assortment of misfits, characters and broken toys. We're all a bit crazy to put this thing together; with your help, awareness and donations, our crazy will go much further than it has ever gone before.</p>
<p>Yes, that's a Star Trek reference. We're geeks.</p>

<p><strong>Bent-Con FAQ:</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Who makes Bent-Con happen?</em></strong><br/>Bent-Con is a concerted effort by individuals who are themselves a part of the communities they seek to celebrate with the festival. Artists, Writers, Film-makers, Fans and the sort.</p>
<p><strong><em>Given your established history, why go this route with Indiegogo?</em></strong><br/>Because we’re committed to having more for the community that nurtures and supports the ideals and mission with this festival. We want to raise the bar on what’s expected, create more variety and challenge ourselves to see if we can continue to both grow and expand Bent-Con’s presence.</p>
<p><strong><em>Why are you called,”Bent-Con?” Why not something else?</em></strong><br/>Being “Bent” isn’t straight, being Bent is also different and typically perceived as broken, damaged or not “right.” We wanted to say and celebrate that being different is perfectly okay, acceptable and welcome in this instance. We celebrate Difference.</p>
<p><strong><em>Is the convention just about comic books?</em></strong><br/>No! It's about all things media. Comics are where we started, but we've quickly grown to include movies, books, TV, games... even a bit of technology, because our crowd loves the gadgets.</p>
<p><strong><em>I thought there was a gay convention for video games?</em></strong><br/>There is! Gaymer Con is getting off the ground in 2013. (We're even showcasing them at our event.) While video and table-top games aren't our main focus as you can't geek out without gaming, too.</p>
<p><strong><em>I’m not LGBT, can I come?</em></strong><br/>Absolutely! It’s in our mission statement: LGBT AND LGBT-friendly. Anyone who includes us or simply want to make it known they support, appreciate and celebrate with us are welcome. Even some of our exhibitors and guests are non-LGBT identified. Bent-Con is an educational foundation and we strive to share and include anyone and everyone who shares the same vision.</p>
<p><strong><em>Why are you segregating yourselves? Isn’t that part of the problem?</em></strong><br/>Not at all. Bent-Con is committed to sharing and celebrating the contributions of those that are often times overlooked in a mainstream setting. And Bent-Con is simply acknowledging those contributions and celebrating our presence out loud.</p>
<p><strong><em>Who are the gaylebrities available for lunch? </em></strong></p>
<p>They include: Justin Hall, Jon Macy, Zan Christensen, Mark Andreyko, Joe Phillips, Phil Jimenez, Patrick Fillion, Dave Davenport, Sean Z., Jeff Krell, Brian Anderson, David Gerrold. More are being added.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, My name is Jennifer. Im from Australia and my beautiful boyfriend Nantachai, who is from Thailand, is an amazing and truely gifted fire twirler and acrobat!</p>
<p>Born on a dirt floor in the remote town of Khon Kaen, Thailand, his family couldnt afford to send him to highschool. Instead he moved to Bangkok and started building bungalows at age 13. Then, at age 17, after spending a few years on a fishing boat he ended up swimming to shore at the beautiful island of Koh Tao. Here he started to learn how to spin fire for the passing tourists. Its 10 years later and he is one of the islands finest fire spinners, having taught himself to do back layouts using only the ocean. He is now  known throughout koh Tao, Koh Phangan and Koh Samui for his skills but sadly he is only ever able to work for tip money.</p>
<p>I myself am a circus performer and am studying at the Beijing International Acrobatics school which holds some of the worlds best teachers and, this year, I made an appliaction for him to attend. If we can raise the money for him to go, I believe this opportunity could change his life and the life to his family.</p>
</div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The school fees will be mostly covered by the chinese government and I myself am contributing $1000 of my saving to help with this. All that we need now is his airfare to and from beijing (estimated $600) and money to cover his accomodation and food for a years stay at the school(estimated$1900).All money raised will be going directly to Nantachai. And if we dont reach the goal I will endevour to find alternative ways to bridge the finacial gap for I dont want him to miss out on this once in a lifetime opportunity.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>
<p>In Thailand, Nantachai was only ever able to work for tip money, just enough to eat. At this school he will train in acrobatics, taking classes in tumbling, handstand, martial arts and tight rope. He will train with other artists from around the world, sharing ideas and creating good industry contacts. And, with his existing skills and natural ability I believe this opportunity would give him a chance to enter the world stage, performing in western coutnries and being able to earn enough money to support his family and give himself a far better life. For at the moment he can't afford to rent a bungalow and his mother is struggling to buy formula for his baby brother.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't help I thank you for taking the time to read this and  please tell all your friends about him for every dollar will help!</p>

<h3>About Danger</h3>
<p>Born and bred in the Garden State, I hail from the shores of the Atlantic Ocean in Asbury Park, NJ. In my childhood I was surrounded by performers and their art, where my imagination was encouraged to flourish. I have been writing for 10 years and have been participating at Loser Slam for the past 3. Aside from honing my craft as a writer, I have set my sights on competing nationally for my venue.</p>
<p>As most poets are wont to do, I try to capture otherwise faint blips of emotion, and use them to connect, inspire, and motivate. My writing is usually image heavy and tends to pack a punch. Every piece is crafted with the intention of being able to share my story as vividly and as beautifully as I can.</p>
<p>I am excited to announce that I will be competing at WOWps (Women of the World Poetry Slam) as Loser Slam's representative.</p>
</div>

Women of the World Poetry Slam is one of the three national events for poetry slam. It started in 2008 as a way to offer women a national-level competition to express their voices. Our host city this year is Minneapolis, Minnesota.</p>
<h3>How you can help</h3>
<p>Every single cent that is raised will be going for registration, transportation (car rental and gas money), lodging, and food. Anything left over will go straight back to the Loser Slam hat. </p>

<li>Contribute $40 and you'll get all the previous prizes as well as a signed copy of my first book, ""Journey to the Heart of Danger""</li>

<p><img alt=""The DXTrigger"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4459583/IMG_8327.JPG"" src="""" style="""" title=""The DXTrigger""/></p>
<p>It's the first warm, beautiful day of spring. You've been itching all winter to go riding. You jump on your quad and take off. Ten minutes later you stop. Why? To ease the pain in your throbbing thumb.</p>
<p>The patented DXTrigger is engineered to reduce pain and improve riding dynamics. Our inspiration materialized from the pain and difficulty of long ATV rides. The unique design delivers comfort and performance and works with the standard OEM throttle. </p>
<p><img alt=""Test Ridder"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4459583/rider.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Test Ridder""/></p>
<p>The unique design enables 3 throttle options:</p>
<ul>
<li>""Push"" Traditional thumb throttle</li>
<li>""Trigger Pull"" Comfortable finger throttle</li>
<li>""Pinch"" Dynamic control using fingers and thumb</li>
</ul>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>More comfortable ride</li>
<li>Better grip enhances throttle control over rough terrain</li>
<li>A more natural hand movement with the ""pinch""</li>
<li>Easier for women, children, and small-handed creatures</li>
<li>Benefits people with thumb disabilities or arthritic conditions</li>
</ul>
<p>We took it to the riders, both recreational and professional, and enjoyed watching their eyes light up and smiles grow big as they used the DXTrigger.</p>
<p><img alt=""Test riders"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4459583/interview.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Test riders""/></p>
<p><strong>Who we are </strong></p>
<p>We are a team of 10 creative minds with expertise in engineering, robotics, manufacturing, quality assurance and business. Most importantly, we all share the same passion and drive: innovating, inventing, and improving the world.</p>
<p>We have enjoyed the DXTrigger for years and think it's time that you should, too.  </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>

</div></div>","It's the first warm, beautiful day of spring. You've been itching all winter to go riding. You jump on your quad and take off. Ten minutes later you stop. Why? To ease the pain in your throbbing thumb.
The patented DXTrigger is engineered to reduce pain and improve riding dynamics. Our inspiration materialized from the pain and difficulty of long ATV rides. The unique design delivers comfort and performance and works with the standard OEM throttle. 

The unique design enables 3 throttle options:

""Push"" Traditional thumb throttle
""Trigger Pull"" Comfortable finger throttle
""Pinch"" Dynamic control using fingers and thumb

Benefits:

More comfortable ride
Better grip enhances throttle control over rough terrain
A more natural hand movement with the ""pinch""
Easier for women, children, and small-handed creatures
Benefits people with thumb disabilities or arthritic conditions

We took it to the riders, both recreational and professional, and enjoyed watching their eyes light up and smiles grow big as they used the DXTrigger.

Who we are 
We are a team of 10 creative minds with expertise in engineering, robotics, manufacturing, quality assurance and business. Most importantly, we all share the same passion and drive: innovating, inventing, and improving the world.
We have enjoyed the DXTrigger for years and think it's time that you should, too.

<h3>What?</h3>
<p>It is the biggest beer on Playa, the Czech beer tradition embodied in huge beer mug. The well known mug - chubby glass with handle, with golden body and white fluffy foam hat. <span class=""il"">Mirage</span>. When you see <span class=""il"">mirages</span> on the Playa and the heat is making your mind see the things you want to see, suddenly there is a giant beer mug standing in front of you and stream for it - and you are saved in the middle of the desert.</p>

Made of ribbed wooden structure from solid wooden beams with white foam from balloons on top. The effigy is of round shape and it will look as a huge beer mug from every direction. We want to place the handle on the side, parallel to the man. We are sure people will love to pose for pictures as ""holding"" the beer with the man in background.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><span>Aloha!</span></p>
<p><span> I’m humbly asking for your support.</span></p>
<p><span> I’m a skilled artist having attended 5 years of schooling with many famous master artist. I worked my way through art school managing a construction business before the US economy took a down spin in 2008. After 5 long years without work, living only for work trade for shared space or tent at times, I never lost site of my dream to work full time as an artist. Now I have been blessed, staying focused on my art, finally my art portfolio has awarded me an apprenticeship as a tattoo artist. I’ve received my required state license and I’m Currently doing my required 50-60 tattoos on friends before I can start earning money as a tattoo artist. The Art of tattoo is a very difficult task to master, while perfecting this art I need an additional income to help me along the way. I have been accepted into a local gallery as well but my production is slow due to lack of materials.</span></p>
<p> Raising Funds to go to las vegas for a tattoo removal course and certification will add to my tattoo apprenticeship and able me the needed income to promote my art work as an oil painter and tattoo artist.</p>
<p> This is my Plan to fund the promotion and the art supplies, to further my skills as an Impressionistic Oil painter and tattoo artist.</p>
<p>Some one asked why the pink Cadillac?</p>
<p>The Pink Cadillac stands for change. The pink cadillac is a painting that I decided to break away from realism and move twards imprissionism. So I started with the sky and incorperated brush strokes with feeling, and so the story goes. Blessed to have the realism training as it is a great help in learning the art of tattoo, however when I paint with oil paints I enjoy a more impressionistic style, with feeling. </p>

<h3>How to Sell Like Jesus</h3>
<p>I was born in the slums of Bombay, India, the only son to Catholic Anglo Indian parents whom i lost to alcoholism. I thereafter spent the majority of my childhood as an errand boy for my aunt who provided an education in return.</p>
<p>After a great deal of relentless effort to get ahead in life by trying everything and anything i possibly could, i hit upon the idea of trying to apply the words of Jesus in my business life.</p>
<p>I picked Jesus because He was the only 24/7 clearly successful marketing guru i could afford. He was free!!! </p>
<p>That's when the magic happened and in a short span of 10 years i built a hugely successful pan-Asian publishing/Communications business without ever once revealing what made me successful. It was my secret that i would not share with anyone.</p>
<p>In early 2013, i met with a terrible accident in Hong Kong and was hospitalised for nearly two months. Doctors had nearly given up on me when one night i felt a presence in the hospital ward. Instinctively, i knew it was God and i begged for my life on behalf of my two young children.   </p>
<p>The following morning doctors informed me that there was a turnaround in my condition. That same night i felt the presence again and asked what i could do to express my gratitude. I felt told to share my success secrets with those who are now where i once was -- struggling to get ahead in life.</p>
<p>I said - ""No this is a bad idea. Why should i share? Who would believe me? The world was not grateful to You when you were here. In return for Your love we nailed You to the cross and haven't stopped celebrating that shameful act, since. NO! Anything but that! I protested.</p>
<p>He remained unmoved. It was either that or nothing. </p>
<p>Soon after being discharged from hospital i told my colleagues this tale and they believed. They gave me the time and space to write How to Sell Like Jesus which i completed in a little under three weeks. </p>
<p>A series of events unfolded including people who I had never met before appearing out of thin air to help me make the book a reality and publish it on Kindle Amazon. Here is the link for the free preview. -- <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/How-Sell-Like-Jesus-ebook/dp/B00AVKZVJE/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357085667&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=How+to+Sell+Like+Jesus"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/How-Sell-Like-Jesus-ebook/dp/B00AVKZVJE/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357085667&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=How+to+Sell+Like+Jesus</a></p>
<p>I began a facebook page (<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/HowToSellLikeJesus"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.facebook.com/HowToSellLikeJesus</a>) therafter and under less than 2 months, the book has nearly 10,000 Likes from more than 15 countries. Questions pour in from readers and i try to answer them each morning after asking Jesus what to write. </p>
<p>ALL THE LETTERS still appear there and i invite you to inspect each and everyone of these before you make your decision to support How to Sell Like Jesus. </p>
<p>Those reading the book and the Q&amp;A on the facebook site have testified that they do not believe i am capable of the answers i have written. I believe so too. </p>
<p>Friends came forward with time, talent and money to help make the site <a href=""http://www.howtoselllikejesus.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.howtoselllikejesus.com</a>  and we produced the first print run of 2000 copies that are now selling in Hong Kong and the Philippines for US$15 and US$8 resply.</p>
<p>MY CAMPAIGN: I want to be able to make the printed copy available to as many book stores in as many countries as possible eventually But THIS campaign is targetted at having the print copies at least in a few stores in the United States, India and more stores the Philippines.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is important to me that i do whatever i am capable of, to bridge the gap between God and His people so that more can benefit professionally and personally as i have.  </p>
<p>Your contribution will help get How to Sell Like Jesus to at least ONE bookstore in every state in the US, India and the Philippines. This will mean setting up a small company and printing in those countries so as to keep costs low and eliminate transport and/or mailing.</p>
<p>I will also need to make testimonial videos for each of my targetted three countries to as to creat more awarness of this unique resource.   </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What We Need </strong></p>
<p>I need at least US$100,000 to set up a small registered legal identity company in these countries, print and promote locally and have at least ONE bookstore in each state keep the book and price it at least at US$15 so as to keep it affordable.</p>
<p>The goal is to have at least 1000 copies in each of these three countries to start with and replinish as they are sold. Money will also be spent to promote the book in the form of book signings, social networking platforms, testimony videos etc. </p>
<p>Contributors will be able to follow the book's progress on the site as well as on the book's facebook site.</p>

<p>Each contributor gets his/her name aside an angel depicted on the site's page --  <a href=""http://www.howtoselllikejesus.com/angels.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.howtoselllikejesus.com/angels.html</a> and those contributing more than US$25 get their name and photo (if they wish) on the ANGELS page in a listing that we will feature beneath the world map illustration.  </p>
<p>If i don't reach my goal, the funds will be used to make promotional tools like testimony videos, illustrations, social networking ads etc to help draw more people to engage with the book's facebook site and benefit from the shared wisdom unfolding there from reader's letters and God's answers to them.  </p>
<p>If this particular fund raising effort is not deemed successful by God, i will persist in my efforts until i realise my dream in making How to Sell Like Jesus available to those who need it most. This has become my life's cause and will only stop when God calls me to eternally rest at His feet. </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>This project is about opening people's eyes by tearing off the blindfold and schackles that our cunning society progressively ensalves us with from the moment we are born. Proof fo this is all over us. Look what our 'well-meaning society' has led us -- to the brink of WWIII. See how so many are poor and so few are rich?</p>
<p>This projest is about empowering our young by showing them proof of how honesty, sincerity, love for our fellow being makes AWESOME BUSINESS SENSE!  </p>
<p>Each chapter in How to Sell Like Jesus shows how I discovered the awesome power in Jesus' simple words and applied them to HUGE sucess in my professional life as a salesman. </p>
<p>I believe that no matter HOW DISADVANTAGED you may be, if you do your part honestly, using His principles, He will help you to get WHATSOEVER IS BEYOND YOUR REACH!. This is what the little youtube video we made, shows. </p>

The Burlesque Boutique LLC is the first of its kind here
in Seattle; we offer top of the line burlesque accessories,
performance material, and educational items in a cozy and classy
lounge style shop. Our Goal is to be open by Summer 2011! 





Our target market is professional and seasonal
burlesque, boylesque, cabaret, and drag performers; the novice,
daring housewives, gift giving lovers, your nine-to-fiver, and the
little diva in all of us that want to be sparkly. 






While
there are many places around Seattle that carry products performers
use, The Burlesque Boutique is the only place one can meet all his or
her burlesque needs at one location. We are a one stop shop. Our goal
is to supply performers with all their accessory and embellishment
must haves. We will educate the inform the public about the 'The Art of the Tease' with books, magazines, and movies dedicated to Burlesque. We aim to build good will and community by selling items made by local burlesque performers, participating in community events, and referring
to other retailers and vendors.

Management
of The Burlesque Boutique is headed by its owner, Tanya Harris, with
eleven years of extensive retail experience and a Bachelors of
Science in Fashion Merchandising. Ms. Harris will have a hands-on
approach in the company. Harris is also a respected and well known
performer, Ruby Mimosa, with international burlesque troope The
Atomic Bombshells, and instructor at Miss Indigo Blue's Academy of
Burlesque.


Burlesque is happening around the globe! There is a
major resurgence occurring throughout the United States, Europe,
Australia, and Asia. Amazingly enough, many of the international
performers who participate in festivals worldwide live right here in
Seattle. The late Gypsy Rose Lee, a pinnacle woman in the Golden Age
of Burlesque profiled in the theatrical movie “Gypsy”, is from

What We Need & What You Get


Here's the dish! I am looking to raise a total of $57,000 for the initial start up of the Burlesque Boutique. With IndieGoGo, I am fundraising for $7,000. The amount raised will go to the purchase of our inventory, purchase of

oppression and violence. Rigoberto sees his paintings as contemporary visual 
corridos, which are not made up of rhyme and verse, but instead of paint and 
movement. </span></p>

Our 
Story
Mexican-American 
artist Rigoberto A. Gonzalez has the opportunity to exhibit his 
powerful paintings about the drug wars across the Texas-Mexico border in the 
heart of Houston, which is the fourth largest city in America. In order to make 
this powerful exhibition happen, his paintings need to be trucked approximately 
792 miles from Las 
Cruces, New Mexico. It will take $2,000 in gas, drivers and insurance to move the work for an 
exhibition at the Art League Houston opening on March 9.  If 
you can help get the work here, the space is available and the media is 
interested! Let 
the people of Houston see this work for the first time, hear the story it tells 
and reconsider the power of art to address the most difficult of issues. 
 
About 
the paintings

Gonzalez 
created the paintings in Roswell, New Mexico, and was 
inspired by the violent confrontations between drug cartels, Mexican federal 
troops, and people involved in illegal immigration in his home town of Reynosa; 
a border city in the northern part of Mexico.


The 
artist paints in a Baroque-style found in the 17th century paintings by artist 
such as Caravaggio and Jusepe de Ribera.  This style often incorporates 
storytelling as away to depict great historical dramas, with rich colors, and 
symbolism.


Rigoberto 
brings an additional voice to this story with a reference to the rich tradition 
of storytelling by placing the portraits of two musicians into his paintings. 
The musicians are playing songs known as a corridos, which are a narrative 
tradition in northern Mexico and usually express unpleasant stories about 
oppression and violence. Rigoberto sees his paintings as contemporary visual 
corridos, which are not made up of rhyme and verse, but instead of paint and 
movement. 




Impact




Rigoberto's 
paintings will highlight the rich historical tradition of artists who express 
violence through the beauty of painting as a way of bringing difficult issues

Rigobertoâ€™s 
paintings will offer the Houston community an artistic snapshot of what is 
happening on the order side of the border and express a voice for the people who 
are affected.  



The 
work will motivate the community to raise important questions about what is exactly  happening on the border, and why artists throughout history have chosen

more will be explored and talked about in panel discussions at Art League 
Houston and Talento 
BilingÃ¼e de Houtson in Houston.

Hypocrisy within these movements and discourses is the main focus point of her work.""</span><br/><br/><br/><font size=""3""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Hello, my name is TINKEBELL. <br/></span></font>Im a Dutch artist and currently working on a large project called ""SAVE THE WORLD"". For this project I travel around the world to 'save' people, animals, places and situations 'according to the Dutch norms'<br/>SAVE THE WORLD in South Korea<br/><br/>In January 2012 I'm planning to visit South Korea...<br/>Earlier this year I 'saved' a dog in Gambia, a family in Guinea Bissau, 69 turtles from being eaten in China and a complete neighborhood in Peru. All were part of her SAVE THE WORLD project: Interventions worldwide that explore what happens when we force our (Western) view of the world on other cultures.<br/><br/><br style=""font-weight: bold;""/><font size=""3""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">About the project</span></font><br/>When we, as Western people, or more specific, born in the Netherlands, travel around the world, to countries which are “less Western” or just “differt”  (which is in fact every place outside the Netherlands) we all experience the same thing: We se see how people, situatations, animals, ‘things’ are treated in a wrong way. Things arent organized well (enough) and the way people live, roads are made, buildings are build is done badly.<br/><br/> Everything is always better in the Netherlands. We know how to get things done and how the world should be organized.<br/><br/>This feeling shows up especially at the moments we experience cultures that are different from ours. Even in countries that, at first sight, look very close to our own culture.<br/><br/>And this feeling that we have as Dutch people, is often not just a feeling. There are many cases where we also act towards it:<br/><br/>For example: We have an organization in the Netherlands that asks Dutch foreigners when they are on vacation in certain countries, to get street dogs from, for example Spain, on the plane to the Netherlands. This organization places these dogs in families to keep them as a pet. Because, according to this organization: The dog has the right to be loved and taken care of by a family.<br/><br/>When we travel to Africa for a nice warm holiday in the sun, it is completely normal to bring an extra suitcase flled with our own old clothes: To give away to the people there: An ideal way to get rid of your junk and at the same time getting the feeling to do something good for the world.<br/><br/>The thing we often forget in these “good deeds” is to communicate. Do you actually need our help? And if so, what kind of help can I (we) offer? Even at times we do ask ‘locals’ about how they feel it doesn't really matter what they say. We keep thinking that “the don't know any better”.<br/><br/>Isnt it pure arrogance to think that everything is better the we handle things? That our norms are superior next to any other culture? And that, without having the experience to live in a different cultural environment?<br/><br/><br/>The project “SAVE THE WORLD” is a project about this clash between different cutures. The need to help people to pamper our own ego without communication with the “needed”.<br/><br/><br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/713GKdwJfUk"" width=""560""></iframe></div><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><font size=""3""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The plan</span></font><br/> With this project “SAVE THE WORLD” I want, beside the signalised clash, also discuss our own norms we use as a base to ‘help’.<br/><br/>Through a series of interventions in about 10 different countries spread over the world I’m planning to ‘save’ people, nimals, situations etc. to our Dutch norm. In this way, by decontextualizing this norm, I hope to show this clash to my audience and I also hope to create a discussion about the imperfectness of our own norms.<br/><br/>Between these interventions I present my world saving activities to a large audience at multi media art centre Mediamatic in Amsterdam (NL). The audience there will also be my think tank for future interventions within this project and with every presentations there will be speakers from different groups like NGO’s, philosophers, politicians etc.<br/><br/><br/>At the end of these SAVE THE WORLD series there will be an overall exhibition about the project at Mediamatic and TOCHGallery in Amsterdam and at the Active Space in NYC. (end 2012/begin 2013)<br/>At the same time there will be a book published (SAVE THE WORLD) with an overview of all interventions, presented as a personal diary.<br/>Finally there will also be the presentation of a documentary made by “Jan de Bruin”: He follows me during the whole project for this film and meanwhile he makes short films to present all the interventions separately.<br/><br/>What I hope to achieve is a new, more open way of thinking about- and looking at our way of “helping” all over the world. What are the changes if we throw away this feeling of living in a superior culture?<br/><br/> <br/><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Reconcideration of norms and redefining ‘help’.</span><br/><br/><br/><font size=""3""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">How I work</span></font><br/>In the gallery you find the movies of previous interventions in Gambia, Guinea Bissau, China and Peru to give you an idea of what I’m planning to do in about 10 different countries spread over the world in the next 2 years.<br/><br/>Every time when I arrive in another country, I will do some research first.

Hypocrisy within these movements and discourses is the main focus point of her work.""Hello, my name is TINKEBELL. Im a Dutch artist and currently working on a large project called ""SAVE THE WORLD"". For this project I travel around the world to 'save' people, animals, places and situations 'according to the Dutch norms'SAVE THE WORLD in South KoreaIn January 2012 I'm planning to visit South Korea...Earlier this year I 'saved' a dog in Gambia, a family in Guinea Bissau, 69 turtles from being eaten in China and a complete neighborhood in Peru. All were part of her SAVE THE WORLD project: Interventions worldwide that explore what happens when we force our (Western) view of the world on other cultures.About the projectWhen we, as Western people, or more specific, born in the Netherlands, travel around the world, to countries which are “less Western” or just “differt”  (which is in fact every place outside the Netherlands) we all experience the same thing: We se see how people, situatations, animals, ‘things’ are treated in a wrong way. Things arent organized well (enough) and the way people live, roads are made, buildings are build is done badly. Everything is always better in the Netherlands. We know how to get things done and how the world should be organized.This feeling shows up especially at the moments we experience cultures that are different from ours. Even in countries that, at first sight, look very close to our own culture.And this feeling that we have as Dutch people, is often not just a feeling. There are many cases where we also act towards it:For example: We have an organization in the Netherlands that asks Dutch foreigners when they are on vacation in certain countries, to get street dogs from, for example Spain, on the plane to the Netherlands. This organization places these dogs in families to keep them as a pet. Because, according to this organization: The dog has the right to be loved and taken care of by a family.When we travel to Africa for a nice warm holiday in the sun, it is completely normal to bring an extra suitcase flled with our own old clothes: To give away to the people there: An ideal way to get rid of your junk and at the same time getting the feeling to do something good for the world.The thing we often forget in these “good deeds” is to communicate. Do you actually need our help? And if so, what kind of help can I (we) offer? Even at times we do ask ‘locals’ about how they feel it doesn't really matter what they say. We keep thinking that “the don't know any better”.Isnt it pure arrogance to think that everything is better the we handle things? That our norms are superior next to any other culture? And that, without having the experience to live in a different cultural environment?The project “SAVE THE WORLD” is a project about this clash between different cutures. The need to help people to pamper our own ego without communication with the “needed”.The plan With this project “SAVE THE WORLD” I want, beside the signalised clash, also discuss our own norms we use as a base to ‘help’.Through a series of interventions in about 10 different countries spread over the world I’m planning to ‘save’ people, nimals, situations etc. to our Dutch norm. In this way, by decontextualizing this norm, I hope to show this clash to my audience and I also hope to create a discussion about the imperfectness of our own norms.Between these interventions I present my world saving activities to a large audience at multi media art centre Mediamatic in Amsterdam (NL). The audience there will also be my think tank for future interventions within this project and with every presentations there will be speakers from different groups like NGO’s, philosophers, politicians etc.At the end of these SAVE THE WORLD series there will be an overall exhibition about the project at Mediamatic and TOCHGallery in Amsterdam and at the Active Space in NYC. (end 2012/begin 2013)At the same time there will be a book published (SAVE THE WORLD) with an overview of all interventions, presented as a personal diary.Finally there will also be the presentation of a documentary made by “Jan de Bruin”: He follows me during the whole project for this film and meanwhile he makes short films to present all the interventions separately.What I hope to achieve is a new, more open way of thinking about- and looking at our way of “helping” all over the world. What are the changes if we throw away this feeling of living in a superior culture? Reconcideration of norms and redefining ‘help’.How I workIn the gallery you find the movies of previous interventions in Gambia, Guinea Bissau, China and Peru to give you an idea of what I’m planning to do in about 10 different countries spread over the world in the next 2 years.Every time when I arrive in another country, I will do some research first. What is different from our norms and where do I get the urge to intervene, to help?So, I cant say on forehand what I will do while I’m visiting a new place. It is all based on described concept and then, research at the location where I am.The average time I need for that will be around 4 or 5 weeks per country, with the possibility that I have to come back (like in the Guinea Bissau example) to work things out. So, what do I need?That's hard to say because at the moment I decide exactly what to do is when I'm already in South Korea. So, I can tell you know that the price of a plane ticket will be about $1000,- and staying and living in or around Seoul for one month will be about $2500,-The average amount I've spent per intervention is about $15000,- So that's the amount of money I try to raise here right now.Other ways you can helpSpread the word!!! Tell your friends/family/neighbors that the best Christmas gift ever is (to) SAVE THE WORLD!!!Besides that: Maybe you have a house, an apartment or any opportunity to invite me somewhere.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>It began at best buy, I was in a box.</p>
<p>I was put over the counter and carried away.</p>
<p>I knew my purpose,  but had no idea of the journey's yet to come.</p>
<p>I heard though the box that the lady had sold all her expensive bags to buy me.</p>
<p>I knew at that moment I was in for a good life with her.</p>
<p>After a few weeks of my buttons being clicked and a lot of deleting and I was on a plane.</p>
<p>Together her and I captured putting a Cambodian child in school, then we climbed the Great Wall of China.</p>
<p>I was brand new and had already traveled to two countries!</p>
<p>A month later I was back in NYC and always around her shoulder, we were in so many places capturing talent and random adventures.</p>
<p>The next trip to Cambodia I found myself in a village capturing children capturing images, my mom was teaching them how to use camera's just like me but smaller. </p>
<p>I got really dirty shooting a bathroom being built and learning center being erected.</p>
<p>We went on so many trips and I was able to capture Cambodia's first hip hop festival, it was incredible!</p>
<p>After 6 months I was back in NYC again and we met this young woman who sings like an angel, from then on I saw her everyday and recorded her feats all over New York as well as SxSw in Texas.</p>
<p>I was excited to leave and anticipated another adventure opportunity would arise and I was right!  May of  2011 we went to Mexico just mama photo and I. We were doing more stuff with kids and beads and yarn. </p>
<p>Within two weeks I was right back in NYC and yes again following the angel singer to all sorts of venues where crowds of people cheered loudly.</p>
<p>The following month we packed up in a car and hit the road. We traveled all over the USA on a music tour, Vans  Warped something, I can't remember all these names:) I even was used while my mom was driving! She's always so brave with me, and I always felt safe to take the shot.</p>
<p>Summer passed and it was back to NYC running all over to different music venues capturing the angel singer.</p>
<p>I knew we would be on the road again soon, my mom cant sit still for long! But before that would happen I would witness all the work I had done with her in this giant bright gallery! WOW did we create! I was happy to see our images not through us, but through others.</p>
<p>Last week i realized we'd be going back to Mexico and to other places around the area, mom the angel singer and me. It would be so nice to capture those happy children learning again!</p>
<p>We arrived and I was soon thrown over her shoulder ( my very favorite place to be) we took a long metro and bus to these Giant ancient temples called Teotihuancan, hope I spelled that right! I have never captured anything so big besides the Great wall and I was so inspired.</p>
<p>We captured all day her and I, even the angel singer started using me. I was loved, i was fulfilling my purpose.</p>
<p>The bus ride home my mom was tired and zipped me up tight in the top of her bag, i wish i could've talked cause I would have told her that there were four men watching me and her.</p>
<p>I felt my case being tussled and in a snap I was taken by hands I did not know!</p>
<p>I am now lost in Mexico somewhere and I am very sad to be away from my mom and our friend!  What really hurts the most is that I cant be there to help her capture their humanitarian and musical adventures.</p>
<p>All things happen for a reason and the people that took me must need me more than she does, but I am still upset to be separated so suddenly, it will all be very different now….</p>
<p>I know I will be ok but I hope that she will have another me asap!!! Maybe if you are reading this you can help….</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>The Semi-Permanent Autonomous Zone (aka the <a href=""http://www.spaz.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""spaz.org"">S.P.A.Z.</a> collective) has been organizing social events, community spaces, free festivals, art happenings and more for nearly 20 years. Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, we've also traveled around the United States, Europe, and Asia creating unique situations for people to come together and experience art and music in a liberated social environment. We roll in diesel buses that we've converted to run on recycled vegetable oil, and we're equipped to transform any space into a vibrant, stimulating, living, breathing social sculpture. Our crew is made up of multi-talented creative individuals with a combined skill set ranging from bus mechanics and sound design to textile arts, and circus skills. We haven't done a proper tour in a few years and we're eager to share what we've been up to in the Bay Area with people far and wide. To get back into the swing, we've decided to organize a West Coast mini-tour this summer, beginning in mid-july.  We'll travel from the Bay Area northwards visiting towns, cities, and isolated rural areas setting up art and music environments, children's art workshops,independent film screenings, dance parties, and more....</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
If we raise our full target amount, we'll buy a new diesel coach, do a full vegetable oil fuel conversion and build out the interior to accommodate our crew and equipment. Our current bus is great and can do the job, but it's been on the road with us now for over 10 years and many cross-country missions. It's getting more expensive and time-consuming to keep it roadworthy and safe, and we'd like to focus our energy on our creative work.  Any funds left over will be used to maintain the vehicle on tour, buy art supplies and materials for installations and workshops, and feed the crew. A fully-funded tour will also allow us to do mostly free events...</div>

<p>We want to introduce you to a new local initiative - New Orleans Independent Fashion is an emerging collective of fashion designers, entrepreneurs and professionals in the New Orleans Area.  <i>Our mission is to uplift and support local fashion designers while also creating economic opportunities and avenues to connect with local buyers. </i></p>
<p>We are currently planning a series of three events culminating in our first showcase to present at the Happyland Theater in the Bywater on Thursday, October 24 and need your support to make this evening memorable.</p>
<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">We are seeking bold businesses and individuals to support our first showcase so that we can build a network of designers, buyers and industry professionals in the Gulf South Region. Our long-term vision is to bring attention to New Orleans as a center for fashion innovation. In the meantime, we need your support to begin this process, and an evening of fun and enchantment is the best start we can imagine.</span><p> </p>
<p>Our first presentation will exhibit ten emerging and established designers in New Orleans.  We will feature the designs of:</p>
<p>Maria Sandhammer</p>
<p>Cree McCree</p>
<p>Corinne Margaret Fibers</p>
<p>Calamity</p>
<p>EKS</p>
<p>Howlpop</p>

We are currently planning a series of three events culminating in our first showcase to present at the Happyland Theater in the Bywater on Thursday, October 24 and need your support to make this evening memorable.
We are seeking bold businesses and individuals to support our first showcase so that we can build a network of designers, buyers and industry professionals in the Gulf South Region. Our long-term vision is to bring attention to New Orleans as a center for fashion innovation. In the meantime, we need your support to begin this process, and an evening of fun and enchantment is the best start we can imagine. 
Our first presentation will exhibit ten emerging and established designers in New Orleans.  We will feature the designs of:
Maria Sandhammer
Cree McCree
Corinne Margaret Fibers
Calamity
EKS
Howlpop
and more!
