<p>Tyler has been active in martial arts since the age of 4 years old. In 2005 he began aiding in the instruction of judo for the Fountain Police Activities League, and has been doing so since. Accumulating well over 400 hours of community service. At the age of 15 Tyler obtained his 1st degree black belt in Yoshin-ryu jitsu. At the age of 16 he obtained his 1st degree black belt in USA Ju-jitsu and also Traditional Kodokan Judo. As well as instructing judo and jujitsu, Tyler has been an avid competitor throughout the years. He has been a state grappling champion under the Colorado Karate Association (CKA) for three consecutive years in a row (06', 07', 08'). The last year Tyler competed in the CKA (08') he placed second in state in another grappling division. Only due to lack of points for moving up a weight class, by choice not necessity, in the middle of the tournament season. Aside from teaching judo and jujitsu, Tyler is also a Krav Maga instructor for Krav Maga of Southern Colorado. Having obtained his official instructor certification at the beginning of this year.

<p class=""Body1"">My name is Bretta.  I'm a newly minted graduate with degrees in biology and public health and a passion for justice and equality in access healthcare around the world.  Fifteen years ago, when I was very young, my family moved to Haiti where my eyes were opened to the burden of poverty and disease suffered by so many around the world.  In the years since I left Haiti, I have studied and volunteered in many places across the globe including the Dominican Republic, Bolivia, Tanzania, Kenya, and Sudan, where I have learned valuable lessons about working with people from different cultures to effect lasting change in community health.  During these experiences, my desire to return to Haiti has only increased so that I can apply what I have learned and make a positive and lasting difference in my old home.  Now, I have the chance that I've been waiting for, and I am asking for your help to make it happen.</p>
<p class=""Body1""> </p>
<h3 class=""Body1""><strong>The Project, and How I Got Involved</strong></h3>
<p class=""Body1"">This spring, I volunteered in the Portland office of Konbit Sante, a wonderful non-profit organization which has been working in northern Haiti for more than ten years.  A few weeks after I started, my supervisor asked if I would be interested in exploring a six-month supply chain project at a hospital in Haiti.  I hardly even needed to stop and think about it - of course the answer was yes!</p>
<p class=""Body1"">So what exactly is supply chain, and why does it matter?  Simply put, the supply chain is the system that gets medicines, supplies, and equipment to the people who need them, and it's important because no hospital can function without it.  Surgeons can't operate without gloves, cholera patients can't be rehydrated without IVs and saline, and tuberculosis can't be treated without appropriate medicine.  The hospital where I will be working has a team of highly skilled nurses and doctors, but because of systemic problems with their supply chain, it is very difficult for them to do their jobs.  Reforming the system to get them the medicines and supplies that they need is the best way to help them save the lives of their patients.</p>
<p class=""Body1""> </p>
<h3 class=""Body1""><strong>Where Your Money Will Go</strong></h3>
<p class=""Body1"">I am asking for your help to raise $3,455 to cover the cost of my trip.  The line items are as follows:</p>
<p class=""Body1"">Roundtrip flight from Boston to Haiti:  $900</p>
<p class=""Body1"">Emergency medical evacuation insurance:  $205</p>
<p class=""Body1"">Rent:  $2000</p>
<p class=""Body1"">In-country transportation: $350</p>
<p class=""Body1"">Note:  Any contributions above and beyond my fundraising goal will be given to Konbit Sante to put toward the salaries of the local Haitian staff at the hospital.  If I am unable to raise enough money to make my trip possible, all the funds I raise here will be directed to Konbit Sante's programs in Haiti. </p>
<h3 class=""Body1""><strong><br/></strong></h3>
<h3 class=""Body1""><strong>Tax Deduction Receipts are Available!</strong></h3>
<p>Because Konbit Sante is a registered 501(c)3 non-profit organization, your contribution is TAX DEDUCTIBLE.  All you have to do is claim a perk and supply your mailing address, and we will mail a receipt to you at the end of our campaign.  (Note:  If, for any reason, you want a receipt, but do NOT want a perk, just claim the perk and contact me afterward or post a comment.  All recipts will be mailed at the conclusion of the campaign.)</p>

<p class=""Body1"">In Haitian Creole, a <em>konbit</em> is a traditional Haitian method of working together to till your friends' fields as well as your own.  <em>Sante</em> means health.  So the name means ""working together for health.""  Konbit Sante's mission is to support the development of a sustainable health care system to meet the needs of the Haitian community with maximum local direction and support.  KS has worked in the Cap-Haitien area of Haiti for more than ten years and supports the local health system through:</p>
<p class=""Body1"">-Clinical work</p>
<p class=""Body1"">-Children's health programs</p>
<p class=""Body1"">-Infrastructure projects</p>
<p class=""Body1"">-Supply chain support</p>
<p class=""Body1"">-Crisis response</p>
<p class=""Body1"">After the 2010 earthquake, Konbit Sante took immediate action and helped to meet the needs of earthquake victims by providing transport from Port-au-Prince to the Cap-Haitien hospital, paying the costs of treatment, purchasing and transporting medical supplies from the Dominican Republic, and supporting efforts to distribute food, water and sanitary items in camps in the Port-au-Prince area.</p>
<p class=""Body1"">Konbit Sante has also worked tirelessly to meet the challenges of the cholera epidemic which began shortly after the earthquake and spread like wildfire due to the lack of a sanitation system and clean drinking water.  Victims of cholera are exposed through contaminated drinking water, may show symptoms within 3-5 hours of exposure, and often die due to rapid dehydration.  The Cap-Haitian area has been hit very hard by the epidemic, and KS has responded both by expanding access to clean drinking water and by helping to set up treatment support centers where cholera victims can be saved through aggressive rehydration therapy.</p>

 Menschen im Ausland würden gerne Waren bei deutschen Händlern bestellen
 und können das auch. Aber viele Händler liefern ausschließlich im 
Inland. Die gleiche Erfahrung machen auch viele Deutsche, die sich zum 
Beispiel als Arbeitnehmer, Rentner, Studenten oder Soldaten dauerhaft im
 Ausland befinden. Sie kommen außerdem nicht mehr ohne Weiteres an ihre 
Post.  
 
</p><p>Mit
 unserer Idee schaffen wir es ganz einfach diese Hürde zu überwinden: 
All unsere Kunden erhalten bei uns einen Lagerplatz und dazu eine <strong>deutsche Lieferadresse</strong>,
 an die sie <strong>Pakete, Briefe und Zeitschriften</strong> zu Inlandskonditionen 
liefern lassen können. Einmal hier angekommen kann dann jeder in seinem 
Kundenaccount bestimmen, wann seine Sendungen an seine Heimatadresse 
geschickt werden sollen und ob das einzeln passiert oder mehrere in ein 
großes Paket umgepackt werden sollen. Die gewünschten Waren oder die

man in einem fremden Land wenn das eigene Auto kaputt geht? Paul,
einem Freund ist genau das in Brasilien passiert.
Unterwegs auf einer Reise durch Lateinamerika hatte er seinen BMW
Mini von Streetart-Künstlern gestalten lassen. Dann brach ihm nach
20.000 Kilometern die Kupplung.</p>
<p>In einer
Werkstatt sagte man ihm, die Kupplung koste 2.000$ und die Lieferzeit
sei ungewiss. Darauf wollte sich Paul nicht einlassen. Aber sein Auto
zurückzulassen kam für ihn nicht in Frage. Glücklicherweise gab es
Rettung. In einem deutschen Online Shop hatte er eine Kupplung für
185€ gefunden, doch der Händler wollte nicht außerhalb
Deutschlands liefern. So rief er bei uns an und fragte ob wir die
Kupplung für ihn entgegennehmen und nach Brasilien schicken.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/557557/files/20140505025336-chasing_the_sun.jpg?1399283616"" src="""" style=""width: 553.4117647058823px; height: 368px;""/></p><p></p><p>Logo,
antworteten wir.Denn mit unserem Onlinehandel Vireo.de verfügen wir über das Know How international zu versenden. So
 sparte Paul eine Menge Geld und Zeit. Und der Mini - steht heute als 
Kunstobjekt im BMW Museum in München. Und aus der Idee ""Sendungen 
weiterzuleiten"" entstand unsere Start-Up-Idee. </p><p><b>Wie grenzenloser Versand Leben retten kann
</b></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Immer wieder erschüttern Produktskandale das Vertrauen der Kunden
in unterschiedlichen Regionen der Welt. Dies weckt bei den
betroffenen oft den Wunsch nach einer alternativen Bezugsquelle. 2008
erschütterte China ein Bericht über verbotene Chemikalien im
Milchpulver. Sechs Babys starben und mindestens 300.000 Kleinkinder
kamen mit Nierensteinen ins Krankenhaus. Seitdem decken viele
Chinesen unter anderem mit deutsche Milchpulver ihren Bedarf.
Austauschstudenten und Touristen versorgen die Bekannten und Freunde
im Heimatland. Doch auch Chinesen die keine Bekannten oder Freunde in
Europa haben würden gerne in Deutschland bestellen. Doch die
Hersteller reagieren mit einer Regulierung des Versands.</span></span></p><p><img align=""left"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://mailboxg.edicy.co/photos/001372ac9cf21027120001.jpg?1397222139313"" src="""" style=""""/></p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">

<p>
Der Teufel steckt im Detail: Will man die Ware unbesehen zum Kunden
schicken? Nimmt das Hotel das Paket richtig entgegen? Wann muss das
Paket abgegeben werden damit es rechtzeitig da ist? Muss ich für
einfache Sendungen gleich in Verhandlung mit Logistikkonzernen gehen?</p>
<p>
Ein Unternehmer meinte im Gespräch er wünsche sich eine Firma, die
ihm seine Sendung für ein paar Tage einlagert. Er würde dann voraus
fliegen und die Ware im Hotel persönlich entgegennehmen.</p>

Prima, meinten wir, denn mit Mailbox Germany bieten wir einen
Weiterleitungsservice der Pakete und Briefe in Deutschland annimmt
und von dort in alle Welt verschickt. Wann und wohin die Sendung

<p><strong>Warum lasse ich mir die Ware nicht vom Onlineshop direkt ins Ausland
schicken?</strong> </p>
<p>50% der Onlineshops in Deutschland versenden nicht aktiv ins Ausland, so
kann es passieren, dass du wichtige Waren nicht bekommst. </p>
<p><strong>Welche Sparte nutzt Mailbox Germany?</strong> </p>
<p>Mailbox Germany agiert im Small Parcel Bereich bis 40kg. Darüber hinaus
agieren internationale Logistikfirmen und Speditionen. </p>
<p><strong>Versendet ihr die Waren selbst?</strong> </p>
<p>Nein, wir versenden ausschließlich mit etablierten, internationalen
Dienstleistern, wie DHL, DPD oder UPS. </p>
<p><strong>Müsst ihr meine Pakete kontrollieren?</strong> </p>
<p>Um die Ausfuhr beim Zollamt anzumelden müssen wir gegebenenfalls in dein
Paket schauen. Den Inhalt von Briefen lassen wir jedoch unangetastet. </p>
<p><strong>Wie verwalte ich meine Briefe und Pakete?</strong> </p>
<p>Das Onlinemanagement ist der Schlüssel. Unser Login-Bereich macht es dir
möglich unsere vielen verschiedenen Services zu buchen und deine Sendungen
einfach zu verwalten. Durch dieses elektronische System können wir dir im
Vergleich zu Logistikfirmen gute und günstige Preise bieten. </p>
<p><strong>Seid ihr ein zugelassener Postdienst? </strong> </p>
<p>Wir haben bereits eine Postlizenz und dürfen damit deine Post und Pakete
offiziell befördern.  </p>
<p><strong>Wie kann ich Mailbox Germany als zweiten Briefkasten nutzen?</strong>
</p>
<p>Du kannst über den Nachsendeservice der deutschen Post deinen Briefkasten
praktisch zu uns umziehen lassen.  </p>

<strong>Our
idea</strong><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""> </span>
</h3>
<p>Many
people abroad like to order goods from Germany and actually can do
that. But most of the traders deliver only domestically. The same
thing is experienced by lot of Germans, who are permanently located
abroad, for example, expatriates, pensioners or soldiers. Moreover,
they can not automatically collect their mail. 
</p>
<p>Our
idea is to overcome this obstacle quite easy: each of our customers
gets some storage place and <b>a
</b><strong><b>German
delivery address</b></strong>,
where they can send <b>packages,
letters and magazines</b>
at the domestic rates. Everyone can check their account, see when the
package has been received here and choose whether to forward it
directly to his home or to combine several shipments into a bigger
one. Then, the desired goods or mails are only one step away.

<b>Cross-border shopping - <br/></b><b>Three example, how we came up with our idea</b>
</h3><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Mailbox Germany
takes Mini Cooper to BWM-Museum</b></p><p>What exactly do you do when your car breaks down in a foreign country?
Exactly this happened to my friend Paul in Brazil. On his journey throughout
South America he had his Mini Cooper designed by street artists. After about
12.000 miles his clutch broke.</p><p>At the dealership he was told that repair costs would amount to $2.000
and that the delivery period would be uncertain. Paul would not let himself get
into this. But leaving his car behind was out of the question. Fortunately,
help was at hand. By searching the internet, he found a clutch for €185 on a website of a German online shop. But the
trader was not willing to deliver outside Germany. That is when Paul called us
to ask if we could take delivery of his clutch and send it to Brazil.</p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/557686/files/20140505034456-chasing_the_sun.jpg?1399286696"" src="""" style=""width: 538.3734015345268px; height: 358px;""/></p><p>Absolutely! Thanks to our online shop Vireo.de we have aquired practical knowledge concerning international shipping.
 Paul was able to save a great amount of money and time. And the Mini- 
is today an object of art and part of the permanent exhibition in the 
BMW Museum in Munich. This is one of the events that brought up the 
startup idea of delivery forwarding. </p><p><b>How shipping across borders
can save lives </b></p><p>All around the world product scandals shatter consumer trust again and
again. People concerned often wish having the choice of an
alternative supplier. In 2008 people in China were terrified by the news and
events of prohibited chemicals that were found in powdered milk.  Six
babies died and at least 300.000 small children with kidney stones had to be
treated in hospitals. Ever since, many Chinese stock up on German powdered milk among other
things. Exchange students and tourists supply their family and friends back home.
But those who do not have relatives or friends in Europe would also like to buy
in Germany. However, manufacturers react with shipping regulations. </p><p>
</p><p><b>With Mailbox Germany we intend to set up a service that offers people residing
outside Germany the opportunity to buy and order products as if they were
living here. </b>Today, people are searching globally for products that their domestic
market does not provide.</p>
<p>In business it often happens that one would like to
take more baggage along than actually authorized by the airlines. Consequently,
the rest is being shipped in a package to its destination. 
</p><p>
</p><p><b>Is it really that easy? </b></p>
<p>The devil is in the detail: Should one really ship goods without prior
inspection to the customer? Will the hotel accept the delivery properly? When
does the package have to be delivered in order to arrive in time? Do I immediately
have to enter into negotiations with haulage companies for a simple shipment? 
</p><p>There was a businessman who expressed the wish that there was a company
that could stock his delivery for a few days until he gets to the hotel to receive
the goods personally.</p><p>Great! That was our first thought since with Mailbox Germany we provide a
forwarding service thanks to which we will receive packages and letters in
Germany and send them across the globe. When and where you want your items to
be shipped lies exclusively in your hands. Our customers can control all
processes easily and transparently online. We deal with the customs declaration
and find the best transport tariff for you. On our website customers can log
into their user account to request shipping of their goods and will be
informed about delivery charges and delivery time. Using the tracking tool on
our website you can check on the delivery status of your items at any time.</p><p><b>Swiss people purchase iPhone 5 before release date</b><br/><br/>No delivery date for the iPhone 5 in Switzerland!

do they not send my packages directly abroad</strong><strong>?</strong>
<span>50%
of online shops in Germany do not actively send abroad, therefore it
may happen that you do not get important goods. </span></p><p><span><strong><span>Which
area does Mailbox Germany operate in? </span></strong>Germany
acts in the Small Parcel Area up to 40kg. For shipments bigger than
that other international logistics companies and freight forwarders
are better suited. </span></p><p><span><strong><span>Do
you ship the goods by yourself? </span></strong>No,
we ship only with established, international service providers, such
as DHL, DPD or UPS. </span></p><p><span><strong><span>Are
you going to check my package? </span></strong>If
it will be necessary,  we will check the content of the package
in order to have it registered at the custom office. However, the
letters are not going to be controlled. </span></p><p><span><strong><span>How
can I manage my mail and packages? </span></strong>The
online management is the key. Through an online account it is
possible to select from a range of our services and easily manage
your shipments. So we can offer you the friendly prices in comparison
to services of logistic companies. </span></p><p><span><strong><span>Are
you a licensed postal service? </span></strong><br/>Yes,
we
have a postal licence. Therefore, we can officially carry your mail
and packages. </span></p><p><span><strong><span>How
can I use Mailbox Germany as my second mailbox? </span></strong>You
can redirect your mailings to our address using the redirection
service of Deutsche Post.

Unsere IdeeViele
 Menschen im Ausland würden gerne Waren bei deutschen Händlern bestellen
 und können das auch. Aber viele Händler liefern ausschließlich im 
Inland. Die gleiche Erfahrung machen auch viele Deutsche, die sich zum 
Beispiel als Arbeitnehmer, Rentner, Studenten oder Soldaten dauerhaft im
 Ausland befinden. Sie kommen außerdem nicht mehr ohne Weiteres an ihre 
Post.  
 
Mit
 unserer Idee schaffen wir es ganz einfach diese Hürde zu überwinden: 
All unsere Kunden erhalten bei uns einen Lagerplatz und dazu eine deutsche Lieferadresse,
 an die sie Pakete, Briefe und Zeitschriften zu Inlandskonditionen 
liefern lassen können. Einmal hier angekommen kann dann jeder in seinem 
Kundenaccount bestimmen, wann seine Sendungen an seine Heimatadresse 
geschickt werden sollen und ob das einzeln passiert oder mehrere in ein 
großes Paket umgepackt werden sollen. Die gewünschten Waren oder die 
eigene Post sind dann nur noch einen Zwischenschritt weit entfernt.

  Und
 die Möglichkeiten sind sogar noch vielfältiger: Wir können 
Briefpost auch scannen und praktisch ohne Zeitverzögerung elektronisch 
zur Verfügung stellen. Das ist ideal für alle, die sich beim Work and 
Travel treiben lassen oder zwischen verschiedenen Standorten im Ausland 
pendeln müssen. Flexible und breit gefächerte Tarifoptionen ermöglichen 
es dabei jedem eine maßgeschneiderte Mailbox für seine ganz 
individuellen Bedürfnisse zu gestalten. 

 
Garantiert
 finden unsere Kunden überall auf dem Globus noch andere Wege Mailbox 
Germany zu nutzen. Doch damit es losgehen kann, brauchen wir erst mal 
noch deine Hilfe.Was ist besonders an dieser Idee?
Kunden aus dem Ausland können mit Mailbox Germany bei Händlern Kaufen, die keinen Versand ins Ausland bieten. (z.B. bei Otto, Tchibo oder SportScheck)

Preisvorteile, durch preiswerte Versandtarife und juristische Absicherungen für Kunden und Händler, da deutsche Gesetzesvorgaben für den Einkauf gelten.

man in einem fremden Land wenn das eigene Auto kaputt geht? Paul,
einem Freund ist genau das in Brasilien passiert.
Unterwegs auf einer Reise durch Lateinamerika hatte er seinen BMW
Mini von Streetart-Künstlern gestalten lassen. Dann brach ihm nach
20.000 Kilometern die Kupplung.
In einer
Werkstatt sagte man ihm, die Kupplung koste 2.000$ und die Lieferzeit
sei ungewiss. Darauf wollte sich Paul nicht einlassen. Aber sein Auto
zurückzulassen kam für ihn nicht in Frage. Glücklicherweise gab es
Rettung. In einem deutschen Online Shop hatte er eine Kupplung für
185€ gefunden, doch der Händler wollte nicht außerhalb
Deutschlands liefern. So rief er bei uns an und fragte ob wir die
Kupplung für ihn entgegennehmen und nach Brasilien schicken.Logo,
antworteten wir.Denn mit unserem Onlinehandel Vireo.de verfügen wir über das Know How international zu versenden. So
 sparte Paul eine Menge Geld und Zeit. Und der Mini - steht heute als 
Kunstobjekt im BMW Museum in München. Und aus der Idee ""Sendungen 
weiterzuleiten"" entstand unsere Start-Up-Idee. Wie grenzenloser Versand Leben retten kann
Immer wieder erschüttern Produktskandale das Vertrauen der Kunden
in unterschiedlichen Regionen der Welt. Dies weckt bei den
betroffenen oft den Wunsch nach einer alternativen Bezugsquelle. 2008
erschütterte China ein Bericht über verbotene Chemikalien im
Milchpulver. Sechs Babys starben und mindestens 300.000 Kleinkinder
kamen mit Nierensteinen ins Krankenhaus. Seitdem decken viele
Chinesen unter anderem mit deutsche Milchpulver ihren Bedarf.
Austauschstudenten und Touristen versorgen die Bekannten und Freunde
im Heimatland. Doch auch Chinesen die keine Bekannten oder Freunde in
Europa haben würden gerne in Deutschland bestellen. Doch die
Hersteller reagieren mit einer Regulierung des Versands.
Mit Mailbox Germany möchten wir daher einen Service aufbauen der es
Ausländern ermöglicht Bestellungen zu tätigen als wären sie in
Deutschland. Denn Kunden sind mittlerweile global auf der Suche wenn
heimische Anbieter nicht bereit sind auf ihre Bedürfnisse
einzugehen.Warum kompliziert, wenn es auch einfach geht?
Im Geschäftsleben kommt es häufig vor, dass man mehr mitnehmen
will als man im Flugzeug Reisegepäck haben darf. Also verschickt man
den Rest per Paket an den Zielort.

Ganz einfach? 

Der Teufel steckt im Detail: Will man die Ware unbesehen zum Kunden
schicken? Nimmt das Hotel das Paket richtig entgegen? Wann muss das
Paket abgegeben werden damit es rechtzeitig da ist? Muss ich für
einfache Sendungen gleich in Verhandlung mit Logistikkonzernen gehen?

Ein Unternehmer meinte im Gespräch er wünsche sich eine Firma, die
ihm seine Sendung für ein paar Tage einlagert. Er würde dann voraus
fliegen und die Ware im Hotel persönlich entgegennehmen.

Prima, meinten wir, denn mit Mailbox Germany bieten wir einen
Weiterleitungsservice der Pakete und Briefe in Deutschland annimmt
und von dort in alle Welt verschickt. Wann und wohin die Sendung
geschickt werden soll können unsere Kunden einfach und transparent,
online entscheiden. Wir erledigen die Zollerklärung und suchen den
besten Transporttarif für sie. Auf unserer Webseite können
eingeloggte Kunden dann Warensendungen beauftragen und werden über
Kosten und Versanddauer informiert. Mit unserem Tracking-Tool können
sie die Sendung auch gleich auf unserer Webseite verfolgen.Schweizer kaufen vor dem Release das iPhone 5 in DeutschlandKeine

Warum lasse ich mir die Ware nicht vom Onlineshop direkt ins Ausland
schicken? 
50% der Onlineshops in Deutschland versenden nicht aktiv ins Ausland, so
kann es passieren, dass du wichtige Waren nicht bekommst. 
Welche Sparte nutzt Mailbox Germany? 
Mailbox Germany agiert im Small Parcel Bereich bis 40kg. Darüber hinaus
agieren internationale Logistikfirmen und Speditionen. 
Versendet ihr die Waren selbst? 
Nein, wir versenden ausschließlich mit etablierten, internationalen
Dienstleistern, wie DHL, DPD oder UPS. 
Müsst ihr meine Pakete kontrollieren? 
Um die Ausfuhr beim Zollamt anzumelden müssen wir gegebenenfalls in dein
Paket schauen. Den Inhalt von Briefen lassen wir jedoch unangetastet. 
Wie verwalte ich meine Briefe und Pakete? 
Das Onlinemanagement ist der Schlüssel. Unser Login-Bereich macht es dir
möglich unsere vielen verschiedenen Services zu buchen und deine Sendungen
einfach zu verwalten. Durch dieses elektronische System können wir dir im
Vergleich zu Logistikfirmen gute und günstige Preise bieten. 
Seid ihr ein zugelassener Postdienst?  
Wir haben bereits eine Postlizenz und dürfen damit deine Post und Pakete
offiziell befördern.  
Wie kann ich Mailbox Germany als zweiten Briefkasten nutzen?

Du kannst über den Nachsendeservice der deutschen Post deinen Briefkasten
praktisch zu uns umziehen lassen.

Vielen Dank für deine Aufmerksamkeit und deine Unterstützung, sei ganz am Anfang dieser Idee dabei und hilf uns Produkte, Geschenke und Post in alle Welt zu senden.Euer Mailbox-Germany-TeamEnglish version

Our
idea 

Many
people abroad like to order goods from Germany and actually can do
that. But most of the traders deliver only domestically. The same
thing is experienced by lot of Germans, who are permanently located
abroad, for example, expatriates, pensioners or soldiers. Moreover,
they can not automatically collect their mail. 

Our
idea is to overcome this obstacle quite easy: each of our customers
gets some storage place and a
German
delivery address,
where they can send packages,
letters and magazines
at the domestic rates. Everyone can check their account, see when the
package has been received here and choose whether to forward it
directly to his home or to combine several shipments into a bigger
one. Then, the desired goods or mails are only one step away. 


  But
there are even more possibilities: we can also scan the mail and
provide it online with no time delays. This is perfect for people,
who move between different locations due to their work or traveling.
Flexible and diversified tariff options allow everyone to customize
the mailbox for his individual needs. 

In
order to be ready to go, we still need your
help.What is
special about this idea?Customers
from abroad can buy at German online retailers that do not offer international
shipping (e.g. Otto, Tchibo or SportScheck)Price advantages
through low shipping costs and legal safeguard for customers and retailers are
ensured since German country-specific legal requirements apply A

following services:
Temporary storage and consolidation- Put several
orders into one package and save money!
Reception and forwarding abroad. We send you your
package to any country!

management!

of cost and performance- easy tariff overview

Cargo Center in Leipzig as well as to other depot locations (UPS, TNT, DPD, Hermes,
GLS) in Central Germany.  You still have questions?In
our FAQ section
you find a comprehensive summary of questions and answers to the following
subjects:Customs and regulations, faulty deliveries, returns, etc.To
find out more about our services go to Prices and Services.
Cross-border shopping - Three example, how we came up with our idea
Mailbox Germany
takes Mini Cooper to BWM-MuseumWhat exactly do you do when your car breaks down in a foreign country?
Exactly this happened to my friend Paul in Brazil. On his journey throughout
South America he had his Mini Cooper designed by street artists. After about
12.000 miles his clutch broke.At the dealership he was told that repair costs would amount to $2.000
and that the delivery period would be uncertain. Paul would not let himself get
into this. But leaving his car behind was out of the question. Fortunately,
help was at hand. By searching the internet, he found a clutch for €185 on a website of a German online shop. But the
trader was not willing to deliver outside Germany. That is when Paul called us
to ask if we could take delivery of his clutch and send it to Brazil.Absolutely! Thanks to our online shop Vireo.de we have aquired practical knowledge concerning international shipping.
 Paul was able to save a great amount of money and time. And the Mini- 
is today an object of art and part of the permanent exhibition in the 
BMW Museum in Munich. This is one of the events that brought up the 
startup idea of delivery forwarding. How shipping across borders
can save lives All around the world product scandals shatter consumer trust again and
again. People concerned often wish having the choice of an
alternative supplier. In 2008 people in China were terrified by the news and
events of prohibited chemicals that were found in powdered milk.  Six
babies died and at least 300.000 small children with kidney stones had to be
treated in hospitals. Ever since, many Chinese stock up on German powdered milk among other
things. Exchange students and tourists supply their family and friends back home.
But those who do not have relatives or friends in Europe would also like to buy
in Germany. However, manufacturers react with shipping regulations. 
With Mailbox Germany we intend to set up a service that offers people residing
outside Germany the opportunity to buy and order products as if they were
living here. Today, people are searching globally for products that their domestic
market does not provide.
In business it often happens that one would like to
take more baggage along than actually authorized by the airlines. Consequently,
the rest is being shipped in a package to its destination. 

Is it really that easy? 
The devil is in the detail: Should one really ship goods without prior
inspection to the customer? Will the hotel accept the delivery properly? When
does the package have to be delivered in order to arrive in time? Do I immediately
have to enter into negotiations with haulage companies for a simple shipment? 
There was a businessman who expressed the wish that there was a company
that could stock his delivery for a few days until he gets to the hotel to receive
the goods personally.Great! That was our first thought since with Mailbox Germany we provide a
forwarding service thanks to which we will receive packages and letters in
Germany and send them across the globe. When and where you want your items to
be shipped lies exclusively in your hands. Our customers can control all
processes easily and transparently online. We deal with the customs declaration
and find the best transport tariff for you. On our website customers can log
into their user account to request shipping of their goods and will be
informed about delivery charges and delivery time. Using the tracking tool on
our website you can check on the delivery status of your items at any time.Swiss people purchase iPhone 5 before release dateNo delivery date for the iPhone 5 in Switzerland!

 solar panel (USB, 12W) worth over 150 € from our mail order store 
Vireo.de.Professional Mailbox Package - 250€You'll get our subscription Professional for one year for free and
 a credit on out service fees worth 100€. Additionally you will get a 
surprise package with typical german Products.The Special One - 500€We invite you (+1) for 2 days to Merseburg. You live in a 
beautiful mansion near the Merseburg Castle (location of The Monuments 
Men). In addition, we invite you to a seasonal cultural event and a 
guided tour through our company.FAQWhy
do they not send my packages directly abroad?
50%
of online shops in Germany do not actively send abroad, therefore it
may happen that you do not get important goods. Which
area does Mailbox Germany operate in? Germany
acts in the Small Parcel Area up to 40kg. For shipments bigger than
that other international logistics companies and freight forwarders
are better suited. Do
you ship the goods by yourself? No,
we ship only with established, international service providers, such
as DHL, DPD or UPS. Are
you going to check my package? If
it will be necessary,  we will check the content of the package
in order to have it registered at the custom office. However, the
letters are not going to be controlled. How
can I manage my mail and packages? The
online management is the key. Through an online account it is
possible to select from a range of our services and easily manage
your shipments. So we can offer you the friendly prices in comparison
to services of logistic companies. Are
you a licensed postal service? Yes,
we
have a postal licence. Therefore, we can officially carry your mail
and packages. How
can I use Mailbox Germany as my second mailbox? You
can redirect your mailings to our address using the redirection
service of Deutsche Post.

Unfortuantely, through the deprivation of disease and a flawed attempt to grant land ownership the land transferred from the hands of the Native population to a few land owners who held vast tracks of land that they used to produce sugar. Without access to land and water rights the people of Hawaii were unable to sustain themselves in the ways that they had done for centuries. Thus began an era that has lasted to the modern day in which over 90% of all the food consumed in Hawaii is shipped in by either air or barge from the mainland US or other countries. </div><div>Hawaii still has the ability to produce massive amounts of produce, yet most of the land is unused. In ancient times on the windward side of the islands large and complicated irrigation systems for taro were constructed called lois, which could produce massive amounts of food from both the taro plant and the fish that lived in the water. While ACCESS does not have the land necessary to create loi we can simulate a substitute that will be as functional using modern materials.</div><div>Aquaponics:</div><div>Aquaponics, based primarily on practices employed by ancient Aztec civilizations is a system amazingly similar to the ancient Kanaka food production systems. With minimal materials and training we could instruct our boarders to grow many staple foods (i.e., Taro, potatoes, sweet potatoes, kale, lettuce, celery, chives, strawberries, corn, cucumbers, etc.) many of which are not often found in traditional aquaponic systems but can be easily managed through the use of specialized containers. This food could not only help feed our population, but could also be a source of barter and income at local farmer's markets. The system would also create a steady source of protein in the form of tilapia. </div><div>The system we are proposing would be fairly large, containing up to 100 lbs of fish and having 100 square feet of growing space. It could potentially provide for all the green needs of the boarders of the Keaau houses. </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>ACCESS would not only like to teach our residents how to lead clean and 
sober lives, but to also be more self sufficient overall. To this end we
 would like to show them how to create, maintain, and thrive an 
aquaponic system. Kanaka 'Oiwi (Native Hawaiians) used aquaponic systems
 for almost two thousand years prior to Western contact in the form of 
Loi, or taro patches. With this form of massive food production they 
were able to support an extreme population, some estimates put it over 
one million people prior to contact with Western disease. The aquaponic 
system we propose is simple in design, maintenance, and use. The 
materials are readily available, if not somewhat expensive. <br/>The 
systems we would like to build would be somewhat portable and easily 
replicated. Using food safe water barrels and troughs lined with food 
safe liner we would create an ebb and flow system in the ample yard 
space of the grounds of the current residential house in Keaau. With 
this expandable system we would be able to grow lettuce, chard, spinach,
 basil, and other green leafy vegetables in both the cinder beds and on 
floating platforms. Two large tanks would both grow and breed tilapia 
fish for consumption as well. Using other specially designed pots we 
could also grow sweet potato, corn, broccoli, cauliflower, cucumbers, 
tomatoes, and other staple crops. <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>The idea would be to supplement 
the food stores of the house, teach the residents to grow, harvest, can 
and sell/trade their crop, as well as to create and maintain the system.
 Additionally we would be able to offer our residents fresh healthy 
vegetables that did not use any pesticides, herbicides, or non-organic 
fertilizers. <br/>The investment we would receive for this project would 
go to pay for the materials for the system, the initial design and 
building of the system, maintenance, seeds and fish, fish food, and 
canning materials. <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Costs and Materials</h3> <p>The initial cost of a simple system are minimal. This project would be a more advanced system. There are several materials that are necessary for such a system and part of the set up costs:</p>

and their families for years to come. <br/>Mahalo Nui Loa</p></div>","Aloha ACCESS Capabilities recently opened a supported sober living house on the east side of the Big Island. Unfortunately due to issues surrounding the changing face of the health insurance industry we have not recouped our investment as quickly as we had hoped and were not able to implement all the plans we initially had. One of those plans was to teach food self sufficiency to the boarders at our homes.  While this would be a minimal initial investment we can not find the means to engage these plans at this time and are seeking help from our island community and beyond the islands. This would not only benefit the program in the short run, but be a viable and ongoing source of nutrition, education, and income and training opportunities for the boarders at our homes in Keaau. An extremely brief history of Hawaii's agriculture:Prior to the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom the islands of Hawaii were an agricultural marvel. From the mountains to the sea nearly every patch of land was cultivated to produce something of value and use to the Kanka 'Oiwi, the native people of these islands.

<b>Short
Summary</b></p>
<p>
The <b>CasaShanti
Community Wellness Project</b> is passionate about providing
community programs to all people from all walks of life. We have
found a new location which will allow EVERYONE to enjoy the rewards
and reap the benefits of the services and programs on offer at
CasaShanti, which focus on <b>holistic wellness and
a non-theological meditative practice</b> right in the
heart of downtown Fort Myers, Florida. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
	CasaShanti
	has been making a difference in the Ft Myers community since 2009. 
	As <b>an open platform free from doctrine, dogma or obligation</b>,
	it is a place for the exchange of  knowledge, where peace and
	communal dialog assist the further expansion of the human mind, body
	and soul. Its very existence is to serve the community by offering
	proven life management tools from a holistic perspective in the
	areas of <b>physical, emotional, spiritual fitness and
	well-being</b>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	We
	have now officially outgrown our current location and need your
	support to expand.  We will be adding many new classes and
	teachings in the coming year, including <b>English as a Second
	Language (ESL)</b> and Beginners Spanish courses. We are also
	in conversations with licensed <b>Therapists, Counselors and
	Massage Therapists</b> to join our staff, so we need a larger
	space, accessible to everyone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	Zachari
	VanDyne, CasaShanti founder, took spiritual refuge in the north of
	India for many years in the company of Buddhist Lamas, spiritual
	teachers and healers where he learned, first and foremost, to <b>be
	of service</b>. He brought his wealth of experience and knowledge to
	bear in his childhood home of Ft Myers and has since provided a
	space that hosts weekly meditation, yoga classes, energetic
	healings, grief and spiritual counseling, and wellness seminars. A
	new, easily accessible location will offer the opportunity to expand
	the community served AND the services offered. CasaShanti offers a
	refuge from the pressures of everyday life, providing a safe space
	to learn more about your personal journey. The CasaShanti community
	has grown exponentially over the last five years and needs more
	space.  A new, larger and more convenient location has been
	found that meets current handicap accessibility requirements. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>
<b>We
need $17,000 and here is where it’s going:</b></p>
<p>
The
new CasaShanti will be located on Cottage St between MLK and Victoria
Ave in downtown Ft Myers. The commercial space has been previously
used as a lawyers' office and meets the <b>ADA accessibility
requirements</b>. The current overall condition is adequate, however,
updates are needed. Below is the general breakdown of requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
	Administration
	(licenses, permits, liability insurance, etc) : $4900</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>

</li>
</ul><p>
The
above subsets contain specific budgeting details and are
appropriately prioritized. If our funding goal is not met all monies
raised will be distributed according to this prioritization.
CasaShanti is already five years strong and will continue to grow.
Any and all funds will be used exclusively for the development and
promotion of the CasaShanti Community Wellness Project.</p>
<p>
<b>The
Impact - How your contribution will make a difference:</b></p>
<p>
We
all know why centers like CasaShanti are needed. Just turn on the
news (or look in the mirror). We are a society burdened with ever
mounting pressures and struggles, senseless crimes, rage, violence,
and anger. The collective life force pushes forward to ensure
our survival while cultural fears of change and new
understanding pulls back thus tearing at our individual emotional and
moral fabric. In the negotiation of that tear is found <b>our
ever-surging personal transformation. </b></p>
<p>
 Our
contemporary culture has seen enough Oprah and Dr. Phil, we've
heard all the studies and reasons. The practice of <b>meditation
has permeated our pop culture</b> and
has been recognized by the most conservative journals and scholars as
beneficial for multiple life realities such as stress, depression and
addiction to name only three. We <i>know
 </i>lots
of things to help us build a stronger sense of self and
community. What many are lacking is a place to go without
doctrine or obligation to just gather and be, to meet like-minded
friends and to foster a sense of <b>confidence
and clarity</b>. 
CasaShanti is just that place. </p>
<p>
CasaShanti
will take our western culture's notion of meditation and holistic
wellness practices off its sometimes-idealized pedestal of
exclusivity and bring it our friends and neighbors, the marginalized
and the disenfranchised. There is no one answer or certificate. This
isn't about a class, philosophy or religion. The intent is to assist
the community in creating daily practices that <b>recognize the
fire of life and give it the fuel to burn brightly and with intent.</b></p>
<p>
<b>Risks
&amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>
The
most significant challenge to CasaShanti's professional space and
presence is financial sustainability. The money we are campaigning
for here is to get in, get set up and promote. Long-range plans call
for grant funding based on our dedication to community service and a
pending 501(c)(3) non-profit status from the IRS. In the mean time,
how will CasaShanti pay its bills?</p>
<p>
CasaShanti
doesn't need a lot to operate. To keep the doors open to the
community, $1500 will need to be generated monthly. CasaShanti
already generates this amount for its current services offered. By
expanding our reach and ability, offering more classes and seminars,
including a membership plan and our new language courses, we are
confident in our ability to not only continue  CasaShanti's
work, but also to increase its breadth and scope.  </p>

understanding pulls back thus tearing at our individual emotional and
moral fabric. In the negotiation of that tear is found our
ever-surging personal transformation. 

 Our
contemporary culture has seen enough Oprah and Dr. Phil, we've
heard all the studies and reasons. The practice of meditation
has permeated our pop culture and
has been recognized by the most conservative journals and scholars as
beneficial for multiple life realities such as stress, depression and
addiction to name only three. We know
 lots
of things to help us build a stronger sense of self and
community. What many are lacking is a place to go without
doctrine or obligation to just gather and be, to meet like-minded
friends and to foster a sense of confidence
and clarity. 
CasaShanti is just that place. 

CasaShanti
will take our western culture's notion of meditation and holistic
wellness practices off its sometimes-idealized pedestal of
exclusivity and bring it our friends and neighbors, the marginalized
and the disenfranchised. There is no one answer or certificate. This
isn't about a class, philosophy or religion. The intent is to assist
the community in creating daily practices that recognize the
fire of life and give it the fuel to burn brightly and with intent.

Risks
& Challenges

The
most significant challenge to CasaShanti's professional space and
presence is financial sustainability. The money we are campaigning
for here is to get in, get set up and promote. Long-range plans call
for grant funding based on our dedication to community service and a
pending 501(c)(3) non-profit status from the IRS. In the mean time,
how will CasaShanti pay its bills?

CasaShanti
doesn't need a lot to operate. To keep the doors open to the
community, $1500 will need to be generated monthly. CasaShanti
already generates this amount for its current services offered. By
expanding our reach and ability, offering more classes and seminars,
including a membership plan and our new language courses, we are
confident in our ability to not only continue  CasaShanti's
work, but also to increase its breadth and scope.

	We
	at CasaShanti are grateful for any act of support.

	are included in our budget, maybe you have just one thing we need

	If you're local to the southwest Florida region, maybe you have a
	service we need, such as graphic support, web design,
	furniture, supplies, construction man power (we'll be refinishing
	100 year-old heart of pine wooden floors, would love a great quote
	from a local professional). In any case, we encourage you to reach
	out to us and let us know of your interest. Our purpose is
	defined by the community, and we need the community's support,
	belief and encouragement.

<h2>
<a name=""Top"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Festival Redhead Days</h2>
<p class=""normal"">Each year, during the first weekend of September, something magical happens. A huge crowd of redheads and their family, friends &amp; admirers descend upon the city of Breda in the Netherlands. During this weekend, redheads stand out by their number as several thousand redheads from over 70 countries are joining together in one place.<br/><br/> The festival offers more than 50 activities: lectures about the origin of red hair, professional photo shoots of you, a fashion show with redheaded mannequins, a pub crawl, music, dance, sports and much more. All activities are free and open to everyone. It is a weekend full of fun for redheads and their fans. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""1,250 redheads celebrate one teenage girl's birthday"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v481/chantal1978/Redhead%20Days/204339_3669106338539_1024367417_o.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Happy birthday to you...!""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p class=""normal"">We need your help. Many of you tell us that the festival makes lots of people happy and proud; it is a place to meet old and new friends. Each year more people attend the event and each year it gets bigger and better. But now, unfortunately, the continuation of the event is endangered due to finances. Last year, there was a shortage of a serious amount of money, which had to be settled by the event founder, Bart, personally. He cannot do that again and as such, additional funding is very much needed.</p>
<p class=""normal"">That’s why we hope for your support! Every cent we raise with this campaign will be used directly in favour of the event. All organizers are volunteers and work on the event in their spare time.</p>
<p class=""normal"">Of course you will get something in return, besides our gratitude and a great festival. We have some awesome perks to choose from, even for a single dollar. Shipping costs are included, which makes it easier for you. But please do not order the elephant if you live in Australia!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Perks: what do you get?</h3>
<p><em>*Please note that the images are a representation of the perks, and that the final product may look slightly different.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""normal""><strong>Smile!</strong><br/> For just one dollar you will get the digital group photo of 2013, depicting more than a thousand redheads. In high resolution! If you visit the event, for sure you are in it. But be aware, it might take some time to figure out where you are at the photo since everybody has red hair!</p>
<p class=""normal""><strong>Silicones are forever</strong><br/> Start your collection of exclusive Redhead Days wristbands now! These silicone wrist bands will be available for a short time: now. It'll be in this year's theme colour so when you wear it at the future Redhead Days, you can show everyone which editions of the event you attended, simply by wearing the wristbands of those years! </p>
<p class=""normal""><img alt=""wristband"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v481/chantal1978/ea44cdff-5135-47fa-be24-d1080d484ddc_zps75e27d64.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle; margin: 3px;""/></p>
<p class=""normal""><strong>Sponsor lunch: picnic in the park</strong><br/> An epic picnic in the park (rug or picnic table will be provided). Join hundreds of sponsoring redheads and fans in this outdoor lunch.</p>
<p class=""normal""><img alt=""picnic"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v481/chantal1978/family-picnic_zps84ef0bcb.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 3px; vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
<p class=""normal""><strong>T-shirt</strong><br/> Prior to the event you will receive a T-shirt, so you will be dressed in a fashionable T-shirt with the right colour during the festival. We'll email you after the campaign, to ask which size you need.</p>
<p class=""normal""><img alt=""t-shirt"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v481/chantal1978/RHDMerchandise0311blauw_zps8dde3811.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle; margin: 3px;""/></p>
<p class=""normal""><strong>THE Book</strong><br/> This is the book that we’ve been planning to make for the last five years, and this year it can be yours. The Redhead Days book contains the group photos from all previous Redhead Days, as well as new photos from the 2013 edition. But there is so much more: artwork, things you didn’t know about the festival, things no one knows about our future plans for the 10th anniversary festival in 2015. And many, many things about red hair. Pre-ordering the book during this campaign will be cheaper than ordering it later.</p>
<p class=""normal""><img alt=""the book"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v481/chantal1978/schets_boek_zps0c851f17.jpeg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle; margin: 3px;""/></p>
<p class=""normal""><strong>In the spotlight 1</strong><br/> Be a model for our festival posters. These posters will be spread across the Breda region and they are huge (A0 size)! Of course, you'll also receive some (10) copies of your poster for you and your friends.</p>
<p class=""normal"">OR</p>
<p class=""normal""><strong>In the spotlight 2</strong><br/> This perk will launch you into redhead heaven, as you and your camera will join Bart on his crane platform during the big photo shoot on Sunday. Many have pleaded for this chance... now it is yours!</p>
<p class=""normal""><strong>The royal treatment</strong><br/> Be a V.I.P. during the entire Redhead Days weekend. An organisation member will personally pick you up at the airport or any other location within the Netherlands, and accompany you to Breda where you will stay at the best hotel (included). During the event, you'll dine with the organisers. Of course we will also accompany you on your way back home (at least to the airport) and you can take your pick from the perks mentioned above.</p>
<p class=""normal""><strong>Be a-muse-d</strong></p>
<p class=""normal"">You (or your loved one) is going to be immortalised on a large painting by Bart, the founder of the Redhead Days. And after that, it will be on your wall. And if you like, it will be part of the exhibition on the 2014 Redhead Days.</p>
<p class=""normal"">Picture yourself entering the big church of Breda, glancing over the artwork, and suddenly realising all visitors of the exhibition seem to recognise you. And as the crowd steps back, you see yourself in a life-size painting…</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>How about becoming a volunteer for the event? Help out with the preparations, or during the event, or both. There are lots of possibilities and for sure it will be fun!</li>
<li>Please use Indiegogo's share tools to help us spread the word.</li>
<li>Last but not least: if you agree with us that the event is important, and if you happen to own a company or if you are a philanthropist, please contact us directly. We might have some suggestions for you to make a difference for the Redhead Days and we are also curious to hear about your ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Redheaded dogs are welcome too!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v481/chantal1978/Redhead%20Days/339745_3669212301188_2055418437_o.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle; margin: 3px;"" title=""Ginger dog""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3 class=""normal""><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p class=""normal"">The Redhead Days is a lot of fun, but for many of us it is more than ‘just’ fun. The large numbers of both local and foreign guests, many of which from outside of Europe, prove that the event has a large impact on its visitors.<br/><br/> Many of you say that being with so many likeminded people and meeting so many people with the same background is refreshing. Many friendships have been formed. And the lectures, workshops, exhibitions, photo shoots, fashion shows etcetera; all provide interesting experiences. But most of all, you will immerse yourself in a crowd of fellow redheads who are truly proud of having red hair.</p>
<p>What is your motivation (to travel half way around the globe) to join the festival? </p>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<p class=""normal"">We want to make this campaign as exciting as a horse race with a ginger horse in the lead ;-)</p>
<p class=""normal""><img alt=""red horse winning"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v481/chantal1978/RedCadeaux_2872155_zps8dbe9f5c.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle; margin: 3px;""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""normal"">So, we've made a list of finish lines. For instance: if we reach $ 10,000, Scott (the maker of Being Ginger - the film) will shave off his hair and beard after the campaign finishes. If you don't want to rob him of his hair, then make sure we reach $ 20,000 so he's off the hook.</p>

<a name=""Nederlands"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Festival Redhead Days</h2>
<p dir=""ltr"">Ieder eerste weekend van september gebeurt er iets magisch: Een enorm aantal roodharigen en hun familie en vrienden strijken neer in het Nederlandse stadje Breda. Tijdens dit weekend vallen de roodharigen op door hun aantallen; duizenden roodharigen uit maar liefst 70! landen komen op één plaats samen.</p>
<p>Het festival biedt meer dan 50 activiteiten: lezingen over de geschiedenis van rood haar, professionele fotosessies met jou voor de camera, een modeshow met roodharige modellen, een kroegentocht, muziek, dans, sport en nog veel meer. Alle activiteiten zijn gratis en vrij toegankelijk voor iedereen. Het is een weekend barstensvol plezier en herkenning voor roodharigen en hun fans.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Ik zie rode mensen!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v481/chantal1978/Redhead%20Days/328048_3669102698448_1094592401_o.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle; margin: 3px;"" title=""Grote fotoshoot 2012""/></p>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Wat wij nodig hebben &amp; wat jij krijgt</h3>
<p class=""normal"">Wij hebben jouw hulp nodig, vandaar deze campagne. We horen  dat het evenement jullie trots en gelukkig maakt; het is een plek om oude en nieuwe vrienden te ontmoeten. Elk jaar komen er meer mensen naar het evenement en elk jaar wordt het groter en beter.</p>
<p class=""normal"">Maar nu wordt het voorbestaan van het evenement helaas bedreigd door financien, of eerder het gebrek daar aan. Vorig jaar was er een groot tekort dat door de oprichter van het evenement, Bart, persoonlijk moest worden bijgepast. Hij kan dat niet nog een keer doen en dus zijn aanvullende inkomsten heel hard nodig.</p>
<p class=""normal"">Dat is waarom we hopen op jouw steun! Elke cent die we ophalen met deze campagne wordt direct in het evenement geïnvesteerd. Alle organisatoren zijn vrijwilligers die het werk voor de Redhead Days in hun vrije tijd doen.</p>
<p class=""normal"">Natuurlijk krijg je er iets voor terug, naast onze dankbaarheid en een geweldig festival. We hebben een aantal gave ‘perks’ waar je uit kunt kiezen, zelfs al voor een enkele dollar. Verzendkosten zijn inbegrepen, wat het voor jou makkelijker maakt. Maar bestel alsjeblieft niet de olifant als je in Australië woont! </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 class=""normal""><strong>Perks: wat krijg je?</strong></h3>
<p><em>* Let op, de getoonde afbeeldingen vertegenwoordigen de perks, maar het uiteindelijke product kan iets afwijken.</em></p>
<p class=""normal""><strong>Lach! (Smile!)</strong><br/> Voor slechts 1 dollar krijg je een digitaal exemplaar van de groepsfoto van 2013, waar meer dan duizend roodharigen op afgebeeld staan. In een hoge resolutie! Als je het evenement bezoekt, sta je er zeker op! Maar hou er rekening mee dat het even zoeken kan zijn waar jij staat, aangezien iedereen rood haar heeft!</p>
<p class=""normal""><strong>Siliconen voor altijd (Silicones are forever)</strong><br/> Begin nu je verzameling exclusieve Redhead Days armbandjes! Deze diliconen armbandjes zullen maar korte tijd te koop zijn: vanaf nu. Wacht dus niet, maar sla nu je slag! Het bandje heeft de kleur die past bij het thema van dit jaar, dus als je het op de toekomstige Redhead Days ook draagt, kan iedereen meteen zien naar welke edities je bent geweest. Zo kun je leuk met anderen vergelijken wie wanneer is geweest!</p>
<p class=""normal""><img alt=""armbandje"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v481/chantal1978/ea44cdff-5135-47fa-be24-d1080d484ddc_zps75e27d64.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle; margin: 3px;""/></p>
<p class=""normal""><strong>Sponsor picnic/lunch</strong><br/> Een epische picknick in het park (kleedje of tafel wordt verzorgd). Voeg je bij honderden roodharige sponsors voor deze lunch in de buitenlucht.</p>
<p class=""normal""><img alt=""picnic"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v481/chantal1978/family-picnic_zps84ef0bcb.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 3px;""/></p>
<p class=""normal""><strong>T-shirt</strong><br/> Voorafgaand aan het evenement ontvang je een T-shirt, zodat je tijdens het evenement gekleed gaat in een hip T-shirt in de kleur van het festival. Na de campagne krijg je een mail waarin we vragen welke maat je wilt hebben.</p>
<p class=""normal""><img alt=""t-shirt"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v481/chantal1978/RHDMerchandise0311blauw_zps8dde3811.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle; margin: 3px;""/></p>
<p class=""normal""><strong>HET Boek (THE book)</strong><br/> Dit is het boek dat we al vijf jaar willen maken en dit jaar kan het van jou zijn. Het Redhead Days boek bevat alle groepsfoto’s van alle voorgaande Redhead Days en natuurlijk de nieuwe foto’s uit 2013. Maar er staat zoveel meer in: kunst, dingen die je niet wist over het evenement en dingen die nog niemand weet over de toekomstplannen voor het festival in 2015. En heel veel dingen over rood haar. Vooraf bestellen tijdens de campagne is goedkoper dan het later kopen.</p>
<p class=""normal""><img alt=""the book"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v481/chantal1978/schets_boek_zps0c851f17.jpeg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle; margin: 3px;""/></p>
<p class=""normal""><strong>Het middelpunt van de aandacht (In the spotlight)</strong><br/>1: Word een model voor onze festivalposters. Deze posters worden in Breda en omgeving verspreid en ze zijn gigantisch (A0 formaat)! Natuurlijk krijg je ook een aantal (10) exemplaren van jouw poster voor jezelf en je vrienden.</p>
<p class=""normal"">OF</p>
<p class=""normal""><strong>Het middelpunt van de aandacht (In the spotlight)</strong><br/>2: Met deze perk word je zo de roodharigen hemel in gelanceerd want jij en je camera gaan samen met Bart met een kraan de lucht in tijdens de grote fotosessie op zondag. Velen hebben gesmeekt om deze kans… Nu heb je hem!</p>
<p class=""normal""> </p>
<p class=""normal""><strong>De koning te rijk (The royal treatment)</strong><br/> Wees een V.I.P. tijdens het hele Redhead Days weekend. Een organisator van de Redhead Days haalt je op van het vliegveld of elke gewenste locatie in Nederland, waarna je naar Breda wordt gebracht. Daar verblijf je in het beste hotel (inbegrepen). Tijdens het evenement dineer je met de organisatie. Natuurlijk brengen we je ook weer terug (in elk geval naar het vliegveld) en je mag kiezen uit een van de bovenstaande perks.</p>
<p class=""normal""><strong>Wees gea-muse-erd (Be a-muse-d)</strong><br/> Jij (of iemand van wie je houdt) wordt vereeuwigd in een groot schilderij, gemaakt door Bart, de oprichter van de Redhead Days. En daarna hangt het aan jouw muur. En als je wilt, wordt het tentoongesteld tijdens de Redhead Days 2014 kunst tentoonstelling.</p>

<h3>De impact van de Redhead Days</h3>
<p class=""normal"">De Redhead Days zijn hartstikke leuk, maar voor velen van ons is het veel meer dan ‘alleen’ maar leuk. De enorme aantallen bezoekers uit zowel binnen- als buitenland, waarvan velen zelfs van buiten Europa, bewijzen dat het evenement in een behoefte voorziet en een enorme indruk achterlaat bij de bezoekers.</p>
<p class=""normal"">Velen van jullie geven aan dat omgeven zijn door zoveel mensen met een vergelijkbare achtergrond en vergelijkbare ervaringen, heel verfrissend is. Vele vriendschappen zijn hier gevormd door de jaren heen. <br/> De lezingen, workshops, tentoonstellingen, fotosessies, modeshow, enz., leveren stuk voor stuk bijzondere ervaringen op. Maar bovenal word je omgeven door een massa roodharigen die oprecht trots zijn op hun mooie rode haren.</p>
<p>Wat is jouw motivatie (om de halve wereld af te reizen) om naar het evenement te komen? </p>

<p class=""normal"">Daarom hebben we een lijst met finishes gemaakt. Bijvoorbeeld, als we $10,000 bereiken, scheert Scott (Harris, de maker van Being Ginger) na de campagne zijn haar en baard af.

Festival Redhead Days
Each year, during the first weekend of September, something magical happens. A huge crowd of redheads and their family, friends & admirers descend upon the city of Breda in the Netherlands. During this weekend, redheads stand out by their number as several thousand redheads from over 70 countries are joining together in one place. The festival offers more than 50 activities: lectures about the origin of red hair, professional photo shoots of you, a fashion show with redheaded mannequins, a pub crawl, music, dance, sports and much more. All activities are free and open to everyone. It is a weekend full of fun for redheads and their fans. 
 



 
What We Need & What You Get
We need your help. Many of you tell us that the festival makes lots of people happy and proud; it is a place to meet old and new friends. Each year more people attend the event and each year it gets bigger and better. But now, unfortunately, the continuation of the event is endangered due to finances. Last year, there was a shortage of a serious amount of money, which had to be settled by the event founder, Bart, personally. He cannot do that again and as such, additional funding is very much needed.
That’s why we hope for your support! Every cent we raise with this campaign will be used directly in favour of the event. All organizers are volunteers and work on the event in their spare time.
Of course you will get something in return, besides our gratitude and a great festival. We have some awesome perks to choose from, even for a single dollar. Shipping costs are included, which makes it easier for you. But please do not order the elephant if you live in Australia!
 


Perks: what do you get?
*Please note that the images are a representation of the perks, and that the final product may look slightly different.
 
Smile! For just one dollar you will get the digital group photo of 2013, depicting more than a thousand redheads. In high resolution! If you visit the event, for sure you are in it. But be aware, it might take some time to figure out where you are at the photo since everybody has red hair!
Silicones are forever Start your collection of exclusive Redhead Days wristbands now! These silicone wrist bands will be available for a short time: now. It'll be in this year's theme colour so when you wear it at the future Redhead Days, you can show everyone which editions of the event you attended, simply by wearing the wristbands of those years! 

Sponsor lunch: picnic in the park An epic picnic in the park (rug or picnic table will be provided). Join hundreds of sponsoring redheads and fans in this outdoor lunch.

T-shirt Prior to the event you will receive a T-shirt, so you will be dressed in a fashionable T-shirt with the right colour during the festival. We'll email you after the campaign, to ask which size you need.

THE Book This is the book that we’ve been planning to make for the last five years, and this year it can be yours. The Redhead Days book contains the group photos from all previous Redhead Days, as well as new photos from the 2013 edition. But there is so much more: artwork, things you didn’t know about the festival, things no one knows about our future plans for the 10th anniversary festival in 2015. And many, many things about red hair. Pre-ordering the book during this campaign will be cheaper than ordering it later.

In the spotlight 1 Be a model for our festival posters. These posters will be spread across the Breda region and they are huge (A0 size)! Of course, you'll also receive some (10) copies of your poster for you and your friends.
OR
In the spotlight 2 This perk will launch you into redhead heaven, as you and your camera will join Bart on his crane platform during the big photo shoot on Sunday. Many have pleaded for this chance... now it is yours!
The royal treatment Be a V.I.P. during the entire Redhead Days weekend. An organisation member will personally pick you up at the airport or any other location within the Netherlands, and accompany you to Breda where you will stay at the best hotel (included). During the event, you'll dine with the organisers. Of course we will also accompany you on your way back home (at least to the airport) and you can take your pick from the perks mentioned above.
Be a-muse-d
You (or your loved one) is going to be immortalised on a large painting by Bart, the founder of the Redhead Days. And after that, it will be on your wall. And if you like, it will be part of the exhibition on the 2014 Redhead Days.
Picture yourself entering the big church of Breda, glancing over the artwork, and suddenly realising all visitors of the exhibition seem to recognise you. And as the crowd steps back, you see yourself in a life-size painting…

 


Other Ways You Can Help

How about becoming a volunteer for the event? Help out with the preparations, or during the event, or both. There are lots of possibilities and for sure it will be fun!
Please use Indiegogo's share tools to help us spread the word.
Last but not least: if you agree with us that the event is important, and if you happen to own a company or if you are a philanthropist, please contact us directly. We might have some suggestions for you to make a difference for the Redhead Days and we are also curious to hear about your ideas.

 

 
The Impact
The Redhead Days is a lot of fun, but for many of us it is more than ‘just’ fun. The large numbers of both local and foreign guests, many of which from outside of Europe, prove that the event has a large impact on its visitors. Many of you say that being with so many likeminded people and meeting so many people with the same background is refreshing. Many friendships have been formed. And the lectures, workshops, exhibitions, photo shoots, fashion shows etcetera; all provide interesting experiences. But most of all, you will immerse yourself in a crowd of fellow redheads who are truly proud of having red hair.
What is your motivation (to travel half way around the globe) to join the festival? 
Goals
We want to make this campaign as exciting as a horse race with a ginger horse in the lead ;-)

 
So, we've made a list of finish lines. For instance: if we reach $ 10,000, Scott (the maker of Being Ginger - the film) will shave off his hair and beard after the campaign finishes. If you don't want to rob him of his hair, then make sure we reach $ 20,000 so he's off the hook.

Festival Redhead Days
Ieder eerste weekend van september gebeurt er iets magisch: Een enorm aantal roodharigen en hun familie en vrienden strijken neer in het Nederlandse stadje Breda. Tijdens dit weekend vallen de roodharigen op door hun aantallen; duizenden roodharigen uit maar liefst 70! landen komen op één plaats samen.
Het festival biedt meer dan 50 activiteiten: lezingen over de geschiedenis van rood haar, professionele fotosessies met jou voor de camera, een modeshow met roodharige modellen, een kroegentocht, muziek, dans, sport en nog veel meer. Alle activiteiten zijn gratis en vrij toegankelijk voor iedereen. Het is een weekend barstensvol plezier en herkenning voor roodharigen en hun fans.
 


 
Wat wij nodig hebben & wat jij krijgt
Wij hebben jouw hulp nodig, vandaar deze campagne. We horen  dat het evenement jullie trots en gelukkig maakt; het is een plek om oude en nieuwe vrienden te ontmoeten. Elk jaar komen er meer mensen naar het evenement en elk jaar wordt het groter en beter.
Maar nu wordt het voorbestaan van het evenement helaas bedreigd door financien, of eerder het gebrek daar aan. Vorig jaar was er een groot tekort dat door de oprichter van het evenement, Bart, persoonlijk moest worden bijgepast. Hij kan dat niet nog een keer doen en dus zijn aanvullende inkomsten heel hard nodig.
Dat is waarom we hopen op jouw steun! Elke cent die we ophalen met deze campagne wordt direct in het evenement geïnvesteerd. Alle organisatoren zijn vrijwilligers die het werk voor de Redhead Days in hun vrije tijd doen.
Natuurlijk krijg je er iets voor terug, naast onze dankbaarheid en een geweldig festival. We hebben een aantal gave ‘perks’ waar je uit kunt kiezen, zelfs al voor een enkele dollar. Verzendkosten zijn inbegrepen, wat het voor jou makkelijker maakt. Maar bestel alsjeblieft niet de olifant als je in Australië woont! 
 


Perks: wat krijg je?
* Let op, de getoonde afbeeldingen vertegenwoordigen de perks, maar het uiteindelijke product kan iets afwijken.
Lach! (Smile!) Voor slechts 1 dollar krijg je een digitaal exemplaar van de groepsfoto van 2013, waar meer dan duizend roodharigen op afgebeeld staan. In een hoge resolutie! Als je het evenement bezoekt, sta je er zeker op! Maar hou er rekening mee dat het even zoeken kan zijn waar jij staat, aangezien iedereen rood haar heeft!
Siliconen voor altijd (Silicones are forever) Begin nu je verzameling exclusieve Redhead Days armbandjes! Deze diliconen armbandjes zullen maar korte tijd te koop zijn: vanaf nu. Wacht dus niet, maar sla nu je slag! Het bandje heeft de kleur die past bij het thema van dit jaar, dus als je het op de toekomstige Redhead Days ook draagt, kan iedereen meteen zien naar welke edities je bent geweest. Zo kun je leuk met anderen vergelijken wie wanneer is geweest!

Sponsor picnic/lunch Een epische picknick in het park (kleedje of tafel wordt verzorgd). Voeg je bij honderden roodharige sponsors voor deze lunch in de buitenlucht.

T-shirt Voorafgaand aan het evenement ontvang je een T-shirt, zodat je tijdens het evenement gekleed gaat in een hip T-shirt in de kleur van het festival. Na de campagne krijg je een mail waarin we vragen welke maat je wilt hebben.

HET Boek (THE book) Dit is het boek dat we al vijf jaar willen maken en dit jaar kan het van jou zijn. Het Redhead Days boek bevat alle groepsfoto’s van alle voorgaande Redhead Days en natuurlijk de nieuwe foto’s uit 2013. Maar er staat zoveel meer in: kunst, dingen die je niet wist over het evenement en dingen die nog niemand weet over de toekomstplannen voor het festival in 2015. En heel veel dingen over rood haar. Vooraf bestellen tijdens de campagne is goedkoper dan het later kopen.

Het middelpunt van de aandacht (In the spotlight)1: Word een model voor onze festivalposters. Deze posters worden in Breda en omgeving verspreid en ze zijn gigantisch (A0 formaat)! Natuurlijk krijg je ook een aantal (10) exemplaren van jouw poster voor jezelf en je vrienden.
OF
Het middelpunt van de aandacht (In the spotlight)2: Met deze perk word je zo de roodharigen hemel in gelanceerd want jij en je camera gaan samen met Bart met een kraan de lucht in tijdens de grote fotosessie op zondag. Velen hebben gesmeekt om deze kans… Nu heb je hem!
 
De koning te rijk (The royal treatment) Wees een V.I.P. tijdens het hele Redhead Days weekend. Een organisator van de Redhead Days haalt je op van het vliegveld of elke gewenste locatie in Nederland, waarna je naar Breda wordt gebracht. Daar verblijf je in het beste hotel (inbegrepen). Tijdens het evenement dineer je met de organisatie. Natuurlijk brengen we je ook weer terug (in elk geval naar het vliegveld) en je mag kiezen uit een van de bovenstaande perks.
Wees gea-muse-erd (Be a-muse-d) Jij (of iemand van wie je houdt) wordt vereeuwigd in een groot schilderij, gemaakt door Bart, de oprichter van de Redhead Days. En daarna hangt het aan jouw muur. En als je wilt, wordt het tentoongesteld tijdens de Redhead Days 2014 kunst tentoonstelling.
 

 
Andere manieren om te helpen
 

Word vrijwilliger!Help ons bij de voorbereidingen, tijdens het festival, of allebei. Er zijn voldoende mogelijkheden en het is absoluut leuk om te doen!
Word ambassadeur:Gebruik alsjeblieft de deel-opties van Indiegogo om anderen over de campagne te vertellen.

Misschien kunnen we elkaar helpen. Wij hebben genoeg suggesties voor een interessante samenwerking en zijn benieuwd naar die van jou.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Taylor Evans, I'm currently a yoga instructor in Harrisonburg, VA. I've been practicing for 5+ years and teaching for just over a year and it's the most rewarding job I've ever had by far.  <br/><br/>I'm hear to ask for your help: I need to raise $10,000 in order to join an amazing team of individuals who work as ambassadors to <a href=""www.africayogaproject.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""www.africayogaproject.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Africa Yoga Project</a> (AYP) based in Nairobi, Kenya. </p>
<p>AYP is a non-profit organization that provides 300+ free yoga classes a week in Kenya, both in Nairobi and villages across the country. While that's awesome, what drew me to AYP was their commitment to training Kenyans to be their own leaders, in the yoga classroom and out. AYP has trained over 50 individuals to be instructors in a classroom context as well as leaders of change in their own communities, providing support to at-risk youth, the homeless, and HIV/AIDS afflicted communities. My hope is to join this wonderful team for a minimum of 14 days in service to the communities of Nairobi and beyond by donating my time and my skills as a yoga instructor, organizer, and former farmer to help build healthy and sustainable communities. <br/><br/>Yoga has changed my life beyond all my expectations. This practice has empowered me to be authentic to myself and to be of service to others in everything that I do. The small piece of peace I've come to know and love from yoga has motivated me to share this amazing tool for self-empowerment with others, I'm hoping you can help with that dream. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The total cost for the ambassador program is $10,000, all of which goes towards AYP and their projects. This may include: paying local teacher's salaries for their donation-based classes, funding education for youth throughout Kenya, funding trauma-relief training for individuals to better serve in their communities.  <br/><br/>Regardless of the total amount raised, all funding will go to AYP and the eventual fundraising goal of $10,000. For more information on AYP's business and philanthropic model, visit <a href=""http://www.africayogaproject.org/pages/our-model"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.africayogaproject.org/pages/our-model"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this link.</a>  <br/><br/>I'm asking for your help in raising at least a portion of these funds, thanks so much for your input!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>AYP works tirelessly to provide a path towards peace for individuals who might otherwise not ever get to experience the joy of getting in touch with themselves. I was drawn to AYP not only because of my personal experience with yoga, but because of their dedication to training individuals to empower themselves and their communities. The world needs leaders willing to be in action in their communities more than anything so that change becomes sustainable. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Having met and trained with several individuals from AYP, I'm unable to express the sheer joy and possibility these people have in their life thanks to this program. </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">More concretely, given the recent events in Nairobi, a significant portion of these funds will go towards providing trauma-response training to teachers so that they may better serve their communities that have been impacted by violence, corruption, and poverty.  <br/></span><br/>The funds raised will also assist me in giving back to these communities as well. Each ambassador spends one week ""observing"" and one week ""serving"" using unique skills they have. Given my experience with farming, gardening, and food production, I hope to spend my service week establishing several plots to provide food and a small outlet for stress to the communities I am assigned.  <br/><br/>Your donation can help make a direct impact in my life and the lives of the hundreds of people that pass through AYP's doors each week. Thank you so much!</p>

I've been practicing for 5+ years and teaching for just over a year and it's the most rewarding job I've ever had by far.  I'm hear to ask for your help: I need to raise $10,000 in order to join an amazing team of individuals who work as ambassadors to Africa Yoga Project (AYP) based in Nairobi, Kenya. 
AYP is a non-profit organization that provides 300+ free yoga classes a week in Kenya, both in Nairobi and villages across the country. While that's awesome, what drew me to AYP was their commitment to training Kenyans to be their own leaders, in the yoga classroom and out. AYP has trained over 50 individuals to be instructors in a classroom context as well as leaders of change in their own communities, providing support to at-risk youth, the homeless, and HIV/AIDS afflicted communities. My hope is to join this wonderful team for a minimum of 14 days in service to the communities of Nairobi and beyond by donating my time and my skills as a yoga instructor, organizer, and former farmer to help build healthy and sustainable communities. Yoga has changed my life beyond all my expectations. This practice has empowered me to be authentic to myself and to be of service to others in everything that I do. The small piece of peace I've come to know and love from yoga has motivated me to share this amazing tool for self-empowerment with others, I'm hoping you can help with that dream. 


What We Need & What You Get
The total cost for the ambassador program is $10,000, all of which goes towards AYP and their projects. This may include: paying local teacher's salaries for their donation-based classes, funding education for youth throughout Kenya, funding trauma-relief training for individuals to better serve in their communities.  Regardless of the total amount raised, all funding will go to AYP and the eventual fundraising goal of $10,000. For more information on AYP's business and philanthropic model, visit this link.  I'm asking for your help in raising at least a portion of these funds, thanks so much for your input!


The Impact
AYP works tirelessly to provide a path towards peace for individuals who might otherwise not ever get to experience the joy of getting in touch with themselves. I was drawn to AYP not only because of my personal experience with yoga, but because of their dedication to training individuals to empower themselves and their communities. The world needs leaders willing to be in action in their communities more than anything so that change becomes sustainable. Having met and trained with several individuals from AYP, I'm unable to express the sheer joy and possibility these people have in their life thanks to this program. 
More concretely, given the recent events in Nairobi, a significant portion of these funds will go towards providing trauma-response training to teachers so that they may better serve their communities that have been impacted by violence, corruption, and poverty.  The funds raised will also assist me in giving back to these communities as well. Each ambassador spends one week ""observing"" and one week ""serving"" using unique skills they have. Given my experience with farming, gardening, and food production, I hope to spend my service week establishing several plots to provide food and a small outlet for stress to the communities I am assigned.  Your donation can help make a direct impact in my life and the lives of the hundreds of people that pass through AYP's doors each week. Thank you so much!

<div>The Youth Batters Mat was an idea I came up with while watching my 4 year old at softball practice. I noticed the coach drawing lines in the sand, putting bats behind the kids, and always adjusting their legs, and so my idea was born. I designed a prototype and started the testing. The results were phenomenal. I had the Batters mat patented with a provisional patent, redesigned to work for kids aged from 4 to 13 and had a few made and sent to me for further testing. I sent pictures and videos of my product to only 2 sport retail chains and they both have placed 2000 piece orders as soon as production starts. The Youth Batters Mat will work for left handed or right handed batters, its lightweight, durable, teaches muscle memory, and improves a child's batting for softball, T'ball and baseball. I will be distributing these mats from a local warehouse facility to the distribution centers of sport retail stores.</div>
<div>The ware house is a 4000 sq ft facility and to make up some of the room I would like to open an indoor skateboard park for kids to have a place to go, off the streets, where they can be safe, active, and enjoy themselves while doing what they love, skateboarding. </div>

<h3>WHO AM I?</h3>
<div>My name is Steve, I started a residential rehab business 5 years ago that has grown to be a very successful company. I currently rehab houses for 3 different banks,2 asset companies and 2 local companies. I am married, have 2  kids, a 16 year old son, a 5 year old daughter, and both of them love to skateboard and my daughter loves softball just as much. I have been skateboarding with my son since he was 5 years old and my daughter just started 2 years ago. I am very active personally and professionally.</div>

<div>The first order of mats will cost me $32,000 to get them printed and shipped, I have already spent roughly $12,000 in design and manufacturing thus far to get to a final product and to have it patented. The Warehouse cost I am covering myself as i do have my own funds aside for this project. The wooden ramps in the warehouse for the park will cost roughly $25,000 to build.

<div><b style=""letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 30px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: x-large;"">WHAT WILL THE IMPACT BE?</b></div>
<div>We have decided that if this campaign is successful we will donate $1 from every Batters Mat sold to the Richland NICU hospital so they can maintain and keep the equipment they need to save childrens' lives just as they did with my daughter, she was dead for 3 1/2 minutes when she was born and had lost 2/3 of her blood. We will also hold 2 fundraisers a year at the skate park, 1 for the American Cancer Society as this is important because I lost my mother to cancer when i was 20, and 1 for the local fire dept. and police dept. because these are the people that put their lives on the line for us and our kids when we need them. I believe holding these fundraisers will teach the kids how to give back to the community in a positive way and teach them the positive impact they can make to their community and the people in it. They are they future!</div>

I am Araya (like A-Ray-A Sunshine).  I am a wife,
mother of two and gal behind Wind & Willow Home.  I created Wind &
Willow Home two years ago out of necessity when I was laid off after twelve years as
a Kitchen and Bath Designer.  I decided to channel the same passion for
beauty and functional design into creating a line of modern-classic wooden housewares.
I design, then slowly hand dip each piece into a custom rubber material that I
carefully mix in my basement studio in Minneapolis, Minnesota.     ____________________________________________________________GROWINGWhile I completely love creating modern
wooden housewares, I am consistently getting requests for coordinating table
wares such as tea towels, napkins and table linens in the same organic modern to
style Wind and Willow Home has come to be known by. I am excited
to have this crowd funding opportunity to accommodate these requests and introduce
a line of soft goods that complement the cheerful aesthetic of my housewares as
the next step in growing my business.
    ______________________________________________________________PAYING IT FORWARD
It has always been a dream of mine to help change people’s lives.
I have been so fortunate in this endeavor that I want to show my gratitude by
paying it forward.   A portion of the funds raised through this Indigogo
campaign will help to launch our BOWL FULL initiatives.  Through
the BOWL FULL project, Wind & Willow Home will donate a minimum of 1
meal per item sold to feed the hungry near and far, in addition to volunteering
our time in pursuit of this cause.  
    ____________________________________________________________HOW YOU CAN HELPI need your help!  I am turning to my strongest
supporters to ask for contributions to assist with my growth plans. I need to
raise $12,200 to help cover the cost of materials, development, production and support to bring the soft goods line to life.  I also need to hire professional help to integrate the giving aspect
into the website in order to launch the BOWL FULL project and help to hire our first
full-time employee to assist in increasing operations.42% of your pledges will cover the raw materials, inks and set up needed to begin creating the first full line of our new collection.
18% of your pledges will cover the production costs associated with the first run of product.
30% 
of your pledges will go to hiring the necessary professional website design and development help to integrate the giving aspect of the BOWL FULL project into our website.
The remaining
10% will go towards incentives and admin. fees   ____________________________________________________________
GIVING AT IT'S BESTIn exchange for your help, I'm offering some exclusive products
made only for this event.  I am also
giving you a chance to join the creative team by producing an exclusive color,
in your name, to add to our seasonal offerings. Your contribution will help maintain my important retail partnerships, grow the brand and further, it will help Wind
& Willow Home stay at the forefront of
modern housewares while doing good for others.  These incentives are 
			geared toward giving, whether it be for Mother's Day, Wedding Gifts 
			or a great piece for a Graduate.  It's a great way 
			for you to score fantastic products in addition to helping a small business 
			grow. It's giving at it's best.    ____________________________________________________________WHY SUPPORT MY PROJECT

<h3>Minifigs Bricks and More needs your help to open our doors</h3>
<p>We are a company that specializes in New and Used Lego® Merchandise. We have been selling Lego® products on the internet for more than five years. It has been our dream to open a brick and mortar store since 2007. It will be like a Gamestop®, but with Lego products. (The Gamestop® of Lego®) We will also provide a great place to have a birthday party. We are Minifigs Bricks and More, LLC.</p>
<p>We are running this campaign because we have been approved by a bank for a $25,000 line of credit. Which is great news, but the one stipulation is that we come up with $25,000 of our own money before they will open the line of credit. Without your help to make this campaign succeed, the brick and mortar store will not open. The dream of bringing an awesome Lego experience to Denton, TX will just remain a dream.</p>
<p>The bank has agreed to use our $10,000 in inventory as part of the $25,000 stipulation. So it is vital to raise the remaining $15,000 to get our store off the ground.</p>
<p>We will use the $15,000 from this campaign to buy key items for our store (i.e. POS machines, fixtures, computers) as well as securing a lease on a store front. Any amount that you could contribute would be awesome!  We also have some great perks such as Lego Minifigures, Lego blocks, and birthday parties.</p>
<p>Finally, we need your help in sharing our campaign to the social media world. Please <em>tweet, like, +1, pin, instagram, yelp,</em> and <em>share</em> our campaign and website on all of your social media outlets to get the word out and make this campaign a success.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>I have already explained what we need, so here is what YOU get. By contributing to the campaign you will receive many awesome items once our store opens, such as build your own Lego minifigs, Lego blocks, and even birthday parties. Check out the perks on the right side of this page.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This campaign is just a starter to bigger and brighter things for Minifigs Bricks and More. Some future plans include: after school enrichment programs involving Lego Robotics, sponsoring and helping out a First Lego League team (Robotics Team).  Many more ideas are in the works and we can share them at a later date.</p>
<p>As parents of three, we love kids and enjoy spending time with them. Lego® is a great teaching tool and we are excited to show kids how to not only have fun but to learn while having fun. Science, Technology, Engineering and Math are the areas of education we would like to reach. As teachers at heart we see Lego as the perfect toy to acheive this.</p>
<p>Our store will also have a large impact on the local environment. We will provide a place for people to bring their Lego pieces in for store credit or cash, rather than throwing them in the local dump. I can't tell you how many times I have heard that parents just throw their kids Lego in the garbage.</p>

<h3>For Each Item Purchased We Will Donate An Item To Someone In Need.</h3>
<p>Katavi has developed a natural sunscreen made from 75% organic ingredients to safely fight against the sun’s harsh rays. Our sunscreen was created while taking into consideration our environment, our customers, and those in need. We want to bring you with <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.katavisun.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/tubeshot.png"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 5px;""/>the best natural sunscreen at a competitive price. In addition, we want to extend our belief in proper sun protection to other great products including sun protective clothing, sun protective hats, lip balms, and more.</p>
<p>This Indiegogo project was started to help us raise the funds needed to finish our line of sunscreen, graphic t-shirts, and to help us raise awareness for the Katavi brand and mission. Our commitment to the ""buy one, give one"" model begins with this project. Your donations will not only supply you with awesome sunscreen and sun gear, it will also send those same items to someone in need.</p>
<p>Katavi was founded under the simple notion that everyone deserves proper sun protection.

<p>Hi, we are Damiano and Dario, two brothers from Rome, Italy. We are both fans of Robotics, Computer programming and electronics.</p>
<p>We would like to present you a new <strong>Open Source</strong> mechanical system designed mainly for the development of robotics solutions.</p>
<p><em>Have you ever dreamed of a system similar to the one you played when you were a child, but that allows you to create professional machines?</em></p>
<p>This system is already here!</p>
<p><img alt=""Features"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.rackbot.com/images/igg/features.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Features""/></p>
<p>We have called this system Rackbot (N.B. We are currently looking for a new name)</p>
<p>This system is based on a series of professional aluminum metal components that can be interconnected with each other using screws and nuts to create an infinite number of combinations.</p>
<p>Our system allows to create:</p>
<ul>
<li>Robotics Chassis</li>
<li>Robotics Arms</li>
<li>Computer Cases</li>
<li>Boxes, Cubes, Parallelepipeds</li>
<li>Electronics Boards Holders</li>
<li>Frames for Vehicles models</li>
<li>Rovers</li>
<li>Electric Motors and RC Servo Brackets</li>
<li>Moving Parts</li>
<li>Suspensions Systems</li>
<li>Whatever your imagination can create!</li>
</ul><p><img alt=""System"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.rackbot.com/images/igg/system.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""System""/></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2 class=""p1""><strong>Our Dream</strong></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span>Our solution was born from problems we have personally experienced regarding the difficulty in finding material for mechanics prototyping.</span></p>
<p><span>Our philosophy was to create a fully compatible hardware and software ecosystem, a reference point for those who want to invent and create <em>without wasting time and money</em> searching for components from different suppliers and without building mechanical parts with wood, plastic and non-professional materials.</span></p>
<p>When we designed our chassis system we had the following features in mind:</p>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li class=""li1"">
<strong>Durable</strong>, professional and light components made in <strong>Aluminum</strong>
</li>
<li class=""li1"">Smart project design: <strong>very few pieces to build everything!</strong>
</li>
<li class=""li1""><strong>Easily hackable and expandable with DIY components</strong></li>
<li class=""li1""><strong>Open Source!</strong></li>
<li class=""li1"">Support for electronic boards, servomotors, electric engines, sensors and wheels</li>
<li class=""li1"">Development Kits for Mechanics, Rovers, Hexapods, Humanoid Robots and Arms</li>
<li class=""li1""><strong>Arduino based electronics</strong></li>
<li class=""li1"">Smartphone support: <strong>iPhone and Android</strong>
</li>
<li class=""li1"">And, last but not least, a <strong>Stunning Cutting-Edge design!</strong>

<p> </p></div>","Introducing our Robotics Development Environment
Hi, we are Damiano and Dario, two brothers from Rome, Italy. We are both fans of Robotics, Computer programming and electronics.
We would like to present you a new Open Source mechanical system designed mainly for the development of robotics solutions.
Have you ever dreamed of a system similar to the one you played when you were a child, but that allows you to create professional machines?
This system is already here!

We have called this system Rackbot (N.B. We are currently looking for a new name)
This system is based on a series of professional aluminum metal components that can be interconnected with each other using screws and nuts to create an infinite number of combinations.
Our system allows to create:

Robotics Chassis
Robotics Arms
Computer Cases
Boxes, Cubes, Parallelepipeds
Electronics Boards Holders
Frames for Vehicles models
Rovers
Electric Motors and RC Servo Brackets
Moving Parts
Suspensions Systems
Whatever your imagination can create!

 
Our Dream
Our solution was born from problems we have personally experienced regarding the difficulty in finding material for mechanics prototyping.
Our philosophy was to create a fully compatible hardware and software ecosystem, a reference point for those who want to invent and create without wasting time and money searching for components from different suppliers and without building mechanical parts with wood, plastic and non-professional materials.
When we designed our chassis system we had the following features in mind:


Durable, professional and light components made in Aluminum

Smart project design: very few pieces to build everything!

Easily hackable and expandable with DIY components
Open Source!
Support for electronic boards, servomotors, electric engines, sensors and wheels
Development Kits for Mechanics, Rovers, Hexapods, Humanoid Robots and Arms
Arduino based electronics
Smartphone support: iPhone and Android

And, last but not least, a Stunning Cutting-Edge design!

 
Open Source!

When we will open again the website we will release this system under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License to enable students and researchers to expand the chassis without any restrictions.  This means that the community will contribuite to expand the ecosystem!
 
What we want to do
We would like to offer several, well documented, different types of development kits:
The Arduino Development Kits - The Brain
These Development Kits include an Arduino, a breadboard, a LCD, several hardware parts and a cool chassis! The most advanced kit is called iDK.

We have over 15 years experience in the sale of new and Pre-owned vehicles, a lot of times assisting those who cannot get traditional financing obtain great transportation. However, recently I was involved in a very unique transaction. A woman with children was attempting to buy a car to escape from an abusive situation. This woman, unfortunately, did not have the resources to buy a car. I could see her frustration. I could see her fear. I gave her some information about places that might be able to help her, she thanked me, she left, and that situation continued to haunt me to this very day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After doing some serious research on the problem that women with children coming out of serious, abusive situations were facing, I found that most of these women were not only without the funds for transportation but they were also without the funds needed to create a fresh start. In many cases, all they really want is to get away from the danger.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was overwhelmed by how wide spread this situation is nationwide. Many times these women are from other countries and have been abandoned with no resources. I did find that there are some organizations out there that receive donated cars and try to help, but it seems that many of these cars are far from being in the condition that would be useful in the long run. So at long last, Cars For Moms With Children was born.</p>
<p>Our goal is to provide these families with a car that will not require any money out of their pocket. All paid. Car, Tax, and License fees. This is my campaign, because I’m an auto dealer with the capability to buy at discount prices and with the capability to restore these cars to a comfortable, reliable condition. This is where you can help. Doris and I are raising funds to get cars for these women in serious need free of charge to them. We will be working with organizations around the country that have such women in need of this program. And what types of cars can we provide? These cars will be 2002, or newer, 4-door sedans that will be in great running condition and look great inside and out that will give the women receiving these cars the self-esteem and confidence they’re going to need to build a new foundation for their life. These cars will also come with a 1-year, 12,000 mile warranty and a full tank of gas at time of delivery.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our goal in this first round of fundraising is to deliver 20 cars to such families across the country. It takes approximately $7000 to $8500 which includes tax, license fees, and warrantee per car. And we are not charging any dealer fees for these cars. So with $175,000 dollars raised, this can be accomplished in a short time frame since it takes about a week from purchase to recondition for a car to be ready because we have our own shops that can do everything that’s needed to get these cars ready for the families they will be given to. If we do not reach our goal we will still deliver as many cars as can be provided.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hopefully you will never have to sit in front of a woman with children who is terrified and looking for help, but by donating toward this campaign you will have a dramatic effect on a families in need. We encourage you to get involved, tell your family and friends, and spread the word with us because every car delivered is a family free to create a new start.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our sincerest thanks,</p>

<p>We have all heard of sports bars, pubs, luxury bars, gay bars, clubs, college bars, dive bars and so on. Our project is to create a new bar! A new bar that will be better than any bar before! This will be a community bar, new innovative and full of risk! A mix between a sports bar, a club, a pub, and dive bar. We will have everything you are used to but with dozens of new aspects brought to the bar scene. Making the Bar a happy, safe, upbeat and fun environment from open to close. The design is formatted to engage all the parties in the bar, the atmosphere inside the bar has a fun factor only rivaled by an amusement park. Although Alcohol is a depressant, it is clear Americans love alcohol for a variety of reasons. The number 1 reason is because a few drinks let one be themselves, less shy, more fun, happier, able to let loose, add some confidence, etc. The bar scenes today don't allow people to do what they enjoy to fullest! Our project will bring a new view, atmosphere and environment to bars in the long run. We will emerge as the worlds first hands-on bar with rewards for repeat clients/friends, chances for prizes on a daily basis and a new engaging and competitive environment which will include everyone and exclude no one, lead to new friendships and relationships as well as a brand new level of fun and experience that everyone will want to have!  </p>

Update: 1 December 2013

IT'S OFFICIAL! 
WE REACHED OUR FIRST GOAL!
If there hadn’t been quite so much shouting and clapping, we’d say we were speechless.

We’ve also still got a whole bunch of days left in this campaign...


Our first stretch goal is to reach a total of $8,000. If we make it to this amount, we'll not only be able to follow through with our plans to pay for our legal bills, open a bank account, and fulfill your donor perks, but we could ALSO subsidize the cost of attendance for at least five students to attend our youthROOTS program next summer. 
Keep posting links to this campaign. Keep reposting stuff on Facebook and retweeting our Twitter updates. Honestly, all of those things help. 
And of course, if you've been waiting to donate ... we'd really appreciate it if you could. 
This campaign will end on December 18th. That's a handful of Wednesdays from now. You've been amazing already, but we know we can do even more.

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>If you found yourself here, hopefully you know who we are.  (In case you don't, we are the Last Bookstore, the largest used &amp; new bookstore in southern CA).  This is our fundraiser page to pay for the lumber and labor to expand our store into 6100 sq. ft. of the mezzanine above our ground floor. </p>
<p>We have an insane floor plan for the mezzanine that will be an adventure all by itself for you all to explore!  We're calling it the ""Labyrinth above the Last Bookstore,"" because we like alliteration (although it's not really a true labyrinth).  We'll even be opening up the walls so you can see up into the Labyrinth from below and our store will become a true two-floor book bonanzarama.</p>
<p>The Labyrinth will house over 100,000 books, all $1 each.  We are <strong>drowning</strong> in good books and need more space to pass them along to you dirt cheap.  Half of all net proceeds from the mezzanine will go to support tutoring homeless kids on Skid Row.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<ul>
<li>Our starting goal is $10,000 to pay for the lumber.  That's the minimum we need to stay out of additional crushing debt.</li>
<li>We <em>could</em> also really use an additional $10,000 to pay the workers to assemble the Labyrinthine floor plan all this month.  To avoid further debt.</li>
<li>If you want to pledge it up higher than $20,000, we would use the money towards making the new floor super awesome with local design and art commissioned from local artists.  So pledge away!</li>
<li>When you pledge your support now to this campaign, you'll actually make 20-100% on your money thanks to our store credit perks (i.e. rewards).  See them all along the right side of our page.  It's better than the stock market...if books are your currency.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
If you already know and love us, you know what to do.  If not, come and visit our store (the gigantic new one opened June, 2011) at 453 S Spring St in downtown LA and then make up your mind whether to pledge or not.  We've put almost every dollar we've ever made back into making our store as amazing and positive for our local community as we can, and our expansion will be no different. </div>
<div>
<h3>No Money?</h3>
</div>
<div>If you have no money, we understand.  We ourselves are only able to do this by borrowing money!  But you can still help by sending the link to this fundraiser to other book-lovers you know who do have a few dollars to spare in keeping printed books alive and on the shelves of independent bookstores like ours.</div>
<h3>Finally, an Apology...</h3>
<div>...for our lame video.  We aren't filmmakers and owner Josh always looks sleepy.  He and his wife shot the video and learned how to use iMovie in a couple hours to make it.  We didn't have the funds to get a pro video made.  Hopefully you can overlook that and support us anyway!</div></div>","Short Summary

As a kid I selfishly dreamt about defying my parents, being on stage and creating my own works of comedic flare with a slew of adoring fans. That was my cause. And as life would have it, my parents were right. On my own terms my dream has come true with the success of my young adult writing career. </p>
<p>But that's not the end of my story. Life had way more in store for me. After the publication of my first two novels, I decided to run off into the mountains of Northern New Mexico. I sought a deeper connection with the earth, the seasons, and myself. I came from a family of farm workers and activists (as college students my parents organized for farm worker rights with Cesar Chavez). What I remember most though was my grandfather Julian Dumlao, a Filipino immigrant, who arrived in the Imperial Valley with nothing but the clothes on his back. As a kid I remember going to his ranch, playing with his fighting roosters, and the delicate affection he showed to his tomato plants.  My grandfather was also right, I needed that connection to the land.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since 2006 I've worked with the Traditional Native American Farmers' Association (TNAFA) in Santa Fe, NM. TNAFA is a collective of Indigenous farmers committed to the preservation of traditional agricultural techniques and practices and building sustainable communities amongst indigenous communities across the Americas. Through TNAFA I have learned about permaculture, GMOs, and seed sovereignty. In addition, I've become a part of a network of agroecology leaders across the USA, Mexico, Belize, and Guatemala who are all working for community food security.</p>
<p>In 2012 I moved to San Jose, California and became the manager of Sacred Heart Community Service, La Mesa Verde Program (LMV). LMV started as a kitchen garden program for low-income families in San Jose. Since joining the program, we have moved a step further into building sustainable and sovereign urban food secure communities through the development of critically conscious home-scale food producers. In short, a grassroots food sovereignty movement.</p>
<p>Slow Food USA has invited 220 food movement leaders to join the U.S. delegation to a landmark international food and farming conference on October 25-29 in Turin, Italy. Being selected for this historic event is a special honor. The 220 U.S. delegates were chosen from a competitive pool of 600 applicants by 20 regional selection committees comprised of Slow Food and Terra Madre leaders. With almost 25% people of color and folks from 50 different food communities spanning all sectors of the food movement from labor to production to students, this year’s delegation is by far the most diverse the U.S. has ever sent. Delegates play a key role in showcasing good, clean, and fair products and practices, leading workshops, and speaking on issues from land grabbing to GMOs to gastronomy.</p>
<p>I am proud to have been chosen to represent TNAFA and Sacred Heart's LMV families. As an urban woman of color, I feel like it is my duty (<em>cause)</em> to bring light to the issues and needs of urban working poor communities to an international audience. </p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>I need $1200 to cover the cost of my flight to Italy. As an invited representative all the expenses on site will be covered by Slow Food International i.e., the entrance fee, housing, and ground transportation.</p>
<p>**Perks**</p>
<p>For $25 donation you get an autographed copy of my new teen book Border Town ""Crossing the Line"".</p>
<p>For $50 donation you get a kitchen towel (hand made by my mother).</p>
<p>For $100 donation you get set of tea towels and home made bottle of organic salsa.</p>
<p>For $500 donation you get a one hour skype author presentation or a harvest basket (filled with a handcrafted kitchen towel, fruits of our garden TBD, and one of my books).</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>The Slow Food Conference is a global response to the work I do locally in regards to local food issues. A backyard garden effects the global food production just as the drought in the Midwest effects food production everywhere in the world. I will be able to make connections with other community projects, food researchers, chefs, and community leaders and bring back ideas on organizing food issues. In addition, the majority of the families I work with are transnational; the issues around food are transnational. Since the beginning of time, people have been transnational and have moved in search of food. Issues of food security and food sovereignty are transnational issues that need transnational solidarity.</p>

<h3>Live Free, Think Big, Get Tiny...</h3>
<p> After spending a good amount of time in a variety of living areas, Kendra is seeking something more. Whether living urban, suburban, rural or in the wilderness, there's always a price to pay. Rent payments are neverending, and no kind of investment to speak of. To make a home somewhere so often means signing up for a mortgage or non-stop payment. The jobs we love can't afford us a living, and we work tirelessly and spend the rest of our money trying to make ourselves happy while we work in jobs we're not fully fulfilled by. Folks who are unfufilled will often seek to travel to somewhere new to start a living, where they eventually find themselves trapped in the same cycle.</p>
<p>How can we pay off these debts, live a more connected, mindful life, and pursue that which fulfills us? How can we build a life that helps us live more sustainably on this planet?</p>
<p>Tiny houses are moveable, personalized living spaces that allow their owner to simplify their life. It opens the homeowner to new flexible life choices and frees them from the limitations of renting a home. This allows you to choose new life paths that would otherwise be unsustainable, and take your cozy home with you!</p>
<p>Kendra plans to build her Tiny Home when the sun comes back to Seattle. From there she hopes build a farm, create a community center and continue her passion of working in outdoor education and community healing. She may even start a food truck (or food cabin on wheels), or help you build your tiny home, or your dream. Let's free up our time and our lives to connect with what really matters to us.</p>

<p><strong> </strong>My name is David Giesbrecht and I am an 18 year old Canadian nursing student. I am passionate about helping people and making a difference through medical care.</p>
<p>During recent visits to Haiti and Kenya, I witnessed grinding poverty and its impact on life expectancy. I became inspired to make a difference and I am convinced of a fundamental reality: for a community to be strong, local leaders need to be at the heart of <strong>change and development</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Local leaders have sustainable solutions, but current aid decisions are made by the people giving the money and this out-dated method has not been effective.</p>
<p><strong>I want to ask</strong> rural nurses in areas of extreme poverty how their communities can be self-sufficient, using available resources to strengthen medical care, small business, food security and civic governance. <strong>I want to </strong><strong>learn</strong> from indigenous leaders on the ground in impoverished regions. Through local, relevant insights and responses, I will develop a plan to partner with nurses worldwide for the development of sustainable communities.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2013, I will be living in rural Tanzania for 3 months, helping local nurses administer medical care in remote villages. The regions I will be working in experience high rates of under-five mortality and maternal death. While in the Sumbawanga District, I will be able to interview nurses to explore effective and sustainable aid solutions. I will also be visiting areas in Kenya and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The answers I discover will be documented in partnership with a videographer.</p>
<p>In order for this project to be a full success, I need to raise money. The first priority of all funds raised is to make my upcoming trip financially possible. I will dedicate 100% of all funds raised to that goal. However, if I am able to raise more than what I need for that trip, I will use the extra money to help make my nursing education possible.</p>
<p>You can be a part of this process as I seek to begin helping people in a practical way, starting now. If just 1000 people donated $25, I would be able to succeed in not just this trip and but the education beyond. </p>

I will dedicate 100% of all funds raised to that goal. However, if I am able to raise more than what I need for that trip, I will use the extra money to help make my nursing education possible.
You can be a part of this process as I seek to begin helping people in a practical way, starting now. If just 1000 people donated $25, I would be able to succeed in not just this trip and but the education beyond. 
Check out my video and send it to your friends. Let’s work together to help people worldwide.

<h3>Why Fund Us?</h3>
<p>LU Radio is a campus based community radio station located in Thunder Bay, Ontario Canada. We are partially funded by the students of Lakehead University, as well as by fundraising, and the small amount of advertising allowed to a not-for-profit station (approximately 4 minutes per hour).</p>
<p>LU Radio runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Our budget is approximately $90,000 a year to keep the station running at an incredibly bare bones level. That means keeping the station running at the bare minimum costs approximately $10.30 per hour. We have only two full time employees* to keep things running and about 50 volunteers doing their shows and pitching in where they can. The student funding from Lakehead University is traditionally around $60,000 however this year with enrollment down, we can expect that to be closer to $55,000. This means a short fall of approximately $35,000 that we need to make up through fundraising, donations and the little bit of advertising we are allowed to do. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>You may have noticed in the calculations that our campaign goal doesn’t reflect what we need for a total…well, that’s because this is all new for us. We’re hoping that all of you out there will help us blow past the campaign goal, but if we meet the set out goal, that’s okay too!</p>
<p>*We actually have a third full time employee this year, however this position (the Local News Director) is currently funded through a grant from the Community Radio Fund of Canada, and the funding runs out in August.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Where will the money we earn from Fund Drive go?</h3>
<p>Well, it will help things like: SOCAN fees which we need to pay every year for the right to broadcast music; the new tariffs being proposed by RE:SOUND which would have us paying for the right to stream the music over the internet as well; continuing the Local News Directors position until at we are at least able to obtain a further grant; repair and replace some of our aging CD Players and other equipment…yes, there are plenty of things to do with the money. All of which result in the same thing: continuing the ability of LU Radio to bring free broadcast training to volunteers, allowing the voices of people with no other avenue to be heard, and giving grass roots media and independent music a home in Thunder Bay. </p>

<p>Walden opened it's doors in 1976 with the goal to create a treatment level foster care program that would provide foster youth with an alternative to group home placements. Now in it's 37th year, Walden is a recognized leader in providing programs and services to foster youth with special health care needs and foster youth who have developmental disabilities.</p>
<p><br/>In 2008 Walden secured an adoption license and expanded services to become a full service adoption agency providing support from the initial family assessment through post-adoptive support.</p>
<p><br/>Walden is raising $5,500 to send our foster youth to summer camps where they learn valuable leadership and social skills, set in an unforgettable childhood experience. A tragedy of the foster care system is that our children miss experiencing the joys of childhood so many of us take for granted. Your donation means a Walden foster youth can live this cherished right of passage and have a lifetime of memories.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Walden's Need</h3>
<p>Walden's foster youth are eligibile for camp scholarships because of their special health care needs and developmental disabilities - but we still need your help to send them on the adventure of a lifetime.</p>
<div>
<p>$5,500 will allow Walden to send 33 youth to camp this summer, paying for the cost of room and board; meals; transportation; special activities and equipment; and any miscellaneous items youth need in order to spend time away from home.</p>

<p>Memories of summers spent at camp are unqiue and special to all of us. One Walden Social Worker described camp as ""the best six summers of my life, you live ten months for those two!""</p>
<p>For many of us camp was our first time away from home, our first taste of independence and we immediately wanted to come back every summer thereafter. For Walden foster youth with special health care needs and developmental disabilities this is truly the experience of a life time, a place where they can revel in the excitement of childhood and simply enjoy being children.</p>
<p>When you make a donation to Walden's Summer Camps 4 Foster Youth Campaign, you're giving more than just money. You're giving trail rides and canoe trips, camp fire sing alongs and roasted marshmallows, capture the flag and late night card games, best friends and pen-pals. You're giving adventures and memories.</p>
Your donation means a summer of excitement and a lifetime of possibilities.</div>

</div></div>","Walden Family Services
Walden opened it's doors in 1976 with the goal to create a treatment level foster care program that would provide foster youth with an alternative to group home placements. Now in it's 37th year, Walden is a recognized leader in providing programs and services to foster youth with special health care needs and foster youth who have developmental disabilities.
In 2008 Walden secured an adoption license and expanded services to become a full service adoption agency providing support from the initial family assessment through post-adoptive support.
Walden is raising $5,500 to send our foster youth to summer camps where they learn valuable leadership and social skills, set in an unforgettable childhood experience. A tragedy of the foster care system is that our children miss experiencing the joys of childhood so many of us take for granted. Your donation means a Walden foster youth can live this cherished right of passage and have a lifetime of memories.
 
Walden's Need
Walden's foster youth are eligibile for camp scholarships because of their special health care needs and developmental disabilities - but we still need your help to send them on the adventure of a lifetime.

$5,500 will allow Walden to send 33 youth to camp this summer, paying for the cost of room and board; meals; transportation; special activities and equipment; and any miscellaneous items youth need in order to spend time away from home.

</p><p></p>
<p><b>Everyone knows capitalism is broken. </b><br/></p><p>Here's one little thing we can all do to start fixing it.<br/></p><p><b>What is Community Commerce?</b> <br/></p><p>Simply, Community Commerce is the radical idea
that a business can also operate for the benefit of the community it serves rather
than for just stockholders.</p><p>Sunnyside Up Café in Corvallis, OR has long
contributed to the community in ways that go beyond the mere requirements of commerce.
In addition to great organic coffee and food, Sunnyside Up provides a place to
meet new people, a place to gather with old friends, a place to connect with
the community. From our local donation programs, to supporting the Empty Bowls
program, to our Community Food Share, and Drop-In Center contributions, to our soup for the homeless program, to
hosting fundraisers and the Second Saturday Concert series, we strive to contribute
to the well-being of our fair city.</p>
<p>But that's just a part-time effort. What if we could put <u>all</u> the resources of a profitable business to work for the community all the time?</p><p>We are proposing community stewardship of Sunnyside Up, in the
form of a non-profit organization. Our goal is to raise $225,000 through
donations in order to establish a non-profit entity that will take
over the operation of Sunnyside Up.</p>
<p>From that point forward, all profits from the café will be
used to support organizations such as the South <a href=""http://www.southcorvallisfoodbank.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Corvallis Food Bank</a>, the
<a href=""http://www.jsysi.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jackson Street Youth Shelter</a>, <a href=""http://communityservices.us/nutrition/detail/category/linn-benton-food-share/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Community Food Share</a>, the <a href=""http://www.corvallisenvironmentalcenter.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Corvallis Environmental Center</a>,
the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/CSCYouthGarden"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Youth Garden Project</a>, <a href=""http://www.communityoutreachinc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Community Outreach</a>, <a href=""http://casa-vfc.org/home.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CASA</a>, <a href=""http://www.emptybowls.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Empty Bowls</a>, etc.</p><p>A portion of the proceeds would also be set aside each year for national and global efforts such as <a href=""http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Doctors Without Borders</a>, <a href=""http://www.heifer.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Heifer International</a>, and <a href=""http://rollingjubilee.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rolling Jubilee</a>.<br/></p>
<p>The idea is to extend our service to the community from part-time to all of the time. This concept has a multiplier effect
that will turn your small one-time donation into $35-$50,000 worth of charitable
donations <u>every year</u>.</p><p>And by virtue of being a non-profit organization, all our tax money that the government squanders on senseless wars and bank bailouts, will now go directly to the people who need it, without politicians being able to meddle with it.<br/></p>
<p><b>Community Commerce</b>.
It’s a powerful idea that could help transform lives, cities,
and maybe even the concept of capitalism.  Your donation to make this happen is a donation that keeps on donating.</p><p><b>Process</b>: All donations will be set aside until we reach our funding
goal. The funds will be used to</p>
<p>1) establish the non-profit entity </p>
<p>2) set aside a capital reserve fund for Sunnyside Up </p>
<p>3) transfer ownership of Sunnyside Up to the non-profit</p><p>4) provide help to the people who need it most in an ongoing, self-sustaining basis<br/></p><span>We look upon this proposal as a unique way to help strengthen our community</span> and expand the traditional boundaries of what capitalism does, for the betterment of all.<br/><br/>Thank you for listening.<br/><br/>You can check us out here: <a href=""http://sunnyside-up-cafe.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sunnyside-up-cafe.com</a><br/><br/><b>Community Commerce. Help make it happen here. And then everywhere.</b><br/><br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><p><b>Full Disclosure:</b></p>
<p>Our total investment
in Sunnyside Up, over the course of a dozen years, is nearly a quarter million dollars. We’re not trying to enrich ourselves from this effort. We would
like to recoup $150—175k from the business. We will consider the difference between what we've
invested and what we raise to be our contribution to this idea.</p>
<p>Funds donated
that exceed what we need will go to the capital reserve fund of the non-profit, legal
expenses for establishing the non-profit, taxes, and fees from the fundraising effort (did you know they charge for this stuff?).</p>
<p>If we raise a
million bucks, we’ll use it to turn other profitable businesses into non-profits. Maybe we'll start a movement. Maybe people everywhere will realize the benefits of using business to help one another rather than just for the sake of profit.</p><p>  Occupy everything. <br/></p>___________________________________________________<br/><b>FAQ</b><br/><br/>

<br/></div>","Everyone knows capitalism is broken. Here's one little thing we can all do to start fixing it.What is Community Commerce? Simply, Community Commerce is the radical idea
that a business can also operate for the benefit of the community it serves rather
than for just stockholders.Sunnyside Up Café in Corvallis, OR has long
contributed to the community in ways that go beyond the mere requirements of commerce.
In addition to great organic coffee and food, Sunnyside Up provides a place to
meet new people, a place to gather with old friends, a place to connect with
the community. From our local donation programs, to supporting the Empty Bowls
program, to our Community Food Share, and Drop-In Center contributions, to our soup for the homeless program, to
hosting fundraisers and the Second Saturday Concert series, we strive to contribute
to the well-being of our fair city.
But that's just a part-time effort. What if we could put all the resources of a profitable business to work for the community all the time?We are proposing community stewardship of Sunnyside Up, in the
form of a non-profit organization. Our goal is to raise $225,000 through
donations in order to establish a non-profit entity that will take
over the operation of Sunnyside Up.
From that point forward, all profits from the café will be
used to support organizations such as the South Corvallis Food Bank, the
Jackson Street Youth Shelter, Community Food Share, the Corvallis Environmental Center,
the Youth Garden Project, Community Outreach, CASA, Empty Bowls, etc.A portion of the proceeds would also be set aside each year for national and global efforts such as Doctors Without Borders, Heifer International, and Rolling Jubilee.
The idea is to extend our service to the community from part-time to all of the time. This concept has a multiplier effect
that will turn your small one-time donation into $35-$50,000 worth of charitable
donations every year.And by virtue of being a non-profit organization, all our tax money that the government squanders on senseless wars and bank bailouts, will now go directly to the people who need it, without politicians being able to meddle with it.
Community Commerce.
It’s a powerful idea that could help transform lives, cities,
and maybe even the concept of capitalism.  Your donation to make this happen is a donation that keeps on donating.Process: All donations will be set aside until we reach our funding
goal. The funds will be used to
1) establish the non-profit entity 
2) set aside a capital reserve fund for Sunnyside Up 
3) transfer ownership of Sunnyside Up to the non-profit4) provide help to the people who need it most in an ongoing, self-sustaining basisWe look upon this proposal as a unique way to help strengthen our community and expand the traditional boundaries of what capitalism does, for the betterment of all.Thank you for listening.You can check us out here: sunnyside-up-cafe.comCommunity Commerce. Help make it happen here. And then everywhere.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Full Disclosure:
Our total investment
in Sunnyside Up, over the course of a dozen years, is nearly a quarter million dollars. We’re not trying to enrich ourselves from this effort. We would
like to recoup $150—175k from the business. We will consider the difference between what we've
invested and what we raise to be our contribution to this idea.
Funds donated
that exceed what we need will go to the capital reserve fund of the non-profit, legal
expenses for establishing the non-profit, taxes, and fees from the fundraising effort (did you know they charge for this stuff?).
If we raise a
million bucks, we’ll use it to turn other profitable businesses into non-profits. Maybe we'll start a movement. Maybe people everywhere will realize the benefits of using business to help one another rather than just for the sake of profit.  Occupy everything. ___________________________________________________FAQ

<h3></h3>
<p>     Since 1928, people have walked by a classic red brick
structure with white pillars on Forest Avenue in Oak Park.  This historic landmark building across from
Austin Gardens is the Nineteenth Century Charitable Association and is an
attractive and popular venue for community events.</p>
<p>     In 2012, The Nineteenth Century
hosted 349 events: 80% non-profit events and 20% were private rentals. More than 24,000 people attended averaging 2,000
people per month.        </p>
<p>   The Nineteenth Century Charitable Association dates back to
1891 when a group of far-sighted women realized that education and civic
involvement were essential to a vibrant community.  The organization provided opportunities for
women and developed support systems for families within the community.  It was instrumental in establishing the OPRF
Day Nursery, League of Women Voters and Infant Welfare.  Many were leaders in the women’s suffragette
movement.  We continue our tradition of
Learning and Giving by promoting social responsibility and life-long learning
through scholarships, community grants and programs for intergenerational,
ethnically diverse audiences.</p>
<p>     2013 finds the building in need of extensive exterior and interior
restoration.  The Board of Directors
invites you to join our major effort of restoration by supporting a three-year
capital campaign to raise $500,000.  The
Board and members have raised more than 70% of the funds needed.</p>

The restaurant will be based on the style of popular franchises like Chipotle except that the food would be fast and healthy Indian style food. The featured product would be fresh flavored Indian bread (naan) baked in tandoori ovens directly in front of guests. To open the restaurant to non-Indian customers, the restaurant would have a simple menu with no Indian food names, have innovative and less spicy food options, and feature a modern decor rather than a traditIonal decor. </p>

</div></div>","Did you know that 50% of start-up businesses fail within the first 4 years?


IT'S THIS SIMPLE - If we help more Entrepreneurs that start businesses succeed on the first try, then there would be more businesses and more jobs that benefit the entire economy.


Together we can create a new business model that improves the classroom subject they call ""Entrepreneurship"" and in the process help more Entrepreneurs be successful when starting new businesses. 

Introduction:


My name is Suresh but you can call me ""Stretch"".  I am well-educated with an MBA from Indiana University's Kelley School of Business and a BA from the University of Michigan where I was a 4-year starter and captain of Michigan Men's Volleyball team. 
After 5 years on Wall Street, 10 years of Entrepreneurship and also involvement in numerous businesses (here is my Linkedin), I have learned that what is taught to students in classes about starting a business (it's called ""Entrepreneurship"") only teaches a small % of students that follow the ""rules"" to succeed. 
This is because the main focus of Entrepreneurship classes is about how to attract venture capital, not how to start and succeed at running a business. The student is taught to choose their best idea (put all of their eggs in one basket) and work their butts off on one idea hoping to one day land a large check from investor. When the check doesn't come, the business fails. 
Most of the classes are about presenting to investors when they should be about skills that are skipped like incorporating your business, generating first sales, and then only if necessary, presenting to investors and raising capital. In actuality, if given different set of rules to follow, I feel an Entrepreneur has a better chance of success for both themselves and their investors. 
The goal of this project is to seek out and implement feedback from fellow Entrepreneurs called ""Advisors"" from around the world and create a new model with real-time case studies designed to help Entrepreneurs increase their odds of success. 
Please take a look at our plan to change how Entrepreneurs think about starting a business and help us empower the next generation of Entrepreneurs to improve their chances of success (and check out all the awesome perks you get by helping us make history!)
We look forward to hearing everyone's feedback! Much love!



-Stretch (aka Suresh)






My Bullmastiff Pookie the ""Mastiff"" behind Mastiff Ventures. 
Our Difference:
First, we want the Entrepreneur to look at themselves as the ""Portfolio Manager"" or ""Investment Manager"" of a portfolio of stocks would. 
Now as a Portfolio Manager, would you put all of time into researching one idea and putting all of your investor's money into that one idea? Of course not!
WE recommend every entrepreneur DIVERSIFY, just like a Portfolio Manager would right from the start and protect their time investment and their investors' money and instead of asking potential investors to bet on any individual one of your ideas, ask them to bet on YOU (your team) instead of the ideas. 
Now why would an investor bet on the Entrepreneur vs. any one great business idea? Because the type of investors (angel investors) that invest in start-up companies base 80% of their investment decisions on the Entrepreneurs themselves. 
That leaves only 20% of the investor's bet on the actual business idea. We say focus on the 80% (YOU) because that is the main bulk of an investor's decision. And that is the focus of the model we would like to share. 
The Companies:
To create a model that other Entrepreneurs can follow we are going to start a new type of company called an ""Entrepreneurship Company"". 
The more preparation, the better your chances of success so we took our best three ideas (one that is already making money just needed a rebranding), started building them out, and now we are going to combine them under one leadership team and assign Project Managers rather than Entrepreneurs to run the businesses. 
We feel with this structure, we can not only make decisions faster, but have greater flexibility when it comes to changing leadership or making finance decisions ( i.e. if a business is not producing we can immediately drop it no issues)
Here are the descriptions of the 3 businesses:






With three businesses up and running, we will have plenty of real-world case studies for other Entrepreneurs to learn from. Also, we are giving aspiring Entrepreneurs the opportunity to join the front lines of our company by becoming a Mastiff Advisor (see perks to the right). 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SOPTEX
Custom Cloud Software Company (www.soptex.com)



The Company: SOPTEX's BAM software, located at www.soptex.com, combines classic CRM functionality with custom electronic ""tickets"" that deliver the exact functionality, financial calculations and reporting that companies require to manage all of their employees and their business processes in real-time.  Go Custom. Go Cloud. Go SOPTEX!
Industry: The Cloud (SaaS) software industry reached $14.5 billion in size by 2012 and is expected to grow at 17% per year until at least 2018. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bombay Bakehouse
Indian-American Restaurant and On-line Store


The Company: Introducing a new concept in Indian style food, ""Bombay Bakehouse"", an online store combined with fast-casual Indian-American restaurant that will be opened in New Jersey in the Spring of 2015. The restaurant will be based on the style of popular franchises like Chipotle except that the food would be fast and healthy Indian style food. The featured product would be fresh flavored Indian bread (naan) baked in tandoori ovens directly in front of guests. To open the restaurant to non-Indian customers, the restaurant would have a simple menu with no Indian food names, have innovative and less spicy food options, and feature a modern decor rather than a traditIonal decor. 
Get Baked. Bombay Bakehouse. 
Industry: In 2012, Fast Casual Restaurants were a $30 billion industry increasing at 10% per year. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wrap Mogul 
Vinyl Wrap Installation, Training and Sales
The Company: Wrap Mogul will feature a mobile wrap business, a vinyl wrap installation facility, a state-of-the-art training center and a retail showroom combined with online store and distribution center. We have contracted the world's foremost expert on vinyl wrap installation and training to design our process and workspace. Be a Mogul. Wrap Mogul. 



Industry - Vinyl Wrap is a growing industry people are just learning about (you see the graphically wrapped commercial vehicles more and more these days) expected to reach $1 billion a year by 2017. A $4000 commercial vehicle wrap is worth about $85,000 in advertising due to the number of daily impressions. Currently the manufacturers are focusing on developing more pre-fabricated wraps and that is where Wrap Mogul will focus.  First day of Wrap Class was so COOL (my face is stuck in awe). I got to play with vinyl wrap for the first time and it is amazing stuff that is on verge of breakout with everyday consumers. Here is a pic of me messing up a door handle on my first day.
 My vinyl wrap class. I only got into to this class because someone canceled and I bugged the hell out of them to let me in. Soo many people are interested in learning how to vinyl wrap but  there are not many classes available.  The current available classes are typically very expensive or not in a convenient location (ie Kansas if you live in California).
Mastiff Ventures Growth Plan:
Here is how we intend to start and grow our businesses:


 

My Mastiff:

Here is myself and the inspiration for the ""Mastiff"" in ""Mastiff Ventures""- my dog ""Pookie"". I bought her 10 years ago when I decided to become an Entrepreneur and she has been my best friend through the ups and downs of our journey:

When I was seven, my parents brought home our first computer and I began creating greeting cards to give to family and friends through an old school program called Print Maker.</p><p>Since then, my design skills and clever phrases have improved and the desire in me to create cards and keep snail mail alive has only become stronger as well. Through this project, I hope that we can make that dream become a reality.</p><p>The driving force(s) behind Marion Claire Stationery are the women it is named after...my grandmothers. My strong, beautiful, and greatly missed grandmothers are my inspiration and the purpose behind this company. Marion, my maternal grandma, passed away when I was 13, and my paternal grandma, Patricia, when I was only 3. Wait a minute, where did Claire come from if her name is Patricia? Settle down, friends...her middle name is Claire. I wanted the sound of this company to have a strong and sweet name. Strong is Marion, sweet is Claire. Although both grandmothers had a tough attitude, they still knew what it meant to be lovely and to love, deeply. These cards and this company, much like the women who inspired them, are full of heart and sass, which are the two most obvious traits that they have passed on to me.</p><p>With your support in this journey, I will be able to bring you cards that help you and those who receive them create memories, cherish and celebrate milestones and remember that life is a beautiful mess that we travel through with the help of each other. </p><p>Because I want this to be more than just ""my company,"" I have enlisted the printing staff of a local, family-owned, print shop to produce high quality prints that I could otherwise not produce on my own. By supporting this project, you're supporting another; it's a win-win. My designs come to life through this print shop, which makes me proud to present my products to you and your loved ones. While outsourcing my printing does make the costs of starting slightly higher, I believe the quality is worth it. Other costs include envelopes, packing materials, and general startup costs. The reason my funding goal might seem so high is because I'm starting this during peak summer arts festival time and I want to be able to have enough inventory to head out to those festivals so that I can remain in the minds of my buyers through the rest of the year and into the heavy card-buying seasons of Christmas and Valentine's day. By supporting this project, you are supporting various phases of Marion Claire Stationery.</p><p>I hope you will embark on this journey with me so we can launch this life-long dream of mine and get started on making and cherishing those memories!</p><p>Not convinced?

<li>$1,700 will go towards the cost of printing this first round of cards, envelopes for each of them, cellophane sleeves, business cards, flat mailers and various other materials to get this project off the ground during the busy summer festival season. It will also cover the cost of sending each of you some gifts in exchange for your donations!</li>

When I was seven, my parents brought home our first computer and I began creating greeting cards to give to family and friends through an old school program called Print Maker.Since then, my design skills and clever phrases have improved and the desire in me to create cards and keep snail mail alive has only become stronger as well. Through this project, I hope that we can make that dream become a reality.The driving force(s) behind Marion Claire Stationery are the women it is named after...my grandmothers. My strong, beautiful, and greatly missed grandmothers are my inspiration and the purpose behind this company. Marion, my maternal grandma, passed away when I was 13, and my paternal grandma, Patricia, when I was only 3. Wait a minute, where did Claire come from if her name is Patricia? Settle down, friends...her middle name is Claire. I wanted the sound of this company to have a strong and sweet name. Strong is Marion, sweet is Claire. Although both grandmothers had a tough attitude, they still knew what it meant to be lovely and to love, deeply. These cards and this company, much like the women who inspired them, are full of heart and sass, which are the two most obvious traits that they have passed on to me.With your support in this journey, I will be able to bring you cards that help you and those who receive them create memories, cherish and celebrate milestones and remember that life is a beautiful mess that we travel through with the help of each other. Because I want this to be more than just ""my company,"" I have enlisted the printing staff of a local, family-owned, print shop to produce high quality prints that I could otherwise not produce on my own. By supporting this project, you're supporting another; it's a win-win. My designs come to life through this print shop, which makes me proud to present my products to you and your loved ones. While outsourcing my printing does make the costs of starting slightly higher, I believe the quality is worth it. Other costs include envelopes, packing materials, and general startup costs. The reason my funding goal might seem so high is because I'm starting this during peak summer arts festival time and I want to be able to have enough inventory to head out to those festivals so that I can remain in the minds of my buyers through the rest of the year and into the heavy card-buying seasons of Christmas and Valentine's day. By supporting this project, you are supporting various phases of Marion Claire Stationery.I hope you will embark on this journey with me so we can launch this life-long dream of mine and get started on making and cherishing those memories!Not convinced? Read more at www.marionclairestationery.comWhat Marion Claire Needs & What You GetAllow me to break it down for you:
$1,700 will go towards the cost of printing this first round of cards, envelopes for each of them, cellophane sleeves, business cards, flat mailers and various other materials to get this project off the ground during the busy summer festival season. It will also cover the cost of sending each of you some gifts in exchange for your donations!
Those gifts, depending on the price range, will be sent before the end of 2014. Talk about turn-around time!
If I do not reach my goal, I will have to drastically downsize. Because I am outsourcing my printing, I have to print within their quantity restrictions and if I do not meet the $1,700 goal, I will have to print less of each design to be able to comply with that rule. That would cut into the impact I hope to make this summer. With your help, I'll be able to make more cards, which will reach more customers and jumpstart this business in a big way!
The Impact of Your GiftBesides just making me smile and making me even more grateful for the wonderful people in my life, your gift will create a partnership between us as I start my greeting card business. What exactly does that mean?
With your support, I vow to keep you in mind while designing. I want to create something that warms your heart and/or makes you laugh and something you are proud to purchase and send to a loved one. With your support in this fundraiser, I promise to continue to do that.
By supporting this fundraiser, you are literally helping me make a life-long dream come true and helping me to live up to the legacy of my grandmothers. 
Honestly, the impact of your gift, no matter what size, is unmeasurable. I will be forever grateful that you were placed in my life and were able to support this venture.
Other Ways You Can HelpI understand if you cannot help financially because I have been in that situation as well. However, I could use your help in other ways. Please spread the word and make some noise about this campaign!

<p>NOTE: The tiny dog in the Christmas photos elonged to Alexis. She has had the dog for a little more than 1 year, adopting it as a rescue animal. She had just trained it to stay in their yard the week of the fire. The dog's name was Cocoa and loved everyone! Sadly, Cocoa parished in the fire. A fireman had gotten him out while he was still alive but he died shortly after due to too much smoke inhalation. Despite their efforts to revive him, including an emergency tracheotomy, Cocoa couldn't hold on. Please restore hope to this loving family with hearts of gold. Someday, one of them just may be the one who is helping you...</p>

NOTE: The tiny dog in the Christmas photos elonged to Alexis. She has had the dog for a little more than 1 year, adopting it as a rescue animal. She had just trained it to stay in their yard the week of the fire. The dog's name was Cocoa and loved everyone! Sadly, Cocoa parished in the fire. A fireman had gotten him out while he was still alive but he died shortly after due to too much smoke inhalation. Despite their efforts to revive him, including an emergency tracheotomy, Cocoa couldn't hold on. Please restore hope to this loving family with hearts of gold. Someday, one of them just may be the one who is helping you...


What We Need & What You Get
This is a method of those online and on the go or people who don't have time for the post office to help out.
100% of this fund will be donated to the family.

Any amount of money will be helpful to this family as they are starting from square one.
This is a great way to feel good about yourself by loving thy neighbor.
This is the best way to show the internet and the world that there is some humanity left in our race.
Pay it forward! You never know when you could be in this situaiton!

<p><span class=""notranlsate""><span>Hello, I am Anné Mariè du Preez Bezdrob, author of ‘The Nelson Mandela Story’, which forms the basis of this project. It has been reviewed as, inter alia, ‘the best biography’ of Mandela (The Sowetan); ‘a must-read’ (O Magazine); ‘the definitive biography of Nelson Mandela’ (The Citizen); and ‘a fresh new portrait of Mandela’ (Beeld).</span></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate""><span>On 18 July 2013 this icon of democracy and peace celebrates his 95th birthday. He is in frail health and this is a golden opportunity to honour him while we still have the privilege of sharing his birthday with him.</span></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate""><span>This project is designed, through the donation of thousands of books and a holiday tour for underprivileged dhildren, to create an extended celebration that will spread Nelson Mandela’s ideals and vision, and touch as many lives as possible.</span></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate"">The first phase of the project is a special 95th birthday edition of ‘The Nelson Mandela Story’ with a new cover and the new title,</span><span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span><strong>‘Nelson Mandela – A Man First</strong><span class=""notranlsate"">’; and the hope is that your contributions will enable the printing of 5,000 copies, and the donation of the book to schools, prisons and libraries, to share Nelson Mandela's philisophies and in honour of his commitment to improving life through education.</span></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate""><span>The second phase is a historical translation of the book in Mandela’s mother tongue, isiXhosa. As with Phase 1, the hope is that your contributions will make it possible to donate thousands of copies of the translated version to schools, prisons and libraries.</span></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate""><span>The third phase is an audio version of the book, in both English and isiXhosa, and donations of the CD to schools and organisations for the visually impaired.</span></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate""><span>The fourth phase is educational tours for groups of underprivileged children to places of interest relating to Nelson Mandela’s life in the history of South Africa: his birthplace Qunu in the Transkei, Robben Island, and his former home in Soweto.</span></span></p>

<p><span class=""notranlsate""><span>During 27 years in prison, and after almost as many years of political banning orders, malicious persecution and cruelty, Mandela often plotted his escape. More importantly, he also plotted - not revenge against those who oppressed, and committed human rights abuses against, him and millions of his people - but reconciliation with the people who denied him and other black South Africans the most basic human rights.</span></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate""><span>Almost three decades in prison did not make him embittered or vengeful, but convinced him that the wrongs of South Africa’s history could only be remedied by starting on a clean slate. That meant forgiving, if not forgetting, the bitter legacy of apartheid, and incorporating the perpetrators of decades of pain and suffering into a new society.</span></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate""><strong><span>‘Out of the experience of an extraordinary human disaster that lasted too long, must be born a society of which all humanity will be proud.

<p>Through perseverance and the unshakeable belief in the validity of his cause and the good in others, Nelson Mandela changed the course of history.</p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate""><span>The written word is a limitless way of reaching everyone on the planet and sharing the fascinating story of this icon of our time.</span></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate""><span>Long before becoming the leader of the African National Congress, Nelson Mandela was a young Thembu prince, living a life of pomp and luxury. Before he was the most famous prisoner of the 20th century and an international statesman, he was a son, husband, father, lawyer and rebel, fighting for the liberation of his countrymen. His determination to lead a meaningful life and to make a contribution to his people’s quest for freedom, led him to leave behind a life of luxury and advantage to struggle, penniless and unemployed, fighting for survival against the hardship of racial discrimination, to acquire an education and, ultimately, the freedom of his people.</span></span></p>
<p>From a young age Mandela believed in the power of education, not in the narrow sense of the word alone, but as a comprehensive experience. This, combined with his love of children, led him to establish the Nelson Mandela Children’s Fund in 1995.</p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate""><strong><span>‘There can be no keener revelation of a society's soul than the way in which it treats its children.’ - Nelson Mandela</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate""><span>While he was a prisoner on Robben Island he petitioned the prison authorities to allow inmates to study, and established an institute of learning in the prison that was called ‘Mandela’s university’. He encouraged young prisoners to use their time in prison to study and many acquired degrees thanks to Mandela’s diligent pursuit of knowledge.</span></span></p>

<p><span class=""notranlsate""><span>At the time of Nelson Mandela’s 90th birthday I donated more than 400 copies of ‘The Nelson Mandela Story’ to youth organisations, including the Nelson Mandela Children’s Fund; and to other institutions.</span></span></p>

CELEBRATE MANDELA 95
JOIN IN THE CELEBRATION OF NELSON MANDELA’S 95th BIRTHDAY BY HELPING A CHILD HAVE ACCESS TO A BOOK
There was the world before Nelson Mandela – and the world after Nelson Mandela.
‘He is God’s gift to South Africa and he is our gift to the world’
- Archbishop Desmond Tutu
Hello, I am Anné Mariè du Preez Bezdrob, author of ‘The Nelson Mandela Story’, which forms the basis of this project. It has been reviewed as, inter alia, ‘the best biography’ of Mandela (The Sowetan); ‘a must-read’ (O Magazine); ‘the definitive biography of Nelson Mandela’ (The Citizen); and ‘a fresh new portrait of Mandela’ (Beeld).
On 18 July 2013 this icon of democracy and peace celebrates his 95th birthday. He is in frail health and this is a golden opportunity to honour him while we still have the privilege of sharing his birthday with him.
This project is designed, through the donation of thousands of books and a holiday tour for underprivileged dhildren, to create an extended celebration that will spread Nelson Mandela’s ideals and vision, and touch as many lives as possible.
The first phase of the project is a special 95th birthday edition of ‘The Nelson Mandela Story’ with a new cover and the new title, ‘Nelson Mandela – A Man First’; and the hope is that your contributions will enable the printing of 5,000 copies, and the donation of the book to schools, prisons and libraries, to share Nelson Mandela's philisophies and in honour of his commitment to improving life through education.
The second phase is a historical translation of the book in Mandela’s mother tongue, isiXhosa. As with Phase 1, the hope is that your contributions will make it possible to donate thousands of copies of the translated version to schools, prisons and libraries.
The third phase is an audio version of the book, in both English and isiXhosa, and donations of the CD to schools and organisations for the visually impaired.
The fourth phase is educational tours for groups of underprivileged children to places of interest relating to Nelson Mandela’s life in the history of South Africa: his birthplace Qunu in the Transkei, Robben Island, and his former home in Soweto.
‘Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn.’ - Benjamin Franklin
During 27 years in prison, and after almost as many years of political banning orders, malicious persecution and cruelty, Mandela often plotted his escape. More importantly, he also plotted - not revenge against those who oppressed, and committed human rights abuses against, him and millions of his people - but reconciliation with the people who denied him and other black South Africans the most basic human rights.
Almost three decades in prison did not make him embittered or vengeful, but convinced him that the wrongs of South Africa’s history could only be remedied by starting on a clean slate. That meant forgiving, if not forgetting, the bitter legacy of apartheid, and incorporating the perpetrators of decades of pain and suffering into a new society.
‘Out of the experience of an extraordinary human disaster that lasted too long, must be born a society of which all humanity will be proud. Our daily deeds as ordinary South Africans must produce an actual South African reality that will reinforce humanity's belief in justice, strengthen its confidence in the nobility of the human soul and sustain all our hopes for a glorious life for all.’ - Nelson Mandela
Nelson Mandela dedicated his life to this ideal and to this architect of a new, democratic South Africa one could say, in his own words: ‘The sun shall never set on so glorious a human achievement!’

Your contribution will spread Nelson Mandela’s vision.

Thank you sincerely for joining this project and your contribution to Nelson Mandela’s vision of a better life for all.
PROGRAM OF CELEBRATION
PHASE 1
Special 95th birthday edition of ‘The Nelson Mandela Story’ with a new cover, the new title ‘Nelson Mandela – A Man First’ and a new introduction on the history of the Xhosa people.
At the time of Nelson Mandela’s 90th birthday I donated more than 400 copies of ‘The Nelson Mandela Story’ to youth organisations, including the Nelson Mandela Children’s Fund; and to other institutions.
For his 95th birthday, and with your help, the hope is to raise this number to at least 4,000. Initially 95 schools across the country will be identified and each will receive a donation of 10 books: 2 copies for the school library and the rest as merit prizes for learners. The more contributions we receive, the more books will be donated.
If contributions exceed the hoped-for target, it will allow for the donation of more books.
In keeping with Nelson Mandela’s example to encourage the upliftment of prisoners, as many books as possible will be donated to prisons across the country.
PHASE 2
As a result of wide-spread poverty and the price of books, combined with the legacy of apartheid, only a small section of the population has a reading culture; and the number of books available in South Africa’s indigenous languages is inadequate. Moreover, hardly any books about Nelson Mandela are available in either isiXhosa, his mother tongue, or in other indigenous South African languages.
Translation of the book in isiXhosa is a gift both to Nelson Mandela and to the people of South Africa.
PHASE 3
In 2012 ‘The Nelson Mandela Story’ was the subject of the daily book reading on the South African Broadcasting Corporation’s English language service. Thousands of people listened every day, and many wrote to express their enthusiasm and gratitude for this book about his life.
'My name is Themba, I am a student at university doing LLB. I just realised the vital role our father of the nation played in our community, most of the youth dont know about his role.

I’m a student at a high school in Cape Town & I have been listening to the radio broadcast of the Mandela story. I would love if I could get the book. Malibongwe
I am elated to confirm receipt of the eagerly awaited book, The Nelson Mandela Story. I can’t over-emphasize the significance of receiving this book, it chronicles and deciphers Mandela, the man himself, from childhood, his nurturing that set a stage for him as an international statesman! It gives a reader a glimpse long before he became an international state man. It is for this reason that I am making a clarion call for those who have or have not heard of the book, to get one by grabbing a copy and/or buy it for someone special, as a present. It is uplifting and MUST HAVE COPY, I highly recommend it! Pat M
There were many requests for an audio version of the book to cater for those who cannot read, either because they are illiterate or visually challenged.
To accommodate people who are unable to read, the book will be released in audio format in both English and isiXhosa, and copies of the CD will be donated to schools and centres for the visually impaired.
PHASE 4
The opportunity of a lifetime for three groups of underprivileged children during the July 2013 school holidays.
One group will visit the Transkei coast, Mandela’s birth place Qunu, and the monument near the town of Howick in KwaZulu Natal, where he was arrested in 1962.
A second group will visit the Cape, Robben Island and, if possible, Pollsmoor prison.
A third group will visit Sun City, Mandela’s former house in Soweto, and the Apartheid museum in Johannesburg.
If contributions exceed the hoped-for target, it will be possible to make these opportunities available to more groups of children
FUNDS NEEDED

The Impact

We like our veggies from Snows Bend, our BBQ from Archibald's, our movies at the Bama and our favorite teams to wear crimson. We're a a part of the community and are hoping to partner with Kentuck, Black Warrior River Keeper and many other local charities and groups doing good in our area. We hope to be a piece of the city that you will be proud to call your own.
Other Ways You Can Help
Some folks just can’t contribute – we get it - but that doesn’t mean you can’t help:
Please share with others. We know we can reach our goal if we can get the word out.

<p><strong>Our best and brightest</strong> have not been able to reduce the levels of violence against women; levels that have persisted for thousands of years. </p>
<p><strong>Prophets, Presidents, and Kings have had no success.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>Celebrities’ voices have had no success.  </strong></p>
<p>But, notice, your favorite celebrities have tried and continue to try to help. They have used their time to stand up to be counted. </p>

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Here are a few names of the people, famous people, who are working to make a difference.  The names are in no particular order, and I will add the names I missed if you will leave a comment mentioning your favorite activist - I will add their name for recognition:</p>

<p><strong>We have a solution; A new approach. </strong></p>
<p>NOW WE CAN solve this problem together. We can begin the process of stopping violence against women, children, and people everywhere just by working together.</p>
<p>The solution is a new kind of Reporting by a new kind of Community</p>
<p>Your eyes, ears, and resolve, will succeed where so many before you found so little hope for success.</p>
<p><strong>Watch the video for the details but the basics are this:</strong></p>
<p><strong>– Report Problems:</strong> Use our Reporting Services to report Abuse, Bullying, Sexual Assault, Violence, Unusual Activity, Unattended packages and our system will notify nearby people in networks and businesses who care and who will step up to stop violence and protect people.  Together we can stop problems</p>
<p><strong>-Report Good Behavior:</strong>  Report Acts of Kindness, Heroism, Good Deeds, Good Service, we want to recognize these people.</p>
<p><strong>-Report News</strong> and other worthy items of information and interest to people in your community.  Wherever you are in your neighborhood, school, and community report what you see - sharing information creates community.</p>
<p>Along the way to creating community we will help to stop violence against women that is Abuse, Bullying, and Rape, and we will help to stop the violence and sexual assault going on in our schools.</p>
<p>You can be the eyes and ears in public places and at public events.  Your report might be able to stop a school shooting or a marathon bombing, abduction.</p>
<p>You and your network can do what Kings and Presidents could not do after thousands of years.</p>
<p><strong>So, let’s go to work</strong> – Connect with your community using mobile phones and browsers.</p>
<p>Here are the services that will help you make the difference:  You can’t buy these services but they are yours to use for your personal use in building safety networks and using the safety, rescue, reporting, and messaging services. </p>
<p><strong>_________________Services_____________________________</strong></p>
<p><strong>WatchMe: A Safety Service:  </strong></p>
<p>Touch a button when you feel at risk in a strange place or a dark parking lot; visiting a new client or on a first date; up on the roof or getting into the tub, feeling ill or faint, WatchMe will escalate to Rescue unless you are able to report that you are OK.</p>
<p><strong>RescueMe: A Rescue Service: </strong></p>
<p>Touch a button if you are threatened with harm, losing control or consciousness.  Ask for rescue help early and the nearby people in your safety network will be instantly notified and one or more people may be only steps away from asking if you are OK or if you need help.</p>
<p><strong>Report Problems: A Problem Report Service w/ Anonymity option: </strong></p>
<p>Touch a button to report Abuse, Bullying, Crime, Sexual Assault, Violence, Unusual Activity or Unwanted Behavior, and instant notification goes out to nearby people in safety network, business owners, school administrators and other authority positions.  Reports go into local feed.</p>
<p><strong>Report Good Deeds:  Good News Report Service for Good News:</strong></p>
<p>Touch a button to report and document Acts of Kindness, Good Deeds, Civic Good, Good Service, and for publishing news and note worthy items you notice.  Reports go into location-based feeds. </p>
<p><strong>Report Nearby: How many and how close are your safety network people.</strong></p>
<p>Touch a button to see how many people and places are nearby to keep you safe.</p>
<p><strong>Location-based Feeds:  Stay in Touch with what matters to you: </strong></p>
<p>Touch a button to select Report feeds from the locations you care about. From anywhere run a location feed for your home, neighborhood, kids’ school, or run a feed for a big game or concert to get reports on problems, good deeds, and news comments from people you know and others.  Filter real time for the kinds of reports you want, from the people you want to hear from.  Feeds are real time but also accessible by time line on a location-based dashboard: don’t miss anything, play later with instant replay of any part of a feed stream.<strong>   </strong></p>
<p><strong>Group Services: Most of the people we care about belong to a group.</strong></p>
<p>Touch a button to create or access a group.  Stay in touch by sending a message or a start a live conference IM session. Locate one or all group members, and filter your outgoing messages by location; send only to people who are not nearby you, or who are nearby another location e.g., home, office, school, etc.  Group examples: family, neighborhood, school, work, friends, co-workers, as many as you need to easily talk about or reach out to for informing and or asking.</p>
<p><strong>Managed Group Services:</strong></p>
<p>Touch a button to find or reach members of a managed group. Create managed groups for the roles in your life where you have a responsibility for goals or accomplishments, and where group safety is at least important if not critical.  Running a work group, service or sales team, or coaching your daughter’s soccer team means your performance depends on communicating, sharing information, reporting problems and opportunities, responding to unexpected events, anticipating problems and defining desired outcomes.  Managed group services help you look good and produce good outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Managed Group Solutions:</strong></p>
<p>Touch a button to select the solution template that best supports the structure, goals and roles of your managed group.  See more specific solutions below for more detail on the benefits of using Solution Templates.</p>
<p><strong>School Campus Safety Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Touch one button to acknowledge that you are on duty when you arrive on campus.  The Campus Safety Report form appears with the report options for your campus.  Once a report is made the system instantly notifies the nearby members who can respond to the reported problem. Any on campus user can report suspicious activity, bad behavior, accidents, hazards, violence.  The Response team verified the problem, handles it, or asks for more help.  A Dashboard keeps officials informed of all issues on campus with the information needed to understand the threat and if needed, to declare and manage a crisis, including mass notification. </p>
<p><strong>Public Event Safety Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Touch one button services are similar but limited to registered attendees, and reports are directed to people filling the roles defined by the event managers. Fast, simple reporting with a fast trigger for the response teams mean any concern or actual threat is quickly identified, verified, and handled.  Solution template offers fast implementation of roles, reports and responses.   WatchMe services run continuously for response teams on assignment.</p>
<p><strong>Caring Services:</strong></p>
<p>Touch one button for Help or Rescue.  Help calls go to designated/scheduled caregivers wherever they are.  Caring for kids, seniors, or patients that informs remotely or on site has never been easier. A help button, with the option for being specific, informs when help is needed, and can be automatically timed for response or addition calls for help, in order to trigger messages to inform more people, or to further escalate.  Caring services include free video access to the person, and alerts if wanted, all direct and personal or with options for more escalation, including going to Rescue.</p>
<p><strong>Automated Monitoring Services:</strong></p>
<p>You can monitor video and other alerts on our App at no cost. However, when you are sleeping, on an airplane or in a meeting, you need help.  When only some alerts at some times of the day are important enough to interrupt your day, then we offer automation to help.  Alerts directed to us can be filtered, vetted, verified, or evaluated in terms of timing, sequence, how many, how fast, and so on, to determine if your rules and policy want you to be interrupted, you or someone you designate.  Powerful and inexpensive approach to managing alerts for your needs with your rules, schedules, and policy</p>
<p><strong>Live Monitoring Services:</strong></p>
<p>Some alerts in some places need live verification. Monitoring can detect motion, noises or voices, and other sensors report temperature, or the presence of water, smoke etc.  Are these false alarms or real event?  They need to be verified and if real offer assistance or if unwanted offer deterrence, and if not resolved, then dispatch security or local authorities.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Some alerts are from people asking for help or just moving around during the day or night.  These events may need to be monitored.  Live viewing also supports remote caregivers with scheduled check-ins that report activity and well being as well as gather information requested by the caregiver. Live processes also follow rules and policy that support decisions for escalation.</p>
<p><strong>One Touch Write-Once Messaging:</strong></p>
<p>Write-Once messaging systems provide for sending ad hoc Alerts, Messages, and IM conferencing to one or more people or groups, with the ability to deliver the message or alert in the way the recipient desires – app to app or app to SMS text, email, post to social sites or a blog, and publish to key words, even Text to Voice for phone delivery.  With one message reach everyone you know by address, relationships thru other services, posting to sites and blogs, and to people you can address only by interest.  </p>
<p><strong>More – yes, we do more and I will add it as I have time.</strong></p>

Any on campus user can report suspicious activity, bad behavior, accidents, hazards, violence.  The Response team verified the problem, handles it, or asks for more help.  A Dashboard keeps officials informed of all issues on campus with the information needed to understand the threat and if needed, to declare and manage a crisis, including mass notification. 
Public Event Safety Solution:
Touch one button services are similar but limited to registered attendees, and reports are directed to people filling the roles defined by the event managers. Fast, simple reporting with a fast trigger for the response teams mean any concern or actual threat is quickly identified, verified, and handled.  Solution template offers fast implementation of roles, reports and responses.   WatchMe services run continuously for response teams on assignment.
Caring Services:
Touch one button for Help or Rescue.  Help calls go to designated/scheduled caregivers wherever they are.  Caring for kids, seniors, or patients that informs remotely or on site has never been easier. A help button, with the option for being specific, informs when help is needed, and can be automatically timed for response or addition calls for help, in order to trigger messages to inform more people, or to further escalate.  Caring services include free video access to the person, and alerts if wanted, all direct and personal or with options for more escalation, including going to Rescue.
Automated Monitoring Services:
You can monitor video and other alerts on our App at no cost. However, when you are sleeping, on an airplane or in a meeting, you need help.  When only some alerts at some times of the day are important enough to interrupt your day, then we offer automation to help.  Alerts directed to us can be filtered, vetted, verified, or evaluated in terms of timing, sequence, how many, how fast, and so on, to determine if your rules and policy want you to be interrupted, you or someone you designate.  Powerful and inexpensive approach to managing alerts for your needs with your rules, schedules, and policy
Live Monitoring Services:
Some alerts in some places need live verification. Monitoring can detect motion, noises or voices, and other sensors report temperature, or the presence of water, smoke etc.  Are these false alarms or real event?  They need to be verified and if real offer assistance or if unwanted offer deterrence, and if not resolved, then dispatch security or local authorities. 
Some alerts are from people asking for help or just moving around during the day or night.  These events may need to be monitored.  Live viewing also supports remote caregivers with scheduled check-ins that report activity and well being as well as gather information requested by the caregiver. Live processes also follow rules and policy that support decisions for escalation.
One Touch Write-Once Messaging:
Write-Once messaging systems provide for sending ad hoc Alerts, Messages, and IM conferencing to one or more people or groups, with the ability to deliver the message or alert in the way the recipient desires – app to app or app to SMS text, email, post to social sites or a blog, and publish to key words, even Text to Voice for phone delivery.  With one message reach everyone you know by address, relationships thru other services, posting to sites and blogs, and to people you can address only by interest.  
More – yes, we do more and I will add it as I have time.
Thank you for your support.

<p>Thank you for stopping by to look at the Great Tomato Woman's project – part II.  A proponent of Food Justice, my goal is to combine education, accessibility and basic research in tomato growing to help people with minimal space, minimal resources, and physical constraints to grow their own healthy food.  </p>
<p>My name is Victoria Ferguson, although most people call me Fergie.  I have been described as a tomato fanatic --  I have been raising tomatoes for over 40 years and am currently pursuing my doctoral degree in tomato pathology in sustainable agriculture/horticulture.  Tomatoes are one of the world's most important food crop.  They are also one of the easiest to grow.  I believe that a sustainable, organic system in a high raised bed structure may provide some solutions to the problems of community food deserts and increase the ability of people to grow their own food.   This project is being done in collaboration with the Cornell Cooperative Extension of Nassau County's teaching farm in East Meadow.  The purpose of this project is three fold:</p>
<p>1) to demonstrate the ease of growing good, healthy food in this high raised bed system, for people who may be physically challenged, time constrained, or space constrained; </p>
<p>2) to examine the impact of using crop rotation in raised beds as far as creating a sustainable system; </p>
<p>and </p>
<p>3) to characterize microbial communities of various cultivars of tomatoes in an effort to understand the relationship between individual cultivars and their susceptibility to disease.</p>
<p>This system has been piloted in several settings with great social results: one 80 year old cancer survivor was inspired to spend more time outside with his little raised bed.  Another participant, a workaholic with limited time, was able to grow tomatoes, corn, peppers, cucumbers and more with reasonable time input.  Our own nine-plot research field in another location provided over 10 bushels of fresh tomatillos to a local food pantry, as well as edible marigold plants and basil for cooking.  We were able to preserve over 20 bushels of tomatoes as sauce, chutneys, and sliced tomatoes with no chiropractic visits!</p>
<p>Your contribution to this  part of the campaign will help us to meet the financial constraints of ""doing science""- the third part of the goals listed above.  The data collected from the root microbial community study will help us to determine which tomatoes are best for growing in various systems, environments, and geological areas. This then will be passed on to the agricultural, horticultural communities at large via teaching, blogging, research papers, talks, and conferences.</p>
<p> We believe that anyone can grow their own healthy food if given an appropriate system and support, and this research is one way to provide support for the best possible growing outcomes.</p>
<p>The basic research component of this project will encompass crop rotation over three to four years: one set of boxes will contain nitrogen fixing crops (beans, etc) to put nutrients (Nitrogen) back into the soil; the other set contains tomato and marigold plants.  A lone center box contains flowers and plants which attract beneficial insects and pollinators. </p>
<p>At the end of the growing season, the tomato plants will be pulled and their root microbial communities will be examined to characterize each cultivar.  The next year, the tomatoes will be planted in the bean boxes and vice versa.  These root communities will be compared from year to year along with any plant diseases that may occur.</p>
<h3 class=""western"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your generous contribution will be used to help pay for the science portion of the project: DNA extraction kits, growing chambers/racks suitable for a non laboratory facility, storage of extracted DNA for up to four years, and basic horticultural needs: soil testing, either by reference lab or in-house using state of the art tests such as Solvita, pens, test tubes, racks, etc.</p>
<p>The bulk of the expense is in DNA extraction and in storage. DNA long term storage is best done at -80C or below. The cost of storing this limited set of samples for 36 months is about $12,000, however this cost may not be fixed and if the study continues for another year, storage costs will approximate the cost of a capital expenditure in the form of a freezer. The cost of a -80C freezer is approximately $16,000. The benefit of having our own freezer is that more samples may be stored as research grows; we may be able to provide a resource with storage and garner some revenue with the expenditure. This campaign is based on the cost of the freezer and a 'best case guesstimate' of electrical costs for the Long Island area to power additional equipment.</p>
<p> We do have some perks associated with your generous donation -- all of these are created by folks associated with the project.  We welcome visitors to the site once we are up and running!</p>
<h3 class=""western"">The Impact</h3>
<p>The social impact of this work is tremendous: people who have begun to use this system find their workload is manageable.  Weed pressure is lower, the boxes are warmer earlier, water is retained fairly well, and picking the produce is effortless.  Many garden pests, such as rabbits, don't climb the two foot walls.</p>
<p>The basic research aspects of the study, characterization and sustainability, also add to the social justice impact of community food sovereignty.  The characterization will allow for selection of tomatoes that are best for a geographical area, as we will be characterizing these heirlooms and impacts the crop rotation may have on each cultivar's root microbial community and the relationship between that community and the ability of the plant to resist or tolerate common tomato diseases.  This characterization may define breeding goals for new tomato cultivars and breeds in organic systems, as well as providing data on heirlooms for use.   The sustainability aspect will allow for a system to be economically and environmentally self sufficient.  Together, then, these components will give us information which will allow for a less frustrating gardening experience by those who are growing these delectable fruits for their own nourishment.</p>
<p>At the end of the research study, these boxes will be donated for educational gardening demonstrations to the Extension</p>

<hr/>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""color: #ff6600;"">To successfully rehabilitate these 100 colonies our project requires new hive boxes (woodenware), beekeeping tools, <br/>and a vehicle.</span></h3>
<h3>Woodenware &amp; Tools:  $13,000</h3>
<p>Our newly rescued honeybees need to be transferred from their old woodenware, which have been exposed to the chemicals used in farming, to new, clean hive boxes. Each hive consists of 3 boxes (2 deeps and 1 super), 10 frames per box, a top cover, and a bottom board. Five hives are placed together on a stand made of lumber and bricks. In total, we need 300 hives boxes, 3000 frames, 100 tops, 100 bottoms, and material for stands. We also need more beekeeper's tools like bee suits, gloves, smokers, hive tools, and equipment for raising our own queens.</p>
<h3>Vehicle:  $17,000</h3>
<p>Although our Honda Element (with over 200,000 miles) has served us faithfully and well, a second company vehicle is essential to our success. When we are called to remove a honeybee colony or swarm we must be able to respond immediately, and visiting our apiaries ties up our vehicle. A second company vehicle will allow us to more efficiently manage our apiaries while leaving our first vehicle available for honeybee rescue calls. We don't need anything new or fancy, just functional and reliable. We're also interested in converting our vehicles to cleaner-burning propane. If we exceed our goal we can do this, too!</p>

<h3>Beekeeper:  $Priceless <span style=""font-size: 10px;"">(But make us an offer!)</span>
</h3>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">We would *love* the opportunity to train a new beekeeper!

<p>Guerilla Beekeepers is already making a difference by educating the public about the option of live rescue as an alternative to extermination, and how practicing sustainable beekeeping methods enables honeybees, currently at risk, to thrive.

Guerilla Beekeepers has an outstanding reputation for safe and gentle honeybee removal and relocation from residential, commercial, and municipal properties. We are a fully-insured, California state licensed business. So what makes us different?

We keep every colony that we rescue.
We practice sustainable methods of beekeeping.
We only place our honeybees on horticulturally diverse properties and farmlands in Southern California.
We place our hives permanently in one location.


Even though we do all this, we know we can do more. So, after the annual pollination event in Central California, we rescued our first set of 100 commercial hives.
Our project is to rehabilitate the100 hives we rescued so the bees makedelicious, pure, sustainably-produced wildflower honey for you.
We have already proven on a small scale that using sustainable beekeeping practices allow the bees to flourish, the honey to flow, and our business to grow. Now it’s time to prove it again on a larger scale!

Project Essentials

To successfully rehabilitate these 100 colonies our project requires new hive boxes (woodenware), beekeeping tools, and a vehicle.
Woodenware & Tools:  $13,000
Our newly rescued honeybees need to be transferred from their old woodenware, which have been exposed to the chemicals used in farming, to new, clean hive boxes. Each hive consists of 3 boxes (2 deeps and 1 super), 10 frames per box, a top cover, and a bottom board. Five hives are placed together on a stand made of lumber and bricks. In total, we need 300 hives boxes, 3000 frames, 100 tops, 100 bottoms, and material for stands. We also need more beekeeper's tools like bee suits, gloves, smokers, hive tools, and equipment for raising our own queens.
Vehicle:  $17,000
Although our Honda Element (with over 200,000 miles) has served us faithfully and well, a second company vehicle is essential to our success. When we are called to remove a honeybee colony or swarm we must be able to respond immediately, and visiting our apiaries ties up our vehicle. A second company vehicle will allow us to more efficiently manage our apiaries while leaving our first vehicle available for honeybee rescue calls. We don't need anything new or fancy, just functional and reliable. We're also interested in converting our vehicles to cleaner-burning propane. If we exceed our goal we can do this, too!
If we exceed our goals we can expand our efforts even further!
Beekeeper:  $Priceless (But make us an offer!)

We would *love* the opportunity to train a new beekeeper! Any funding beyond our goal isn't expected to pay a salary, but rather to be assistance in covering our costs during the initial months needed to mentor a new beekeeper in beekeeping and bee rescue.

<p>Grand St. Community Arts is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in Albany’s South End. Our building was constructed in 1907 as St. Anthony’s church, when our community was largely an Italian immigrant neighborhood. The church not only filled the needs of parishioners, but also helped immigrants adjust to American life by offering English classes, performances, weddings and operas, enhancing St. Anthony’s reputation as a center for the arts. But in 1972, following the construction of the Empire State Plaza and the demolition of many homes in the South End, St. Anthony’s had lost its congregation and closed its doors.</p>
<p>In 2003, Grand Street Community Arts was purchased from the Catholic diocese, and reopened as community hub, offering programs for teens such as award winning teen film program Youth FX and Youth Organics, as well as classes, after-school programs for kids and even performances by artists like Kimya Dawson, Taina Asili y la Banda Rebelde, Climbing Poetree, and The Sierra Leone All Stars.</p>
<p>So what’s the problem?</p>
<p>Following the economic downturn, diminishing resources, and long untended issues with our infrastructure, we’ve had to move our programs off-site, cut other programs, and keep our building closed during the fall and winter due to a broken HVAC system. Unable to occupy our building legally, we can’t run programs, performances, or therefore sustain ourselves financially. With the building as it stands, we actually run the risk of folding all together. </p>

</h3>
<p>In order for us to operate and provide programs in our building, we need to install a heating system, fix our roof, floors and walls, plumbing, and update our stage equipment. For all of that, we'd need approximately $150,000 total. In this first phase, though, we're asking for $45,000 to get our doors open. This will cover the cost of installing our HVAC system, repairing the walls, and fixing the roof. Then we can operate legally, year-round and begin to provide programs that will give us sustainable income. Your support is integral to this process, and you will be thanked appropriately!

</p><p><i><b>***Consumer and Delivery Agent prototypes available upon request***</b></i></p><p><br/></p><p>Not only does the AMP suite of applications make delivery easier for Customers, it's more cost efficient for <b>Restaurants</b> who will no longer need to worry about scheduling of delivery drivers to meet often unpredictable demand.  Delivery Services are provided on demand with consistent communication and visibility to the Mobile Delivery Force which can flow from hot dog stand to fast-casual restaurant to food truck with ease.  The cost of delivery services is dependent on order value and capped at $2.75 so that there is no need to enforce minimums on customer delivery orders.  </p><p>Delivery Drivers also win in the AMP Network.  Because AMP <b>Delivery Agents</b> operate across the entire network of Restaurants in their area, they have many more opportunities to earn tips than a driver serving a single location.  Customers win with consistent delivery every time they order, never being forced to wait while a lone delivery driver makes rounds back and forth.</p><p>The key contributors to AMP Network efficiency are the <b>Routing Supervisors</b> who monitor all delivery order traffic and assign the pending orders to the Delivery Agent in best position to rapidly get it to its destination.  This position will be challenging and require excellent spatial, logistical and critical thinking skills.  Additionally, Supervisors will be the point of contact for local delivery order issues.  </p><p>The final component to the AMP Network operation is the <b>Community Engagement Board</b>.  We at AMP are all too familiar with the news of violence and misfortune that plague cities across the United States and the globe.  We want to become agents of positive change, incorporating Community Engagement into our financial model and capping managerial earnings to allow exponential increases in the <b>Community Engagement Budget</b>.  The Board will guide the use of the budget to help maximize the return on investment for the communities that support us with their business.  Whether it be collections for food/coat drives, donations to soup kitchens and shelters, support of local community centers, or even sponsoring fun events rewarding scholastic achievement, the AMP Network is committed to serving the public.</p><p>Above all else, we at AMP want you to know that we are about quality service and efficiency.  Between the three members of the <b>AMP Managerial Team</b>, we bring professional experience in Supply Chain Management, Database Management, Systems Engineering, Equity Research on Wall Street, and Direction of Mergers and Acquisitions, all for major industry players in Health Care, Market Research, and Banking.  This in addition to countless hours in community service through church, fraternity, and collegiate organizations in and around Chicago, Philadelphia, New York, and Florida.  As we continue to put forth our best efforts to support our current employers and organizations, we put just as much effort and even more care into building the model for the future of Delivery Services and civic leadership.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><font color=""#000000"" size=""5""><span style=""letter-spacing: 1.440000057220459px; line-height: 30px;""><b></b></span></font></p><p><font color=""#000000"" size=""5""><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/257998/files/20131212154456-Gogo_Where_Money.png?1386891896"" src="""" style=""""/></b></font></p><p></p><p>We at AMP believe that if you want to do something, you do it to the best of your ability.  Since first spawning the idea for a simple takeout ordering app two years ago, the concept has evolved into a family of interconnected mobile apps that will not only give life to the business model, but also provide all users with a fluid and enjoyable experience.  ""Take your time and do it right"" as the saying goes.  However, quality comes at a cost.  We are seeking funding of <b>$700,000</b> to help cover the following expenses:</p><p><b>$657,000 - Product Development (Project Estimate)</b></p><ul>

That will require a greater investment in tablets for Restaurants and supplies for Delivery Agents.  Also, additional funding will allow more human resources to be dedicated to developing the AMP Applications and Content Management System, shortening the time between funding and launch.</i></p><p>If our campaign falls short of the target, all funds collected will be put toward the development of the <b>Content Management System</b> through which the AMP Apps will be connected.  The CMS will facilitate the menu management, route assignment guidelines, performance racking, data collection, payment processing, and many other vital aspects of the business model.  In essense, the CMS is the meat of the layered sandwich that is the Accelerated Market Place.  The apps are the bread, cheese, mayo and chips.  The CMS is the most critical component to the operational success of the Network and is our top developmental priority.  If the funds raised are not sufficient to begin work on the CMS, then we will assess our financial leverage and determine what alternatives would be most beneficial to move us forward given the situation.    </p><p>It is our desire to keep AMP a privately owned operation not subject to the governance of an array of outside investment entities.  Our <b>Community Engagement Budget</b> is a significant portion of the financial model and is not typical of a standard commercial organization as it takes away from the pool of money that would usually be absorbed by executives in the form of bonuses and pay raises.  We do not want to lose the ability to fund community projects as a result of aligning ourselves with financiers that do not share our philanthropic aspirations.  We want to grow to become the big business that acts like a mom n pop shop, never losing sight of the needs of the people that make it a success.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3><br/></h3><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/257991/files/20131212154207-Gogo_Impact.png?1386891727"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>The birth of the AMP Network will bring more than just hot food at low prices.  The expansion of the Network will bring with it more opportunities and greater earning potential for Deliver Drivers as well as career opportunities for Routing Supervisors.  As an employer, Accelerated Market Place LLC is built with the needs of the employee in mind.  The entire business model is designed to maximize the earning potential of the drivers and their ability to earn tips by seeing more customers during their shifts.  Under minimum efficiency, Delivery Agents would earn approximately $8.80 per hour before tips (4 deliveries per hour).  However, increased usage and increased deliveries plays to the strength of the Network and could allow upwards of 10 individual order deliveries in an hour ($22.00 before tips) and more with the <b>Order Pooling</b> system.  The ability to create opportunities for consistent and financially rewarding part time work in any city or suburb is a large part of what keeps us pushing toward making this dream a reality.  </p><p>Aside from the individual benefits of job creation, we know that the addition of a mobile app and delivery to smaller restaurants can be a big help in <b>surviving the competition</b> with larger chain restaurants.  The failure rate among restaurants is one of the highest for new businesses and often its lack of exposure and awareness in the surrounding community.  With the AMP Consumer App, it will be easier to find new favorites since the obstacle of travel is removed the patron's decision making process.  The search and discover process will always be at fingers' reach.  Also, with Order Pooling, customers can try out the new place at the same time as their neighbors, creating an opportunity for a convergence of local opinions that there's a new place with great food!</p><p>Another benefit to Restaurants is that the AMP Consumer App will provide a consistent forum for <b>feedback</b> on their meals.  Restaurants no longer have to wonder why their new menu item isn't popular because customers can tell them while they eat at home.  In no other industry is personal taste as important as with food service.  Furthermore, if AMP is able to expand to serving grocery orders, customers can provide feedback on items they purchase routinely and participate in the <b>Research and Development</b> process by informing manufacturers what is and is not needed of their products.  The easier it is for suppliers to communicate with the consumers, the easier it is to provide a product that meets the consumer needs.</p><p>The greatest potential impact of the AMP Network will be delivered through the Community Engagement Board.  As we developed the structure of this business model, it became clear that the current technological environment would make it possible to achieve significant revenue generation at relatively high profit margins.  However, we firmly believe in the concept of making ""enough profit"" and want to set a <b>new example for corporate giving</b> where transparency and philanthropy are standard characteristics.  Sometimes all it takes to get people to do positive things is to see someone else do it first.  We know we won't be the first civic-minded business, but we would like to become the biggest.  Everyone needs to eat, and AMP wants to see to it that everyone does.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size:

***Consumer and Delivery Agent prototypes available upon request***Not only does the AMP suite of applications make delivery easier for Customers, it's more cost efficient for Restaurants who will no longer need to worry about scheduling of delivery drivers to meet often unpredictable demand.  Delivery Services are provided on demand with consistent communication and visibility to the Mobile Delivery Force which can flow from hot dog stand to fast-casual restaurant to food truck with ease.  The cost of delivery services is dependent on order value and capped at $2.75 so that there is no need to enforce minimums on customer delivery orders.  Delivery Drivers also win in the AMP Network.  Because AMP Delivery Agents operate across the entire network of Restaurants in their area, they have many more opportunities to earn tips than a driver serving a single location.  Customers win with consistent delivery every time they order, never being forced to wait while a lone delivery driver makes rounds back and forth.The key contributors to AMP Network efficiency are the Routing Supervisors who monitor all delivery order traffic and assign the pending orders to the Delivery Agent in best position to rapidly get it to its destination.  This position will be challenging and require excellent spatial, logistical and critical thinking skills.  Additionally, Supervisors will be the point of contact for local delivery order issues.  The final component to the AMP Network operation is the Community Engagement Board.  We at AMP are all too familiar with the news of violence and misfortune that plague cities across the United States and the globe.  We want to become agents of positive change, incorporating Community Engagement into our financial model and capping managerial earnings to allow exponential increases in the Community Engagement Budget.  The Board will guide the use of the budget to help maximize the return on investment for the communities that support us with their business.  Whether it be collections for food/coat drives, donations to soup kitchens and shelters, support of local community centers, or even sponsoring fun events rewarding scholastic achievement, the AMP Network is committed to serving the public.Above all else, we at AMP want you to know that we are about quality service and efficiency.  Between the three members of the AMP Managerial Team, we bring professional experience in Supply Chain Management, Database Management, Systems Engineering, Equity Research on Wall Street, and Direction of Mergers and Acquisitions, all for major industry players in Health Care, Market Research, and Banking.  This in addition to countless hours in community service through church, fraternity, and collegiate organizations in and around Chicago, Philadelphia, New York, and Florida.  As we continue to put forth our best efforts to support our current employers and organizations, we put just as much effort and even more care into building the model for the future of Delivery Services and civic leadership.We at AMP believe that if you want to do something, you do it to the best of your ability.  Since first spawning the idea for a simple takeout ordering app two years ago, the concept has evolved into a family of interconnected mobile apps that will not only give life to the business model, but also provide all users with a fluid and enjoyable experience.  ""Take your time and do it right"" as the saying goes.  However, quality comes at a cost.  We are seeking funding of $700,000 to help cover the following expenses:$657,000 - Product Development (Project Estimate)
Consumer App (Android and iOS)
Restaurant App (Android and iOS)
Delivery Agent App (Android and iOS)
Routing Supervisor App (Android and iOS)
Content Management System
6 Month estimated duration with standard allocation of resources
$21,691 - Tablet Devices
$199 estimated cost per Tablet (cost variable depending on bulk rate and market at time of purchase)
One Tablet for all Routing Supervisors
One Tablet for each Restaurant (assuming they do not already have one)
Estimate based on Network launch in North Suburban Chicago with 107 participating Restaurants projected out of a pool of 238 takeout establishments
Projected count of Routing Supervisors is dependent on order volume, but we are planning to need 2 at launch and add more as participation increases
$1,232 - Thermal Delivery Bags
Approx $28 each (latest price for the preferred bag, down from $32 with the same vendor earlier in 2013)
20 x 20 Insulated Thermal Top-loading bag
 Estimate based on projected need for 44 Delivery Agents at time of launch in North Suburban Chicago
Following costs based upon projected launch with 107 Restaurants and 44 Delivery Agents$2,000 - AMP Plastic Bags to supply Restaurants for delivery orders (bulk rate)$635 - AMP Vehicle Magnets for Delivery Agents$600 - Brochures, Mailers, and Signage$320 - AMP Window Clings for Restaurants$300 - AMP T-Shirts for Delivery Agents$16,857 - Besides rounding our funding goal to an even 700k, this amount is included in the event we run into the (fortunate) problem of having more restaurants wanting to join the launch network than projected. That will require a greater investment in tablets for Restaurants and supplies for Delivery Agents.  Also, additional funding will allow more human resources to be dedicated to developing the AMP Applications and Content Management System, shortening the time between funding and launch.If our campaign falls short of the target, all funds collected will be put toward the development of the Content Management System through which the AMP Apps will be connected.  The CMS will facilitate the menu management, route assignment guidelines, performance racking, data collection, payment processing, and many other vital aspects of the business model.  In essense, the CMS is the meat of the layered sandwich that is the Accelerated Market Place.  The apps are the bread, cheese, mayo and chips.  The CMS is the most critical component to the operational success of the Network and is our top developmental priority.  If the funds raised are not sufficient to begin work on the CMS, then we will assess our financial leverage and determine what alternatives would be most beneficial to move us forward given the situation.    It is our desire to keep AMP a privately owned operation not subject to the governance of an array of outside investment entities.  Our Community Engagement Budget is a significant portion of the financial model and is not typical of a standard commercial organization as it takes away from the pool of money that would usually be absorbed by executives in the form of bonuses and pay raises.  We do not want to lose the ability to fund community projects as a result of aligning ourselves with financiers that do not share our philanthropic aspirations.  We want to grow to become the big business that acts like a mom n pop shop, never losing sight of the needs of the people that make it a success.The birth of the AMP Network will bring more than just hot food at low prices.  The expansion of the Network will bring with it more opportunities and greater earning potential for Deliver Drivers as well as career opportunities for Routing Supervisors.  As an employer, Accelerated Market Place LLC is built with the needs of the employee in mind.  The entire business model is designed to maximize the earning potential of the drivers and their ability to earn tips by seeing more customers during their shifts.  Under minimum efficiency, Delivery Agents would earn approximately $8.80 per hour before tips (4 deliveries per hour).  However, increased usage and increased deliveries plays to the strength of the Network and could allow upwards of 10 individual order deliveries in an hour ($22.00 before tips) and more with the Order Pooling system.  The ability to create opportunities for consistent and financially rewarding part time work in any city or suburb is a large part of what keeps us pushing toward making this dream a reality.  Aside from the individual benefits of job creation, we know that the addition of a mobile app and delivery to smaller restaurants can be a big help in surviving the competition with larger chain restaurants.  The failure rate among restaurants is one of the highest for new businesses and often its lack of exposure and awareness in the surrounding community.  With the AMP Consumer App, it will be easier to find new favorites since the obstacle of travel is removed the patron's decision making process.  The search and discover process will always be at fingers' reach.  Also, with Order Pooling, customers can try out the new place at the same time as their neighbors, creating an opportunity for a convergence of local opinions that there's a new place with great food!Another benefit to Restaurants is that the AMP Consumer App will provide a consistent forum for feedback on their meals.  Restaurants no longer have to wonder why their new menu item isn't popular because customers can tell them while they eat at home.  In no other industry is personal taste as important as with food service.  Furthermore, if AMP is able to expand to serving grocery orders, customers can provide feedback on items they purchase routinely and participate in the Research and Development process by informing manufacturers what is and is not needed of their products.  The easier it is for suppliers to communicate with the consumers, the easier it is to provide a product that meets the consumer needs.The greatest potential impact of the AMP Network will be delivered through the Community Engagement Board.  As we developed the structure of this business model, it became clear that the current technological environment would make it possible to achieve significant revenue generation at relatively high profit margins.  However, we firmly believe in the concept of making ""enough profit"" and want to set a new example for corporate giving where transparency and philanthropy are standard characteristics.  Sometimes all it takes to get people to do positive things is to see someone else do it first.  We know we won't be the first civic-minded business, but we would like to become the biggest.  Everyone needs to eat, and AMP wants to see to it that everyone does.First, we would like to

</h3>The Edible Edmund Alley will be a mini-forest garden planted along an alley in a high-traffic area of St. Paul.

As the garden grows it will become a site for foraging workshops, as well as a source of free fruit for the community.<br/><br/>The project is organized by the North Country Food Alliance, a food justice nonprofit based in the Twin Cities. As part of its mission, North Country Food Alliance builds gardens in urban areas, giving residents the opportunity to gain hands-on knowledge of the gardening process. The produce from these gardens is donated to organizations that serve low-income people, such as soup kitchens and homeless shelters.<br/><br/><p></p>

<h1>What is The Front Porch? </h1>
<a href=""http://frontporchaustin.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Front Porch is a 501c3 nonprofit</a> with a desire to create deeper community in Austin, Texas through dialogue. In today's postmodern, technologically dependent world, there seem to be fewer opportunities for folks to simply sit down and talk about what's happening around us. The Front Porch focuses on filling that void in our realities by providing Austin with conversation driven, community focused events each and every month. Often inviting Austin's greatest minds and musicians to spark the initial dialogue, The Front Porch offers a unique, conversational setting in which people of varied perspectives may come together to discuss the things that matter most to us in an open environment where all are welcome. <br/><br/><p>We're proud of the work we do. Our pub church, <b>Parable</b>, meets monthly in local taverns, and has seen conversations with Texas music legend <a href=""http://raybenson.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ray Benson</a>, Senator <a href=""http://www.kirkwatson.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kirk Watson</a>, media mammoth <a href=""http://www.texastribune.org/about/staff/evan-smith/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Evan Smith</a>, and writer and film maker <a href=""http://www.turkpipkin.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Turk Pipkin</a>, just to name few. Our monthly concert experience, <b>Unplugged on The Front Porch</b>, has been host to <a href=""http://motherfalcon.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mother Falcon</a>, <a href=""http://www.mundotish.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tish Hinojosa</a>, <a href=""http://sambakermusic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sam Baker</a>, and <a href=""http://www.michaelfracasso.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Michael Fracasso</a> in 2014 alone, and will soon close out with a final session with <a href=""http://sarahickman.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sara Hickman</a> on December 20th. In response to the growing number of Front Porchers we've seen at our staple programs, we also started a brand new program this year for young people, <b>The Window</b>, which saw appearances from comedian <a href=""http://www.hideouttheatre.com/about/staff"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Andy Crouch</a> and rising Austin hip-hop outfit, <a href=""http://magnacarda.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Magna Carda</a>. We've gathered a lot of momentum and we're ready to keep it going. <br/></p>
<p>As we enter our seventh official season in 2015, we know bigger things are on the horizon. Our first event of the new year will bring <a href=""http://www.carterbeckworth.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Carter Beckworth</a> to The Front Porch for Unplugged on January 15th. Then, just four days later, we will partner with <a href=""http://kut.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">KUT</a> and the <a href=""http://drafthouse.com/austin/village"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Alamo Drafthouse</a> to bring <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/286986021512067/?context=create&amp;previousaction=create&amp;source=49&amp;sid_create=205113139#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Michael Morton</a> to Austin for our quarterly symposium,<b> Elephant in the Room</b>, for one of our biggest gatherings to date.  Following this incredibly special event, we know we can make our upcoming season our best yet, and that's why we're asking for your help here.<br/></p>
<p>We're asking the Indiegogo community to help us generate even more energy and impact. For <b>$30,000</b>, we can fund the basics for <b>the first half </b>of our <b>2015 season. </b>That would be <b>HUGE </b>for us. <br/></p>
<p>A nonprofit organization with 501(c)(3) status since 2009, we have worked tirelessly out of our own passion and the generosity of friends to provide the majority of our event costs, which have grown to somewhere near $60,000 a year. Now, we are opening our branches to you folks here at Indiegogo in hopes that you can help us take the next steps in providing quality, community focused programming for Austin and the world around us for years to come.

<p><b>The Front Porch Presents: Elephant in the Room with Michael Morton</b><br/></p>
<p>For our first Elephant in the Room of 2015, we are honored to bring Michael Morton to The Front Porch. Wrongfully incarcerated for nearly 25 years in Texas, Michael will help lead a discussion about where forgiveness can be found in today's version of 21st century justice. We hope that Michael can shed insight on resentment and the racial divide, as well as the ways in which he was able to foster a strong, relationship based community in the depths of a prison system characterized by hatred. Sponsored by both KUT and Alamo Drafthouse, this event will feature an interview, a book signing, a film screening, and a Q&amp;A with Michael in efforts to raise the above questions and more.</p>
<p>Here's the two-part events schedule for Monday, January 19th.</p>
<ul>
<li>Noon: KUT's
Ben Philpott interviews Michael in KUT Studios, followed by a signing of his memoir, <i>Getting Life</i>. </li>
<li>
<span></span>7:00 pm: Alamo Drafthouse Village hosts a screening of <i>An Unreal Dream: The Michael Morton Story, </i>followed by the Q&amp;A.<br/>

He spent nearly 25 years in prison and lost his relationship with his son before he was finally exonerated by DNA evidence supporting his innocence, and was released from prison on Oct 4, 2011. Since then he has been a strong voice in holding prosecutors accountable when they cross the line in their pursuit of justice. His memoir, <a href=""http://www.bookpeople.com/book/9781476756820"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>Getting Life</a> , tells his story of tragedy, injustice and forgiveness. The movie, <i>An Unreal Dream: The Michael Morton Story</i>, was a SXSW world premiere and Audience Award winner in 2013. <a href=""http://www.texastribune.org/2013/05/16/gov-rick-perry-signs-michael-morton-act/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Bill 1611</a>, the Michael Morton Act, was signed into law, enforcing openness and transparency in Texas’s criminal justice system and helping prevent wrongful convictions.  </p>

<p></p>On the third Thursday of each month, The Front Porch partners with <a href=""http://austincreativealliance.roundtablelive.org/lmcf"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://austincreativealliance.roundtablelive.org/lmcf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Live Music Capital Foundation</a> to produce <i>Unplugged on The Front Porch, </i>our unique concert experience. Focused on intimacy and community, <i>Unplugged on The Front Porch </i>features a top Austin artist or band playing two musical sets that sandwich an interview with our executive director, Stephen Kinney. The interview helps foster that dialogue that we're always talking about, and sometimes the musicians will have a drink with our audience at intermission to keep that conversation alive. <br/><br/>The concert always takes place in the sanctuary at <a href=""http://www.allsaints-austin.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.allsaints-austin.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">All Saints' Episcopal Church</a>, and it's hard to imagine a space more intimate to venerate the amazing musicians who join us each month. We get the best talent in Austin because we pay our artists a living wage, no matter what, and provide them with a respectful audience and state-of-the-art sound production. Each <i>Unplugged on the Front Porch </i>event is also video taped by LMCF. We hope that they will have the 2014 season ready for your viewing pleasure in the next month or two. <br/><br/>Here's a clip of <a href=""http://www.jimmiegilmore.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.jimmiegilmore.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jimmie Dale Gilmore</a> and <a href=""http://www.colingilmore.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.colingilmore.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Colin Gilmore</a> from last season.<br/>

<h3><span>What do we want from you?</span></h3>
<p>We are asking friends, fellow risk-takers, and those who are moved by our vision to support us with funding. Here is a financial breakdown of the costs for funding six months of our twelve month 2015 season. <br/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b><i>Elephant in the Room</i></b> costs us somewhere around <b>$3,000</b> per event. This number estimates costs for speaker, travel, lodging, venue, staffing, and advertising. <b>Funding for Six Months: $6,000</b><br/>
</li>
<li>Each <i><b>Parable</b> </i>costs us about <b>$1,000</b>. Our excellent musicians and speakers, as well as staffing and occasional venue costs, make up the primary cost of this event. <b>Funding for Six Months: $6,000</b><br/>
</li>
<li>
<i><b>Unplugged on the Front Porch </b>costs <b>$2,000</b></i>. Our top musicians, our sound team, our lighting team, our equipment costs, refreshments, and more make up the costs for this event. <b>Funding for Six Months: $12,000</b><br/>
</li>
<li>Each session of <b>The Window</b> costs roughly <b>$500</b>. Our speakers, musicians, staffing and refreshment costs make up this number. <b>Funding for Six Months: $6,000</b>
</li>
</ul>
<b>If you notice, that all adds up to exactly $30,000. </b><br/>
<p>Every dollar over $30,000 gives us new choices. We always end up hosting a few events a year outside of the confines of our regular concerts and lecture series. We would also love to increase the frequency of each of these events. Ideally, any extra money would go immediately toward six more months of great Front Porch programs, building the rest of 2015.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Our Path--Past and Future</h3>
<p>The Front Porch got its start in the year 2000, when Front Porch director Stephen Kinney and a group of close friends began reading deep into some heavy duty thinkers. Kinney writes of the early days:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""The small group of us who'd meet weekly...expanded to 10-25 people 
who'd read an article, discuss an idea, or explore the hermeneutic 
philosophy of thinkers like Wittgenstein, Gadamer, or Taylor. We
 talked about Colin Gunton's latest book on the Trinity as an idea for 
creating new life and understanding through dialogical friendships--a 
relational practice that got us beyond modern, abstract notions of truth
 and universal reason.  <br/></p>
<p>We talked about stuff that had implications for 
how individuals lived well in wider community. Our...interdisciplinary approach meant we got into social theory and science, 
political perspectives, art and music. Connections between different
 ideas and perspectives were being made, evaluated, or 
reinterpreted. It
 was fun to think in what I'd call radically incarnational ways. The 
world opened up. <br/></p>
<p>Other people became very important for the added 
perspectives they brought to the table and gave voice to. Calling ""the 
other"" into being, sharing a felt communion not in spite of but because 
of our differences was experienced. The idea of building our community 
through such personal interaction on multiple levels became an 
intention.""</p>
</blockquote>
<div>
<p>
Now, over a decade later, The Front Porch has followed its dialogical path to unprecedented activity and influence. Our events are turning out bigger crowds, ranging anywhere from 50 to 200 people at any given gathering. As we look for new ways to keep larger groups engaged in our intimate, Front Porch ideal, we are excited to know that our ideologies are catching on and turning heads. The more people that join The Front Porch community, the better. Each new face gives us more and more reason to pursue our long term goal- the acquisition and implementation of <b>our own permanent event space</b>. Ideally, this space will be a pub/cafe with a venue stage where we could offer a year's worth of programming on The Front Porch, seven days a week. This is our dream for this project, the thing we are always working toward. <br/></p>
<h3>Risks/Challenges</h3>
<div>What if we don't raise our whole goal? We'll carry on, of course. We will gratefully accept and put to frugal use all money we make from this campaign, our 2015 season poised to spring into action even if we don't get near the goal. Still, we hope that our message is compelling enough to earn your generosity. <br/><br/>Risks for The Front Porch are few, since we already have our programs in place. We know what to expect and how to plan them. If you like our ideas, you can expect us to implement them to perfection and with efficiency.<br/><br/>Our newest challenge lies in maintaining our spirit of intimate companionship and community in spite of our growing numbers. The more events we can sponsor, the better off we are in combating this, since it would increase everyone's immediate engagement with The Front Porch. <br/><br/>Another challenge lies in our limited scope. While some of our events are video taped and may reach a larger audience, the primary focus of The Front Porch is right here in Austin, Texas. Again, having a larger budget would help us produce more video content and allow us further opportunities to spread our message farther and wider than ever before. <br/>

</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>If you're stretched right now, you could help us by getting more familiar with our events and programs and spreading the word about us to anyone you think might be interested. Especially share this Indiegogo opportunity with friends and enemies alike.<br/>

</div></div>","What is The Front Porch? 
The Front Porch is a 501c3 nonprofit with a desire to create deeper community in Austin, Texas through dialogue. In today's postmodern, technologically dependent world, there seem to be fewer opportunities for folks to simply sit down and talk about what's happening around us. The Front Porch focuses on filling that void in our realities by providing Austin with conversation driven, community focused events each and every month. Often inviting Austin's greatest minds and musicians to spark the initial dialogue, The Front Porch offers a unique, conversational setting in which people of varied perspectives may come together to discuss the things that matter most to us in an open environment where all are welcome. We're proud of the work we do. Our pub church, Parable, meets monthly in local taverns, and has seen conversations with Texas music legend Ray Benson, Senator Kirk Watson, media mammoth Evan Smith, and writer and film maker Turk Pipkin, just to name few. Our monthly concert experience, Unplugged on The Front Porch, has been host to Mother Falcon, Tish Hinojosa, Sam Baker, and Michael Fracasso in 2014 alone, and will soon close out with a final session with Sara Hickman on December 20th. In response to the growing number of Front Porchers we've seen at our staple programs, we also started a brand new program this year for young people, The Window, which saw appearances from comedian Andy Crouch and rising Austin hip-hop outfit, Magna Carda. We've gathered a lot of momentum and we're ready to keep it going. 
As we enter our seventh official season in 2015, we know bigger things are on the horizon. Our first event of the new year will bring Carter Beckworth to The Front Porch for Unplugged on January 15th. Then, just four days later, we will partner with KUT and the Alamo Drafthouse to bring Michael Morton to Austin for our quarterly symposium, Elephant in the Room, for one of our biggest gatherings to date.  Following this incredibly special event, we know we can make our upcoming season our best yet, and that's why we're asking for your help here.
We're asking the Indiegogo community to help us generate even more energy and impact. For $30,000, we can fund the basics for the first half of our 2015 season. That would be HUGE for us. 
A nonprofit organization with 501(c)(3) status since 2009, we have worked tirelessly out of our own passion and the generosity of friends to provide the majority of our event costs, which have grown to somewhere near $60,000 a year. Now, we are opening our branches to you folks here at Indiegogo in hopes that you can help us take the next steps in providing quality, community focused programming for Austin and the world around us for years to come. Visit our blog post for this campaign here or our Facebook page to find out more. You can also purchase tickets for our upcoming event with Michael Morton by visiting the Alamo Drafthouse online, or have special seats provided if you pick the right perk! 

The Front Porch 2015 Season



Our Symposium


Estimated cost per quarter: $3,000 

Designed to raise questions about uncomfortable truths in our reality, Elephant in the Room always packs a serious punch, and our symposium topics have ranged from human trafficking to the lingering effects of war for our returning veterans. Each Elephant in the Room brings an expert lecturer to a local venue to help stir and shape a Front Porch conversation, providing an engaging, community-focused experience for all who attend.

The Front Porch Presents: Elephant in the Room with Michael Morton
For our first Elephant in the Room of 2015, we are honored to bring Michael Morton to The Front Porch. Wrongfully incarcerated for nearly 25 years in Texas, Michael will help lead a discussion about where forgiveness can be found in today's version of 21st century justice. We hope that Michael can shed insight on resentment and the racial divide, as well as the ways in which he was able to foster a strong, relationship based community in the depths of a prison system characterized by hatred. Sponsored by both KUT and Alamo Drafthouse, this event will feature an interview, a book signing, a film screening, and a Q&A with Michael in efforts to raise the above questions and more.
Here's the two-part events schedule for Monday, January 19th.

Noon: KUT's
Ben Philpott interviews Michael in KUT Studios, followed by a signing of his memoir, Getting Life. 

7:00 pm: Alamo Drafthouse Village hosts a screening of An Unreal Dream: The Michael Morton Story, followed by the Q&A.


Here's the trailer for An Unreal Dream: The Michael Morton Story.

More About Michael


 In 1987, Michael Morton was wrongfully convicted of the murder of his wife in a Williamson county court. He spent nearly 25 years in prison and lost his relationship with his son before he was finally exonerated by DNA evidence supporting his innocence, and was released from prison on Oct 4, 2011. Since then he has been a strong voice in holding prosecutors accountable when they cross the line in their pursuit of justice. His memoir, Getting Life , tells his story of tragedy, injustice and forgiveness. The movie, An Unreal Dream: The Michael Morton Story, was a SXSW world premiere and Audience Award winner in 2013.  Bill 1611, the Michael Morton Act, was signed into law, enforcing openness and transparency in Texas’s criminal justice system and helping prevent wrongful convictions.  

 Michael shakes Gov. Perry's hand after he signs Bill 1611, ""The Michael Morton Act.""We will host our second Elephant in The Room of 2015 in either March or April, and plan to have Gilbert Tuhabonye for that next discussion, which will center on genocide. While this signature symposium series is a very special part of what The Front Porch has to offer, it is still only one component of our multifaceted programming umbrella. Here are the rest of the events we offer on a monthly or bimonthly basis. 

Our Live Music Experience



                                              Mother Falcon, Unplugged on the Front Porch, October 2014












On the third Thursday of each month, The Front Porch partners with Live Music Capital Foundation to produce Unplugged on The Front Porch, our unique concert experience. Focused on intimacy and community, Unplugged on The Front Porch features a top Austin artist or band playing two musical sets that sandwich an interview with our executive director, Stephen Kinney. The interview helps foster that dialogue that we're always talking about, and sometimes the musicians will have a drink with our audience at intermission to keep that conversation alive. The concert always takes place in the sanctuary at All Saints' Episcopal Church, and it's hard to imagine a space more intimate to venerate the amazing musicians who join us each month. We get the best talent in Austin because we pay our artists a living wage, no matter what, and provide them with a respectful audience and state-of-the-art sound production. Each Unplugged on the Front Porch event is also video taped by LMCF. We hope that they will have the 2014 season ready for your viewing pleasure in the next month or two. Here's a clip of Jimmie Dale Gilmore and Colin Gilmore from last season.

Other Past Artists Featured by Unplugged on The Front Porch:  Mother Falcon, Tish Hinojosa, Sam Baker, Nelo, Darden Smith, Will Taylor and Strings Attached with
John Pointer, Michael Fracasso, Terri Hendrix and Lloyd Maines, Ruby Jane,Guy Forsyth and Mary May Love, and others. 
In 2015, we are excited to announce the following lineup of musicians:
January: Carter Beckworth  
February: Walt Wilkins
March: Sam Baker  (A local escape from SXSW)
April: Eliza Gilkyson
May: Ray Benson
Cost per month: $2,000


Our Pub Church


Parable is The Front Porch's experimental pub church. We've hosted at a number of Austin bars and venues over the years, and we're currently settled in the large party room at Scholz Garten, where we meet one Sunday evening per month. At Parable, it's okay to drink craft beer and eat the delicious food purveyed by our host, and its especially encouraged to talk about the things that matter to us. Each Parable features an interview with a great Austin thinker or doer and music from Dave Madden, our resident musical genius. Here is the Austin Statesman’s article on one of our recent gatherings.
NPR’s John Burnett leads our Parable conversations. We have had so many different shades of intellect influence and shape this innovative approach to  postmodern church-- music legend Ray Benson, rabbi and jazz activist Neil Blumofe, public advocate Tom Spencer, adventurer Nelson Guda, naturalist Victor Emanuel, Senator Kirk Watson, journalist Evan Smith, writer and filmmaker Turk Pipkin, and psychoanalyst and Episcopal priest J. Pittman McGehee have all sat on the Porch for Parable in the past. 

     Folks gather at Opal Divine's to hear from Turk Pipkin at Parable, Summer 2014
At heart, Parable is about table fellowship with sinner, saint, and 
outcast. As such, it is a reimagining of worship. We invite all people 
of any tradition to join us for food, conversation, and our special, open-to-all communion at our monthly pub church event. 
Our Program for Young People
                                  



The Window provides a rare space for high school students and young adults where no idea is censured and individuality is encouraged. The Window seeks to  open up new perspectives for young people in an 
environment where fellowship created from the ground up, not the top 
down. Our newest program, The Window launched last September with a program designed by Mother Falcon guitarist and producer, Matt Puckett. Since then, we've also hosted Hideout improv guru, Andy Crouch, and rising Austin hip hop outfit, Magna Carda, as well as played a number of stimulating games that celebrate our differences in perspective and open up dialogue between the members of our growing youth community. Much as in Parable, our youth celebrate an open, religion-free communion at The Window-- usually pizza or something of the like-- in a symbolic feeding of our spiritual hunger and celebration of our community. Singer-songwriter Josh Dodds is our musical director. The event happens on Sunday evenings, twice monthly.

Onion River Sports may be gone, but we know Montpelier wants its hometown bike and gear store back, and with the help of generous souls like you, Kip and Jen Roberts are going to make it happen. Just in time for bike season, Onion River Outdoors will open in May, 2018 in the same familiar space on historic Langdon St. in Montpelier, VT that had been occupied by Onion River Sports since 1974. It will be a busy first few ""soft opening"" weeks, with two big events on the calendar: the Muddy Onion Gravel Ride on April 28th and the Montpelier Bike Swap on May 5th.

<p> </p>
<h3>WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?</h3>
<p>In 2007, I was a producer for ABC News and will never forget having lived inside Johns Hopkins Hospital for four months.  I followed and filmed the lives of surgeons and patients, whose paths cross unlike any other human relationship I've seen.  And yet always interrupted by a system beyond their control, I could understood why both brimmed with frustration at times.  But I took note – nothing put their minds at ease quite like a clear, honest explanation or a simple human gesture.</p>
<p>Education was key.  And that's why our campaign aims to grow a more open, unbiased online space for increasingly web-reliant surgeons and patients to better learn from each other.  It's about time.  </p>
<p>Since 2009, I've aggressively pursued my interests in online content, and apparently so have patients.  75% of all American adults went online in search of health information, but 86% of them preferred to consult with a more trusted doctor.  And when 30 million of those Americans are patients about to undergo surgery every year, the information online that has the power to put minds at ease should not be so hard to navigate, to trust, and to understand.</p>
<p>I asked myself: Was it possible to find surgeons, who were willing to utilize the web for future generations, but as an independent collective, wanting nothing more than to better educate, guide, and inspire all patients, both privileged and not? </p>
<p>Seven world-class heart surgeons stepped forward. And so the Open Clinic was born.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/499079/pictures/full/20121020131809-OC_KS_bigclinic.jpg?1350764295"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>WHAT IS THE OPEN CLINIC? </strong></h3>
<p>Open Clinic is <a href=""http://openclinic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a website</a> for any patient who wants to learn about heart surgery directly from a band of seven world-class heart surgeons located throughout the United States. These young surgeons of the Open Clinic are all equipped with web cameras so that they can easily self-publish their own video answers to general questions about surgery that site users submit.</p>
<p>We’re also a 501(c)(3) non-profit on a mission to build the most unbiased and accessible patient education experience online for every type of surgical patient. Highly literate or not, English-speaking or not, even lacking direct Internet access or not, it doesn’t matter. Open Clinic is designed with these differences in mind from the very start.</p>
<p>What we’re not is important to note. Open Clinic is not an e-consult service where patients can get specific diagnoses or medical advice. Open Clinic is not here to market doctors. Open Clinic is not here to replace clinic visits, but to supplement them in a way that feels human and much like the real thing, so that in-person clinic visits can have more quality time.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/499083/pictures/full/20121020131850-OC_KS_doctors2.png?1350764336"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;""/></p>
<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>WHY DO WE NEED FUNDING?</strong></h3>
<p>For over two years, we’ve built Open Clinic in our free time from an idea to a working online platform and non-profit organization. We're a team of volunteers, having funded everything out of our own pocket, and while the surgeons of the Open Clinic will generously continue to volunteer their time and medical expertise to Open Clinic, we’ve now reached a point where a little money can go a very long way.</p>
<p><strong>If you can help us reach</strong> <strong>our goal of $15K</strong>, then we'll use those funds for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grow the Open Clinic for other major heart surgeries: 1) Coronary Angioplasty &amp; Stenting, 2) Mitral Valve Repair/Replacement, 3) Aortic Valve Repair/Replacement, 4) Aortic Aneurysm Surgery, 5) Atrial Fibrillation Surgery<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Promotion and outreach out to potential partners (patient organizations, physician societies, public libraries, non-medical corporate sponsors)<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Web hosting, site maintenance, and Spanish and Mandarin Chinese translations of the Open Clinic for one year</li>
</ul><p><strong>If we're able to make our 1st stretch goal of $30K</strong>, then we'll use the extra funds to launch Open Clinic for Women's Health Surgery and similarly help all women about to undergo gynecologic and breast cancer surgery.</p>
<p><strong>If we're able to make our 2nd stretch goal of $60K</strong>, then we'll use the extra funds to recruit a talented staff member whose passion for business development can take Open Clinic to the next level as a non-profit organization.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>WHAT DO YOU GET IN RETURN?</strong></h3>
<p>""<em>If you have built castles in the sky, your work need not be lost.  That is where they should be.  Now, put the foundations under them</em>,"" said Henry David Thoreau and as such, we wonder: what if your contributions could literally be the foundations under the Open Clinic, our floating clinic in the cloud?</p>
<p>With any contribution level you choose, the amount will correspond to the size of a virtual 'brick', which we'll use to assemble a digital model of the Open Clinic based on your everyone's bricks.  We have no idea what the final rendering will look like until this campaign is over, but brick by brick, we'll have built together a new kind of clinic in more ways than one.</p>

WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
In 2007, I was a producer for ABC News and will never forget having lived inside Johns Hopkins Hospital for four months.  I followed and filmed the lives of surgeons and patients, whose paths cross unlike any other human relationship I've seen.  And yet always interrupted by a system beyond their control, I could understood why both brimmed with frustration at times.  But I took note – nothing put their minds at ease quite like a clear, honest explanation or a simple human gesture.
Education was key.  And that's why our campaign aims to grow a more open, unbiased online space for increasingly web-reliant surgeons and patients to better learn from each other.  It's about time.  
Since 2009, I've aggressively pursued my interests in online content, and apparently so have patients.  75% of all American adults went online in search of health information, but 86% of them preferred to consult with a more trusted doctor.  And when 30 million of those Americans are patients about to undergo surgery every year, the information online that has the power to put minds at ease should not be so hard to navigate, to trust, and to understand.
I asked myself: Was it possible to find surgeons, who were willing to utilize the web for future generations, but as an independent collective, wanting nothing more than to better educate, guide, and inspire all patients, both privileged and not? 
Seven world-class heart surgeons stepped forward. And so the Open Clinic was born.

 
WHAT IS THE OPEN CLINIC? 
Open Clinic is a website for any patient who wants to learn about heart surgery directly from a band of seven world-class heart surgeons located throughout the United States. These young surgeons of the Open Clinic are all equipped with web cameras so that they can easily self-publish their own video answers to general questions about surgery that site users submit.
We’re also a 501(c)(3) non-profit on a mission to build the most unbiased and accessible patient education experience online for every type of surgical patient. Highly literate or not, English-speaking or not, even lacking direct Internet access or not, it doesn’t matter. Open Clinic is designed with these differences in mind from the very start.
What we’re not is important to note. Open Clinic is not an e-consult service where patients can get specific diagnoses or medical advice. Open Clinic is not here to market doctors. Open Clinic is not here to replace clinic visits, but to supplement them in a way that feels human and much like the real thing, so that in-person clinic visits can have more quality time.

 
WHY DO WE NEED FUNDING?
For over two years, we’ve built Open Clinic in our free time from an idea to a working online platform and non-profit organization. We're a team of volunteers, having funded everything out of our own pocket, and while the surgeons of the Open Clinic will generously continue to volunteer their time and medical expertise to Open Clinic, we’ve now reached a point where a little money can go a very long way.
If you can help us reach our goal of $15K, then we'll use those funds for:

Grow the Open Clinic for other major heart surgeries: 1) Coronary Angioplasty & Stenting, 2) Mitral Valve Repair/Replacement, 3) Aortic Valve Repair/Replacement, 4) Aortic Aneurysm Surgery, 5) Atrial Fibrillation Surgery

Promotion and outreach out to potential partners (patient organizations, physician societies, public libraries, non-medical corporate sponsors)

Web hosting, site maintenance, and Spanish and Mandarin Chinese translations of the Open Clinic for one year
If we're able to make our 1st stretch goal of $30K, then we'll use the extra funds to launch Open Clinic for Women's Health Surgery and similarly help all women about to undergo gynecologic and breast cancer surgery.
If we're able to make our 2nd stretch goal of $60K, then we'll use the extra funds to recruit a talented staff member whose passion for business development can take Open Clinic to the next level as a non-profit organization.
 
WHAT DO YOU GET IN RETURN?
""If you have built castles in the sky, your work need not be lost.  That is where they should be.  Now, put the foundations under them,"" said Henry David Thoreau and as such, we wonder: what if your contributions could literally be the foundations under the Open Clinic, our floating clinic in the cloud?
With any contribution level you choose, the amount will correspond to the size of a virtual 'brick', which we'll use to assemble a digital model of the Open Clinic based on your everyone's bricks.  We have no idea what the final rendering will look like until this campaign is over, but brick by brick, we'll have built together a new kind of clinic in more ways than one.

$5
We’ll send you a wholehearted ""thank you"" email and you'll also receive a '5' brick added in your name to our digital model of the Open Clinic.
$10 You'll receive a '10' brick added in your name to our digital model of the Open Clinic. Plus, you'll receive a high-quality digital poster of the final rendering of Open Clinic as built by all of our backers' bricks. 
$25You'll receive a '25' brick added in your name to our digital model of the Open Clinic and also a high-quality digital poster of the final rendering of Open Clinic as built by all of our backers' bricks. Plus, we'll send you a unique, double-ended red pen and custom Open Clinic notebook, each page beautifully designed as a checklist to help you to transform your thoughts into action, one to-do at a time. 
 
$50You'll receive a '50' brick added in your name to our digital model of the Open Clinic and also a high-quality digital poster of the final rendering of Open Clinic as built by all of our backer’ bricks. Plus, we'll mail you a physical version of any one of the four transformative works that have inspired Open Clinic along the way, in hopes that it may inspire you as well:

<p><i><b>What is bARRRk?</b></i></p>
<p>A sanctuary for dogs and a place to help people reconnect with the world. The Rehabilitation part of the sanctuary will house several separate training facilities, including a psychiatric service dog training area where dogs will be trained to help people suffering from psychiatric conditions.</p>
<p>                                                 <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/878356/files/20140924005319-akira_in_service_dog_coat.bmp?1411545199"" src="""" style=""width: 239.429213483146px; height: 319px;""/></p>
<p>It will also include a rehabilitation area for rescue dogs who are the ones at risk of euthanasia because they suffer from behavioural issues which prevent them from being rehomed elsewhere. </p>
<p>As well as a third training area where low income dog owners can access valued education, training and information.</p>
<p>And last but not least, we will have areas set up around the facilities where we will be conducting Canine Crime Scene Investigation Weekends (CCSI). Where you can train your dog to be a super sleuth at bARRRk's exciting Murder Mystery Canine Crime Scene Investigation Weekends.</p>
<p>There will also be a retirement area at the sanctuary for elderly dogs or those who cannot be fully rehabilitated.</p>
<p>bARRRk won't be just like every other K9 facility out there as your contributions will help us to create an safe environment where we can rehabilitate, educate and provide a forever home when required.</p>
<p>The dogs that come to bARRRk will have access to a hydro pool, a water splash zone, and indoor climate controlled kennels and runs. This sanctuary will be unlike any dog centre you've ever seen before, with a huge indoor dog park and activities such as agility, fly-ball and even doggie painting.</p>
<p>The entire bARRRk facility will be dedicated to maintaining the mental and physical health of the dogs that come through our doors. </p>

<p><b><i>PLEASE READ TO THE BOTTOM OF OUR PAGE, TO DISCOVER SPECIAL PERKS WE ARE OFFERING TO OUR SUPPORTERS (INCLUDING OUR REFERRAL CONTEST: THESE ARE NOT LISTED ELSEWHERE!</i></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>My commitment to you, the Supporter and the Dogs</b></p>
<p>I D.J. Silva, K9 behaviourist needs your help to benefit bARRRk, I need the funds to help provide a sanctuary for the dogs that I rehabilitate.</p>
<p>At bARRRk I will establish a psychiatric service dog training facility. This cause is very important to me as my sister suffers from PTSD and I want to provide her and other mental health sufferers a place of sanctuary, where they can work with a service dog and gain the confidence to re-engage with the community. My aim is to train dogs to work as psychiatric service dogs to help people with mental health issues.</p>
<p>This is an area that is seriously lacking in Australia, so I aim to train rescue dogs to become service dogs for people with mental health issues. This will offer rescue dogs a second chance in life and also provide benefits to the community, and the person whom the dog is assigned to.</p>
<p>Any dogs that do not have the temperament to train as a service dog will be offered for adoption, once they have been fully trained and assessed as adoptable. Training will focus on rehabilitating dogs that have been in the hands of inexperienced owners and in need of someone to change their bad habits.</p>
<p>     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/895509/files/20141001044916-akira_and_3_bears.jpg?1412164156"" src="""" style=""width: 260.391089108911px; height: 197px;""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/895510/files/20141001044958-buddy_on_bike1.jpg?1412164198"" src="""" style=""width: 297.529411764706px; height: 198px;""/></p>
<p>Any dogs that do not qualify for adoption, due to whatever reason will then become a part of the family at our retirement sanctuary, and any dogs that are displaced due to their elderly owners passing away will be giving high priority to live out their years at our retirement facilities, where they can receive medical care and live in a loving and caring environment. Siberian Huskies at risk of euthanasia will also be high priority to give them a forever home, due to my extensive experience with this breed.</p>
<p>I am asking for financial donations from whoever is capable and willing to assist with making this dream a reality and will keep those who donate updated on the progress of the sanctuary as it becomes a reality. </p>
<p>I am running this crowd funding campaign to fund the cost of buying a property near Perth Western Australia and making it our training centre.</p>
<p>DJ SILVA</p>
<h3>Goals for Crowd Funding</h3>
<p>We're asking for a minimum of 500,000(AUD) which will guarantee a successful start to the bARRRk psychology centre and the full production of a feature-length documentary. This covers the purchase of a property to develop and over 12 months of full-time production. Everything other than the purchase of the property, such as building materials, etc, will be sourced for free, with the ultimate goal being a home entirely re-built/ renovated without spending a single cent on the project. </p>
<p>                                      <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/878385/files/20140924011000-pool_house_w_panda.JPG?1411546200"" src="""" style=""width: 331.729641693811px; height: 249px;""/></p>
<p>Additional funds will be committed to making the sanctuary even better. All other resources will come from breaking the NILIF fallacy. If this works it will help break the NILIF fallacy and allow others to follow the same pathway and know that huge things can be done with a little bit of ingenuity. (more information on the NILIF fallacy is provided further down this page).</p>
</div><p></p><h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>Our Personal Goals<div>
<p>Our goal is to provide a unique and enriching environment for dogs at risk of euthanasia; to establish a training facility for people who normally cannot afford training; and to train dogs to work as Psychiatric service dogs.</p>
<p>Our lives changed forever when the movie ""Antarctica"" introduced Siberian Huskies to the world. We learned a lot about the capabilities and inner strength of dogs and have since dedicated our lives to making life better for dogs everywhere, and educating others about how amazing any dog can be giving the right opportunity in life.</p>
<p>                                        <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/878395/files/20140924011519-Akira_buddy_tugger.jpg?1411546519"" src="""" style=""width: 332px; height: 249px;""/></p>
<p>We plan to use our online social media platforms to spread awareness about the need for a rehabilitation/retirement facility, driving donations to our crowd funding campaign to fund the purchase and start up of the dog sanctuary. These donations will be supplemented by further fund raising in the form of the sale of products, such as, dog art once the facility is in operation. This 'dog art' will be paintings that are actually painted by the dogs themselves during therapy sessions where dogs learn to be calm and focused.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to have a self-funded facility which can help as many dogs as possible. We will also film a documentary in the process of setting up the 'bARRRk' sanctuary.</p>
<h4>Short-term Objectives:</h4>
<p>Immediately upon receiving the amount of funds we need we will begin filming the bARRRk dogumentary while we purchase the property out of the several properties we will have short listed. We will begin any repairs and building that is needed to make this the perfect dog sanctuary. Fencing and housing will be given high priority as safety for the animals who come to the sanctuary is of utmost importance. </p>
<p>Large dog runs will be made ready and divided into sections for use by different sized and temperament dogs. A training area will also be constructed with indoor and outdoor training area. The indoor training area will incorporate the 'dog art studio' where dogs will create their own masterpieces to be offered for sale. Part of the indoor facility will also be dedicated to service dog training, to train suitable rescue dogs to become psychiatric service dogs. A kitchen facility and cool room will be established as we plan to produce our own dog food which will be the staple for the resident dogs.</p>
<p>                                       <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/878540/files/20140924024050-dog_food_prep.jpg?1411551650"" src="""" style=""width: 335.736677115987px; height: 252px;""/></p>
<p>Walking trails will be marked out and established for nature pack walks, and a dog water splash zone and pool will be added to the facility. Trees will also be planted for added shade in the summer and an orchard which will produce fruit that could act as a future revenue source by allowing the making and selling of baked goods.</p>
<p>A parking area will be designated and marked out on suitable ground so that visitors will have adequate access to our training centre. We will also establish and on-site laundry and pet wash area, so that our facility has all things necessary for the canine residents.</p>
<h4>Long-term Objectives:</h4>
<p>Following the completion of the renovations and filming of the dogumentary, we will have a premiere of the dogumentary on site and launch it on DVD and You Tube. We will open the training facility to the public so that low income dog owners have access to quality dog training. We will also continue to rescue dogs in need and continue updating our efforts on social media. </p>
<p>We will endeavour to begin running bARRRk with the help of volunteers, and the prospect of offering paid employment to staff in the future. We also hope to offer people the opportunity to learn to become trainers in the future, and also to learn to train service dogs.</p>

</h3><p></p><h3>Education and Training</h3><p>Our primary focus is education and training. We will provide an opportunity for dogs to be rehabilitated and saved from euthanasia. We will rescue dogs to train them as Psychiatric Service dogs to work with people suffering from mental conditions, such as post traumatic stress disorder, and agoraphobia. We will also provide education to low income owners who attend our training sessions, which will run on a gold-coin donation basis for people who hold a health care, seniors or pension card. Our other products include 'dog art' , and in future bARRRk merchandise to be sold online.<br/></p><p><i><u>Competitive Advantage</u></i><i>: </i>Our
competitive advantage is our solid background in animal behaviour and also our
experience in renovating. We are not afraid of hard work and will always
complete tasks that we begin. We will devote all our time and <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">resources to making
bARRRk a success and a sanctuary for dogs.</span></p><p></p><p>                                      <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/987898/files/20140924013227-dogs_enjoying_sun_while_boards_going_down.jpg?1415190079"" src="""" style=""width: 316.252525252525px; height: 239px;""/></p><p>We are seeking a property in a location
along one of the main highways/freeways running from Perth. we will try to
remain within a distance that is accessible to the Airport making it possible
for us to work with not only dogs within Western Australia, but also dogs from
other states, when required. We will develop associations with other dog groups
from around Australia in order to help as many dogs as we can.</p>
<p><b><u>The Sanctuary</u></b></p>
<p><i><u>Training Access:</u></i></p>
<p>Many people
cannot afford to go to dog training due to having a low incomes and that leads
to many dogs and owners not having the opportunity to enjoy their relationship
to the fullest. It is therefore important that there are facilities available
to cater for this large group of dog owners so that they can have access to
quality training at a low cost, such as a gold coin donation, which we intend
to offer. To think about how many untrained dogs end up tied up in the
backyard, never to experience all that the world has to offer is one of the
reason this is important, as those dogs are missing out on the best quality of
life and that needs to change.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">          </span></p><p>                                        <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/987904/files/20140924013624-2000_deb_salem_puppy_drop.jpg?1415190317"" src="""" style=""width: 303.793939393939px; height: 284px;""/></p><p></p>
<p><i><u><span>Psychiatric Service Dog Training:</span></u></i>Psychiatric service
dog (PSD) training involves training dogs to assist poeple with psychiatric
conditions such as post traumatic stress disorder, agoraphobia, etc, to be able
to participate in and access the community. PSD training is an area that needs
to grow in Australia because there are not many places which offer this type of
training. We hope to help this area expand and work together with existing
organisations both here in Australia, and overseas to make it easier for
Australians to have access to well-trained dogs.</p>
<p><i><u>Canine
Crime Scene Investigation (CCSI):</u></i></p>
<p>We
will run CCSI courses where you get to train your dog to be a super sleuth and
solve a heinous crime on one of bARRRk's exciting Canine Crime Scene
Investigation Weekends.</p>
<p>Participants
will work in small teams of handlers and dogs, attempting to solve a fun murder
mystery. Canine detectives will acquire skills in retrieving, advanced control
exercises, scent detection and tracking. They may be looking for explosives,
lost articles, or other clues to help their handlers solve the case.</p>
<p>CCSI
will not be a boring lecture series. It is a hands on adventure with your dog.
You will use your powers of observation and your problem solving skills to
sniff out clues that will sort out the crime. Expect the unexpected! One of
your team mates may accidentally get padlocked to a chair...and only your dog
will be able to find the key to set them free! Your dog may have to lead you
blindfolded through a maze, to retrieve a clue from an area covered with
distractions. But beware, someone could be lurking in the shadows... Will you
solve the crime, or be the next victim?</p>
<p>CCSI
will not take place at a real crime scene. Real weapons, accelerants,
explosives and drugs will NOT be used. This will be a fun weekend.</p>

<i><u>The
documentary in two parts:</u></i></p>
<p>Our
intension is to make two documentaries, one focus on the renovations and
setting up of the sanctuary and one focused on the running of the sanctuary and
the way our training facilities work.</p>
<p></p><p>                                          <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/987906/files/20140924014508-bARRRk_cover_2_awesome.jpg?1415190447"" src="""" style=""width: 297.628361858191px; height: 370px;""/></p><h4><u>The
Making of bARRRk the dogumentary:</u></h4>
<p>It's
a movie!!! The making of a dog sanctuary is a feature-length dogumentary
starring D.J Silva and Trax.</p>
<p>This
Dogumentary will show the setting up of a dog sanctuary from the very
beginning, when the property is purchased, to the renovation and building of
facilities and everything that goes into getting a dog sanctuary up and
running. We want to tell the  story of how a dog
rehabilitation/retirement sanctuary can be brought into fruition and a dream of
an amazing place for dogs  can come true by breaking the NILIF fallacy!</p>
<p><u>What
is Breaking the NILIF Fallacy?</u></p>
<p>This
documentary aims to break the fallacy that 'nothing in life is free' by taking
this idea to the very extreme of purchasing a  derelict property and
turning it into an amazing place that any dog would be proud to call home. It
will begin when the property  is purchased using funds donated to the
campaign, then follow the renovations and re-building of the home and
facilities as we  source all material for free from various places, and
also endeavour to secure the help of trades' people for free when needed. </p>
<p>We
want to show that it is possible to do anything that you want without spending
a cent.  This concept is not new as people  frequently acquire
different things for free, by use of barter system, or from advertisements
placed in papers, or on websites.   We just want to set out to see if this
system can be taken as far as possible to deliver something amazing in the end:
A beautiful  Dog Sanctuary.</p>
<p></p><p>                                                 <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/987908/files/20140924022029-File2265.jpg?1415190587"" src="""" style=""""/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">                                                </span></p>
<p><u><span><b>Opportunities &amp; Challenges</b></span></u></p>
<p>The
combination of psychiatric service dog training, low income training, dog
retirement facility and a diverse environment at the sanctuary, is how we will
set ourselves apart when compared to other rescues. We plan to create a place
where people and dogs feel safe and secure, a place where we can educate and
connect with the public and other canine professionals. We also plan to sell
dog art and other product; all aimed to help make the sanctuary financially
sustainable even if  the kind donations were to stop tomorrow. This will
allow us to run without the financial restraints faced by many other rescues
and to precede with our expansion plans further increasing the security of our
sanctuary for years to come. </p>
<p></p><p>                                <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/987912/files/20140924015742-akira_footprint_in_mud.jpg?1415190689"" src="""" style=""width: 361.333333333333px; height: 271px;""/></p><p>There
are other organisations that offer some type of training for sufferers of
conditions such as autism, PTSD, and anxiety related issues, however these are
not their primary focus. all of the organisations in Australia are also mainly
located on the east coast of Australia, which is why a facility is needed on
the west coast to make training more accessible to people in Western Australia.</p>
<p>The
area (Western Australia) that we have decided to base our sanctuary provides an
exceptional opportunity for us to take advantage of a missing and much needed
service dog sector in the west. There are no comparable facilities that offer
service dog training, as well as elderly dog retirement facilities. We are in a
prime position to fill a gap in the Australian service dog sector, meaning we
will be a unique facility not only in the west, but also in the whole of
Australia.</p>

much a part of the journey as we can. The bARRRk facility will be like no

them to change our lives as well as their own.  </p>

What is bARRRk?
A sanctuary for dogs and a place to help people reconnect with the world. The Rehabilitation part of the sanctuary will house several separate training facilities, including a psychiatric service dog training area where dogs will be trained to help people suffering from psychiatric conditions.
                                                 
It will also include a rehabilitation area for rescue dogs who are the ones at risk of euthanasia because they suffer from behavioural issues which prevent them from being rehomed elsewhere. 
As well as a third training area where low income dog owners can access valued education, training and information.
And last but not least, we will have areas set up around the facilities where we will be conducting Canine Crime Scene Investigation Weekends (CCSI). Where you can train your dog to be a super sleuth at bARRRk's exciting Murder Mystery Canine Crime Scene Investigation Weekends.
There will also be a retirement area at the sanctuary for elderly dogs or those who cannot be fully rehabilitated.
bARRRk won't be just like every other K9 facility out there as your contributions will help us to create an safe environment where we can rehabilitate, educate and provide a forever home when required.
The dogs that come to bARRRk will have access to a hydro pool, a water splash zone, and indoor climate controlled kennels and runs. This sanctuary will be unlike any dog centre you've ever seen before, with a huge indoor dog park and activities such as agility, fly-ball and even doggie painting.
The entire bARRRk facility will be dedicated to maintaining the mental and physical health of the dogs that come through our doors. 
                                        
PLEASE READ TO THE BOTTOM OF OUR PAGE, TO DISCOVER SPECIAL PERKS WE ARE OFFERING TO OUR SUPPORTERS (INCLUDING OUR REFERRAL CONTEST: THESE ARE NOT LISTED ELSEWHERE!

My commitment to you, the Supporter and the Dogs
I D.J. Silva, K9 behaviourist needs your help to benefit bARRRk, I need the funds to help provide a sanctuary for the dogs that I rehabilitate.
At bARRRk I will establish a psychiatric service dog training facility. This cause is very important to me as my sister suffers from PTSD and I want to provide her and other mental health sufferers a place of sanctuary, where they can work with a service dog and gain the confidence to re-engage with the community. My aim is to train dogs to work as psychiatric service dogs to help people with mental health issues.
This is an area that is seriously lacking in Australia, so I aim to train rescue dogs to become service dogs for people with mental health issues. This will offer rescue dogs a second chance in life and also provide benefits to the community, and the person whom the dog is assigned to.
Any dogs that do not have the temperament to train as a service dog will be offered for adoption, once they have been fully trained and assessed as adoptable. Training will focus on rehabilitating dogs that have been in the hands of inexperienced owners and in need of someone to change their bad habits.
      
Any dogs that do not qualify for adoption, due to whatever reason will then become a part of the family at our retirement sanctuary, and any dogs that are displaced due to their elderly owners passing away will be giving high priority to live out their years at our retirement facilities, where they can receive medical care and live in a loving and caring environment. Siberian Huskies at risk of euthanasia will also be high priority to give them a forever home, due to my extensive experience with this breed.
I am asking for financial donations from whoever is capable and willing to assist with making this dream a reality and will keep those who donate updated on the progress of the sanctuary as it becomes a reality. 
I am running this crowd funding campaign to fund the cost of buying a property near Perth Western Australia and making it our training centre.
DJ SILVA
Goals for Crowd Funding
We're asking for a minimum of 500,000(AUD) which will guarantee a successful start to the bARRRk psychology centre and the full production of a feature-length documentary. This covers the purchase of a property to develop and over 12 months of full-time production. Everything other than the purchase of the property, such as building materials, etc, will be sourced for free, with the ultimate goal being a home entirely re-built/ renovated without spending a single cent on the project. 
                                      
Additional funds will be committed to making the sanctuary even better. All other resources will come from breaking the NILIF fallacy. If this works it will help break the NILIF fallacy and allow others to follow the same pathway and know that huge things can be done with a little bit of ingenuity. (more information on the NILIF fallacy is provided further down this page).

Our Personal Goals
Our goal is to provide a unique and enriching environment for dogs at risk of euthanasia; to establish a training facility for people who normally cannot afford training; and to train dogs to work as Psychiatric service dogs.
Our lives changed forever when the movie ""Antarctica"" introduced Siberian Huskies to the world. We learned a lot about the capabilities and inner strength of dogs and have since dedicated our lives to making life better for dogs everywhere, and educating others about how amazing any dog can be giving the right opportunity in life.
                                        
We plan to use our online social media platforms to spread awareness about the need for a rehabilitation/retirement facility, driving donations to our crowd funding campaign to fund the purchase and start up of the dog sanctuary. These donations will be supplemented by further fund raising in the form of the sale of products, such as, dog art once the facility is in operation. This 'dog art' will be paintings that are actually painted by the dogs themselves during therapy sessions where dogs learn to be calm and focused.
The ultimate goal is to have a self-funded facility which can help as many dogs as possible. We will also film a documentary in the process of setting up the 'bARRRk' sanctuary.
Short-term Objectives:
Immediately upon receiving the amount of funds we need we will begin filming the bARRRk dogumentary while we purchase the property out of the several properties we will have short listed. We will begin any repairs and building that is needed to make this the perfect dog sanctuary. Fencing and housing will be given high priority as safety for the animals who come to the sanctuary is of utmost importance. 
Large dog runs will be made ready and divided into sections for use by different sized and temperament dogs. A training area will also be constructed with indoor and outdoor training area. The indoor training area will incorporate the 'dog art studio' where dogs will create their own masterpieces to be offered for sale. Part of the indoor facility will also be dedicated to service dog training, to train suitable rescue dogs to become psychiatric service dogs. A kitchen facility and cool room will be established as we plan to produce our own dog food which will be the staple for the resident dogs.
                                       
Walking trails will be marked out and established for nature pack walks, and a dog water splash zone and pool will be added to the facility. Trees will also be planted for added shade in the summer and an orchard which will produce fruit that could act as a future revenue source by allowing the making and selling of baked goods.
A parking area will be designated and marked out on suitable ground so that visitors will have adequate access to our training centre. We will also establish and on-site laundry and pet wash area, so that our facility has all things necessary for the canine residents.
Long-term Objectives:
Following the completion of the renovations and filming of the dogumentary, we will have a premiere of the dogumentary on site and launch it on DVD and You Tube. We will open the training facility to the public so that low income dog owners have access to quality dog training. We will also continue to rescue dogs in need and continue updating our efforts on social media. 
We will endeavour to begin running bARRRk with the help of volunteers, and the prospect of offering paid employment to staff in the future. We also hope to offer people the opportunity to learn to become trainers in the future, and also to learn to train service dogs.
                                              

Education and TrainingOur primary focus is education and training. We will provide an opportunity for dogs to be rehabilitated and saved from euthanasia. We will rescue dogs to train them as Psychiatric Service dogs to work with people suffering from mental conditions, such as post traumatic stress disorder, and agoraphobia. We will also provide education to low income owners who attend our training sessions, which will run on a gold-coin donation basis for people who hold a health care, seniors or pension card. Our other products include 'dog art' , and in future bARRRk merchandise to be sold online.Competitive Advantage: Our
competitive advantage is our solid background in animal behaviour and also our
experience in renovating. We are not afraid of hard work and will always
complete tasks that we begin. We will devote all our time and resources to making
bARRRk a success and a sanctuary for dogs.                                      We are seeking a property in a location
along one of the main highways/freeways running from Perth. we will try to
remain within a distance that is accessible to the Airport making it possible
for us to work with not only dogs within Western Australia, but also dogs from
other states, when required. We will develop associations with other dog groups
from around Australia in order to help as many dogs as we can.
The Sanctuary
Training Access:
Many people
cannot afford to go to dog training due to having a low incomes and that leads
to many dogs and owners not having the opportunity to enjoy their relationship
to the fullest. It is therefore important that there are facilities available
to cater for this large group of dog owners so that they can have access to
quality training at a low cost, such as a gold coin donation, which we intend
to offer. To think about how many untrained dogs end up tied up in the
backyard, never to experience all that the world has to offer is one of the
reason this is important, as those dogs are missing out on the best quality of
life and that needs to change.                                                  
Psychiatric Service Dog Training:Psychiatric service
dog (PSD) training involves training dogs to assist poeple with psychiatric
conditions such as post traumatic stress disorder, agoraphobia, etc, to be able
to participate in and access the community. PSD training is an area that needs
to grow in Australia because there are not many places which offer this type of
training. We hope to help this area expand and work together with existing
organisations both here in Australia, and overseas to make it easier for
Australians to have access to well-trained dogs.
Canine
Crime Scene Investigation (CCSI):
We
will run CCSI courses where you get to train your dog to be a super sleuth and
solve a heinous crime on one of bARRRk's exciting Canine Crime Scene
Investigation Weekends.
Participants
will work in small teams of handlers and dogs, attempting to solve a fun murder
mystery. Canine detectives will acquire skills in retrieving, advanced control
exercises, scent detection and tracking. They may be looking for explosives,
lost articles, or other clues to help their handlers solve the case.
CCSI
will not be a boring lecture series. It is a hands on adventure with your dog.
You will use your powers of observation and your problem solving skills to
sniff out clues that will sort out the crime. Expect the unexpected! One of
your team mates may accidentally get padlocked to a chair...and only your dog
will be able to find the key to set them free! Your dog may have to lead you
blindfolded through a maze, to retrieve a clue from an area covered with
distractions. But beware, someone could be lurking in the shadows... Will you
solve the crime, or be the next victim?
CCSI
will not take place at a real crime scene. Real weapons, accelerants,
explosives and drugs will NOT be used. This will be a fun weekend.



The
documentary in two parts:
Our
intension is to make two documentaries, one focus on the renovations and
setting up of the sanctuary and one focused on the running of the sanctuary and
the way our training facilities work.
                                          The
Making of bARRRk the dogumentary:
It's
a movie!!! The making of a dog sanctuary is a feature-length dogumentary
starring D.J Silva and Trax.
This
Dogumentary will show the setting up of a dog sanctuary from the very
beginning, when the property is purchased, to the renovation and building of
facilities and everything that goes into getting a dog sanctuary up and
running. We want to tell the  story of how a dog
rehabilitation/retirement sanctuary can be brought into fruition and a dream of
an amazing place for dogs  can come true by breaking the NILIF fallacy!
What
is Breaking the NILIF Fallacy?
This
documentary aims to break the fallacy that 'nothing in life is free' by taking
this idea to the very extreme of purchasing a  derelict property and
turning it into an amazing place that any dog would be proud to call home. It
will begin when the property  is purchased using funds donated to the
campaign, then follow the renovations and re-building of the home and
facilities as we  source all material for free from various places, and
also endeavour to secure the help of trades' people for free when needed. 
We
want to show that it is possible to do anything that you want without spending
a cent.  This concept is not new as people  frequently acquire
different things for free, by use of barter system, or from advertisements
placed in papers, or on websites.   We just want to set out to see if this
system can be taken as far as possible to deliver something amazing in the end:
A beautiful  Dog Sanctuary.
                                                                                                 
Opportunities & Challenges
The
combination of psychiatric service dog training, low income training, dog
retirement facility and a diverse environment at the sanctuary, is how we will
set ourselves apart when compared to other rescues. We plan to create a place
where people and dogs feel safe and secure, a place where we can educate and
connect with the public and other canine professionals. We also plan to sell
dog art and other product; all aimed to help make the sanctuary financially
sustainable even if  the kind donations were to stop tomorrow. This will
allow us to run without the financial restraints faced by many other rescues
and to precede with our expansion plans further increasing the security of our
sanctuary for years to come. 
                                There
are other organisations that offer some type of training for sufferers of
conditions such as autism, PTSD, and anxiety related issues, however these are
not their primary focus. all of the organisations in Australia are also mainly
located on the east coast of Australia, which is why a facility is needed on
the west coast to make training more accessible to people in Western Australia.
The
area (Western Australia) that we have decided to base our sanctuary provides an
exceptional opportunity for us to take advantage of a missing and much needed
service dog sector in the west. There are no comparable facilities that offer
service dog training, as well as elderly dog retirement facilities. We are in a
prime position to fill a gap in the Australian service dog sector, meaning we
will be a unique facility not only in the west, but also in the whole of
Australia.
                   Supporters

Supporters
We
will attract our supporters with extensive online marketing through our social
media platforms, and by contacting numerous businesses and .contacts via email.

bARRRk but they also feel appreciated. Access to the sanctuary will also be
made available to our Australian supporters and to overseas supporters by our
website, special events, and videos. We will try to make our supporters feel as
much a part of the journey as we can. The bARRRk facility will be like no
other, all aimed at showing that animals have incredible qualities which allow
them to change our lives as well as their own.  
It
is going to be a paradise that dogs never want to leave.
                                 Operations

<p>Topock66 is a Historic Outpost located on the Colorado River and
Route 66 at the Western edge of Arizona. From The Grapes of Wrath to Easy Rider,
our little town has been synonymous with Route 66 and the Colorado River for over fifty years.</p>
<p>Chet Hitt purchased the old Topock Marina more than ten years ago
when his vacation home was threatened by developers. From the beginning, he had big plans for the place which included a beautiful hotel and restaurant / bar. He tore the old ramshackle building down a couple
of years ago and immediately ran into red tape and permitting issues with the
Federal Government. He was only able to begin construction of the project if
he put the Hotel portion on hold while we re-engineered the property. The NEW Topock66 Restaurant / Bar / Entertainment Complex was opened just over a year ago, and we are now
ready to proceed on the rest of the project.</p>
<p>By reinvesting profits from the first phase, we have
increased our equity and decreased the amount that our bank needs to fund the
project from six million to one million dollars. This is where we need your help.</p>
<p>We thought about bringing in more investors, but when Chet came across this “Crowdfunding” thing, he got really excited. What better way to raise the funds than to give our customers the opportunity to get a real value and some cool perks for helping us with their contributions?<br/></p>
<p>We are breaking our one million dollar ($1,000,000) goal down into three campaigns to make our goals more attainable, as well as to provide for more participation from our guests and friends.<br/></p>
<p>This first Campaign's goal is to raise two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) which will pay for plans, permits and fees and get us closer to the amount the bank needs to fund the rest of the project.</p>

<p>With any project of this size, there are always challenges. However, in the three years since we began construction of the restaurant and bar we have encountered our fair share of them (Arizona's crazy weather, over-zealous State and Federal agencies, the list goes on) and worked our way through each and every one. Our team can do anything they set their minds to!</p>

</div></div>","Topock66 is a Historic Outpost located on the Colorado River and
Route 66 at the Western edge of Arizona. From The Grapes of Wrath to Easy Rider,
our little town has been synonymous with Route 66 and the Colorado River for over fifty years.
Chet Hitt purchased the old Topock Marina more than ten years ago
when his vacation home was threatened by developers. From the beginning, he had big plans for the place which included a beautiful hotel and restaurant / bar. He tore the old ramshackle building down a couple
of years ago and immediately ran into red tape and permitting issues with the
Federal Government. He was only able to begin construction of the project if
he put the Hotel portion on hold while we re-engineered the property. The NEW Topock66 Restaurant / Bar / Entertainment Complex was opened just over a year ago, and we are now
ready to proceed on the rest of the project.
By reinvesting profits from the first phase, we have
increased our equity and decreased the amount that our bank needs to fund the
project from six million to one million dollars. This is where we need your help.
We thought about bringing in more investors, but when Chet came across this “Crowdfunding” thing, he got really excited. What better way to raise the funds than to give our customers the opportunity to get a real value and some cool perks for helping us with their contributions?
We are breaking our one million dollar ($1,000,000) goal down into three campaigns to make our goals more attainable, as well as to provide for more participation from our guests and friends.
This first Campaign's goal is to raise two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) which will pay for plans, permits and fees and get us closer to the amount the bank needs to fund the rest of the project.








We have a super cool place
that is the perfect vacation spot for families or groups of friends. We would
like to offer you a terrific deal on rooms in the New Hotel in exchange for
your contribution (Hotel estimated completion date/grand opening is 2016).
On this page, you see offers for single room nights that can
be combined to create a nice little vacation. We also have some super packages
for those among you who want to bring a group out and party in our fabulous bars and pool! Many of our regular customers have expressed an interest
in being a part of our new VIP Founders Club, and that opportunity is available
as well. 


Founders Club
Membership begins January 1, 2015 and expires One Year after Opening of Hotel.


RiverClub Membership for One

Founders Club Membership Card good for: 


 15% Discount on merchandise in the RiverStore


 10 Free Breakfasts per year in the River Restaurant

Name engraved on Founders Club Wall (Temporary Wall to begin
construction Jan. 1, 2015. Will be moved into RiverClub upon completion of the
Hotel)

Founders Club T-Shirt

Founders Club Baseball Hat

4 Boat Launches per season

Invitation to exclusive Founders Party each summer













If for some reason we don't reach or goal of one million dollars ($1,000,000) We will allow outside investors to make up the difference ensuring that the Hotel project will reach completion.  








With any project of this size, there are always challenges. However, in the three years since we began construction of the restaurant and bar we have encountered our fair share of them (Arizona's crazy weather, over-zealous State and Federal agencies, the list goes on) and worked our way through each and every one. Our team can do anything they set their minds to!







We would really appreciate your support in spreading the word among your friends. Indiegogo has some great sharing tools and we are very active on Facebook. If you could make some noise on our behalf we would love to send you a token of our appreciation, so... if 5 of your friends contribute to our cause at any level, we're going to send you a VERY limited edition Topock66 VIP Button-Up Shirt. It's going to look bad-ass on you!! Be sure to be logged in to Indiegogo before you share so you will be credited for your referrals.






As you can see, we have some really nice perks for your contribution. Once this campaign ends, you will hear from us with details about redeeming your gifts once the hotel is completed.
All of the Lodging Perks are based upon availability (of course) and are not available on holiday weekends (Laughlin River Run, Memorial Day, 4th of July, Labor Day). In addition, the usual taxes and other fees will apply.",20.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>About Amor Fitness &amp; Nutrition</strong></p>
<p>Amor Fitness &amp; Nutrition is family-owned and operated in
Austell, Georgia. Since our company opened its doors in 2011, we’ve treated
every customer like family. Other companies may offer similar services, but our
services are the best, and come with a personal touch.  </p>
<p>Our slogan is ""Love Your Body"" and our goal is to
teach our clients how to achieve their goals through fitness &amp;
nutrition.  We offer the services to help
guide you in achieving those goals--whether your goal is to lose a few pounds,
gain muscle tone, have better health, or compete in fitness or body building
competitions.</p>
<p><strong>About Adele</strong></p>
<p>My passion is to help others achieve their fitness goals by
improving their overall health and confidence. My specialties are weight loss,
lean muscle building, improving client endurance and coaching competitive
athletes. My love for weight lifting and nutrition started in high school,
which sparked my interest for competing as a natural bodybuilder and I continue
to compete now well into my 40’s. 
Proving that age is just a number, I hope to serve as motivation for my
clients. I encourage them that they can go after their dreams and goals. And
with my assistance, they can achieve and exceed them.</p>
<p><strong>About the Campaign</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps my first love was hair. Since 1992, I have worked in
the most prestigious salons in Atlanta (Carter Barnes, Don Shaw, Van Michaels),
behind the scenes at fashion shoots, and was an owner of my own salon for five
years. Pursuing my other dream of being a personal trainer and coach has been
beyond rewarding, but I've realized that I can combine my two talents.  With your support, I can offer my awesome
clients a total package. While they have come to rely on the best training and nutrition
coaching, I would be able to provide clients, both current and future, with
fabulous hair. As a licensed cosmetologist, I specialize in precision cuts,
single-process color, and foil highlights. If the campaign is funded, I will be
able to begin and complete renovations to our facility, purchase the needed
equipment (styling chair, shampoo bowl chair, and dryer chair), tools
(hairdryer, irons, brushes, shears, and apron), and supplies (color, bleach,
foils, shampoos, conditioners, and styling products).</p>
<p>After working with so many dedicated and driven clients who
achieved their goals, I noticed a surge in their confidences and a real desire
to change up their look (hair and fashion). 
I thought adding a salon would be such a needed service and one that is
quite unique from other fitness centers and personal training facilities. Including
a salon at Amor Fitness and Nutrition will, no doubt, cause these confidences to
soar. I very much appreciate your support in my next endeavor. </p>

<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>As a small business owner, it can be challenging to receive funding
for starting up. While getting my business started, I was also working another
full-time job along with the financial support of my husband. We used all of
our personal cash and credit to purchase everything and maintain the business
expenses. The business grew very quickly. We started in a 450 sq. foot space
and moved into a 2,000 sq. foot space after the first five months. After
another year we had so many clients that we needed more space for have private
offices for consults, a lobby, a second bathroom and the opportunity to add
more services. Our facility is now 3,000 sq. feet. We continue to be successful, but since we have tripled our rent and expenses, the business is just able to
pay for itself. I am certain that adding a salon will help bring in more
revenue so that I may be able to pay myself and make a profit, allowing the business to continue to grow. With the help of your donations I will be able to make
this happen while also gaining new clients.</p>

get the salon equipped and operating. This can be challenging since we
have slow seasons throughout the year with the fitness business, and the revenue

<p><b>The Sunbudz Story</b></p>
<p>My name is Candice Berube, founder and creator of Sunbudz, a detachable sunglass product for children.  Two years ago, my daughter was diagnosed with a genetic disorder that left her legally blind and wearing glasses for the rest of her life.  Being a normal, precocious, school-age girl, she loves everything pink, purple and sparkly!  And, in the summer months, the glittery sunglasses in the department stores call her name!</p>
<p>So, we have bought the sunglasses and she has proceeded to wear both her glasses AND sunglasses at the same time.  Not a very practical solution, I felt that there REALLY must be another option for her. I searched the Internet and was shocked to find that the only alternatives were expensive prescription sunglasses, transition lenses, or adult clip-ons.  </p>
<p>Upon further research, I found that 25% of children, from grades K through 6, wear glasses!  Additionally, ophthalmologists struggle with how to help their young patients with sun protection!  At this point, my mission became clear: to create a detachable, FUN, sunglass option for all children who wear glasses, so that they can be just like every other child out there! And, so, Sunbudz was born!</p>
<p><b>What ARE Sunbudz???</b></p>
<p>Sunbudz is patent-pending and, thus far, has been designed by me.  I literally conceptualized how they should look &amp; function and then just made them! However, we have now hired an amazing design firm (who has designed for Crayola, Fisher Price, Creativity, and many other brands) and have a stellar executive team.</p>
<p>We are looking to raise $6,000 in order to contract the design firm, continue enhancing the prototype, and fund initial operational and legal fees.  Should we raise more funds, then we would begin building the website and manufacturing our initial inventory.</p>
<p><strong>Now, the fun stuff: what's in it for you?</strong></p>
<p>1.  Continue $1 - Donate $1.00+ and help us bring Sunbudz to market! Thank you for your support because every little bit helps!</p>
<p>2.  Contribute $25 - Thank you for your support!  You will be publicly thanked on our Sunbudz Facebook page.</p>
<p>3.  Contribute $50 -  Receive your own pair of Sunbudz (delivery contingent upon inventory completion). You will be publicly thanked on our Facebook page!</p>
<p>4.  Contribute $100 - You will be publicly thanked on our Facebook page AND you will receive a personal thank you note from Delainey &amp; our family.</p>
<p>5.  Contribute $500 - You will be publicly thanked on our Facebook page, receive a personal thank you note from Delainey, and earn exclusive naming rights on an early Sunbudz design!</p>
<p>6.  Contribute $1000 -  You will be publicly thanked on our Facebook page, receive a personal thank you note from Delainey, earn exclusive naming rights on an early Sunbudz design, and receive an exclusive, in-person (or Skype) tour of our CT design facility and preview of our prototype!</p>
<p>My vision is to have Sunbudz in every major department store and optician's office across the United States.  I feel strongly that we design the product of the highest quality material  - we will not stop until we have it right!</p>
<p>I'm excited and I hope you are, too!  If we are successful in raising the necessary funds, then all children who wear glasses WILL be like every other child, with amazingly fun sunglasses.  No one will even be able to tell that they are wearing glasses!  I see a very sparkly &amp; colorful sunglass future for all our glasses-wearing friends!</p>

Upon further research, I found that 25% of children, from grades K through 6, wear glasses!  Additionally, ophthalmologists struggle with how to help their young patients with sun protection!  At this point, my mission became clear: to create a detachable, FUN, sunglass option for all children who wear glasses, so that they can be just like every other child out there! And, so, Sunbudz was born!
What ARE Sunbudz???
Sunbudz is patent-pending and, thus far, has been designed by me.  I literally conceptualized how they should look & function and then just made them! However, we have now hired an amazing design firm (who has designed for Crayola, Fisher Price, Creativity, and many other brands) and have a stellar executive team.
We are looking to raise $6,000 in order to contract the design firm, continue enhancing the prototype, and fund initial operational and legal fees.  Should we raise more funds, then we would begin building the website and manufacturing our initial inventory.
Now, the fun stuff: what's in it for you?
1.  Continue $1 - Donate $1.00+ and help us bring Sunbudz to market! Thank you for your support because every little bit helps!
2.  Contribute $25 - Thank you for your support!  You will be publicly thanked on our Sunbudz Facebook page.
3.  Contribute $50 -  Receive your own pair of Sunbudz (delivery contingent upon inventory completion). You will be publicly thanked on our Facebook page!
4.  Contribute $100 - You will be publicly thanked on our Facebook page AND you will receive a personal thank you note from Delainey & our family.
5.  Contribute $500 - You will be publicly thanked on our Facebook page, receive a personal thank you note from Delainey, and earn exclusive naming rights on an early Sunbudz design!
6.  Contribute $1000 -  You will be publicly thanked on our Facebook page, receive a personal thank you note from Delainey, earn exclusive naming rights on an early Sunbudz design, and receive an exclusive, in-person (or Skype) tour of our CT design facility and preview of our prototype!
My vision is to have Sunbudz in every major department store and optician's office across the United States.  I feel strongly that we design the product of the highest quality material  - we will not stop until we have it right!
I'm excited and I hope you are, too!  If we are successful in raising the necessary funds, then all children who wear glasses WILL be like every other child, with amazingly fun sunglasses.  No one will even be able to tell that they are wearing glasses!  I see a very sparkly & colorful sunglass future for all our glasses-wearing friends!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

We ask that you forgive any errors, reserve judgement or criticism until thoroughly reviewed as this is a DIY project. Return often to this site as there will be updates and more visuals added to the gallery regularly, as well as a short, annoying video. No professionals or animals were used in the making of this presentation)!  </span></p><h3>Why Us?</h3><p>For more than twenty years, through the non-profit social service community, Cheryl Alexander and her colleagues, have been providing families in San Diego supportive and enlivening ways to enhance family relationships or mend broken ties.  By offering classes, workshops and individual counseling parents gained confidence while learning valuable skills to support their children's well-being.  With backgrounds in adult and teen education, counseling and communications their combined knowledge of healthy family dynamics makes them experts in this field. <b> Family Court</b> of San Diego has acknowledged this expertise by recommending their services to families going through the reunification process after recovery or difficult custody issues.  </p><h3>What are the services?</h3><p>* Supervised Visitation for parents with their children</p><p>* Parent Education for better understanding of child development and family dynamics</p><p>* Individual and Family Counseling </p><p>* Mediation</p><p>* Workshops for Teen Parents </p><p>* English and Spanish speaking facilitators</p><p><br/></p><h2>Why This Project &amp; Why It Matters</h2><p>These services are court sanctioned.  Cheryl and her colleagues receive many calls from families who are in the process of reunification (when children have been moved into foster care for reasons of health and safety there is a process the court requires them to follow, that may take a year or more to regain custody of their children; sometimes there is just a tough custody case that needs court intervention).  Many of the parents who request services are struggling with recovery or divorce issues and are unable to pay the fees associated with the process.  Unfortunately, Family Court is mandating a process without funding it, so parents who are unable to pay for the process to put their family back together again struggle even more. <strong> Families belong together</strong> and sometimes the stresses of modern day living create challenges larger than parents are capable of managing.   Your generous contributions to this campaign can provide support or reunification for 40-60 families!</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">This project matters because every year in San Diego County alone, there are more than 3700 children living in ""out of home care"" (Foster or Kindred care). And everyone is aware that the divorce/separation rate in America is well above 50%.</span><br/></p><p><strong>FAMILIES ARE VITAL TO A HEALTHY COMMUNITY!</strong></p><p><strong>FAMILIES NEED TO BE TOGETHER!</strong></p><p><strong>FAMILIES OFTEN NEED HELP LEARNING HOW TO BE TOGETHER</strong>!</p><h2>
<br/>What We Need &amp; What You Get!</h2><p>We need $25,000 to serve 40-60 families.  You get to feel good about helping parents and children reunite.  And you get to be acknowledged for your participation. You get a healthier, stronger community.</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Check out our perks!</span></p><h2>Here's how you can help:</h2><p>* Give us your money! (Give as much or as little as you like.  We only made suggestions). Save up your Starbucks coffee dollars for a week; skip that trip to the wine bar tonight; eat dinner in for a change; cancel your European vacation (OK, that may be a little extreme)!</p><p>* Sell your prized record collection from the '60's and be our only contributor (we don't mind having just one contributor, REALLY!.</p><p>* Don't' want to give us your money???

We ask that you forgive any errors, reserve judgement or criticism until thoroughly reviewed as this is a DIY project. Return often to this site as there will be updates and more visuals added to the gallery regularly, as well as a short, annoying video. No professionals or animals were used in the making of this presentation)!  Why Us?For more than twenty years, through the non-profit social service community, Cheryl Alexander and her colleagues, have been providing families in San Diego supportive and enlivening ways to enhance family relationships or mend broken ties.  By offering classes, workshops and individual counseling parents gained confidence while learning valuable skills to support their children's well-being.  With backgrounds in adult and teen education, counseling and communications their combined knowledge of healthy family dynamics makes them experts in this field.  Family Court of San Diego has acknowledged this expertise by recommending their services to families going through the reunification process after recovery or difficult custody issues.  What are the services?* Supervised Visitation for parents with their children* Parent Education for better understanding of child development and family dynamics* Individual and Family Counseling * Mediation* Workshops for Teen Parents * English and Spanish speaking facilitatorsWhy This Project & Why It MattersThese services are court sanctioned.  Cheryl and her colleagues receive many calls from families who are in the process of reunification (when children have been moved into foster care for reasons of health and safety there is a process the court requires them to follow, that may take a year or more to regain custody of their children; sometimes there is just a tough custody case that needs court intervention).  Many of the parents who request services are struggling with recovery or divorce issues and are unable to pay the fees associated with the process.  Unfortunately, Family Court is mandating a process without funding it, so parents who are unable to pay for the process to put their family back together again struggle even more.  Families belong together and sometimes the stresses of modern day living create challenges larger than parents are capable of managing.   Your generous contributions to this campaign can provide support or reunification for 40-60 families!This project matters because every year in San Diego County alone, there are more than 3700 children living in ""out of home care"" (Foster or Kindred care). And everyone is aware that the divorce/separation rate in America is well above 50%.FAMILIES ARE VITAL TO A HEALTHY COMMUNITY!FAMILIES NEED TO BE TOGETHER!FAMILIES OFTEN NEED HELP LEARNING HOW TO BE TOGETHER!
What We Need & What You Get!We need $25,000 to serve 40-60 families.  You get to feel good about helping parents and children reunite.  And you get to be acknowledged for your participation. You get a healthier, stronger community.Check out our perks!Here's how you can help:* Give us your money! (Give as much or as little as you like.  We only made suggestions). Save up your Starbucks coffee dollars for a week; skip that trip to the wine bar tonight; eat dinner in for a change; cancel your European vacation (OK, that may be a little extreme)!* Sell your prized record collection from the '60's and be our only contributor (we don't mind having just one contributor, REALLY!.* Don't' want to give us your money??? That's fine, too. Instead, you can tell all your friends, acquaintances, neighbors, besties, colleagues, relatives and social media buddies to give us their money!  Don't be shy.  This is important for creating and maintaining a healthy community.  This important project for increasing the health of families reduces child abuse and domestic violence.

But What Does it Cost?</b></span></h1><p>Right now, we’ve got three different levels of membership. </p><ul>
<li><p>Our “Basic” membership includes one item per week. </p></li>
<li><p>The “Twice as Nice” membership includes two items per week. </p></li>
<li><p>Finally, “Outdoor Enthusiast includes four items per week. </p></li>
</ul><p>We’re still a new company and will be fully operational in early July 2014. As a way to say “Thank You” to all our early adopters who get a membership through IndieGoGo, we’re offering all three memberships at 50% off! So once July rolls around, Basic Membership costs everybody else $200 per year, but everyone here gets it for at least $100. </p><p>But we’re not even slowing down there, let alone stopping! As part of the deal, exclusively available through IndieGoGo, we will guarantee your membership price for life! That’s right, no matter what else happens in the future, as long as you keep renewing the membership you buy with us here today on IndieGoGo, it will never go up in price. </p><p>These deals are <b style=""font-style: italic;"">exclusive</b> to IndieGoGo! The deals will never again be as good after our campaign here ends.</p><h1><b>Price Comparison</b></h1><p></p><p>We want to make sure you know how great this deal is, so here's a quick example. Let's say you went on four trips requiring equipment rental: </p><p><b><u>Trip 1</u></b>: Kayak and Paddle rental for 4 hours, $90</p><p></p><p><u><b>Trip 2</b></u>: Beach chair and umbrella rental for 1 day, $30</p><p><u style=""font-weight: bold;"">Trip 3</u>: Week-long snowboard rental, $300</p><p><u><b>Trip 4</b></u>: Bicycle tune-up for a mountain biking trip, $80</p><p>That's $500 for a year's worth of trip rentals! </p><p>With the OX, you can get all those items over the course of that same year for just $100.<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""> </span></p><p></p><p>So we hope you see that by joining the OX you’re getting an incredible value! For the same price as a base membership, you get that same kayak you would at the beach or the guided tour for an <i>entire week</i>, not just a few hours! </p><p>We also eliminate the hidden costs of ownership. Let’s say that you bought that $1000 kayak… after enjoying it, you have to clean it and store it. That’s time and space being taken from you! Instead, you could’ve had ten YEARS of gear access through our base membership for the same price, and never had to worry about the unintended consequences.</p><br/><h1><b>How Do We Reserve our Gear?</b></h1><p>Visit <a href=""http://www.usetheox.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our website</a> for <a href=""http://www.usetheox.com/index.html#faq"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">frequently asked questions</a> (and answers!).
