<p>We thought long and hard about a person’s personal security, our own security…….what would make us secure……where would we put it, how would we carry it and safely conceal it.</p>
<p>Next we thought who are the most vulnerable……Children, Elderly people (our parents or grandparents) A Significant Other, our Pets.</p>
<p>We are the creators of a GPS (tracking device the size of a Nickel .05 US coin), integrated locator using mobile tower trangulation connected to a mobile app called <strong>K-TRAC</strong> for Apple and Android. </p>
<p>K-TRAC is compatible with iPhone, iPad, and Android Devices.</p>
<p>There are over 800,000 children that go missing every year.  </p>
<p>K-TRAC is not only for Children…but Adults can be protected by the same device (depending on individual States and Privacy laws). Do you know how many adults go missing annually? Adults account for an additional 40,000 missing.</p>
<p>Developing K-TRAC is a passion for us. Download the K-TRAC App to your, iPhone, iPad, or Android. The K-TRAC device will come with the instructions and provide a redeem code for you to activate K-TRAC.</p>
<p><strong>How does K-TRAC work:</strong></p>
<p>Once you have activated K-TRAC you can decide where is the best place for you to conceal it.  </p>
<p><strong>How K-TRAC works</strong>:</p>
<p>The K-TRAC device integrated locator connects to mobile tower triangulation controlled by the K-TRAC mobile app. The functions include Range Alert, Street view, Satellite View.</p>
<p><strong>The K-TRAC device is powered by a CR1220 Lithium Coin Battery 3.0 Volt.</strong></p>
<p>Performs in extreme temperatures from -22ºF ~ 140ºF<br/>Holds power for 8 years when not in use<br/>Cell size: 1220, IEC: CR1220, Volt: 3</p>
<p><strong>How can you be sure the K-TRAC technology will work?</strong></p>
<p>K-TRAC has already completed beta testing and passed without any issues. We have invested heavily in developing the design, technology and sample production. The majority of this has been devoted to logic board development, battery technology and locator functionality.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are the risks?</strong></p>
<p>We do not see any risks at all as we have a proven design and working product already completed. We have also applied for patents for our design both domestic and international.</p>
<p><strong>What’s next for K-TRAC?</strong></p>
<p>We have a production-ready prototype in hand with component list, schematics, and assembly protocols.</p>
<p><strong>K-TRAC</strong> is ready for production.</p>
<p><strong>Why do we need your help?</strong></p>
<p>We are working with qualified Engineering Companies and we have come this far only on sweat, determination, and private funds who see value in the goals of K-TRAC. All costs so far have come from our own pockets and now we are finally at the point where it takes “real” money to make this happen.</p>
<p>This is why we’ve come to Indiegogo, to help us move forward with K-TRAC. We believe lost Children and Adults need to become a thing of the past. K-TRAC is simply the best way to find your lost child, parent and significant other.  Even the family pet.</p>
<p><strong>Where will your funding go?</strong></p>
<p>We have already invested heavily in the development of the prototype. Your funding is the critical link to the completion of our production phase 1 of the world’s smallest K-TRAC tracking device.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Funds</strong></p>
<p>We have working prototypes and a supply chain that's ready to go. We need your help to take the next step.<br/><br/> We will use the $500,000 raised through this campaign to buy the additional tooling and make the moulds we require for the casings, internal sections, components, connectors and logic boards and all of these parts add up very quickly.  In addition, the cost of bringing our new product K-TRAC to market.<br/><br/> Our manufacturing facility in Shanghai, China will be enhanced to incorporate the full production of K-TRAC.</p>

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Hello everyone, my name is Stu Leavitt, and my wife and I have five terrific children.  Our middle child, Megan, has suffered through an illness for the past 5 years.  The disease is called Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD) and is also known by Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS).  We raised Megan to love God and to love others and she has grown to live out these values in her daily life.  She prays for everyone she knows, has worked with non-profits to help people in need, and even sponsors two children through World Vision.  She genuinely loves to do right and has made me marvel that she keeps up her attitude in spite of her symptoms.  To see her in this pain is heartbreaking and we have tried over the years to get the best treatment for her and finally we could be reaching a turning point with upcoming therapy which is detailed below.  We do not have the money for this so I am appealing to you to help fund the cost of Megan’s infusion therapy which can begin this September.  Your contributions will help relieve some or most of her pain!</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>About Megan’s condition:</strong></span> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Megan’s RSD journey began during the winter of her junior year in High School when she slipped and put her hand out to brace her fall.  She suffered nerve compression in her left wrist and shortly after started noticing symptoms from her hand to her shoulder.  The following summer she was a passenger in a car, riding to a summer bible camp. They were stopped at a traffic light and a truck hit them from behind.  She was diagnosed with strained muscles in her neck and over the next few months, the RSD symptoms began to spread throughout her whole body.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Megan is young (age 22) and hopeful that her chances for abatement of the symptoms and partial or near complete relief from the pain are very good.  Her upcoming Ketamine infusion treatments could have a major impact on her future. </span> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>About the disease:</strong></span> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>RSD/CRPS</strong> is a chronic pain condition which affects the central nervous system affecting skin, joints, muscles, bones and sometimes impacting other organs.  </span> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Megan’s</strong> <strong>Symptoms are:  </strong>Various degrees of burning pain in the skin and muscles, fatigue, extreme sensitivity to touch, trouble keeping food down, constant urge to urinate, headaches, blurry vision, trouble with motor skills, dizziness.</span> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Treatments she has had:  </strong>Megan has medical insurance and has spent most of her income over the years treating this condition.  She has had MRI studies, EMG/NCV studies, thermograms - among other tests.  She’s tried holistic approaches and altered her diet.  Megan’s been treated by medical doctors, neurologists, reflexologists, chiropractors, homeopaths, and to this point has not been able to get relief from her symptoms.</span> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>One more treatment that she is scheduled for:</strong>  A leading doctor in the fight against CRPS is located in Philadelphia, PA which is 50 miles from where she lives.  He has pioneered the use of a drug called Ketamine which is a type of anesthetic which works on the brain and neurological system.  Megan is currently a patient of his and scheduled for an FDA-Approved 10-day infusion at the end of this summer beginning September 4th.  Unfortunately, her insurance does not cover this treatment which costs around $12,000.00.</span>  </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Here is a word from a close friend of Megan’s:</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p2"">My name is Michael, and I received the privilege of being asked to write about Megan; to describe her personality so you can better understand who she is and why she needs your help.  I will start by asking you a simple question:  have you ever had the opportunity to meet someone who can’t stop smiling?  I have; the first time I met Megan over five years ago I realized I had just met someone different.  She wasn’t the type of person to frown when the sun wasn’t shining or when things didn’t go her way.  “Big deal!” you say, “I have met plenty of people like that!”  Well let me ask you just a few more questions.  Have you ever been dizzy to the point of collapsing?  Have you ever had an excruciating headache throughout the entire day?  Have you ever burned your hand on a stove, been sick with a stomach virus, or only gotten four hours of sleep a night?  Sure, we’ve all had these ailments a time or two.  Each one alone can be crippling and can ruin a perfectly good day.  That is why I was amazed to learn that Megan has RSD, a disorder of the nervous system, and she lives with the symptoms stated above every day.  I was amazed because even though she is in such pain and discomfort everyday she still looks on the bright side.  She has told me on more than one account that she is glad she is experiencing this disorder so she can better understand those people who suffer from similar ailments.  I am ashamed to admit when I get the stomach flu or I miss a night’s rest.  I never think about others who live with acid reflux, IBS, or Insomnia.   I just mumble and complain.  But Megan Doesn’t.  She refuses to let this disorder shut her in a room all day.  Instead she puts on a smile, and walks out the door searching for the first person walking down the street frowning to try and brighten their day.  I know countless people, more than she would be willing to admit, who have been affected by her positive attitude - MYSELF included.  But I must tell you - RSD is a disorder that doesn’t get better when left untreated.  No, just the opposite, it will continue to get worse.  I don’t want to see my dearest friend crippled by RSD.  So will you please join me in taking out a page from Megan’s book?  Let’s not focus on our own petty ailments, let’s help those who have some serious problems and disorders.  With Jesus leading (and us following) I know we can have an impact not only in Megan’s life, but in others like her as well.  This is Megan’s Hope!</p>

Because of the lack of funding we already had to drop out of one tournament, choosing to save our own money in order to make the trip to the regional championship in Augusta, GA. Because of that we have all but completely expended our own personal funds, leaving us very little to make the trip to the Cup and any tournaments in the future. Every little bit helps.

<h3>How it all began....</h3>
<p>Chris &amp; Missy Wallace; founder of Wild Oats, stumbled upon their creation by chance and circumstance.  We had just embarked on a new adventure, a small coffee and cupcake shop in North Carolina. We would sometimes put in 15 hour days starting as early as 3am. We had very little time to prepare a healthy breakfast and found ourselves eating unhealthy alternatives. Our kitchen was full of great ingredients for baking, rolled oats, brown sugar, nuts, coconut and dried fruits etc.  We had a hard time finding quick oatmeal that wasn't loaded with sugar and artifical flavors so we decided to play around with some of our baking ingredients.  After one taste we realized we were on to something! We were so pleased with the results that we decided to offer it to our customers. The only problem was the packaging. The business that we had was certified under the Department of Agricutlure which meant that all of the items that we served had to be in disposable containers. We knew that we had to find something that had a lid but would also hold up to boiling water. We finally settled on ""soup"" containers. They were not only the perfect size to hold a generous serving of oats but they could also withstand the high temps. We started offering the oatmeal to our customers and it was a huge sucess! We could not keep the shelves stocked. We have since then sold our coffee shop in North Carolina and have relocated to Charleston South Carolina. We want to offer the same convenient and healthy breakfast to other coffee shops and have been working hard on creating accounts in our new hometown. Since adding the online ordering system we realize that we will not be able to keep up with the demand of prodcution, shipping and handling.  We have decided to partner with Missy's mom ""Jean"" who lost her job in July due to breast cancer. Jean will be handling all of the internet orders, shipping and handling for the midwest region.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>About our oats....</h3>
<p>What better way to gain the strength and energy to carry you through a hectic morning schedule than with a steaming bowl of freshly cooked oatmeal? Wild Oats all-natural oatmeal allows you to taste food in its natural state. All-natural oatmeal means that we use only 100% natural ingredients! No GMOs, crazy chemical treatments or artificial ingredients or flavors. Each handy individual serving is fiber and protein packed, with special ingredients that make for a hearty, delicious taste. We only use the good stuff like organic brown sugar, toasted almonds, cranberries, blueberries, natural walnuts and much more! The result is a tasty and quick breakfast that you can feel good about! Wild oats come conveninetly packaged in indiviudal servings, all the consumer has to do is add 1 cup of boiling water. Within 3 minutes you have a quick tasty breakfast on the go. These are great for grabbing on your way out the door, traveling, camping, also great for coffee shops, offices and cafeterias.</p>
<p>Wild Oats currently comes in 6 great flavors: PAPA BEAR, TRIPLE BERRY, SUNNY MORNING, JUST OATS, SPICED CHAI &amp; CARAMEL APPLE. For more information check out our website at <a href=""http://www.wild4oats.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.wild4oats.com</a></p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p>We will use the funding from our campaign to improve our packaging, marketing and wholesale supplies that we need in order to produce a more efficient product. We also need to secure a kitchen for the midwest production. The amount we are asking for will not be the full amount that we need but we hope that we will go above and beyond our goal.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Benefits of Oatmeal</h3>
<p>Oatmeal Benefit #1   RICH IN FIBER. Oatmeal is rich in fiber, making it beneficial for the heart and the digestive process. The soluble fiber in oatmeal reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the ‘bad cholesterol’ in your digestive tract. It cleanses out your colon and lets your digestive tract properly function.</p>
<p>Oatmeal Benefit #2   LOW IN CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM AND CALORIES. Certainly, oatmeal is the friendliest food for anyone who suffers from high blood pressure and for those who have some weight management issues.

Chris & Missy Wallace; founder of Wild Oats, stumbled upon their creation by chance and circumstance.  We had just embarked on a new adventure, a small coffee and cupcake shop in North Carolina. We would sometimes put in 15 hour days starting as early as 3am. We had very little time to prepare a healthy breakfast and found ourselves eating unhealthy alternatives. Our kitchen was full of great ingredients for baking, rolled oats, brown sugar, nuts, coconut and dried fruits etc.  We had a hard time finding quick oatmeal that wasn't loaded with sugar and artifical flavors so we decided to play around with some of our baking ingredients.  After one taste we realized we were on to something! We were so pleased with the results that we decided to offer it to our customers. The only problem was the packaging. The business that we had was certified under the Department of Agricutlure which meant that all of the items that we served had to be in disposable containers. We knew that we had to find something that had a lid but would also hold up to boiling water. We finally settled on ""soup"" containers. They were not only the perfect size to hold a generous serving of oats but they could also withstand the high temps. We started offering the oatmeal to our customers and it was a huge sucess! We could not keep the shelves stocked. We have since then sold our coffee shop in North Carolina and have relocated to Charleston South Carolina. We want to offer the same convenient and healthy breakfast to other coffee shops and have been working hard on creating accounts in our new hometown. Since adding the online ordering system we realize that we will not be able to keep up with the demand of prodcution, shipping and handling.  We have decided to partner with Missy's mom ""Jean"" who lost her job in July due to breast cancer. Jean will be handling all of the internet orders, shipping and handling for the midwest region.
 
About our oats....
What better way to gain the strength and energy to carry you through a hectic morning schedule than with a steaming bowl of freshly cooked oatmeal? Wild Oats all-natural oatmeal allows you to taste food in its natural state. All-natural oatmeal means that we use only 100% natural ingredients! No GMOs, crazy chemical treatments or artificial ingredients or flavors. Each handy individual serving is fiber and protein packed, with special ingredients that make for a hearty, delicious taste. We only use the good stuff like organic brown sugar, toasted almonds, cranberries, blueberries, natural walnuts and much more! The result is a tasty and quick breakfast that you can feel good about! Wild oats come conveninetly packaged in indiviudal servings, all the consumer has to do is add 1 cup of boiling water. Within 3 minutes you have a quick tasty breakfast on the go. These are great for grabbing on your way out the door, traveling, camping, also great for coffee shops, offices and cafeterias.
Wild Oats currently comes in 6 great flavors: PAPA BEAR, TRIPLE BERRY, SUNNY MORNING, JUST OATS, SPICED CHAI & CARAMEL APPLE. For more information check out our website at www.wild4oats.com
 

We will use the funding from our campaign to improve our packaging, marketing and wholesale supplies that we need in order to produce a more efficient product. We also need to secure a kitchen for the midwest production. The amount we are asking for will not be the full amount that we need but we hope that we will go above and beyond our goal.
 

Benefits of Oatmeal
Oatmeal Benefit #1   RICH IN FIBER. Oatmeal is rich in fiber, making it beneficial for the heart and the digestive process. The soluble fiber in oatmeal reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the ‘bad cholesterol’ in your digestive tract. It cleanses out your colon and lets your digestive tract properly function.
Oatmeal Benefit #2   LOW IN CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM AND CALORIES. Certainly, oatmeal is the friendliest food for anyone who suffers from high blood pressure and for those who have some weight management issues. It has been found in studies that those who eat more oats are less likely to develop heart disease.
Oatmeal Benefit #3   GOOD NUMBER OF PHYTOCHEMICALS According to the American Cancer Society, phytochemicals and the insoluble fiber in oats help the body fight against toxic bile acids. This helps lower the risk of cancer.
Oatmeal Benefit #4   PLENTY of B VITAMINS. Vitamin B in oats helps the brain and the nervous system to function properly. If you want to make your memory alert, then start to have some oatmeal each day.
Oatmeal Benefit #5   NATURAL FATS FOR THE SKIN. Oats are rich in natural lubricating fats which help prevent dry and itchy skin. The fats even leave a thin layer of protection for the skin. Oats also let your skin get rid of acne and impurities.
Oatmeal Benefit #6   CARBOHYDRATES FOR ENERGY. While being low in calories and cholesterol, oats have high amounts of carbohydrates, making it a perfect meal for those who are dieting.

<h3><strong>2.  TRYOUTS / Combines:  NO NEED for slap stick machines anymore.  With VERT you simply attach VERT to your waist and get immediate vertical jump measurments without the hassle and time wasted with traditional vertical jump tests.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>3.  VOLLEYBALL:  How many times did you jump during practice or a game?  VERT counts all that for you to make sure you stay in peak performance as well as prevent injuries.  (It also measure how high your Spike, Block or jump serve is so that you can perfect or game!)  See below for full coaching player management system</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>4.  BASKETBALL:  What's your VERT?  Now you know.  Compete, challenge, compare, and share your results with your friends (or competition).</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>5.  EXTREME SPORTS: in your own Backyard!  Attach to your BMX bike and see how high your bunny hop was without guessing.  It's like being in your own Xgames!</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH YOUR VERT MEASURMENT?</strong></h3>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1338.photobucket.com/albums/o693/Mayfonk/VERT%20indiegogo%20pics/EVERYjump2_zps0c94b94d.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>VERT is a fitness jump device worn near the waist of an athlete that measures every leap and transmits the data to a smart phone or tablet.  You can see all jump measurements immediately on the VERT device and simultaneously on any smart phone or tablet with the downloadable VERT SKILZ app or VERT coach app.  What was traditionally available with special stationary equipment to determine jump measurement, can now be done anywhere, anytime in real-time.</p>
<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1338.photobucket.com/albums/o693/Mayfonk/VERT%20indiegogo%20pics/VERThand2_zps0c40ad38.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<h3>VERT unit in hand.  Measurements: length 1.96” x width 0.31” x height 0.86”</h3>
<p>Designed to be small and discreet, the VERT device is worn by an athlete and allows the user to know his or her vertical measurement right on the device via OLED, or wirelessly in real-time from the sideline via a smart phone or tablet.</p>
<h3>VERT SKILZ app for smart phone.</h3>

<h3>Why should athletes have all the fun?</h3>
Spectators can follow an athlete’s performance as it happens on their smart device. Coaches can monitor the athlete’s performance, fans can follow their favorite players and parents can better enjoy their kids’ games…it’s fun for everyone!
<h3>VERT COACH app for smart tablets.</h3>

<p><strong>VERT SPORT MODE releases</strong></p>
<p>We are planning on releasing free updates and different modes for all vertical jump sports. VERT 1.0 is for any activity that involves jumping like basketball, volleyball or health &amp; fitness such as jump rope.  Additional modes on the app will be released such as skateboard, BMX and cycle sports, football, track &amp; field, etc.  If you want to know how high or how often you jumped – the VERT device will tell you in an instant.  Skateboarders will know their VERT on a ramp and freestyle BMX athletes will know their VERT on a bunny hop.  Whether the athlete’s objective is better fitness or performance, VERT’s feedback will have a more accurate measurement that was not previously available.</p>
<p><strong>VERT unit will be available with different attachments including clip, active waist band and we are working on partnerships with apparal brands to have special pocket in active wear.</strong></p>

5.  EXTREME SPORTS: in your own Backyard!  Attach to your BMX bike and see how high your bunny hop was without guessing.  It's like being in your own Xgames!
WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH YOUR VERT MEASURMENT?

VERT is a fitness jump device worn near the waist of an athlete that measures every leap and transmits the data to a smart phone or tablet.  You can see all jump measurements immediately on the VERT device and simultaneously on any smart phone or tablet with the downloadable VERT SKILZ app or VERT coach app.  What was traditionally available with special stationary equipment to determine jump measurement, can now be done anywhere, anytime in real-time.

VERT unit in hand.  Measurements: length 1.96” x width 0.31” x height 0.86”
Designed to be small and discreet, the VERT device is worn by an athlete and allows the user to know his or her vertical measurement right on the device via OLED, or wirelessly in real-time from the sideline via a smart phone or tablet.
VERT SKILZ app for smart phone.

Why should athletes have all the fun?
Spectators can follow an athlete’s performance as it happens on their smart device. Coaches can monitor the athlete’s performance, fans can follow their favorite players and parents can better enjoy their kids’ games…it’s fun for everyone!
VERT COACH app for smart tablets.

VERT coach app player management system designed for smart tablets.  Multiple player data analysis including: Amount of jumps, average jumps, time in game, last vert and highest vert.  Volley VERT coach app also has player analysis tab including game graphics, season analysis tab, top 10 team rank tab, and coach note tab.
 

VERT SPORT MODE releases
We are planning on releasing free updates and different modes for all vertical jump sports. VERT 1.0 is for any activity that involves jumping like basketball, volleyball or health & fitness such as jump rope.  Additional modes on the app will be released such as skateboard, BMX and cycle sports, football, track & field, etc.  If you want to know how high or how often you jumped – the VERT device will tell you in an instant.  Skateboarders will know their VERT on a ramp and freestyle BMX athletes will know their VERT on a bunny hop.  Whether the athlete’s objective is better fitness or performance, VERT’s feedback will have a more accurate measurement that was not previously available.
VERT unit will be available with different attachments including clip, active waist band and we are working on partnerships with apparal brands to have special pocket in active wear.
 

VERT TECHNICAL DATA
VERT is a wearable miniature inertial measurement unit (IMU), with a very high precision 3X gyroscope and high precision high rate 3X accelerometer.  VERT unit calculates motion in all direction using a built-in ARM Cortex M3.  The VERT unit has a proprietary algorithm that has over 53 simultaneous calculations to measure vertical height to within 96% accuracy.  VERT is smaller than a matchbox and can be worn or mounted virtually anywhere.  VERT has a built-in OLED display for instant display. VERT also has built-in Bluetooth 4.0, which communicates with proprietary VERT SKILZ app in iOS and Android device. VERT SKILZ app syncs with VERT and displays results in real-time.
Requirements: 

iOS devices with Bluetooth 4.0 (iPhone 4s, iPhone 5, new iPad, New Touch, mini iPad) 
Android devices supporting Bluetooth Low Energy, running Android 4.0 and newer.

<h3>A Little About Cory</h3>
<p>My name is Cory Jacobson and I’m 22 years old. I’ve lived in Colorado Springs for about 14 years now and I love it! I moved here from Minnesota and I’m definitely a fan of the Colorado weather; even though it can be bi-polar at times haha! I moved here with my mom Cheryl, my dad Dan, and my younger sister Kate. My sister and I are both affected by a genetic disability called Spinal Muscular Atrophy, type 2; or SMA for short. It’s a neuromuscular disease that affects all of our muscles. I require the use of an electric wheelchair and also assistance with most of my activities throughout the day. I graduated high school in 2008 and graduated with my Associates degree from Pikes Peak community college in December of 2010. I met my husband, Ian, while attending college. He and I got married in April 2011. Since being married, Ian has become my primary care giver. I have a nursing aide who comes during the weekdays to take care of me while Ian is gone at work. He’s a paralegal specialist in the US Army and is stationed at Ft. Carson. Military life can be a difficult one at times, but I certainly would not trade it for anything. I strongly believe that everything my husband and I have been through together has made us so much stronger; whether it’s struggles related to his job, challenges that are brought on by my disability, or just any type of difficulties that a marriage can bring. We’re not just stronger as a couple, but stronger individuals as well. We recently moved into our own place and while we love having our own space, it has been a unique experience to say the least trying to learn how to manage all of our struggles on our own. I have never lived away from my parents, so I was used to having someone always available to take care of me. Ian and I are still getting adjusted to living on our own, but it has been a wonderful experience and we’ve been tackling each obstacle we face together. Right now we’re working on paying for an accessible wheelchair accessible van. We’re a one-income home so affording expensive things like a van can be a challenge. But as I said before, we take on each challenge together and I know we’ll figure out a way to conquer this one as well. We're asking our community, friends, and family to help us raise the funds to pay for an accessible van. </p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We're trying to raise $13,000 in 120 days! All of the funds we raise go directly towards the cost of a van. We're currently coming up with unique perks of things that you'll receive in return for oyur contribution! A couple of examples of things that I'm considering are hand painted pictures done by me or hand made bracelets also made by me.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Helping Ian and I fund a wheelchair accessible vehicle will have a huge impact on both of our lives. We currently live off of one income because I am unable to work. I've created this site in hopes to find a way to help contribute more so in any possible way I can. Having a wheelchair accessible van gives Ian and I the freedom to be an independent, adult couple. That alone means the world to us.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">The sensors inside Atmotube keep constant track of the air parameters. Every two seconds, your Atmotube will measure concentration of VOCs, temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure, then send them all to your smartphone via Bluetooth (BT5.0).</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549120799/dqalotitvmmpvrpmc9um.svg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The Atmotube mobile app is free and available for iOS 9 and Android 4.3+ smartphones with Bluetooth LE support. Its clear and simple user interface shows current air quality readings and helps you track the history of your measurements and your personal air score. If the air quality gets below certain point, you will immediately receive an alert notification. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Air quality has a significant impact on our lives. Good outdoor and indoor air quality is crucial to our well-being. An average person automatically takes over 20,000 breaths daily, and unless we encounter a problem, we never think about WHAT we breathe in and how air components can affect our bodies. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6a599e_6cabc84f389b4aa3a7c8450351467104~mv2.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">But, there are potential dangers lurking in the air, such as VOCs, and various harmful gases - both indoors and outside. Moreover, according to WHO, 92% of the world’s population lives in places where air quality levels exceed WHO limits. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534955176/v4eiih6lqyj2zskpva7a.svg"" src=""""/><strong> </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)</strong> are emitted as gases from liquids or solids and can have short and long-term adverse health effects on respiratory systems. Over time, exposure to VOCs has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, liver and brain damage, and even cancer.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6a599e_979077fa335d4305a0312e7553f2966c~mv2.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Recently, more and more people are becoming weather-dependent and are susceptible to diseases such as asthma, COPD, and allergies. Air pollution can worsen or even cause lung diseases, but today there is a very little understanding of what exact levels of air pollution affect our health.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535562577/g4dh1nrk5jnpmxorobug.svg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">At the same time, even very simple steps like improving ventilation, monitoring humidity, avoiding certain polluted areas, getting rid of aggressive household chemicals, or wearing a mask, can make a big difference. With Atmotube, you can easily control the air you breathe and eliminate potential danger before it has time to affect you.  Most people don't find out they've been exposed to toxic air until it's too late, so we decided to create these beautiful and functional devices that can seamlessly integrate into your life and alert you to potential danger in the air.<br/> </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">This beautiful product went through over 4 years of research and development, evolving its design and features into the Atmotube you see today.   We began design and engineering of our very first Atmotube back in 2014. In 2015, we launched it on Indiegogo; with the tremendous support of our backers and partners, we gathered 338% of our targeted goal.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Today, we have produced and shipped several thousand Atmotubes. They are now available on our website, Amazon, and by retail in many countries. We received tons of valuable feedback and accumulated lots of knowledge about specific air pollutants, sensor technologies, and our users’ wants and needs to create an even more useful and indispensable product.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Over the last few years our team has grown from 6 to 16 people. We now have 11+ years of experience in research and development, industrial design, and software development for consumer electronics. Together we have worked on big projects for well-known companies, and now we are here to bring our very own product to market.</p>

Atmotube Makes You Smarter about the Air You Breathe




Atmotube can help to:

Reduce exposure to harmful gases.
Prevent allergy or asthma attacks caused by polluted air and identify sources of air pollution.
Avoid polluted areas by getting alert notifications if the air is not safe.
Be aware of weather changes.
Monitor air temperature and humidity to stay in a comfort zone and feel better.

 



Atmotube PLUS is a wearable, portable device that monitors the quality and safety of the air you breathe. With more precise and reliable sensors, it accurately measures real-time air pollution caused by harmful gases and a wide range of Volatile Organic compounds (VOCs) like acetone, methanol, benzene, ethanol, toluene, xylene, and formaldehyde. It also measures atmospheric pressure, temperature, and humidity. 
 
Features


Atmotube PLUS uniquely combines style with functionality, using the most innovative sensors to provide real-time measurements of indoor and outdoor air. We've done a lot of work to maximize the value of Atmotube PLUS features and enhance user experience.


 
Why Atmotube Plus is better than other trackers




Advanced: features the newest generation of sensors for the instant detection of harmful gases, no calibration required – it just works!

Compact: a set of high-quality air pollution sensors are now packed into a small and stylish handheld device

How it works

The sensors inside Atmotube keep constant track of the air parameters. Every two seconds, your Atmotube will measure concentration of VOCs, temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure, then send them all to your smartphone via Bluetooth (BT5.0).

The Atmotube mobile app is free and available for iOS 9 and Android 4.3+ smartphones with Bluetooth LE support. Its clear and simple user interface shows current air quality readings and helps you track the history of your measurements and your personal air score. If the air quality gets below certain point, you will immediately receive an alert notification. 

With Atmotube, you can also contribute to global air quality data crowdsourcing: all gathered data on air quality will display on your personal map and, if you wish, your gathered data can be shared with others via the Global Air Quality Map.
 
 

Why We Need to Care About Air Quality


Air quality has a significant impact on our lives. Good outdoor and indoor air quality is crucial to our well-being. An average person automatically takes over 20,000 breaths daily, and unless we encounter a problem, we never think about WHAT we breathe in and how air components can affect our bodies. 

But, there are potential dangers lurking in the air, such as VOCs, and various harmful gases - both indoors and outside. Moreover, according to WHO, 92% of the world’s population lives in places where air quality levels exceed WHO limits.  
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are emitted as gases from liquids or solids and can have short and long-term adverse health effects on respiratory systems. Over time, exposure to VOCs has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, liver and brain damage, and even cancer.

Recently, more and more people are becoming weather-dependent and are susceptible to diseases such as asthma, COPD, and allergies. Air pollution can worsen or even cause lung diseases, but today there is a very little understanding of what exact levels of air pollution affect our health.

At the same time, even very simple steps like improving ventilation, monitoring humidity, avoiding certain polluted areas, getting rid of aggressive household chemicals, or wearing a mask, can make a big difference. With Atmotube, you can easily control the air you breathe and eliminate potential danger before it has time to affect you.  Most people don't find out they've been exposed to toxic air until it's too late, so we decided to create these beautiful and functional devices that can seamlessly integrate into your life and alert you to potential danger in the air. 
 

Make it a Part of Your Life

We designed Atmotube PLUS so that it can be used both indoors and outside.  Atmotube PLUS is innovative, portable, technologically advanced device is designed to be an integral part of your lifestyle. It can be with you everywhere, giving you actual information about air quality, pollution, and harmful gases right where you are. It will always be there for you and for those you care about most.   
The Impact 
The aggregated environmental data is shared to a Global Air Quality Map that is free for everyone to use. Atmotube PLUS is a personal contribution to global air pollution awareness, as well as a potential lifesaver for you and your family.

Our Team and Our Story

This beautiful product went through over 4 years of research and development, evolving its design and features into the Atmotube you see today.   We began design and engineering of our very first Atmotube back in 2014. In 2015, we launched it on Indiegogo; with the tremendous support of our backers and partners, we gathered 338% of our targeted goal.

Today, we have produced and shipped several thousand Atmotubes. They are now available on our website, Amazon, and by retail in many countries. We received tons of valuable feedback and accumulated lots of knowledge about specific air pollutants, sensor technologies, and our users’ wants and needs to create an even more useful and indispensable product.  
 
Over the last few years our team has grown from 6 to 16 people. We now have 11+ years of experience in research and development, industrial design, and software development for consumer electronics. Together we have worked on big projects for well-known companies, and now we are here to bring our very own product to market.

With your help, we'll be able to raise awareness about the importance of air quality, motivate people to spend more time in safer environments, and help people from sensitive and at-risk groups to feel more secure.

Frequently Asked Questions

 What are the VOCs? 
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are emitted as gases from certain solids or liquids. In fact, they may be emitted by a wide array of products, including paints and lacquers, paint strippers, cleaning supplies, household products such as varnishes and wax, cleaning and disinfecting, products, building materials (plywood and particleboard) and furnishings, office equipment such as copiers and printers, glues and adhesives. 
 
VOCs can cause eye, nose, and throat irritation as well as headaches, loss of coordination, and nausea. They may also cause damage to the liver, kidney, and central nervous system. Some are suspected or known to cause cancer. 
 
You can find the list of VOCs here: https://iaspub.epa.gov/sor_internet/registry/su...

 Why should I use Atmotube? People don’t realize how what’s in the air might affect our health. But there are potential dangers in the air around you. Atmotube device can help you to detect VOC pollutants and do proactive actions such as air ventilation, air purification or finding source of pollution.  How does Atmotube PLUS VOC sensor work? Atmotube constantly monitors air pollution in real time. We utilize a MOX-based (Metal-oxide) sensor in our product. The functionality of a MOX gas sensor is based on the conductivity-change of the gas-sensitive MOX semi-conductor layers at gas exposure, which can be externally measured and analyzed. A specific MOX gas-sensitive layer reacts to oxidizable gases with increasing of the layer resistance and to reducible gases with decreasing of the layer resistance.  How often does it take measurements? Atmotube PLUS take VOC measurements every 2 seconds and store it to the memory every 1 minute. How long does it work on single charge? Atmotube PLUS takes can work 1 week on a single charge. How portable is it? How much does it weigh? Atmotube PLUS only weighs 1.4 ounces (40 grams), so it’s perfectly portable, even pocketable. It has carabiner mount to let you to clip it anywhere, on any bag or even a key ring. Do I need to download the app to use Atmotube? Yes, Atmotube sends all measured data to your mobile phone via Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) protocol. You can download our free Atmotube app from Google Play or App Store.  Can I use Atmotube without the phone? Yes, you can – Atmotube has internal memory to store data for several days. To detect current level of pollution you can press the button and check LED color. You can sync the data later with smartphone. If you need GPS location for the readings the phone need to be close to the Atmotube device.  Will Atmotube work with any Smartphone? Atmotube is compatible with iOS 9+ devices and Android 4.3+ devices with Bluetooth Low Energy support.  Is the Atmotube mobile app free? Absolutely!  Will I receive any alerts if the air quality is poor? Yes, you will get immediate notification if Atmotube detects air quality lower than specific level to your smartphone. This notification is customizable via settings.  What is Air Quality Score? Atmotube detects a very wide range of harmful gases, toxins, and volatile organic compounds. For your convenience, we created an accumulative parameter called Air Quality Score (AQS) that can instantly give you an understanding of the quality of air around. AQS changes from 0 (severely polluted air) to 100 (very clean) points. There’s a LED on the front of Atmotube. What does each color mean? The LED color represents the current Air Quality Score. (Red - severely polluted, Orange - very polluted, Yellow - polluted, Green - moderate, Blue - good).  Is Atmotube waterproof? Atmotube design is meant to provide a good airflow for the sensors inside, so it can’t be waterproof at the same time. Please do not put it in water. What is the operating temperature of Atmotube? Recommended operating temperature for Atmotube sensors is from -5°C to +50°C.  How is Atmotube calibrated? Each sensor will be pre-calibrated. Sensors have sophisticated embedded algorithms to perform automatic calibration over time.  How does the Air Quality Map work? If you will decide to contribute to Global Map - your GPS coordinates will be linked with your AQS measurements, periodically uploaded to our secure cloud, and then will be aggregated on the air quality map. The map is available for public viewing.  Who can see my Air Quality data? Only you can view your AQS history data. But you can share it on the map to make your contribution into the global air quality map.  What happens to the money you raise? Your money will only be used to build your product - all funds pledged will be spent for tooling, manufacturing setup and component costs.  When will my Atmotube ship? According to our plan we will start shipping Atmotube PLUS in early December 2018. Our first supporters will receive their orders first.  Where will you ship? We ship Atmotubes worldwide!  What will Atmotube PLUS cost at retail? The target retail price of Atmotube PLUS is $99 plus sales tax.  Does Atmotube come with a warranty? Yes! We offer a 12 month manufacturer’s warranty on all our products.  How do I get ahold of our team? Please contact info@atmotube.com.  Can I change or cancel my perk?

But years of heavy use and just living your everyday life can wear out and damage that foundation. But what if there were a simple solution that could help realign your body and help you get through your day pain-free?  A doctor-prescribed orthotic can help you do just that. Orthotics slip into your shoe and work to strengthen and align your feet and ankles, distribute your weight evenly, correct imbalances, and, best of all, reduce the misery that comes from pain in your feet, ankles, knees, hips, and back.But prescription orthotics aren’t the kind of inserts you find at the drug store. They normally require a doctor’s visit and can run you anywhere between $400-$600 since they’re not usually covered by insurance, making them out of reach for many suffering from pain. We set out to create an orthotic that is both customizable AND affordable to help relieve pain for as many people as possible.  
 Superthotics instantly corrects your foot and ankle alignment so your whole body goes back into alignment with a patented innovation that --up to now -- could only be achieved with a doctor-prescribed orthotic. 
It’s precision molded with the same type of high-tech polymers as costly prescription orthotics and designed to last for many years of support and comfort.  The durable arch support helps reduce pain, improve balance and make walking and exercise more comfortable. The proprietary Bio-Lock Heel Cup stabilizes the heel and ankle, putting your foot into its correct alignment. And we've cushioned our Bio-Lock Heel Cup for extra comfort and shock absorption.  We also added metatarsal support to support the ball of your foot.

<h3><strong>                                                 ******</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>         Je dois d'abord dire que je sais qu'il y a pire que ce qui m'est arrivé, et j'ai aussi le coeur brisé lorsque je vois des gens dans la misère, mais il y a des situations malheureuses qui sont faciles à éviter et il faut seulement être avertis!! S'IL-VOUS-PLAÎT, ne faites plus jamais le choix de ne pas contracter une assurance lorsque vous quittez le pays!!!!! Ceci n'est pas une collecte de fonds, c'est une conscientisation!</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>        Cette page a été créée car des gens près de moi ont proposé un moyen de m'aider, mais je ne demande rien!</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>        J'ai eu plus de visibilité que je n'en espérais et la manière de faire peut être discutable, mais au moins le message est passé; prenez des assurances voyage, car personne ne voudrait prendre le risque de se blesser à l'extérieur et devoir débourser 27000$ en plus! </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>        Pour ceux qui aimeraient connaître ce qui s'est passé, je le raconte ci-dessous.</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<h3> _______________________ French ______________________</h3>
<h3>
<br/><br/>Le début de l'aventure ..</h3>
<p><br/>Tout a commencé lorsque je tentais un dernier voyage en 2012-2013. Comme mon budget ne permettait pas un voyage dispendieux, j'ai pu acheter mon billet via le partenariat d'une amie qui travaille pour une compagnie aérienne. Étant donné que je voyageais stand-by, sans siège attribué et courant de gate en gate pour partir n'importe où dans le monde ou presque, ca a été le plus beau moment de ma vie de me faire attribuer un siège après 2 jours d'attente dans les aéroports! Des larmes de joie coulaient sur mes joues et même si nous avons attendu encore une heure ou deux avant de décoller du au dégivrage de l'avion, je n'avais plus aucune raison de m'inquiéter! Je partais enfin pour la Californie! Mais durant le voyage ..<br/><br/></p>
<h3>Mon accident</h3>
<p>Le jour où je devais quitter San Diego pour me diriger vers Los Angeles, les personnes qui m'hébergeaient sont partis travailler en ne pensant pas que j'étais à l'extérieur de l'appartement. Ils ont donc barré la porte en sortant, et j'étais prise dehors sans ressources! Puisque nous avions ouvert une fenêtre quelques jours auparavant pour entrer et que j'avais replacé cette même fenêtre, c'est la première idée qui m'est venue en tête. J'ai donc soulevé la fenêtre à l'aide des pentures, et malheureusement, j'ai dû trouver un point faible car celle-ci a éclaté..</p>
<p>Voyant mes os à travers trois de mes doigts, j'ai paniqué .. à ce moment précis, j'étais seul au monde, n'ayant pas de preuve d'identité sur moi, pas de téléphone, personne. Le monde a semblé vide pendant plusieurs longues secondes. Mes doigts ont commencé à saigner, et je ne savais pas combien de temps je tiendrais avant de m'évanouir. Je me suis rendue chez les voisins le plus rapidement possible et heureusement, malgré que mon sang tombait partout sur leur tapis, ils ont répondu et ont accepté de m'aider. J'ai fait pression sur mes doigts avec un essuie-tout propre et ai levé ma main au dessus de mon cœur pour arrêter le saignement .. quand les premiers secours et l'ambulance sont arrivés, j'ai réalisé que mon cerveau ne connectait plus à mes doigts, et j'avais l'impression qu'ils tomberaient si je les tenais pas en place. Mes tendons ainsi que mes nerfs étaient sectionnés ..<br/><br/>Après les heures d'attente et de traitements hospitaliers, j'ai subit une chirurgie plastique reconstructive sur ma main afin de rattacher les tendons et les nerfs à mes doigts. J'ai passé une seule journée à l'hôpital, probablement puisque je les suppliais de me laisser partir le plus tôt possible car je n'avais aucun moyen de contacter qui que ce soit et mon amie m'attendait à un point de rencontre à Los Angeles. Cette amie est la sœur cadette de mon ex petit ami qui s'est suicidé en Mars 2012, et c'était la première fois que je la revoyais depuis tous les événements malheureux de l'année dernière. Je n'avais vraiment pas envie de la laisser à elle-même dans un monde inconnu. Je me suis sentie terriblement coupable toute la journée .. elle avait fait 20 heures d'autobus et de train pour me rejoindre ... Terrible pour moi de ne pas être au point de rendez-vous, mais surtout de ne pas être en mesure de lui communiquer ce qui se passait!</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h3>Ce que je vis présentement</h3>
<p><br/>L'hôpital de San Diego ne m'a pas donné beaucoup d'information sur ce qui m'arriverait suite à la chirurgie. Je suis donc revenue à Québec, et devait me présenter à l'hôpital tous les jours au début, puis encore plusieurs fois par semaine jusqu'à présent. Je suis suivie en chirurgie plastique spécialisée, ainsi qu'en ergothérapie, ou je réapprend tranquillement à utiliser ma main. Un mois après l'accident, je n'arrive toujours pas à  plier mes doigts le moindrement ni à les redresser complètement. Je fais des exercices qui prennent environ 1 heure à compléter, toutes les heures, donc continuellement .. toute la journée. J'ai perdu tous les muscles du bras et de la main gauche, du poignet et des doigts, et mon bras est maintenant la moitié de sa taille normale. Suite au port de deux plâtres, je porte maintenant une orthèse, en tout temps, qui est irritante pour ma peau qui elle meurt et pleume de partout. Je suis incapable de trouver un emploi en raison du temps que je dois consacrer aux exercices d'ergothérapie .. qui me prennent en moyenne 7 heures par jour.. et quel travail pourrais-je faire aussi bien que quelqu'un qui a ses deux mains?! J'arrive déjà difficilement à m'habiller! Taper sur un clavier prend également beaucoup de temps et de patience, mais je refuse d'abandonner!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Aujourd'hui, j'ai reçu de mauvaises nouvelles. Mes tendons se sont soudées à ma chair à l'intérieur de mes doigts .. et il est probablement trop tard pour être en mesure de plier la dernière phalange de deux d'entre eux un jour. Je garde espoir, mais je suis sortie de l'hôpital le coeur gros .. Je ferai tout mon possible pour qu'ils reviennent à la normale, mais ils sont assez enflés et je ne sens aucune force .. En fait, je ne ressens rien du tout peu importe ou je touche mon majeur et mon annulaire. Mais je n'abandonne pas, je garde espoir!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Le prix de ma main</h3>
<p><br/>Il y a quelques jours, j'ai reçu ma deuxième facture .. (la première étant 52,86 $ pour les radiographies) .. qui revient à 27 135,60 $ US, que je dois payer avant le 21 Février, sinon des intérêts seront ajoutés au montant. Ma carte de crédit est pleine, et ne pouvait encaisser que 5000 $ du total de toute manière. J'ai également 18000 $ à rembourser pour mes prêts d'études universitaires. Cependant, je ne serai pas en mesure de travailler avant encore 3 à 6 mois, dépendant de la progression de ma réadaptation.<br/><br/>J'ai dû dire adieux à toutes mes activités de vie .. escalade, boxe, travail sur le terrain, rénovation, cheerleading, etc. Tout est dangereux parce que les cicatrices à l'intérieur de ma main pourrait rouvrir s'il m'arrivait de faire un mauvais mouvement.

<h2>Here below is how it all happened..</h2>
<h2> </h2>
<h3>The beggining..</h3>
<p>Everything started while I was traveling for the last time in 2012-2013. As my budget did not allow an expansive trip, I was put on my friend's partnership on a flights company. Traveling stand-by, it was the luckiest time of my life to be given a seat after 2 wait days in airports. Tears of joy fell off my cheeks as we waited another hour or two for plane deicing, I so didn't care! I was finally making it to California!! But before coming back..</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>My accident</h3>
<p>The day I was moving from San Diego to Los Angeles, I got locked out the apartment where two new friends were allowing me to stay. They left for work in the morning, and forgot I was doing laundry outside. As we had opened a window only two days before to get into the apartment, it was the first idea that came through my mind; to reopen the same window that I had put back into place myself earlier. I lifted the window, pushing it upwards from the frame, and sadly.... I guess I just found a week spot.... the window collapsed..</p>
<p>Seeing my bones through three of my fingers, I panicked.. I was alone in the world at that moment, having no identity proof with me, no phone, no one. It started bleeding, and so I didn't know how much time I had left before fainting. I walked as fast as I could and knocked at the neighbours door, and after dropping blood all over their carpet :(, I wrapped my fingers in a clean paper towel and put pressure to stop the bleeding.. when first aid and ambulance arrived, I realized that my brain was no more connected to my fingers, and I felt just like if they would fall if I let go of them. My tendons and nerves were cut..</p>
<p>After all the hospital processing and wait, I had plastic reconstructive surgery on my hand so they would reattach tendons and nerves to my fingers. I have spent only one day at the hospital, it propably helped that I begged for them to let me go because I really had no way to contact anyone and my friend was waiting for me to join her in LA. She is the younger sister of my ex boyfriend who had committed suicide in March 2012, and it was the first time I was reuniting with her after all that happened last year, so I really didn't want to leave her in an unknown world by herself. I felt so awful all day long.. she was traveling 20 bus and train hours to meet me... AWFUL for me not to be there, not to be able to tell her what was happening!!!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What I'm going through now</h3>
<p>The hospital did not give me much information about what I would have to go through after surgery. So I traveled back to Quebec, and had appointments almost every day at first, then still several times a week up until now. I am followed by a hand plastic surgeon, and by ergotherapists who are helping me relearn how to use my hand. A month after the accident, I am still not able to fold my fingers or to straighten them. I am doing exercices that take 1 hour to complete, every hour, so mostly.. all day long. I have lost all muscles in my hand, wrist and whole arm, which is now half the size of the other and very week. After two plasters, I am wearing a brace that I can never take off, and which is iriting my skin, that is already dying and pealing off my whole arm. I am unable to find a job or work because of the time I need to spend on exercices.. 7 hours a day.. and what job can I do as good as anyone else with only one hand? I am not even able to get dressed properly by myself! Typing is also taking so much time and mind effort, but I refuse to give up!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Today, I've learned bad news. My tendons have welded themselves to the flesh inside my fingers.. and it is probably too late for me to be able to fold the last joint of two of my fingers someday. I keep hope, but walked out of the hospital very sad.. I do everything I can so they come back to normal, but they are now so swollen and I feel no strenght in them.. I actually feel nothing at all wherever I touch them. But I am not giving up, I am faithful!!!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The price of my hand</h3>
<p>A few days ago, I recieved my second bill.. (the first one being 52,86$ for XRAYS) ..which comes up to 27 135,60$ US, which I have to pay before February 21st, or else they will charge interest. My credit card is full, and could only take 5000$ of that amount anyways. I also have to pay 18000$ for my university studies. Fact is, I won't be able to work before another 3 to 6 months, depending on how readaptation is going.</p>
<p>I've lost all my life activities.. climbing, boxing, working on field, doing renovation, cheerleading, etc, everything is dangerous because the scars inside my hand could reopen if I happen to make a bad move. I still own a small event staff company, but am not able to take as many contracts as I would need to win my life back. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How you can help</h3>
<p>Any amount you can give, strarting from even 1 dollar, would make me so grateful that people like you exist :) I would be forever thankful if some people would help me repay my life back and repay the price of my hand.. and everyone around me knows that I would help all the people I admire as much as I can while never expecting anything in return, because the only reason for me to stay alive is to make the ones I love happy!!</p>
<p>If ever we can't make it, I'll keep on working hard on my side to repay the bill until I collect enough money!! The last solution is bankruptcy.. but it would still be so expensive, and would stick onto me all my life.. so I wish I don't have to go there.</p>
<p>I send to you all the greatest hug ever, leave your email address and I'll send you a special THANK YOU!!! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3</p>

         Je dois d'abord dire que je sais qu'il y a pire que ce qui m'est arrivé, et j'ai aussi le coeur brisé lorsque je vois des gens dans la misère, mais il y a des situations malheureuses qui sont faciles à éviter et il faut seulement être avertis!! S'IL-VOUS-PLAÎT, ne faites plus jamais le choix de ne pas contracter une assurance lorsque vous quittez le pays!!!!! Ceci n'est pas une collecte de fonds, c'est une conscientisation!
        Cette page a été créée car des gens près de moi ont proposé un moyen de m'aider, mais je ne demande rien!
        J'ai eu plus de visibilité que je n'en espérais et la manière de faire peut être discutable, mais au moins le message est passé; prenez des assurances voyage, car personne ne voudrait prendre le risque de se blesser à l'extérieur et devoir débourser 27000$ en plus! 
        Pour ceux qui aimeraient connaître ce qui s'est passé, je le raconte ci-dessous.

Le début de l'aventure ..
Tout a commencé lorsque je tentais un dernier voyage en 2012-2013. Comme mon budget ne permettait pas un voyage dispendieux, j'ai pu acheter mon billet via le partenariat d'une amie qui travaille pour une compagnie aérienne. Étant donné que je voyageais stand-by, sans siège attribué et courant de gate en gate pour partir n'importe où dans le monde ou presque, ca a été le plus beau moment de ma vie de me faire attribuer un siège après 2 jours d'attente dans les aéroports! Des larmes de joie coulaient sur mes joues et même si nous avons attendu encore une heure ou deux avant de décoller du au dégivrage de l'avion, je n'avais plus aucune raison de m'inquiéter! Je partais enfin pour la Californie! Mais durant le voyage ..
Mon accident
Le jour où je devais quitter San Diego pour me diriger vers Los Angeles, les personnes qui m'hébergeaient sont partis travailler en ne pensant pas que j'étais à l'extérieur de l'appartement. Ils ont donc barré la porte en sortant, et j'étais prise dehors sans ressources! Puisque nous avions ouvert une fenêtre quelques jours auparavant pour entrer et que j'avais replacé cette même fenêtre, c'est la première idée qui m'est venue en tête. J'ai donc soulevé la fenêtre à l'aide des pentures, et malheureusement, j'ai dû trouver un point faible car celle-ci a éclaté..
Voyant mes os à travers trois de mes doigts, j'ai paniqué .. à ce moment précis, j'étais seul au monde, n'ayant pas de preuve d'identité sur moi, pas de téléphone, personne. Le monde a semblé vide pendant plusieurs longues secondes. Mes doigts ont commencé à saigner, et je ne savais pas combien de temps je tiendrais avant de m'évanouir. Je me suis rendue chez les voisins le plus rapidement possible et heureusement, malgré que mon sang tombait partout sur leur tapis, ils ont répondu et ont accepté de m'aider. J'ai fait pression sur mes doigts avec un essuie-tout propre et ai levé ma main au dessus de mon cœur pour arrêter le saignement .. quand les premiers secours et l'ambulance sont arrivés, j'ai réalisé que mon cerveau ne connectait plus à mes doigts, et j'avais l'impression qu'ils tomberaient si je les tenais pas en place. Mes tendons ainsi que mes nerfs étaient sectionnés ..Après les heures d'attente et de traitements hospitaliers, j'ai subit une chirurgie plastique reconstructive sur ma main afin de rattacher les tendons et les nerfs à mes doigts. J'ai passé une seule journée à l'hôpital, probablement puisque je les suppliais de me laisser partir le plus tôt possible car je n'avais aucun moyen de contacter qui que ce soit et mon amie m'attendait à un point de rencontre à Los Angeles. Cette amie est la sœur cadette de mon ex petit ami qui s'est suicidé en Mars 2012, et c'était la première fois que je la revoyais depuis tous les événements malheureux de l'année dernière. Je n'avais vraiment pas envie de la laisser à elle-même dans un monde inconnu. Je me suis sentie terriblement coupable toute la journée .. elle avait fait 20 heures d'autobus et de train pour me rejoindre ... Terrible pour moi de ne pas être au point de rendez-vous, mais surtout de ne pas être en mesure de lui communiquer ce qui se passait!
 
Ce que je vis présentement
L'hôpital de San Diego ne m'a pas donné beaucoup d'information sur ce qui m'arriverait suite à la chirurgie. Je suis donc revenue à Québec, et devait me présenter à l'hôpital tous les jours au début, puis encore plusieurs fois par semaine jusqu'à présent. Je suis suivie en chirurgie plastique spécialisée, ainsi qu'en ergothérapie, ou je réapprend tranquillement à utiliser ma main. Un mois après l'accident, je n'arrive toujours pas à  plier mes doigts le moindrement ni à les redresser complètement. Je fais des exercices qui prennent environ 1 heure à compléter, toutes les heures, donc continuellement .. toute la journée. J'ai perdu tous les muscles du bras et de la main gauche, du poignet et des doigts, et mon bras est maintenant la moitié de sa taille normale. Suite au port de deux plâtres, je porte maintenant une orthèse, en tout temps, qui est irritante pour ma peau qui elle meurt et pleume de partout. Je suis incapable de trouver un emploi en raison du temps que je dois consacrer aux exercices d'ergothérapie .. qui me prennent en moyenne 7 heures par jour.. et quel travail pourrais-je faire aussi bien que quelqu'un qui a ses deux mains?! J'arrive déjà difficilement à m'habiller! Taper sur un clavier prend également beaucoup de temps et de patience, mais je refuse d'abandonner!Aujourd'hui, j'ai reçu de mauvaises nouvelles. Mes tendons se sont soudées à ma chair à l'intérieur de mes doigts .. et il est probablement trop tard pour être en mesure de plier la dernière phalange de deux d'entre eux un jour. Je garde espoir, mais je suis sortie de l'hôpital le coeur gros .. Je ferai tout mon possible pour qu'ils reviennent à la normale, mais ils sont assez enflés et je ne sens aucune force .. En fait, je ne ressens rien du tout peu importe ou je touche mon majeur et mon annulaire. Mais je n'abandonne pas, je garde espoir!
 
Le prix de ma main
Il y a quelques jours, j'ai reçu ma deuxième facture .. (la première étant 52,86 $ pour les radiographies) .. qui revient à 27 135,60 $ US, que je dois payer avant le 21 Février, sinon des intérêts seront ajoutés au montant. Ma carte de crédit est pleine, et ne pouvait encaisser que 5000 $ du total de toute manière. J'ai également 18000 $ à rembourser pour mes prêts d'études universitaires. Cependant, je ne serai pas en mesure de travailler avant encore 3 à 6 mois, dépendant de la progression de ma réadaptation.J'ai dû dire adieux à toutes mes activités de vie .. escalade, boxe, travail sur le terrain, rénovation, cheerleading, etc. Tout est dangereux parce que les cicatrices à l'intérieur de ma main pourrait rouvrir s'il m'arrivait de faire un mauvais mouvement. Je possède encore ma petite entreprise, mais je ne suis pas en mesure de prendre autant de contrats dont j'aurais besoin pour regagner ma vie.
Comment m'aider
Tout montant que vous pouvez donner, même 1 dollar, me rendrait tellement heureuse que des gens comme vous existent :) Je serais éternellement reconnaissante s'il y a des gens qui pouvaient m'aider à rembourser le prix de ma main, à racheter ma vie! Les gens qui m'entourent savent que je serai toujours la première à faire tout ce que peux pour aider chaque personne qui a besoin de moi, sans jamais rien attendre en retour, parce que ma principale raison de vivre est de rendre ceux que j'aime heureux!Je vous donne à tous le plus gros câlin ever!!

<h3>The walls that almost killed me</h3>
<p>When I was 20, they used to call me the tornado or the volcano as I was always full of energy and always laughing. Today, I still love to laugh, but my life has become so small because of my illness, that i barely have any social life at all...My condition is critical</p>
<p>I was exposed to mold for 13 years without knowing, as it was hidden between the walls of my bedroom. Since then, I suffer from some 40 chronic and debilitating symptoms that make my life a living hell. Mold attacks the nervous, hormonal, digestive, musculo-skeletal and immunitary systems. Mostly, I'm severely intolerant to all foods, and it takes me $1,300 worth of supplements every month in order to eat a few foods. Some of the symptoms are respiratory distress, pain, a noxious feeling, severe intestinal disorders, itching, and I also lose lots of hair, everyday from malabsorption, and have scalp burning symptom.</p>
<p>Mold disease is not recognized in Quebec, but it is in Ontario and the States where there are appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>In the last 13 years of my life, the cost of my survival has been an unskalable burden. I've spent at least $200,000 to relieve me from symptoms, and I'm now in great debt. Today, this kind of survival is senseless and my life has become too small.</p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, you are helping me to recover from this disease, and to give me my life back. I could finally contribute to society, as I am a skillful woman.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>According to the Environmental Health Association of Quebec, I need $30,000 to go through a protocol of treatments that would make me recover from my disease. The cost will go to the doctors consultation and treatments, plus travel and special accomodations, as I need a safe place because of my sensitivities. I would like to meet Dr Shoemaker or Dr. William Rea. You can visit their websites at: <a href=""http://www.survivingmold.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.survivingmold.com/</a> and <a href=""http://www.ehcd.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.ehcd.com/</a></p>
<p>My gift to you will be my neverending gratitude, and I will be posting videos on the progress of my healing process. I will also send you great karma! And if ever I'm totally healed and able to dance again (I was a professional dancer) I'll make a video of my dance and send it to you!</p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, I will still be needing money for my supplementation in order to survive. So I will still be immensefully thankful.</p>

<p>During the month of August Anna was traveling with a group of friends in Europe.<br/><br/> On August 17, 2012, she was on a board of “Adriatic Queen” catamaran in Croatian water.

During the month of August Anna was traveling with a group of friends in Europe. On August 17, 2012, she was on a board of “Adriatic Queen” catamaran in Croatian water. Unfortunately, Anna accidentally slipped off of a 3 meters high catamaran and hit her head on the ledge and fell into the ocean. She went unconscious instantly. Anna was delivered in an unconscious state by the helicopter to the casualty department of the brain neurosurgery hospital in Split, Croatia. Currently Anna is in a coma with internal brain bleeding and numerous head and face fractures. She hooked up to a life support machine and is in critical condition. Unfortunately, Anna didn’t have travel insurance and her family and friends do not have the financial capacity to cover the massive costs of treatment in Europe and transportation by Air Ambulance from Croatia to Toronto. Anna must remain in the hospital for seven to ten days in a state of total tranquility in order not to develop any air pockets in the brain. After that, if her condition will improve, she has to be transferred to the department of Neurosurgery into Toronto hospital facilities. The price for the Air Ambulance Worldwide is $ 93,550.00 USD, that must be paid as soon as possible to secure the transportation, without this Anna will not be able to travel back safely and it may cause her life. The price for the treatment in Croatian hospital is not fixed yet. PLEASE, HELP SAVE ANNA’S LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WITHOUT YOUR HELP SHE WILL NOT MAKE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<h3>I love my husband more than words can describe. He is my best friend and I can talk to him about absolutely everything. We are exactly one week shy of our one year wedding anniversary today and we want more than anything to have a baby together.</h3>
<p>My husband will be 39 in a few short weeks and I just turned 27 this year. My husband has three teenage children from a previous marriage and he had a vasectomy after his youngest was born, when he was 25. I have a 5 year old from a previous relationship. We would love more than anything to bring our two families together and have a baby.</p>
<p>Last August, we attempted a cycle of IVF but it was unsuccessful. We gave my body a rest and tried again in November and since this would be the last cycle we could afford we gave it our best shot and did everything to the tee. Rest, acupuncture, and lots of hope. It was a success! We found out just before Christmas that out dreams were coming true! All the pain and struggle has been worth it. I was pregnant! My son would be a big brother, which is what he said he wants to be when he grows up! As I neared the end of the first trimester I was finally starting to feel better as far as the pregnancy symptoms go. I was 14 weeks on my birthday, February 20 and I experienced some light spotting. I called my midwife nurse and we concluded that it wasn't serious because it was not a lot of spotting. At 12:03am the next day, I woke up screaming in pain and gushing blood. I knew what was happening and I was horrified! I had lost my baby on my birthday, and spent the entire next day sitting in a hospital room crying with my husband. Our dream had been shattered. We do not have the funds for another round of IVF and frankly, the whole experience has scared us from pursuing fertility treatments again, even if it were free.</p>
<p>We had considered a vasectomy reversal in the past but we were told the chances of success were very low given the age of my husband's vasectomy. Ever since this unfortunate loss of ours I have been having ahard time accepting that we have to just give up, so I again began researching a reversal in the hopes that we can find a way to make this happen, or at least try everything we possibly can.</p>
<p>I came across the website of a doctor in Oklahoma who performs reversals for a very low cost and he has a good success rate, even for vasectomies that are over 12 years old. It's certainly not a guarentee, but the risk is worth it to us.</p>
<p>The reason we are setting up this wonderful fundraiser is because we literally put everything we had into the unsuccessful IVF procedures. We spent quite a bit of money trying for this baby as well as a great deal of pain and stress and it ended in heart ache. We would love nothing more than to have a baby together and we feel that a reversal with this amazing doctor could be the answer!</p>
<p>The cost of the vasectomy reversal with this doctor is $1700 and that is his entire fee. The additional costs are for plane ticket(s) and lodging while we (or just my husband depending on funding) are in Oklahoma as we live in Upstate New York.</p>
<p>Please cosnider helping us with our journey! We can schedule the procedure as soon as we get the funds gathered. Thank you so much for hearing our story.</p>

<p>I am setting up this fundraiser on behalf of a good friend 
of mine, Josh Campbell. He is also my twin sister, Anita's, loving boyfriend.  
Josh was severally injured when he was 16, and his been wheelchair bound for 18 years. He is an incomplete C6-C7 quadriplegic, which means he has almost all feeling and usage from the chest and above. He has
 been wheelchair bound since the age of 16. Josh is an incredibly 
giving man, who has devoted much of his adult life to teaching and 
tutoring students in all areas of the sciences, as he has graduated from UCLA with a degree in microbiology, immunology, and molecular genetics. </p>
<p>In the last few years, his health has been on the decline.  The health decline 
has affected his level of Independence as well as his ability to work, 
which, in turn has taken a major financial toll on both him and my 
sister.  Reoccurring pressure sores on his body from years of sitting 
are a major source of his health problems.  An important solution to his
 pressure sore problem will be to have an electric wheelchair as 
opposed to a manual chair that is propelled by his arms.  Shearing forces from his body pushing the manual chair makes 
the pressure sores open wider and grow deeper. Basically; moving his 
arms, shoulders, and back cause his hips and butt to move back and forth
 in the chair, continuously opening the wounds. He often has pain in his
 shoulders and back region from 
all the pushing as well. They say it's like constantly doing push ups. 
This past May, Josh was bed ridden due to infection in one of his sores, and missed 3 months of teaching summer school classes.  Months without income caused all kinds of detrimental affects to this sweet couple, including several late and missed payments on important bills, and the unfortunate need to move out of their apartment. The sores have not 
disappeared and their is a constant threat of infection.  If they remain
 open they can get to a stage where they need 
surgery to help heal them, or worse, they could end up staying open 
forever. To say the least, they cause 
tremendous pain, and discomfort, and eventually could be life 
threatening.  The hopes is that having this electric chair will keep 
Josh out of bed, out of severe pain, allow his body to heal, and allow 
him to do what he loves, teach children 
chemistry/biology/physics/astronomy/math.  Josh is a much loved teacher, and 
truly missed when he can't be at school.</p>
<p>After much research, the quality chair 
that he has picked out is called a Quickie P-220 Power Wheelchair. To get a
 used version of it often costs more than $2,000. Here is a link to give
 you an example of what they look like: </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.marcsmobility.com/quickie-p220-power-wheelchair-used-power-chairs.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.marcsmobility.com/quickie-p220-power-wheelchair-used-power-chairs.html</a></p>
<p>Please
 feel free to research this brand and see how much more a new chair 
costs compared to the used chair we are looking to purchase.</p>
<p>The 
donation that you make will go directly to cover the cost of the chair. 
 We would like Josh to be moving in the chair as quickly as possible to 
give his sores a chance to heal, and to decrease his likelihood of 
further health complications and pain as well as missing anymore work.</p>
<p>If you are unable to contribute at this time, we understand! If you'd like, send healing thoughts to Josh, they always help!
 And if you can only spare a couple of dollars, there is no limitation 
to how quickly money can add up.  On behalf of both Josh and Anita, we 
thank you for taking the time to read this.  Also, feel free to pass 
this information on via any networking means you feel comfortable with. </p>
<p>A warm thank you to all,</p>Angela Bemi<br/><p></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Hello all,

that he has picked out is called a Quickie P-220 Power Wheelchair. To get a
 used version of it often costs more than $2,000. Here is a link to give
 you an example of what they look like: 
http://www.marcsmobility.com/quickie-p220-power-wheelchair-used-power-chairs.html
Please
 feel free to research this brand and see how much more a new chair 
costs compared to the used chair we are looking to purchase.
The 
donation that you make will go directly to cover the cost of the chair. 
 We would like Josh to be moving in the chair as quickly as possible to 
give his sores a chance to heal, and to decrease his likelihood of 
further health complications and pain as well as missing anymore work.
If you are unable to contribute at this time, we understand! If you'd like, send healing thoughts to Josh, they always help!
 And if you can only spare a couple of dollars, there is no limitation 
to how quickly money can add up.  On behalf of both Josh and Anita, we 
thank you for taking the time to read this.  Also, feel free to pass 
this information on via any networking means you feel comfortable with.

Add Drain rock to all the tees in need
There are more tee signs to be replaced
constant maintenance due to ever-increasing foot traffic as daily new disc golfers explore their obsession
the necessarily vigilant watch over erosion spots on the course
What we need:
Support through funding to keep the workers on the course part/full-time, providing for and serving the rapidly growing disc golf community in San Francisco and the greater Northern California region.
Through their tireless work and dedication, the Golden Gate Park Disc Golf Course will be the premiere free public course in the United States and the standard by which all other courses, private and public, will be judged in the future.
We've made great strides!
Planting grass in numerous locations to stop and control Erosion on our sand based course.
Purchased a truck to use for hauling and course maintainence, its already earned its place in the SFDGC Fam.
Erosion control on pathway on Hole 12
Drain rock placed around teepads #11 and #12 to stop flooding and mud tees.
The TEMPLE structure on Hole #11
The ""Great Wall"" on hole #6
Improved teebox area on #12
Drastically reduced play-through times on 11,12,14 with proper maintenance of the hill side.That is now covered in GRASS!!!
New Tee Signs!
More seating!
Erosion control tier on 18 to save main tree by the C pin.
...and last but certainly not least the course is continuing to get more GREEN!",0.0,0,"12 Campaigns

</h3><p></p>
<p></p>The first phase has begun: gathering background research from victims, law enforcement agents, prosecutors, advocates,
johns and convicted traffickers. I am based in Minneapolis/St. Paul, one of the U.S.'s top centers of trafficking -- where a strong coalition is coming together to better understand survivor stories; train advocates, hotel workers and police officers; and create best practices in this fight. I am participating in a conference April 24-25 where major players engaged in this issue will gather for the first time to share what they are learning.<br/><br/>The mission of my communication team is to further empower the critical mass of individuals and organizations now gathering to combat trafficking. Your support of the campaign outlined below will enable strong storytelling, with skilled presentation, so that advocates can extend their impact with greater legislative interest, public support for new policies, and community resources to help rescue and strengthen survivors. <b><br/></b><blockquote>
<b>""This country has more animal shelters than shelters for exploited children.""</b><br/>
</blockquote><b>The Book:</b> In-depth interviews have begun for a book that will explain how traffickers: 1) Select, 2)
Seduce, 3) Subjugate, 4) Package &amp; Deliver, and 5) Psychologically Control their victims. ""How I Sell Girls for Sex, in Five Easy Steps,"" is especially being written for community organizers, lawmakers and enforcement officers who don't have the base of knowledge that is developing in the Twin Cities.<br/><br/><b>Transmedia Project:</b> A central element of our campaign is the transmedia project, to be launched on <a href=""http:www.collectiveimpact.me"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CollectiveImpact.Me</a>, which is being developed to increase community awareness of how traffickers do what they do. <b>And this is where <i>you</i> come in. </b>As we begin deeper interviews with certain sources, we need funding to record victim stories in audio and to re-enact trafficker stories in video. Transmedia storytelling will enable people to <b><i>see</i> and <i>hear</i> how traffickers methodically prey</b> upon and disable the fragile minds and bodies of children. <br/><blockquote><b><span>“I was their Jesus and their savior, their knight in 
shining armor. I gave them food and shelter.” -- convicted sex trafficker<br/></span></b></blockquote>It will allow us to address misperceptions and misunderstandings about why girls and boys are ""allowing themselves"" to be sold. What physical and psychological abuse are they subjected to in order to be ""delivered willingly"" as products to johns? <br/><blockquote>
<b><span>One pimp estimated his girls were each generating at least a thousand dollars a
 day. His friends were allowed to gang-rape them for 
free. </span></b><br/>
</blockquote>The project will bring us behind the scenes so that this is no longer a story that happens to <i>other</i> people in other locations. How did a woman in a wealthy suburb sell neglected foster care youth out of her apartment without detection? How did an intelligent ROTC college student end up being trafficked for 10 years? How can it be that some victims actually <i>resist</i> being rescued?<br/><blockquote>
<b>A 15-year-old who tried to escape was burned alive in front of the other girls.</b><br/>
</blockquote>The horrors of sex trafficking deserve better story-telling. People are mobilizing around prevention, prosecution, and post-traumatic rehabilitation of survivors. It is time for us to help them.<br/><h3>The Budget</h3><p></p><p>Funding for the

I gave them food and shelter.” -- convicted sex traffickerIt will allow us to address misperceptions and misunderstandings about why girls and boys are ""allowing themselves"" to be sold. What physical and psychological abuse are they subjected to in order to be ""delivered willingly"" as products to johns? 
One pimp estimated his girls were each generating at least a thousand dollars a
 day. His friends were allowed to gang-rape them for 
free. 
The project will bring us behind the scenes so that this is no longer a story that happens to other people in other locations. How did a woman in a wealthy suburb sell neglected foster care youth out of her apartment without detection? How did an intelligent ROTC college student end up being trafficked for 10 years? How can it be that some victims actually resist being rescued?
A 15-year-old who tried to escape was burned alive in front of the other girls.
The horrors of sex trafficking deserve better story-telling. People are mobilizing around prevention, prosecution, and post-traumatic rehabilitation of survivors. It is time for us to help them.The BudgetFunding for the
various parts of this campaign will come from several sources, but IndieGoGo
donors are specifically contributing to these components:
FUNDED thanks to IndieGoGo donations: Audio
recordings of survivors, with editing to tell these stories via CollectiveImpact.Me. 
WHERE YOUR FUNDING WILL GO NOW: * Video
shot at a shopping mall (using actors), telling the story from the calculated view of a trafficker… how they scan a crowd, decide who to target, approach a victim, build trust, lure them in. 
* Infographic map that pinpoints details of arrests around the country – showing how pervasive the
industry is.* Art installation that replicates a powerful campaign executed in Scotland. Read about it here.TOTAL:

It can occur after you have gone through an extreme emotional trauma that involved the threat of injury or death.</p><p>Wikipedia defines them as: <strong>Airsoft</strong> is a sport in which individuals attempt to participate in the simulation of military combat also called MilSim or law enforcement-style combat; and <strong>MilSim</strong> is an abbreviation of Military Simulation, and refers to military simulations conducted by civilians for entertainment purposes.</p><p>Over the past couple of years an added benefit has surfaced from participating in this sport.  Military and law enforcement veterans have come forward with stories about how the MILSIM experience is helping with their PTSD symptoms.  I have been through the PTSD gauntlet myself, with my wife and with my brother - it's intermittent at best, therapists have no foundation to understand what veterans are talking about and the first course of therapy is drugs.  Right now there is little research being done on alternative coping mechanisms - this project will fund that research, increase awareness in a broader audience and hopefully help people understand what is going on within themselves and with others. </p><p>This may sound counter intuitive - that combat simulation helps combat veterans - but it works.  Ask any veteran what they miss most about their service and they will tell you it's the camaraderie.  This sport provides an outlet for their skills, energy and feelings in a familiar controlled environment.  MILSIM provides a similar bonding process and bridges the gap between civilian and military experiences.  This process creates a supportive and understanding network.  </p><p>This is not your typical airsoft competition; Operation Blacksheep is the marathon of the sport.  Operation Blacksheep is a squad based, 18+, 24 hour, force on force, objective oriented, continuous tactical simulation. </p><p>In the military we use the teminology - CRAWL, WALK, RUN.  We have observed the positve effects achieved through this experience by those who suffer from PTSD and have the testimonials from military and law enforcement veterans - CRAWL.  Your contributions will allow us to move into the WALK and RUN stages of researching, documenting and validating the benefits of the MILSIM experience.</p><p><strong>Just One of Many Testimonials:</strong></p><p>I first started playing Airsoft as something for my son and I to do together. The more and more I played it, the more and more I found it to be very therapeutic. I have gone from the simple spring guns to my favorite WE Tech M4 GBB. I changed to the GBB because it was as close to the real feel as I could get. I converted some of my friends from paintball to Airsoft and they love it. Some of them are veterans too and have also said how much it helps. </p><p>Don't get me wrong, I still have issues just like all us of do. This has allowed me to calm that inner calling I still have every day. Two weeks ago would have marked my 20 years. Unfortunately, a shattered ankle ended my career after only four years. It would be a great idea for the VA to sponsor something like this for all of us. I haven't found a form of therapy out there that works as good as this. Even friends of mine who have not served say that I have become a better person since playing and that's been three years now. </p><p>Keep up the great work. Hopefully we can get more people into this wonderful sport and expand it. I wish you the best of luck. </p><p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p><p>My wife and I are both retired US Army and PTSD has affected both of us and our<br/>family. There is no greater calling than serving your country. The selfless service to others. The comaraderie. The mission. The responsibility for people's lives and millions of dollars worth of equipment. The recognition and respect while in uniform everywhere you go. The deep sense of purpose in what you are doing. Being at the top of your game!</p><p>The military is fairly isolated in our society, with less than 1% of our population serving in military uniform. They - your employer, your family, your friends - don't understand what you did and don't know how or if they should ask you about it. They may even be hesitant to be around you. You are told to minimize your military experience on your resume. Employers can't translate your leadership, tactical and operational experience, skills and knowledge into something they can use. That sense of purpose is lost. ""The Hurt Locker"" is one of the best portrayals of this inner dilemma.</p><p>MILSIM (military simulation) to the rescue! It's not the combat simulation specifically and some may not be ready for that exposure yet - no one wants to relive combat. MILSIM offers the opportunity to put the uniform back on. To teach and lead a team. To share your experience, knowledge and skills with an eager audience. To push yourself and your team to their limits. To feel the camaraderie, teamwork and excitement of mission success. To regain that respect and honor on the field. To have an outlet for your feelings. To have a purpose. Through your efforts in this sport, civilians gain a deep respect for what you have done and understand how difficult it is to be in the military - if only for a moment they can walk in your boots.</p><p>I have been involved in this sport for 10 years and producing national level events for 6 years.  My goal from the very beginning was to give civilians a taste of combat so they could understand what military folks go through on deployment, the challenges of leading a team through a tactical scenario and the skills required to do it properly.   Operation Blacksheep is designed to challenge you on every level – mentally, physically, tactically and spiritually – in as real a combat environment that we can safely produce.

School, which only seemed like yesterday, I was associated with many 
children’s charities and organizations. Since then, I would do whatever 
it took to make sick children smile. Whether it be going to Macy’s and 
negotiating a deal for a hundred Max stuffed animals (Dog in Disney 
Little Mermaid), to dressing up in a panda bear costume or (see picture 
below), <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/273314/files/20131221150014-greg_panda_suit.jpg?1387666814"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>bringing gifts to the kids at Shriner’s Hospital. In addition, I also
 coordinated magic shows and toy drives for children in the hospital as 
well. Seeing their faces light up was like gold for me. My dream was if I
 had super powers … I would take away all the pain and sickness, keeping
 all children happy and out of hospitals and in the safe arms of their 
moms and dads.   
After graduation, I entered into the jewelry industry, learning the 
fundamentals and then finally becoming a jeweler. However, I didn’t feel
 complete, my passion is working with kids.  Therefore,  I decided to 
put my jewelry career on hold while I try to pursue my passion of 
working with children, making an impact / impression. That’s when I 
decided to start Juzt 4 Kidz. </p><p><b>MY VISION</b></p><p>
I wanted to create animal’s pillows that were cute, cuddly, and 
something different to attract our children’s attention but also make it
 practical for mothers and fathers. After researching for over a year, I
 have not seen a pillow that encompasses a 3-D character on a pillow and
 a blanket that is fully detachable with a removable cover to wash. 
After I confirmed that there was a void and niche opportunity in the 
child’s plush marketplace, so I started to doddle and came up with what I
 had first envisioned. 
The cow has always been a past time favorite to mothers and kids! I 
wanted to add in Mr. Bee, his outdoor buddy! <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/273744/files/20131221223238-1290-1.jpg?1387693958"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Our frog pillow really needed to have a bubbly character with big bright

 I created something soothing and friendly that had a bit of the good 
old days but included today’s technology. Something a child could relate
 to and carry it around like we all did, a favorite toy or a security 
blanket. Thus came the creation of Lullaby Light Up Pillows. 
It’s too easy for kids to pick up an IPad or an IPhone and play with it.
 However, for our little one’s it’s better to let them use what comes 
natural to them… their imagination and creativity.  With our patent 
pending technology, we have spared no expense in using the plushest 
material that are made from 100% polyester. We use the best quality 
speaker size for the sound and soothing array of LED lights that display
 iridescence rays of multicolor light.  We have followed the strictest 
U.S. guidelines for child safety including prevention of battery 
leakage, multicolor LED lights that do not overheat and no small parts. <br/></p><p></p><p><b>THE PRODUCT</b></p><p>
Our Lullaby Light Up Pillows encases 12 LED light bulbs stationed on a 
satin sheet inside the cushion. The LED light bulbs have a useful life 
of up to 50,000 hours. The benefits of LEDs are they use much less 
electricity than other bulbs, have extremely long useful lives, produce 
very little heat, do not emit UV or infrared, contain no mercury and are
 resistant to shock and vibration.
The filling we use is a PVC like material tested and approved by U.S. 
standards. Located inside the cushion is the IC chip which took my team 
and I numerous months to put together in a working function (See Pic

this past October, we’ve opened the door to a flood of inquiries from 
big box store buyers, independent retail buyers and to retail rep groups
 wanting to rep our line. We need your help. We have done our diligence 
in screening our manufacturers and who they have worked with. We WILL 
NOT tolerate child labor issues or low-quality work. Our current 
manufacturer works with Disney in Japan and Bed Bath Beyond here in the 
USA. We have factory team members who will quality check our 
merchandise, making sure they pass not only domestic standards but our 
own higher standards as well. Because we have chosen to use a reputable 
and reliable manufacturer, we must purchase their required minimum order
 quantities for each style &amp; color. Through the Indiegogo 
campaign, we are hoping to gain your support in satisfying the minimum 
order quantity, and to have the added capital for marketing and 
sampling. We also plan on attending more trade shows as well. By 
supporting us with your pledge, not only will you get one of our Lullaby
 Light Up Pillows, but you have the chance to give others a donation in 
YOUR NAME to a hospital we currently support! </p><p>We are proud to say that Juzt 4 Kidz currently supports Miller 
Children’s Hospital in Long Beach,Ca, Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital
 in Palo Alto, Ca, and currently negotiating with the women abuse 
center in San Francisco, Ca. Each quarter we donate a portion of our 
pillows to kids there. We need to educate and lead by example to our 
young generation that giving back to the community and kids in need is a
 great thing! As long as Juzt 4 Kidz is in business, helping kids will 
always remain a cornerstone for us. <br/></p><p>As soon as our project is
 funded, we will immediately go into production with our manufacturer.  
This process will take approximately 30-45 days upon receipt of our 
initial 75% deposit. Once our order is finished, the remaining payment 
balance of 25% needs to be paid. Once everything passes inspections, our
 order will be loaded onto a ship in a sealed container from Asia and 
will arrive approximately 4-5 weeks later pending weather and U.S. 
Customs. Our shipment will then be trucked over to our warehouse in San 
Francisco for our team to do the final assembling, packaging and 
shipping which should only take about a week. We estimate the last week 
of May 2014 as our ship out date for your rewards and donated pillows 
which will be by USPS (United States Postal Service).  We will keep you 
updated once we get closer to May 2014. <br/></p><p>We
 are hoping that with a successful Indiegogo campaign, we can fulfill 
our dream to get our Lullaby Light Up Pillows out to the retail and 
online markets. Sending samples to the different retail buyers across 
the country will be key in getting our product known!!
We also will try to comfort and calm kids with our Lullaby Light Up Pillows while during their hospital stay. With your validation we will

In High 
School, which only seemed like yesterday, I was associated with many 
children’s charities and organizations. Since then, I would do whatever 
it took to make sick children smile. Whether it be going to Macy’s and 
negotiating a deal for a hundred Max stuffed animals (Dog in Disney 
Little Mermaid), to dressing up in a panda bear costume or (see picture 
below), bringing gifts to the kids at Shriner’s Hospital. In addition, I also
 coordinated magic shows and toy drives for children in the hospital as 
well. Seeing their faces light up was like gold for me. My dream was if I
 had super powers … I would take away all the pain and sickness, keeping
 all children happy and out of hospitals and in the safe arms of their 
moms and dads.   
After graduation, I entered into the jewelry industry, learning the 
fundamentals and then finally becoming a jeweler. However, I didn’t feel
 complete, my passion is working with kids.  Therefore,  I decided to 
put my jewelry career on hold while I try to pursue my passion of 
working with children, making an impact / impression. That’s when I 
decided to start Juzt 4 Kidz. MY VISION
I wanted to create animal’s pillows that were cute, cuddly, and 
something different to attract our children’s attention but also make it
 practical for mothers and fathers. After researching for over a year, I
 have not seen a pillow that encompasses a 3-D character on a pillow and
 a blanket that is fully detachable with a removable cover to wash. 
After I confirmed that there was a void and niche opportunity in the 
child’s plush marketplace, so I started to doddle and came up with what I
 had first envisioned. 
The cow has always been a past time favorite to mothers and kids! I 
wanted to add in Mr. Bee, his outdoor buddy! Our frog pillow really needed to have a bubbly character with big bright
 eyes along with complimentary lily pads which would intrigue young 
kids. We all remember The Muppets and the iconic image of a frog.OUR MISSION
 I created something soothing and friendly that had a bit of the good 
old days but included today’s technology. Something a child could relate
 to and carry it around like we all did, a favorite toy or a security 
blanket. Thus came the creation of Lullaby Light Up Pillows. 
It’s too easy for kids to pick up an IPad or an IPhone and play with it.
 However, for our little one’s it’s better to let them use what comes 
natural to them… their imagination and creativity.  With our patent 
pending technology, we have spared no expense in using the plushest 
material that are made from 100% polyester. We use the best quality 
speaker size for the sound and soothing array of LED lights that display
 iridescence rays of multicolor light.  We have followed the strictest 
U.S. guidelines for child safety including prevention of battery 
leakage, multicolor LED lights that do not overheat and no small parts. THE PRODUCT
Our Lullaby Light Up Pillows encases 12 LED light bulbs stationed on a 
satin sheet inside the cushion. The LED light bulbs have a useful life 
of up to 50,000 hours. The benefits of LEDs are they use much less 
electricity than other bulbs, have extremely long useful lives, produce 
very little heat, do not emit UV or infrared, contain no mercury and are
 resistant to shock and vibration.
The filling we use is a PVC like material tested and approved by U.S. 
standards. Located inside the cushion is the IC chip which took my team 
and I numerous months to put together in a working function (See Pic 
Below).  Watch our video, with just a simple push of a button, it turns it on and
 off. It has an automatic cut off switch after approximately 17 minutes.We also made it where you can fast forward to the next song by pushing 
two clicks of the button. We have tested many speakers for the module. 
There was one that was smaller and cheaper with a better fit for our 
pillow, however the quality was not up to Juzt 4 Kidz standards. I 
wanted crisp and clean sound so I opted to use a slightly larger 
speaker, nothing bulky where it would interfere with kids laying on it. 
All our cushions are then sewn shut completely where a child can’t gain 
access to the inside. There is a separate compartment that holds the 
battery box. Lullaby Light Up Pillows uses 3AA batteries and has a cover
 with a screw to secure the batteries in place. Finally, what you see in our pictures and videos are real working prototypes!OUR BUSINESSIn October 2013 Juzt 4 Kidz made their debut at the ABC Kids Expo in Las Vegas. We had a fantastic time and networked with a lot of companies locally 
and globally. We met and talked with so many people who loved our

<p>
</p><p>Street
workout is a unique type of sport because it is available to every citizen of
the world, without any limitations or discrimination. It is based on exercises
using one's own body weight and resistance of gravity, using the environment
and infrastructure available:</p>
<p></p><p>- Push-ups</p>
<p>- Pull-ups</p>
<p>- Dips</p>
<p>- Sit-ups</p>
<p>- And much
more ... the basic movements are simple, but the progression is unlimited. </p>
<p>The
street workout movement is based on the idea that anyone can participate,
improve their physical form and health, and develop themselves. To maintain
motivation and a spirit of competition, World Street Workout and Calisthenics
Federation (“the Federation”) has founded a tradition of international
competitions. These competitions have gained an immense wave of popularity for
the street workout movement. Currently the only issue arises when competitions favor
those who can afford to pay their way to competitions – those who cannot cover
the cost of participation and living are unable to participate, thus coming in
conflict with the democratic ideals of street workout. To avert this issue, the
Federation has decided to implement a tradition not present in any other type
of modern sport in the world – a world championship and other international competitions
on the internet.</p>
<p>
Street workout is not just a sport, it is a lifestyle. It is the opportunity to
meet like-minded people, to unite and do something incredible, to motivate each
other. Street workout is a community. Street workout unites all races, genders,
social strata. Our social Project will bring this great movement much further by
giving everyone the opportunity to participate. </p>

will be created, where people will be able to participate in real World
Championship using their existing Facebook and YouTube profiles. The platform
will be accessible via web and as an application on handheld devices. Thus
everyone will have a chance to apply and compete on a global scale at no extra cost.
Challenge motivates and inspires to develop oneself. Practicing sport reduces
negative tension, increases overall health condition and helps staying focused
towards one’s goal. Street workout facilitates teamwork and creates new
friendships. These benefits will contribute towards increasing the quality of one’s
life and development of a better civic society. </p>

The total costs of the Project are 48000 EUR which consist of the following main
positions: </p>
<p>1) Development
of the IT solution, Project webpage and applications - 8500 EUR;</p>
<p>2) Development
of the platform’s design - 1500 EUR;</p>
<p>3) Technical
equipment needed for running the platform – 7000 EUR;</p>
<p>4) Platform’s

<p>6) Constant

<p>Development
of the platform is only the first of the Federation's projects aimed towards
using internet for worldwide popularizing of the healthy lifestyle and raising
the importance of exercising in people's lives. The Federation has other

Federation is a non-governmental, non-for profit organization. The Federation
receives no income, apart from limited donations from the personal funds of its
Management Board. There are no commercial sponsors or financial investors
behind the Federation. None of the Federation’s employees receives salary – all
of them are pure enthusiasts doing their work for free. The Federation unites
people and organizations who love what they are doing and want to make the
world better by their work. It is already a phenomenon of 21<sup>st</sup>
century how the organization with no money available has managed to organize 3
international Street Workout World Championships in 2011, 2012 and 2013 and
Street Workout World Cup 2013 series in 8 countries around the world thus
motivating millions of youth to follow and join the Street Workout movement. </p>

require your support. We believe that this is a great idea which will provide
youth the world over, especially those limited financially, with the
opportunity to compete internationally, to become stars and to change their
lives for the better. This is why we invite you to support us.</p>

to start implementation of the Project.</p>
<p><b>What if you raise more than the specified amount?</b></p>
<p>In
case of surplus the money will be used for further improvement of the Project. There are also charges applied by Indiegogo and Paypal so we will actually receive less than the raised amount. Apart
from the intended Project the Federation does far more towards worldwide
development and promotion of street workout as a social movement, lifestyle and
sporting activity. Therefore the money will be used by the Federation to carry
out its daily work – promoting healthy lifestyle, building new training places (accessible
free of charge) worldwide, motivating and educating children and youth, etc.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/567846/files/20140509040031-CF_4.JPG?1399633231"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p><p></p>

Clients who need a place like Liberation Barbell. Who demand it. Today, my waitlist is too full to accommodate everyone without a physical space to make it happen. Through my personal journey, I understand this need.</p><p>Growing up, I was an indoor-kid. I wasn’t into physical activity at all and was much more comfortable reading books in my room than breaking a sweat on the playing field. I felt awkward in my body and school gym classes were a complete nightmare that I made up every excuse possible to not have to participate in. When I eventually turned to fitness, I did so with a compulsive need to shrink myself. Coupled with an eating disorder, this was brutal.

It will be simple (no machines, only free weights) but will have everything you need to get super buff with all the nicest stuff.</p><p>In addition to open gym hours and classes, we will host olympic and powerlifting seminars and a multi-gendered, body positive powerlifting team.

Many people come to me because they’ve had negative experiences with other trainers. Because they feel unwelcome in every other space they’ve been to.</p><p>When we begin work together, they feel great. They are empowered. And they want more.</p><p>Liberation Barbell would have a threefold impact:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Meet the growing demand of a body positive fitness community. </strong>This community is growing. A physical space is crucial because there are so many people who want in. I currently have more people on my waiting list than I could possibly hope to see on a one-on-one basis. I want to help meet this demand by creating a home for body positive fitness in Portland.</li>
<li>
<strong>Create the first space of its kind, size, and quality for all bodies.</strong> For many, the gym is not a safe or empowering space. Liberation Barbell would meet this need, bringing body positive trainers, classes, and gender neutral changing rooms and shower spaces to this city. Its equipment will be as high quality as its functional fitness philosophy. And it’s the first space run by me and my team; I have a proven track record of making body positive fitness thrive as a business.</li>
<li>
<strong>Set a national example for a new kind of fitness.</strong> This movement stretches far beyond Portland. Through my community networks, I have met dozens of people who crave this kind of space in their town. The generous media coverage I have already received about my businesses tells me there is an international hunger for this kind of project. Liberation Barbell won’t just be a flash in a Pacific Northwestern city. It will ignite new possibilities for body positive fitness across the world.</li>
</ul><p>Liberation Barbell will be a place to get buff! It’s also a jumping off point for a new kind of fitness. Fitness that is about building you up, not tearing you down. We demand a work-out space that celebrates our strengths <i>and</i> our weaknesses. We don't have to be perfect to deserve fitness.</p><p>If you live in Portland, get ready for a new space where you’ll feel safe and strong in a different kind of fitness community. If you don’t live in Portland, get ready to support a gym that will ignite a ripple effect across the world. (And come visit sometime!) Together, we can create a new fitness movement for all bodies regardless of size, ability, age or gender.</p><center><a href=""http://tinypic.com?ref=23h9fe1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Image and video hosting by TinyPic"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i66.tinypic.com/23h9fe1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></center><p> </p><center><a href=""http://tinypic.com?ref=2lqa79"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Risks, challenges and the badass team to deal with it all"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i64.tinypic.com/2lqa79.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></center><p>There are many hurdles to opening a physical space, but we know we are buff enough to jump ‘em.</p><p>The most pressing challenge is securing the real estate for this dream. Once we have successfully raised the funds to lease a space, the rest is easy.</p><p>Why so sure? We’ve got a great team. Together, we combine lifting experience, business savvy, and a deep love for our mission.</p><p>Let’s start with me: In addition to successfully running two businesses (Super Strength Health and Rise and Resist podcast), I have hustled for years and am damn good at it. I have successfully met crowdfunding goals before with our campaign for <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/riseandresist"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the Rise and Resist Podcast Patreon,</a> built an overwhelming demand for health and wellness clientele, and created international community through speaking, blogging and leading workshops around my story.</p><p>And I’m not doing this alone. My business partner Christina Cabrales, is an expert in program and project management. She has worked in start-up environments, created and delivered multiple technical trainings, and has led teams to successfully crush their professional goals. Christina’s incredible organization and people skills are perfect to keep the Liberation Barbell client experience 150% awesome.</p><p>When building our business team, we knew we wanted to live the Liberation Barbell mission through who we recruited. We have carefully built an incredible team of entirely women and queer small business advisors, attorneys, designers, contractors, and accountants.</p><p>We acknowledge risk and challenge, and firmly believe we are the people for this job.</p><p>If you’ve ever been body shamed, felt insecure trying to start your fitness routine, or dealt with self-hating internal dialogue, I encourage you to donate.

Let’s work out together-- not out of self-hate, but as a way to love and appreciate the current bodies we have.Join me in creating a brand new body positive gym in Portland, Oregon.  I know firsthand the need for this kind of space. I’m a personal trainer. I’m a health coach. Every day, I work with clients of all body types who are new to fitness because it has never felt like a place for them. Clients who need a place like Liberation Barbell. Who demand it. Today, my waitlist is too full to accommodate everyone without a physical space to make it happen. Through my personal journey, I understand this need.Growing up, I was an indoor-kid. I wasn’t into physical activity at all and was much more comfortable reading books in my room than breaking a sweat on the playing field. I felt awkward in my body and school gym classes were a complete nightmare that I made up every excuse possible to not have to participate in. When I eventually turned to fitness, I did so with a compulsive need to shrink myself. Coupled with an eating disorder, this was brutal. My journey to health has been about rebuilding my picture of wellness piece by piece.Community became one of my biggest tools to get there. I founded my businesses Super Strength Health and the Rise and Resist Podcast on the belief that there is no wrong way to have a body. The friends I have made through this journey have helped me as much as I have sweat, lifted, and ate vegan snacks with them.This community is important. It exists way beyond me and my clients. And it needs a home. Liberation Barbell would be the headquarters for bodies of all types and other body positive trainers like myself. It will be a home for the new and emerging narrative against the status quo of fitness.This dream can be ours. But only if we start today.Liberation Barbell will exist because of the growing demand for a body positive fitness space in Portland, OR. But building a gym is a big deal. This will only work if we summon the badass, grassroots support of our powerful bodies and dollars combined.Your support will help cover these basic needs:
Equipment
Ability to secure a lease
Business insurance
Modest employee startup salaries
Startup marketing costs
Our Indiegogo goal is $25,000. To meet the total funding need-- about $100,000-- we’re turning to medium and large investors in our community.This spacious facility will open in Inner East Portland. Expect lots of windows for that small smidge of sun Portland gives us nine months a year. Expect best-in-its-class Rogue equipment. It will be simple (no machines, only free weights) but will have everything you need to get super buff with all the nicest stuff.In addition to open gym hours and classes, we will host olympic and powerlifting seminars and a multi-gendered, body positive powerlifting team. There will be clean, organized, equipment-and plenty of it.When fundraising is complete, we’ll get to work with securing the space, starting the buildout, ordering the equipment, creating a marketing presence, and continuing getting the word out as fast as possible!When you donate, you are directly supporting a space, equipment that helps us to put in the work and to make modifications easy for beginners, insurance, and for the hiring of body positive coaches and trainers.In exchange for your donation, you will get perks the Liberation Barbell way. Get stoked for nutrition plans, lifting plans, the SuperTasty Anti Inflammatory cookbook, a drop-in class, snack boxes, a pre-paid membership, an AMAZING RIP Patriarchy T-shirt by artist Sarah Gottesdiener,  a lifetime membership, and major high fives. You will gain the satisfaction of knowing that you’re helping not just to build a space, but also to change the world.  Every day, I spend amazing time with clients of all body types helping them reach their fitness goals. Many people come to me because they’ve had negative experiences with other trainers. Because they feel unwelcome in every other space they’ve been to.When we begin work together, they feel great. They are empowered. And they want more.Liberation Barbell would have a threefold impact:

Meet the growing demand of a body positive fitness community. This community is growing. A physical space is crucial because there are so many people who want in. I currently have more people on my waiting list than I could possibly hope to see on a one-on-one basis. I want to help meet this demand by creating a home for body positive fitness in Portland.

Create the first space of its kind, size, and quality for all bodies. For many, the gym is not a safe or empowering space. Liberation Barbell would meet this need, bringing body positive trainers, classes, and gender neutral changing rooms and shower spaces to this city. Its equipment will be as high quality as its functional fitness philosophy. And it’s the first space run by me and my team; I have a proven track record of making body positive fitness thrive as a business.

Set a national example for a new kind of fitness. This movement stretches far beyond Portland. Through my community networks, I have met dozens of people who crave this kind of space in their town. The generous media coverage I have already received about my businesses tells me there is an international hunger for this kind of project. Liberation Barbell won’t just be a flash in a Pacific Northwestern city. It will ignite new possibilities for body positive fitness across the world.
Liberation Barbell will be a place to get buff! It’s also a jumping off point for a new kind of fitness. Fitness that is about building you up, not tearing you down. We demand a work-out space that celebrates our strengths and our weaknesses. We don't have to be perfect to deserve fitness.If you live in Portland, get ready for a new space where you’ll feel safe and strong in a different kind of fitness community. If you don’t live in Portland, get ready to support a gym that will ignite a ripple effect across the world. (And come visit sometime!) Together, we can create a new fitness movement for all bodies regardless of size, ability, age or gender. There are many hurdles to opening a physical space, but we know we are buff enough to jump ‘em.The most pressing challenge is securing the real estate for this dream. Once we have successfully raised the funds to lease a space, the rest is easy.Why so sure? We’ve got a great team. Together, we combine lifting experience, business savvy, and a deep love for our mission.Let’s start with me: In addition to successfully running two businesses (Super Strength Health and Rise and Resist podcast), I have hustled for years and am damn good at it. I have successfully met crowdfunding goals before with our campaign for the Rise and Resist Podcast Patreon, built an overwhelming demand for health and wellness clientele, and created international community through speaking, blogging and leading workshops around my story.And I’m not doing this alone. My business partner Christina Cabrales, is an expert in program and project management. She has worked in start-up environments, created and delivered multiple technical trainings, and has led teams to successfully crush their professional goals. Christina’s incredible organization and people skills are perfect to keep the Liberation Barbell client experience 150% awesome.When building our business team, we knew we wanted to live the Liberation Barbell mission through who we recruited. We have carefully built an incredible team of entirely women and queer small business advisors, attorneys, designers, contractors, and accountants.We acknowledge risk and challenge, and firmly believe we are the people for this job.If you’ve ever been body shamed, felt insecure trying to start your fitness routine, or dealt with self-hating internal dialogue, I encourage you to donate. Every single dollar towards this gym supports body positive fitness internationally.Liberation Barbell will light a fire in many hearts across the world. That goes beyond the physical space. It’s also about building a movement. Here are some ways you can help build the movement:

<h2><strong>Yes, a painless cure for cancer</strong></h2>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Cancer hurts entirely too much. And so do the treatments.</strong></p>
<p>Before we start, I'd like to share with you the words of C. A. Calhoun, M.D. They are cause both for celebration and for rioting in the streets. Dr. Calhoun worked at the famous cancer M.D. Anderson when he visited Revici's hospital, the <em>Instituto de Biologia Aplicada </em>in Mexico City.</p>
<p>Here is what he wrote about his investigation there:</p>
<p><em>""But the thing that impressed me more than anything else is the fact that <strong>every person in this institution</strong> is free of, or practically free of pain without the use of narcotics.""</em></p>
<p>Revici had the same kind of results only better when he set up a new hospital in New York.</p>
<p>Dr. Lawrence LeShan, who was doing independent research at the NY hospital, told me this after he visited another hospital cancer ward for further research...</p>
<p><em>""I forgot how much pain there is. I was absolutely shocked by the amount of pain there was at a very good research hospital. They were screaming in the halls. They were tearing up sheets. With Revici, which were really all terminal cases, there was very little pain at all.""</em></p>
<p>The shocking part of all this is that Dr. Calhoun wrote his words <em>68 years</em> ago. That's why I said his words could cause rioting in the streets...because this safe and effective treatment has been kept away from you and your family.</p>
<p>LeShan's experiences came in the 1970's. So the pain reducing cure was continuing to touch a handful of lucky patients.</p>
<p>As you probalby know, sooner or later the pain from cancer can only be described by moaning, plus the treatments you have access to aren't any better. </p>
<p>That's why I'm both extemely fed up and excited at the same time. I'm fed up that this pain reducing treatment that shrinks tumors has been withheld from you. Perhaps you have had family members who were forced to deal with the unrelenting pain.</p>
<p><strong>But I'm excited that a platform like Indiegogo is going to enable us to end the suffering and end the pain - finally!</strong></p>
<p>So why has no one told you this before?</p>
<p>The only thing standing between our present state of affairs of incredible pain and suffering and being pain free is outreach.  </p>
<p>The Painless Cancer Project will allow me to shout this news from the rooftops, so to speak. The Project will allow us to be touching 100X as many people as I have been able to talk to before. The vision is that no one in your family will suffer like cancer patients do now.</p>

<p>In case you're wondering about the book, a reader just wrote an unsolicited comment in the comments section about it:</p>

<h3>About me and The Doctor Who Cures Cancer</h3>
<p>Hi ... my name is Kelley Eidem, and I’m the author of <strong><em>The Doctor Who Cures Cancer</em></strong>. I actually slept on a friend’s couch for two years to get this book researched and written. I also travelled to six states, and interviewed lots of former cancer patients and doctors.</p>
<p>After that, I cured my own Stage 4 cancer in two weeks.</p>
<p>So I know what it is like to be faced with cancer first hand. it's no wonder then  that my passion for years has been to help you and your family to overcome this scary diagnosis. Cancer doesn’t scare me. To me, it can be easy to eliminate if you know how.</p>
<p>But doesn’t your heart go out to all of the people here facing the challenge of cancer! Me, too. I just want to tell them there is real hope. And not only that, this particular hope reduces your pain instead of increasing it while you get well.</p>
<p>I hope you can give to all of the ones who are suffering here, and to my project, too. In a sense, when you invest in me, you’re giving to all of them.</p>
<p>Before we get started, what if you and I could create a whole new way of treating cancer in clinics across the country and the world, eliminating pain and shrinking tumors, and we could do it for the cost of one cancer patient’s treatment for one month?</p>
<p>Would you be all in? Of course you would.</p>
<p>BTW, I also have some wonderful gifts for you to thank you for your help, but more about that later.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Doctor Who Cures Cancer </em></strong>is already starting to make waves.</p>
<p>My book has touched a few thousand readers so far, and is now ready to go to the next level. Even with a relatively small readership, the book has made a positive impact already. In additional to saving lives, here are three more wonderful developments…</p>
<ul>
<li>Professor Mark Noble, who is a world-renowned neuroscientist, told me personally he changed the direction of his research completely after reading my book. <br/>  </li>
<li>
<strong><em>TDWCC</em></strong> is the inspiration for a clinic and lab being set up in South Africa with doctors to be mentored in how to use the medicines and the method. A successful engineer named Frikkie van Kraayenburg stepped up on his own and started the project. <br/>  </li>
<li>There is also talk of a similar arrangement in the Philippines. A successful importer/exporter named Manuel Kiok wants to create the same situation in his part of the world.</li>
</ul><p>If these exciting developments are occurring just from a few thousand readers of <strong><em>The Doctor Who Cures Cancer</em></strong><em>,</em> how much more would happen with your helping me to reach 100X as many people!</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>My goal is to cure cancer painlessly...</h3>
<p><strong>What if we get a hundred scientists like Professor Noble and a couple hundred new clinics opened in the next five years!</strong></p>
<p>I have a plan to make it happen … hundreds of clinics, with thousands of doctors trained in the Revici Method. Don’t worry, this isn’t some grand scheme. Rather people get inspired when they read <strong><em>The Doctor Who Cures Cancer</em></strong> and they take action!<strong></strong></p>
<p>So that’s why I want to take this 10 or even 100 levels higher or more. Imagine what would occur with 50,000 readers of my book.</p>
<p>One attorney actually contacted me about optioning the book for a movie! I expect more movie offers in the future. That could mean 20 million moviegoers discovering this incredible story.</p>
<p>I’ve always believed that a cure for cancer will become widely available to us quickly when too many people know the truth. ;-) That’s why your help is the key to our victory over cancer. You donation could tip the scales. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<h3><strong>The nitty gritty details</strong></h3>
<p>My plan is threefold. Most of the success of <strong><em>The Doctor Who Cures Cancer </em></strong>has come about through word of mouth. I don’t even have a central website other than a sales page! Many readers have bought additional copies to share they were so inspired by my book.</p>
<p>The days of no website are over. I need to set up a site where readers like yourself can ask questions and discover what they need to benefit their own health. For instance, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">How I cured my own Stage 4 cancer</span>.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be great to have that information? It’ll be on my website. :-)</p>
<p>I’ve tried building a website on my own and failed miserably. So I need to hire a real webmaster. For the many interactive features I need, the cost would be about $2,800 plus $1,200 webmaster maintenance for the first year, or $4,000 total.</p>
<p>I’ve invited Lynne August, a physician who worked with Dr. Revici, to be a contributor to the site. She has accepted. I plan to invite more physicians I know to be additional contributors.</p>
<p>The second critical part of this project is to reach hundreds of thousands of lay people and doctors so they can find out about <strong><em>The Doctor Who Cures Cancer</em></strong><em>.</em> Up until now, it has taken me six years just to get a list of 6,000 subscribers. That’s entirely too slow to produce the major change I’m talking about. <strong>I want doctors calling me every day to inquire about training.</strong></p>
<p>The quickest way to explode my list of readers is to start hiring list brokers. List brokers would enable me to reach hundreds of thousands, or even millions of lay people and doctors who are interested in the topic - without spamming - in mere months.</p>
<p>I’ve known about the incredible effectiveness of lists rentals for the past year but have been unable to take advantage of this valuable resource due to the cost of getting started. Alone, I can’t do it. But together, you and I can make it happen.</p>
<p>The estimated costs of developing the lists are about $2,000 a month on average. It might take six months to fine tune the lists for a total of $12,000. The good news is that once the operation is rolling along, the process can be self sustaining and expand rapidly.</p>
<p>Another $5,000 is needed for a copywriter to modify a sales page into a video format.</p>
<p>I've also come upon a method for using Facebook in a truly viral fashion. The cost of that is $296 the first month and $97 each additional month. The first year's expense would be $1,363. </p>
<p>I have the option to use Facebook advertising in conjunction with the viral Facebook program. My budget calls for $1,000 a month with the first year advertising spend being $12,000. </p>
<p>Together the total needed is $42,199 including fees paid to Indiegogo. If the total donations exceed our goal, the money will be used to reach even more families with cancer faster.</p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<h2><strong>What we will accomplish together...</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>This project takes less money than two months of cancer treatment for one person!</strong></h3>
<p><em><strong>For about the same cost of one or two months of treatment for one person with cancer by an oncology team</strong></em>, <em>The Doctor Who Cures Cancer</em> could bring forth relief for thousands or even millions of cancer sufferers around the globe and in your hometown.</p>
<p>Instead of traveling to New York, you or your family member could go to someone nearby if need be.</p>
<p>Let me mention at this point that<strong> Dr. Revici also developed effective remedies for migraines, drug addiction, and alcoholism to name a few of his many achievements. </strong></p>
<p>So your assistance will touch many lives whether it be cancer, drugs, alcohol, AIDS, etc.</p>
<p>Experience has shown that <strong><em>The Doctor Who Cures Cancer</em></strong> changes people. They no longer fear cancer. That outcome in itself makes the book worthwhile.</p>
<p>But now you can change 6,000 readers into 60,000 in mere months, and 600,000 in a couple years. That means clinics opening all over the globe…and maybe in your city too.</p>
<p>But it won’t happen without your donations. Or to put it in a positive light, it starts with your generous help.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Now about your rewards…</strong></h3>
<p>I have lots of rewards because I’ve invented a few wonderful remedies that’ll knock your socks off. For instance, from what people with pain have told me, I invented a pain spray that works better than any narcotic for eliminating a variety of pains – far better, in fact. One lady told me it took away her PMS pain and her daughter's, too!</p>
<p>I’m also the author of ""<strong><em>It’s Not Just For Sex</em></strong>: how to lower your blood pressure using a Nobel Prize winning discovery even if you don’t have ED.""</p>
<p>Why pay $10 or more for pills that can cause instant blindness when for nickels a day, you could take care of your ED and/or your blood pressure?</p>
<p>I also have one treasured copy of the first edition of my book for a very special donor autographed by Dr. Revici, where he used his nickname. It is the only copy in existence signed by him with his family nickname.</p>
<p>I'm willing to give away everything in return for your support because this goal is so important to me.</p>
<p>So take a look at all of the rewards over on your right and pick the ones that are right for you.</p>
<p>(There might be a duplication of each offer. Please ignore that quirk.)</p>

The quickest way to explode my list of readers is to start hiring list brokers. List brokers would enable me to reach hundreds of thousands, or even millions of lay people and doctors who are interested in the topic - without spamming - in mere months.
I’ve known about the incredible effectiveness of lists rentals for the past year but have been unable to take advantage of this valuable resource due to the cost of getting started. Alone, I can’t do it. But together, you and I can make it happen.
The estimated costs of developing the lists are about $2,000 a month on average. It might take six months to fine tune the lists for a total of $12,000. The good news is that once the operation is rolling along, the process can be self sustaining and expand rapidly.
Another $5,000 is needed for a copywriter to modify a sales page into a video format.
I've also come upon a method for using Facebook in a truly viral fashion. The cost of that is $296 the first month and $97 each additional month. The first year's expense would be $1,363. 
I have the option to use Facebook advertising in conjunction with the viral Facebook program. My budget calls for $1,000 a month with the first year advertising spend being $12,000.

What we will accomplish together...
This project takes less money than two months of cancer treatment for one person!
For about the same cost of one or two months of treatment for one person with cancer by an oncology team, The Doctor Who Cures Cancer could bring forth relief for thousands or even millions of cancer sufferers around the globe and in your hometown.
Instead of traveling to New York, you or your family member could go to someone nearby if need be.
Let me mention at this point that Dr. Revici also developed effective remedies for migraines, drug addiction, and alcoholism to name a few of his many achievements. 
So your assistance will touch many lives whether it be cancer, drugs, alcohol, AIDS, etc.
Experience has shown that The Doctor Who Cures Cancer changes people. They no longer fear cancer. That outcome in itself makes the book worthwhile.
But now you can change 6,000 readers into 60,000 in mere months, and 600,000 in a couple years. That means clinics opening all over the globe…and maybe in your city too.
But it won’t happen without your donations. Or to put it in a positive light, it starts with your generous help.
 
Now about your rewards…
I have lots of rewards because I’ve invented a few wonderful remedies that’ll knock your socks off. For instance, from what people with pain have told me, I invented a pain spray that works better than any narcotic for eliminating a variety of pains – far better, in fact. One lady told me it took away her PMS pain and her daughter's, too!
I’m also the author of ""It’s Not Just For Sex: how to lower your blood pressure using a Nobel Prize winning discovery even if you don’t have ED.""
Why pay $10 or more for pills that can cause instant blindness when for nickels a day, you could take care of your ED and/or your blood pressure?
I also have one treasured copy of the first edition of my book for a very special donor autographed by Dr. Revici, where he used his nickname. It is the only copy in existence signed by him with his family nickname.
I'm willing to give away everything in return for your support because this goal is so important to me.
So take a look at all of the rewards over on your right and pick the ones that are right for you.
(There might be a duplication of each offer. Please ignore that quirk.)

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In the beginning of the summer, I was a 26-year-old woman trying to get by, just like most. After having spent the last three years basically starting over from scratch in a new city, things were looking up. I was finally getting somewhere with my Pastry and Baking degree with a new job in a new bakery, had just found an amazing roommate, and started up with the urban farmstead thing. I had just left one job and had a few weeks' break, and just enough money, before starting the next one. I was using the time to work on myself personally as well as in my relationship with my boyfriend, Matt, who moved just this year to Portland from Virginia to be with me after years of dating long-distance. We were just getting ready to enjoy our first summer together in the three years we've known each other, when the accident happened.</p>
<p>On July 4th, Matt and I were invited to a party at a park just a few blocks from my house, so we rode our bikes over to join the festivites. During the course of the evening, a slackline was set up between a tree and one of the park's cement light posts. No one realized how bad the condition of the lamp post was, and when the line was being checked out for stability, the cement lamp post<strong> cracked, separated from its base,</strong> and came tumbling down. <strong>Onto my head</strong>.</p>
<p>The metal-and-glass lantern on the top of the post connected directly with my forehead, lacerating my scalp (which received four staples); the top of the cement post landed on my thigh, which knocked me over (and left two <strong>large lacerations that needed about 30 stitches</strong>), and caused a<strong> broken fibula and foot bone as well as torn ligaments in my ankle and foot</strong>. The impact from hitting the ground has affected my shoulders and back, making it painful to get dressed or use crutches or even sit up in bed for too long. I have bruises from head to toe, and myriad other scrapes that didn't require stitches. The severtity of the break in my ankle, coupled with the ligament damage, required surgery to fix and over two weeks of keeping my leg elevated for 23 hours a day minimum.</p>
<p>If I had been standing just a few inches in the wrong direction, the post would have landed directly on my head and I probably wouldn't be able to type this right now. <strong>I'd be a vegetable</strong>, at best. So I realize how lucky I am to have gotten away with so little harm. However, because I'm unemployed and worked in a food cart for the last 1.5 years, I don't have health insurance (and haven't in about three years at this point). I have applied for Medicaid, but the state of Oregon works on a lottery system still, so there's a <strong>one-in-thousands chance</strong> that I'll get chosen, and the likelihood is that I won't receive state help. I have applied for assistance from the hospital, but that only covers a portion of the care I received from them. And, perhaps the part that hurts the most, because of the kinds of injuries I have, I had to quit my new job before I even started it, and there aren't many jobs in kitchens or bakeries that I can do while I recuperate; there's not much else I'm qualified to do. The doctor's office has <strong>estimated 15 weeks before I go back to work,</strong> a business-as-usual, 8-hour workday, 40 hours a week. This is where you come in.</p>
<p>I need help paying my medical bills. As it stands,<strong> I have about $127 left</strong> in my bank accounts after spending the end of June unemployed and paying bills for July. Matt, my wonderful boyfriend and now-caretaker, has promised to help, but on his salary working in retail, there's not much to draw from. Our families will support us as best they can, but the fact of the matter is, even with our combined efforts, <strong>we can't do this alone.</strong></p>
<p>There's a long road ahead of me, <strong>including physical therapy</strong>, maybe for up to a year, and possibly other surgeries. On top of paying the hospital bills I've already incurred, I've also had to purchase a wheelchair, crutches, and shower chair, not to mention various other items to make personal hygiene possible. The funds I hope to raise with this campaign will make a dent in those expenses and others to come (physical therapy, specifically). This has been a life-altering injury, but with the funds I raise here, I can get back on my feet</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>As it stands, the financial burden resting on me is $35,271, not including the most recent doctor visit where I received an air compressing boot and had stitches removed. Here's a breakdown of what I owe and to whom:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emergency Room:
<ul>
<li>Exam, X-Rays, bone-setting, and stitches: <strong>$997</strong>
</li>
<li>Radiology (6 CT scans, 3 X-Ray): <strong>$1,291.22</strong>
</li>
<li>Hospital stay (including room and board): <strong>$14,627.08</strong>
</li>
<li>Ambulance service: <strong>$973.56</strong>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Surgery:
<ul>
<li>Hospital stay (I didn't stay overnight this time): <strong>$14,937.31</strong>
</li>
<li>Orthopaedic services: <strong>$555</strong>
</li>
<li>Anesthesiologist: <strong>$1890</strong>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
Incidentals (stuff I've already paid for):
<ul>
<li>A shower chair for bathing: <strong>$45</strong>
</li>
<li>Wheelchair rental:<strong>$75 a month (with elevated leg rest)</strong>
</li>
<li>Various prescription refills: <strong>$70</strong>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>There are still some bills floating around out there that haven't made their way to me yet regarding the surgery: they just started arriving today. As you can see, <strong>$15000 isn't going to cover everything</strong>. It's less than half of what I owe, but it'll get me on the right track. With your help, I can get back to the life I've worked so hard to make for myself.</p>
<p><strong>What You Get</strong></p>
<p>I know that, often, people in my situation say that the reward will be in knowing you've helped someone's life better, and it's true:<strong> if you decide to support me, you'll make my suddenly-painful life a lot easier</strong>. The thing is, I want you to know how much your support means to me. I want to give back to you in whatever way I can, because you chose me, out of so many other campaigns, and if there's anything I can do to make it worthwhile, I'll do it.</p>
<p>Fortunately for you, I am something of an artist. I'm not the biggest news on the block, but I've got a little skill in the stationary department, and whole lot of supplies. As some are already aware, <strong>I make postcards</strong> (some of which you can see over at <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Shenanigans-Ink/166205153466046"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Shenanigans-Ink/166205153466046</a>). Starting with the beginning of this campaign, I'll make custom-desiged sets of <strong>10 postcards for each donation over $50</strong>, <strong>sets of 5 for each donation over $25, single postcards for each donation over $10, and custom minis for donations of $5.</strong> The designs for each group will be posted as I make them, and they'll probably change as time goes by, but you're guaranteed something hand-made by me, from scratch. I've had people frame the postcards and keep them around the house, but they're mail-worthy and delightful, and my way of saying <strong>THANK YOU!</strong></p>
<p>As a donor, of course, you'll also be entitled to updates as I recover, but that may not be as exciting as postcards.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When I moved to Portland, I invested everything I had into making it work. I took my old life apart, sold what I could and gave away the rest. I had recently lost my mom, and was on the verge of losing my childhood home, as well. I took out massive student loans to make my dream of attending pastry school come true. I have scraped and scrimped and lived in dubious homes and eaten nothing but rice with Tony Chachere's for months. Through hard work, I graduated from culinary school, got myself a job, and then another one, and then another one, all in an economy where people with more expensive educations couldn't get jobs. I was paying my loans, making my rent and all my other bills. I even started to accrue savings for the first time in years. I felt like a real person.</p>
<p>After all this time struggling to make my life as an adult feasible, it takes a great deal for me to ask for help. I wish more than anything that I could do this on my own. I want to walk again so badly that I dream about it at night. But I can barely afford the prescriptions they give me, to say nothing of the doctor visits still ahead of me. I need your help to get the care I need to get back to my life. I cannot state more emphatically how much it means to me that you've read this far, and what it would mean if you donate.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Of course, I know what it means to be poor. I've been poor most of my life. If you can't donate, then help me get the word out. Talk about it to people you know, or people you don't know, and share. If they can't donate, ask them to spread the word, too. We can still work together to meet my goal. It means just as much to me to know there are some people out there, cheering me on.</p>

<h3>Waiting Isn't An Option</h3>
<p>If you watched the video, then you already know my son died from brain cancer. It is heart-wrenching losing a child. What makes it worse is not knowing who might be next. Brain cancer doesn't discriminate and they don't know what causes it. So we may never have it affect our family again - or it could take someone else close to me. I don't want to wait to find out. I want to stop this disease NOW. Before it takes someone else I love. Before it takes someone YOU love.</p>
<p>I have spent most of my life working in some sort of service. Key Club in high school, Paralyzed Veterans as a working adult, and PTA as a mom. I never had a true focus or passion until I saw how vastly under-funded brain cancer research is and how much help they need.</p>
<p>I found some other people here in Wichita who are excited to help me with this cause, but brain cancer awareness month is coming up fast. We are too late to get on most corporate budgets for this year, but we didn't want to let the chance to do an event go by. We've pooled our resources and are seeking corporate sponsorships to make the concert a reality, but it isn't enough. We need more funding to ensure that we not only cover expenses, but can also make a sizeable donation to research.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need to cover the expenses of the concert so we can donate all of the money from ticket sales to research. We have gotten a lot of ""gift in kind"" donations that have helped us with some of the expenses. Here are the projected expenses we will still need to pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theater rental $1,000</li>
<li>Professional Sound Tech &amp; Equipment Rental $800</li>
<li>Professional Stage Hands $158</li>
<li>Ticketing Fees (assuming 800 tickets sold - theater holds 1293) $1,320</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Get The Ball Rolling</h3>
I have done many fundraisers throughout the years, and the first year is always the hardest. Once people see an event is successful, they want to be a part of it. We are confidant we can put on a fabulous event that will have everyone coming back for more! We just need your help to get this first year event off the ground.</div>

<p>Over the past four weeks, attacks by the Israeli army in the Gaza strip
have resulted in the injury of over 10,000 Palestinians and the deaths of 1,800- and counting. The UN
reports that the vast majority of fatalities have been civilians including over
1300 children; and many women and the elderly.</p><p>Some 425,000 Palestinians - a quarter of Gaza's population - have been displaced by fighting, the UN says.<br/></p>
<p>Hospitals, clinics and medical facilities have sustained
extensive damage. On 21 July, the third and fourth floors of Al-Aqsa hospital
were targeted, destroying the emergency, orthopaedics and surgical departments,
and intensive care unit. Operation and procedures ceased due to lack of oxygen.
At Al Wafa Medical Rehabilitation hospital, 17 patients in critical condition
were evacuated before it too was bombed on 23 July. In addition, the Balsam
Hospital suffered damage to the paediatric and surgery departments, and CT Scan
and X-Ray facilities.</p>
<p>As air and ground attacks continue, the remaining medical
facilities face critical shortages in medical supplies and equipment, and struggle
to treat the wounded who are mostly civilians, many of them children.</p>
<p>The Emergency Relief Committee of the Galilee Society, in
cooperation with Physicians for Human Rights – Israel (PHR<u>-Israel</u>), seek
donations to purchase and deliver urgently needed medical supplies for Gaza
hospitals. We have received directly from the hospitals an itemized list of the
products needed, including for example bandages, pain medication and specific equipment.</p>
<p>Your support will not only help ease suffering and save lives
but it will also show solidarity with the people of Gaza - that they have not
been forsaken by the world. </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>For eight years the Gaza strip has suffered a blockade and
severe restriction on the freedom of movement and the import of many goods, including
urgently needed supplies. Before the Israeli operation began, hospitals in Gaza
were not well equipped but now the situation is desperate.</p>
<p>Every donation, no matter how small or large, will help us reach
our target of $100,000 and go directly to purchasing and delivering critically
needed medical supplies and equipment to save the lives of children and civilians in
Gaza.</p>
<p>Our colleagues in Gaza described the situation as heart breaking.
Patients suffering extreme pain from severe injuries are often not offered pain
medication simply because it is unavailable. Further, there is an acute shortage
of nutrition and fluids, antibiotics, insulin and anticoagulants and basic
medical equipment to measure blood pressure or blood glucose are no longer
available.</p>
<p>Usually here we should offer you ‘perks’ for supporting this
campaign. No t-shirts or post cards here, your perk is simply knowing that you
are directly contributing to ease the suffering that is happening right now in
Gaza.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>The attack on Gaza could be described as “shooting fish in a
barrel” – it is often referred to as one of the most densely populated places
on earth, with closed land, water and air borders, and no opportunity for
people to seek safe shelter anywhere. The number of civilian casualties has
been estimated so far at 70% of total casualties – innocent children, women and
people who wanted no more than to live life in dignity and peace.</p>
<p>Both the Galilee Society and PHR-Israel have extensive
experience working in conflict environments and delivering medical aid. For
example, during the severe winter of 2013/14, the Emergency Relief Committee of
the Galilee Society delivered aid to the Syrian refugee camps in Jordan valued
at more than $200,000 (20,000 blankets and 60 tons of winter clothing). In
recent days PHR-Israel facilitated the delivery of over $200,000 worth of
medicines and medical supplies into Gaza.</p>
<p>However there are still critical shortages. Your support will
enable us to keep delivering this humanitarian aid and show the Palestinian
population in Gaza that they have not been forgotten.</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>

<br/><p></p></div>","Summary
Over the past four weeks, attacks by the Israeli army in the Gaza strip
have resulted in the injury of over 10,000 Palestinians and the deaths of 1,800- and counting. The UN
reports that the vast majority of fatalities have been civilians including over
1300 children; and many women and the elderly.Some 425,000 Palestinians - a quarter of Gaza's population - have been displaced by fighting, the UN says.
Hospitals, clinics and medical facilities have sustained
extensive damage. On 21 July, the third and fourth floors of Al-Aqsa hospital
were targeted, destroying the emergency, orthopaedics and surgical departments,
and intensive care unit. Operation and procedures ceased due to lack of oxygen.
At Al Wafa Medical Rehabilitation hospital, 17 patients in critical condition
were evacuated before it too was bombed on 23 July. In addition, the Balsam
Hospital suffered damage to the paediatric and surgery departments, and CT Scan
and X-Ray facilities.
As air and ground attacks continue, the remaining medical
facilities face critical shortages in medical supplies and equipment, and struggle
to treat the wounded who are mostly civilians, many of them children.
The Emergency Relief Committee of the Galilee Society, in
cooperation with Physicians for Human Rights – Israel (PHR-Israel), seek
donations to purchase and deliver urgently needed medical supplies for Gaza
hospitals. We have received directly from the hospitals an itemized list of the
products needed, including for example bandages, pain medication and specific equipment.
Your support will not only help ease suffering and save lives
but it will also show solidarity with the people of Gaza - that they have not
been forsaken by the world. 
What We Need & What You Get
For eight years the Gaza strip has suffered a blockade and
severe restriction on the freedom of movement and the import of many goods, including
urgently needed supplies. Before the Israeli operation began, hospitals in Gaza
were not well equipped but now the situation is desperate.
Every donation, no matter how small or large, will help us reach
our target of $100,000 and go directly to purchasing and delivering critically
needed medical supplies and equipment to save the lives of children and civilians in
Gaza.
Our colleagues in Gaza described the situation as heart breaking.
Patients suffering extreme pain from severe injuries are often not offered pain
medication simply because it is unavailable. Further, there is an acute shortage
of nutrition and fluids, antibiotics, insulin and anticoagulants and basic
medical equipment to measure blood pressure or blood glucose are no longer
available.
Usually here we should offer you ‘perks’ for supporting this
campaign. No t-shirts or post cards here, your perk is simply knowing that you
are directly contributing to ease the suffering that is happening right now in
Gaza.
The Impact
The attack on Gaza could be described as “shooting fish in a
barrel” – it is often referred to as one of the most densely populated places
on earth, with closed land, water and air borders, and no opportunity for
people to seek safe shelter anywhere. The number of civilian casualties has
been estimated so far at 70% of total casualties – innocent children, women and
people who wanted no more than to live life in dignity and peace.
Both the Galilee Society and PHR-Israel have extensive
experience working in conflict environments and delivering medical aid. For
example, during the severe winter of 2013/14, the Emergency Relief Committee of
the Galilee Society delivered aid to the Syrian refugee camps in Jordan valued
at more than $200,000 (20,000 blankets and 60 tons of winter clothing). In
recent days PHR-Israel facilitated the delivery of over $200,000 worth of
medicines and medical supplies into Gaza.
However there are still critical shortages. Your support will
enable us to keep delivering this humanitarian aid and show the Palestinian
population in Gaza that they have not been forgotten.
Risks & Challenges
While entering Gaza at the moment is not easy, it is possible,
and PHR-Israel have facilitated the delivery of two trucks of medical aid in
recent weeks. It has the necessary expertise and resources to rapidly purchase medical
equipment and deliver it to Gaza.
Other Ways You Can Help
If you cannot make a donation at this time, spread word of the
campaign through social media and tell your friends and family about it. It all
makes a difference.

<p><span>After a year of development and testing, our prototype is finally ready. We will use Indiegogo’s funds to begin production and make the AirVisual Node a reality.</span></p>
<p>At this stage, time is our only source of uncertainty.  We are currently trying to finalize and perfect our mold, which is the biggest cause of any potential delay in our timeline. While we don’t foresee any direct risks, we acknowledge that there may be unforeseen obstacles that can interfere with getting the AirVisual Node into your hands on time.</p>
<p>We hold our product to the highest quality standards. As a result, we will not ship a product until the AirVisual Node meets our standard of excellence, after thorough QA/QC testing.</p>
<p><b>Important things to note -</b></p>
<p><b>1) Minor changes in user interface design -</b> we are currently working with a graphic designer to improve our user interface (to be released soon). Our device screens will undergo some small changes. These changes will be purely aesthetic and will not influence the quality of information that’s being displayed.</p>
<p><b>2) China resident restrictions for information sharing - </b>government restrictions prohibit residents of China from sharing outdoor air quality information publicly.  China residents will be able to enjoy all the features of the AirVisual Node, but will not be able to place their station outdoors and broadcast the air quality.</p>
<b>3) Outdoor data for select cities only -</b> AirVisual reports outdoor air quality data for more than 5,000 cities worldwide and our coverage grows every day. Unfortunately, we still lack data from areas that do not have monitoring stations.

<p>Battery life is dependent on variables such as screen brightness, connectivity, and the sample rate for taking air quality readings.  Based on these variables, your device could last anywhere from 4-6 hours.</p>
<p><b>How is Artificial Intelligence used in the AirVisual Node? </b></p>
<p>AirVisual uses Machine Learning, a subset of Artificial Intelligence, for a variety of purposes including forecasting air pollution movements, validating data points, and the sensor calibration.</p>
<p><b>Why doesn’t the device take VOC’s into account?</b></p>
<p>While exposure to VOCs is a health concern, the AirVisual Node does not include a VOC sensor because VOC cover a wide range of compounds, some harmful and some not. AirVisual has researched over 20 different VOC sensors and as of yet, there are no low cost sensors that provide accurate values. Accurate VOC sensors sensitive to particular compounds cost over $500. AirVisual keeps monitoring the development of VOC sensors and we’re confident some technological breakthrough will occur in the next few years.</p>
<p>One way to protect yourself from indoor VOCs is to frequently ventilate your environment. The AirVisual Node CO2 sensor shows you when your air is confined and more subject to a VOC threat.</p>
<p><b>Why did AirVisual make the decision to create a stationary, rather than portable, air quality monitor?</b></p>
<p>Air quality is incredibly dynamic.  In order to employ artificial intelligence technologies we needed a stable environment that our computers could learn from.  A portable device lacks consistency and makes it difficult to recognize trends in one’s environment.  Because we wanted our monitor to provide insights to help users improve their air quality, we needed a stationary device to determine actionable solutions.</p>
<p><b>What are the temperature and humidity sensors used for?</b></p>
<p>The temperature and humidity sensors gives you information on your environment’s well being. Environments that are too dry can cause throat and skin problems while environments that are too humid are at risk for mold.</p>Temperature and humidity can also affect the accuracy of laser-based PM2.5 air quality readings.  As a result, the AirVisual device has been carefully calibrated, using our own “secret” algorithm, to take these factors into account in order to provide the highest level of accuracy possible.  </div><div>
<p><span><b>How does AirVisual collect real-time data? </b></span></p>
<p>AirVisual uses new laser technology to provide live air quality readings.  Within milliseconds time these readings are automatically calibrated to account for temperature, humidity and outlying data points.</p>
</div><div>
<p><span><b>Is AirVisual suitable for outdoor environments? </b></span></p>Yes. The AirVisual monitor is a technologically advanced tool. In order to get the most accurate and detailed information from outside, it’s important that weather doesn’t interfere.  When you set up your outdoor device, make sure that it is protected from exposure to water, strong wind and direct sunlight, and has access to an electrical outlet.  Optimal locations for your device include a shaded porch or roofed balcony.

Check out the world's best CO2 & PM2.5 sensor here.


 
 

 
AirVisual Node is a smart air quality monitor that displays immediate, accurate air quality data both indoors and out, to help you create healthier, more productive environments.

As the most precise consumer air quality monitor on the market, the Node displays real-time PM2.5 and CO2 levels by combining laser technology and artificial intelligence. We made the device to pack all the essentials you need to breathe clean, healthy air.
The AirVisual Node was designed to medical-grade standards in order to be of special benefit to those who suffer from asthma, COPD, lung cancer and high blood pressure.  Use the AirVisual Node to instantly see invisible threats in your air and understand where they come from.  Take control to ensure you and your loved ones are breathing healthy air wherever you go.  
 

 

Every day, we make conscious decisions about the food we eat, the calories we burn, and the hours we sleep. The air we breathe has always been perceived as beyond our control - until now.
  

 




 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
With the AirVisual Node you can track a ubiquitous, invisible threat both indoors and out.  The device will provide actionable insights and advices to help you optimize your health wherever you are.
 

 
Turn Insights into Actions

 
   
 

 


 
 
Currently AirVisual monitors and forecasts air quality for more than 8,000 locations around the world.  This intelligence is already offered for free on the AirVisual app and website.  Check it out!
 
 
 

Your AirVisual Node will connect to our established platforms to provide you with enhanced features, including:
 


Health Recommendations: to lower your health risk and improve your well-being.


Advanced Analytics: Detailed figures on 6 key pollutants for 8,000+ locations in 35+ countries.


Air Pollution Community News: to keep you up-to-date on air pollution news and medical findings. 


Get the free app today to view air pollution and weather forecasts worldwide:                                                       

There are still many places that lack local air quality monitoring stations. By placing your Node outdoors under protected, shaded areas, you can become an air quality data source for your local community. 


 
 

At AirVisual, we share a vision where everyone has access to clean, healthy air.  However, we need help from the global community to realize this. When you purchase the AirVisual Node, you add another data point to our crowd-sourced world air pollution map. Together, we analyze and share air quality information around the world to help people, businesses and governments implement change.




Our prototype is ready for production: We have already partnered with manufacturers that are qualified to produce medical-grade equipment and are waiting to finalize the monitor’s external mold before starting mass production.

Within the first 48 hours of our campaign, we reached our initial goal.  We have since added the below stretch goals to keep the momentum going!  The more crowd-funding we secure, the more we can give back! 


Help us reach 20,000 USD and we’ll offer “over the air” software update so you can get the latest UI and calibration mechanisms with the click of a button. - REACHED
At 30,000 USD we’ll donate Phnom Penh, Cambodia their first ever outdoor PM2.5 air quality monitoring station.  - REACHED
At 40,000 USD and we’ll provide a widget that you can add to your webpages to display the current air quality of your Nodes surroundings.  This is particularly useful for businesses like coffee shops, gyms, schools, hospitals, etc. - REACHED
Get us to 50,000 USD and we’ll offer an API so that you can create your own applications to use the data. - REACHED
When we reach 70,000 USD  we'll give you the ability to use the Node to connect to your smart home devices (IFTTT support).  This will allow you to create action based rules for air purifiers and humidifiers, etc. 

 
 




 
 




 

 

We are a global team hailing from 6 countries in 4 continents, dedicating our work to 1 overarching goal: to empower everyone to breathe clean, healthy air. 


 
After a year of development and testing, our prototype is finally ready. We will use Indiegogo’s funds to begin production and make the AirVisual Node a reality.
At this stage, time is our only source of uncertainty.  We are currently trying to finalize and perfect our mold, which is the biggest cause of any potential delay in our timeline. While we don’t foresee any direct risks, we acknowledge that there may be unforeseen obstacles that can interfere with getting the AirVisual Node into your hands on time.
We hold our product to the highest quality standards. As a result, we will not ship a product until the AirVisual Node meets our standard of excellence, after thorough QA/QC testing.
Important things to note -
1) Minor changes in user interface design - we are currently working with a graphic designer to improve our user interface (to be released soon). Our device screens will undergo some small changes. These changes will be purely aesthetic and will not influence the quality of information that’s being displayed.
2) China resident restrictions for information sharing - government restrictions prohibit residents of China from sharing outdoor air quality information publicly.  China residents will be able to enjoy all the features of the AirVisual Node, but will not be able to place their station outdoors and broadcast the air quality.
3) Outdoor data for select cities only - AirVisual reports outdoor air quality data for more than 5,000 cities worldwide and our coverage grows every day. Unfortunately, we still lack data from areas that do not have monitoring stations. To see if your city is covered, visit https://airvisual.com/world

<p>Then to make matters worse I won't even have a car to sleep in with my cat because they are repossessing it due to non payment anytime now. I just need this help until I can get back to work and slowly try to catch Up on my bills.</p>
<p>Please help me ! Even if everyone can just donate $5 that will help me keep from losing my trailer and allow me to eat. That is my priority right now not losing my home.</p>

Maybe you can feel it, too. The time for herbal medicine is now.Do you have a vision to revolutionize healthcare? Are you working to connect people with plants in your community? Are you ready for a wellness system focused on the health of people and planet?We believe that herbal medicine has a vital role to play in the emerging integrative healthcare system. We're excited to be a part of this work and we know that, together, we can seed the growth of a system that is grounded in nature, empowers individuals and connects communities.Everyone's contribution is necessary. The work you do in your community is the foundation of this grassroots movement. We'd like to offer support, if we can (check out the project consultation perk for ideas). Any donation you make will also support the work we do to provide direct care in our community and to educate skilled herbalists who work on the front-lines in kitchens and clinics nationwide.
Here's how we're working towards change:
Re-skilling our community, one person at a time. We inspire individuals to take care of themselves and their families and provide them with the knowledge and skills to do it. Individuals then become valuable resources in their local communities, too.Our tools:
an annual intensive gardening and medicine-making apprenticeship 
an ongoing schedule of community workshops and special events
learning gardens and a teaching kitchen
sliding-scale community herbal clinics, offering individuals education in self-care with herbs, diet and lifestyle recommendations
Seeding the culture with change-makers. We train clinical herbalists who take their knowledge and experience to communities across the country. These herbalists replicate and expand the educational work we do in exponentially widening circles.Our tools:
a three-year clinical herbalist training program
sliding-scale community herbal clinics in multiple locations, the primary training venue for clinical interns 
a professional lab and fully-stocked apothecary for intern use
Who we are:Vermont Center for Integrative Herbalism (VCIH) is an educational grasssroots non-profit, founded in 2007 by a group of experienced herbalists and activists, working through collaborative leadership to change what healthcare looks like. The founding directors are Betzy Bancroft, Larken Bunce and Guido Masé, who were joined later by co-director Laura Litchfield and outreach coordinator Lisa Weiss. Shona MacDougall rounds out the clinical staff, along with our directors, and Julie Mitchell, Iris Gage, Mischa Schuler and Joann Darling contribute their expertise as adjunct faculty. We also have a wonderful Board, led by Amy Goodman, supporting and guiding us.To learn more about our team, visit our website, www.vtherbcenter.org.
“I just wanted to thank you for your wonderful herbal clinic. The herbalists I met with were incredibly professional and quite astute as well. I feel nourished in a whole new way. The tinctures have been fabulous and not only do I feel the medicine of the herbs within, I feel the equally important good medicine of the people who made the tincture, just for me.”  VCIH  student clinic client


The impact we're making ~ the nitty gritty details:Since we began this work, we’ve been steadily increasing our impact both locally and further afield. Here’s a snapshot of some of what we’ve accomplished:Thirty individuals have completed our Herbs from the Ground Up gardening and medicine-making apprenticeship over the past 4 years. We've enrolled 10 more this summer. These students have the knowledge and skills to cultivate medicinal gardens and make herbal remedies for self and family-care.Ninety-nine people have completed our one-year Family Herbalist training program, and 30 more are currently enrolled. These individuals have the knowledge and skills to support their own and their families’ health using herbs, nutrition, and lifestyle choices. Approximately half of these students continue on to the Clinical Herbalist training program.  Our students come to us from our local and regional area, as well as all over North America.Thirty-one individuals have completed our 3-year Clinical Herbalist training program and 12 more are currently enrolled. These individuals have developed advanced clinical skills and return to their own communities prepared to offer herbal education and professional consultations to their community and work integratively with other health-care professionals.
“I’m so thankful to Larken, Betzy and Guido for forming an herb school 
that includes real clinical practice.They have trained 
us in every possible clinical scenario we could encounter as practicing 
herbalists.” Clinical Herbalist  program student
Since 2010, the professional clinic has provided 1828 hours of service, while our student clinics have offered 1620 hours of service, costing us approximately $152,000 to provide. Our professional practitioners are currently working with 496 individuals while our student clinics currently serve 308 individuals, with many others having passed through the clinic in the past 7 years. Many of these clients have taken advantage of our sliding-scale payment options to reduce the cost, and $26,695 worth of consultation time was provided as a gift, free of charge.The professional clinic provides observation opportunities for our clinical students in training, while our student clinic gives interns the chance to practice directly with clients under supervision for a full year. Of course, our clinics also provide one-on-one education to the clients seeking knowledge about taking care of themselves with herbs. It's a win-win experience.Since 2010, we’ve also provided $204,000 worth of herbal products to our community, all at two thirds of retail cost, or below. In fact, we’ve given away $58,000 worth of herbs since 2010 (an average of $15,000/year). Our apothecary provides both a direct source of herbs to our clients and a learning environment for our students. As with consultations, herbs are available to clients on a sliding-scale and as gifts, when needed.  Less easy to quantify, but no less important, have been our efforts in developing and enhancing models for accessible and socially just clinics, and in maintaining environmental sustainability alongside of growth. We've worked hard on payment policies that incorporate sliding-scales, the use of Time Banking and elements of gift economy. We are diligent in improving our delivery of herbal education in ways that reflect the creativity and diversity of the plants and our students. We seek to consistently enhance the quality of our own clinical practices and have developed methods for peer support and professional development. We share our work freely with our community through national teaching and international travel, as well as our organization's journal. We increasingly engage in research partnerships, as well as educational affiliations. We are also committed to our model of collaborative leadership, an ongoing experiment in complexity, care and visionary community. We invite you to visit our website for much more information about our community classes, training programs, herbal clinics and our mission and vision for herbalism and healthcare and for creating a revolution in plant-based wellness!Why we're asking for support:In 2013, VCIH doubled in physical size and student capacity and our provision of clinical services has grown along with our expansion. Students come to Vermont from all over the country to study with us. We’re excited to meet the growing demand for herbal education locally and nationally and we need your help to do it.We are asking for contributions towards our operating costs during this exciting period of growth. As we’ve expanded and the interest in our work and demand for our services and programs has increased, so have our expenses. At the same time, we are not yet at full capacity in terms of tuition revenue, which supports the rest of our work substantially. Our current projected deficit is $15,000 for this year. We expect to reach our enrollment goals in 2015, while also continuing to fine-tune our systems and budget in our new space, returning us to sustainability.Your contribution will specifically support the delivery of our Family and Clinical Herbalist training programs and the maintenance of the sliding-scale community clinics and apothecary that support them. This means paying faculty and clinical supervisors, maintaining our facilities and stocking the apothecary for this current fiscal year.We took a leap of faith to better serve our local and national communities and the students who come from far and wide. We believe a revolution is needed and we can help make it happen. We are confident that we will land on solid ground, but we need your support while we grow.What you get:The online fundraising model is based on giving ""perks"" in exchange for donations to support an organization's work. We hope you'll agree that we have a lovely list of these to offer you, donated to us by fantastic herbalists around the country. Read more below about the excellent folks providing these goodies and support their work when you can!We also want to be sure that we offer tangible resources for the work you are doing--so we've created perks that go beyond ""thank you"" and provide direct support on your projects and ideas.  You can choose to consult with one of our four directors, Betzy Bancroft, Larken Bunce, Laura Litchfield and Guido Masé on the topic of your choosing.

I'm Cassandra Tognoni! I'm a Transgender Cosplayer, Amtgard Nobel woman, and just an all around nice gal who hopes to achieve a sense of normality within my own mind, through Transitioning into a woman.

This campaign is for my first surgery, Breast Augmentation and the aim is to raise $6,000.00. I know this a large amount to ask for and if my goal is not met, the funds raised will still go towards the procedures mentioned, as I am saving myself as well.

<h3> </h3>
<p><strong>Our work is simple:</strong> We help women in remote, rural regions of Senegal, West Africa, experience healthy and joyful childbirth. Five women and 41 newborns die each day in Senegal due to complications related to pregnancy and childbirth. These sad statistics are preventable. With your help, we can fully staff community health workers in Saraya, Senegal, who will in turn provide quality care to mothers, resulting in long-term impacts to the community and economy.</p>

<p><strong>ABOUT WWHI</strong></p>
<p>• Every 90 seconds, a woman dies from pregnancy or childbirth-related complications. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">99% of maternal deaths each year occur in developing countries, such as Senegal.</span></p>
<p>• Our vision is that women and girls in developing countries have positive, healthy experiences with pregnancy and childbirth. That they know their options, can make their own choices, and can access quality care.</p>
<p>• Malaria is one of the leading causes of maternal mortality. Last year, WWHI launched a community-based malaria program that educates women of child-bearing age, as well as prevents and treat the deadly disease from killing them. Having enough trained local health workers is the number one priority in continuing this program.</p>
<p>-------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>OUR FUNDRAISING GOAL</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $8,000. By giving $700 for one health worker, we can provide access to healthcare to 152 women. If we can support 8 health workers with only $8,000, we will multiply our reach to 1,216 women. More than half of these very women have never accessed or had access to help. Can you imagine the impact on these women and their families?</p>

Hi, my name is Merril and I am a member of
the Moreton Bay Table Tennis Association Inc., based in Queensland, Australia.  

At our club, we are passionate about the cause of
women's table tennis and we don't believe we are the only ones.For too long the major prize money at Table Tennis events has gone to the men. While there is often a ‘Women’s
Only’ event in a tournament, the larger prize money and prestige is attached to
the men's events.  This just seems wrong to us, as we know the women work just as hard as the men.   
The Women's National Table Tennis Challenge demonstrates our desire to give women and girls, a tournament that
not only offers substantial monetary incentives for competitors, but also
allows them to enjoy being feminine.
Through your contribution we believe that the Women's
National will open the eyes of the public to a sport that is safe and fun for
women to play. We also believe that both the elite and aspiring club women of Table
Tennis in Australia, will feel valued and supported by the offering of a

<p><b>About Parkinson’s (PD) and Alzheimer’s
Disease (AD)</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">PD and AD are degenerative, neurological
disorders, which are characterized by the loss of neurons in the brain,
ultimately causing death over a period of 2 to 20 years. PD triggers motor
symptoms and cognitive impairment, ranging from mild memory difficulties to
dementia, and mood disorders, such as depression and anxiety. AD results in
loss of memory, cognitive functions, language skills, and behavioral changes. There
is no cure for these diseases, only symptomatic, temporary treatments. Approximately, 40 million people are affected by AD and further
7 million people by PD world-wide. </p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The global

The amount of money spent on funding research has been just one-hundredth compared to what we as a society spend on treating and taking care of
patients.  More innovative and high-risk research and clinical trials can
deliver highly sought after therapies and potentially a cure. However, not having enough funding for these activities have been limiting progress. Crowdfunding is an alternative

<strong>What is low immune function?</strong>
</h3>
<p>Low immune function refers to an underactive and poor performing 
immune system. The immune system’s prime function is to protect the body
 against infection and the development of cancer. Support and 
enhancement of the immune system is perhaps the most important step in 
achieving resistance to disease and reducing susceptibility to colds, 
flu and cancer. Supporting the immune system involves a 
health-promoting lifestyle, stress management, regular body movement, a healthy vegan lifestyle and the 
appropriate use of nutritional supplements and herbal medicines.</p>
<h3><strong>If you answer “yes” to any of the following questions, it is a sign that your immune system needs support:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Do you catch colds easily?</li>
<li>Do you get more than two colds a year?</li>
<li>Are you suffering chronic infection?</li>
<li>Do you get frequent cold sores or have genital herpes?</li>
<li>Are your lymph glands sore and swollen at times?</li>
<li>Do you have now or have you ever had cancer?</li>
</ul>
<p>Recurrent or chronic infections-even very mild colds-only occur when 
the immune system is weakened. Under such circumstances, there is a 
repetitive cycle that makes it difficult to overcome the tendency toward
 infection: a weakened immune system leads to infection, infection 
causes damage to the immune system, which further weakens resistance. 
Enhancing the immune system can provide the answer to breaking the 
cycle.</p>
<h3><strong>What causes low immune function?</strong></h3>
<p>The health of the immune system is greatly impacted by a person’s 
emotional state, level of stress, lifestyle, dietary habits and 
nutritional status. Nutrient deficiency is the most frequent cause of a 
depressed immune system. An overwhelming number of clinical and 
experimental studies indicate that any single nutrient deficiency can 
profoundly impair the immune system.</p>

<p></p>By supporting this project you will co create a sacred space that 
offers health education, self empowerment, body purification and healing to people who have 
experienced a compromised immune system due to multiple circumstances and various diagnosis of the mind, body and spirit who are seeking a holistic and effective approach to their 
situation.<p>
We are so grateful to you and your support ~Living Akashi<br/></p>
</div></div>","ImagineImagine lying in a hospital bed nearly 2,000 miles away from your home, in a tropical country, with no one to reach out to and being told by the local doctors that your immune system is dangerously low and would require an immediate blood transfusion.A frantic team of doctors persistently alerting you of the severity of your condition.  Weighing 337 lbs, exploding with mucus, 105 temperature, unable to walk due to exhaustion and extremely low potassium levels.While gazing out of the hospital, at the Caribbean sea,  a gentle voice whispers ""Nature will heal you"".  In that moment you  realize the gift and opportunity to connect with your ""true self"". You release yourself from the hospital in full confidence of an absolute recovery and begin the healing journey with Mother Nature. This is my true and ongoing story of how honoring my inner voice inspired me to take my health, mind and body to a higher level while sharing the gift of life with you!Health issues are directly linked to the lack of integrating a holistic sustainable approach to every day living.~Akashi

I Am Because Of You!

Living Akashi has touched the lives of a few thousand people in 300 homes, 35 states and 5 countries globally since 2010!Supporting others on their personal journey to wholeness by sharing the message of self love and how to align with it is the fuel that continues to charge my soul today.Living Akashi is a path to aligning ones self with your inner ability to heal which begins by making a commitment to live and live life abundantly.Daily commitment to eating vegan living foods, participating in mind/body therapy through meditation, yoga and intentional love, herbal compounds, a naturally healing environment and a guide to assist in your personal transformation is the Journi.
Realizing The Vision
After six years of global travel, experiencing very personal and intimate stories,  disheartening diagnosis and transformations to many, I Am now ready to realize my vision in an environment suited for healing.  In 2017,  I will launch my own sustainable wholeness community in the rich and healing parish of Portland, Jamaica. This community will include organic farming,  an herbal clinic, healing foods cafe, meditation and yoga center, arts and culture therapy space, outdoor spa, and nine cottages for long term healing therapy.This is The Living Akashi Transformation CenterI Am grateful to introduce a holistic platform to sustainable community development.   Our health is our greatest asset, make an investment that will return to you abundantly~Akashi 

   Our Goal & Gift To You

Sowing seeds of love into our Holistic Sustainable Community will transform the lives of the individuals that partake in this experience as well as the natives that live in Portland, Jamaica.  There will be opportunities for the natives to share their gifts of healing through their ancient and passed down knowledge of the healing powers of herbs, ital/natural plant based foods, the transforming powers of the waters, natural skin and body products and endless ways to align you with your inner power to heal yourself.  We currently hold retreats in this area and have access to many of the beautiful treasures that Portland has to offer however we do not own the land. This is what our campaign is about. We are prepared to make an offer this season and are here to raise additional funds to seal the deal!The total cost to purchase  the land, begin clearing and farming is $9,000.Several generous supporters have agreed to be present to assist by volunteering their time to farm, build and share their experience of ""how to create"" a sustainable community. We welcome you to join this effort!Please stand with us in our mission by giving whatever feels right 
for you. Share this project with all of your friends, family, social media connections and anyone who you know will benefit from what we are offeringDon't forget to select your perk on the right side bar by clicking on it -We have several exciting perks for our generous contributorsOne of my favorites:Contribute $9,000 and you will be buying into the land to use 10 consecutive days annually until 2022.  This part of the land is yours to use in accordance with holistic guidelines and keeping the integrity of this intentional community in tact.(Excellent Opportunity For Retreat Facilitators)The Land

concentration of negative Ions. That is why we feel even better on vacation.
Now, the Headoc brings Negative Ions to the palm of your hand.<div>

Headoc combines 3 technologies to address problems caused by modern lifestyle - in a simple and effective way.




Relieve problems that everyday people suffer from – almost every day.
Modern lifestyle leaves less and less time to relax, breathe and ease away the
stress gathered through the day. Stress, Headaches and Migraines have become so
common. In many cases, we tend to underestimate their effect on our life and even ignore it completely.

We feel stressed all the time. We want to meet expectations at work. We want to enjoy our free time to be with our family, meet our friends and visit our parents. We find ourselves working harder, for
longer periods. We forget that the more stressful and anxious we are – the
less productive we are. We find ourselves struggling to make the most out of our day, and forget that sometimes we need to pause and breathe.
Feeling good is important, and the Headoc is here to make sure you feel better.
 Anytime. Anywhere.







The technologies in the
Headoc are all aimed to fight stress, anxiety and migraines. Three technologies
working synergistically for optimal results in minimal time.
Behind the science - A
short review of the technologies: 


Negative ions are a
natural molecule found in nature which improves cognitive functions as well as affects
mood and depression.

Negative ions can be found
in the air around us at all times. When spread in to the air, negative ions
reduce depression, improve memory and enhance cognitive performance. Negative
Ions have a positive effect on decision making and concentration required by
the fast pace of modern lifestyle.

Environments with high
negative Ions have a positive effect on cognitive performance and mood.
Waterfalls, the Alps, the ocean and many outdoor sceneries offer high
concentration of negative Ions. That is why we feel even better on vacation.
Now, the Headoc brings Negative Ions to the palm of your hand.

Vibration has been proven
to be a stress relieving technique which also improves blood flow. The Headoc utilizes the
advantages of vibration therapy to assist with anxiety, pain and even improve
sleep. The Headoc vibration is soothing and relaxing, and also aids the effect
of the other technologies utilized in the Headoc.






 




The vibration’s intensity can be easily adjusted to suit a
volume you feel comfortable with. The Headoc’s vibration mode also allows use
of the Headoc as an applicator of creams or oils, providing a massage to the
skin which helps the cream enter the skin and pores. The cream applicator is a
standard part of the Headoc package, and can be used for beauty creams, massage
oils, and other ointments meant for skin application.

 Red light photo-therapy is proven to increase metabolism of
muscle and tissue. NASA has used photo-therapy as a main part of astronauts
care in space. Red light photo-therapy
is frequently used in beauty care. It is marketed in professional devices of
cosmetic care and home use devices. 








Red light treatments can improve skin regeneration, which
provides better composure of the skin as well as help minor wrinkles. In the
medical industry, red light photo therapy has many uses. Research has shown
that red light is linked with energy & metabolism in muscle, bone and other
tissue. Moreover, it has even been suggested that astronauts can use LED
blankets to prevent muscle and bone atrophy (degeneration of cells).

  The 3 technologies Headoc is using are not new technologies and are used in many applications separately. Each technology (Negative Ions, Red Light Photo-Therapy, and Vibration) is approved for use by the FDA, CE and others. The production used to make Headoc is according to ISO and GMP standards, and all materials used in Headoc are of medical grade. 


The Headoc is made from medical grade materials. The components inside were reviewed closely, and customized to provide optimal results. Each component is important to the effect the Headoc creates. Have a look at what's inside the Headoc:

The 3D model is interactive! Put your mouse over the Headoc and move it by yourself to see Headoc from all angles








  

 The Headoc has an accessory (cosmetic cap) that makes the Headoc perfect for application and introduction of creams, oils and ointments on to the skin to improve tissue penetration and creams' absorbency in the skin. 










We have the prototypes
ready. We have submitted a patent for the Headoc. The technologies used in the
Headoc are approved for use by FDA and EU. The Headoc’s concept is ready for
the next level.
The funding we receive
will be invested only into the Headoc’s production process and planning future
development of the Headoc. The funds raised will be used for:



Finalizing the Headoc’s design.


Preparation for mass production.


Purchasing the raw materials and components.


Manufacturing tools and molds required for production.


Establishing the production process and testing it.


Production!







 

Headoc was made to solve everyday problems, for the everyday people

Our friends and family are those everyday people, and so are you. They came to us asking for a solution for their everyday problems – stress and headaches. After our success with the Eardoc (a device for ear infections and ear pain), they hoped we could help them get some relief for those issues as well.


We pride ourselves in over
20 years of innovation and success in the healthcare industry. Our CEO &
founder has over 70 international patents registered to his name, used in
products sold to many large companies and users around the world.

Product handling and operation:


What conditions does Headoc treat?
Headoc combines three technologies, and each of them has its virtues. The Headoc’s main purpose is to relieve Headaches, migraines and stress. However, the technologies have vast effects, and are used in many products to treat other conditions. These include – fatigue, anxiety, short term mental distress, dizziness, cramped muscles. In addition, the Headoc has positive effects on memory, cognitive functions and skin regeneration.  


How does Headoc work?
Headoc uses a combination of three technologies. Each of them works individually, and they can work simultaneously. The Headoc works on a chargeable battery that lasts for several hours of constant use. The Headoc is charged by USB cable, connected to a computer or USB Charger. 


How long should I use the Headoc?
The Headoc can be used several times a day, for variable durations according to your needs. The effect of the Headoc will be felt within minutes. However, the recommended use is 5 minutes and up to 15 minutes for optimal results. The Headoc can be used for up to an hour. It is recommended to use the red light in intervals of 5-6 minutes.  


Are the Headoc’s technologies approved by health authorities?
The 3 technologies are not new technologies and are used in many applications separately. Each technology (Negative Ions, Red Light Photo-Therapy, Vibration) is approved for use by FDA, CE and others. The materials used in Headoc are of medical grade. 


Is Headoc safe?
Headoc is safe for use if instructions are followed.


Who can use Headoc?

<p><strong>My name is Emma Boyd. I am a freshman at the University of Texas at Austin, and for the past year I have been Marley Bedford's personal babysitter.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Marley is the most incredible little girl I have ever known. Here's why:</strong></h3>
<p>Basic speech, motor ability, or even life were supposed to be nonexistent in Marley. Her parents were told to put her on morphine and hospice, and that she would not live to see her first birthday. Marley has an extremely rare disease called <strong>Rhizomelic Chondrodysplasia Punctata (RCDP)</strong>, and will celebrate her third birthday in December.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>About RCDP</strong></h3>
<p>There are <em>fewer than 100</em> children in the world at this moment with RCDP. It is a treacherous genetic disorder that causes painful bone and joint deformities, mental retardation, pulmonary complications, and other (as of yet undiscovered) issues. How RCDP has affected Marley:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marley wears contacts daily because her lenses were surgically removed due to the cataracts she was born with.</li>
<li>At eleven months, she underwent major spinal surgery.</li>
<li>Marley spent her second birthday in the hospital due to hypoglycemia that has yet to be explained.</li>
<li>On July 11, she traveled to Baltimore to have hip reconstructive surgery on her right hip. She will return on August 22 for her left hip. </li>
</ul><p> </p>
<h2><strong>The biggest hurdle in beating RCDP is awareness.</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Research</strong></h3>
<p><strong>It amazes me that in 2012 we still know so little about RCDP.</strong> Every disease has what is called a <em>Natural History</em>, which studies how a disease has affected patients in the past and tells the natural course the disease will take. <em>RCDP has no natural history</em>. This means that doctors only have a slight idea of how RCDP will affect a child. Children with RCDP are essentially given a death sentence with no definitive reasoning. </p>
<p><strong>Why do doctors know so little about RCDP?</strong> Because they <strong><em>lack the funding</em></strong> to even compile patients' information!</p>
<p><strong>Researchers just discovered</strong> a medication that could potentially boost cognition and help RhizoKids on a molecular level. But to further research and get this approved by the FDA, they <strong><em>need funding</em></strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>It breaks my heart to even consider that children like Marley might die because there is not enough money to even research how her disease is affecting her.</strong></h3>
<p>My Marley has fought RCDP her entire life, and I will fight for her in any way I can.</p>
<h2><em><strong>PLEASE HELP ME FIND A MIRACLE FOR MARLEY!</strong></em></h2>
<h2> </h2>
<p>All funds raised will be donated directly:</p>
<p><strong>50% to RhizoKids International</strong>, A 501c nonprofit  organization started by families of children with RCDP to<em> <strong>help fund research</strong></em>. RhizoKids is the primary contributor to the RCDP team of doctors. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<div>Maternal Earth is dedicated to strengthening health access and education to women across their lifespan and the globe. Maternal Earth works with communities in developing countries to create sustainable solutions to gaps in maternal health care. While working in Uganda, Executive Director, Jess Restucci spent time on Kimi Island in Uganda. Here one midwive with the help of a part time nurse, takes care of all the medical needs of the women on the island, and many of the mens. She does this with very limited resources; limited access to clean water, medical supplies, and a lack of a clean and safe place for women to deliver. She currently is working out of her two room hut. </div>
<div> </div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Your contribution will go towards the contruction of the actual clinic, including buying the land. The clinic will consist of four rooms: reception, delivery, examination, and recovery. We will also be stocking the clinic with delivery beds, clean sheets, adaquate medical supplies and sanitation supplies along with materials for medical records. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In Rural Uganda only 32% of births are attended by a trained medical professional. The Sesse Islands where Kimi is located, are a group of 84 islands located in Lake Victoria. Services such as ante- and postnatal care and family planning are provided by 11 health centers spread across the islands. Travel to the main land is expensive, and limited, only one boat leaves the island for the mainland a day, making it difficult for women to recieve medical care. Currently there is not a clean place for delivery, or access to clean/sanitized instruments. This greatly increases risk of complications and post natal infections.</p>
<p>Since one boat leaves the island a day, high risk pregnancies often get delivered on route to the mainland, resulting in injury or death </p>
<p>The Clnic will: </p>
<div>•Serve the population of Kimi Island and surrounding islands. Kimi Island has 5,000 residents.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>•Provide prenatal, post natal, and health women care, as well as trainings for the community</div>

<p>Wahya Warriors is currently working through USDA Rural Development to place a not for profit Veterans Specialized Assisted Living and Memory Care campuses throughout Texas. The purpose of the campus is to aid the aging and disabled veteran to retain independence at the highest level possible. Currently in America we are facing a crisis with the Baby Boomers approaching. With only a very few licensed facilities that will accept VA, Tricare, medicaid and medicare benefits. The goal for the community is to aid and assist veterans with the highest care available. Instead of relying on home based visits and being placed on a waiting list for one of the few beds to open up. Not only will it serve veterans and their family, the veterans can continue to serve the community by interacting with other veterans who are members of VFW, American Legion, etc. Once the facility is operational, the facility will be turned over to a board of Veterans to run and manage. Veterans taking care of veterans.</p>
<p><strong>Assisted Living:</strong></p>
<p>Veterans are increasingly using their benefits to pay for assisted living, but the number of beneficiaries could be higher, experts say. There are nearly 13 million wartime veterans in the United States who could qualify for nearly $2,000 monthly toward assisted living … <br/>According to VA estimates, 2.3 million veterans who served in World War II are living in the United States, in addition to 2.6 million who served in Korea and 7.7 million in Vietnam. To qualify, members must have served a minimum of only 90 days and must meet other medical and financial qualifications. As reported in The Wall Street Journal, about 105,000 veterans as well as a large number of widows were using their benefits as of last year. ""This can be really important not only for older Americans, but also for their children if they're trying to deal with parents and how they're going to pay"" for assisted living and other long-term-care services, says Tom Pamperin, an associate deputy undersecretary in the VA's Veterans Benefits Administration.<br/>The benefit is underused, he says, because ""it doesn't occur to veterans in their 70s who may have had no encounter with the VA other than qualifying for a home loan 40 years ago that there are benefits payable to them.""</p>
<p><br/><strong>Memory Care:</strong></p>
<p>Study results reported this month in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society suggest that Veterans with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have a higher risk for dementia than their peers without PTSD. The authors emphasize that while PTSD was associated with higher risk, the greater majority of Veterans with PTSD in the study did not develop dementia. Older veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder were almost twice as likely to develop dementia as veterans without PTSD in a study of more than 180,000 veterans led by researchers at the San Francisco VA Medical Center and the University of California, San Francisco. The veterans were then followed from 2001 to 2007 and assessed for development of dementia according to standard medical diagnosis codes. By 2007, veterans with PTSD had a dementia rate of 10.6 percent, while veterans without PTSD had a dementia rate of 6.6 percent.</p>
<p>Fundraising Pre Development Costs:</p>
<p>The communities Board will need to fundraise with local TV and newspapers, VFW, American Legion as well as other sources. The amount we are looking to fundraise will be approximately $100,000. That is to pay for Developers expenses, USDA application fee’s,  architect, builder, financier, land option money, and feasibility studies.</p>

I have helped hundreds of people lose thousands of pounds, completely get off diabetes, high blood pressure and cholesterol medications while rediscovering a quality of life they thought they would never see. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Project Break Free is the next step in my mission to get America moving again, to reversing this obesity epidemic that is plaguing our nation, straining our financial system and killing our future. 2/3 of our population are overweight or obese and it costs our society $17 for every pound we are overweight. Obesity has been cited as a contributing factor to approximately 100,000-400,000 deaths in the United States ever year and was responsible for an estimated $147 billion in related healthcare costs in 2008 alone. Obesity-related medical problems are on the rise, diabetes is now the seventh leading cause of death in America and 1 out of 3 children born after the year 2000 will develop diabetes and are predicted to be the first generation to die before their parents. </strong></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>We have set an initial goal of raising $36,000 to help save 6 severely obese individuals. <strong>To do this we will remove these individuals from the current environment that reinforces all their negative behaviors and we will provide them with a safe, supportive, structured environment where we</strong><strong> can use our multi-disciplinary approach to create the ultimate health and fitness transformations. </strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>We focus on three critical areas: behavior and lifestyle modification, clean, organic nutrition, and physical activity built on a foundation of movement quality. This one year program includes an initial 6 week stay at our in-home training center outside Denver, Colorado where each guest will be given a custom nutrition management program designed by registered dieticians, provided with clean, organic food free of pesticides and GMOs, as well as a cutting edge physical training program, and daily coaching sessions that involve goal setting, activity and nutritional education and mental performance training to dissolve any emotional and mental barriers that may arise. </strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>Each amazing transformation will be filmed as part of an inspiring documentary to help us spread our message, support our cause and inspire others to take action. The money we raise will give us the ability to provide transportation, food, nutritional supplements, housing, expert training, coaching, and ongoing support for the 6 individuals that most desperately need our help.</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>We have lined up some amazing perks for all of you that join our movement and support our cause and will be adding more perks as our campaign progresses. </strong></p>

<h3>Who is Valarie and why should you care?</h3>
<p>Valerie DeFrance's work as an EMS professional includes her position as a founding member of the Hope-Sunrise EMS service--an all-volunteer, nonprofit group, which according to Valerie has never had more than a dozen responders to cover a community of 250 residents and 20 miles of a busy major highway. She entered EMS in 1984 after her brother died in a car crash two miles from home and the closest emergency care was 60 minutes away.</p>
<p>""In those days a trooper was usually first sent to an accident to see if an ambulance was needed, so there were a lot of delays,"" she says. ""I decided that was nonsense; we needed somebody local to respond.""</p>
<p>Fortunately, that was a time when the region was looking to expand EMS, and Valerie stepped up--first as a student, then as an instructor. She progressed through the levels of EMT certification to paramedic course coordinator and served as president of the Kenai Peninsula EMS Council for seven years, in addition to being a member of numerous state and local committees and boards.</p>
<p>In 2007, after a 30 year career of helping people and teaching others how to be good EMT's and paramedics, Valerie was recognized as the best of the best and awarded the 22nd Annual Braun Industries/ZOLL Medical EMT/Paramedic of the Year.</p>
<p>Since 1999, Valerie has operated a website called the EMS House of DeFrance (<a href=""http://www.defrance.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.defrance.org</a>), and has operated the Emergency Medical Services Educational Resources website since 2000 (<a href=""http://defrance.org/inst"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://defrance.org/inst</a>), which is a free online repository of instructional materials and multimedia presentations. She is also publisher of EMSNetwork News (<a href=""http://www.emsnetwork.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.emsnetwork.org</a>), a free online site; webmistress for <a href=""http://www.emsspeakers.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.emsspeakers.org</a> and for the new National EMS Museum Foundation. She is a prolific writer and operates numerous other specialty EMS websites.</p>
<p>In addition to the websites, Valerie created a Pediatric Seat Belt Safety Program and a comic book series for children that teaches injury prevention and how to call 9-1-1. She helped develop software to help EMS services track, extrapolate and archive patient databases and statistics. She has twice been recipient of Alaska's ""First Lady Award for Volunteerism,"" from the governor's wife.</p>
<p>Recently, when a local EMS training program declared bankruptcy, Valerie volunteered her time and personal funds for six months to enable the 11 paramedic students to complete their training. This came at a time when her husband (who later died) was ill and funds were scarce.</p>
<p>All of these accomplishments barely scratch the surface of Valerie's contribution to EMS, but you wouldn't hear it from her. This unassuming lady still thinks she's just ""a small cog in the EMS wheel,"" as one of her supporters put it. What drives her to continue? ""Knowing you can make a difference in the quality of people's lives,"" she says. ""Anything you can do to send them home from the hospital in as close to the shape they were in before an illness or injury occurred is the name of the game for me.""</p>

<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Valerie's husband died of cancer only a few years back. Even with insurance the bills were almost insurmountable; forcing Valerie to sell off most of her assets and her home. </p>
<p>And now Valerie has cancer and there is nothing left to sell. </p>
<p>Valerie has given so much to her home community and to the pre-hospital medical professions, and has done so selflessly. Valerie has been a giver, never a taker, and now we need to return the favor. </p>
<p>All funds collected here will go to fund ongoing cancer treatment. The cancer was caught at a stage where the hopes for survival are good. A tumor was surgically removed and now she is in radiation therapy. We can make a difference.</p>

  The Impact


Many families in our
valley like so many other communities have been hit hard by the recession and can’t
afford even half of the tuition needed for camp. Completing a successful
campaign will ensure that more children will be able to pack their duffel bags
and head immediately to camp. Others whose camps have already occurred will be
assured of a spot for next year. Research has shown that a week of summer camp
has a greater long term impact on a child’s faith development and social and
emotional growth than an entire academic school year. Many Christians can trace
the roots of their relationships with Christ back to a campfire long ago
amongst loving and committed camp staff. A lost opportunity for even one child
is a loss we can’t afford.
 



What We Need & What You Get
We need to raise $40,000 before summer's end for scholarships for
campers in need of support as well as ongoing operating costs of camp such as
food, supplies, and counselor salaries.
Cost of camp for one camper:



½ a day of camp = $50


4 days of camp = $400




1 day of camp = $100

<p>Make your smartphones smarter!</p>
<p>Mobixpay (mo - bex - pay) is more than a mobile shopping App.  It's a movement!  And the goal of this Indiegogo campaign is to fund a redesign of the App that adds functionality so you can have that many more ways to sell, shop and save when using your smartphone.</p>
<p>The Indiegogo funding will be used to complete product enhancements that will make the mobiXpay platform more functional and easier to use while providing you with fast access to what we hope will become the largest collection of location-based deals available via smartphone today.</p>
<p>Specifically, the biggest changes to mobiXpay will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Helping every mobiXpay user become a potential seller of goods, services and experiences solely through the use of their smartphone.  (A faster, 100% mobile and location-based alternative to websites like eBay and Craigslist).</li>
<li>Providing quick searchable access to 1000s of local daily deals.  (No need to search for or flip through the scores of daily deal websites and email).</li>
<li>Delivering a faster and easier registration and publishing website for local merchants.  (It will be even easier for your favorite stores to reward you for your loyalty with customized and timely deals).</li>
</ul><p>These enhancements will go a long way towards establishing mobiXpay as the global go-to mobile shopping App that transforms the way we all sell, shop and save.</p>
<p>Remember, the more funding we receive the faster we can develop and deliver our product enhancements.  And, honestly, we're hoping to kick the crap out of our target.  So, please, do fund us today.</p>

<h2><strong>(I restarted our previous campaign and made this new page)<br/></strong></h2>
<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<p>Richard (Ricky) my husband was born with Hip Displaysia and Blount's Diease. He had a surgery as a baby for the Hip Displaysia and several more throughout his youth. Ultimately he knew that one day he would need a total hip replacement.</p>
<p>He's now 33 years old and married with 4 beautiful children (10, 5, 4, and 2). He is an awesome father and our kids love him so much. It saddens them each day to see Daddy in so much pain. The time has come for the surgery that he knew he would need. He needs a total hip and femur replacement right away. His hip is collapsed and his femur is severly deformed. </p>
<p>Ricky was intially denied hip replacement 5 years ago due to obesity which would make it a high risk. A couple years later we were blessed with him being able to get bariactric surgery (gastric bypass) pro bono. He lost 100 pounds over time and was no longer obese. He has gained some weight now due to his limited mobility and its getting harder for him each day. He is in constant severe pain and sleeping at night is difficult. </p>
<p>I work full time and he stays home with the kids. Lately though I have had to call in to work and stay home to help care for the kids and him. This is putting strain on my job and our finances. </p>
<p>If he doesn't get the surgery as soon as possible then I will be forced to stop working and he will continue to get worse. Currently he is walking 100% of the time with a cane and he is homebound 90% of the time. </p>
<p>I can take a leave of absence from work but it would not be a paid leave. We do not have any savings to afford me out of work while he recovers. Our insurance covers the cost of the surgery. His recovery should be around 6-8 weeks.</p>
<p>I have exhausted every resource and tried my best to make this happen on our own and we have run out of time. We can't save due to the lack of finances as it is for our current needs because of me missing work so much to help him and the kids. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2><strong>Our Need</strong></h2>
<p>We need to be able to survive while I am home caring for Ricky post surgery and the kids. The doctor believes that it will be 6-8 weeks(typical hip replacement recovery time) it could vary depending on his deformity and how it heals. </p>
<p>We need at least $8000 in order to cover our exspenses for 1-3 months. This will cover our rent, utilities, food, diapers and gas money for travel to and from the doctor, hospital and rehab (post surgery). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>By helping you will enable Ricky to have a normal pain free life. He will be able to walk without struggle. He will also be able to go back to work and pursue school to continue his education.</p>
<p>If you are unable to contribute we welcome prayer and if you can use the Indiegogo Share tools to help more people see our information we would be so very grateful.</p>

It can be an obsession, an addiction, a hobby, or it can even be a punishment.</p>
<p>For me running is a passion.</p>
<p>I am constantly challenging myself and pushing my limits as a runner. I have ran every race distance from 5K to 50 Miler. My next test is the <a href=""http://www.rundisney.com/disneyworld-marathon/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2013 Goofy Challenge during the Walt Disney World Marathon Weekend</a>.</p>
<p><img alt=""Running Strong to the Finish"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v238/diceshooter/goofy%20challenge%20indiegogo/62392_1486772811374_1163053_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 5px;""/></p>
<p>The Goofy Challenge is a total of 39.3 miles. It consists of the WDW Half Marathon on Saturday followed by the WDW Marathon on Sunday.</p>
<p>The cost of running can be expensive, but the returns running gives you are priceless. Since the Goofy Challenge is a destination race I am looking for sponsors to help cover the cost of running this event. The main expenses are race entry fee, airfare, accomodations, and food for me and my girlfriend, Jamie, who is also running the Goofy Challenge.</p>
<p>I have been blessed with the ability to run, the good health to push myself, and blessed with friends online and offline that support the running community and inspire and motivate me everyday. If I can continue to be blessed with sponsors I wil be forever grateful and I will pay my blessings forward.</p>
<p>I am donating 20% of all sponsorship money to the <a href=""http://www.woundedwarriorproject.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wounded Warrior Project</a>. If I can significantly exceed my initial goal of $2000 I will increase the percentage donated based on the total sponsorship I receive.</p>
<h3>Why Should You Sponsor Me?</h3>
<p>So why, you may be asking yourself, should I sponsor a mid pack runner on his quest to become a Goofy Challenger?</p>
<p>Here are three reasons in reverse order of importance:</p>
<ol>
<li>You are helping a fellow endurance athlete continually test his limits and push his body. You are contributing to my improvement physically, mentally, and spiritually.</li>
<li>You receive rewards! The various sponsorship levels offer rewards as a thank you for your contribution. The $39 level sponsorship will get you all of the personal rewards as well as allow you to honor a military man or woman you love.</li>
<li>Sponsorships also benefit the Wounded Warrior Project. There will be at least 20% of all sponsorships going to the organization.</li>
</ol><h3>The Race Shirt</h3>
<p>I am designing a t-shirt that will be a key factor in this campaign. I will have 3 or 4 of the same shirt to wear during race weekend. It will be seen by <strong><em>tens of thousands of people</em></strong> at the race expo, during the half marathon, during the full marathon, and around various locations on the Disney properties.</p>
<p>On the back of the shirt there will be enough space reserved for the names of up to 100 military personel that I will be honoring on behalf of personal sponsors. The list will include Name, Rank, and Branch of service for each person. </p>
<p>On the back of the shirt, along the bottom, will be space for the ""Ultramarathon"" level sponsors, and the front of the t-shirt will be given to the title sponsor level.</p>
<h3>Corporate Sponsors</h3>
<p>There are two sponsorship levels set up for corporate sponsors. These levels are open to any business, brand, website, company, or person. Please remember this is a runDisney event so any corporate sponsor should be family friendly. Runner friendly is good too, but not a requirement.</p>
<p>The first level is limited to 4 spots. This level will buy you a logo spot on the back of the race shirt. Your logo must be a black and white image with 300 DPI in JPG or PNG format. The image can be any shape or brand look, but must fit within a 3 inch wide by 2 inch border. I will also review your product on my blog.</p>
<p>The title sponsor is limited to 1 spot. Your logo appears on the front of the shirt. Your logo can be up to four colors. It must be a JPG or PNG format with 300 DPI. The image can be any shape or brand look, but must fit within a 14 inch by 14 inch border. Along with that I will also use any samples you wish to provide to me and I will post reviews and promotion on my blog, YouTube and social networking sites. If your product is race appropriate I will use it through the entire marathon weekend in public and provide exposure for your product in real world settings.</p>
<p>Images need to be emailed to me no later than 5 days after this campaign ends. Any questions regarding sponsorships can be posted as a comment on this campaign.</p>
<h2>More About Me</h2>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v238/diceshooter/goofy%20challenge%20indiegogo/prerace.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 5px;""/>I have been running since 2008. First it was a challenge to get off the couch, but with each step the challenges grew tougher. First it was finishing a mile without stopping. Then it was finishing a 5K and then a 10K. Ten miles, half marathon, marathon and ultra marathon. I am always looking at the next level in my running and trying to improve myself and run strong.</p>
<p>I am a widowed father of two sons. Tyler is 9 and Christopher is 5. I am not a perfect father, but I try my best to show my sons they can do so much more than they think they can. And I use running to show them.</p>

<p>I love encouraging people to run and become active. Everyone can push past the limits they place on themselves and achieve things that seem impossible to them. This motivates me.</p></div>","Running is different things to different people. It can be an obsession, an addiction, a hobby, or it can even be a punishment.
For me running is a passion.
I am constantly challenging myself and pushing my limits as a runner. I have ran every race distance from 5K to 50 Miler. My next test is the 2013 Goofy Challenge during the Walt Disney World Marathon Weekend.

The Goofy Challenge is a total of 39.3 miles. It consists of the WDW Half Marathon on Saturday followed by the WDW Marathon on Sunday.
The cost of running can be expensive, but the returns running gives you are priceless. Since the Goofy Challenge is a destination race I am looking for sponsors to help cover the cost of running this event. The main expenses are race entry fee, airfare, accomodations, and food for me and my girlfriend, Jamie, who is also running the Goofy Challenge.
I have been blessed with the ability to run, the good health to push myself, and blessed with friends online and offline that support the running community and inspire and motivate me everyday. If I can continue to be blessed with sponsors I wil be forever grateful and I will pay my blessings forward.
I am donating 20% of all sponsorship money to the Wounded Warrior Project. If I can significantly exceed my initial goal of $2000 I will increase the percentage donated based on the total sponsorship I receive.
Why Should You Sponsor Me?
So why, you may be asking yourself, should I sponsor a mid pack runner on his quest to become a Goofy Challenger?
Here are three reasons in reverse order of importance:

You are helping a fellow endurance athlete continually test his limits and push his body. You are contributing to my improvement physically, mentally, and spiritually.
You receive rewards! The various sponsorship levels offer rewards as a thank you for your contribution. The $39 level sponsorship will get you all of the personal rewards as well as allow you to honor a military man or woman you love.
Sponsorships also benefit the Wounded Warrior Project. There will be at least 20% of all sponsorships going to the organization.
The Race Shirt
I am designing a t-shirt that will be a key factor in this campaign. I will have 3 or 4 of the same shirt to wear during race weekend. It will be seen by tens of thousands of people at the race expo, during the half marathon, during the full marathon, and around various locations on the Disney properties.
On the back of the shirt there will be enough space reserved for the names of up to 100 military personel that I will be honoring on behalf of personal sponsors. The list will include Name, Rank, and Branch of service for each person. 
On the back of the shirt, along the bottom, will be space for the ""Ultramarathon"" level sponsors, and the front of the t-shirt will be given to the title sponsor level.
Corporate Sponsors
There are two sponsorship levels set up for corporate sponsors. These levels are open to any business, brand, website, company, or person. Please remember this is a runDisney event so any corporate sponsor should be family friendly. Runner friendly is good too, but not a requirement.
The first level is limited to 4 spots. This level will buy you a logo spot on the back of the race shirt. Your logo must be a black and white image with 300 DPI in JPG or PNG format. The image can be any shape or brand look, but must fit within a 3 inch wide by 2 inch border. I will also review your product on my blog.
The title sponsor is limited to 1 spot. Your logo appears on the front of the shirt. Your logo can be up to four colors. It must be a JPG or PNG format with 300 DPI. The image can be any shape or brand look, but must fit within a 14 inch by 14 inch border. Along with that I will also use any samples you wish to provide to me and I will post reviews and promotion on my blog, YouTube and social networking sites. If your product is race appropriate I will use it through the entire marathon weekend in public and provide exposure for your product in real world settings.
Images need to be emailed to me no later than 5 days after this campaign ends. Any questions regarding sponsorships can be posted as a comment on this campaign.
More About Me
I have been running since 2008. First it was a challenge to get off the couch, but with each step the challenges grew tougher. First it was finishing a mile without stopping. Then it was finishing a 5K and then a 10K. Ten miles, half marathon, marathon and ultra marathon. I am always looking at the next level in my running and trying to improve myself and run strong.
I am a widowed father of two sons. Tyler is 9 and Christopher is 5. I am not a perfect father, but I try my best to show my sons they can do so much more than they think they can. And I use running to show them.
I am also a writer. I blog about running at my website, www.billdowis.com and I am currently completing a running memoir to tell my story of running through loss, love and life.
I love encouraging people to run and become active. Everyone can push past the limits they place on themselves and achieve things that seem impossible to them. This motivates me.",3.0,0,"3 Campaigns

</h3><p></p>Hey, all!  My name is Kyle Lansden, and I'm a soon-to-be graduate of <a href=""http://www.gonzaga.edu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gonzaga University</a> in Spokane, WA.  I've been passionate about serving those who need it the most for many years in my life.  I've done mission trips to <a href=""http://www.mustardseed.com/site/PageServer?pagename=mustard_seed_index"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nicaragua</a> and the Blackfeet Indian Reservation in Browning, MT, as well as work with other service organizations in the past.  <br/><br/>I'm finally at the point in my life where I can do it for an extensive period of time and truly become invested in the community.  My <b>philosophy about service</b> is that I'm by no means going there to ""fix"" their problems.  I am simply using my skills in <i>collaboration</i> with the local people to help meet <i>their needs</i>.  <br/><br/><b>Education &amp; Skills:</b> I have a background in Spanish (B.A.) as well as health sciences (pre-requisites for nursing school) in addition to teaching many years of adaptive swim lessons and working with those who have disabilities.  This opportunity to work for and with those at Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos (NPH) is the perfect fit to put all of my skills to use.  <br/><br/><h3>About the Organization</h3><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAFul6RXCHI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NPH</a> is a wonderful organization (watch the video above, or click the link provided for additional info.).  With orphanages for abandoned children
 all over Latin America and the Caribbean, they try to provide resources
 to children who would otherwise have none.  They do not adopt the children out, and they are there as part of a permanent family to provide stability in their historically unstable lives.  Their idea is simple: provide rare opportunities so that the kids can one day become contributing members of society to raise their country out of poverty.  I firmly stand by the philosophy of NPH, and I can't wait to get started working for them!  <br/><br/>While the organization does so much in terms of providing quality education, housing, and food, in addition to other things that we often take for granted, they have asked me to perform a very specific task, which is rarely available to the disabled in developing nations: developing a water therapy program for their special education students and the local community!<br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FxAFul6RXCHI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DxAFul6RXCHI&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FxAFul6RXCHI%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><br/><h3>My Work<br/>
</h3>My time with NPH will be a time for me to provide a much needed service that the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CXH9B7qPeE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">orphanage</a> in San Pedro de Macorís, Dominican Republic has a great need for: providing therapy to their special education students.  A new special needs home has been constructed in the DR complete with a therapy pool.  <br/><br/><b>Main Objective:</b> Because of my background with adaptive swim lessons and working with people with disabilities, along with my interests in one day entering the health field, they have asked me to collaborate with their physical and occupational therapists to provide a form of therapy that both builds the muscular strength as well as the self-esteem of the kids that I work with.  Because the program is brand new, I have also been asked to lay the foundation, in conjunction with the current staff, for the program and teach skills to the permanent caretakers so that the program becomes sustainable.  <br/><br/><b>Additional Work:</b> In addition to my work as the pool therapist, I may be assigned to be the new health clinic assistant when the current volunteer leaves in June.  I will also be assigned to a house of boys, already managed by their permanent caregiver(s)), and be their mentor during my year in the DR.  I will eat lunch and dinner with them every day and plan weekend activities with them to further develop the NPH family.<br/><br/>I feel incredibly blessed to have been selected for this job, and I am honored to help in the formation of a rare program that will hopefully benefit the residents of the orphanage and the local community for years to come.<br/><br/><h3>Your Donation</h3><p><b>How the Money Will be Used:</b> Your donation will help me to finance my year-long service in the Dominican Republic.  As a soon-to-be college grad (graduation is on May 11th!!!), I have accrued approximately $30,000 in debt during my four years at Gonzaga.  However, I will only be given a small stipend (about US$100 a month) from the organization, which I will use to buy personal necessities, and I need some way to help pay the interest on my loans while I am away.  <br/></p><p><b>In the Perfect World...:</b> Ideally, I would raise enough money to be able to stay for two full years so that I can really become immersed in the community and make sure that I am able to help lay a solid foundation for their new pool therapy program, but that all depends on my ability to keep up with my student loans (gosh darn financial responsibility!!).  <br/></p><p>Your donation will make a life-long dream of making a real difference come true in addition to helping me discern where I am called in life with regards to my future career.  I will carry my experience in the Dominican Republic with me for the rest of my life in my calling to serve the least of our brothers and sisters.  <br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>My Goal<br/>
</h3><p>I hope to raise $1500 to help pay the interest on my loans while I am abroad.  The closer I come to this goal, which I hope to surpass, the longer I will be able to serve in the Dominican Republic to give this developing program the attention that it needs and deserves.  Any donation, large or small, helps this dream become a reality.<br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><ul>
<li>Supporting someone accomplish a task that is greater than his self</li>
<li>Enabling a rare program to develop and flourish<br/>
</li>
<li>Allowing those with physical and mental disabilities to grow stronger physically, mentally, and emotionally through my dedicated work<br/>
</li>
</ul><p></p><h3>Related Experience</h3><p><b>Water Experience:</b> I have been a lifeguard and taught regular and adaptive swim lessons at the <a href=""http://www.cityofventura.net/aquatics"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ventura Aquatic Center</a> in Ventura, CA for approximately 6 years.  In addition, I coached our youth LA84 Foundation water polo team.  I have experience as a swimmer and water polo player.  </p><p><b>Working with People with Disabilities:</b> My freshman and sophomore year at Gonzaga University, I was one of the coordinators for Gonzaga University Specialized Recreation (GUSR).  This is a program for adults with disabilities from the greater Spokane area to come and form relationships with members of the Gonzaga community.  We organized a play, which we performed at the end of every semester, as well as Special Olympics sports, which we competed in throughout various times of the year.  </p><p></p><h3></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/485027/files/20140404220408-DSC00213.JPG?1396674248"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><b>Community Outreach &amp; Project Design:</b> In Spokane, WA, I currently work for a non-profit health clinic and treatment and community outreach center called <a href=""http://nativeproject.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NATIVE Project/NATIVE Health of Spokane</a>.  I am their college intern, and my responsibilities have been to help with community outreach events.  We have Wellness programs every Wednesday night where I am in charge of the tutoring room, and this year I am on the board of our Youth Leadership Camp, which is designed to empower young, at-risk youth.</p><p>I hope to use these past skills and experiences to best serve the kids at NPH, share in struggles and triumphs, contribute to the betterment of an impoverished community, and form a relationship of mutual respect in which learning and the exchange of ideas goes in both directions.  <br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help:</p><ul>

Hey, all!  My name is Kyle Lansden, and I'm a soon-to-be graduate of Gonzaga University in Spokane, WA.  I've been passionate about serving those who need it the most for many years in my life.  I've done mission trips to Nicaragua and the Blackfeet Indian Reservation in Browning, MT, as well as work with other service organizations in the past.  I'm finally at the point in my life where I can do it for an extensive period of time and truly become invested in the community.  My philosophy about service is that I'm by no means going there to ""fix"" their problems.  I am simply using my skills in collaboration with the local people to help meet their needs.  Education & Skills: I have a background in Spanish (B.A.) as well as health sciences (pre-requisites for nursing school) in addition to teaching many years of adaptive swim lessons and working with those who have disabilities.  This opportunity to work for and with those at Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos (NPH) is the perfect fit to put all of my skills to use.  About the OrganizationNPH is a wonderful organization (watch the video above, or click the link provided for additional info.).  With orphanages for abandoned children
 all over Latin America and the Caribbean, they try to provide resources
 to children who would otherwise have none.  They do not adopt the children out, and they are there as part of a permanent family to provide stability in their historically unstable lives.  Their idea is simple: provide rare opportunities so that the kids can one day become contributing members of society to raise their country out of poverty.  I firmly stand by the philosophy of NPH, and I can't wait to get started working for them!  While the organization does so much in terms of providing quality education, housing, and food, in addition to other things that we often take for granted, they have asked me to perform a very specific task, which is rarely available to the disabled in developing nations: developing a water therapy program for their special education students and the local community!My Work
My time with NPH will be a time for me to provide a much needed service that the orphanage in San Pedro de Macorís, Dominican Republic has a great need for: providing therapy to their special education students.  A new special needs home has been constructed in the DR complete with a therapy pool.  Main Objective: Because of my background with adaptive swim lessons and working with people with disabilities, along with my interests in one day entering the health field, they have asked me to collaborate with their physical and occupational therapists to provide a form of therapy that both builds the muscular strength as well as the self-esteem of the kids that I work with.  Because the program is brand new, I have also been asked to lay the foundation, in conjunction with the current staff, for the program and teach skills to the permanent caretakers so that the program becomes sustainable.  Additional Work: In addition to my work as the pool therapist, I may be assigned to be the new health clinic assistant when the current volunteer leaves in June.  I will also be assigned to a house of boys, already managed by their permanent caregiver(s)), and be their mentor during my year in the DR.  I will eat lunch and dinner with them every day and plan weekend activities with them to further develop the NPH family.I feel incredibly blessed to have been selected for this job, and I am honored to help in the formation of a rare program that will hopefully benefit the residents of the orphanage and the local community for years to come.Your DonationHow the Money Will be Used: Your donation will help me to finance my year-long service in the Dominican Republic.  As a soon-to-be college grad (graduation is on May 11th!!!), I have accrued approximately $30,000 in debt during my four years at Gonzaga.  However, I will only be given a small stipend (about US$100 a month) from the organization, which I will use to buy personal necessities, and I need some way to help pay the interest on my loans while I am away.  In the Perfect World...: Ideally, I would raise enough money to be able to stay for two full years so that I can really become immersed in the community and make sure that I am able to help lay a solid foundation for their new pool therapy program, but that all depends on my ability to keep up with my student loans (gosh darn financial responsibility!!).  Your donation will make a life-long dream of making a real difference come true in addition to helping me discern where I am called in life with regards to my future career.  I will carry my experience in the Dominican Republic with me for the rest of my life in my calling to serve the least of our brothers and sisters.  My Goal
I hope to raise $1500 to help pay the interest on my loans while I am abroad.  The closer I come to this goal, which I hope to surpass, the longer I will be able to serve in the Dominican Republic to give this developing program the attention that it needs and deserves.  Any donation, large or small, helps this dream become a reality.The Impact
Supporting someone accomplish a task that is greater than his self
Enabling a rare program to develop and flourish

Allowing those with physical and mental disabilities to grow stronger physically, mentally, and emotionally through my dedicated work

Related ExperienceWater Experience: I have been a lifeguard and taught regular and adaptive swim lessons at the Ventura Aquatic Center in Ventura, CA for approximately 6 years.  In addition, I coached our youth LA84 Foundation water polo team.  I have experience as a swimmer and water polo player.  Working with People with Disabilities: My freshman and sophomore year at Gonzaga University, I was one of the coordinators for Gonzaga University Specialized Recreation (GUSR).  This is a program for adults with disabilities from the greater Spokane area to come and form relationships with members of the Gonzaga community.  We organized a play, which we performed at the end of every semester, as well as Special Olympics sports, which we competed in throughout various times of the year.  Community Outreach & Project Design: In Spokane, WA, I currently work for a non-profit health clinic and treatment and community outreach center called NATIVE Project/NATIVE Health of Spokane.  I am their college intern, and my responsibilities have been to help with community outreach events.  We have Wellness programs every Wednesday night where I am in charge of the tutoring room, and this year I am on the board of our Youth Leadership Camp, which is designed to empower young, at-risk youth.I hope to use these past skills and experiences to best serve the kids at NPH, share in struggles and triumphs, contribute to the betterment of an impoverished community, and form a relationship of mutual respect in which learning and the exchange of ideas goes in both directions.  Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help:

</p><p>Two years ago this December, our
oldest boy was diagnosed with high-risk leukemia at two years of age.  Since then, we have been supported in so many
ways by loved ones and strangers alike. 
So in an effort to give back &amp; to raise money for Childhood Cancer
Research we have organized a few different fundraisers, while always trying to
keep it creative and fun (like hosting a dodge ball event last year).</p>
<p>This year, in an effort to continue
that creative approach we have created a weight loss challenge that invites
everyone to participate with us. Over the course of the next two months I
(John) will attempt to lose 35 lbs.  Anyone who wants to participate can
do so in the following options: </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>You can make a single one-time
donation OR </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>You can pledge an amount for each lb
I drop </p>
<p>Here’s
where it gets fun …since Katherine thinks I cannot achieve this goal, we have
created a competition between the two of us. 
For every pound I make over my goal (i.e. for every pound I lose in
addition to the 35lb goal), Katherine must perform a challenge from a
collection of ‘dares’.  Vice versa, for
every pound I am under my goal amount, I must draw a dare and perform it. <br/></p><p>If you decide to pledge a certain amount per pound lost, all you need to do is make the pledge on my FB page (John Griese).... then you can donate the amount once the final weigh loss is known. <br/></p>
<p>For
every participant that donates or makes a pledge for any amount, you will have the
opportunity to add your own creative dare to the mix.  At the end of the two months we will put all
of the dares in a hat and will draw them out one at a time.  Also, for every 50 likes we get on FB, I (John) will draw and perform an additional dare.</p>
<p>Remember, in the end, this is all about the kids!! ...September is Childhood Cancer Awareness (as well as Blood Cancer Awareness)
Month.  We thank you all in advance for
your support and participation.  Now get
to work thinking of some creative dares!!</p><p>Thank you,</p><p>John and Katherine Griese </p><p><br/></p>
<p>**P.S. Dares
must be safe, clean and relatively reasonable – remember these will be posted
online so lets keep it classy San Diego!!</p>

This patented bladder system is what allows our bags to hold their shape.You can stand the bags on end or even sit on a bag filled with balls and it holds it shape. Our bags come in three sizes. We offer a 12 ball: We offer a 16 ball bag: and we offer a 20 ball ""coach’s bag"":
Our bags definitely turn heads when seen in public, from the eye popping, diamondback iridescent colors of our lightweight ripstop nylon body fabric to the shiny, soft and supple, yet strong nylon mesh. We use only the finest materials throughout our bags, like world renowned “YKK” coil zippers. Our bags are well made, elegant, eye catching and they offer ample exterior surface area for brand promotion and advertising.Functionality:What our ball bags have managed to do is take up to 20 of your particular sports balls and corral them into the smallest, most efficient space possible and lock them there until you are ready to unzip and release them.


With the stowable backpack straps in place the bag becomes a functional hands free backpack. With the backpack on your back and one bag in each hand, carried by our center handles, one individual can unload from a vehicle and transport up to 60 sports balls to an event, tournament or large practice session.
We have been designing, revising, improving and prototyping our volleyball bags for a couple of years now.Now that we have a finalized design and our patent is in place we are ready for our first ""production run"".
We invite you to donate to our project so we can make our dream of taking a new ""product idea"" from concept to fruition. 
Thank you for your support.

How Clean is the Restaurant you are about you Eat in?</b></p><p><b><br/>The Last Major Innovations with Inspection Data happened around Y2K! </b></p><p>Think about the computer you were using in 1999. Now try adding 150,000,000 inspection reports, with hundreds of unique data fields on each report; spread across 3,100 Jurisdictions each using their own format. All while standardizing this data using only CSV Files, PDF’s, Access, or MySQL Databases. This is still the current technology used by almost every government agency or private company working with inspection data. <br/><b><br/>The Access, Aggregation, Processing, and Visualization of the Inspection Data is Everything. </b></p><p>HDScores has access to 3100 jurisdictions health departments’ inspection data, while we have not currently aggregated everything. We have the ability to handle and aggregate both digital and paper formatted data at reasonable costs. We know where the data resides, and how often the inspection data is updated. HDScores can bring this data to consumers in real-time.<br/><br/>HDScores uses a modern technology architecture, which enables concern consumer’s complex searches while still getting results back fast and in an easy to read, search, and understand format. While we have a complex back-end, for consumers our front end is simple, if you can click on a pin on a map then you already know how to use app.<br/><br/>No other inspection querying system allows our level of search granularity, and the existing, less-precise queries are generally quite slow, stemming from others' inappropriate technology and architecture for solving this problem. With existing competition not thinking large enough: from the beginning, our system has been designed and built to accommodate, process, and distribute hundreds of millions of records.</p><p><b>HDScores wants to SHARE THIS DATA!</b><br/>Our goal is to create a secure, trusted, and transparent, platform for concerned consumers to view health department inspection data on scale, without having to become a trained Chef, Data Scientist or Health Inspector. We do not require the health department to do anything different, we only worked with the finished publicly available data unlike other inspection systems.</p><p><b>How does Food Borne Illness affect Consumers?</b></p><p><b>47%</b> of every food dollar spent is in a dining establishment.<br/><b>56%</b> of all sporadic Food Borne Illnesses occur in Restaurants, Schools and Hospitals.<br/>The Food Industry in the United States is <b>4%</b> of GDP, and employees <b>10%</b> of the entire workforce. <br/>The annual economic cost to the US Economy caused by Food borne Illness is <b>$77,700,000,000</b>.

</p><p><b>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) </b></p><p><b><span><br/>
How does the HDScores Work?</span></b><br/>
HDScores aggregates health department inspections across the United States,
Canada, and United Kingdom into an easy to read, search, and understand format.
Each jurisdiction has their own policies, procedures and laws for inspection
data. HDScores understands and respects these standards. While aggregating,
processing, storing and visualizing data for easy consumer consumption. <br/><br/><b>What is the HDScores App Function?</b><br/>To answer a simple question for concerned consumers, HDScores can tell
consumers <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">“How clean is the restaurant you’re about to eat in?” </span><br/><br/><b>
What Jurisdiction does HDScores have in the application?</b><br/>Unlike other food safety and review sites, HDScores will not sticking to
only Major Metropolitan Cities or Jurisdictions that have already solved this
problem. HDScores will be launching our app in the following Jurisdictions listed above.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;""><span>What if you
can’t contribute? Are there other ways you can help?<br/></span></b>Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help.<br/>
We are asking our supporters to get the word out and make some noise about our IndieGoGo
campaign.<br/><br/><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">What is the money being used for?</b><br/>
To cover the cost of the rewards, app development, design and server costs,
plain and simple that is it. <br/><br/><b>What Technology Does HDScores Use?</b><br/>HDScores use a number of modern developed computer languages, frameworks, and hardware such as solid state hard drives and CDN's. We do development in-house for all of our applications, data aggregation, processing, and distribution.   <br/><br/><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">What is the Revenue Model?</b><br/>
HDScores has opted for a real time bidding display ad model in our consumer apps. All the data will be free for all
jurisdictions, once aggregated. We will be using Search, User and Demographic
Data, to increase the value of Targeted Real-Time Bidding Ads and User Profiles.
<br/><br/><b>Why so many charge for their Restaurant Inspection Apps?<br/></b>The Average Paid Restaurant Inspection Application Gets 4,000 Downloads and must split that revenue with the application platforms. Only Generating Revenue a one time from their applications. HDScores makes more money as more people use our applications. <br/><br/><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Why is the HDScores App Free? </b><br/>We will never charge consumers for free publicly available
government data.<br/><br/><b>What benefits does HDScores bring to
Consumers?</b><br/>When concerned consumers have access to accurate, easy to read, search and
understand format, they trust that data more. In jurisdictions that inspection
data is widely distributed food borne illness outbreak drop, and restaurants
get cleaner. <br/><br/><b>
What benefits does HDScores bring to Business?</b><br/>According to historical trends, when data is made transparent, sanitation
scores and sales increase. <br/>
We also have a separate B2B offering. <b style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/><br/>
What benefit does HDScores bring to Government?</b><br/>
HDScores has figured out the complicated standardization, normalization and
visualization problems of working with inspection data on scale.<br/>We also have a separate Government offering.   <br/><br/><b>

We understand this. HDScores has developed many innovative solutions to combat these challenges.What does a Health Department Inspection Report Look Like? Inspection reports vary in every jurisdiction, but here is just one example from Washington, DC. Unless you have the time, and expertise to find and understand this form you will not gain any value from the existing government interface. Washington DC Health Inspection ReportThe Same Data an Early Prototype of our SystemWe have a system that Geo-Locates each piece of data, creates an (HDScore) our Proprietary Scoring Algorithm and puts Regulations and Violations into an Easy to Read and Search Format regardless municipal borders. A simple search can include a search area, type of establishments, cuisine, and type of violations. Our App can tell you… “How clean is the restaurant you’re about to eat in?”  HDScores will be the World's Largest Health Department Inspection Database, The only source needed to look up inspection data, no need to go to multiple government websites to find this important information anymore. What does is the example of a closed Restaurant for Sanitation Violations? This establishment is an extreme example and has been closed three times for critical violations; the owners have been fined, and banned from owning a restaurant ever again in that jurisdiction.Mold Build up in the Refrigerator (Above 41 Degree Fahrenheit)General Filth, Black Mold on the WallsBlack Mold Office SignDead Mouse, Mouse DroppingsMold in the Ice MachineKnow Before You GO!!! How Clean is the Restaurant you are about you Eat in?The Last Major Innovations with Inspection Data happened around Y2K! Think about the computer you were using in 1999. Now try adding 150,000,000 inspection reports, with hundreds of unique data fields on each report; spread across 3,100 Jurisdictions each using their own format. All while standardizing this data using only CSV Files, PDF’s, Access, or MySQL Databases. This is still the current technology used by almost every government agency or private company working with inspection data. The Access, Aggregation, Processing, and Visualization of the Inspection Data is Everything. HDScores has access to 3100 jurisdictions health departments’ inspection data, while we have not currently aggregated everything. We have the ability to handle and aggregate both digital and paper formatted data at reasonable costs. We know where the data resides, and how often the inspection data is updated. HDScores can bring this data to consumers in real-time.HDScores uses a modern technology architecture, which enables concern consumer’s complex searches while still getting results back fast and in an easy to read, search, and understand format. While we have a complex back-end, for consumers our front end is simple, if you can click on a pin on a map then you already know how to use app.No other inspection querying system allows our level of search granularity, and the existing, less-precise queries are generally quite slow, stemming from others' inappropriate technology and architecture for solving this problem. With existing competition not thinking large enough: from the beginning, our system has been designed and built to accommodate, process, and distribute hundreds of millions of records.HDScores wants to SHARE THIS DATA!Our goal is to create a secure, trusted, and transparent, platform for concerned consumers to view health department inspection data on scale, without having to become a trained Chef, Data Scientist or Health Inspector. We do not require the health department to do anything different, we only worked with the finished publicly available data unlike other inspection systems.How does Food Borne Illness affect Consumers?47% of every food dollar spent is in a dining establishment.56% of all sporadic Food Borne Illnesses occur in Restaurants, Schools and Hospitals.The Food Industry in the United States is 4% of GDP, and employees 10% of the entire workforce. The annual economic cost to the US Economy caused by Food borne Illness is $77,700,000,000. From lost productivity, medical expenses, waste, and premature deaths due to foodborne illnesses.48,000,000 People have a Food Borne Illness annually(16% of the US Population or 1 in 6 Americans)30,000,000 People at High Risk Susceptibility to Food Borne Illness Annually 13,000,000 Chronic Secondary Complications resulting from Food Borne Illness annually3,800,000 Doctor Visits related to Food Borne Illness annually128,000 Hospitalizations related to Food Borne Illness annually  3,000 Deaths related to Food Borne Illness annuallyThe average food Borne illness related death costing $7,000,000.For every foodborne illness case that is reported, as many as 40 more illnesses are not reported or lab-confirmed.More than 30 million people in the United States are likely to be particularly susceptible to foodborne disease. Very young, elderly, and immune-compromised persons experience the most serious foodborne illnesses.Chronic, secondary complications resulting from foodborne illness occur in 2-3 percent of all cases.How common are food safety violations?32% of Food Service Professionals believe that food safety violations could cost them their professional and/or restaurant’s reputation.30% of consumers worry about getting a food borne illness and/or food poisoning.56% of all sporadic Food Borne Illnesses occur in Restaurants, Schools and Hospitals.In New York City in 2012, there were 273,999 fines for food safety violations.35% of Schools in Chicago have failed at least one health inspection since 2011.61 Restaurants were closed in Los Angeles in the last 3 months.How will this make restaurants cleaner?According to historical trends, when data is made transparent and publicly available. Sanitation scores and restaurant sales increase in cleaner establishments. In historical trends, both high and low income, urban and rural communities increase across the board when inspection data is made available and used.There will be 3 types of restaurant owners:Those who careThose who fix enough to stay openThose who do not care and repeat violations. If a consumers and health department uses data analytics like HDScores, you can better mitigate risks of food borne illness.. We see this causing less friction between Restaurant Owner’s and the Health Departments in the future.Who currently reports restaurant inspection reports?Government Agencies & Health Departments release data not necessarily in a consumable format.Newspapers – Generally on put as many inspection reports as they have space. Saving Inspection reports until, they are ready to publish these reports. When data is available. Internet Companies - Various companies are distributing data, there are lots of local companies, very few work with multiple jurisdictions on scale.TV News/Media stations in the top 40 Media Markets do 3200+ dirty dining segments annually.6,500,000 people watch restaurant disaster shows on a weekly basis. (Food Safety issues are a common issue).Does HDScores have Competition?Yes, HDScores is not the first company to think of this idea; we have seen a number of companies fade in and out over the last two years. We are one of the few companies working on scale, using modern technology and have multiple relevant domain expertise (Food Service, Sanitation, Technology, Data Science, and Business). HDScores is also working to solve the data distribution issue in jurisdictions that does not currently have this problem solved.YELP – Launched the LIVES Standard in January 2013 to a lukewarm reception. Which links five linked CSV files together to share the data, Yelp does not use their powerful API for inspection data. Sharing health department inspection data currently in five cities (SFO, NYC, Louisville KY, Wake County NC, Part of Los Angeles CA) not the original planned cities (Boston, Chicago, and Philly) that were supposed to launch by the end of the first year. They have only gone into jurisdictions that already have this data and problem solved or found someone to convert the data to their format.Dinesafe – Currently in beta, they are largest inspection site to date, prior to HDScores launching with 270,000+ establishments, spread across seven US States and six Canadian Providences. With a less then friendly search and user interface.HDScores Data AccessHDScores has great digital data access, and the ability to handle paper only jurisdictions in a cost effective, timely manner.HDScores Data AccessIn the USHDScores has digital access to the data for 1718 Health Departments of the 2550 Health Departments/Agencies. (Some Jurisdictions share Health Departments) in the US.Currently HDScores has digital access to 67.37% of all the Health Departments in the US.Encompassing Health Departments with data for 77.62% percent of the total US Population. (239,651,212 people according to the 2010 Census Data)HDScores will expand data access to as many jurisdictions as possible, rolling out new jurisdictions in a timely manner.Expanding InternationallyHDScores already has a detailed understanding of the inspection data in Canada, and the United Kingdom. The economic impact of food borne illness in the UK was £1.5 Billion and $1.1 Billion in Canada. We have 100% data access in the UK, and 76% data access in Canada. While rules are slightly different in each country, we have already mapped out our path towards our expansion and have data access. We are aware of several other countries we can expand into next in Asia, the Middle East and Europe.HDScores FutureOver the last 2 years, HDScores has explored a number of Business Models with traction we will be able to develop some of those plans in the future. HDScores has plans for the creation of Free Public API Portal for access to historical inspection data for the public, non-profit, and academic use, and deployment of a Universal Sanitation FICO Score in the near future. HDScores is starting here, with our App and we need your help.What others say about HDScores?

<p>From seed to bottle, our mission is to source the highest quality, sustainably grown and ethically harvested ingredients. We blend formulas with organic skincare oils and butters derived from fruits, seeds, flowers and vegetables. Everything is hand-crafted in small batches without parabens, sulfates, silicones, synthetic fragrances, and the other toxic chemicals and additives seen across our modern beauty industry. We only use plants that our ancestors have used for thousands of years: pure, simple, and natural. Getting products that are raw, real, and incredible, and also knowing that with every purchase, you are helping the local farmers, their communities thrive, and protect the forests.</p>

<p>Our love for wildcrafting starts in the backyard. We forage plants like comfrey, yarrow, and plantain across the coasts of California. We directly source from artisanal farmers and local companies that share our values on sustainability and fair trade. Beyond that, we source Amazonian plants through direct farmer-cooperative relationships. This in turn helps Exousia Wild preserve the forest, all while supporting local farmers. </p>
<p>We're able to enrich communities and give back to our land through sustainable harvesting and regenerative agriculture, as we continue to cultivate relationships with local artisans and ingredient suppliers. </p>
<p>Our production takes place in an urban garden and makers space called O2 Artisans Aggregate in Oakland. With neighbors like Juniper Ridge, Den Sake and Salt Point Seaweed, we're working alongside creatives and networks who are all bringing wonderful environmentally progressive projects and ideas to market. This hive of conscious companies inspired us deeply, as we developed a kinship with fellow artisans and laid the groundwork for Exousia Wild.</p>
<p>And through collaborating with these companies, along with practicing the principles that define us, we are able to create the freshest and highest quality beauty products. Ones that transform your skin and the way you feel about it.</p>

From seed to bottle, our mission is to source the highest quality, sustainably grown and ethically harvested ingredients. We blend formulas with organic skincare oils and butters derived from fruits, seeds, flowers and vegetables. Everything is hand-crafted in small batches without parabens, sulfates, silicones, synthetic fragrances, and the other toxic chemicals and additives seen across our modern beauty industry. We only use plants that our ancestors have used for thousands of years: pure, simple, and natural. Getting products that are raw, real, and incredible, and also knowing that with every purchase, you are helping the local farmers, their communities thrive, and protect the forests.
 

 

 
Our love for wildcrafting starts in the backyard. We forage plants like comfrey, yarrow, and plantain across the coasts of California. We directly source from artisanal farmers and local companies that share our values on sustainability and fair trade. Beyond that, we source Amazonian plants through direct farmer-cooperative relationships. This in turn helps Exousia Wild preserve the forest, all while supporting local farmers. 
We're able to enrich communities and give back to our land through sustainable harvesting and regenerative agriculture, as we continue to cultivate relationships with local artisans and ingredient suppliers. 
Our production takes place in an urban garden and makers space called O2 Artisans Aggregate in Oakland. With neighbors like Juniper Ridge, Den Sake and Salt Point Seaweed, we're working alongside creatives and networks who are all bringing wonderful environmentally progressive projects and ideas to market. This hive of conscious companies inspired us deeply, as we developed a kinship with fellow artisans and laid the groundwork for Exousia Wild.
And through collaborating with these companies, along with practicing the principles that define us, we are able to create the freshest and highest quality beauty products. Ones that transform your skin and the way you feel about it.

<h2>GLUCOSCANNER</h2>
<h3>GlucoScanner will be the first small, portable optical Glucometer! It is real, it is working and it is a few months away to be produced.</h3>
<p><br/><strong>IT WORKS!</strong><br/><i>Research and Development Settings</i><br/>Below is a demonstration video where we show how our prototype works. In the video we compare our results with an over-the-counter (OTC) glucometer that requires users to prick their fingers and deliver a drop of blood on a test strip.</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/mUCLVfc6JEk?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>In our demonstration, the prototype outcome is 109mg/dL, if we consider 114 mg/dL as a glucose value close enough to the reference value. In this case our estimate would be in compliance with FDA guidelines. However, our ultimate aim is to create a device that gives results as close as possible to the actual values. We make similar tests in our laboratory daily, mostly on ourselves, and if there is an opportunity we test friends, colleagues and occasionally paid outside subjects.</p>
<p><i>""<strong>We have to reduce its size to make it smaller than a mobile phone.</strong> We have already contacted the people responsible for miniaturization: <strong>it will cost about 130-150 thousand dollars.</strong> This is why we use crowdfunding. Then, of course, the device will be tested on as many patients as possible,” </i>explains Stefano Valenzi. <i>“It will definitely change the life of diabetic persons”.</i></p>

<div>I am Stefano Valenzi, a researcher specialized in physiological data. I was formally trained in Italy. In 2008 I moved to Japan to work at Brain Science Institute of RIKEN. RIKEN is one of the top research institutes in the world. There I met Peter Jurica, a talented engineer. He moved from Slovakia for the same reasons, to work with the most advanced technological resources in a world class environment.</div>
<p>We became aware of problems related to glucose self-monitoring when our parents started to check themselves daily. We began to explore alternative non invasive methods for controlling and monitoring of blood glucose. </p>
<p>Our exploration started with long discussions and research review. Non-invasive methods for blood glucose monitoring were researched before. We knew this from the work on devices we had built until then. Among other methods, we found many scientific studies that were suggesting optical methods as one of the best ones to estimate blood glucose non-invasively. We reviewed the research and decided to try and replicate some of published studies. Meanwhile, we kept improving our skills in building hardware. Our first breadboard prototype for sensing glucose using different lights was an educated guess based on mixture of ideas from a few research papers we have deemed plausible.</p>
<p>Our first prototype used only optical sensors, it gave us the first positive signs of a working principle. A few more breadboards came after that, until they become so large and complex that we had to ask professionals to turn the mess of wires into a solid circuit board (picture below).</p>

<h3>Our Company</h3>
<p>We needed more money, more time, and more people. Help came in summer 2016, when the Dynamic Brain Lab was established. Our team grew by two new partners, Nicola Grieco and Roberto Forlani, with skills in business and marketing, and with definitely more financial means than us. We began the procedure for registering our first hardware patent on day one of the lab (<a href=""http://dynamicbrainlab.com/story.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">check our company story</a>). Other two <a href=""http://dynamicbrainlab.com/people.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">people</a> joined us since then, and many others are still helping us in our mission.</p>

<h3>Our mission</h3>
<p>Succeeding in our campaign means to create a painless and more affordable way of blood glucose monitoring. Lowering the expenses of to this procedure will mean that people, who could not until now afford the test strip method, could become able to monitor their blood glucose, and potentially live a healthier life. In future steps we are also looking into reaching criteria to get approvals for medical use and develop discreet wearable devices. Wearables will allow continuous monitoring and the possibility of automatic alarms and/or emergency calls.</p>

<p>We need to transform our device into a small, portable device, not just to make a more convenient and discreet device but also to improve its performance.</p>
<p>A successful funding campaign will allow us to facilitate data collection and generally improve the user experience. </p>
<p>Both points can be achieved by reducing the area occupied by sensors and creating a finger chamber with a self-adjusting spring system cuff. Users have to fully cover our device's optical sensors with their finger. The larger the sensors area the harder is to fully cover it, especially with tiny fingers. In our prototype we use off-the-shelf commercial sensors and LEDs which require 10 times more space than compact light/sensor sets designed for specific usage.</p>
<p>We amplify tiny signals millions of times so even imperceptible hand movements are creating noise. Having a spring system cuff will grant a constant pressure between users finger and sensors and will further reduce possible noise given by involuntary finger movements, so user can measure themselves with less movement restrains and generally in a more convenient way. Our current prototypes require the user to be still, resting arm close to the device, as in the time lapse below. The footage is from one day of our experiment.</p>
<div>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/oKTvE2Tecpg?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div><br/>This procedure will be easier with a cuff inserted into a finger clip as it is used currently in devices that employ similar optical technology. For instance pulse-oximeter uses a self-adjusting spring system to perfectly fit most fingers (picture below)</div>
<p>Last but not least, we will need your help to conduct the final stage of user experience checks and to completely test the new portable device in the wild, outside of the lab. We estimate to start such experiments in June 2018. Please go to <a href=""http://dynamicbrainlab.org/signup"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">dynamicbrainlab.org/signup</a> to leave your data.

<h3><strong>How We Will Use Money:</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>We can outsource some engineering work to professionals that can bring us to a stage of production within months. We have quotes from four potential partners. <strong>We need $130.000 for this stage.</strong>
</li>
<li>We can speed up the user experience testing and be sure to meet all quality standards in the shortest time possible. <strong>We need $50.000 for this stage.</strong>
</li>
<li>To start the mass production of GlucoScanner with a reasonable cost we have to anticipate some money to the manufacturer. <strong>We need $200.000 for this stage.</strong>
</li>
<li>More money could also speed up the process to get medical approvals. This would allow GlucoScanner to be recognized by medical insurances and welfare, and therefore GlucoScanner could become even more affordable.</li>

<h3>Open Question</h3>
<p>Currently our prototype works beyond our expectations, we have created a completely new method to acquire and evaluate data about blood flowing through examined tissue. Such innovative method has given our device the reliability that we could just hope for, and that no one could reach before. We are looking forward to test the miniaturized and stabilized portable device to evaluate how its performance will be improved. Right now, before to use our device to estimate blood glucose in new users, we have to calibrate the device. Based on differences we could observe so far, it was possible to group users with one of the 3 groups of parameters we defined. The question is whether or not GlucoScanner will be able to recognize automatically which group the users belong to. In the worst case scenario users will have to manually calibrate the device by a simple procedure.</p>

We can outsource some engineering work to professionals that can bring us to a stage of production within months. We have quotes from four potential partners. We need $130.000 for this stage.

We can speed up the user experience testing and be sure to meet all quality standards in the shortest time possible. We need $50.000 for this stage.

To start the mass production of GlucoScanner with a reasonable cost we have to anticipate some money to the manufacturer. We need $200.000 for this stage.

More money could also speed up the process to get medical approvals. This would allow GlucoScanner to be recognized by medical insurances and welfare, and therefore GlucoScanner could become even more affordable.



Open Question
Currently our prototype works beyond our expectations, we have created a completely new method to acquire and evaluate data about blood flowing through examined tissue. Such innovative method has given our device the reliability that we could just hope for, and that no one could reach before. We are looking forward to test the miniaturized and stabilized portable device to evaluate how its performance will be improved. Right now, before to use our device to estimate blood glucose in new users, we have to calibrate the device. Based on differences we could observe so far, it was possible to group users with one of the 3 groups of parameters we defined. The question is whether or not GlucoScanner will be able to recognize automatically which group the users belong to. In the worst case scenario users will have to manually calibrate the device by a simple procedure.


Help Us As You Can
We appreciate your help in any form. If you care, please be open to spread the news of our project, and of our campaign on social platforms. Please talk to friends or colleagues, or any other interested people who could benefit from this, any positive action would be of great help and deeply appreciated on our side. Blood glucose monitoring gives everyone the possibility of a healthier life.

Thank you!
