The many leading brands cables we tested had 19% slower data-read speeds than Python, and the slowest-charging cable conducted 41% less current than the Python cable.Buying after market USB cables will pretty much always result in getting cheap quality 30/30 cables and your device will barely break 500mAh when it charges, maybe even less. This isn't the only issue though. After you use a cable for a while it eventually stress near the plugs and causes poor connectivity between your device and the wire.Python cables Use 18AWG silver-plated copper cables for lower resistance and faster charging than any other cable out there and offer high speed charging at 3.1A, 3.2v - 20v & 18W and data sync up to 10Gbps, which would save you a lot of time to do other things...Yes you heard it right. 18AWG! And for data we have used a record breaker– 24AWG tightly braided wires so you can charge and sync at lightning speed. Less time plugged in, more time for going out! The random charging cable you have lying around might not be charging your electronics at full speed.We also designed the Python cable with single or dual functions to provide hassle free charging for all Lightning and MicroUSB devices.Python is Universal, it combines the two widely used connectors into one charging cable that’s easy to share with anyone whether they use an iPhone or an Android device, it’s the only charging cable you would ever need.MicroUSB cables provide charging power to basically every non-Apple digital device, and they’re used by everything from portable hard drives to smartphones to tablets to transfer data to and from your computer.Search the whole world and you will not find a single cable that can beat the Python cable and nothing would even look like it. It is our design inside and out from start to finish and with your help we can make Python a reality. The only thing that is missing from Python is shortcuts, gimmicks and cheap material. The rest is a workhorse that is certified, strong, fast, durable, reliable and lasting. Oh and beautiful!Gone are the days of carrying multiple charging cables for all of your different devices. With the Python cable you can charge everything, including your iPhone, iPad, Android phone, Tablets, Headphones, Speakers, Remotes, Cameras and more. Python streamlines your life by giving you one cable for all your devices!When we were creating the Python cable we thought about all the problems one faces when charging personal devices and there were many. One of the biggest struggles we have seen is when the standard 1-meter cable is either not long enough or too long!This is why we had to offer Python cable in several dynamic lengths as Size Matters. A 3-Meter Python is the world’s longest Apple MFi certified cable and all Python Cables are all QuickCharge 3.0 certified.The Bed Lean is Mean!10Ft/3M Super long lightning cable, long enough for using while you are lying in bed or lounging on your couch and charging at the same time. Get rid of limitation of length. Shorter cables, though generally less versatile, can certainly come in handy. They’re better at a desk when you don’t want a mess of extra cable length, they are great with power banks or for travel, when space and weight are important considerations.Python was born out of the necessity for a reliable and efficient charging solution, to de-clutter and to de-stress your life! The tough 3M braiding material keep the Python Cable inherently tangle-free. The 3, 2 & 1 meter cables also come with a complementary leather tie to keep things further organised.You’d probably struggle to find a case that the Python isn’t able to fit into, thanks to the ultra-slim aluminium finish that’s just barely wider than Apple’s own flimsy plastic connector. If your case uses a particularly small point of connection, then the Python is sure to offer the best fit.Python Cables have been designed with a plug housing that is small enough to work with every case we tested. No need to take off your lovely case for charging.The only thing that is missing from Python is shortcuts, gimmicks, cheap material and wishful promises. The rest is a workhorse that is certified, strong, fast, reliable and durable to last a lifetime.Every Python Cable is covered by a lifetime warranty. If your cable breaks from normal wear and tear, we’ll replace it.100% Satisfaction • 100% Performance for life, Guaranteed!Python is the world's most innovative charging cable using dual charging adaptors that fit into both Micro USB and Lightning devices. Python is also available in dual micro USB and USB Type C adapter or select a single adapter cable.Apple MFI: each cable contains a unique, verified serial number and an authorisation chip issued by Apple which communicates with any Lightning connector device to ensure 100% compatibilityOur USB-C cable meets or exceeds the following requirements: - 56kΩ Resistor - Vbus IR drop of less than 250mV - GND IR drop of less than 100mV.Material Kevlar braided PVC by 3M, the most powerful and strongest material in the world, 10X stronger than the ordinary cables, adds durability & reliability in a tangle-free versatile cable.All Python Cables are all QuickCharge 3.0 certifiedWhy we need your support Python is not just another cable - we are bringing a new and better standard of cables to the world. We have tremendous aspirations and many exciting projects brewing, but none of these will ever happen without your help.We are certain that the Python Cable is without a doubt the most powerful, fastest charging cable ever, the most versatile to use, and strongest most durable charging cable on the market. We have finalised the prototypes and now we need that last push to bring the product to you as quickly as we can.We would love for you to join our community and bring real charging cables into our daily lives. We can’t wait for you to try out Python.Risks and challengesWe’ve worked hard over the last few months to get the Python cable to this point and we've successfully completed critical milestones with the help of many knowledgeable people. We have interviewed, visited and selected a very reputable manufacturer who offers great engineering support and development tools. What remains is completing the manufacturing phase and so we're confident that manufacturing risk is at a minimum.We are almost ready to push the green button and start production with our manufacturer. We have done our testing and know this will be the best and last cable you will own and cannot wait to put it into your hands. We anticipate a manufacturing period of 6 weeks from the end of the campaign to start shipping Python to you. This is possible because we’ve already completed our R&D, obtained our Apple MFi certification, created the injection mould and the rest we can complete with your help and have the cables shipped to you 6 weeks after the end of this campaign and no later than September 15th, 2016.Thank you for reading this far - let's make this happen!",40.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>We are too, so we made this step-by-step guide anyone can use to start growth hacking immediately, using proven strategies we've used ourselves.</p>

<p>I’m an entrepreneur and one of the creators of the e-book and video course: “Secret Sauce: A step-by-step guide to growth hacking”, along with growth hacker and my co-author, Austen Allred.</p>
<p> The truth is that marketing is pretty easy once someone tells you what you should be doing. The only problem is that no-one wants do that.</p>
<p>There’s too much money in consulting and selling books about the veneer without ever giving up the actual secret sauce.</p>
<p>“This book and video course won’t be like that. In fact, they’ll be very different from that, and probably nothing like what you’re used to. Here’s why: Secret Sauce is not so much a book as it is a tutorial.</p>
<div data-id=""11041235""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1465417104/cr9kjixbzhfulquvhxud.png"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div>
<p>Secret Sauce is a step-by-step, systematic dismantling and dissection of every channel and practice that actually works, laid out one after another. It’s a guide that will handhold you all the way to getting traffic, users, and revenue.</p>
<p>Our goal with this book and course is that someone who knows absolutely nothing about marketing could sit down, follow the instructions, and make what they’re doing blow up. We’ve done this before - a lot.</p>
<p>Our combined efforts account for millions of monthly pageviews, millions of social followers, millions of emails, millions of dollars in revenue -- no matter how you slice it, this stuff just works. We’ve tried hundreds of growth hacks in order to give you only the methods we know will work.</p>
<p>Most everything you’ll read is something anyone can do with a little bit of effort, and which requires very little (or zero) marketing budget.</p>
<p>By the time you finish this book, you will not only have a dozen ideas about different strategies that can help your idea succeed, but you’ll know exactly what it takes to implement each one of them.</p>

<p>I was on welfare/benefits 3 years ago, and used growth hacking techniques to get millions of visitors to websites I created and raise hundreds of thousands of dollars in investment, and got into the Techstars accelerator. I then launched a growth hacking agency and have used these techniques to move hundreds of thousands of people to websites, and acquire tonnes of users and followers for startups.</p>

<p>A key change in my life happened a year ago. An accelerator had heard I was a “growth hacker” and asked me to give a talk to their current teams. I put together a slide deck of what I considered the basics, and gave a presentation. Halfway through my talk I realised half of the room was taking pages of notes, while the others stared at me in disbelief. The minute my talk finished, founders ran up to me asking for my slides and if I did consulting. I was surprised- I hadn’t seen many people in marketing give talks and presumed you were meant to give practical advice and show people how to do things, pieces of software you can use to automate things, etc. this was not the case. I gave more talks and it’s an incredible feeling how much people find my talks useful. That’s where the idea for this book came from. Give as many people practical, actionable advice and strategies as possible. My growth hacking talk was eventually voted best workshop of SXSW V2V 2015. Earlier this year I gave a 30-date speaking tour of America, and am so excited to get this knowledge out there in full for the first time.</p>

<p>This is the first time I’m pulling back the curtain and unveiling my secrets, along with my co-author Austen Allred, who has moved millions of visitors and dollars through growth hacking across every channel from SEO to Pinterest and everything inbetween.</p>
<p>What you’ll discover in Secret Sauce can be used for good or evil. It is very powerful stuff. Right now, only a few people know how to do these things. We’re blowing the whistle on the tactics other people are using, and handing you the tools to do them yourself, and find your secret sauce.</p>
<p>And with that substantial word of warning, we launch our Indiegogo. If this book gets funded, it will be available very soon after, or most likely, before, the Indiegogo ends. We’re not sure what the blowback is going to be as no-one has done a book like this before. If you’ve ever read a marketing book and found it didn’t contain enough specific strategies to try, the growth hacking playbook is for you. If you work in marketing and want to use new techniques to boost your companies brand and get promoted, this book is for you. And if you run your own company, you are going to adore this book.</p>

<p>As many have pointed out to me, I could keep this information to myself and make more money from clients- but I truly believe we’re all better off if we share the knowledge and grow our companies together. As such, everyone who donates anything will be invited into a private growth hacking group on Facebook, where we’ll create an ongoing community to help each other with our digital marketing and startup growth problems. I wish there had been a group like this when I was on welfare and starting out on my company three years ago, rather than having to learn it all by trial and error. There’ll be no links or spam in the group, just questions, answers, and discussions from and to the community around this area which has so little useful information. This will make sure that the learning will continue after the campaign ends.</p>

White shows where UV light is reflected, and black shows where it is absorbed or blocked. </p></div><div>

<p>The SmartUV is very easy to use. It simply requires you to download the app for your smartphone before plugging the device in by using the connector.</p>
<p>(SmartUV is compatible with the OTG supported smartphones.)</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Choose your color?</strong></h2>
<p>The SmartUV is available in two colors. This custom selection will be confirmed on your perk during the checkout process.</p>

<h2><strong>What does the SmartUV do?</strong></h2>
<p>The SmartUV lets you see into the UV light spectrum – which is completely invisible to the naked eye. By seeing into the UV spectrum, you are able to discover a whole new, previously unexplored world. The SmartUV has many uses that let you test product claims with accuracy and allow you to see yourself and your skin in a whole new light.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Are your UV protection products actually working?</strong></h2>
<p>With the SmartUV you can put spectacles, window tints, and UV skin products – such as sunblock and SPF skincare – to the test to see if they actually do what they claim.</p>
<p>In UV light, UV blocking materials show up black, so it's easy to spot when something is protecting you from harmful rays or not. One of the amazing things you will discover is that even when old and new paint has been matched perfectly and looks identical in visible light, they actually have different densities that is easily revealed with the SmartUV under UV light! That means you can spot where a car panel has been resprayed (indicating accident repairs on a second hand vehicle) or if a room has recently been painted – compared to the rest of the building.</p>

<p>Overexposure to the sun's UV light causes sunburn and 90% of skin cancers; damages the immune system and eyes, ages skin prematurely and fades color in fabrics and furnishings. </p>
<p>UV light is invisible and most of its harmful effects only show up over time, with sun damage lying beneath the skin, unknown for years. Most of us see our skin in the mirror and can't help but think, ""I don't really have too much to worry about"". But under UV light, your skin looks quite different.</p>
<p>Firstly, UV light penetrates the outer layer of your skin, showing you what it looks like below the surface. Secondly, pigmentation (melanin) build-up shows up as dark spots, so you can spot invisible sun damage.  This helps you take better precaution and protect against later problems – before it becomes visible.</p>

<h2><strong>It’s not just for adults!</strong></h2>
<p>Teaching kids about sun safety is hard when they can't see what you are talking about, but the SmartUV makes this fun for everyone. Sunblock looks black in UV light, showing up uncovered spots when applying it, and when it fades or wears off during the day! Most products wear off in just 2 hours, even without the effects of water or rubbing off on towels which speeds up the process.</p>

<p>Seeing your skin with the SmartUV makes sun safety real and practical. The SmartUV assists in uncovering developing sunspots, monitoring skin damage due to aging, and even getting advance warning of skin health risks that cause melanoma, so you can take proactive measures to make the best decisions for your skin.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>The Nurugo SmartUV team has over 15 years of product engineering experience. With our passion for this project and our previous successful Nurugo Micro Indiegogo project in 2016, we continuously research ways to apply technology in real-life situations and like to explore applications in health and beauty and the micro-world.</p>
<p>We've already completed and tested our SmartUV prototype, so the smartphone software and camera technology has been proven. All that remains now is to create the molds and the manufacturing process to mass produce our final designs to create the production SmartUV, and then to deliver it to people around the world!</p>
<p>We learned a lot from our previous crowdfunding project when we launched the Nurugo Micro - especially about production and shipping management - and we've planned and prepared even more for the SmartUV to ensure a smooth experience for everyone.</p>
<p>However, there are still aspects of this process that may fall outside of our control, such as:</p>
<p>- Unexpected long component leading times  <br/>- Unexpected shortages  <br/>- Any shipping delays outside our control</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we have strong partnerships with every level of our supply chain and every member of the team is dedicated to delivering the best product on time to all of our incredible backers.</p>
</div></div></div>","What exactly is the SmartUV?The SmartUV is a connectable UV camera for smartphones that captures the world in UV light and displays it as a video or picture on your phone screen via the SmartUV App. UV light doesn’t have color as it sits outside the visible light spectrum, which explains why the images are in black and white. White shows where UV light is reflected, and black shows where it is absorbed or blocked. 

The SmartUV is very easy to use. It simply requires you to download the app for your smartphone before plugging the device in by using the connector.
(SmartUV is compatible with the OTG supported smartphones.)
 
Choose your color?
The SmartUV is available in two colors. This custom selection will be confirmed on your perk during the checkout process.

 
What does the SmartUV do?
The SmartUV lets you see into the UV light spectrum – which is completely invisible to the naked eye. By seeing into the UV spectrum, you are able to discover a whole new, previously unexplored world. The SmartUV has many uses that let you test product claims with accuracy and allow you to see yourself and your skin in a whole new light.
 

 
Are your UV protection products actually working?
With the SmartUV you can put spectacles, window tints, and UV skin products – such as sunblock and SPF skincare – to the test to see if they actually do what they claim.
In UV light, UV blocking materials show up black, so it's easy to spot when something is protecting you from harmful rays or not. One of the amazing things you will discover is that even when old and new paint has been matched perfectly and looks identical in visible light, they actually have different densities that is easily revealed with the SmartUV under UV light! That means you can spot where a car panel has been resprayed (indicating accident repairs on a second hand vehicle) or if a room has recently been painted – compared to the rest of the building.
 

 
Unlike other UV imaging solutions, the SmartUV is small in size, which makes it more affordable, more portable and easy to attach to your smartphone.
Because it doesn't require charging, it lets you explore the world in UV, anywhere, anytime.
 

 
But the SmartUV isn’t just any gadget, it also supports a cause we feel passionate about – helping you detect and prevent further sun damage to your skin.

</li>
<li>If we reach <i><i><i>One Million Dollars</i></i></i>, we can take this to mass production, bringing manufacturing costs down and lowering the retail price to $199 (the current retail pricing is estimated at $249).<br/>
</li>
<li>If we make it all the way to <i>Five Million Dollars</i>, we will be able to work on our Satellite Network plan and create the genshi.box Satellite Modem/Antenna Package option; allowing all genshi.box users <b><i>free internet access</i></b> with no monthly fees and no advertisements, ever! (Separate purchase of the Satellite Package would be required.)<br/>
</li>
<li>And one of our long term goals, to go along with our Satellite Network goal, is to create a Non-Profit Organization which will allow us to provide a genshi.box to underprivileged people around the world that could not otherwise afford this technology or who are cut-off from the internet by their repressive regimes; in order to help them become part of the information age by joining the global online community. We hope to accomplish this by donating a genshi.box for every one that is sold, as well as partnering with other Non-Profits and NGOs that can help get the genshi.box out to people with the need for this technology, but without the means.</li>

If we reach our $500,000 stretch goal we will be able to add induction charging to the genshi.box so you never have to remember to charge it; simply place it on it's pad and it's always charging.

If we reach One Million Dollars, we can take this to mass production, bringing manufacturing costs down and lowering the retail price to $199 (the current retail pricing is estimated at $249).

If we make it all the way to Five Million Dollars, we will be able to work on our Satellite Network plan and create the genshi.box Satellite Modem/Antenna Package option; allowing all genshi.box users free internet access with no monthly fees and no advertisements, ever! (Separate purchase of the Satellite Package would be required.)

And one of our long term goals, to go along with our Satellite Network goal, is to create a Non-Profit Organization which will allow us to provide a genshi.box to underprivileged people around the world that could not otherwise afford this technology or who are cut-off from the internet by their repressive regimes; in order to help them become part of the information age by joining the global online community. We hope to accomplish this by donating a genshi.box for every one that is sold, as well as partnering with other Non-Profits and NGOs that can help get the genshi.box out to people with the need for this technology, but without the means.
The Importance Of The genshi.box; Why Everyone Needs This!We here at genshi.lab know this is an important and much needed device for everyone. With the recent news stories of social networking companies collecting, selling and abusing our personal and private information, to the constant bombardment of advertisers and spammers all over the internet, now more than ever is the time that somebody should do something about this, and we have a solution that can really change things and make the online world a better place. This project is so important to us that, even if we do not meet our target goal, we will continue to seek funding through Angel Investors and Venture Capitalists until we can get the genshi.box made and into the hands of everyone. Just imagine, rebooting the internet; creating a new ""World Wide Web 3.0"" free from advertisers, spammers and unscrupulous prying eyes, the way the internet was supposed to be!This can be done, and one way or another, we will make it happen... hopefully with your help!Where We Are In DevelopmentWe've been working on this since August of 2013 (showing the internal workings publicly in September 2013, with LCD Touchscreen for debugging) and we are now at a point to add additional key members to our team to take this proof-of-concept working prototype to a streamlined, production ready product. The next steps will be:
Designing our own proprietary circuit board

Refining the OS

Refining the industrial design of the genshi.box
Developing the Software Packages and Apps (we will have a free iPhone and Android app to access and post to your genshi.box)

Then, when we have a production ready product, we'll move on to:
Designing the retail packaging
Getting product certifications (FCC, etc.)
Designing the supply chain process
Tooling
Materials procurement
Production (we are currently looking at two U.S. manufacturers for the genshi.box)
Our target launch date for indiegogo supporters is 1st Quarter of 2015, and for Retail/Web sales by 2nd Quarter 2015.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you cannot contribute financially, we ask that you get the word out to as many people as possible using the indiegogo share tools. We have a chance here to make the online experience safe and secure, and back under your control, but we can't do it without having as many people as possible believing in this project as much as we believe in it. Help us help the world take back control of their digital lives!",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>A propos de moi et mon équipe</b></p>
<p>J'ai la chance d'être aidée par des personnes fantastiques qui peuvent y consacrer plus ou moins de leur temps, comme  Isabelle Filliozat, Anouk Dubois (formatrice Gordon, dessinatrice), Renate Frotscher (designer web et IU), Serge Vieillescaze (développeur), Rhiannon Blythe, Brigitte Cassette (Altern'Educ Aspre formation parentalité), Christine Malgouyres (animatrice LLL, formatrice Regulation Non Violente des conflicts), Alexandra Cadillac (expert-comptable), ma sœur Hélène Merlin (comédienne, réalisatrice)...</p>
<p><b>Pourquoi moi? </b>Je ne sais pas vraiment, mais j'ai vu se rassembler dans SayKids, pleins d'éléments et d'expériences disparates de ma vie, et soudain, tout a pris un sens fort! Voilà exactement ce que je veux apporter au monde, ce qui vaut la peine, à mes yeux, d'y consacrer ma vie. Goût pour l'aventure, exploration de nouvelles pistes pour les sociétés humaines, aversion pour les rapports de pouvoir, édition, intérêt pour les technologies et sciences concrètement utiles, coup de foudre pour les écrans tactiles, accueil bienveillant des générations futures...</p>

J'interrogerai et j'écouterai mieux ce dont vous avez envie & besoin, je réviserai le budget et j'enlèverai quelques fonctions de l'appli, puis JE LA RÉALISERAI ; ))) En quarante ans de vie, c'est la première fois que je m'implique et me dévoue aussi entièrement.
A propos de moi et mon équipe
J'ai la chance d'être aidée par des personnes fantastiques qui peuvent y consacrer plus ou moins de leur temps, comme  Isabelle Filliozat, Anouk Dubois (formatrice Gordon, dessinatrice), Renate Frotscher (designer web et IU), Serge Vieillescaze (développeur), Rhiannon Blythe, Brigitte Cassette (Altern'Educ Aspre formation parentalité), Christine Malgouyres (animatrice LLL, formatrice Regulation Non Violente des conflicts), Alexandra Cadillac (expert-comptable), ma sœur Hélène Merlin (comédienne, réalisatrice)...
Pourquoi moi? Je ne sais pas vraiment, mais j'ai vu se rassembler dans SayKids, pleins d'éléments et d'expériences disparates de ma vie, et soudain, tout a pris un sens fort! Voilà exactement ce que je veux apporter au monde, ce qui vaut la peine, à mes yeux, d'y consacrer ma vie. Goût pour l'aventure, exploration de nouvelles pistes pour les sociétés humaines, aversion pour les rapports de pouvoir, édition, intérêt pour les technologies et sciences concrètement utiles, coup de foudre pour les écrans tactiles, accueil bienveillant des générations futures...
Et pourquoi vous? Dîtes-moi ce qui vous tient à cœur et comment je peux vous aider! laure@SayKids.co
MERCI MERCI MERCI! Page SayKids en français 
ENGLISH HERE : you're welcome !
End of  the campaign : Thank you all! Neither a success nor a humiliation, it was a very instructive failure, shedding a good light to pursue this adventure! Wishing you the best, thanx again and keep in touch!

Help us give millions of parents, teachers, caregivers, instant access to a clear picture of respectful & efficient communication with kids, in a mobile app, free and ad free!
Look : Demo in slides
 What's in SayKids app?


 


Multiple visual solutions to relationship or communication issues you have with your kid.
Displayed as customized cartoons
All based on positive parenting : mutual respect, efficient communication, emotional literacy, scientific input for thorough understanding of a child's needs, abilities and more.


 





Add to the app : If your family situation is missing on the app we'll draw solutions and add them on. That way everyone in the same situation as you can benefit too.
Customize the ages, looks, names and more : SayKids can also be tailored for grand-parents, teachers, adoptive parents, gay couples, family friends, babysitters, from all origins.
Community features:  Initially SayKids will enable interaction on the website and access to info about meetups (local events already happening or the opportunity to create your own local or interest based group - stay at home dads, parents of twins, Indian mums in Seattle...).  Subsequently, if you help us fly to our stretch goal of 47000€, great community features straight from the app await you.  Permanent 24 hour support to chat things out and vent, directly with other like-minded parents and professionals, and much more.
The premium app has extra customization, access to self coaching features, specific community and more importantly, the ability to add to the app what was missing, to get a personal set of solutions and help all the other users.


What am I offering for your support?
Lifetime premium subscription only on Indiegogo : you are forever special to me, you're here for SayKids from the start - that makes your gifts truly unique too. No lifetime premium offer after the end of the campaign, it's yours for the taking!



Satisfied or your money back guaranteed. I would be sorry to disappoint you & refund you in full. 


Via video call or in person, let me know how I can help you or yours with your parenting goals and more. Every talk or workshop would be prepared to fit your specific needs.

Please note that the app is planned for next spring but the video calls or workshops can be scheduled from October. Let me know if you want another kind of perk package, I'm a fan of win-win negotiation ; )))


Where does your money go?
To build the app, the content, spread the word and interact with users : to make sure you find in SayKids what you need to help you act your best.
I'm bringing in 12000€ personal  loans from a startup support fund and their partner bank, and I'm crowdfunding for 19000€ : you are truly making this project up and running!


What if we don't reach my goal ?
I'll ask and listen better to what you want and need, I'll re-budget and cut some features, and I will GET IT DONE anyway ; ))) I've never been that committed in my previous 40 years of life.


More about me and the team
Great people are involved in the project so far, with more or less of their time, including Isabelle Filliozat (famous French therapist and author), Anouk Dubois (Thomas Gordon P.E.T. & cartoonist), Renate Frotscher (web & UI designer), Serge Vieillescaze (senior developer), Rhiannon Blythe, Brigitte Cassette (alternative parenting support training ASPRE), Christine Malgouyres (LLL leader & NVC), Alexandra Cadillac (expert accountant), my sister Hélène Merlin (actress & short film maker)...
Why me? I don't know why this project dawned on me, but I sure saw all the dots connecting! Wow, what a strange feeling to see very different elements of my past all come together in this project to make sense of my life, and make an impact on the world. Love of adventure, exploring new ways for human societies, dislike of top-down power structures which still plague most work environments, editing, appetite for concretely useful tech and science, crush on touch screens, welcoming next generations...
Why you too? Let me know what you are at and how I can help! laure@SayKids.co

<p><b><span>Let’s say you're on Facebook</span></b> and you see the cutest photo of a dog, one with
the saddest eyes, up for adoption. You already have two dogs so bringing Minnie
into your world isn’t an option. You think of your friends and run down the
list of people that might have a place for her sweet face. You draw a blank.
You reach for your phone; because at the very least you can send the rescue
shelter a few dollars. So that’s what you do, and you bask in the <b>warm glow</b> of
having made a difference, even a small difference in another creature’s life.</p>
<p>Later, Minnie comes to mind when you’re
fixing dinner and you wonder what she’s up to. Is she happy? Is she lonely? How
far did your donation really go? You wish you could do more, but money is hard
to come by. If you only had a way to donate more, especially now, wouldn’t that
be great?</p>

<br/><h2><b>Introducing Adora</b></h2>
<p>Adora is an app that <b>puts the power of
doing good in your hands</b>, using your phone to help you direct donations to your
charity, every day.</p>
<p><b>How does it work? </b></p>
<p>We give you access to amazing ads and offers through the lock screen of your mobile device while making free contributions to the social cause of your choice. It’s not a pop-up – it simply replaces your current lock screen, which keeps you from accidentally pocket dialing or purchasing things on Amazon. </p>
<p>Simply download the app and your current lock screen will be replaced with ours featuring great ads from really cool companies. Don’t like the ad? Let us know by giving it a thumbs down which takes you directly to your home page. Love the ad – give it a thumbs up, share it or save it for later. Don’t have time? Simply slide to unlock your phone. You’re in total control. </p>
<p>Now for the really amazing thing. <b>For simply using the app, Adora will make a free monthly contribution to your favorite social cause.</b> You choose the cause and Adora makes the payment. And the world changes.</p>
<p>Imagine how
good that feels.<b> </b>We see advertisements all the time, but we’ve
never had a say in where some of that money goes. Why not partner with the
advertisers? They provide the funding in return for you viewing their ad, all
so Minnie (and people too) can have a better life! Well, this is why <b>we’ve
chosen you</b> to help make that happen.</p>

<p>Adora is an app that helps anyone and
everyone do good. EVERY day. By simply downloading our app, and using your
phone as you would normally, you can do good for a cause or charity of YOUR
choice. </p>
<p><b>Here’s how
it works</b></p>
<p>You lift your phone to unlock it and
you see an ad from, let’s say <i>Band-Aid</i>®.
When an ad is delivered, a portion of that ad revenue goes directly to your
charity. Even if you ignore it. It’s that simple.  What’s
more, if you don’t like an ad, you can rate it so that we will deliver ads that you can be interested in again. </p>

by telling them, “Hey I’m not a fan of this ad, or your product, or your

who don’t like them. Maybe they can even adapt and listen to that feedback in a
way that could win you over some time in the future, and that is very valuable

<p>We know you have a lot of questions.
Who gets to choose the charities? What if I don’t want to see that ad or brand?
What if I don’t want to see ads at all, can I still help? Does <i>Band-Aid</i> get to tell me who I send the

<h2><b>What are we
asking for?</b></h2>
<p>This project will be our first venture
into changing the world on this scale. We’re just like you, hard working people
who want to do more. We want to know that we are making a difference in the
world. With Adora we believe in the power of the crowd, that small acts by lots
of people make for a BIG difference. Help prove us right!</p>
<p>Our project is a request and an invitation to spread some good karma this holiday season. The money raised will be used in
a way that all of our supporters can feel good about.</p>
<p>We’ve already raised $25,000 of our
own money. We challenge you to help us raise a minimum of $50,000 to get us ready
to deliver the fully realized app to the market. </p>
<p>With your pledges, we’ll build out the
app AND feed people and pets. To get a feel for the power
of your pledge, we will provide at least one meal for a person and  for a pet for
each pledge level funded. Most of our pledge gifts actually have many meals
attached to them. We’d like to feed at least 10,000 people and pets. Will you help us?</p>
<p><b>Why
not just send money to charity?</b> Well, we’d love it if you did that too, but
the reality is, what about next month and the month after that? If you make a
pledge to us, not only will some of the money go to feeding a pet and a person, but every month after that. And that won’t cost you
anything. Now that’s real change. Plus, we have relationships with non-profits
that can deliver meals for pennies, so every dollar stretches far. </p>

<br/>
<h2><b>Pledgers
will make a real impact:</b></h2>
<p>● 
We need to fund the development of the database side of
the platform, the part that allows us to compete with Facebook &amp; Google Ads.
$50,000 helps us complete the app to deliver ads to lock screens and for
development on the back end. </p>
<p>● 
We don't want to wait to do good, so every pledge gift
also delivers a meal to those in need.</p>
<p>● 
The more support we receive, the more we can give! If
we reach 50,000 downloads and $250,000 we will DOUBLE the amount of meals we
provide. If we reach 100,000 downloads and $1,000,000 we will TRIPLE the amount
of meals we fund.</p>
<p><b>Don’t
forget, downloads are as important as donations. </b></p>
<p>We are asking you to support Adora now,<b>
</b>so we can support your charity every day, every month, year in and year out
without any extra time out of your days or any more money coming out of your
pockets.</p>

<p><b>1. 
Download the Adora Charity App</b></p>
<p><b>2.

about Adora. Share our campaign on social media, walk through the streets
yelling… ok you get the point…</b></p>
<p><b>3. 
Finally GO OUT AND DO SOME GOOD! Find a volunteer
opportunity and serve.</b></p>

<h1><b>FAQ's</b></h1>
<p>We know you have a lot of questions so here are some of the most frequently asked! Feel free to leave a comment or email us at info@getadora.com.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>How much money will each charity get?</b></p>
<p>The amount of money a charity gets will depend completely on users and the frequency that ads are delivered. The more users a charity attracts, the more they use their phone, the more money they will receive.</p>
<p></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><span><b>How do I pick my charity?</b></span></p>Users can choose a cause and work with any of the great charities already partnered with us, or they can specify their own. We will contact the charity and ask if they want to receive funds from an Adora user.</div><div>
<p><b>How often will more charities be added to the selection?</b></p>
<p>We will add charities as soon as they have been properly vetted. It’s not a long process, but we want to make sure that any charity we partner with will appropriately use funds donated by our users.</p>
</div><div>
<p><span><b>Would you ever turn down a specific charity? Or are all welcome? </b></span></p>Any nonprofit organization which does political work will be excluded. Funds from Adora will be limited to charities which address the more immediate needs of individuals.<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><span><b>How will my charity be paid?</b></span></p>
<p>Charities that are partnered with Adora will receive monthly or quarterly payments directly from Adora by electronic transfer or check. The amount donated and frequency of payments will be based on user support. Any charity with less than 100 users will receive quarterly payments. The amount of the donation is based on the information a user gives us and the frequency ads are delivered (how often an app user unlocks their phone or views a notification).</p>
<p></p>
<p><span><b>How will I know the charity is actually receiving what you say they're getting?</b></span></p>
<p>We are working on allowing users to receive real time updates. This will allow you to track the amount you have earned for your charity during the month and the total amount you have already donated. Charities will also have an account to track the number of users and the amount they have earned in real time.</p>If you explicitly authorize Adora to share your personal information with your charity of choice, you will be able to request your personal donation information directly from them.<p></p>
<p><span><b>Will I be able to write off my charitable donation on my taxes?</b></span></p>
<p>The revenue which is generated as a result of the ads will not be eligible for tax deductions. However, other donations made out of pocket by you to a charity through Adora will be.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Who will have access to my personal information and how will it be used?</b></p>
<p>Security is very important to us. Personally identifiable information will never be shared with a third party without your express consent. Aggregated user activity may be shared to identify general user characteristics of those who may be most interested in a product, offer, or deal. For example, 13% of men ages 18-34 respond positively to ads for sports related products.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span><b>How often will I be seeing pop-up ads on my phone?</b></span></p>
<p>In addition to ads, offers, news, and sponsored stories, we want to allow users to add in some of their own content like pictures. We also want users to have the option to decide the frequency of ads. The more ads delivered, the more you generate for your cause. </p>
<p></p>
<p><span><b>Is having it going to slow down my phone, take too much memory?</b></span></p>
<p>No. Most advertising content is pretty small. Content will be loaded and stored onto your mobile device when you are connected to wifi. This way it will simply pull a small stored file that takes no time at all.</p>
<p><span><b>Will you accept anyone as one of your advertisers, or will you be selective about who can advertise?</b></span></p>
<p>It’s important for us to use discretion when advertising products. While we anticipate working with most advertisers, we will not show any imagery which we do not deem as being family friendly. We know that anyone can pick up your phone, so the ads delivered cannot be suggestive in any way. <span>We are sensitive to our charity partners who work in a wide range of causes and must ensure that our ads do not contradict the good work they do.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span><b>What if I don't want to be associated with a certain advertiser, what can I do to stop getting pop ups from them?</b></span></p>Our innovative lockscreen will allow users to give direct feedback about ads and advertisers. Simply give it a thumbs down and our learning engine will learn your preferences. You can learn more about the learning engine on our website, <a href=""http://getadora.com/adora-app/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://getadora.com/adora-app/</a>.</div><div>
<span><b><br/>What do you (Adora) get out of doing this?</b></span><br/><br/>We get the opportunity to change the way charity is done. We are a for-profit company, but we know that when we succeed, the causes we are so passionate about do even better.<br/>

who want to do more. We want to know that we are making a difference in the
world. With Adora we believe in the power of the crowd, that small acts by lots
of people make for a BIG difference. Help prove us right!
Our project is a request and an invitation to spread some good karma this holiday season. The money raised will be used in
a way that all of our supporters can feel good about.
We’ve already raised $25,000 of our
own money. We challenge you to help us raise a minimum of $50,000 to get us ready
to deliver the fully realized app to the market. 
With your pledges, we’ll build out the
app AND feed people and pets. To get a feel for the power
of your pledge, we will provide at least one meal for a person and  for a pet for
each pledge level funded. Most of our pledge gifts actually have many meals
attached to them. We’d like to feed at least 10,000 people and pets. Will you help us?
Why
not just send money to charity? Well, we’d love it if you did that too, but
the reality is, what about next month and the month after that? If you make a
pledge to us, not only will some of the money go to feeding a pet and a person, but every month after that. And that won’t cost you
anything. Now that’s real change. Plus, we have relationships with non-profits
that can deliver meals for pennies, so every dollar stretches far. 






Pledgers
will make a real impact:
● 
We need to fund the development of the database side of
the platform, the part that allows us to compete with Facebook & Google Ads.
$50,000 helps us complete the app to deliver ads to lock screens and for
development on the back end. 
● 
We don't want to wait to do good, so every pledge gift
also delivers a meal to those in need.
● 
The more support we receive, the more we can give! If
we reach 50,000 downloads and $250,000 we will DOUBLE the amount of meals we
provide. If we reach 100,000 downloads and $1,000,000 we will TRIPLE the amount
of meals we fund.
Don’t
forget, downloads are as important as donations. 
We are asking you to support Adora now,
so we can support your charity every day, every month, year in and year out
without any extra time out of your days or any more money coming out of your
pockets.




Once you contribute, just mention your
intention to do some good in the comment section of this campaign, let us know
your thoughts, and give us your feedback.
Other Ways
You Can Help
The
key to doing more good is the crowd. The more people we have doing good,
the more powerful we are, the more valuable our ads are, and the more each of
us can give through the Adora App. There are three other ways you can help in
addition to contributing to our campaign:
1. 
Download the Adora Charity App
2. 
Tell everyone you know and even people you don’t know
about Adora. Share our campaign on social media, walk through the streets
yelling… ok you get the point…
3. 
Finally GO OUT AND DO SOME GOOD! Find a volunteer
opportunity and serve.

Even if you can't contribute to our
campaign you can download the Adora App and you can go out and do some good. You can even inspire others by sharing your story on our Facebook Page; that alone
will spread good karma and put that positive energy into the world.
You can also share our campaign on
social media, tell your friends about Adora, you can volunteer at a food bank,
soup kitchen, or rescue mission or even just get some friends together and go
feed some people all on your own. 

Together WE can make a difference - Let’s do some good!
FAQ's
We know you have a lot of questions so here are some of the most frequently asked! Feel free to leave a comment or email us at info@getadora.com.


How much money will each charity get?
The amount of money a charity gets will depend completely on users and the frequency that ads are delivered. The more users a charity attracts, the more they use their phone, the more money they will receive.

How do I pick my charity?Users can choose a cause and work with any of the great charities already partnered with us, or they can specify their own. We will contact the charity and ask if they want to receive funds from an Adora user.
How often will more charities be added to the selection?
We will add charities as soon as they have been properly vetted. It’s not a long process, but we want to make sure that any charity we partner with will appropriately use funds donated by our users.

Would you ever turn down a specific charity? Or are all welcome? Any nonprofit organization which does political work will be excluded. Funds from Adora will be limited to charities which address the more immediate needs of individuals.

How will my charity be paid?
Charities that are partnered with Adora will receive monthly or quarterly payments directly from Adora by electronic transfer or check. The amount donated and frequency of payments will be based on user support. Any charity with less than 100 users will receive quarterly payments. The amount of the donation is based on the information a user gives us and the frequency ads are delivered (how often an app user unlocks their phone or views a notification).

How will I know the charity is actually receiving what you say they're getting?
We are working on allowing users to receive real time updates. This will allow you to track the amount you have earned for your charity during the month and the total amount you have already donated. Charities will also have an account to track the number of users and the amount they have earned in real time.If you explicitly authorize Adora to share your personal information with your charity of choice, you will be able to request your personal donation information directly from them.
Will I be able to write off my charitable donation on my taxes?
The revenue which is generated as a result of the ads will not be eligible for tax deductions. However, other donations made out of pocket by you to a charity through Adora will be.

Who will have access to my personal information and how will it be used?
Security is very important to us. Personally identifiable information will never be shared with a third party without your express consent. Aggregated user activity may be shared to identify general user characteristics of those who may be most interested in a product, offer, or deal. For example, 13% of men ages 18-34 respond positively to ads for sports related products.


How often will I be seeing pop-up ads on my phone?
In addition to ads, offers, news, and sponsored stories, we want to allow users to add in some of their own content like pictures. We also want users to have the option to decide the frequency of ads. The more ads delivered, the more you generate for your cause. 

Is having it going to slow down my phone, take too much memory?
No. Most advertising content is pretty small. Content will be loaded and stored onto your mobile device when you are connected to wifi. This way it will simply pull a small stored file that takes no time at all.
Will you accept anyone as one of your advertisers, or will you be selective about who can advertise?
It’s important for us to use discretion when advertising products. While we anticipate working with most advertisers, we will not show any imagery which we do not deem as being family friendly. We know that anyone can pick up your phone, so the ads delivered cannot be suggestive in any way. We are sensitive to our charity partners who work in a wide range of causes and must ensure that our ads do not contradict the good work they do.

What if I don't want to be associated with a certain advertiser, what can I do to stop getting pop ups from them?Our innovative lockscreen will allow users to give direct feedback about ads and advertisers. Simply give it a thumbs down and our learning engine will learn your preferences. You can learn more about the learning engine on our website, http://getadora.com/adora-app/.
What do you (Adora) get out of doing this?We get the opportunity to change the way charity is done. We are a for-profit company, but we know that when we succeed, the causes we are so passionate about do even better.

<p>At the heart of Alt is a powerful mounting system using neodymium
 magnets, a small but very strong type of magnet. No more clips or grips
 that require you to push a release button or pry open arms to release 
your iPhone. To mount, just place your iPhone on the magnetic mount and 
it will securely hold the phone in place. To release, just pull the 
phone away.  NOTE: The magnetic system does not affect the iPhone's operation, 
camera, lens/flash, ApplePay, charging, or battery life.</p>

<h4>Simple Installation Of Wall Mounts &amp; Car Mounts <br/>
</h4>
<p>The wall 
mount can be attached to any surface: wood, metal, painted walls, even 
textured walls. At the back of the wall mount is a padded peel-off 
sticky pad. It's easy to fix onto any surface you choose. It is also 
easy to remove later on and leaves no residue, so no worries about 
leaving sticky gunk behind.</p>

car. It works on most flat type vents, and even works with many circular
 vent designs.</p>

<p><b>Where we are in the process </b></p>
<p>We have completed 3 rounds of prototypes, the latest prototypes 
are highly accurate and the mod-3 team have been using them in our daily
 routine. The next stage is to complete a test (soft) mould to ensure 
fit, engineering accuracy and manufacturing tolerance. After the test 
mould and final testing is complete, the production mould will be 
ordered, which takes 1-2 weeks. We have a series of advanced prototypes 
for the case, wall mount and car mount, which gets us very close to the 
final version at this time.</p>

<h4>Risks and challenges</h4>
<p>Alt is based on the design of our first case, RADIUS, which is now a
 proven product, with a growing global fan base. This is a huge 
advantage, both from an engineering and manufacturing perspective, as we
 have taken all the learning from earlier designs forward to create Alt.</p>
<p>Our biggest challenge is manufacturing, with careful attention 
required to ensure that production meets the stringent quality 
requirements we expect from a product that comes from the mod-3 name. </p>
<p>To guarantee quality and delivery schedules we have chosen to work 
with a local manufacturing operation in the San Francisco Bay Area. This
 ensures that if any issues or delays occur, we can react instantly and 
work through solutions quickly.</p>

 impact-resistance and the X-shaped design helps to disperse the force of impact. The outer shell features a soft-touch, non-slip finish that improves your grip on your iPhone.






However careful you are with your iPhone, drops and knocks are 
inevitable. Through extensive research, we've discovered that when these
 accidents do occur, the corners are the most vulnerable. That’s why we 
have focused protection at these points of impacts.





















Alt's design is simple, minimalist and modern, just like your 
iPhone. We’ve worked tirelessly to make sure that Alt perfectly 
complements the iPhone it protects. Every line serves a purpose.







Convenient Cable Organizer 

No more fishing cables from the floor.



Simply touch the end of your charging cable to the car or wall mount and 
it’s held firm until you need it next. 






Your Alt mount also works great as key ring holders. Actually, it can hold anything that's steel or magnetic! 














Easy-on, Easy-off Magnetic Mounting



At the heart of Alt is a powerful mounting system using neodymium
 magnets, a small but very strong type of magnet. No more clips or grips
 that require you to push a release button or pry open arms to release 
your iPhone. To mount, just place your iPhone on the magnetic mount and 
it will securely hold the phone in place. To release, just pull the 
phone away.  NOTE: The magnetic system does not affect the iPhone's operation, 
camera, lens/flash, ApplePay, charging, or battery life.




Installation is a snap!








Simple Installation Of Wall Mounts & Car Mounts 

The wall 
mount can be attached to any surface: wood, metal, painted walls, even 
textured walls. At the back of the wall mount is a padded peel-off 
sticky pad. It's easy to fix onto any surface you choose. It is also 
easy to remove later on and leaves no residue, so no worries about 
leaving sticky gunk behind.

The car mount clips directly to the A/C vents in almost any 
car. It works on most flat type vents, and even works with many circular
 vent designs.






Every Alt case comes with a matching color wall mount. 
Each wall mount is supplied with extra sticky pads so you can move your 
mount if required. Please specify size (6/6s or 6 Plus/6s Plus) and 
color of your reward. The car mount comes in black. 






Go with matching color case or contrasting color with your iPhone, or get more than one color! Have fun!









Where we are in the process 
We have completed 3 rounds of prototypes, the latest prototypes 
are highly accurate and the mod-3 team have been using them in our daily
 routine. The next stage is to complete a test (soft) mould to ensure 
fit, engineering accuracy and manufacturing tolerance. After the test 
mould and final testing is complete, the production mould will be 
ordered, which takes 1-2 weeks. We have a series of advanced prototypes 
for the case, wall mount and car mount, which gets us very close to the 
final version at this time.





 Stay in touch with us!






Risks and challenges
Alt is based on the design of our first case, RADIUS, which is now a
 proven product, with a growing global fan base. This is a huge 
advantage, both from an engineering and manufacturing perspective, as we
 have taken all the learning from earlier designs forward to create Alt.
Our biggest challenge is manufacturing, with careful attention 
required to ensure that production meets the stringent quality 
requirements we expect from a product that comes from the mod-3 name. 
To guarantee quality and delivery schedules we have chosen to work 
with a local manufacturing operation in the San Francisco Bay Area. This
 ensures that if any issues or delays occur, we can react instantly and 
work through solutions quickly.",20.0,7,"2 Campaigns

<p></p>
<p>The MOTI was created by Donald Chew, who has a strong passion for
solving the problems throughout the paid tv industry using a common sense approach. Chew was inspired to design the MOTI device while reading numerous articles about the cable TV industry, and studying its multitude of  problems.  The industry for years has used the same type of medium for decades to deliver cable TV and internet to your home.  This coupled with the never-ending customer service <u><strong>problems</strong>/ issues, charging higher prices, and companies merging to become larger and larger</u> has created a hunger to change this.  While the industry has evolved, the delivery method stays the same and as a result they have forgotten about the customer.  Today, in order to receive cable and the internet in your home, wires need to be installed and connected in some way to access the internet and to receive cable.  Also keep in mind that 4 of the world’s largest cable tv and internet provider’s rank at the top of the list for the worst customer service.</p>
<p>With a long list of problems in hand, Chew set out to create the perfect device that would be the <u><strong>solution</strong></u> to the customer service issue, make it affordable, while at the same time delivering on functionality. As a result, our team has worked tirelessly over the past 18 months to bring the MOTI device from an idea, to sketches on a piece of paper, taking steps to build a real life prototype. Thanks to the amazing public support and feedback thus far, we are now seeking support via this campaign to complete, fine tune the prototype, and mass produce this device.  We would like to present to you the worlds first wireless Wi-Fi and cable tv device.  Our goal is to get this device in as many homes as we possibly can around the world.  </p>
<p><strong>THE MOTI DEVICE WILL SOLVE THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS BY OFFERING THE SOLUTIONS </strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>The MOTI device (Patent Pending) is a device that allows consumers to access Wi-Fi and cable TV without any wires. </p>
<p>The purpose of creating a device like this does a couple of things:</p>
<p>1.<strong> Problem:</strong> Customer service is a HUGE problem that has plagued the cable</p>
<p>industry for years. (Today, anyone who wants to reach customer service must call</p>
<p>in to reach customer service. The results have been horrible with long wait times,</p>
<p>rude customer service, being disconnected. Etc.)</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> The MOTI has a built in button called the MOTI button that can be</p>
<p>pressed and our customer service team will contact you. (Think On-star that’s</p>
<p>installed in cars).</p>
<p> 2. <strong>Problem:</strong> 125+ channels are currently offered as part of a bundled package to</p>
<p>consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> The Moti device will come with a cloud based app that will allow the</p>
<p>customers to choose the channels that they would like to watch. (A la Carte).</p>
<p>3. <strong>Problem:</strong> Once you order service, you are given a time/window for an installation</p>
<p> technician to come out to your home.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> The MOTI device eliminates the need for this because once ordered.</p>
<p>The device is pre-programmed for your household and simply must be activated upon receipt by pressing the MOTI button.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>

<p><strong><strong>What sets the MOTI device apart from
the current cable providers and streaming devices out there today?</strong></strong><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>Our MOTI
device is truly different because today’s cable and satellite providers
like Comcast, Time Warner, or DIRECTV need to have a wired connection to get
cable and Wi-Fi into the home.  Streaming
devices the Roku, or Apple TV, and the Fire stick are plug and play but
you need a separate Wi-Fi connection for these to work.  With our MOTI device, you don’t need to have
this because it is built into the device. 
No more waiting for installation guys to show up at your home, no more
calling for customer service because we call you.  All you have to do is press the MOTI button
on the device and our customer service staff will contact you.  </p>
<p>· ALWAYS STAY UP TO DATE - Easy and simple Over-The-Air
updates means that you will automatically always have the newest and greatest
movies, TV shows, games and apps at your fingertips!</p>
<p>· BEST WARRANTY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE - GUARANTEED!
The MOTI has a 1 year warranty. No matter what happens to your device,
all you need are batteries, our customer service team will make sure it is
running flawlessly at ALL times. If you need to reach our team, you will simply
need to <strong><u>PRESS</u> the MOTI button on your device and our team will <u>CALL
YOU</u> and <u>HAPPILY</u> be able to answer any questions you may have</strong>.  No more being transferred to 10 different
people, repeating the same information because <strong><u>OUR STAFF WILL CALL YOU</u></strong>  and will be
able to handle Wi-fi, cable, and billing issues any questions you may have - and
with MOTI Support automatically installed on each device, we can see what’s
going on and resolve anything that may be causing issues immediately!</p>

<p><strong>4.  What is On-Time and what does it have
to do with the MOTI device?</strong></p>
<p>On-Time Communications, dba, On-Time
Cable is the company that is being started to create competition in the Cable
Industry.<span>  (Application Pending with FCC)  The MOTI device is our brand builder and the
device that connects everything and bring the service from On-Time to you using

<p><strong>6.  What countries and mobile networks will

<p>The MOTI device works as an open
device, not locked to any particular network. It works in all countries that
have cable wires underground or Satellite accessibility.<span>  It will also support the two LTE standards to
provide 4G mobile broadband connectivity around the world (subject to network

<p></p></div>","Why We Are here 

The MOTI was created by Donald Chew, who has a strong passion for
solving the problems throughout the paid tv industry using a common sense approach. Chew was inspired to design the MOTI device while reading numerous articles about the cable TV industry, and studying its multitude of  problems.  The industry for years has used the same type of medium for decades to deliver cable TV and internet to your home.  This coupled with the never-ending customer service problems/ issues, charging higher prices, and companies merging to become larger and larger has created a hunger to change this.  While the industry has evolved, the delivery method stays the same and as a result they have forgotten about the customer.  Today, in order to receive cable and the internet in your home, wires need to be installed and connected in some way to access the internet and to receive cable.  Also keep in mind that 4 of the world’s largest cable tv and internet provider’s rank at the top of the list for the worst customer service.
With a long list of problems in hand, Chew set out to create the perfect device that would be the solution to the customer service issue, make it affordable, while at the same time delivering on functionality. As a result, our team has worked tirelessly over the past 18 months to bring the MOTI device from an idea, to sketches on a piece of paper, taking steps to build a real life prototype. Thanks to the amazing public support and feedback thus far, we are now seeking support via this campaign to complete, fine tune the prototype, and mass produce this device.  We would like to present to you the worlds first wireless Wi-Fi and cable tv device.  Our goal is to get this device in as many homes as we possibly can around the world.  
THE MOTI DEVICE WILL SOLVE THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS BY OFFERING THE SOLUTIONS 

The MOTI device (Patent Pending) is a device that allows consumers to access Wi-Fi and cable TV without any wires. 
The purpose of creating a device like this does a couple of things:
1. Problem: Customer service is a HUGE problem that has plagued the cable
industry for years. (Today, anyone who wants to reach customer service must call
in to reach customer service. The results have been horrible with long wait times,
rude customer service, being disconnected. Etc.)
Solution: The MOTI has a built in button called the MOTI button that can be
pressed and our customer service team will contact you. (Think On-star that’s
installed in cars).
 2. Problem: 125+ channels are currently offered as part of a bundled package to
consumers.
Solution: The Moti device will come with a cloud based app that will allow the
customers to choose the channels that they would like to watch. (A la Carte).
3. Problem: Once you order service, you are given a time/window for an installation
 technician to come out to your home.
Solution: The MOTI device eliminates the need for this because once ordered.
The device is pre-programmed for your household and simply must be activated upon receipt by pressing the MOTI button.

What sets the MOTI device apart from
the current cable providers and streaming devices out there today?
Our MOTI
device is truly different because today’s cable and satellite providers
like Comcast, Time Warner, or DIRECTV need to have a wired connection to get
cable and Wi-Fi into the home.  Streaming
devices the Roku, or Apple TV, and the Fire stick are plug and play but
you need a separate Wi-Fi connection for these to work.  With our MOTI device, you don’t need to have
this because it is built into the device. 
No more waiting for installation guys to show up at your home, no more
calling for customer service because we call you.  All you have to do is press the MOTI button
on the device and our customer service staff will contact you.  
· ALWAYS STAY UP TO DATE - Easy and simple Over-The-Air
updates means that you will automatically always have the newest and greatest
movies, TV shows, games and apps at your fingertips!

The MOTI has a 1 year warranty. No matter what happens to your device,
all you need are batteries, our customer service team will make sure it is
running flawlessly at ALL times. If you need to reach our team, you will simply
need to PRESS the MOTI button on your device and our team will CALL
YOU and HAPPILY be able to answer any questions you may have.  No more being transferred to 10 different
people, repeating the same information because OUR STAFF WILL CALL YOU  and will be
able to handle Wi-fi, cable, and billing issues any questions you may have - and
with MOTI Support automatically installed on each device, we can see what’s
going on and resolve anything that may be causing issues immediately!

Braggs.  I am the creator and founder of Applause Network TV, Inc and I am asking for your financial support for an internet television network that not only plans to provide over the top original entertainment for you, but will provide a distribution platform for your peers who are independent talented writers, directors and producers in need of a distribution outlet that goes directly to the audience.  Also, I am an independent screenplay writer and director.  After frustrating years of shopping my projects to major studios, I decided to create a distribution vehicle where I and other writers, directors and producers could maintain ownership of our creative property while displaying it to a mass audience.  Applause Network is that vehicle.  CHEERS TO NEW MEDIA!  Your contributions will help us launch the network in December 2014 and bring you content that was written, exclusively for Applause Network TV, by some of the most creative folks who have yet to be discovered in the entertainment industry.  ...And by the way, you could be one of those creative individuals with the right project for Applause Network TV.  We support the independent community and are always in the market for original ideas and content such as films of all genres, reality shows, live concerts and sporting events.  To learn how to submit your project, go to <a href=""http://www.applausenetwork.tv"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.applausenetwork.tv</a> and click feedback/contact us at the bottom of the homepage.  Send us a message containing a very brief description of your project and we will contact you with submission information.  All films created exclusively for Applause Network TV will be registered with the Screen Actor's Guild under New Media/low budget.</span></h3><h3>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span><br/>
</h3> <p>We are seeking to raise $1.4 million dollars within the next 60 days in order to launch in December 2014.  Funds will be used for the following:</p><p>1.  One time purchase  of video cameras, lighting equipment and sound equipment that will enable us to avoid the repeated cost of renting equipment for each production and it enables us to produce more shows within a shorter period of time.  This will result in having more shows available on the website. Also, it enables us to cut cost by producing projects for other writers, directors and producers who have great ideas but don't have the financial means to produce their shows.    </p><p>2.  Create our own editing studio.  This is important because we can edit our own shows and avoid piracy and theft of our creative content.</p><p>3.  Pay licensing fees for content belonging to other directors/producers.</p><p>4.  Pay admin staff.  </p><p>5.  Pay location fees.</p><p>6.  Pay administrative over head cost.</p><p>7.  Maintain the website and the security of the website.</p><p>PERKS CONSIST OF - Depending upon your contribution, perks that are being offered are free annual membership, exclusive emails about inside productions and actors, exclusive internet screenings, visit to the sets of shows produced in New York City, free admissions to comedy shows and concerts, a part as an extra in certain shows, associate producer credits, free access to on demand shows of your choosing, free access to live shows that are streamed on the website and an exclusive invitation to our launch party.</p><p>GOALS - It is my prayer that we reach our gold of $1.4 million dollars in 60 days.  It is time for change in the entertainment industry for independents who lack the resources of the large movie distributors and the ability to gain access to distribution because we're too small to matter...essentially ""nobodies."" Certainly, there are many more who would agree with me than not...  However, that said, if we do not reach our intended goal of $1.4 million dollars, I will continue to find creative ways to reach our launching goal of December 2014 with the funds that we acquire.   We will use a scaled down approach to make as much content available at that time as possible.  If necessary, we will rent production equipment and produce shows that are 30 minutes in length as opposed to 60 minutes or longer until we acquire the a funding that will allow us to do more.  However, I will not enter into any financial deals where ownership of any of the content displayed on Applause Network TV belonging to independent writers, directors and producers is compromised.  </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">The Impact</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Applause Network TV will prove to be a major contender in the entertainment industry by providing a platform for the stars of tomorrow.  It will be the place that all eyes are on when it comes to searching for talented writers, directors, producers, actors, singers and dancers.  This talent may very well be you, your neighbor, relative or friend that you are supporting by contributing to the funding campaign of Applause Network TV.  Through advertising, we have the potential to reach people all over the world.  This is a concept that's easy to grasp when you consider the potential that the internet has created with all of the information, resources and volumes of people accessing the web daily.  Our goal is to provide that vehicle for those seeking exposure and entertain the heck out of everybody while doing it.  </span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</span></p> <p>One possible risk is not acquiring enough funding to offer the quality of shows that an HBO, SHOWTIME, BRAVO or other networks that stream on the internet are able to offer.  It is our intention to offer shows that are 30, 60 and 120 minutes long.

Braggs.  I am the creator and founder of Applause Network TV, Inc and I am asking for your financial support for an internet television network that not only plans to provide over the top original entertainment for you, but will provide a distribution platform for your peers who are independent talented writers, directors and producers in need of a distribution outlet that goes directly to the audience.  Also, I am an independent screenplay writer and director.  After frustrating years of shopping my projects to major studios, I decided to create a distribution vehicle where I and other writers, directors and producers could maintain ownership of our creative property while displaying it to a mass audience.  Applause Network is that vehicle.  CHEERS TO NEW MEDIA!  Your contributions will help us launch the network in December 2014 and bring you content that was written, exclusively for Applause Network TV, by some of the most creative folks who have yet to be discovered in the entertainment industry.  ...And by the way, you could be one of those creative individuals with the right project for Applause Network TV.  We support the independent community and are always in the market for original ideas and content such as films of all genres, reality shows, live concerts and sporting events.  To learn how to submit your project, go to www.applausenetwork.tv and click feedback/contact us at the bottom of the homepage.  Send us a message containing a very brief description of your project and we will contact you with submission information.  All films created exclusively for Applause Network TV will be registered with the Screen Actor's Guild under New Media/low budget.
What We Need & What You Get
 We are seeking to raise $1.4 million dollars within the next 60 days in order to launch in December 2014.  Funds will be used for the following:1.  One time purchase  of video cameras, lighting equipment and sound equipment that will enable us to avoid the repeated cost of renting equipment for each production and it enables us to produce more shows within a shorter period of time.  This will result in having more shows available on the website. Also, it enables us to cut cost by producing projects for other writers, directors and producers who have great ideas but don't have the financial means to produce their shows.    2.  Create our own editing studio.  This is important because we can edit our own shows and avoid piracy and theft of our creative content.3.  Pay licensing fees for content belonging to other directors/producers.4.  Pay admin staff.  5.  Pay location fees.6.  Pay administrative over head cost.7.  Maintain the website and the security of the website.PERKS CONSIST OF - Depending upon your contribution, perks that are being offered are free annual membership, exclusive emails about inside productions and actors, exclusive internet screenings, visit to the sets of shows produced in New York City, free admissions to comedy shows and concerts, a part as an extra in certain shows, associate producer credits, free access to on demand shows of your choosing, free access to live shows that are streamed on the website and an exclusive invitation to our launch party.GOALS - It is my prayer that we reach our gold of $1.4 million dollars in 60 days.  It is time for change in the entertainment industry for independents who lack the resources of the large movie distributors and the ability to gain access to distribution because we're too small to matter...essentially ""nobodies."" Certainly, there are many more who would agree with me than not...  However, that said, if we do not reach our intended goal of $1.4 million dollars, I will continue to find creative ways to reach our launching goal of December 2014 with the funds that we acquire.   We will use a scaled down approach to make as much content available at that time as possible.  If necessary, we will rent production equipment and produce shows that are 30 minutes in length as opposed to 60 minutes or longer until we acquire the a funding that will allow us to do more.  However, I will not enter into any financial deals where ownership of any of the content displayed on Applause Network TV belonging to independent writers, directors and producers is compromised.  The ImpactApplause Network TV will prove to be a major contender in the entertainment industry by providing a platform for the stars of tomorrow.  It will be the place that all eyes are on when it comes to searching for talented writers, directors, producers, actors, singers and dancers.  This talent may very well be you, your neighbor, relative or friend that you are supporting by contributing to the funding campaign of Applause Network TV.  Through advertising, we have the potential to reach people all over the world.  This is a concept that's easy to grasp when you consider the potential that the internet has created with all of the information, resources and volumes of people accessing the web daily.  Our goal is to provide that vehicle for those seeking exposure and entertain the heck out of everybody while doing it.  Risks & Challenges One possible risk is not acquiring enough funding to offer the quality of shows that an HBO, SHOWTIME, BRAVO or other networks that stream on the internet are able to offer.  It is our intention to offer shows that are 30, 60 and 120 minutes long. However, as already stated, we are talented enough to scale down the shows and keep you entertained.  But it would be so much more fun if you could receive more of the delicious shows that we have lined up for you...Hacking is another possible and real risk.  However, we have put in place firewalls, security measures and security certificates that keep all content and personal information of our users safe.   Other Ways You Can HelpThere are other ways that you can assist us if you can't provide a financial donation, send a shout out to a friend or relative about Applause Network TV and ask them to support us. You can also stay abreast of what's happening, prior to our launch date, by going to our website and joining our newsletter at www.applausenetwork.tv. You can also follow us on TWITTER at twitter.com/applausentv and on FACEBOOK at facebook.com/applausenetworktv. Also, remember to use Indiegogo's share tools!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My grandma looooves knitting. As does pretty much any Bulgarian grandma. But I just couldn't use any more sweaters and socks and even all my electronics are now nicely snug, so my friends thought that they are so nice we should do something about it - especially given that there are other good knitters like my grandma who really need some extra income. So we created Snug Essentials and found a few more women (exactly 4 at the moment) to help us.</p>
<p>We thought: what if we could empower hundreds or thousands of women make a better living turning a hobby they enjoy into a reliable source of income? What if we showed the world what these Bulgarian women can do and the world fell in love with their knitting? <strong><br/><br/></strong>We bought some local yarn and started experimenting with making laptop sleeves in various colours and patterns. The results were stylish laptop sleeves that all our friends liked so much that they wanted to buy them right away. That’s why we’re here on IndieGoGo to get the support we need to start this project for real.</p>

<li>Worked with the most experienced knitters to produce samples that we and our friends are now using constantly. So far they are doing wonderfully and we completely believe in them!</li>
<li>Launched our website. We used our limited financial resources to purchase hosting and a domain and are developing its awesome design at the moment.</li>
<li>Started reaching out to women who could use our support and are quickly building a network of wonderful devoted knitters. It’s been really motivational to listen to their dreams of what they will be able to do when “the business picks up”.</li>

<p>An online photo auction and gallery for smartphone photography, offering users exposure and revenue for their images.</p></strong><p></p>
<p>  AN INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>  The idea is simple: make money with your SmartPhone photography!</p>
<p>  Millions of photos are uploaded to the internet every day through sites and apps like Pinterest and Instagram. Excellent photography can now be fun and easy: and if you’re good at it, why restrict your work to your friends and family? The SmartPhone Photography MarketPlace and Gallery and accompanying app, PhotoScramble, are designed to meet two main goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong> to generate revenue for camera-phone photographers</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong> and to give their work worldwide exposure: 24/7.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The marketplace will also place emphasis on viewer/creator interaction,including subscription tools and other ways to communicate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>  So, how does it work?</strong> </p>
<p>At its core, the SmartPhone Photography MarketPlace and Gallery is just that: a gallery of images uploaded from different users all over the world. Photographers will be able to put up their work on a live auction, used by consumers of photos and art. Artists looking for stock photography, advertising agencies, and individuals looking for original artwork to own are among the types of people who will most likely be bidding on your photos. </p>
<p>The person who bids the highest (or pays the Buy It Now price) will receive the photograph in print and be given the rights to use it.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<p>Instead of a lemonade stand,a girl who owns a smartphone and enjoys taking snapshots of animals around her town wants to learn about e commerce and sell her photos for extra cash to donate to the SPCA</p>
<p>a Business traveler has accumulated great travel and vacation images that he would like to get published and see his name in print (credit line) to show his kids that he is an  accomplished photographer</p>
<p>a Student with a camera-phone has an idea for an educational project that he would like to receive ""feedback"" and communication.</p>
<p>In addition to photo auctions, the Gallery and Auction also offers<strong> ad revenue to its users</strong>--so even if you’re not selling the rights to your image, you’re still earning money.</p>
<p>Informative You Tube Video:<a href=""http://youtu.be/ZSXzWwNpVg8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://youtu.be/ZSXzWwNpVg8</a></p>
<p> <strong> A VALUABLE AND EASY-TO-USE PHOTO APP: PhotoScramble</strong></p>
<p>  PhotoScramble is designed to be easy, intuitive, and directly interfaced to the Picture Gallery. With your help, we can create a thriving worldwide marketplace for amateur photographers, providing a service much-needed in today’s visually competitive world.</p>
<p>  The PhotoScramble app will retail for approximately $4.95 - $9.95 USD. After purchasing and downloading the app, users will have access to editing tools (similar to Instagram) and a direct upload to the online Photo Gallery. When uploading images, <strong>users will be able to add titles, descriptions, and their social media information--</strong>allowing for the growth of a global community. The users will be able to put up their work for auction, or simply have it up for display and collect ad revenue.</p>
<p>  App.net confirmed there is nothing like it and it is needed in the app market: a way for users to edit, <strong>add special effects to, upload, and monetize their photos.</strong> There is a clear need for PhotoScramble in the industry, and with the correct funding, it is certain to take off.</p>
<p>  <strong><em>For a quick example,</em></strong> take a girl who owns a smartphone and enjoys taking snapshots of animals around her town. Once she purchases and downloads the PhotoScramble app, she will be able to use it to edit her photos to perfection. PhotoScramble will then let her upload her images to the Picture Gallery. She will choose whether she would like to retain the rights and simply collect ad revenue, or put up the photo for auction and see who is interested in buying it from her. It’s easy, intuitive, and will earn her money.</p>

<p><strong>  HOW YOU CAN HELP</strong></p>
<p>  If an app and marketplace <strong>where you can earn money (and HELP others do the same thing) </strong>using SmartPhone photography sounds good to you, we encourage you to consider pledging any amount. Developing an app and marketplace to be easily accessible to the public is no easy task. There are many steps along the road, but with the experience of producer Art Marketing Agency, a step-by-step plan has been laid out for the allocation of funds. </p>
<p><strong>Funds will be used to support these three goals:</strong></p>
<p> Goal #1: Advertising and Branding</p>
<p>  In order to make this project a global platform, we will need to advertise on search engines and in photography print magazines.</p>
<p>Our targets include the following: Bing, Google Adwords, StumbleUpon, Mashable , Yahoo Search Marketing, Tumblr, Twitter Ads, Delicious,  Modern Photography, and Popular Photography.</p>
<p>Goal #2: Search Engine Optimization</p>
<p>  An essential part of promotion is search engine optimization--making sure that users and potential users will be able to find the Gallery easily. This step includes:</p>
<ul>  <li><p>Search Engine Marketing (SEO)</p></li>
<li><p>Promotions with Google, Yahoo, Bing</p></li>
</ul>
<p>  The <em>expertise of the Art Marketing Agency </em>is also essential for this step of the process.</p>
<p>  Goal #3: Website Design and Maintenance</p>
<p>  This includes the actual development and maintenance of the website and app. These things take some time to set up and all software will be made as user-friendly as possible, which requires plenty of beta testing, redesigning, and maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>REWARDS AND INCENTIVES</strong></p>
<p>  Any amount, no matter how small, is appreciated and goes toward the development of this marketplace. However, pledging an amount equal to or greater than $25 nets you unique rewards with the SmartPhone Picture Gallery system as soon as it is up and running. Be among the first <strong>to upload your images</strong>--at no additional cost to your pledge--to our Picture Gallery and begin to earn money with them. You will also receive a 11 x 14 custom photo print <em>of your choice </em>from the auction. </p>
<p><strong>The greater your pledge, the larger the amount (and sizes) of images </strong>you will be able to upload for free, as outlined to the right. </p>
<p>Depending on the amount pledged, you will also be able to <strong>choose photo print(s) of greater size and quality.</strong></p>
<p>  For <strong>businesses</strong>, we offer the opportunity to exhibit <strong>business images and advertisements</strong> (<em>such as logos, product imagery, or promotional materials</em>) on our soon-to-be global platform. Pledging an amount equal to or over $250 will net you this benefit, <strong>allowing your business worldwide PR and advertising benefits-24/7.</strong></p>
<p>  Large pledges are considered<strong> priority investments </strong>and will ensure your<u> inclusion in the development of this marketplace innovation</u>, as well as the aforementioned incentives.

The Idea   Hi, I'm Kevin a software developer and founder of Tonkworks. I found the cost of touch screens for maker projects is way to high so I started hacking away at android tablets to make it easier to interact with all the stuff I end up making (robots, a thermostat, etc).  As the hardware parts for tablets become cheaper and cheaper- It makes more and more sense to use them as dedicated touchscreens for projects.The GoalThis campaign's goal is to get MakerTablets to as many developers as possible.

Help make things Interactive!Shipping is free in the U.S!A $10 international shipping fee applies.
Risks and Challenges:We plan to open source the templates for the Restaurant Menu, Paypal store kiosk, Motor control and Thermostat - but we will need a community to help answer questions and build on the platform to make it better.Forming a developer community around the MakerTablet will likely be the most difficult part of this campaign.",3.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<h2>Your Typing Solution</h2>
<p>The Minuum keyboard, through its simplicity, improves your touchscreen typing. Existing keyboards leave you barely enough screen to interact with your apps, and you can’t enjoy typing on them. Minuum eliminates the visual clutter of archaic mobile keyboards by adapting the keyboard to a single dimension. What enables this minimalism is our specialized auto-correction algorithm that allows highly imprecise typing. Your typing on mobile devices is inherently imprecise—and there’s nothing wrong with that. We work with that. By reducing the keyboard to a single dimension, Minuum opens up your touchscreen space for a variety of interaction possibilities—which allows for precision-entry.</p>
<h2><img alt=""Minuum on tablet"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://minuum.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/magnified.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h2>
<h2>Features at a Glance</h2>
<p>Minuum improves mobile typing by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recovering <em>more than half</em> of the usable touchscreen space you lose when you type on traditional virtual keyboards</li>
<li>Allowing you fast text entry when your typing is sloppy</li>
<li>Providing you with letter magnification for precise typing—especially useful if you have large fingers</li>
<li>Giving you the benefit of smart auto-correction</li>
<li>Respecting your familiarity with the QWERTY keyboard so you don’t have to re-learn the keyboard layout</li>
<li>Providing convenient access to everything you’d expect in a keyboard (such as, punctuation, space, backspace, and enter) without stealing your screen space</li>
<li>Letting you type anywhere—with a keyboard you can move around your touchscreen</li>
</ul><p>You will be able to customize the Minuum production release, with options such as: alternate colour schemes to match your smartphone case, curving keyboard layout for more ergonomic text entry, and the ability to rearrange the alphabet to your liking.</p>
<h3><img alt=""Minuum"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://minuum.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/minuum_hero_chat_fade2.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<h3>International Languages</h3>
<p>Minuum is extensible beyond the 26 characters of the English alphabet and can accommodate any language based on the Latin alphabet, plus punctuation, numbering, symbols, emoticons, or other inputs.</p>
<h2>Wearable Typing (and Prototyping) Is Here</h2>
<p>The Minuum layout is simply a continuum of letters, laid out in a row. We call it “one-dimensional” because it’s based on one row of keys. This frees up the keyboard to be anywhere you like on the screen, or even to curve for a more ergonomic keyboard shape. This arrangement <em>also </em>means you can type without needing complex sensors or flat surfaces, which means we can do away with large physical keyboards or touchscreens completely. If there is a place where you can measure one dimension of user input, Minuum will let you type there. This means being able to type practically anywhere, including with wearable technology.</p>
<p><img alt=""Wearable"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://minuum.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Minuum-Poster.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Going Beyond Your Touchscreen</h3>
<p>The simplest way to migrate Minuum from touchscreens and onto an edge, surface, or object is with a flexible resistive touch strip. You could then make a keyboard using common household supplies like graphite (from pencils), or sew the strip into fabric using conductive thread. As long as you can measure how far along the strip you are touching, Minuum will let you type fast and accurately without your needing to aim for letters precisely.</p>
<p>In fact, with Minuum you can even type without any surface at all, simply by measuring the orientation of your hand gestures in the air. You can do this in several ways, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>With an accelerometer/gyroscope in a ring, watch, armband, or handheld device</li>
<li>With a camera capturing the hand from something like a Kinect, Leap Motion Controller, or Google glasses.</li>
</ul><p>With only one dimension to measure, these kinds of typing systems are easy to make—and easy to use, even in noisy and constrained sensing environments.</p>
<h3>Extensibility</h3>
<p>You can incorporate Minuum into existing categories of devices to let people type anywhere. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Watches</strong>—A simple infrared or laser setup built into a watch, which measures where a someone’s finger breaks the beam, can allow wearers to type on their arms.</li>
<li>
<strong>Game controllers</strong>—These are notoriously painful to type with. You can use an analog stick to quickly type an e-mail using the Minuum layout, without needing to be precise.</li>
</ul><p>We have been prototyping and developing each of these Minuum applications mentioned above. If you are a developer of wearable tech devices, we'd love to <a href=""http://minuum.com/contact"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Contact Whirlscape"">hear from you</a> about how you'd like people to type with your device.</p>
<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<h3><strong>Accessibility</strong></h3>
<p>Minuum is accessible and, in different forms, can adapt to your typing needs. However tech-savvy you are, Minuum’s touchscreen keyboard can meet your text-entry style. Users with disabilities mark one end of the continuum, and we will be testing our technology on applications that allow us to serve them.</p>
<h2>Platform Support</h2>
<p>Google Android currently provides the most popular ecosystem that allows alternative virtual keyboards, so we will initially develop Minuum for availability to you through the Google Play Store.</p>
<p>Since Apple’s restrictions on iOS do not allow you to replace the default keyboard, we will make a Minuum version for iOS app developers to include in their software. Check out our <a href=""http://minuum.com/developers"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Developers"">developer support</a>.</p>
<p>We can also help others put who want to put Minuum on touchscreen devices using other operating systems (for example, Windows Phone, BlackBerry). Interested? <a href=""http://minuum.com/contact"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Contact Whirlscape"">Let us know</a>.</p>
<h2>iOS Developer Library</h2>
<p>You made your app look appealing. Why let the keyboard get in the way of that? We welcome iOS application developers implementing Minuum as their go-to typing method. Minuum is an ideal option wherever you show a lot of information or type a lot of text.</p>
<p>To help you develop Minuum-enabled apps, we will produce an iOS developer library, which you can license.</p>
<p><a href=""http://minuum.com/contact"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Contact Whirlscape"">Contact us</a> about licensing the Minuum iOS SDK to get started. If you want your keyboard to fit the look-and-feel of your app, <a href=""http://minuum.com/contact"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Contact Us"">let us know</a>!</p>
<h2>Progress So Far</h2>
<p>We have prototyped a Minuum app for iOS and have pivoted to developing an Android app. (See Platform Support, above, and Apple’s iOS app restrictions.) Right now we have a working prototype of the Android app.</p>
<h2>Development Roadmap</h2>
<p>Near-term projects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Android touchscreen Minuum keyboard beta release to our crowdfunding supporters two months after the end of our campaign</li>
<li>General Android Minuum keyboard beta release—prioritizing feature requests from our supporters—in Q1, 2014</li>
<li>Demo app and SDK for iOS in Q1, 2014</li>
</ul><p>As you can see, by supporting us you get access to our beta release at least two months before everyone else.</p>
<h3>Wearable Development Kit</h3>
<p>If we’re funded, you’ll be able to use an open Minuum wearable development kit (WDK) in about a year’s time. This will allow anyone—even non-specialists—to incorporate typing into everyday things. The Minuum project involves applying our virtual keyboard algorithms to other typing needs beyond touchscreens. Soon, you’ll be able to type quickly and accurately using a variety of wearable devices. Many of these haven’t been imagined yet, and our WDK will help you build those devices you dream of. Want to create a sweater that types or put a keyboard in your iPhone case? Using our WDK you’ll be able to connect to Android, iOS, Mac, or windows platforms and send the text you want.</p>

<h2>The Ask: How You Can Help</h2>
<p>If a future with wearable computing, as enabled by the Minuum project’s one-dimensional keyboard, looks astounding to you, it is. You can help us bring that future closer. We’ve received some seed funding through the <a href=""http://www.research.utoronto.ca/innovations-partnerships/commercialization-u-of-t/mars-innovation-ipo/utest/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""UTEST"">UTEST program</a> and from <a href=""http://marsinnovation.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""MaRS Innovation"">MaRS Innovation</a>, but we need your help.</p>
<p>We have a software developer we’d like to hire to produce the beta version on Minuum for Android—working under our guidance. We’re seeking $10,000 to help complete this development of a fully functional Android Minuum. That’s our campaign goal. We’re asking you to help us accomplish this.</p>
<h3>Bonus</h3>
<p>Beyond producing an Android Minuum beta, an additional $50,000 would help us produce an open wearable development kit (WDK) so we can enable you to start prototyping wearable typing devices. That’s our stretch goal. By helping us advance the Minuum project, you not only get our heartfelt thanks but also the satisfaction of championing some far-reaching technology—which is pretty cool.</p>
<h2>Backstory</h2>
<p>Minuum was inspired by a U of T research project: invent a better way of typing on touchscreen mobile phones without looking. This encouraged us to investigate various device-tilting techniques relying on user motion—which we understood to be useful in the field of wearable technology. The Minuum virtual keyboard for touchscreens is simply one extension of this approach. As a result of our research, we took the following steps to bring the technology to life:</p>
<ul>
<li>Designed a new alphabet layout</li>
<li>Developed the disambiguation algorithm</li>
<li>Ran user studies with various device-tilting techniques, finding that people could type at up to 37 words per minute, using carefully designed audio feedback, without any visual feedback or looking at their phones</li>
</ul><p>User motion, though imprecise, allowed us to type amazingly well. Since we realized our technology had uses beyond this cool new rotational text entry method, we pivoted to focus on creating a better touchscreen keypad. We founded Whirlscape to make this happen. All along we’ve been looking ahead to a new wave of typing with wearable technology. What we’ve created so far is much cooler than what we originally set out to do. We received some support for the Minuum project from <a href=""http://www.research.utoronto.ca/innovations-partnerships/commercialization-u-of-t/mars-innovation-ipo/utest/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""UTEST"">UTEST program</a> and <a href=""http://marsinnovation.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""MaRS Innovation"">MaRS Innovation</a> and now we need your help to take it even further.</p>

Your Typing Solution
The Minuum keyboard, through its simplicity, improves your touchscreen typing. Existing keyboards leave you barely enough screen to interact with your apps, and you can’t enjoy typing on them. Minuum eliminates the visual clutter of archaic mobile keyboards by adapting the keyboard to a single dimension. What enables this minimalism is our specialized auto-correction algorithm that allows highly imprecise typing. Your typing on mobile devices is inherently imprecise—and there’s nothing wrong with that. We work with that. By reducing the keyboard to a single dimension, Minuum opens up your touchscreen space for a variety of interaction possibilities—which allows for precision-entry.

Features at a Glance
Minuum improves mobile typing by:

Recovering more than half of the usable touchscreen space you lose when you type on traditional virtual keyboards

Respecting your familiarity with the QWERTY keyboard so you don’t have to re-learn the keyboard layout
Providing convenient access to everything you’d expect in a keyboard (such as, punctuation, space, backspace, and enter) without stealing your screen space
Letting you type anywhere—with a keyboard you can move around your touchscreen
You will be able to customize the Minuum production release, with options such as: alternate colour schemes to match your smartphone case, curving keyboard layout for more ergonomic text entry, and the ability to rearrange the alphabet to your liking.

However, having to use the front of the phone means holding the device at uncomfortable angles, and because we cannot see the screen getting a proper scan is very difficult. </p><h2>Introducing the ScanMira</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614610485/tcwidj2btakczeqzc4rd.png"" src=""""/></p><p> We created the ScanMira! A simple iPhone and iPad compatible accessory for making it easier to get amazing scans using the FaceID feature.</p><h3>How to Use:</h3><ul>
<li>Slide the ScanMira onto your iPhone or iPad </li>
<li>Open your favorite 3D Scanning App </li>
<li>Scan with ease! </li>

<p>Simply watch the screen while you scan to avoid missing sections and to ensure you capture every angle of your object for the perfect scan.</p>
<h3>Scanning without VS with ScanMira</h3>
<p>Scanning without seeing the screen of your phone can leave holes in your scans, meaning multiple tries are needed to get the perfect scan, but with ScanMira you can get the perfect scan before your eyes.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614611056/uakttvqynfrxf56tyj4m.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>We wanted to make sure that scanning with the ScanMira would have no negative effects on your scans, so we opted to use a First Surface Mirror, which reflects clearer images than the average mirror you can get at the store.</p>

<p>We recommend EM3D as a 3D scanning app. Please download it from the App Store on your compatible iPhone or iPad!</p>
<p>With or without a case you can easily make 3D scans with any of the listed Apple Products! Scan and share with your friends as simple as sending a text.  </p>

</div></div>","Creating a fully colored 3D model by simply scanning an object with an iPhone was an amazing experience, one of those moments that really grounds you in the reality of how far technology has come, but in that same vein, it can also always be improved.We found that, in order to get the highest quality complex and detailed scans that we could, it was pertinent that we use the FaceID feature of the iPhone while scanning. However, having to use the front of the phone means holding the device at uncomfortable angles, and because we cannot see the screen getting a proper scan is very difficult. Introducing the ScanMira We created the ScanMira! A simple iPhone and iPad compatible accessory for making it easier to get amazing scans using the FaceID feature.How to Use:
Slide the ScanMira onto your iPhone or iPad 
Open your favorite 3D Scanning App 
Scan with ease! 
 ScanMira: 
Simply watch the screen while you scan to avoid missing sections and to ensure you capture every angle of your object for the perfect scan.
Scanning without VS with ScanMira
Scanning without seeing the screen of your phone can leave holes in your scans, meaning multiple tries are needed to get the perfect scan, but with ScanMira you can get the perfect scan before your eyes.


We wanted to make sure that scanning with the ScanMira would have no negative effects on your scans, so we opted to use a First Surface Mirror, which reflects clearer images than the average mirror you can get at the store.

Compatible Devices

 Recommended Scanning Apps:

We recommend EM3D as a 3D scanning app. Please download it from the App Store on your compatible iPhone or iPad!
With or without a case you can easily make 3D scans with any of the listed Apple Products! Scan and share with your friends as simple as sending a text.  
Join the VR, AR, or 3D Printing revolution. With 3D scanning, you can make Snapchat Lenses, Create AR pictures, or even use a 3D Printer to make physical 3D copies of your favorite objects. The Full Scanning Process:

<p><b>Design &amp; Production</b></p>
<p>When first creating the 
LVO backpack we started with a simple hand drawn design. This snowballed
 into a complete backpack after a lot of trial and error. We came up 
with our design by basing our backpack off different features we 
considered stylish on the backpacks we liked. With the style part down, 
we studied different backpacks and which features we felt were necessary
 and which features were just a waste of space. This helped us design a 
backpack that is very user friendly. With a very practical design on 
paper, we then met with a sewing company in San Diego, California. After
 many meetings and altering our design we finally came up with our 
prototype. We ran a few test trials by using the backpack in normal 
situations. We gathered notes on which features needed improving. Now 
the final product of the LVO backpack is done and with your help we'll 
be able to get the most practical and biggest bang for your buck for a 
backpack on the market. <br/></p>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
<p>Hi, my name is Steve Tuthill.  I am overseeing the development of TapURit; and I have been involved in software development for many years.  I find that mobile media is both exciting to develop and fun to use.  The notion of sharing fun times, thoughts, and opinions is more convenient than in the past and immediate as well. </p>
<p>A few of us were planning a party – thus the comments in the movie – and were looking for an easy way to send invitations, provide maps, and have an event recap that we could easily send to our friends.  It seemed that we needed to use more than one application to complete the tasks.  There had to be a better way.</p>
<p>I value innovation in my software designs and projects.  From ease of use, to interesting interfaces, to actually being practical TapURit is an app that most everyone can find a use.  Thank you for checking us out in this venue; and I hope you will join us to enable the successful creation of TapURit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are looking for $40,000 for the TapURit application development costs.</p>
 
<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
<p>TapURit is a template-based multimedia application for invitations, event recaps, and announcements, using Navatars, sounds, and easy sharing among groups and across platforms.</p>
<p>TapURit is an easy to use drag and drop app that enables users to enter text, photos, sounds, and movies in a variety of templates. </p>
<p>Outputs from the application are easily shared on social media sites as well as proximity sharing with friends.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Story: </strong></p>
<p>Whether planning a large party, sending graduation announcements, or determining interest for an event, there are limited choices that are fun to use, easy to learn, easy to share, and have all-encompassing functions for a range of interests.  So, we set out to build something with a unique interface with sound effects when the system sends or receives Taps.  The more we looked into the possibilities, the more excited we became for the opportunity.  As a result, we created the little movie using characters that illustrate what we are intending to move from prototype to products. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Specs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Work cross platform for iPad, iPhone, and Android devices</li>
<li>Enable templates for a variety of uses – invitations, recaps, notices and others</li>
<li>Upload text, images, audio, and video</li>
<li>Distribute output with email, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, blogs, etc.</li>
<li>Proximity sharing made easy</li>
<li>Create a variety of Navatars, sounds, and templates</li>
<li>Focus on functionality</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Navatars:</strong></p>
<p>Navatars are our navigational avatars.  Each has its own personality.  Each has its own music and characteristics unique to navigational systems to date.  They are usually cooperative to what you ask them to do, but perhaps, sometimes not. </p>

<p> </p></div>","Introduction:
Hi, my name is Steve Tuthill.  I am overseeing the development of TapURit; and I have been involved in software development for many years.  I find that mobile media is both exciting to develop and fun to use.  The notion of sharing fun times, thoughts, and opinions is more convenient than in the past and immediate as well. 
A few of us were planning a party – thus the comments in the movie – and were looking for an easy way to send invitations, provide maps, and have an event recap that we could easily send to our friends.  It seemed that we needed to use more than one application to complete the tasks.  There had to be a better way.
I value innovation in my software designs and projects.  From ease of use, to interesting interfaces, to actually being practical TapURit is an app that most everyone can find a use.  Thank you for checking us out in this venue; and I hope you will join us to enable the successful creation of TapURit.
 
We are looking for $40,000 for the TapURit application development costs.
 
Overview:
TapURit is a template-based multimedia application for invitations, event recaps, and announcements, using Navatars, sounds, and easy sharing among groups and across platforms.
TapURit is an easy to use drag and drop app that enables users to enter text, photos, sounds, and movies in a variety of templates. 
Outputs from the application are easily shared on social media sites as well as proximity sharing with friends.
 
The Story: 
Whether planning a large party, sending graduation announcements, or determining interest for an event, there are limited choices that are fun to use, easy to learn, easy to share, and have all-encompassing functions for a range of interests.  So, we set out to build something with a unique interface with sound effects when the system sends or receives Taps.  The more we looked into the possibilities, the more excited we became for the opportunity.  As a result, we created the little movie using characters that illustrate what we are intending to move from prototype to products. 
 
The Specs:

Work cross platform for iPad, iPhone, and Android devices
Enable templates for a variety of uses – invitations, recaps, notices and others
Upload text, images, audio, and video
Distribute output with email, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, blogs, etc.
Proximity sharing made easy
Create a variety of Navatars, sounds, and templates
Focus on functionality

 
Navatars:
Navatars are our navigational avatars.  Each has its own personality.  Each has its own music and characteristics unique to navigational systems to date.  They are usually cooperative to what you ask them to do, but perhaps, sometimes not.

<p>   Welcome to the PayCase product launch
page! What is PayCase you ask, and why do I need it? Before I go into
detail with that, let me explain a little about the technology that
goes into PayCase.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.rfid-nfc.eu/what-is-nfc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.rfid-nfc.eu/what-is-nfc</a>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>    PayCase is built around a technology
called NFC or Near Field Communications. NFC is a form of RFID or
Radio Frequency ID and is not a new technology, in fact chances are
you have several RFID chips on you right now! RFID has been used as a
security measure for everything from access cards for Government
agencies and apartment buildings to rapid pairing of smart devices through Bluetooth and WiFi. The thing is,
these chips are not near as “Secure” as they claim to be. Check this news clip out.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.news9.com/story/22277092/thieves-using-high-tech-device-to-steal-credit-card-information?autoStart=true&amp;topVideoCatNo=default&amp;clipId=8888965"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.news9.com/story/22277092/thieves-using-high-tech-device-to-steal-credit-card-information?autoStart=true&amp;topVideoCatNo=default&amp;clipId=8888965</a></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>     Do I have your attention yet? So with
companies pouring billions of dollars into expanding
touch-less NFC pay-points, how do we protect ourselves when banks are
putting these chips into our credit and debit cards more often then
not? Go back to using just cash? Or even worse, checks? Do we go with
evolution or skip to revolution?</p>
<p><a href=""http://bgr.com/2011/08/29/verizon-t-mobile-and-at-prepare-mobile-payment-battle-with-google/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">http://bgr.com/2011/08/29/verizon-t-mobile-and-at-prepare-mobile-payment-battle-with-google/</a><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">    We put science and ingenuity on our
side with the simple yet revolutionary PayCase.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>    PayCase is a case, form fitted for
your mobile phone (Currently available for the iPhone 4/4s/5/5s and Samsung Galaxy S3/S4), that allows you all the convenience of using your
bank cards with a fraction of the risk. PayCase protects your
information in the most simple way possible, physically. PayCase does this by incorporating a radio
wave blocking material into the casing around the NFC chip. The
advantage to this approach is that unless you have your phone in your
hand and depressing the button, no radio waves can pass through
therefore eliminating the risk of virtual pick-pocketers.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>    As simple as it works, it is just as
simple to activate. When you purchase PayCase in a retail location
there will be serial numbers printed on the inner edge of the case. With
these unique serial numbers you can go online to a secure site such
as PayPal or Google wallet and link the serial number with your bank
card. So when you go to pay at a NFC capable POS station the serial
number will be transmitted to the correct payment processing site and
your bank card will be charged. If your case is lost or stolen you can
easily unlink your case with your cards from any internet connected
computer or smart device. Even if someone manages to get something in
before you unlink, your banks fraud protection will still protect you
AND you will still have your physical card to get you by until you
purchase a new PayCase.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>	In our world of high tech gadgetry,
social networks, fashion, instant sharing and online shopping you
have to be vigilant with your privacy  and looks, and PayCase aims to please on both fronts.
Initially PayCase will be offered in two models, the 2S and 4S (referring to the amount of NFC chips built in), each with one pocket
for a Government issued ID and available in three colors (black,
white and pink).</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>     The technical specs are done, a prototype has been made, and we
have a local Colorado manufacturer ready to produce, all we need is
enough to meet the minimum purchase order of $25,000. I have raised
some money already but I need YOU to put this over the top! Be ready
for revolution support PayCase today! </p>

companies pouring billions of dollars into expanding
touch-less NFC pay-points, how do we protect ourselves when banks are
putting these chips into our credit and debit cards more often then
not? Go back to using just cash? Or even worse, checks? Do we go with
evolution or skip to revolution?
http://bgr.com/2011/08/29/verizon-t-mobile-and-at-prepare-mobile-payment-battle-with-google/ 
    We put science and ingenuity on our
side with the simple yet revolutionary PayCase.


    PayCase is a case, form fitted for
your mobile phone (Currently available for the iPhone 4/4s/5/5s and Samsung Galaxy S3/S4), that allows you all the convenience of using your
bank cards with a fraction of the risk. PayCase protects your
information in the most simple way possible, physically. PayCase does this by incorporating a radio
wave blocking material into the casing around the NFC chip. The
advantage to this approach is that unless you have your phone in your
hand and depressing the button, no radio waves can pass through
therefore eliminating the risk of virtual pick-pocketers.


    As simple as it works, it is just as
simple to activate. When you purchase PayCase in a retail location
there will be serial numbers printed on the inner edge of the case. With
these unique serial numbers you can go online to a secure site such
as PayPal or Google wallet and link the serial number with your bank
card. So when you go to pay at a NFC capable POS station the serial
number will be transmitted to the correct payment processing site and
your bank card will be charged. If your case is lost or stolen you can
easily unlink your case with your cards from any internet connected
computer or smart device. Even if someone manages to get something in
before you unlink, your banks fraud protection will still protect you
AND you will still have your physical card to get you by until you
purchase a new PayCase.


	In our world of high tech gadgetry,
social networks, fashion, instant sharing and online shopping you
have to be vigilant with your privacy  and looks, and PayCase aims to please on both fronts.
Initially PayCase will be offered in two models, the 2S and 4S (referring to the amount of NFC chips built in), each with one pocket
for a Government issued ID and available in three colors (black,
white and pink).


     The technical specs are done, a prototype has been made, and we
have a local Colorado manufacturer ready to produce, all we need is
enough to meet the minimum purchase order of $25,000. I have raised
some money already but I need YOU to put this over the top! Be ready
for revolution support PayCase today!

The Risks and challenges:

The next steps are for the continuation of development, the manufacture for the fulfillment of a 14 year dream. we know that before production begins, we may encounter some problems. We have contingency plans in place to mitigate the risks and we have enlisted great advisors to supply solutions.
Software:
The software and app are still in development and we have work to do building the features that we need to include in the RedBox_G73 app. Software development sometimes gets tricky and takes longer than expected, but we have experienced project management and if necessary will look for additional assistance to solve and issues that could emerge.
Manufacturing:
We will undoubtedly have some surprises on our journey, but we have faith in the team and the wisdom to overcome all challengers. Our goal is to make the best possible product for you and deliver it right on time!
We have a plan:




                              Help make it happen!

<h2><strong>Hello world:</strong></h2>
<h3>Welcome to my indiegogo page.  My name is Joseph Sambriski and I am seeking funding for ""DeviceRak"", my patent-pending product.  I have tested the prototype model that you see in the pictures and video and am ready to have it manufactured.</h3>
<h2><strong>Production plan:  </strong></h2>
<h3>The purpose of the funds is to assist in covering the cost of fabricating a plastic injection mould so that the DeviceRak can be manufactured cost effectively.</h3>
<h3>Currently I have a manufacturer here in New York so if the funding goal is not met I can still have the DeviceRak made at a higher cost per unit. </h3>
<h2><strong>What is the DeviceRak? </strong></h2>
<h3>The DeviceRak is a convenient way to store your devices while they charge and/or when not in use.  I have tried to find an inexpensive yet quality way to charge my iPhone and my iPod Touch and found that <strong>there is no product on the market made to hold more than one device.</strong>
</h3>
<h3>Most of the time we all leave our device on a nightstand, a table, or kitchen countertop while charging it which takes up space and has the possibility of being knocked to the floor or having something spilled on it and getting damaged.  Others leave their devices on the floor near the outlet but why risk having it getting stepped on or kicked.</h3>
<h3>The DeviceRak fits 2 devices; namely the iPhone, iPad, iPad mini, iPod Touch, Nook, Kindle, Droid, Samsung &amp; Blackberry phones, etc.</h3>
<h2><strong>How does it work?  </strong></h2>
<h3>The 3M Command strips are adhered to the back of the DeviceRak so just peel and press to the wall. There are no tools needed for installation and the DeviceRak can easily be removed without damage to the wall and used in another location.</h3>
<h2>
<strong>A little about me:</strong>  </h2>
<h3>I am a former assistant golf teaching professional and I lost my job in 2009 due to a bad economy.  I started my own company when I came up with an educational math board game called Diceathon which is selling to schools across the country.  I am now focusing on this new project which I know will succeed with your help.</h3>

We are excited to be featured on BackerClub.co this week! They are the top community for people who love crowdfunding and back a ton of projects and we are really looking forward to the feedback and hope you like it too!



This is K Kit
K Kit is a small, customizable, modular smart home system that you can control from your smart phone. You will improve your family's quality of life with a smarter home.For the first time, K Kit has integrated existing smart home features into an easily installed, unobtrusive and intuitive package. It includes basic convenience, security and efficiency features, one-touch preset “themes” as well as infinite potential for customization. You choose how much you want to geek out with K Kit.





Magic happens when the modules work together!






So long as the sensors and linked devices are in range of the hub, they can be networked to deliver you information remotely and control all the electronic features of your home. You can personalize your own unique triggers and custom settings based on your habits and devices.The possibilities are limitless！



The RF remote control will open the electronic curtain every morning for you. Imagine slowly illuminating your room with soft, natural sunlight at 7am instead of an obnoxious alarm clock.




You don't need to rush out of the door early in the morning anymore!  K Kit will turn off devices for energy conservation, open/shut the garage, activate the security system, and you are ready to go.




K Kit will instantly alert you to any unexpected visitors and activities, so you can monitor and secure your home from anywhere.



The temperature sensor detects the environment and triggers the IR remote control to turn on the A/C automatically.  Your home will be a comfortably balanced ecosystem.


Now you can command all of the devices in your home from one single app! You can control them when you are away, or let devices work at preset times. It's an All-In-One Remote Control In Your Pocket!




The motion-activated night light will be engaged in your favorite shade of pink or blue and light up your way when you wake up in the midnight.



Beautiful design for a beautiful home



We developed K Kit according to our customer-first philosophy. K Kit is designed to be a modular and flexible smart home system that seamlessly blends into anyone’s home(no matter if it is a  house or apartment) and lifestyle. Each piece of the K Kit exponentially increases the potential smart home functions, but without any sacrifice to the user-friendliness of the whole. We believe the beauty of the product is a natural byproduct of its simplicity and possibility.

<p>JmGO View is a LED projector, so it is more energy-efficient and requires less lumens than a traditional light to produce the same effect. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">With 30,000 hours life span  - that's 10 years even if you use it for 8 hours per day! No lamp replacement is required and it's eco-friendly. At 250 lumens, the light is more than enough to produce a vivid and clear picture even when there is some light in the room. We recommend a distance of 2.5 - 3.5M, with projection size 80-100"" for the best effect.</span></p>

Our suppliers could let us down. If we're lucky, we might get excess demand for this product, meaning it will take our factories longer to produce them all. Our software may need more time than expected for us to debug and fix. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">However, whatever challenges we meet, we will definitely keep you posted so you're not left hanging.</span></p>

The portability of JmGO View unlocks possibilities that will change the way you watch the things you love. 

Thank you for helping us reach our goal so quickly! We've introduced Stretch Goals which some of YOU have mentioned that you'd like to see. Please help us reach our goals by sharing this campaign with friends and family, so that these Stretch Goals can be unlocked for everyone.

Taking the fun outside:Check out our Gallery for more photos and videos!




















Here's a sneak peek of our product at CES this January. That was our first prototype version, and we're constantly improving it based on all of the fantastic feedback we're getting from you!


In simple terms, JmGO View is a smart portable projector. But it's a lot more than that. Intricately designed with a gorgeous full metal-casing, this DLP projector offers advanced 3D technology, a powerful Android OS, with both Android & iOS compatibility, industry-leading Texas Instruments optical technology, topped with cinema quality projection and sound. With its built-in battery, it is a portable entertainment portal that you can take with you anywhere.




Connect your USB drive or access Dropbox online to share your work with the people who matter. At only 1KG, you can take JmGO View with you anywhere, without the hassle of wires.


Project onto any white flat surface and watch your favourite movies in widescreen HD. Put on the JmGO Active 3D Glasses for an even more immersive experience.


Experience advanced surround sound audio with the built-in Dolby Digital Plus speakers to get cinema-style audio at home. You can even use JmGO View as just a Bluetooth Speaker.



Control with Apple or Android to view your favourite shows.





Use it to play the latest video games on a cinema-size screen. Now you can invite your friends over to play.




We built JmGO View to be smart. Plug n' play set up, one button on/off, built-in battery, easy smartphone control, WIFI/Bluetooth friendly. 





With HDMI, you can connect to your laptop, PC or even your TV for seamless video transmission. The USB port allows you to access your documents in your memory stick conveniently. With Miracast, you can wirelessly mirror what's showing on your Android device. Happycast (similar idea to Airplay) is also available for iOS users.

 
JmGO View is a LED projector, so it is more energy-efficient and requires less lumens than a traditional light to produce the same effect. With 30,000 hours life span  - that's 10 years even if you use it for 8 hours per day! No lamp replacement is required and it's eco-friendly. At 250 lumens, the light is more than enough to produce a vivid and clear picture even when there is some light in the room. We recommend a distance of 2.5 - 3.5M, with projection size 80-100"" for the best effect.






JmGO View supports dual-band WiFi (2.4G/5G), which means whether you're streaming a 3D movie or game that requires extra bandwidth, you can expect faster and a more stable performance with the View.


















Wrap your JmGO View in the safety of this leather Travel Case. Made of top quality ABS + PU leather with a soft microfibre sleeve, this travel case gives you a rigid and tough base to protect the lens from any scratches or bumps. It's also water, stain and abrasion-resistant to fully protect your JmGO View from every side. When not in use, you can collapse and fold it away.
See more photos in our Gallery.





















Interested in Distributing?
We've received interest from distributors all around the world and we are happy to discuss with you. Please drop us a message at: contact@jmgo.com
Product Warranty
We are confident in our products. However, in the unlikely circumstance where a JmGO View has a glitch, every unit comes with a 1 year warranty.






Please note that the final specifications can change, due to refinements made to improve the device.



How does JmGO View compare with similar projectors?

































Our mission is to create Smart Home Theaters that are powerful, but small and beautiful. And so we built the G1 Smart Home Theater in 2014 - and boy, was it a success. Then we thought, what if we built something that is like the G1 in capability, but is also portable? This year we are introducing JmGO View - our newest, smartest and most beautiful Smart Portable Projector yet. 
We can't wait for you to receive one, turn it on, and be amazed. We hope you will love it as much as we do. 




We need your support and we're not just saying it. We've spent countless nights developing and designing JmGO View, but it cannot become a reality without your support. For us to be able to further develop this product, build the international firmware, and mass produce, we will need funding. More importantly, we want this product to reach everyone. From education to quality family time, to backpackers on an adventure, we want the JmGO View to be part of your journey. If you think our product will benefit someone that you know, please help us to spread the message.




We want to ensure that whatever we send to our supporters is flawless and timely. But lets be honest, despite our experience, there are various risks to this project. Our suppliers could let us down. If we're lucky, we might get excess demand for this product, meaning it will take our factories longer to produce them all. Our software may need more time than expected for us to debug and fix. However, whatever challenges we meet, we will definitely keep you posted so you're not left hanging.

<p><b>What is the Umii iUpgrade </b></p>
<p>When
you're on the go - camping, traveling, sporting events, or festivals - there
are times you have tried to take great photos and videos to share with your friends.
But what happens when you're out of space and don't have access to the cloud
for back up storage? What if you want to keep your data local to avoid hitting bandwidth limitations (meaning extra cost) and privacy reasons?</p>
<p> This
is where the Umii iUpgrade case comes in to save the day. The <i>Umii iUpgrade will give your iPhone a secondary
storage drive from 16GB up to 200GB without carrying something extra. </i></p>
<p>The iUpgrade also comes with an app that you
can use to stream movies/photos from your phone to Apple TV or even Google's
Chromecast, </p>
<p>The iUpgrade is not just a slim bumper case with additional storage;
it also acts as a signal booster offering 15-20% increased reception, meaning
you never have to worry about dropped calls again.</p>
<p>With the UmiiSoft app you can instantly back
up your files even when you don't have internet access to your cloud back-up
systems or iTunes. The app also allows you to quickly copy files when your
device's memory storage reaches max capacity with 1 click of a button.</p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i><b>Our prototype unit is using certified an Apple lightning connector, but we are applying to be MFI approved. Our goal and wish is to have our product approved by Apple and be sold in their retail spaces.</b></i></p>

<h3>70 Million Users - How Many Want More Storage?</h3>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430645694/rbdrru2dlqrhjjkbfdj1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<p>With over
70 million iPhone 6’s available worldwide, 2/5 of smartphone users in the USA
and 3/7 of smartphone users in UK are using the iPhone as their go-to
connectivity platform.We see the majority
of these users are also experiencing storage limitations as 4K video and HD
images begin to grow in availability. Why not be able to maximize the latest in
your camera hardware and never worry about remote storage?</p>
<p>Most first time iPhone buyers end up with the 16GB model and regret not obtaining more space. The iUpgrade Case removes those restrictions and lets you take control back of your phone's hardware.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>We designed
the <b>Umii iUpgrade Case</b> for the
mobile gamer, the budding filmmaker, or even users who just prefer to have
their files on their phone rather than on the cloud. Our focus on quality and
innovation is what helped drive the slim-line development and now we are ready
to share our passion with you. As the world continues to stay in touch through
connected devices, we also understand the need for a non-bulky unit to ensure
total comfort and maintain the unique aesthetics of the iPhone that we have all
known and grown to appreciate. </p>
<p>The <b>Umii iUpgrade Case</b> utilizes a highly
durable aluminum exterior to protect your iPhone 6 from drops and includes an Apple
certified lightning chip, meaning you never have to worry about future iOS
updates having issues with the storage functionality. This same chip converts
the case to a more accessible micro-USB connection for easier use and allows
for access with Qi wireless chargers. This ensures that our users will have a
worry-free experience with all the accessibility at their fingertips. On top of
the durability, the casing has the ability to protect the protruding iPhone
camera lens by an additional 2mm when placed on flat surfaces.</p>

<p>The Umii iUpgrade

Prefer to watch it in your living room? The added support for Apple Play and
ChromeCast means your iPhone 6 is the ultimate portable multimedia device and
utilizes the most popular ways to broadcast.</p>

fastest growing platform) will see tremendous benefits from added storage space
with high-res graphics to support the Retina HD screen resolutions.</span></span><br/></p>

Solving iPhone 6's Storage Problems w/o Sacrificing the Slim, Elegant Design 
Have you ever had to delete photos or
videos because you needed more storage?
Ever worry about if you have
enough storage when taking a videos?
Did you ever have to delete files just to
update the new Apple iOS on your iPhone? 
Ever wish you selected a larger iPhone 6 size from the get-go?
If you said ""YES"" to any of the questions above then the Umii iUpgrade drive case will solve your problems!  






What is the Umii iUpgrade 
When
you're on the go - camping, traveling, sporting events, or festivals - there
are times you have tried to take great photos and videos to share with your friends.
But what happens when you're out of space and don't have access to the cloud
for back up storage? What if you want to keep your data local to avoid hitting bandwidth limitations (meaning extra cost) and privacy reasons?
 This
is where the Umii iUpgrade case comes in to save the day. The Umii iUpgrade will give your iPhone a secondary
storage drive from 16GB up to 200GB without carrying something extra. 
The iUpgrade also comes with an app that you
can use to stream movies/photos from your phone to Apple TV or even Google's
Chromecast, 
The iUpgrade is not just a slim bumper case with additional storage;
it also acts as a signal booster offering 15-20% increased reception, meaning
you never have to worry about dropped calls again.
With the UmiiSoft app you can instantly back
up your files even when you don't have internet access to your cloud back-up
systems or iTunes. The app also allows you to quickly copy files when your
device's memory storage reaches max capacity with 1 click of a button.

Our prototype unit is using certified an Apple lightning connector, but we are applying to be MFI approved. Our goal and wish is to have our product approved by Apple and be sold in their retail spaces.

Slimmest Drive Case for iPhone 6 with “Max 328GB drive(128GB+200GB)” – the Umii

Details Matter

We designed the Umii drive case so that any of your audio devices work flawlessely without the need for adapters or extra cables. Just plug and play your favorite auxiliary devices for full-bodied sound and recording capabilities.
What We Offer
The iPhone was designed to be slim and elegant - let's keep it that way!

Side by side comparison of the phone with and without the case. The iUpgrade maintains the slim exterior design of the iPhone while providing many benefits.
Slim Design

Avoid bulky cases and keep your phone secure in any style of clothing - from jeans to business wear.

Designed for the Worry-less Traveler


No matter where you are traveling - by plane, train, or automobile - the iUpgrade case also includes 2 additional credit card sized power banks for a total of 16-20 hours of use for your iPhone. Utilize the iUpgrade's storage space to watch HD movies or play the latest games to keep you entertained for hours on end.
Important Files? Always Have Them Available!






Perfect for students or business users, the iUpgrade case comes with a charge-and-sync adapter key. Forget bringing a cable that could potentially fray or break.
The Umii iUpgrade Case can also function as a USB storage device and includes support for Micro SD cards to upgrade your device to the latest storage space available. Only with the Umii iUpgrade Case can you obtain 200+128GB storage!
2-way Functionality - use the Umii iUpgrade case as a portable USB storage device with and with out itune
While the cloud is always a great way to back-up your files, the speed and accessibility of remote storage allows users to control content within seconds. The Umii iUpgrade aims to fulfill that need for users who may not have access to high-speed internet at all times - including on planes or in rural areas.
UmiiSoft Keeps You Up-To-Date 



Simplify your life with the UmiiSoft mobile application which includes 1-click transfers. Don't want to have to pick what videos or photos to delete? Your selected storage model gives you the freedom and flexibilityto keep it all and avoid slowing down your phone.

UmiiSoft App - ChromeCast Support

UmiiSoft also includes ChromeCast streaming for all supported audio/photo/video formats to make your iPhone a multimedia device that goes where you go.
HD Video Recording




Did you know HD video record takes about 1GB of space for 5 minutes of footage?
With the Umii iUpgrade Case, record all of your moments in HD and don't miss a single detail - your son's football game, your favorite concert, sporting event, or even a party. 
This isn't just a great personal use, but can even be useful for business professionals looking to record conferences, training sessions, and trade shows.

An Image Is Still Worth A Thousand Words


The iPhone supports poster size HD photos, so you can cherish those moments and keep them forever. However, as resolution sizes increase, so does the size of the images. The iUpgrade case alleviates those worries and allows you to keep all your photos in HD - whether you're an amateur or pro.


What We Need & What You Get Perks


A majority of the iUpgrade investment has been completed on our end. We need your support for the mass production and to get ahead of the curve and help us continue our dream of being technology innovators.





Select your model based on your size.



Example: If you have a 16GB phone and you want to get to get the Umii iUpgrade 200GB model, your maximum total storage will be 216GB!

We have multiple packages to provide as benefits to you:


Family Pack (Pair) - Get an iUpgrade case for you and a loved one for a discounted price.
Super Early Bird Special - Get access to special pricing for first 900 units

•  The Umii iUpgrade Case is designed and assembled in the United States
•  The Umii iUpgrade Case will be shipped from Los Angeles, California

Bonus IndieGogo Upgrade Package
As a testament to our passion for innovation and sharing our unique technology, Umii will also offer future upgradability for new and existing customers.
When you purchase a Umii iUpgrade Case through this indiegogo campaign, you will be added to a unique buyer list that will have access to upgrade your case to ANY new iteration in the future for a simple $50 exchange fee and the original case. We'll cover shipping both ways.



What this means – Here’s an example:
You buy a Umii iUpgrade case from this indiegogo page for the iPhone 6 and we later launch an iPad, iPhone 6 Plus, or even an iPhone 7 model - you only have to pay $50 and send in your existing case. You keep your Micro SD card and all of your content. We'll then ship you a new case which you can plug your card back in and enjoy content without restrictions.
This upgrade offer provides a lifetime of upgradability for any Apple iPhone or iPad models. This is just our way of saying thank you for your support and helping us achieve our dream.   The Impact 
70 Million Users - How Many Want More Storage?

With over
70 million iPhone 6’s available worldwide, 2/5 of smartphone users in the USA
and 3/7 of smartphone users in UK are using the iPhone as their go-to
connectivity platform.We see the majority
of these users are also experiencing storage limitations as 4K video and HD
images begin to grow in availability. Why not be able to maximize the latest in
your camera hardware and never worry about remote storage?
Most first time iPhone buyers end up with the 16GB model and regret not obtaining more space. The iUpgrade Case removes those restrictions and lets you take control back of your phone's hardware.
Genuine Slim Design


We designed
the Umii iUpgrade Case for the
mobile gamer, the budding filmmaker, or even users who just prefer to have
their files on their phone rather than on the cloud. Our focus on quality and
innovation is what helped drive the slim-line development and now we are ready
to share our passion with you. As the world continues to stay in touch through
connected devices, we also understand the need for a non-bulky unit to ensure
total comfort and maintain the unique aesthetics of the iPhone that we have all
known and grown to appreciate. 
The Umii iUpgrade Case utilizes a highly
durable aluminum exterior to protect your iPhone 6 from drops and includes an Apple
certified lightning chip, meaning you never have to worry about future iOS
updates having issues with the storage functionality. This same chip converts
the case to a more accessible micro-USB connection for easier use and allows
for access with Qi wireless chargers. This ensures that our users will have a
worry-free experience with all the accessibility at their fingertips. On top of
the durability, the casing has the ability to protect the protruding iPhone
camera lens by an additional 2mm when placed on flat surfaces.


The Umii iUpgrade
Case even amplifies sound quality – bringing full, clean sound to your media.
Prefer to watch it in your living room? The added support for Apple Play and
ChromeCast means your iPhone 6 is the ultimate portable multimedia device and
utilizes the most popular ways to broadcast.
Take Control of
Your Phone
The Good & Bad News for iPhone users


As the
application technology of the ever-popular iPhone increases, so does the
requirement of storage. Recent announcements include that applications are
increasing in size from 2GB to 4GB – ¼ of the storage space for the most sold
iPhone 6 model.  Mobile gaming (the
fastest growing platform) will see tremendous benefits from added storage space
with high-res graphics to support the Retina HD screen resolutions.


Even if
you’re not a gamer, the latest iOS 8 release also clocked in at around 1/5th
of space. Why worry about deleting files to update your phone for the latest
features? 




Future film
makers utilizing the hi-res 8MP HD camera on the iPhone 6 allows remote storage
of slow-motion videos without worry of limitation. The Umii iUpgrade case design
allows you to avoid having to slowly upload large hi-res videos to the cloud
and clear up storage space for those long filming sessions.

Patented Signal
Booster and Wireless Charging
The Umii iUpgrade case was designed to expand the limitations of
your iPhone and includes a patented chip to expand your phone and Wi-Fi signal
for cleaner signals when transferring files to and from the phone.
Add-On (QI Charger Pad with adapter)


Also included is the Qi charging capability so that as
wireless power technology develops, you are up-to-speed with the latest
offerings. Simply place your phone within range of any Qi-enabled charger and
your Umii iUpgrade case will restore your iPhone’s battery easily and efficiently.

Risks & Challenges

As a truly innovative hardware and software company, we understand the needs of all types of individuals - including those who are busy (like us!) and want to have content at their fingertips whenever they need. With the ability to watch and play at our leisure, the Umii iUpgrade case removes the limitations of storage and opens up your mobile life for all possibilities. Come help us drive innovation and introduce a new era of content creation for developers and mobile video entertainment.

 Many crowdsourced projects begin asking for support without fully realizing the ability to make it a real product. We take that worry out of the equation. 
We already have a working product, but just need the support for mass production. Check out some photos of the product and also our 3D design model.


Real, Unedited Product Photo



We offer full transparency. by providing insight into the risks and obstacles we may face on the way to achieving our goal.
As we are commited to meeting all deadlines, we believe our factory will begin production by the end of June and we will be shipping out all our product by mid Aug 2015.  
Each supporter will also receive the contact information of our CEO, Tony Nguyen, who will personally attend to any questions or issues that may arise. We want to not only provide the best product, but also back it up with our service guarantee.
Our Timeline:
May 3: Indiegogo start
Middle June: Follow up with factory to prepare every unit for production,
End of June: Production starts,
Middle of Aug: We will start to ship out all Perks 
Even after we ship out all ours perks, we won't just stop there. We are constantly trying to impove ways to increasee our Umii iUpgrade drive with apps and support for new technologies like wireless charging capabilities, 
For example, our plan for version 2 will have the umii iUpgrade case offer direct phone to phone transfer with out network or cable needed, This will be great if you're out with your friends and family and want to share a large video content but don't have a data connection.    Other Ways You Can Help Even if you can't contribute due to monetary constraints (or if you're an Android user), please help us spread the word. We are a small group of technology enthusiasts that want to continue developing products that will push the boundaries of content creation through our mobile devices. 
We have many ideas to develop as solutions, so your help will only inspire us to push forward with our dreams and goals to be a leading mobile hardware and software developer.
Thank you!

<p>The idea man, visionary of Social Coast Technologies and co-inventor of the iJUMP is Kellen Tallada. He is currently the Founder of uCommerce Solutions and now a social entrepreneur. Working with Mike Malloy the past year, CEO of Waveborn Sunglasses, a luxury Italian sunglasses company with a social mission opened his outlook on social impact and social entrepreneurship. </p>
<p>  With the positive reception of the iJUMP, he knew its potential could benefit a bigger cause and not only by its profits; in his case, youth homelessness. This cause hits home to Kellen having heard stories of his mother, who grew up in the poor neighborhoods of Caloocan City in the Philippines. His mother's single mother passed away when she was a young teenager leaving her and her 4 year old half sister to grow up on their own and in the streets. Through their personal strength, endurance, hard life experience and support of neighbors and family friends they made it through their teenage years and many years later started new lives in the United States.  The truth is that not everyone with similar stories had the same outcome. There are millions of homeless youth in US and worldwide that need help in many ways. This inspired Kellen to build Social Coast Tech around the iJUMP, a social enterprise tech company.   <img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/> </p>

stranger if you could borrow a “boost” from his/her’s smartphone. Connect both
smartphones to the iJUMP and watch your smartphone gain battery charge in a
matter of seconds! 




Colors
We plan to offer a modern, sleek design in one neutral color to start. We will offer several different cool colors to fit everyone's style and personality once we are in production and have developed the key relationships with manufacturers.
Available versions we plan to release



Android micro USB
– Samsung, HTC,  Nexus, LG 


 iPhone – 5, 5s and 6, 6plus only    





Patent Pending. Utility Provisional Patent filed with United States Patent & Trademark Office.

FAQ
How soon will Stand Up for Kids get their donation?
Immediately after the end of the crowd funding campaign. 
When will I get my iJUMP? 
Once the campaign reaches our
goal, manufacturing and fulfilling the pre-purchases may take 3-4 months
depending on certain suppliers. Our plans are to have them in your hands by the April of 2015 or earlier.  
How long does the charging take when using the
iJUMP? 
Our vision is a 5% boost for every minute the iJUMP is connected.
This is the goal and we are determine to work with the engineers to ensure this
feature.   
Currently, the prototype charges at the same rate as a standard wall charger or when a phone is attached to a computer via a USB connection.
  Does the iJUMP come in different colors? 
The first
manufactured units will only come in one neutral color. The plans are to have multiple
colors down the line.    We will contact all the funders once we are in manufacturing to update them on the final style and color. 
Is there a warranty?
We will be glad to replace
your iJUMP within one year of receiving it. This will only be available for
Indiegogo funders. You'll be responsible for the shipping costs.
  How do I
arrange a purchase? 
You order on this site. Simply click on the deal you want
from the deals listed on the right hand side of the page.  You can place
an order directly from this site.  
  Can you ship internationally?  
No,
we cannot ship outside the United States at the moment. 
How can I help?
The
biggest way that you can help the campaign is by telling your friends and
family about the campaign and encouraging them to back us at any level.

</div></div>","What is this?



Thank you for supporting. Wahoo is the first biped robot which can walk smoothly with only three servos and controlled by a smartphone. He will be the most affordable robot in his class.

 
[Wahoo only support Android smartphone. We are working on the iPhone version. Please come back in a couple weeks for updates.]

 

 

Portions of this robot are modifications based on work created and shared by Google and used according to terms described in the Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution License. 
 
 
Wahoo is roughly 15cm high, 9 cm diameter Android looking Robot made from a 3D printer. The legs and hip are power by 9g servos. He uses 6 x AAA batteries inside the legs. He uses Bluetooth to communicate with the Android smartphone. He can theoretically talk to any computer via Bluetooth. 
 
 

 


What We Need 
 
Bulk of the money raised will be spent on material cost like:

-3D printer -Robot electronics-ServosResearch on more sophisticated next generation home robots.

 
 
 
What You Get
 
We don't really have a minimum funding amount. You will receive a complete Wahoo Robot shipped to your home even if minimum funding amount is not met. 
You can control Wahoo with your smartphone. He can run on the table and on the floor. He can kick things so you can have a football tournament. Wahoo knows how to headbutt so if you buy two Wahoos they can fight.
Wahoo is configurable via the smartphone. For normal users they can change the parameters and change the way Wahoo walk. For advanced hobbyists and university researchers they can reprogram the Arduino circuit board for doing anything you can imagine e.g. one can add sensors to Wahoo and reprogram him with artificial intelligence. Because Wahoo robots are so affordable you can buy a few of them and command them by a computer to do complex tasks or simulations.
Please support me and the Wahoo project! Thank you!

<h2>The Details</h2>
<p>The tools are housed in a light but strong precision machined aircraft aluminum enclosure connected to your phone through molded outer polycarbonate bands. Use of the tools is simple - when stored the tools are secured via custom spring assemblies.

<h2><strong>2.5"" REMOVABLE KNIFE</strong></h2>
<p>Useful in so many situations, the knife is sharp but <strong>easily removable for flying or small cutting tasks</strong>.

<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>HARDENED SCREWDRIVERS</strong></h2>
<p>Three Screwdrivers are stored inside the case. Using the ejector button the screwdrivers can be removed and placed in the <strong>screwdriver slot</strong> at the top of the case. Use the case as your <strong>leverage</strong> to tackle those hard-to-loosen screws on your motorcycle, or perform an emergency electronics repair with the micro screwdriver.</p>

<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>PLIERS AND WIRE CUTTERS</strong></h2>
<p>Made from hardened tool steel and ground with an aggressive cross grip pattern, these <strong>pliers are small but mighty</strong>. When extended, the plier's handle pops out of the case edge for access. Use them to grip, twist, and grab; then use the wire cutter to <strong>snip through metal wire</strong>.</p>

<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>ALLEN WRENCHES</strong></h2>
<p>Screws and bolts that use <strong>Allen wrenches</strong> are found on bikes and many household items. <em>TaskOne</em> gives you access to six of the most useful sizes in a convenient removable tool. The wrenches are designed to give you plenty of torque for quick repairs and fixes on the go, are <strong>precisely ground</strong> for a perfect fit, and labeled with their wrench size.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-rbuTjN2RQCw/ULoRVyXf5rI/AAAAAAAACx4/UZhXpeKhUV4/s620/5mm_bikeseat_text.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>WIRE STRIPPER</strong></h2>
<p>The integrated <strong>wire stripper</strong> helps you make quick work of electrical repairs.  A broken wire can be re-stripped and re-connected with ease.</p>

<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>METRIC RULER</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Metric ruler marks</strong> are engraved on the back of the case. The first mark is precisely positioned 10mm from the bottom edge of the case so you can use the case surface as your measuring reference. Graduations of 1mm get you finer resolution for your measurements.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-BxHRPXc-8Ok/ULoRVwYfSDI/AAAAAAAACx8/xm2ZtXGSST4/s620/Ruler1_text.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>BOTTLE OPENER</strong></h2>
<p>No true multi-tool can be without a bottle opener.  This opener was optimized and tested on <strong>all types of bottles</strong> from Coke to beer and beyond. It is positioned right at the edge of the case for easy access, but protrudes just enough (but not too much) from the bottom of the case to reliably and easily open your favorite beverage. Open your next bottle with <em>TaskOne</em>!</p>

<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>KICKSTAND</strong></h2>
<p>Insert the small screwdriver into one of the two machined slots on the back of the phone and turn the tool into a <strong>convenient Kickstand</strong> for watching video or facetime! The kickstand can be used in either <strong>landscape or portrait</strong> mode.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>Q. How do I specify which color or iPhone case I want?    A. </strong>At the end of the campaign, we will send all backers an email asking for their choice of case style (iPhone 4/4s or 5) and color (for backers at $90 and up).</p>
<p><strong>Q. Will I be able to take this case on planes?</strong>     <strong>A. </strong>According to TSA rules, you may not take knives onto planes. We have made the knife portion of this case removable in seconds with no tools so it can be placed in your checked luggage.</p>
<p><strong>Q. Will using the tools break or damage my phone?    A. </strong>The design of the case protects your phone and allows the force of the tools to be distributed to the case without damaging your phone. That doesn't mean you can now use your phone as a hammer, but you don't have to worry about damage to your phone in normal use of any of the tools.</p>
<p><strong>Q. Can you offer other colors?    A.</strong> If we hit our reach goals, then <em>YES!</em></p>
<p><strong>Q. Are you going to offer replacement tools in case I lose one?    A. </strong>Yes, we will offer replacement tools for a low cost. All of the tools are secured in place while inside the case, so they won't fall out on their own.</p>
<p><strong>Q. How is the reception with the case installed?    A.</strong> We have tested and verified that reception is not affected when <em>TaskOne</em> is installed. The edge bands are designed out of a tough polycarbonate plastic which allow signals to pass through un-affected.</p>
<p><strong>Q. How much does the case weigh?    A. </strong>The iPhone 4/4s case weighs 89g and the iPhone 5 case weighs 96g.</p>

An iPhone case that can do MORE.
Your iPhone is your life. You carry it all the time.  You love your phone, but it falls short when you need to fix your bike, tighten a screw, or cut your steak. There isn't an app for that. But what if there was a CASE for that?


ENTER TASKONE - Now you can carry a multi-tool built right into the case of your iPhone.  Sixteen of the most useful tools engineered into a thin and trim package. And at 89 grams TaskOne adds suprisingly little weight to your phone. 
Utilizing quality hardened tool steels, aircraft aluminum, and polycarbonate, TaskOne is the next generation of multi-tools. 
Not only is TaskOne functional, but it is also stylishly designed. Its total thickness is as thin or thinner than many other cases, and comes in a variety of brilliant colors, including Slate Grey, Cherry Red, Jet Black, and the Indiegogo only color Orange Flame.  TaskOne does not sacrifice performance, yet is elegant and beautifully integrated with your phone.
 
The Tools
Sixteen tools are included in TaskOne. The tools are made to withstand the abuse of real life without ever damaging your phone.

The tools included in TaskOne are:


2.5"" knife with 0.75"" of serrations


1.8"" Sawblade


Small and Large flathead screwdrivers


Medium Phillips screwdriver


Pliers with integrated 3-8mm wrench


Wire cutters


6 metric Allen wrenches (bike sizes 2-6)


Spoke Wrenchs (0.127, 0.130)


Wire stripper


120mm ruler (110mm on iPhone 4/4s)


Bottle opener


Kickstand



The Details
The tools are housed in a light but strong precision machined aircraft aluminum enclosure connected to your phone through molded outer polycarbonate bands. Use of the tools is simple - when stored the tools are secured via custom spring assemblies. The tools are extended by the low-profile buttons on the back of the phone and are automatically fixed in the extended position during use. The raised bezel on the front of the case keeps the screen safe from damage.




 
2.5"" REMOVABLE KNIFE
Useful in so many situations, the knife is sharp but easily removable for flying or small cutting tasks. A steel lock secures the knife in the fully extended position for larger cutting tasks. The case serves as an excellent handle and is strong enough so your phone will never be harmed when using the knife.



 
 
1.8"" WOOD SAW
The saw is designed for optimal cutting of woods and plastics with a Peg Tooth saw pattern. Need to fashion a stick for roasting marshmallows on that impromptu camping trip you took with your friends?  No problem with TaskOne!

 
 
HARDENED SCREWDRIVERS
Three Screwdrivers are stored inside the case. Using the ejector button the screwdrivers can be removed and placed in the screwdriver slot at the top of the case. Use the case as your leverage to tackle those hard-to-loosen screws on your motorcycle, or perform an emergency electronics repair with the micro screwdriver.



 
 
PLIERS AND WIRE CUTTERS
Made from hardened tool steel and ground with an aggressive cross grip pattern, these pliers are small but mighty. When extended, the plier's handle pops out of the case edge for access. Use them to grip, twist, and grab; then use the wire cutter to snip through metal wire.

 
 
ALLEN WRENCHES
Screws and bolts that use Allen wrenches are found on bikes and many household items. TaskOne gives you access to six of the most useful sizes in a convenient removable tool. The wrenches are designed to give you plenty of torque for quick repairs and fixes on the go, are precisely ground for a perfect fit, and labeled with their wrench size.

 
 
WIRE STRIPPER
The integrated wire stripper helps you make quick work of electrical repairs.  A broken wire can be re-stripped and re-connected with ease.

 
 
METRIC RULER
Metric ruler marks are engraved on the back of the case. The first mark is precisely positioned 10mm from the bottom edge of the case so you can use the case surface as your measuring reference. Graduations of 1mm get you finer resolution for your measurements.

 
 
BOTTLE OPENER
No true multi-tool can be without a bottle opener.  This opener was optimized and tested on all types of bottles from Coke to beer and beyond. It is positioned right at the edge of the case for easy access, but protrudes just enough (but not too much) from the bottom of the case to reliably and easily open your favorite beverage. Open your next bottle with TaskOne!

 
 
KICKSTAND
Insert the small screwdriver into one of the two machined slots on the back of the phone and turn the tool into a convenient Kickstand for watching video or facetime! The kickstand can be used in either landscape or portrait mode.

 
 
FINE PRINT
We have been working hard designing and manufacturing the prototypes, setting up supply agreements with vendors, and getting everything in order for our first production run. TaskOne has gone through innumerable revisions and tests to get it to its current state.
With your support, we can bring TaskOne to the market and into your pocket. Your contributions will help fund:

FAQ
Q. How do I specify which color or iPhone case I want?    A. At the end of the campaign, we will send all backers an email asking for their choice of case style (iPhone 4/4s or 5) and color (for backers at $90 and up).
Q. Will I be able to take this case on planes?     A. According to TSA rules, you may not take knives onto planes. We have made the knife portion of this case removable in seconds with no tools so it can be placed in your checked luggage.
Q. Will using the tools break or damage my phone?    A. The design of the case protects your phone and allows the force of the tools to be distributed to the case without damaging your phone. That doesn't mean you can now use your phone as a hammer, but you don't have to worry about damage to your phone in normal use of any of the tools.
Q. Can you offer other colors?    A. If we hit our reach goals, then YES!
Q. Are you going to offer replacement tools in case I lose one?    A. Yes, we will offer replacement tools for a low cost. All of the tools are secured in place while inside the case, so they won't fall out on their own.
Q. How is the reception with the case installed?    A. We have tested and verified that reception is not affected when TaskOne is installed. The edge bands are designed out of a tough polycarbonate plastic which allow signals to pass through un-affected.
Q. How much does the case weigh?    A. The iPhone 4/4s case weighs 89g and the iPhone 5 case weighs 96g.

<p>What’s Next:</p>
<p>Our next steps are
to finalize the tooling for our molds and work with the engineers to carefully
sculpt the final case dimensions.  The key to creating this unique case
includes precision engraving and prototyping of every aspect of the case. 
This includes the filling and sealing of the three layer construction that is
part of our patented process.  We have to test and finalized the viscosity
of the fill liquids to ensure maximum performance that will last for years and

Working with a team of engineers he constructed the first prototype late one
night.  His vast 23 year experience in manufacturing and design while
working for a fortune 500 company gave him the foundation to create this new

<ul>
<li>
<p>Are your net communications

<li>
<p>Are they secure ? No.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forget the NSA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In march this year I was
	approached by an individual on the web who gave me as a sample of his
	work. The personal information of one million US voters from all
	across the US. 
	</p>

<li>
<p>This incident was the ignition for
	this project. Why, most identity theft occurs via messaging or over
	the phone not in person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If they want your birthday they
	can find it, but they shouldn’t be able to spoof your phone

</li>
<li>
<p>This alarming episode drove me
	this project</p>

<li>
<p>Your most immediate threat is not

</li>
<li>
<p>Its from identity and information

</li>
<li>
<p>Personal security if left to

</li>
<li>
<p>Enforced anonymity allows the user

Are your net communications
	private ? No.


Are they secure ? No.


Forget the NSA


In march this year I was
	approached by an individual on the web who gave me as a sample of his
	work. The personal information of one million US voters from all
	across the US. 
	


Phone numbers dates of births,
	home addresses, middle names, party affiliations and more.


Just as a sample!


This incident was the ignition for
	this project. Why, most identity theft occurs via messaging or over
	the phone not in person.


If they want your birthday they
	can find it, but they shouldn’t be able to spoof your phone
	numbers, or messaging.


This alarming episode drove me
	this project


Your most immediate threat is not
	from governments or shady organizations.


Its from identity and information
	thieves.


Personal security if left to
	chance can be financially and personally devastating.


The objective of this project is
	to create a closed loop 2048 bit SSL encrypted pathway for all of my
	customers communications, from typical internet traffic, to
	voice,video and messaging.


Enforced anonymity allows the user
	to retain privacy in communication from end to end users across
	globe.


Target customers are retail
	consumers, public institutions and businesses.




Status
of Project
http://www.sideeffectsystems.com/index.php?called=calvin_yjajym

Currently  the system is in alpha
testing phase, investments have already been made in several servers, development systems and software, communication systems and features are still being tweaked.Current mobile device operating system target is Android (Software available for download on site).It is compatible with all SIP 2.0 and WebRTC systems including TLS and wss.It works on all the latest browser systems for all the main platforms.

The requested investment is primarily for Operating Expenditure for Marketing, expansion from a test environment to a
production environment and the purchase of Symantec RSA and SSL
Certificates, Private and Public Keys to complete the secure
architecture loop.In summary, the project is done and testable online, to be examine and criticised.

First priority spending with the funding is SSL Certs and keys.


Purchase of new servers for a production deployment and rollout.


Marketing and Promotion (Skills and Personnel) with which you can also be of help .


OpEx Stipend for small staff of three etc..


Issues
Affecting Project Success
The primary risk to this project is
legal and regulatory, local restrictions on internet usage and
governmental requirements on encryption. Also net neutrality is under
threat which severely impacts the ability of the software to be
successful in the future.
Competition is a driver but  that just
means the project will on cycles of development and  maintenance  in
order to keep it technically relevant.
Inclusion of site function implicitly
in popular web browsers or the Ooperating Systems.
As always money is good but not enough, you contribution by helping me test, critiquing and offering preferred suggestion go a long way to this projects success.

Imagine being in the mood for a romantic, cozy, and unexpected anniversary and showing up to get seated to a candle and rose already set up at your table in the cozy corner of the restaurant. If you come on an off-day, that might even mean a personal greeting from the owner or the chef sending you a complimentary treat. For a business meeting this could mean getting a private area and being interrupted less. For a social and epic birthday, use your imagination!</p><p>The better the restaurants make it fit your mood, the higher chance you’ll recommend them for it when you leave. How far will restaurants and venues push the boundaries to be the most romantic, epic, or best place to impress a client?</p><p>It’s all about the experience and we have designed a system that works around what experience you feel like, and it being delivered.</p><p><span><br/></span></p><h1><span>Referral Program</span></h1><div>

Through nurturing crowd-sourced recommendations on what moods and occasions restaurants and venues best fit, Tangoo paints a story of how well a place matches your desired experience by going beyond cuisine-type and quality ratings.Our Secret SauceTangoo also enhances your outing by encouraging restaurants to best cater the experience around your mood with perks and personalization depending on the situation.The Impact: Help Restaurants Stand Out Through Giving You Personalized ExperiencesWe have met with our over 100 restaurant and bar partners in the past month and they couldn’t be more excited about Tangoo’s new direction. They admit that they have been abused with harmful online reviews and aggressive discounts and want to find a new way to share their story and create loyal customers.Tangoo is a new way for them to share their story and highlight the unique experience they offer. They see incredible value in widening the scope of traditional online filters like cuisine, price, and neighbourhood to experiential filters such as the moods and the occasions they best serve.We have also learned that if they know more about why you are visiting and how you feel, they can actually enhance the experience by personalizing it to that. Imagine being in the mood for a romantic, cozy, and unexpected anniversary and showing up to get seated to a candle and rose already set up at your table in the cozy corner of the restaurant. If you come on an off-day, that might even mean a personal greeting from the owner or the chef sending you a complimentary treat. For a business meeting this could mean getting a private area and being interrupted less. For a social and epic birthday, use your imagination!The better the restaurants make it fit your mood, the higher chance you’ll recommend them for it when you leave. How far will restaurants and venues push the boundaries to be the most romantic, epic, or best place to impress a client?It’s all about the experience and we have designed a system that works around what experience you feel like, and it being delivered.Referral Program

PerksOur Story: www.tangoo.ca Two years ago, a group of UBC students set out on a mission to help people stay connected with the people they care most about through memorable social outings.We started by organizing nights at hand-picked restaurants that took all guesswork and planning from people so they could focus on having a great social outing. Guests could pre-book online with everything taken care of when they arrived - that meant no line, reserved seats, a specialized menu from the chef, and a chance to meet new people and reconnect with old friends. The word started to get out quickly as Tangoo was featured in over 25 media appearances in Vancouver. After hosting various events and working closely with over a hundred of Vancouver’s best establishments, we learned what it took to make a perfect night happen over and over again. We realized we needed to rebuild the experience onto a platform to keep up with demand and expand beyond Vancouver's borders.CTV: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCEgUcQxB6cGlobal TV: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhDnKzNm5bY Shaw TV: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVrszGCe41kWe never stop dreaming up new ways for you to get the most out of your social life.Our WhyWe believe that the best way to connect with people you care about is through perfect social outings. These are what create the lasting memories that bond people together. When it’s easy to organize an authentic outing tailored to what you want, you are empowered to live in the moment. Our Campaign: Leveraging Dragons' Den for a North America-Wide Launch We realized that we were on to something big when we got the call to pitch on Dragons’ Den in April, and turned it into the perfect opportunity to expand our mission across Canada and beyond.  We can't tell you exactly what happened on The Den, but we can tell you that we'd like to be rocking a fully functional product by the time our AWESOME episode airs as early as September - so please help us make it happen!Check out a warm-up pitch we had with one of the Dragons a year before we appeared on the show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSy_tpRSzMQHelp us plant our feet across Canada and then, the US.With Dragons' Den going well and 2 million Canadians ready to see it as early as September, we have a lot of work to do in order to be set up in all the major Canadian cities we want to be set up in.Every month is crucial for building out our team and both iOS and Android apps. No matter what happens, we need to grow our platform as much as possible so we need your help to successfully launch the finalized versions of the platform.Timeline of successes from inception We've had the help of over 30 interns and practicum students (alongside an amazing advisory board) the last two years to push our Why to the stage it is at today. People know this dream has to happen and we're ever so close!Other Ways You Can Help

<h3><strong>Smart Mega Machine™ or Internet Sports Computer™ News Article</strong></h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Wireless Week.</strong> — The folks who made it possible to play golf over the Internet are planning a new game. Internet Golf Multimedia Inc. here hopes to launch next year the Java-based Internet Sports Computer (ISC), which will handle both golf and <a href=""http://www.eetimes.com/General/PrintView/4039584"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Coupon Companion"">interactive sports</a> that ""volley"" by recording and relaying the players' muscle contractions in real-time.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The company's original smart golf club, the Genius, enabled opponents to remotely play golf against each other on a PC by measuring their real-world performance in hitting a real ball. The ISC, by contrast, will be a freestanding, <a href=""http://www.eetimes.com/General/PrintView/4039584"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Coupon Companion"">wireless</a> unit that expands beyond golf to a more generic format capable of representing a variety of one-on-one games — basketball, tennis, racket ball or even a one-on-one baseball variant that is illegal everywhere except cyberspace.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">On the other hand, the Internet Sports Computer includes the hardware for real-time transmission of motion information in games where both players are acting simultaneously-such as tennis volleys. Sophisticated motion analysis routines are being put into a custom chip, said the company, to animate a figure on the screen. The animated figure can be used to pinpoint problems with the movements in a swing.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Where the Genius golf club uses PC software along with a couple of ASICs and an RF transceiver, the freestanding ISC has an embedded microprocessor. The smart club (or a smart racket) will communicate with the belt-pack-mounted ISC, which in turn uses a wireless communications strategy to access the Internet.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">For the future, the ISC will supplement its <strong><a href=""http://www.eetimes.com/General/PrintView/4039584"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Coupon Companion"">golf putter</a></strong> with a new driver model and a new line of wireless tennis rackets, baseball bats, basketballs and other smart sports gear. Because each device is wireless, the clubs, rackets and bats can be taken outdoors, Murdock pointed out.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">""Eventually we hope to mediate not just one-to-one <a href=""http://www.eetimes.com/General/PrintView/4039584"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Coupon Companion"">contests</a>, but contests among thousands of different players worldwide,"" said Murdock.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Electronic Engineering Times</strong> - ""The club is said to have a look and heft of our average driver but when a golfer hits a golf ball with it, several sensors in the club's head detect where and how contact with the ball is made. An embedded computer analyzes the input from the sensor array and determines whether contact with sensor array and determines whether contact was made on the clubs heel, toe, “or sweet spot.”</p>

Smart Mega Machine™ (SMM) or Internet Sports Computer™ (ISC) and Smart Controller in the News

Smart Mega Machine™ or Internet Sports Computer™ News Article
Wireless Week. — The folks who made it possible to play golf over the Internet are planning a new game. Internet Golf Multimedia Inc. here hopes to launch next year the Java-based Internet Sports Computer (ISC), which will handle both golf and interactive sports that ""volley"" by recording and relaying the players' muscle contractions in real-time.
The company's original smart golf club, the Genius, enabled opponents to remotely play golf against each other on a PC by measuring their real-world performance in hitting a real ball. The ISC, by contrast, will be a freestanding, wireless unit that expands beyond golf to a more generic format capable of representing a variety of one-on-one games — basketball, tennis, racket ball or even a one-on-one baseball variant that is illegal everywhere except cyberspace.
On the other hand, the Internet Sports Computer includes the hardware for real-time transmission of motion information in games where both players are acting simultaneously-such as tennis volleys. Sophisticated motion analysis routines are being put into a custom chip, said the company, to animate a figure on the screen. The animated figure can be used to pinpoint problems with the movements in a swing.
Where the Genius golf club uses PC software along with a couple of ASICs and an RF transceiver, the freestanding ISC has an embedded microprocessor. The smart club (or a smart racket) will communicate with the belt-pack-mounted ISC, which in turn uses a wireless communications strategy to access the Internet.
For the future, the ISC will supplement its golf putter with a new driver model and a new line of wireless tennis rackets, baseball bats, basketballs and other smart sports gear. Because each device is wireless, the clubs, rackets and bats can be taken outdoors, Murdock pointed out.
""Eventually we hope to mediate not just one-to-one contests, but contests among thousands of different players worldwide,"" said Murdock.
 
Smart Controller in the News


Electronic Engineering Times - ""The club is said to have a look and heft of our average driver but when a golfer hits a golf ball with it, several sensors in the club's head detect where and how contact with the ball is made. An embedded computer analyzes the input from the sensor array and determines whether contact with sensor array and determines whether contact was made on the clubs heel, toe, “or sweet spot.”



EE Times - After the ball is struck, a voice (speaking either English or Japanese tells the golf weather he hit the ball on the club's Sweet spot or right or left of it.



Triangle business Journal - A New York entrepreneur whose firm has developed a “smart” golf club is scouting North Carolina for a plant site to manufacture the clubs.



EE Times - Blending Java and biofeedback technologies, Internet Golf Multimedia Inc. (Bronx, New York) has created what it calls the world's first smart golf club, which a user can link to the Internet to compete in a global golf competition. The club is a genuine putter of with an aforementioned circuitry and off-the-shelf RF transceiver located in its head.



The New York Times - But the Internet opens up even more intriguing possibility: letting golfers compete simultaneously even when teeing up the ball thousand miles apart. Mr. Murdock wants to use cyberspace to free players from the constraints of distance to enjoying not simply a multiplayer virtual game – like sapping digital zombies or racing on 3 – D race tracks – but a game is “totally legal.”



New York Daily News – using their knowledge of electrical engineering and fiber optics, they've created club said that let golfers used their home computers to play against one another from anywhere in the world.

Wireless Week - Up for around the wireless golf?  Players can watch the best trajectory communicate in real time with distant opponents. It wirelessly synchronizes your motion and movement with the way your brain functions.


Golf Digest- Feedback constantly forms of an actual voice in a digital display that indicates how close contact comes in the sweet spot.

<p>Our goal:  To be the social network Pope Francis <b>WILL</b> join!</p><p>DeoSpace - <i>the</i> social network of the New
Evangelization - brings you dramatic, relevant connections to all aspects of the
life of the Church.  The <a href=""http://www.news.va/en/news/global-catholic-social-network-launched-under-the-"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vatican announced</a> the new Catholic social network in March 2014, and since then the
network has grown steadily.  We’re
anxious to launch in more languages – currently we feature Spanish, Italian and
English – and reach a huge audience of Catholics worldwide.</p>
<p>DeoSpace
is a platform whose time has come.  It
provides a virtual overlay for the world’s largest physical social network –
the Catholic Church.  Today social media dominate mass
communications at all levels.  DeoSpace is an answer to the Church’s call
to “baptize” the Internet.  By your
participation in this campaign and as a DeoSpace member, you can make an
enduring contribution to the New Evangelization.</p>
<p>DeoSpace.com is a
communication vehicle that enlivens parish and diocesan life by providing a
platform to extend prayer after liturgy, helping to build community and
accelerate faith formation. DeoSpace puts the best of the digital world at the
service of the church, giving even the busiest families a way to connect to
their own parish, their diocese and the Universal Church. If you would like to
make a <i>significant, lasting contribution</i>
to the Catholic Church of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century, DeoSpace is for you.  Your <b>tax

<p>
</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Why DeoSpace Matters</b></p>
<p>The Catholic Church is a ready-made social
network in itself, we simply overlay the physical infrastructure with the
virtual network – and we will have 100 million users before you know it. Social
networks dominate mass communications at all levels.  By creating our own
social media vehicle, the Church has a great opportunity to take the leadership
in the next frontier of mass communications.  The Church was left behind
in the print, radio, and TV but here we have the
chance to be at the forefront.  </p>
<p>So
what’s different about <a href=""http://www.deospace.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DeoSpace</a>?  On DeoSpace <b><i>you
are an individual in the image and likeness of God</i></b>.  Other social networks are really advertising delivery systems using connectivity to family and friends so
someone can sell you something.  On
DeoSpace the connectivity we’re focused on for users is to the Universal
Church.  DeoSpace seeks to
connect hearts and souls and thereby build the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>DeoSpace is an exciting opportunity to change
the paradigm of the Internet and Catholics’ interaction with it.  DeoSpace represents this generation’s chance
to make a real and lasting difference in evangelization, community,
sustainability and the Universal Church. If you’ve ever wanted to make a
difference in salvation history, this is your chance.  Become a part of the DeoSpace family as a

<li>(Translated from Russian) I think
this web site is really cool, for real, even though there are not as many
people like on facebook, but it is just the begining and I like it so much.
Here, I feel like I am at home, but actually I am really very far from my

just talk to people! Oh I like this web site so much! Thanks God, we run it!  <br/>

<li>I am very happy that you have
created this social network for Catholics.<br/>

<li>(From Nigeria) My name is Joseph,
I am really very excited to see this new Catholic Global Network site being
launched. We need a place like this, so as to share our views with each other
without the hindrance of internet trolls causing disruptions and contentions

What is DeoSpace.com?
Our goal:  To be the social network Pope Francis WILL join!DeoSpace - the social network of the New
Evangelization - brings you dramatic, relevant connections to all aspects of the
life of the Church.  The Vatican announced the new Catholic social network in March 2014, and since then the
network has grown steadily.  We’re
anxious to launch in more languages – currently we feature Spanish, Italian and
English – and reach a huge audience of Catholics worldwide.
DeoSpace
is a platform whose time has come.  It
provides a virtual overlay for the world’s largest physical social network –
the Catholic Church.  Today social media dominate mass
communications at all levels.  DeoSpace is an answer to the Church’s call
to “baptize” the Internet.  By your
participation in this campaign and as a DeoSpace member, you can make an
enduring contribution to the New Evangelization.
DeoSpace.com is a
communication vehicle that enlivens parish and diocesan life by providing a
platform to extend prayer after liturgy, helping to build community and
accelerate faith formation. DeoSpace puts the best of the digital world at the
service of the church, giving even the busiest families a way to connect to
their own parish, their diocese and the Universal Church. If you would like to
make a significant, lasting contribution
to the Catholic Church of the 21st Century, DeoSpace is for you.  Your tax
deductible contribution helps DeoSpace.com expand and grow.

Why DeoSpace Matters
The Catholic Church is a ready-made social
network in itself, we simply overlay the physical infrastructure with the
virtual network – and we will have 100 million users before you know it. Social
networks dominate mass communications at all levels.  By creating our own
social media vehicle, the Church has a great opportunity to take the leadership
in the next frontier of mass communications.  The Church was left behind
in the print, radio, and TV but here we have the
chance to be at the forefront.  
So
what’s different about DeoSpace?  On DeoSpace you
are an individual in the image and likeness of God.  Other social networks are really advertising delivery systems using connectivity to family and friends so
someone can sell you something.  On
DeoSpace the connectivity we’re focused on for users is to the Universal
Church.  DeoSpace seeks to
connect hearts and souls and thereby build the Kingdom of God.
DeoSpace is an exciting opportunity to change
the paradigm of the Internet and Catholics’ interaction with it.  DeoSpace represents this generation’s chance
to make a real and lasting difference in evangelization, community,
sustainability and the Universal Church. If you’ve ever wanted to make a
difference in salvation history, this is your chance.  Become a part of the DeoSpace family as a
social network member and help our campaign with your contribution today.                                                           How
will Funds be Used?
The first $50,000 will
enable us to acquire and host the additional servers we need to support the
growth of our user base, extend the
functionalities of the network, and allow DeoSpace to begin to hire and expand our team.  As our membership grows we come closer to the goal of being self-sustaining.   All contributions to DeoSpace are tax deductible.Other than crowdfunding, other funding sources include, but are not
limited to:

Partnerships

Advertisers

Grants

Large Donors

Please count on my prayers for
DeoSpace – which is extending the Kingdom!


Muchas felicidades y que bueno que se tenga esta red para hacer
presente la experiencia de Dios en nuestra vidas y en nuestras comunidades.  Translation:  Congratulations
and it is good that this network will present the experience of God in our
lives and in our communities.

I really think this website is a
great gift from God, I saw so many blasphemies for Our Lord and Our Holy
Mother, that I tried to fight against, but Facebook doesn´t do much for that
causes, unfortunately.


Feliz por este proyecto que nos incluye como comunidad de la gran
Iglesia que todos formamos – Translation:  I am happy for this project which includes
all of us as the great church community that we are all


Ottima iniziativa. Network interessante.  Translation:  Excellent
initiative.  Interesting network.

Thanks for friendship! Glory be
to the God for DeoSpace.com!

Dear brothers & sisters in
Christ Jesus - God bless and keep you. May the hand of Mary Refuge of Sinners
protect you, I send a hug in Christ Jesus.

(Translated from Russian) I think
this web site is really cool, for real, even though there are not as many
people like on facebook, but it is just the begining and I like it so much.
Here, I feel like I am at home, but actually I am really very far from my
family) Here, I want to share some useful info about our Christian daily life,
just talk to people! Oh I like this web site so much! Thanks God, we run it!  

I am very happy that you have
created this social network for Catholics.

(From Nigeria) My name is Joseph,
I am really very excited to see this new Catholic Global Network site being
launched. We need a place like this, so as to share our views with each other
without the hindrance of internet trolls causing disruptions and contentions
with their words of hatred.  I hope in
time to get to know many of you who share the thirst and love for Our ­Savior,
Jesus Christ and his One and Only Apostolic Church. Thank you.

Hoping that DeoSpace expands and
attracts more and more attention. Maybe it's utopian to think that can replace
Facebook (which is now very integrated in various operating systems) but at
least we can be a true landmark.

<h3>Why Touchmenu?</h3>
<div>
<p><em>""So its Friday night, date night maybe, and you show up to your favorite restaurant only to find out there's over a half hour wait.""</em></p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>If you're lucky some places might provide you with a paging device that notifies you when your table is ready. (<em>""Hey, 1995 called, they want their pagers back."") </em>Next, the hostess seats you and you wait patiently until your server arrives to take drink orders. ""I'll have the Very Berry Limeade, please."" While the server frantically juggles another ten tables, you look over the menu and try to create images in your mind from the ""mouth-watering"" descriptions of the items that didn't quite make the cut to get their photo taken.</p>
<p>Then, like any normal human being you get distracted while talking to your friends and forget you still have to decide what it is you want to eat tonight. As the underpaid and over worked server comes by for the second time you frantically scan the menu for anything that looks appetizing, but all you see are words. By this time you couldn't care less what you get. It beats looking like a fool in front of your friends as you ask the ever so patient waitress to ""please come back.""</p>
<p>Now that you've decided what you want you can finally relax and enjoy. Or can you? My problem is I relax too much and for some reason wait until the last possible second to decide to get dessert. Its usually about this time that the server comes by with the dessert menu and then I regret not ordering it 20 minutes ago instead of now, when I'd rather just go home and fall into a food coma.</p>
<p>Things don't need to be this complicated and old fashioned. Take a look at what we came up with to make eating out a lot more efficient, and of course, fun!</p>
<h3>Place and pay for orders at any time</h3>
<div><em><strong>""You can order whenever you're ready and as many times as you want.""</strong></em></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Unlike traditional menus, the tablets never leave the table. So if you're sitting there enjoying your delicious rib-eye and you decide you want that molten lava chocolate cake you've had your eye on, simply submit it to your check and your server will have it out to you before you can say ""could I see a dessert menu?""  </div>
<p>Also, don't feel like you have to inconvenience the server when you're ready to leave. Just select your payment method, provide the necessary information and voilà, you're done!</p>
<h3>Make real-time reservations &amp; place orders</h3>
<div><em><strong>""Remember the days when we had to wait almost an hour to be seated?""</strong></em></div>
</div>
<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/340/872/294576bb6cd7cabe21cf2603b86fcb38_large.png?1358301545"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p>The world is moving at a much faster pace today and people are busier than ever. With the Touchmenu mobile app you'll be able to cut up to an hour off your wait time by ordering and reserving your table before you even get to the restaurant.</p>
<h3>Customizing your meal</h3>
<p>Let's be honest, when it comes to what we eat, people are as different as their hairstyles. With Touchmenu you can check the nutrition facts of an item and even personalize it to your preference. Choose to remove cheese, add extra sauce, put the dressing on the side, or cook it medium rare. And its all at your fingertips!</p>
<h3>Play games</h3>
<p>Instead of staring awkwardly at your date or listening to grandpa tell <em>his</em> version of D-day, play some entertaining multi-player games that are sure to make waiting a whole lot more fun! </p>
<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/459/056/882ba3d3ec0091585f422d05b823de24_large.png?1363816581"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<h3>Watch movie trailers &amp; purchase tickets</h3>
<p>While you wait you can watch movie trailers and get showtimes. And if you see one you like you can even purchase tickets!</p>
<h3>Splitting checks</h3>
<p>When you're ready to leave, you can specify who pays for what with simple ""drag and drop.""</p>

<h3>The Last Word</h3>
<p>We believe that this modernization is just what the restaurant industry needs to stand out in the fast pace of our world today. Everything around us is modernizing more and more each day. In the last five years we've seen movie rentals go digital, mobile internet become commonplace, life experiences can be shared worldwide through social networking, and touchscreen devices are in the hands of children as young as two. We are an ever changing people. We long for innovation. As our lives get busier we expect things to move faster too.</p></div>","What are people saying about touchscreen menus?

And certainly couldn’t help repair the damage caused by debris, namely the oxide/arcing (black marks) you may have noticed on cable tips, and won’t have noticed on the connector pins inside your Lightning port.So we set out to create the ultimate multi-tool to address all aspects of cleaning your Lightning ports and cables, ensuring reliable connectivity, and reviving damaged ports and cables. PurePort’s seven tools help you address three essential issues: Tools 1-4: Clean & Revive Lightning PortsThe first four tools make it easy and safe to remove ALL types of debris from your Lightning port. Even reaching the hard-to-reach cavity behind the retainer springs on the edges of the port, repairing oxide damage on internal pins, and removing stains and non-dry contaminants. Tools 5-6: Clean & Revive Lightning Connectors on Cables and AccessoriesThe next two tools can clean the tips of your cables of dry debris and stains. And also reduce oxide damage (the black marks where arcing over the connector has pitted the delicate contacts), restoring strong connectivity. Tool 7: Speaker & Switch BrushTo keep your iPhone’s other ‘orifices’ clean, we’ve designed the perfect size, shape, bristle thickness/length mini brush. Use it to clean the lint that tends to build up in the speakers and headphone of your device, as well as around switches. If your speaker holes, or headphone slot (where sound comes from when you’re on the phone), look grey or white, it’s likely they’re filled with lint and dust – if they’re clean they should appear black.Unique Multi-Tool DesignWe’ve combined all these tools into a unique multi-tool ‘Swiss Army Knife’ design. Remove and reverse each tool to use it - the body acts as a handle. Or use each tool stand-alone if you prefer.Micro-Fiber Surface ClothTo make PurePort the ‘complete’ tool for iPhone and iPad cleaning, we added our preferred surface cleaning solution – a high quality micro-fiber cloth – lint free of course!Occasional cleaning of your iPhone, iPad and accessories with PurePort will:Benefits 1 and 2 alone are worth up to $650 for a typical Apple household over five years, in reduced device and cable replacement. But for many iPhone and iPad enthusiasts, being FREE from annoying unreliable connections is the most important thing. All for little more than the price of a single replacement cable...  Before and AfterThe problem with contamination of electronic connections, especially inside a Lightning port, is you can’t SEE how bad it is – so you’ll only know it’s a problem when it starts impacting your daily charging and connecting.A quick clean with PurePort, tools 1-4, can dramatically improve the state of your port and electronic connections:PurePort tools 5-6 can not only clean the connectors, but reduce the visible oxide/arcing damage (blackening), and restore them to reliable connectivity: PurePort will actually reduce the number of new cables you buy – remember, it’s usually not the cable to blame, the cable tips are just ‘the victim’ of contamination inside your device! example of PurePort in usePurePort was founded when wife-and-husband team, Kate & Josh Swinnerton, got tired of cleaning the ports on their iPhones and their young kids’ iPads. After trying many home remedies, and seriously damaging an iPhone with a paperclip (!) they went searching for a product to clean Lightning ports ‘properly’ – but found nothing adequate. Researching the problem extensively, they were surprised how many other Apple users also had regular problems with unreliable Lightning port connections – over half of those surveyed complained of similar issues!Using a digital microscope, they looked inside 100s of Lightning ports, and were shocked by the amount of hair, lint, dust, stains and other debris found, even when the devices looked clean on the outside. The PurePort team was put together internationally to further research and develop the product. The team are a group of diverse designers, engineers and digital marketers passionate about keeping their iPhones and iPads working perfectly and free from annoying connection issues. Manufacturing We’ve partnered with product design and manufacturing experts Production Partners to ensure PurePort is effective, high quality, and gets to market (and into your hands) ASAP.Production Partners are the design and manufacturing powerhouse behind a string of successful products - KickStarter projects as well as innovative product developments for major brands. Check out their amazing work HERE.We’ve worked with Production Partners for over 18 months to refine the PurePort design, with extensive Design-for-Manufacture (DfM) optimization of the design to ensure the product can be made at scale and quality. Production Partners will coordinate all aspects of the manufacture, assembly and quality control of your PurePort. Our team followed a rigorous, research-centric process in developing PurePort – from extensive analysis of home remedies and adjacent solutions, to examining relevant cleaning tools used in other industries, and of course a great deal of trial-and-error. The PurePort multi-tool concept developed out of the realization that no single tool could possibly clean all types of contamination from both ports and cables, or repair the oxide damage found in many cases.We took the key tools required to do the job, and combined them into a convenient multi-tool that keeps all sub-tools together and stores each tool, while also acting as a handle.The multi-tool approach, and the designs of key sub-tools, are now the subject of a US patent and design registration.If you've read this far, we HUGELY appreciate your support and interest!If you have questions, please check our FAQ or ask us in comments - we're happy to help.Choose a reward, back us and we'll get you your very own PurePort, so you can keep clean INSIDE as well as out..As one of the first crowdfunding marketing agencies, Enventys Partners has brought more than 750 crowdfunding projects to life through lead generation, campaign page creation, public relations, email marketing, Facebook Advertising, campaign management and more.We're working with BackerKit to ensure an easy delivery experience, wherever you are in the world.Risks and challengesWith your support, we’re confident that we can not only deliver PurePort, but do so promptly and to an exceptional level of quality.

Smart homes will be ubiquitous in the near future, which is why we built Angee to be intelligent, unobtrusive, and, mostly importantly, to just work.Perhaps Angee’s most important function is fully-automated smart security to protect your home and family. With voice recognition, at-the-door identification, and a portable 360° rotating camera—all without any subscription fees—Angee is revolutionizing home security.




But Angee does so much more than just security. It’s voice-controlled and integrates with your other smart home devices and favorite apps. It has two-way audio and streaming video so you can keep in touch from anyway in the world. And its portable camera is fun, great for recording and sharing! Give your home an upgrade. Get Angee and simplify your world.













Angee automatically arms and disarms based on your location by using phone recognition, with backup voice password authentication. That means no need to enter a code every time you enter or leave your home.
While Angee is meant to be kept in a room where you spend a lot of your time, the entrances and exits of your home are the most important places to monitor. Angee is the world’s first smart security system with complete perimeter security. Just stick security tags on doors and windows and Angee will know exactly who comes and goes.




With Angee you can easily set up to four 'activity zones' which Angee can keep watch over specifically. Angee can keep an eye on your back door, work station, or any other area, and alert you if anyone trespasses in these zones.

Not everyone wants a camera running while they’re home. Angee gets that. Angee will turn away whenever you ask, or you can set Angee not to record you at all and only film unrecognized people. Angee monitors when and how you want it to.


You talk – Angee listens. Angee can understand what you say and who you are. To give you an alternative authentication, set a voice password so that Angee can identify you. You can use your voice as a backup when your phone is dead. Angee is customizable and it's up to you what level of security you choose.
A cool side effect of voice recognition is that all of Angee's intelligent functionality is voice-controlled, so you get hands free communication, access to your favourite online services, and more. 








If your “smart” devices can’t talk to each other, then they’re not really that smart.  Angee gets this, which is why we built Angee to integrate with your other smart devices like Philips Hue, the Honeywell WiFi Smart Thermostat, Belkin WeMo products, and many more more.  Angee’s intelligent machine learning quickly recognizes your normal patterns, and it manages your devices to cohesively work together around the way you live.
For developers and enthusiasts we have an open REST API and IFTTT platform support, so the possibilities are endless for creating your own applications and solutions to integrate with Angee.



Travel a lot? Have people you need to check in on? Angee’s HD video streaming and two-audio makes it easier than ever to communicate with whoever is at home using your smartphone, smartwatch, tablet, or the web. Say you’re on a business trip and you check Angee to find your daughter doing homework in the living room. You can just say hi and start helping her on her algebra! 

Angee's built-in battery lasts 10 hours, making it ideal for keeping an eye on your kids or pets while you’re away or even just in another room.  It also enables Angee to keep working in case of a power outage. Should that happen, you'll receive a notification that the power has gone out and Angee will continue monitoring. If your WiFi goes offline, the server will notify you and Angee will continue to record any activity at home, saving the footage to her local storage.





The most amazing memories aren’t planned. Take Angee wherever the action is, and it’s motion-tracking camera will catch whatever happens. Whether it’s for streaming dance performances for grandparents on the other side of the country or just for catching the weird stuff your cat does, Angee is loads of fun to have around!






Whether it's for your smartphone, iPad or your smart watch we have designed the mobile experience to be a perfect natural extension of interaction with Angee. Connect to your home from anywhere and instantly understand what’s going on there.




Angee tells you what’s happening at home via a beautiful app which works on any device. You’ll receive an instant notification on your smartphone, tablet, and smartwatch if something out of the ordinary happens, and you can also use the app or the web to connect with Angee remotely and see what she sees.





Angee uses smart triggers to detect and record events that matter, so you don't have to waste storage of uneventful video footage. On top of this, we provide 1GB of free cloud storage – no monthly fees required!

<p><a rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>Can Flosstime
stick on wallpaper or other surfaces? </u></a></p>
<p>No. Flosstime is designed to be mounted on your mirror and some tiled

the rear panel and replace both the floss and batteries through the back of the
device. When Flosstime is ready to be shipped, replacement kits will be
available for purchase on our website. We will also provide recycling
information in case floss/battery replacement is not something you desire.</p>
<p><a rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>How long does
the battery last? </u></a></p>
<p>About a year.</p>
<p><a rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>Can I set the

<p>No. The device gives you exactly 18” of floss, as is recommended by
dentists and the ADA.</p>
<p><a rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>Can I control
the timing sequence for the reminder? </u></a></p>
<p>No. Dentists recommend that you floss once everyday so the device will

</div></div>","Flosstime is a smart floss dispenser elegantly designed to help you build daily flossing habits. We know we're supposed to floss, but most of us forget. Traditional floss dispensers are old, outdated and hard to remember. Flosstime is a habit-forming device that will make flossing fun and nearly impossible to forget (patent-pending). How does Flosstime work?Flosstime easily mounts to your bathroom mirror or wall with durable and removable microsuction tape or an adhesive strip.With a push of a button, Flosstime automatically dispenses exactly 18 inches of floss, the amount recommended by dentists and the American Dental Association. Our research shows that the biggest problem with flossing is simply getting the floss into your hands. Once it's there, almost everyone flosses properly! The automatic dispensing mechanism makes it easier for you to start flossing and removes the worry of having too much or too little.To form long term habits, according to Charles Duhigg in his seminal book ""The Power of Habit"", there must exist three key elements: cue, routine and reward. Flosstime is designed with all of these in mind. After flossing, Flosstime will light up with a blue smile for a job well done. If not used daily, an orange frown or reminder light cues the user that it is time to floss again.The device also has a single and dual user mode so it can be shared by two people. In dual user mode, the frown is split into two and each half is a separate reminder for each person. If one person doesn't floss, the other will know. Talk about peer pressure!To make flossing fun for kids and teens, Flosstime also comes with cute animal snap-ons. If not used everyday, the animal's eyes glow warning lights to remind kids to floss! 
The three original trio includes Croakersby, Goldy and Siriby. Stay tuned for fun new snap-ons!
Meet Mr. Jack-o-Flossome!Here we describe in detail the lighting sequence for Single and Dual User modes:a) In the Single User mode, you can press on either side of the front face to activate Flosstime, which results in blue glowing lights around the ""spout"" and the dispensing of 18"" of floss. In theDual User mode, each user is assigned to either the left or the right side of the front face. Pressing the right side, in this case, will activate the floss for User 2.b) After the floss has been dispensed, blue-glowing quadrants that move clockwise around the circular light ring indicate how long the user should floss the teeth each quadrant of their mouth. Upon completion, Flosstime will light up with a blue smile.c) If not used daily, orange warning lights will glow to warn the user that it is time to floss. In theSingle User mode, a full frown will appear. In the Dual User mode, each user gets a separate timing sequence and only his/her side will glow.Why floss?Research shows that lack of flossing can lead to gum and periodontal diseases. They have been linked to heart problems, diabetes and numerous other serious medical issues. Bacteria build-up in between your teeth and gum pockets can enter the bloodstream and cause long term cardiovascular complications. In fact, one study shows that daily flossing can add up to more than 6 years to your life!Reproduced from http://www.sharonalbrightdds.com/assets/perio-poster.jpg""...people with gingivitis and periodontitis have a mortality rate that is 23 percent to 46 percent higher than those who don't"" Dr. Roisen M.D. author of ""RealAge""""When it comes to your health, flossing your teeth is more important than brushing."" Tracy Brown, WebMD""...research shows that good oral care can prevent heart disease, diabetes and even dementia.""Simon Usborne, The Independent""Flossing your teeth, experts say, may do more to fight the effects of aging — at least over the long-term — than plastic surgery."" Lisa Zamosky, NBC News*Crab face is only representative; you can choose any combinations of animal snap-ons of your choice.The StoryHi there, meet the Flosstime team!

The RFID technology that allows them to function is not entirely secure and can be accessed by scanning devices that are freely available online. VAULTCARD™ is a credit-card-sized tool, which can be placed inside a wallet to block electromagnetic signals – guaranteeing protection against RFID theft, while still enabling the use of contactless payments. RFID stands for Radio-Frequency Identification Technology. A small chip and an antenna relay information from credit and debit cards to contactless scanners, serving the same purpose as a barcode or magnetic strip on the back of a card. Contactless payment cards are convenient as they don’t need to be in direct contact with the scanner to work and don’t require a PIN or signature. However, the long-range nature of the technology enables an RFID chip to be read from up to 20 feet away with a high-powered skimming device – compromising personal data. Where RFID is usedRFID technology is used everywhere, from retail to banking, and across a variety of documents from identity cards to driving licenses. Most countries use RFID chips in passports, while several cities use the technology in public transport passes – London’s Oyster card is a key example. In addition, many businesses use RFID building access cards. Almost all credit and debit cards now carry contactless technology, which is also referred to as ExpressPay (American Express), payWave (Visa), PayPass (MasterCard), and Zip (Discover).In addition, most RFID enabled credit or debit cards will carry the following sign:Dangers of RFID technologyRFID enabled cards undoubtedly save time for consumers and organisations, but as they have become more common around the globe, significant security concerns have also emerged. Criminals can easily acquire equipment capable of accessing the data stored on your cards or passports from several metres away. Fraudsters can utilise this data to replicate credit cards, steal identities, or access secure buildings.   As awareness of RFID fraud has grown, an array of products have attempted to address security concerns. Most products are based on the principle of shielding the RFID card from electromagnetic waves by using metal foils. Yet this approach is susceptible to flaws due to the way electromagnetic waves travel. To ensure full protection, cards must be fully wrapped in steel foil with no gaps – but this is almost impossible to achieve. A typical wallet with metallic shielding can therefore only protect against low power reading devices and not at all angles.VAULTCARD™ to the RescueVAULTCARD™ is a revolutionary product designed to solve these issues by protecting against all RFID skimming devices. When placed inside a wallet, or kept in a pocket alongside credit cards, the VAULTCARD™ device ensures absolute data safety. In fact, the higher the strength of the skimming equipment, the stronger VAULTCARD’s jamming signal will be – protecting you from even the most powerful of machines. VAULTCARD switches on automatically when it senses an electromagnetic wave emitted by an RFID scanner. It responds to signal strengths one hundred times smaller than those required for contactless cards to function, and creates a sophisticated electromagnetic jamming signal that blocks RFID readers. VAULTCARD's patent pending RFID protection technology is unique to contactless card safety devices and is based on highly sophisticated jamming signals frequently used by the military.We have invested a great deal of time in research and development to create our final VAULTCARD™ prototype. Its unmatched protection utilises an extremely efficient design, which emits a complex jamming signal that completely shuts out any RFID communication.We have summarised the key pros and cons of the most widely used RFID protection methods. As you can see, several products offer shielding but none are design focused, and they are generally not effective against powerful skimming devices. VAULTCARD™ provides secure protection while allowing you to keep your existing wallet that you know and love. Here are the key benefits that make VAULTCARD™ so unique: Place VAULTCARD™ in the middle of your wallet. All RFID enabled cards will be protected within 1.6 inches (4cm) of the VAULTCARD™, and cards can be placed on either side, offering protection inside wallets up to 8cm thick.Contactless cards can still be used to pay for transactions in the normal way – just be sure the VAULTCARD™ is held 8 inches (20cm) away when making payments.  We have spent many months on research, development and prototyping of VAULTCARD™. Many of the prototypes were discarded, but several marked important milestones and mini breakthroughs until we reached the final product. The key components of the VAULTCARD are the receiving and transmitting antennas and the jamming signal generator. Receiving antenna harnesses energy from RFID scanner. The stored energy is then used to power up the jamming signal generator and the transmitter circuitry. The resulting jamming signal is emitted by the transmitting antenna.  EFFICIENT ENERGY HARNESSINGIn addition to a highly sophisticated jamming signal, VAULTCARD™ is extremely efficient in harnessing electromagnetic energy emitted by RFID scanners. This allows VAULTCARD™ to retransmit 1,000 times more power than RFID payment cards. The table below represents laboratory test results of VAULTCARD™ and a typical RFID enabled credit card. For test purposes we used a popular 250mW NFC scanner with electric E-field shielded antenna (so the scanner only working mainly with magnetic H-field of Electromagnetic Field, diameter of magnetic antenna 45mm). POWER LINEARITYAnother feature of VAULTCARD™ is that its emitted power is directly proportionate to the power of the scanning device, unlike RFID enabled credit cards. This guarantees that VAULTCARD™ stays extremely effective even against high-powered skimming devices. OUTSTANDING PROTECTION IN NEAR FIELDDue to the form factor of an antenna embedded in the credit card, RFID scanner and VAULTCARD™, the most critical area is the so-called near field zone (within 0-3 inches between credit card and RFID reader). Our team has focused on ensuring that VAULTCARD™ can be used not only against far field scanning devices, but is also extremely effective in the near field. We have launched this Indiegogo campaign to raise awareness of VAULTCARD™ and to give consumers a unique opportunity to pre-order at a discounted rate.

Subscribe to the Newsletter and get $30 off the iTraq+ price. iTraq+ is a hybrid (Cellular+GPS) tracking device - the world’s first global location device that can be found anywhere in the world where cellular service exists.  The iTraq+ has the added features of being rechargeable and, in addition to cellular tracking technology, includes enhanced GPS tracking to offer more precise location information whenever needed.  Many location devices use Bluetooth wireless technology which limits their use to finding things within the house  such as lost keys, remote controls, etc.Other location devices use GPS modules (Global Positioning System), which cannot be found when inside a building.iTraq+ provides a hybrid approach, which covers the globe and sees through buildings by using Cellular technology (Cell-ID). It also has the ability to switch to GPS for accurate location reading when necessary.Simply attach iTraq+ to a bicycle or boat, place it in the pocket of your child, or even attach it to your luggage, and find it even if your bags traveled to another country or continent. Most of the time iTraq+ uses cell towers to calculate its location. This determines where your device is located within a city block, while remaining in the low power consumption mode. It will be sufficient to understand if your child is at school or on a football field, or if your car is at home or some place across the city. Only when you have lost your valuable do your switch to GPS mode and receive an exact location based on satellite data.This approach gives you the best of both worlds - reach with low energy of Cell-ID technology and the accuracy of GPS.Thus, you can track you assets for a long time and find them with several meter accuracy when needed. As a user you control how long the device will survive until it will require recharging. Mainly it depends on how frequently your device will report its location.Reporting locations utilizing Cell-ID technology once a day will keep your battery alive for up to one year.  If you enable additional GPS module or increase the frequency of reports, it will decrease the battery life.Don't worry though - recharging is simple - just place iTraq+ on top of iTraq+ Wireless Charger and your device will soon be charged again. Most other location tracking devices are bulky, which make them hard to carry or hide in a tight spot.iTraq+ is as small as a credit card, only slightly thicker. It can be placed in the glove compartment of the car, remain hidden under the seat of your mountain bike, or tuck discretely into the secret compartment of a purse. Proprietary software allows  iTraq+ to stay in sleep mode most of the time - this helps to minimize energy consumption and achieve an amazing battery life.Based on the user defined schedule, iTraq+ wakes up, determines its location by scanning cellular towers in range and transmits data to the server.During the same communication session (if needed)  iTraq+ will use the GPS module and send its satellite based location data.All the location information is displayed on your mobile phone or on the website.  For each iTraq+ you can:
View the map that contains its location history with time stamps
Define the schedule of location reports - how frequently do you want it to wake up and report its location
Define Guard Zone
Switch to Panic Mode
See the remaining battery life and number of remaining location reports
You can always change the schedule, rename the device, re-define Guard Zone or turn off Panic Mode. In many cases it’s important not only to know where the iTraq+ is but to be alerted if it has been removed from the designated area (for example, a child left the house after hours). Define your Guard Zone by specifying the radius on the map and once the iTraq+ leaves it, you will receive an alert on the mobile phone. You can also be alerted when the device is back in the Guard Zone. Panic Mode means that you lost your asset and want to get its location as precise as possible. Panic Mode turns on the GPS module and suppliments Cell ID based location data with Satellite location data.Please note that your iTraq+ will switch to Panic Mode during the next scheduled communication session (not when you pressed the button).There are two ways to enable Panic Mode:
By pressing Panic button in your iTraq Mobile App
By selecting ""Switch to Panic Mode when outside the Guard Zone"" setting. In this case the device will automatically enable Panic Mode once it wakes up outside the Guard Zone.
 Every iTraq+ will come with 1000 location reports pre-loaded. Since iTraq+ is a rechargeable device, you can keep using it for as long as you need. Once you use your location reports you can buy additional reports using the iTraq Mobile App.*** Every customer who pledged for the original version of iTraq will receive a free upgrade to iTraq+ and it will come with 1500 location reports. ***

Each CablePower power bank is rated to last 2,000 life cycles vs only 500 cycles of the closest competitors. This means CablePower has a 5 years+ battery life, which means you can use it every single day for 5 years and it would still seem like its brand new.Through laboratory testing equipment, we've tested the battery to last 1,836 cycles and still have a capacity above 87% (a life cycle is considered above 80%), so in reality the life cycle is far greater than 2,000 but we are being conservative in our statement of 2,000.World's SafestIn order to make the process of charge/recharge more secure, CablePower supports 9 charging protections by means of multiple rigorous tests, providing safety protection comprehensively to let you use it at ease!Not only fast and powerful, the battery technology also makes CablePower the world’s safest power bank by allowing it to fast charge at low temperatures compared to standard batteries. It will never go above 50°C (122°F) unlike competitor power banks which can reach 70°C (167°F) ensuring it is safer and also longer lasting.  You'll feel very comfortable knowing that this baby won't heat up or bulge over time like you see in many of your older USB devices.Pocket-sizedSlim enough to fit in pockets and easily grab with one hand.Despite all the features, CablePower comes in a pocket-sized lightweight 270g (0.6lb) so you can carry the only battery that matters, that can power all your devices, wherever you go, away from the grid, without fear of ever losing power ensuring your life stays uninterrupted and always on the go. Durable And ComfortableWhile designing a high capacity battery, we still wanted a highly compact and portable solution. Adopting an ultra-hard PC shell and a surface made of matte, CablePower takes the comfortable hand feeling as well as the fine heat dissipation into account, characterizing anti-corrosion, scratch-resistance and a longer service life!CertificationIn order to achieve international certification for safe use, all power banks are put through a number of rigorous industrial tests to ensure CablePower can withstand daily use, even the most extreme of circumstances.Why Choose CablePowerSpecifications:

<p>To our generous supporters,</p>
<p>On behalf of everyone involved with Link, I want to extend a
heartfelt thank you to those of you who have supported our campaign so far. It
is truly incredibly to think that of all the ideas and campaigns you could
support, you chose to back ours. </p>
<p>Link will forever change the way people carry, stream and
share data. It will break down the barriers of current methods and truly enable
communication without limitations. This is no small feat and we feel a great
sense of responsibility to provide the best device we possibly can. That is why
we’ve chosen to end this current campaign.</p>
<p>We want to assure you, our supporters, and anyone else who
may learn about us in the coming weeks and months that we are fully committed
to developing and launching Link. In the time since we launched our campaign,
we’ve been working tirelessly to spread the message and have received some
early feedback from experts in the field that we respect and trust, and from
you – our supporters. This was always a part of our original game plan and it
has proven to be more valuable than we could have predicted.</p>
<p>Thanks to this feedback, we’ve decided that we need to hit the pause button for a bit to ensure we are creating
the best version of Link we possibly can. We are not slowing down; in fact,
closing this campaign gives us the time to perfect the technology, iron out any
potentially issues and make the most visually appealing device we can. With that in mind, we ask you to

and answer a few brief questions at the end. Your input will directly impact
Link’s new look and feel.</p>
<p>We will be launching a new IndieGoGo campaign in October and
there will be no stopping us from reaching our goal to bring Link to the
masses. We are so excited to share this technology with the world and your
early support means so much to us. </p>
<p>We will update this page when our new launch date is
official. A sincere thanks again for everything. Please feel free to reach out
to me directly if you have any questions or feedback – I truly do value your
opinion. </p>
<p>Thanks and best,</p>

</div></div>","To our generous supporters,
On behalf of everyone involved with Link, I want to extend a
heartfelt thank you to those of you who have supported our campaign so far. It
is truly incredibly to think that of all the ideas and campaigns you could
support, you chose to back ours. 
Link will forever change the way people carry, stream and
share data. It will break down the barriers of current methods and truly enable
communication without limitations. This is no small feat and we feel a great
sense of responsibility to provide the best device we possibly can. That is why
we’ve chosen to end this current campaign.
We want to assure you, our supporters, and anyone else who
may learn about us in the coming weeks and months that we are fully committed
to developing and launching Link. In the time since we launched our campaign,
we’ve been working tirelessly to spread the message and have received some
early feedback from experts in the field that we respect and trust, and from
you – our supporters. This was always a part of our original game plan and it
has proven to be more valuable than we could have predicted.
Thanks to this feedback, we’ve decided that we need to hit the pause button for a bit to ensure we are creating
the best version of Link we possibly can. We are not slowing down; in fact,
closing this campaign gives us the time to perfect the technology, iron out any
potentially issues and make the most visually appealing device we can. With that in mind, we ask you to
visit this questionnaire to rate the 20 designs we’re considering
and answer a few brief questions at the end. Your input will directly impact
Link’s new look and feel.
We will be launching a new IndieGoGo campaign in October and
there will be no stopping us from reaching our goal to bring Link to the
masses. We are so excited to share this technology with the world and your
early support means so much to us. 
We will update this page when our new launch date is
official. A sincere thanks again for everything. Please feel free to reach out
to me directly if you have any questions or feedback – I truly do value your
opinion. 
Thanks and best,
Coy Christmas, Co-Founder & CEO

Everything worthwhile starts with an idea. Thinking Ball is a ball specially designed for thinking of ideas. When you're ready to begin thinking, bounce the ball. This helps you have better ideas.


 Download the press kit here.
THE HOW
Thinking Ball is proven by science. The science is called kinesthetic learning. It has a Wikipedia page.
Kinesthetic learning means using your whole body when you think. By bouncing the ball, you engage the most advanced, fastest part of your brain.


To catch a bouncing Thinking Ball, your brain has to guess where the ball is going to land. Your brain also has to make your muscles move your hand where the ball is going to land. 


The muscle moving part of your brain does calculus. Really. 
That part of your brain is much faster than the part that makes words. If you were going to do that math with the talking part of your brain, it would take hours or even days.

 

But your kinesthetic brain can think of it many times each second. The Thinking Ball activates your whole brain when you're working to have ideas. Both the fast part and the slow part.
THE WHAT
Thinking Ball is a ball. It is the size of exactly one Thinking Ball. It is made from 100% Thinking Ball material. It is coated in a long-lasting Thinking Ball coating. One Thinking Ball will last for dozens or even trillions of ideas. Depending on what you call an idea.

<p><br/>We now need to purchase expensive tooling and build a global supply chain to bring the AMPL SmartBackpack to life. Your contribution will help us finance the fixed costs of ramping up production, and meet the minimum order quantities for raw materials.  <br/></p>
<h2><b>Risks and Challenges</b></h2>
<div>
<p></p>
<p>The AMPL team has brought new products into development many times before, and we are confident that we can produce the SmartBackpack. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">While we have worked hard in the design phase to mitigate them, there are ongoing risks associated with product development that could prevent us from delivering the product as planned. We will closely manage these risks until the final product is manufactured, tested and delivered to you. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p>First, there is always a risk of delay caused by unforeseen design or development issues. We will be optimizing the design to improve product performance and manufacturability, and while those modifications are accounted for in the schedule they could still introduce delays. </p>
<p>Additionally, the construction of AMPL SmartBackpack relies on assembly of parts coming from multiple supply chains. Unforeseen delays in any of these component supply-chains might cause a delay to the final assembly of the finished bags.  </p>
<p>Also, while we have budgeted for the final phase of the product development process, significant cost overruns could cause delays or impact our ability to deliver the final product as specified. We will manage costs closely, and multi-source as many components as possible to ensure that we do not run into a situation where expenses climb substantially over budget. </p>
<p>Finally, there is risk of delay caused by the certification process for this first-of-its-kind product. If regulators believe that we do not fit within a pre-existing category or class of goods, there may be delays while they create a new category for the SmartBackpack. To mitigate this risk we will engage with them early in the final development process.</p>

<br/><h3>Power Questions</h3>
<p><b><a name=""Q1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Q1:   How much battery
power does the bag come with?<br/></b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A1:
  The AMPL SmartBackpack has one 18.5Wh
internal SmartBattery that can charge a smartphone up to 3 times, or a small
tablet once. You can add up to three modular expansion SmartBatteries (sold
separately) to power more devices including tablets, laptops or almost anything
you would normally plug into the wall.</span></p>
</div><div>
<p><b><a name=""Q2"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Q2:  What expansion
SmartBattery modules are available?</b><br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A2:  There is an 18.5Wh TabletBoost module
($59) that can charge USB devices, a 55Wh LaptopBoost module ($139) that can
charge most PC laptops and a 55Wh LaptopBoost module with SmartInverter ($179)
that can charge MacBooks and almost anything else you would normally plug into
the wall.</span></p>
<p><b><a name=""Q3"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Q3:  Are there any
limitations on how many of each SmartBattery module can be installed into the bag?</b><br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A3:  The AMPL SmartBackpack has a total of
3 SmartBattery docking bays: one inside the front-top pocket, one inside the
front-bottom pocket and one inside the rear laptop compartment. The front-top
pocket only supports the TabletBoost module only, which has a
smaller form-factor. The other docking bays will accept any SmartBattery module. So the
maximum configuration would be two LaptopBoost modules and one TabletBoost
module.</span></p>
<p><b><a name=""Q4"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Q4:  How long does it
take to recharge the SmartBatteries?</b><br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A4:  AMPL SmartBatteries feature
fast-charging technology from Qnovo which monitors conditions inside the battery in
real-time and adjusts the charging rate accordingly. This intelligent adaptive
charging enables them to recharge more than twice as fast as traditional Li-Ion
batteries while also doubling their expected useful lifetime by reducing
degradation caused while charging. The batteries can charge from 0-80% in about an hour. </span></p>
<p><b><a name=""Q5"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Q5:  How do I charge
the batteries in the bag?</b><br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A5:  There is integrated AC adapter housed
in a specialized pocket in the bag. It will charge all SmartBatteries docked
into the bag, as well as all connected laptops and USB devices, using an
intelligent prioritization algorithm to efficiently route power to every device.
Plug in all your gear and the bag will change everything over-night through a
single power cable.</span></p>
<p><b><a name=""Q6"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Q6:  Does the SmartBackpack
charge all cell phones?</b><br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A6:  Yes, any cell phone or device that utilizes
a 5V USB port can be charged.</span></p>
<p><b><a name=""Q7"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Q7:  Will the SmartBackpack charge my
laptop?</b><br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A7:  The optional LaptopBoost SmartBattery
module will charge most PC laptops through a direct DC output and the correct
adapter tip for your laptop model. And you can charge a Macbook (or almost
anything else you would normally plug into the wall) via the A/C outlet on the SmartInverter
attachment to the LaptopBoost battery module.</span></p>
<p><b><a name=""Q8"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Q8:  Will it harm the battery if I charge
it before it is completely empty?</b><br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A8:  Actually, it is best to recharge
batteries when they have between 20-80% remaining power. Our SmartBatteries protect the health of the battery by regulating the charging intensity based on
real-time feedback of how the battery is performing, regardless of the charge
level.  Most battery degradation occurs
during charging, and by applying a more intelligent charging process the damage
can be minimized.</span></p>
<p><b><a name=""Q9"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Q9:  Is it harmful to
charge overnight?</b><br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A9:  No, the
batteries will stop drawing power from the SmartBackpack when fully charged.</span></p>
<p><b><a name=""Q10"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Q10:  Will the SmartBatteries get hot when charging?</b><br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A10:  They could get warm, but should not get hot.
Temperature will increase if a laptop or other devices is left on while
charging, but our App will alert you if any devices begin to overheat. The
design of the bag also includes vents which help maintain safe internal bag
temperature.</span></p>
<p><b><a name=""Q11"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Q11:  Will my phone charge faster using your
fast charging technology?</b><br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A11:  No, AMPL SmartBatteries will charge faster when docked into the bag, so they can store power very quickly. But your phone will charge at same rate it always does – you just
won’t have to be plugged into the wall the whole time. All USB ports support
2.1 amp charging current.</span></p>
<p><b><a name=""Q12"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Q12:
  What is difference between milliamp-hours
(mAh) and watt-hours(Wh)?</b><br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A12:  An amp (A) or milliamp (mA) is a measure
of electrical current. A watt (W) is a measure of energy (for DC power in a
battery, Watt = 1 Volt * 1 Amp). Therefore, watt-hours (Wh) tells you how much total
energy a battery can provide for 1 hour, while milliamp-hours (mAh) tell you
only how much current can be provided for 1 hour. Different battery
configurations will have different voltages, so watt-hours (Wh) is the more
comparable unit of measure between different batteries.</span></p>
<p><b><a name=""Q13"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Q13:  How do I know which battery to use to
charge each of my devices ?</b><br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A13:  For USB devices, you don't need to worry
about which battery to plug into, the bag will aggregate all the power from all
the batteries and route it to any of the 6 USB outlets accessible from every
pocket. The bag will create a charging “playlist” of all
connected devices and efficiently charge everything in order, as many at a time
as possible. You can always reprioritize the playlist order using the mobile
app on your phone, tablet or computer.</span></p>
<p><b><a name=""Q14"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Q14:  How many devices can I charge simultaneously?</b><br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A14:
  It depends on how many AMPL
SmartBatteries you have installed in the bag, and the power requirements of the
devices you are trying to charge.  As a
general rule, the internal SmartBattery in the bag can charge 1 or 2 device at a
time, and each additional modular battery installed increases the number of
devices that can be charged simultaneously by 1.</span></p>
<p><b><a name=""Q15"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Q15:  Does the AMPL
SmartBackpack have pass-through charging?</b><br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A15:  Yes, Batteries and devices can be
charged simultaneously when plugged into AC power. The charge priority system
will allow you to select the order in which devices charge.</span></p>
<p><b><a name=""Q16"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Q16:  Can I charge the SmartBackpack through
USB?</b><br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A17:  No the internal SmartBattery in the AMPL
SmartBackpack must be charged using the integrated AC adapter. The optional
TabletBoost expansion module can be charged via USB, but fast-charging is only
active when the modular batteries are docked into the bag and charged using the
integrated AC adapter.</span></p>
<p><b><a name=""Q17"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Q17:  Do I need an A/C inverter to charge my
laptop or other devices?</b><br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A17:  Most PC laptops can be charged directly
from the LaptopBoost SmartBattery without the use of an inverter. However MacBooks
and any other PC laptops that aren’t supported by direct DC charging can be charged using the optional AC SmartInverter module that
attaches to the LaptopBoost battery.<br/></span></p>

SmartBackpack Features




Do you ever worry about running out of power in your phone, tablet or laptop? 

And do you struggle with the mess of plugs and cords required to recharge your gadgets every day?


The AMPL SmartBackpack can recharge all your devices, from a single power cable. Keep your gear charged and ready to go. 

Then when you need a boost throughout the day, it can recharge your gadgets anywhere by intelligently routing power from multiple modular batteries to USB outlets in every pocket. 


And yes, it can even charge your laptop with the optional LaptopBoost battery.




Easy access to 6 USB Outlets
You can access USB ports in every pocket, and the convenient smartphone charging-holster on the shoulder strap. 




Modular SmartBatteries
The internal 18.5Wh SmartBattery packs enough power to recharge a smartphone up to 3 times, or a small tablet once. There are also docking bays that accommodate up to three (3) additional SmartBoost expansion modules. 


All AMPL SmartBatteries incorporate innovative adaptive fast-charging technology from Qnovo that constantly monitors the condition of the battery and adjusts the charging rate accordingly. As a result, AMPL SmartBatteries charge 2.5 times faster when docked into the bag, and last twice as long as batteries employing conventional constant-rate charging. You get the best of both worlds! 


AMPL SmartBatteries work together when docked into the bag, so you don't need to worry about how much power is left in each battery. And they can also be removed and used separately as a standalone charger, so you don't have to take the bag with you to have that backup power.  


Have you ever forgotten your bag at home in the morning when you left for work or school? Have you ever accidentally left it at a coffee shop?



The AMPL SmartBackpack will alert you if you do. When the Bluetooth connection between the bag and your phone is lost, you will be notified that either,1. you left your bag behind, or 2. it is leaving without you... 
Monitor your gear without opening a zipper
SmartSensors in the bag keep tabs on battery levels, power flows, operating conditions and temperature. You can monitor and control everything from the AMPL mobile app. 








Do you ever worry about whether your expensive portable electronics are safe inside your current bag? 
The AMPL SmartBackpack has shock-absorbers integrated into its lightweight but durable bottom sole that protect all the electronics in the bag from accidental drops. 





And a water-resistant coating on the exterior fabrics helps keep the rain out. 



Do you ever struggle with compartments of your bag that just aren't quite the right size to hold your gadgets? 



With 7 main storage compartments, including a hanging tablet pocket and a universal smartphone holster on the shoulder-strap, you'll have a place for everything.   
    
And the adjustable laptop compartment form fits to almost any-sized laptop and allows easy access from the side, or the top. 

Plus the TSA-friendly lay-flat laptop compartment and integrated trolly handle pass-through make traveling with your SmartBackpack a breeze.

Current State of Product Development


We've custom designed the backpack, batteries and all of the smart-power electronics, and built 4-rounds of prototypes over the last 18-months. We have a working proof-of-concept and have completed our evaluation and testing of the initial designs. 



We now need to purchase expensive tooling and build a global supply chain to bring the AMPL SmartBackpack to life. Your contribution will help us finance the fixed costs of ramping up production, and meet the minimum order quantities for raw materials.  
Risks and Challenges


The AMPL team has brought new products into development many times before, and we are confident that we can produce the SmartBackpack. While we have worked hard in the design phase to mitigate them, there are ongoing risks associated with product development that could prevent us from delivering the product as planned. We will closely manage these risks until the final product is manufactured, tested and delivered to you. 

First, there is always a risk of delay caused by unforeseen design or development issues. We will be optimizing the design to improve product performance and manufacturability, and while those modifications are accounted for in the schedule they could still introduce delays. 
Additionally, the construction of AMPL SmartBackpack relies on assembly of parts coming from multiple supply chains. Unforeseen delays in any of these component supply-chains might cause a delay to the final assembly of the finished bags.  
Also, while we have budgeted for the final phase of the product development process, significant cost overruns could cause delays or impact our ability to deliver the final product as specified. We will manage costs closely, and multi-source as many components as possible to ensure that we do not run into a situation where expenses climb substantially over budget. 
Finally, there is risk of delay caused by the certification process for this first-of-its-kind product. If regulators believe that we do not fit within a pre-existing category or class of goods, there may be delays while they create a new category for the SmartBackpack. To mitigate this risk we will engage with them early in the final development process.


About AMPL

AMPL is a talented team of product designers, engineers and marketers with decades of experience developing and launching innovative new products for some really big companies. We are excited to now have the opportunity to launch one of our own.

Power Questions
Q1:   How much battery
power does the bag come with?A1:
  The AMPL SmartBackpack has one 18.5Wh
internal SmartBattery that can charge a smartphone up to 3 times, or a small
tablet once. You can add up to three modular expansion SmartBatteries (sold
separately) to power more devices including tablets, laptops or almost anything
you would normally plug into the wall.

Q2:  What expansion
SmartBattery modules are available?A2:  There is an 18.5Wh TabletBoost module
($59) that can charge USB devices, a 55Wh LaptopBoost module ($139) that can
charge most PC laptops and a 55Wh LaptopBoost module with SmartInverter ($179)
that can charge MacBooks and almost anything else you would normally plug into
the wall.
Q3:  Are there any
limitations on how many of each SmartBattery module can be installed into the bag?A3:  The AMPL SmartBackpack has a total of
3 SmartBattery docking bays: one inside the front-top pocket, one inside the
front-bottom pocket and one inside the rear laptop compartment. The front-top
pocket only supports the TabletBoost module only, which has a
smaller form-factor. The other docking bays will accept any SmartBattery module. So the
maximum configuration would be two LaptopBoost modules and one TabletBoost
module.
Q4:  How long does it
take to recharge the SmartBatteries?A4:  AMPL SmartBatteries feature
fast-charging technology from Qnovo which monitors conditions inside the battery in
real-time and adjusts the charging rate accordingly. This intelligent adaptive
charging enables them to recharge more than twice as fast as traditional Li-Ion
batteries while also doubling their expected useful lifetime by reducing
degradation caused while charging. The batteries can charge from 0-80% in about an hour. 
Q5:  How do I charge
the batteries in the bag?A5:  There is integrated AC adapter housed
in a specialized pocket in the bag. It will charge all SmartBatteries docked
into the bag, as well as all connected laptops and USB devices, using an
intelligent prioritization algorithm to efficiently route power to every device.
Plug in all your gear and the bag will change everything over-night through a
single power cable.
Q6:  Does the SmartBackpack
charge all cell phones?A6:  Yes, any cell phone or device that utilizes
a 5V USB port can be charged.
Q7:  Will the SmartBackpack charge my
laptop?A7:  The optional LaptopBoost SmartBattery
module will charge most PC laptops through a direct DC output and the correct
adapter tip for your laptop model. And you can charge a Macbook (or almost
anything else you would normally plug into the wall) via the A/C outlet on the SmartInverter
attachment to the LaptopBoost battery module.
Q8:  Will it harm the battery if I charge
it before it is completely empty?A8:  Actually, it is best to recharge
batteries when they have between 20-80% remaining power. Our SmartBatteries protect the health of the battery by regulating the charging intensity based on
real-time feedback of how the battery is performing, regardless of the charge
level.  Most battery degradation occurs
during charging, and by applying a more intelligent charging process the damage
can be minimized.
Q9:  Is it harmful to
charge overnight?A9:  No, the
batteries will stop drawing power from the SmartBackpack when fully charged.
Q10:  Will the SmartBatteries get hot when charging?A10:  They could get warm, but should not get hot.
Temperature will increase if a laptop or other devices is left on while
charging, but our App will alert you if any devices begin to overheat. The
design of the bag also includes vents which help maintain safe internal bag
temperature.
Q11:  Will my phone charge faster using your
fast charging technology?A11:  No, AMPL SmartBatteries will charge faster when docked into the bag, so they can store power very quickly. But your phone will charge at same rate it always does – you just
won’t have to be plugged into the wall the whole time. All USB ports support
2.1 amp charging current.
Q12:
  What is difference between milliamp-hours
(mAh) and watt-hours(Wh)?A12:  An amp (A) or milliamp (mA) is a measure
of electrical current. A watt (W) is a measure of energy (for DC power in a
battery, Watt = 1 Volt * 1 Amp). Therefore, watt-hours (Wh) tells you how much total
energy a battery can provide for 1 hour, while milliamp-hours (mAh) tell you
only how much current can be provided for 1 hour. Different battery
configurations will have different voltages, so watt-hours (Wh) is the more
comparable unit of measure between different batteries.
Q13:  How do I know which battery to use to
charge each of my devices ?A13:  For USB devices, you don't need to worry
about which battery to plug into, the bag will aggregate all the power from all
the batteries and route it to any of the 6 USB outlets accessible from every
pocket. The bag will create a charging “playlist” of all
connected devices and efficiently charge everything in order, as many at a time
as possible. You can always reprioritize the playlist order using the mobile
app on your phone, tablet or computer.
Q14:  How many devices can I charge simultaneously?A14:
  It depends on how many AMPL
SmartBatteries you have installed in the bag, and the power requirements of the
devices you are trying to charge.  As a
general rule, the internal SmartBattery in the bag can charge 1 or 2 device at a
time, and each additional modular battery installed increases the number of
devices that can be charged simultaneously by 1.
Q15:  Does the AMPL
SmartBackpack have pass-through charging?A15:  Yes, Batteries and devices can be
charged simultaneously when plugged into AC power. The charge priority system
will allow you to select the order in which devices charge.
Q16:  Can I charge the SmartBackpack through
USB?A17:  No the internal SmartBattery in the AMPL
SmartBackpack must be charged using the integrated AC adapter. The optional
TabletBoost expansion module can be charged via USB, but fast-charging is only
active when the modular batteries are docked into the bag and charged using the
integrated AC adapter.
Q17:  Do I need an A/C inverter to charge my
laptop or other devices?A17:  Most PC laptops can be charged directly
from the LaptopBoost SmartBattery without the use of an inverter. However MacBooks
and any other PC laptops that aren’t supported by direct DC charging can be charged using the optional AC SmartInverter module that
attaches to the LaptopBoost battery.

Connectivity Questions

Q1:  How can I check battery levels and monitor smart-sensors?A1:  Two ways. A free mobile app will allow you to do all that and more, or you can quickly check vitals inside the bag using the OLED display and touch controls on the bag itself.  
Q2:  How does the mobile App communicate with the SmartBackpack?A2:  The AMPL SmartBackpack communicates via Bluetooth LE with the AMPL Mobile App to will allow you to monitor battery levels and SmartSensors or prioritize the charging playlist of devices connected to the bag. 

Backpack Questions
Q1:  Is the backpack
water resistant?A1:  Yes, all the exterior fabrics have
been lined with an advanced water resistant coating to help keep the rain out.
Q2:  How does the
AMPL SmartBackpack protect all my devices?A2:  A lightweight shock-absorbing bottom sole absorbs the
energy from the impact of drops, so your electronics don’t have to.
Q3:  Why did you add
a rubber sole? A3:  The rubber
sole comprises the structural endoskeleton
of the bag.  It keeps the bag up right so you
don’t have those annoying bag roll overs.  It also houses the air vents that allow the
bag to passively cool the charging electronics in the bag.
Q4:  What is the warranty?A4:  SmartBackpack: Limited Lifetime
warranty against manufacturer’s defects. All electronic devices: 1-year
warranty from the date of purchase.
Q5:  Do you have to register the product
for warranty to be valid?A5:  No, but if you do we can keep in
contact with you and send you information on new and discounted items that work with your SmartBackpack .
Q6:  What phones fit in the smartphone-charging
holster?A6:  The holster adjusts to custom-fit
phones of all sizes.
Q7:  What is the
largest laptop that will fit in your SmartBackpack?A7:  Maximum laptop size: 16.3” (height) x
11” (width) x 1.6” (depth). Most 17” laptops will fit, and the laptop
compartment is customizable to snugly fit smaller laptops.
Q8:  Is this SmartBackpack TSA friendly?A8:  Yes, the bag
will lie flat so you don’t have to remove your laptop while going through
security at the airport.",59.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Hi I’m Andy</strong></p>
<p>Hi I’m Andy AppBot!  I’m a little orange robot with big aspirations.  My dream is to take my place among the big video game heroes, like the Mario Brothers, and Sonic the Hedgehog.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t even be here though it weren’t for my creators David Robinson and Mark Wood.  Dave has made a couple of games for Android already and I’m just the product of his latest imaginations.  Dave knew that he needed some extra help though, you see he’s not an animator; mostly he’s a really good programmer with flare for the creative and a passion for games.</p>

<p>We have taken the results of years of eye-gaze tracking research published in  peer-reviewed journals, derived proprietary algorithms, and created a patented system with a mobile app, and laptop-based software.  It can begin to screen children for autism risk as early as 3-6 months old.</p>
<p><b>Results can be made more precise by repeating the test over several months, just as repeating a blood pressure check over time gives a more accurate  picture overall.</b></p>

</p>
<p><b>It does not replace formal diagnosis by a professional, which can only be done once a child is old enough to be clinically evaluated for Autism.</b></p>
<p>The first releases will be for laptops and iPad tablets. Other devices will then have versions released with the patented technology.</p>

<p> Through this campaign, you can get first access to the screening system, as well as internet and telephone-based support for test interpretation, counseling, and referral to local resources.  This is via an ongoing home-based clinical trial, which will be used to continue to gather data to further improve the system.  </p>
<p>It is important to understand that the tool gives a risk-assessment, and not a diagnosis.  It is also important to understand that the tool will undergo continual development and improvement over the next few years, as our datasets and systems grow.  <br/></p>
<p>You can either choose to get the tool for yourself, gift it to someone you know, or sponsor a child who would otherwise not be able to afford it to receive access. Here's how:</p>

<div style=""width: 100%;"">
<p>We seek to get it into your hands in six months, perhaps a bit earlier if possible.  At the same time, we realistically budget up to two months of delay, because that is the  nature of complex software releases.    We want to provide a solid and user-friendly experience, and sometimes that requires extra development time.<br/></p>
<p>We know you want results as soon as possible, and that drives us to deliver a top product, as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Access will be provided in several sequential group releases, in order of user signup.</p>
<p>The software currently has basic functionality, and requires further development for commercial release to be user-friendly.     A significant portion of our budget goes towards funding support (online plus telephone-based) to those whose results return as high-risk.</p>

What is NeuroscanPro?






If you are concerned that a child may be at an increased risk of  autism, it can be a continual worry to have to wait until they are old enough to begin formal evaluations and diagnosis.
NeuroscanPro’s screening tool has been developed to bring advanced, early autism screening technology into a mobile, practical, and accessible format.


When you're ready to know, we're here for you.




Early Detection is Key




No Early Detection Tools - Until Now


There have been no blood tests or scans available for Autism.
Diagnosis is based on behavior.
Diagnosis is often done from ages 2-5, and often later due to delays.








And yet, all therapists working with children with Autism prefer that they begin therapy as young as possible, as outcomes are better.
Further, new research shows that early treatment allows some children with Autism to recover and catch up to the level of independence of typical kids.

[1]
[1] Dr. Deborah Fine[2] Granpeesheh et al. Retrospective analysis of clinical records in 38 cases of recovery from autism. Ann Clin Psychiatry. 2009 



The Science is Sound




Over ten years of research in peer-reviewed journals has shown that by using video to accurately track what children look at, one can detect children who have autism, or who will later go on to be diagnosed with autism.







Who Developed and Uses this Sort of Approach?



A number of top thought leaders at major institutions around the world have developed the foundation for this approach for over a decade [3].  
[3] Bedford, Chawarska,  Elison, Elsabbagh, Falck-Ytter, Holmqvist, Hosozawa, Key/Stone, Klin/Jones, Noris, Pierce, Shic, Young, and more.
Dr. Ami Klin and Dr. Warren Jones are two of the thought leaders in the field, and direct research at the Marcus Autism Center in Atlanta, Georgia.   The center employs hundreds of staff for research and clinical care, and is a national Autism Center of Excellence.
Here is a 2-minute news report describing how the technology is being employed, with Dr. Jones commenting.

Please note, NeuroscanPro has not, to date, worked with or been affiliated with Dr. Klin, Dr. Jones, or the Marcus Autism Center, though like all researchers in the field, we are indebted to their groundbreaking research, as well as that of other renowned eye-tracking thought leaders mentioned.

Here is an excellent 20 minute TED presentation by Dr. Ami Klin on the background behind the eye-tracking approach.






And Now: A Simple, Quick, Mobile Solution






The Science  +  Mobile Devices =A Revolutionary Screening Capability


We have taken the results of years of eye-gaze tracking research published in  peer-reviewed journals, derived proprietary algorithms, and created a patented system with a mobile app, and laptop-based software.  It can begin to screen children for autism risk as early as 3-6 months old.
Results can be made more precise by repeating the test over several months, just as repeating a blood pressure check over time gives a more accurate  picture overall.
Initial users will need to use the app to take several readings over a three month period, before a risk assessment will be available.



Key Benefits








Our point-of-care technology is a revolutionary screening and monitoring tool that can flag infants at high-risk for future Autism diagnosis. 
It may also be used to objectively monitor how the child is doing, while different therapeutic interventions are tried in children who have already been diagnosed.  

It does not replace formal diagnosis by a professional, which can only be done once a child is old enough to be clinically evaluated for Autism.
The first releases will be for laptops and iPad tablets. Other devices will then have versions released with the patented technology.



Contributor Rewards




 Through this campaign, you can get first access to the screening system, as well as internet and telephone-based support for test interpretation, counseling, and referral to local resources.  This is via an ongoing home-based clinical trial, which will be used to continue to gather data to further improve the system.  
It is important to understand that the tool gives a risk-assessment, and not a diagnosis.  It is also important to understand that the tool will undergo continual development and improvement over the next few years, as our datasets and systems grow.  
You can either choose to get the tool for yourself, gift it to someone you know, or sponsor a child who would otherwise not be able to afford it to receive access. Here's how:








Project Plan & Use of funds




We seek to get it into your hands in six months, perhaps a bit earlier if possible.  At the same time, we realistically budget up to two months of delay, because that is the  nature of complex software releases.    We want to provide a solid and user-friendly experience, and sometimes that requires extra development time.
We know you want results as soon as possible, and that drives us to deliver a top product, as soon as possible.
Access will be provided in several sequential group releases, in order of user signup.
The software currently has basic functionality, and requires further development for commercial release to be user-friendly.     A significant portion of our budget goes towards funding support (online plus telephone-based) to those whose results return as high-risk.





What are people saying about us?












The Company Has Won Multiple Top Prizes






Our multi-award winning company (6 prestigious prizes in 2014) has a strategic partnership with a top 
academic children’s hospital for validation testing and technology trials.



The social impact will be huge



If our system succeeds in getting 10% of children on track to early treatment and recovery, we can 



save over $12 billion/year in the USA alone, and 



get over 1 million kids independent worldwide, over the next 25 years. 







Our Team




Our team has a combined 30 years of experience in delivering complex health-IT database solutions, to hundreds of clients around the world, including many of the top medical schools and hospitals.  We know how to deliver.



Our CEO has previously raised 7-figure venture capital and grants.  He founded a prior health database company (Evidence Matters) and sold it to a U.S.A public company for a successful exit for all stakeholders.

The team holds authorship on two health-tech patents involving motion detection.

I and a few other indie developers created what we like to call the <b>Bluish Lab,</b> and this is the story of our app, Cyan!</div><div>Now-a-days, our Facebook feeds are stuffed with sponsored posts, page promotions, celebrity videos and funny memes. Not only are we getting a lot of stories from people who we haven't subscribed to, but Facebook also uses an algorithm to demote a majority of our Friend's posts.<span style=""background-color: initial;""> I used to solve this issue by filtering in Friends' posts on the iPhone app, but FB decided to remove that too in a later update. This tingled our developer senses and instead of just leaving a poor review on the AppStore and waiting for FB to do something, we decided to act. We headed out to create Cyan.</span>
</div><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">We have been working on Cyan for the past 6 months, doing part-time jobs to fund the project. But now, we realize that in order to do full justice to the app, we need more resources, especially a dedicated UI designer and access to some third party services. And that is why we turned to Indiegogo for your help to make Cyan a reality.</span>

Super Fast - </b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">One of the AppStore user reviews for the Facebook app reads ""S-O-O-O-O S-L-O-W"". In fact, lag is one of the most complained features of the FB app and from the beginning, it has been one of our areas of focus. Thanks to the light-weight coding and a simplistic design, Cyan is upto 2 times faster than the official Facebook app, even on older devices.</span></p>

</div></div>","UPDATE: Yes, Cyan will be compatible with iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Our concepts for the same are is given below.Cyan For Facebook - What Is It?Cyan is the most powerful Facebook client for iPhone ever developed. Cyan is fast, intuitive and sports more than a dozen of the most demanded features, ranging from details as mild as 'reducing the number of taps to get things done' to powerful ones like 'support for Read it Later services such as Instapaper'. Scroll down to see the details of Cyan's features. (Our Website)

Our Story - What Are We Trying To Do?I am Roshan Daniel, a med student and part-time developer from India. I and a few other indie developers created what we like to call the Bluish Lab, and this is the story of our app, Cyan!Now-a-days, our Facebook feeds are stuffed with sponsored posts, page promotions, celebrity videos and funny memes. Not only are we getting a lot of stories from people who we haven't subscribed to, but Facebook also uses an algorithm to demote a majority of our Friend's posts. I used to solve this issue by filtering in Friends' posts on the iPhone app, but FB decided to remove that too in a later update. This tingled our developer senses and instead of just leaving a poor review on the AppStore and waiting for FB to do something, we decided to act. We headed out to create Cyan.

We have been working on Cyan for the past 6 months, doing part-time jobs to fund the project. But now, we realize that in order to do full justice to the app, we need more resources, especially a dedicated UI designer and access to some third party services. And that is why we turned to Indiegogo for your help to make Cyan a reality.


Features - Why Cyan?


1. Super Fast - One of the AppStore user reviews for the Facebook app reads ""S-O-O-O-O S-L-O-W"". In fact, lag is one of the most complained features of the FB app and from the beginning, it has been one of our areas of focus. Thanks to the light-weight coding and a simplistic design, Cyan is upto 2 times faster than the official Facebook app, even on older devices.




2. Intuitive - The elegant interface (beta) is flat and iOS-7 inspired, showing an increased use of white spaces and transparency. The actions are mostly gesture-based and we have significantly reduced the number of taps it takes to get things done.



3. Powerful - We literally spent weeks going through thousands of user reviews left at the AppStore for the Facebook app. We then shortlisted about 50 of the most demanded and practical features to be implemented in Cyan. The first release of Cyan will see over a dozen of these features with more coming in the later updates.



4. Filter your feed - Facebook's algorithm to sort the user's feeds has been widely critisized and when they removed the ability to sort Friends out of the feed, everybody started missing important stories. Cyan will bring back the ability to filter only posts from Friends or Pages. You can also create a custom group of friends and get a feed of just their stories.



5. Save for Later - Have you ever found a long blog post or a video in your feed which you really wanted to see but din't have the time to do so? Save for Later helps you with just that. You can Save certain stories and links either locally or to third party clients like Pocket, Readability and Instapaper, to read later.



6. Bookmark posts - Bookmarking is like a permanent save. For example, you find a post on ""Top ten places to visit before you die."" or a video on ""How to fix a frozen iPhone"" which you want to save forever and access in times of need. These Bookmarks can be sorted, tagged and are also searchable, for easy access.



7. Pin Friends or Pages to side bar - If you have a close friend or a business page or a favorite celebrity whom you closely follow, you can create a shortcut to their feeds by pinning them to the homescreen or sidebar. These icons can also show notifications when they posts something new.




8. Mute - Admit it, you have always had that one guy who always posts something annoying or offensive but you just can't unfriend him. With Cyan, you can just hit a Mute button to hide all his posts without him ever finding out. Not only friends, but pages and groups can also be muted.



9. Powerful search for feeds - Facebook app's search is great for finding people and fan pages, but finding stories are not that easy except for the limited tags. Cyan comes with a powerful search which can search through the feeds based on time, user, page and more.



10. iOS 8 ready - By the time Cyan is launched, iOS 8 would have already been rolled out but, Cyan won't be late to join the party. We're already working on some great iOS 8 features including interactive notifications, notification center widgets and app extensions.



11. Live in-app notifications - Thanks to Facebook's real-time APIs, Cyan will be able to give live notifications when users are within the app. These will be non-obtrusive banners on the top bar which can be either dismissed or opened to bring a pop-up story where you can quickly reply, like or comment without losing whatever you're doing.



12. Modes - Modes are something super exciting and exclusive to Cyan. Though we won't be able to give you the exact details of each at this time, we can assure that Cyan will come with a Driving mode, Exercise mode, Night mode, Kid's mode and a ""top secret"" mode.



13. More - In addition to the above mentioned features, minor additions like Password locking, multiple profiles, faster ways to consume feeds, powerful media controls and accessibility features will also make into Cyan.


  
What We Need?



We funded Cyan's development for the past 6 months by doing some freelancing and part-time jobs. But at this point, we realize that with the limited budget and slow pace, we wont be able to bring out Cyan as we visioned it to be. 

We need a couple more people to join us and also access to some third party resources to complete the app satisfactorily. Unfortunately these are out of our budget and that is why we decided to showcase the prototype of Cyan on Indiegogo. A detailed sheet of our estimated expenditures is given below.
If you liked what we're doing, back Cyan and share it with as many as you can.


What You'll Get?




Most importantly, you'll be contributing the development of a revolutionary app which you'll be proud to be a part of. Cyan is not just about the looks. It saves time, increases your productivity, keeps you closer with friend and family and even helps in managing your business pages.

Then of course, there are the perks! We have distributed our offerings across a range of $1 to $1000 and have made sure that whichever one you choose, you'll be getting the best value for your money. Even if you can't buy a perk, we'd really appreciate if you could spread the word about Cyan.;

  
Challenges and Estimates - How will we spend $7000?


1. UI/UX Designer - $3000
The major problem our team is currently facing is that we donot have a dedicated UI designer amongst us. The current UI is just bought from Envato Marketplace. You might have already noticed in the demo video and pictures that the interface is kind of glitchy.

These will be Cyan exclusive and you guys are gonna love it. We also need a developer to join our team to work on their implementation, for a short period of time. 
3. Hosting - $2000
We've been working with cheap and shared hostings to test Cyan during the developement period. However it has now become necessary to move to a more secure, private and larger capacity hosting facility. The money you back us with will host us through the next two months of developments and the first month after release.
What if we fall short of the target?
As a buyer, it is important for you to know what happens to your money if the campaign doesn't meet its goal.
If we do manage to get a significant funding, we plan to move forward with the development but Cyan will be lacking some key features, at least to start with.
Else, we will either refund you or can donate to charity whichever you choose.

Gateway. (<i>Your</i> <i>Personal
Entertainment Link</i>) will allow you to watch free TV broadcasts, ""Pay
Per View"" movies or Live Events on your smart phone, Tablet, PC or later
on a Bluetooth enabled Smart TV!</p>
<p>  The ""PEEK"" Gateway is a cell phone
Gateway that enables you to connect to the  Aboo network to view broadcasts of
participating local TV stations , movies, and live events carried by the ""ABoo
Worldwide Network” on most cel phones or your home computer. The
""PEEK"" System delivers a super sharp picture and sound on Apple
products and most Android devices.</p>
<p><b>  The “PEEK”
Gateway and the ABoo Entertainment Network are being developed by the broadcast
engineers of KCTU TV,  the first
Commercial television station to broadcast 24/7 on the worldwide web. The top
broadcast news publications have acknowleged this with articles published
worldwide.  With a combined total of over
100 years of experience in broadcast, program acquisition, marketing, digital
development and production our engineers have developed the next step in on-
line broadcast,</b> <b>The “PEEK” Aboo Personal entertainment system”!  It’s kinda like the streaming service you currently
use, but on steroids</b>.</p>
<p>  The ""PEEK"" Gateway will be offered
Worldwide on most App Store sites and cell phone retailers for only $24.95 U.S.
Upon purchase the Gateway can be downloaded directly to the licensed device.
Television broadcasts from affiliated stations and networks will be available to
licensed clients Free, while "" Pay Per View"" selections and special
events will cost a reasonable fee payable thru PayPal right on the
""PEEK"" Gateway. </p>
<p>  All Broadcast stations and networks
available using the ""PEEK"" Gateway will be legally licensed for
retransmission of the programming by the ""ABoo Worldwide Network"".
Stations located in Oklahoma City, Dallas, Los Angeles, Wichita and Atlanta
will be the first of many available worldwide. </p>
<p>  The ""PEEK"" Gateway will allow the
""ABoo Worldwide Network "" to be watched on your cell phone and
forwarded to your Smart TV for viewing on a larger screen. A later software
upgrade will feature a recorder for purchased ""Pay Per View"" events.
Professional sports, concerts and other events will also be available for the
viewers’ enjoyment. The PeekABoo Worldwide Network will compete directly with the existing pay services such as NetFlix and Roku but at drastically lower costs. For those ""cutting the cord"" of cable tv we offer a very attractive alternative. Families are spending an average of $200 a month for cable/satellite tv.  PeekABoo is available on multiple types of mobile and home devices at a cost of $24.95 per year plus any PPV events desired.   </p>
<p>  Beta testing of the basic Gateway with the
""On Demand"" feature is currently under way. The full ""ABoo
Worldwide Network"" is scheduled to be on line by late Spring of  2016. To meet that
goal we need to raise capital for equipment, bandwidth, ""Pay Per
View"" programming and operating expenses.  Your help in funding is requested  on the  Indiegogo.com site. </p><p>Peek Gateway Beta Testers are needed. Beta Testers will have FREE local televison broadcasts,  PPV and On Demand programming during the Beta Test period. Sign up today under ""Perks""on our Indiegogo site!</p>

Gateway. (Your Personal
Entertainment Link) will allow you to watch free TV broadcasts, ""Pay
Per View"" movies or Live Events on your smart phone, Tablet, PC or later
on a Bluetooth enabled Smart TV!
  The ""PEEK"" Gateway is a cell phone
Gateway that enables you to connect to the  Aboo network to view broadcasts of
participating local TV stations , movies, and live events carried by the ""ABoo
Worldwide Network” on most cel phones or your home computer. The
""PEEK"" System delivers a super sharp picture and sound on Apple
products and most Android devices.
  The “PEEK”
Gateway and the ABoo Entertainment Network are being developed by the broadcast
engineers of KCTU TV,  the first
Commercial television station to broadcast 24/7 on the worldwide web. The top
broadcast news publications have acknowleged this with articles published
worldwide.  With a combined total of over
100 years of experience in broadcast, program acquisition, marketing, digital
development and production our engineers have developed the next step in on-
line broadcast, The “PEEK” Aboo Personal entertainment system”!  It’s kinda like the streaming service you currently
use, but on steroids.
  The ""PEEK"" Gateway will be offered
Worldwide on most App Store sites and cell phone retailers for only $24.95 U.S.
Upon purchase the Gateway can be downloaded directly to the licensed device.
Television broadcasts from affiliated stations and networks will be available to
licensed clients Free, while "" Pay Per View"" selections and special
events will cost a reasonable fee payable thru PayPal right on the
""PEEK"" Gateway. 
  All Broadcast stations and networks
available using the ""PEEK"" Gateway will be legally licensed for
retransmission of the programming by the ""ABoo Worldwide Network"".
Stations located in Oklahoma City, Dallas, Los Angeles, Wichita and Atlanta
will be the first of many available worldwide. 
  The ""PEEK"" Gateway will allow the
""ABoo Worldwide Network "" to be watched on your cell phone and
forwarded to your Smart TV for viewing on a larger screen. A later software
upgrade will feature a recorder for purchased ""Pay Per View"" events.
Professional sports, concerts and other events will also be available for the
viewers’ enjoyment. The PeekABoo Worldwide Network will compete directly with the existing pay services such as NetFlix and Roku but at drastically lower costs. For those ""cutting the cord"" of cable tv we offer a very attractive alternative. Families are spending an average of $200 a month for cable/satellite tv.  PeekABoo is available on multiple types of mobile and home devices at a cost of $24.95 per year plus any PPV events desired.   
  Beta testing of the basic Gateway with the
""On Demand"" feature is currently under way. The full ""ABoo
Worldwide Network"" is scheduled to be on line by late Spring of  2016. To meet that
goal we need to raise capital for equipment, bandwidth, ""Pay Per
View"" programming and operating expenses.  Your help in funding is requested  on the  Indiegogo.com site. Peek Gateway Beta Testers are needed. Beta Testers will have FREE local televison broadcasts,  PPV and On Demand programming during the Beta Test period. Sign up today under ""Perks""on our Indiegogo site!

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>Design&amp;Features</b></p>
<p>In our
experience, most pre-production samples still have a slight variation from the
final mass produced unit.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Manufacturing</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We need to finish tooling to
manufacture different parts of the product. 
</p>
<p>This process
is complex and requires time and money. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Complications could potentially emerge and delay the manufacturing schedule.  </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">To tackle this risk we selected one
of the top thermal printer manufacturers ""Sanei Electric Inc."" as a
manufacturing partner.   </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">This company has been supplying
thermal printer product and has come in response to lots of printing demand.This way, the project risks are

<p><b>Q. Do we need 2 POSTIEs to start
sending/receiving messages?</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Only one POSTIE is needed to start the
communication. By setting the recipient's smartphone to “receive message“ mode
and pairing with POSTIE via Bluetooth, the recipient is able to receive
messages instantly from other users who send messages from POSTIE app on their
smartphones. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>However, the interactive
communication and messaging is abled when 2 POSTIEs are in use on both the
recipient ‘s side and sender ‘s side. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q. What OS is required  to run the POSTIE application?</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It’s compatible with iOS and Android.
There might be some restriction on older versions. Please be advised, we will
update the detail information about  recommended versions in the near future.</p>
<p><b>Q. What color options are available for
POSTIE?</b></p>
<p>Currently POSTIE  is only available in egg yolk yellow. We will
release new color options depending on the feedback and demands.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Q. Can we download SDK?</b></p>
<p>We are currently not looking to
release an official SDK. However, we consider the options
depending on the demands. Please be advised that the SDK might only be released
as an unofficial SDK. </p>
<p><b>Q. Is ink required for POSTIE?</b></p>
<p>It uses thermal printing, therefore
you will not need to use any ink. It uses a standard thermal paper for receipt
(58mm size), which could be easily obtained. Please check the size before
purchase.</p>
<p><b>Q. Which countries do we ship our
product?</b></p>


We currently only deliver within
Japan and the U.S. If there is a high demand from other market, we may consider
the options of expanding our services in the future

</div></div>","Simple but meaningful than e-mail.POSTIE is your personal postman connecting special friends and family who live far away with handwritten messages.   






POSTIE was exhibited at SXSW INTERACTIVE 2016 from March 13 to March 16, 2016. We'd like to thank the many people who tried POSTIE. Their feedback is important to us as we move towards production.













POSTIE is more than a gadget; it’s a
friend. He can deliver personalized handwritten messages and pictures to family and friends with a special touch.











Before starting to send/receive
messages,  both the recipient and the
sender need to install the app on their smartphones. Next the recipient need to
place the smartphone onto POSTIE to be able to receive personalized messages
freely. 

















To achieve the best possible user
experience, our team puts a great deal of efforts into designing and developing
both the hardware and the app of POSTIE.






POSTIE is not just our regular
postman; He is your personalized buddy who delivers special messages to family and  friends.
Our POSTIE is cute, a little silly,
and playful. We reflected his
personality in the lovely design.
When POSTIE is in his “free time”, he likes to wiggle, blink or look around, so you won't get bored staring at
him. When POSTIE delivers a message, he looks like a playful child making  funny face by sticking his tongue off.  We
spent a great deal of time and effort to make sure the POSTIE's design oozes cuteness and joy for all ages.



POSTIE is your designated postman to
deliver your messages to family and friends.









During the prototype process, we were determined to improve the quality of thermal printing.
Through extensive research, we reached the conclusion that partnering up with
SANEI ELECTRIC INC. One of the leading thermal printing companies in the world
would enable us to produce the highest quality of thermal printers. 
We believe that by adopting one of
the world’s leading thermal printing technology developed by  SANEI ELECTRIC INC. , it will ensure the
printing quality for POSTIE.




POSTIE is your friend who can send
memos, deliver messages, and help to express feelings that might
otherwise be difficult to express through a simple text message. Unlike a
digital message, POSTIE prints out a physical paper, which will preserve your emotions and thoughts. To make POSTIE a lovable character,
we spent a great deal of  time and effort on the app design and UX.

When in receiving mode, POSTIE app
will display POSTIE’s interface with different “facial
expressions”.  The “facial
expression”  on POSTIE’s interface will change depends on the mode such as when receiving messages.





























Risks & Challenges

Design&Features
In our
experience, most pre-production samples still have a slight variation from the
final mass produced unit.

Manufacturing


We need to finish tooling to
manufacture different parts of the product. 

This process
is complex and requires time and money. Complications could potentially emerge and delay the manufacturing schedule.  To tackle this risk we selected one
of the top thermal printer manufacturers ""Sanei Electric Inc."" as a
manufacturing partner.   This company has been supplying
thermal printer product and has come in response to lots of printing demand.This way, the project risks are
minimized.



Shipping
We've given
a conservative estimate for our delivery dates. We are
committed to keeping you informed of our progress both during and following our
campaign. We will do our best to ship the
product to your door on time. However, if there are any problems with it, we
will let you know immediately and we will do everything to solve the problem.

<span style=""font-weight: normal;""><p>Mobile communications will be cheap, convenient and
available worldwide. In every possible spot a man can set a foot to. Right at
your smartphone.</p>
<p>This company was founded because like you, we have a
dream to stay connected to the ones we love, no matter where we are in the
world. We want global mobile service at about $10 a month, with unlimited data,
no roaming, or other crappy charges and inconveniences. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Maybe you think that will happen one day in the
future. Well, we're happy to announce we have a solution today.</p>

<h2 id=""vopros1"">Q: What will be the latency in service we provide?</h2>
<p>A: Latency inside our system will not be more than 350-400 ms and typically it’s much lower. It is our top priority to keep issues like that under control.We are able to provide that latency because our satellites will be on a low orbit, so any signals will have a short path, and because we’re working on smart routing. </p>
<p>We think 400 ms is a pretty good value for latency of satellite service, and it will allow our customers to use the satellite connections for all applications including voice conversations, internet services and so on without inconvenience. </p>
<h2 id=""vopros2"">Q: What about Uplink?</h2>
<p>A: Uplink
channel has more energy than downlink, and is easier to design. </p>
<p>This occurs because each satellite has plenty of
connections and its transmitter shares energy between many receivers on devices.
And each device’s transmitter works with just one satellite receiver. So the
energy of the combined transmitters of many devices is higher than the energy
of a single satellite transmitter. Since the antennas of both channels are the
same, the uplink has more energy.  </p>
<p>Each
device will have a 2W transmitter and unique antennas with narrow radiation
patterns. This will help to save a particular device’s and a particular
satellite’s energy and maintain good connection.</p>
<h2 id=""vopros3"">Q: What is the bandwidth?</h2>
<p>A: We’ll
provide each device with up to 2Mbps (uplink and downlink combined) of
bandwidth. However, in rush hours the bandwidth could be lower, but still
enough to maintain a good connection for voice conversations and simple
internet activity. </p>
<p>Our priority in the initial stages is to provide our
customers with cheap, convenient and worldwide mobile communications. Once we
have accomplished that then in successive stages we’ll increase the bandwidth
of our links.  </p>
<h2 id=""vopros4"">Q: Why do we need 135 satellites?</h2>
<p>A: There’re
two key reasons:</p>
<p>a)
We’d like to cover the whole planet.</p>
<p>b)
We need to keep latency under control and provide sufficient bandwidth.</p>
<p>Those
issues combined define many factors like: satellite type, altitude of orbit
(Low Earth Orbit), quantity of satellites and so on. We have spent plenty of
time doing research, and we think 135 is the right number to provide great
global services at affordable price.</p>
<h2 id=""vopros5"">Q: Why do we think we can make mobile communications cheap, convenient and
worldwide, while large tech corporations can’t?</h2>
<p>A: Large
corporations usually are not very quick, innovative or smart. They do have
money, but money is not the only ingredient, and definitely not the most
important one. Moreover there’re many management levels, special decision
making processes and so on. Good ideas much rather get a “no” from management,
because new ideas imply new risks. And who likes risks? And who is willing to
take it? Entrepreneurs are, not managers. 
</p>
<p>Skype,
Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon - those companies weren’t large corporations
when they decided to change the world. But ultimately they did. That’s how it
works. </p>
<h2 id=""vopros6"">Q: What about prices?</h2>
<p>A: Yaliny
Point, our device, will cost about $150.</p>
<p>Communications
within our network, internet and all incoming calls will be free, with a $10 monthly subscription fee.</p>
<p>Outgoing
calls to outside of our network will be cheaper than usual VoIP rates (like
Skype).</p>
<h2 id=""vopros7"">Q: What size/weight will Yaliny Point have? How long will its battery last?</h2>
<p>A: Yaliny Point will weigh not
more than a regular smartphones, and will have about the same size. And our
devices will be able to maintain at least 10 hours of talk time, or internet
use, and will last up to 240 hours in standby mode.</p>
<h2 id=""vopros8"">Q: Which smartphones will Yaliny Point support? </h2>
<p>A: It
will support smartphones with Android 2.3.x+ and iOS 7.1+ from the beginning.We’ll continue updating it and making it compatible with other
smartphones as soon as possible.  </p>
<h2 id=""vopros9"">Q: Can I use Yaliny Point as a backup battery for my smartphone?</h2>

our devices will have this feature.</p><p><br/></p>

available worldwide. In every possible spot a man can set a foot to. Right at
your smartphone.
This company was founded because like you, we have a
dream to stay connected to the ones we love, no matter where we are in the
world. We want global mobile service at about $10 a month, with unlimited data,
no roaming, or other crappy charges and inconveniences. 

Maybe you think that will happen one day in the
future. Well, we're happy to announce we have a solution today.

Our Satellite

Info about our constellation
The satellite constellation will consist of 135 LEO satellites on circular orbit, at 370 miles [600 km] altitude. They will cover the entire planet’s surface. One of the most important points about our satellites is they should be fairly light and small enough to be stacked in one large rocket such as Falcon Heavy. We’re designing them exactly that way - to do just one launch. This will cut initial funding required to create an infrastructure, so we’ll be able to provide cheaper services.Jump to: How it works | App | Roadmap | Perks | Team | FAQs

internet connection and VoIP-like services – the ability to place
and receive calls, texts and so on. We’re designing it to be fast
and reliable, with excellent encryption, convenient synchronization,
and the ability to connect to standard internet links like 3G and
others. This application will also have several additional important
features that you can’t imagine a mobile app without.Some
interesting facts 
Canadians using their cellphones abroad pay some of the most expensive wireless data roaming charges out there, according to a study from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
The U.S. ranks among the highest in the world in the cost of phone data plans. According to research by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) the average phone plan with 500MB of data costs $85 in the U.S., compared to $24.10 in China and $8.80 in the U.K.

Yahaya Wahab from Malaysia received the highest cell phone bill of all time. It was $218 Trillion.

Why we need your supportThe real key to ending all those bad experiences we face with mobile phone services is effective infrastructure. Realistically, there is only one way to make communications actually available worldwide - and that’s through the use of satellites in space. Here at Yaliny, we use cutting edge technologies and have been working hard for more than a year, to design small, light, inexpensive and high performance satellites from cratch. Simultaneously, we’ve also been working on the other components that make up the telecommunication infrastructure.We've successfully completed that research stage, and are going to the next level - actually building a satellite, Yaliny Point and other hardware. However, making this a reality is a process which demands a lot of extensive scientific innovation, time and money.We invite you to partner with us to create our future together.Why we need $250 000All funds we'll raise through Indiegogo will be spent on a hardware. In order to build a full scale satellite prototype on this stage, we need very expensive equipment for Super High Frequency electronics, different satellite parts and so on. Please support us to make this happen.Meet the Yaliny Team

step is an easy, non-slip way to shave, tan, exfoliate or moisturise your legs
in the shower.


We have all been frustrated with the awkward balancing act trying to shave our legs in the shower. The alternative
was to lean on the bathtub but this is often messy, slippery and what happens
when you don’t have a bathtub at all?
THE ANSWER IS ELEVARE.


SIMPLE TO USE.

Simply place the ergonomically designed step in the corner
of your shower and the non-slip rubber grips will keep your leg balanced and
secure.

With your leg at a convenient, ergonomic height you can shave, tan, exfoliate, apply hair removal treatments or moisturise comfortably and safely. 




When you are finished simply rinse the Elevare down in the
shower. The elegant, one piece design is easy to clean and has an integrated
hanger detail that can also store your razor neatly.

<p>Thanks for taking a look at our project!</p>
<p>We are creating a solution to a problem that almost every traveler has faced - the frustration of losing something while on a trip. </p>
<p>First comes the hassle of retracing your steps, trying to contact every Lost and Found along the way (if you can figure out how). Hoping against all odds that your stuff is found and someone contacts you, knowing that the chances are slim. And how long do you wait before you give up and tell your carrier about the lost phone, or (gulp) tell your boss about your lost laptop?</p>
<p>What about the frustration of trying to reload your apps, your contact list, your preferences, your projects and data? Or having to get new keys cut for the ones you had on that lost ring?</p>
<p>Pijunn is a project that we are confident will help people avoid these frustrations, by making it easy to get back the stuff that you lose. </p>
<p>We start by creating tamper proof labels, key fobs, and other identifiers that you put on your valuables. They look something like this:</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/203/688/a8677bb970654d8b4e0ccc53f0d8b45e_large.jpeg?1349996583"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><em>We sell these AT COST to travelers, in various packages. We don't want to make a cent on the labels - we want everyone to use them!</em></p>
<p>When you lose something, you go to the website or hotline and report it. We log it, and then send out an APB to every Lost and Found department where you think you may have left it. Oh, and it doesn't have to have one of our labels - we will take down a description of the item and try and find it that way.</p>
<p>When someone <em>finds</em> your stuff, they simply call the hotline or go to the website and report it. We work to match the finder with the lost item. And then the magic happens.</p>
<p>We broker a connection between the owner and the finder. The owner proves that the item is theirs, and specifies how they want to get it back. We take care of the processing and shipping (for a fee). Presto the lost item is returned to the owner, the finder is issued a reward, and the world is a better place!</p>
<p>We need your help to get this off the ground. We need to finish building the software to support all of this, which we are doing ourselves but there is overhead (and we like to eat). We also need to order the first batch of labels.</p>
<p>In exchange for your help, you will be the first ones to take advantage of the labels and the service that we provide behind them! We hope that you never have to count on them, but you will sleep better knowing that the valuables that you travel with are protected.</p>
<p>Thanks, and happy travels.</p>

A Shopping Eco-Friendly Platform
Despite
the challenge in developing this unique software for consumers worldwide, it’s as simple as saying YES to the retailer adding your email to
their request and the rest is easy—stores the receipt, the photo of the item
purchased, and instantly you can  send images to family & friends on
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, 
Pinterest, etc.—anywhere your imagination desires.  You have a receipt for a return if the need
arises, a quality photo of the item and  purchase date; a receipt for taxes and
charitable contributions; and fun of sharing your great purchase with anyone in
your social network.

Thus our team developed the world's tiny multi-country charger: Qcharger, an 8-in-1 adapter for work, travel, home, and power 4 devices simultaneously.  Pick the Qcharger for 5 reasons:Among those international plug chargers, Qcharger brings you:✔️ The dimension is super tiny in the same power output of other international plugs✔️ It provides the most ports (2 USB-C +1 USB-A + AC Outlet) in other same dimension and power charger✔️ The 65W PD output supports PD3.0, PPS, QC4.0+, QC3.0, QC2.0, AFC, SCP, FCP, Apple2.4A, PE+, BC1.2, and more✔️ Very handy works in over 200 countries with just two slide pins✔️ The delicateness and hand-feeling are the most pleasing ones

https://twitter.com/nintendolife/status/1367800636549586947 Smaller than similar chargersUsing the latest gallium nitride technology, Qcharger has realized a precise and small design concept. The pocket-size is only 37 x 56 x 65mm and the weight is 160g, more portable for you.  Why can GaN shrink the size?A key benefit of GaN and other WBG materials is their relationship between breakdown voltage and Ron, which improves conduction losses.GaN reduces switching losses through the absence of a body diode. The switching losses are lower in GaN, the time between switches can be reduced, increasing the switching frequency. The increased switching frequency allows the size of many large components (such as the transformer, inductors, and output capacitors) to be reduced.  GaN and other WBG devices also have better thermal conductivity and can withstand higher temperatures than silicon. Both help to reduce the need for thermal management components such as bulky heatsinks, frames, or fans. The absence of these devices (along with the shrinking of the powertrain components mentioned earlier) all lead to significant reductions in the overall size of the power supply. 8-in-1Don't underestimate its small size, Qcharger is equipped with 3 USB charging ports and one universal AC outlet. In other words, Qcharger integrates the US, UK, EU & AU plug into one sleek unit. 4 kinds of pins can be used at will by only two push bars, compatible with more than 200 countries or regions.    At the same time, Qcharger can plug into type A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, N, and O outlets. You can work with 4 devices simultaneously.So perfect & delicate design! Wherever you go, you only need to carry one Qcharger instead of more different chargers for multiple devices, which saves more space for you to store other things and your package would look cleaner. So many plugs depend on which one do you need to use or where you are from. Stackable GaN ChargerTiny yet powerful 65W GaN chargers with pass-thru AC outlet that can stack to become a 2500W charger, all from a single wall outlet. Qcharger stacks upon itself and lets you power multiple laptops from a single power outlet. Qcharger 65W Stackable GaN Chargers provide that even after stacking 3 chargers over a single power outlet, it is able to pass through more than 2500W of power to power a water kettle and each Qcharger is still able to provide the maximum power of 65W respectively.  65W USB OutputThe Qcharger 65W PD output is super powerful among other multi-country chargers. It supports 65W output to fully charge 3 devices at the same time, which is enough to charge a laptop, smartphone & mobile devices simultaneously. With a Qcharger and a USB-C to USB-C cable, you can charge a Samsung laptop up to 50% in about 30 minutes. When powers multiple devices, USB-C1 delivers 45W Max, and the rest of the ports share 18W in total.  Intelligent Power Distribution

The PCBA of the GaN circuit board has multiple protection functions, such as short-circuit protection, multi-current protection. Safety measures against electric shockSome adapters with wide-open slots can easily attract curious toddlers putting their fingers in. It’s too dangerous.

You have really delivered – not only did you deliver when you said you would, but I am thrilled with the product.""  - Monnett Soldo""I just received my Koala Storage bank and I must say it was VERY, VERY well presented when I opened the package. It is everything I thought it would be from watching the video presentation. The lights on the side for determining how much charge the bank has, is a very very convenient feature. I plan on using it on camping trips, as I have a lot of electronic gear that is rechargeable via usb. Flashlights, lighters, mp3 players, and speakers are all USB rechargable.

The results from these tests were very promising. This is what some of our users said: Unpluq is the device to help you win the battle for your attention. It gives you time to focus on the things you find meaningful in life. With the addition of a physical key, you have to make a conscious decision to physically plug the key in and access distracting apps. Furthermore, we give you the option to create the barrier to distraction yourself: you can decide where to store the Unpluq key when you want to focus.  Unpluq is the combination of a hardware key (the Unpluq key) and a custom Android launcher (the Unpluq Launcher). A launcher is the software on your phone that allows you to open other apps - it’s what you see when you press the home button. By detaching the Unpluq key from your phone, the launcher switches to Unpluq mode, in which only apps of your choice will be available and notifications of all other apps will be blocked. Yet when you make the conscious decision to plug the Unpluq key back in, you will have the functionality of your entire phone, and the notifications that were blocked while you were in Unpluq mode will be shown to you.Have a look at how Unpluq works in more detail in this video of our working prototype:    Unpluq is the combination of buying a minimalist/dumb phone, combined with all the useful functionality your smartphone has to offer. No need to buy a minimalist phone, just transform your phone into one!You decide when you use all functionality of your phone, or when you transform it into a useful, distraction-free device.  When you order an Unpluq key you will receive it together with the Unpluq launcher, a quick set-up guide and an Ebook that will give you tips on what to do with all the time that you receive by spending less time on your smartphone.   We went through several iterations to get to the current hardware design. We chose this bright yellow colour to make the Unpluq key extra visible when you are plugged in. This reminds you that you are using distracting apps. We chose to make a combination of hardware and software because we found that for most people, the current software solutions don’t offer enough to help you regain control over your smartphone.The Unpluq key is designed for you to be easily attached to your keychain, so you won’t lose it. Unpluq launcher in Unpluq mode Unpluq launcher in normal mode We developed a custom Android launcher. A launcher is the software on your phone that allows you to open other apps - it’s what you see when you press the home button.We wanted to keep it simple, without too much distraction.  That's why the launcher is in greyscale when you're in Unpluq mode. The launcher has a simple homescreen where you will see six of your favourite apps. Swipe up to see all your apps and swipe down to see the notifications that were filtered for you while you were unplugged. To the right of the favorite apps, you will have a screen where you can place your favorite widgets.

Ohsnap is a non-invasive, premium phone grip that makes it simple and easy to use your phone, no matter the circumstance. It adheres directly to your phone or phone case and provides tremendous functionality without sacrificing fashion or bulk. Ohsnap provides incredible utility while remaining so sleek and thin that you won't even notice it's there until you need it.
 
Featured on:

Meet Ohsnap.

Grip
Pressing the center circle of the Ohsnap releases the finger band. Use the ""U"" shape as a grip or connect the ends together to make a complete loop. With a finger through the loop, phone drops are next to impossible.
 Super Strength

Kickstand
Ohsnap can be used as a snap-up kickstand. Watch videos hands-free at the best viewing angle. Magnetic
Utilize magnetic surfaces like refrigerators, workout machinery, and magnetic car grips to place your phone somewhere convenient while you multi-task. Sticky Plates!
Every ohsnap comes with 1 FREE sticky plate. These can be used to affix ohsnap literally anywhere. Additionally, you'll be able to purchase additional sticky plates during the survey at the end of the campaign!


 
Rotation

Whether you're capturing content or playing it back, switching between portrait and landscape mode is easy thanks to the Ohsnap's 360 degrees of constant friction rotation. Slide
Ohsnap allows you to reach every inch on your phone by sliding up and down. Slim Design
Get a more secure grip on your phone while you're using it, and easily slide it in your pocket or pocket book when you're not. Ohsnap is less than 3mm thick. Car Mount Compatible
Sticks to EXISTING magnetic car mounts. Say goodbye to complex enormous car mounts and phones sliding in the dreaded seat crack. Wireless Charging Compatible
Easily slide out the frame for convenient wireless charging! Comfortable
The snap band is coated in silky smooth silicone and feels great to behold. Marathon insta sessions never felt so good. Premium Materials
Aircraft-grade aluminum, steel, and satiny silicone, resulting in a premium feel and ultimate reliability. Ohsnap is now the world's first and only phone grip that literally checks all the boxes that other products to date have not been able to. You deserve a no-compromise phone experience.

 
You can unstick and re-apply Ohsnap multiple times! If the adhesive gets dirty, wash it with water. Once dry, the adhesive should be as strong as ever.

Did you realize USB cables are so easily-frayed that they almost lose their economic and environmental advantage just like disposable batteries?  We can replace the disposable battery with the rechargeable one. What can we replace the easy frayed cable with?Have you been looking for a durable USB cable that magically regenerates itself after frayed or broken? You are in luck，take a look to our high-tech regenerative USB cable, ""RenewCable"" by SirTeen. Say NO to short-lived USB cables.
 Great Feedbacks from Media and testers How It WorksRenew Cable brings the revolutionary solution that allows the cable to regenerate after it is broken, frayed, or shredded. The cable is so durable that you will no longer need to replace it with another one!  Self Renew InstructionsElegant DesignUnlike other self-proclaimed unbreakable USB cables, we attach the importance of aesthetic to its design. You will like its softness and colorful cord and start to ask why you need stiff and hard cable in the first place.
All Types Suit to Your Devices Security ChipBuilt-in security chip can detect the status of the cable and socket/port. The cable automatically turns off the current when not charging. Not only does this function protracts the battery life of your phone and gadgets, more importantly, it also protects you from electrical hazards.  BenefitsOur RenewCable is designed for a lifespan of 20 years. Cables on average have the life expectancy of 3 to 6 months. If a cable is frayed every half year, one will instead consume 30 to 40 cables during the lifespan of RenewCable. The alternative 40 cables can cost you up to 400 bucks. By choosing our product, you can save over 90% on cable spending.  We have reviewed some depressing statistics done by researchers: An estimated 50 million tons of E-waste are produced each year. The USA discards 30 million computers each year and 100 million phones are disposed of in Europe each year. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that only 15–20% of e-waste is recycled, the rest of these electronics go directly into landfills and incinerators.Guiyu in the Shantou region of China is a massive electronic waste processing community. It is often referred to as the ""e-waste capital of the world.""  Guiyu is only one example of digital dumps but similar places can be found across the world in Nigeria, Ghana, and India’.We need something more sustainable and eco-friendly. By switching from regular USB Cable to Renew Cable, you are making a contribution to our environment. One RenewCable can replace more than 30 regular USB cables. The cord of our cable is covered with TPE, a material that meets the requirements of human skin contact hygiene and is widely recognized as a green environmental protection material. 
What’s Inside The Cable
Comparison Chart Why It MattersUSB cable usually frays at the junction between the port and the cord. Once they are frayed, they're potentially dangerous and need to be replaced with a new one.  A phone cable puts out 5 volts at 5 watts/1 amp (a tablet charger puts out 12 watts/2.1 amps), and while that doesn't sound like much, it's more than enough power to cause overheating and the beginnings of a fire. On top of that, a frayed cable can also cook the battery by causing a short circuit, which again can result in a fire.Where The Idea Comes FromOur industrial designers observed the distinct regenerative nature of lizard. Facing a strong enemy, the lizard will cute its tail off so it may escape the dire situation and regenerate its tail. This was the inspiration that facilitates the design of our regenerative cable. Who We AreSirTeen is committed to innovated smart electronic products with our passionate research, production, and sales team.  Focusing on making smart devices for daily use, We insist on the originality, functionality, safety, beauty, and environmental friendliness of our products. By choosing materials with high standards of environmental protection, we are able to minimize the damage to the planet from electronic items.

</div><div><br/></div></div>","A perfect solution for the almost 70% of users who experience poor signal coverage, mJoose delivers stronger connectivity, better call quality and fewer dropped calls. 

Works on iPhone 6/6S, 6 Plus/6S Plus, Galaxy s6 and Galaxy s6 Edge. 





                                           







CES awarded the
mJoose 3-in-1 Case TWO Innovation Awards in the Portable Power and Wireless
Accessories Categories. Long hours by our talented engineering team led the
way to this acknowledged breakthrough technology.

















                         






1) Cell Signal Amplifier
Unlike existing battery cases, the mJoose 3-in-1 Case includes cell signal amplification with patented micro-electronics that are so small they fit into the protective case. The multi-band (700-2100MHz) cell signal amplifier will improve your iPhone or Galaxy signal strength wherever you go.


2) Battery Extender

mJoose comes has an integrated 3000 mAh battery that will fully charge your battery for up to 14 hours of additional talking time. The mJoose case also charges twice as fast as traditional charging! 


3) Protective Case
Slim-line 3.5 ounce attractive protective case.






  




                                                  
Become one of the first to pre-order by taking advantage of our Early Bird specials. 












Up to 100x
signal strength: While signal strength and voice quality may
vary depending on the carrier and user location, the mJoose case lab results
from a CTIA-certified lab verified 20dB gain which is up to 100x signal strength. 


mJoose CEO Daniel Ash demonstrates the case giving 20dB gain 



Upgraded Internet Connectivity: When signal
strength is low, the smartphone user may be connected to the Internet at a
tower with lower 2G or 3G equipment. mJoose can extend the reach to connect
with other 4G or LTE if within the new extended range which results in better Internet
connectivity at 4G or LTE speeds.
120% extended
battery life: The built-in 3000 mAh rechargeable battery
delivers an additional 17 hours talk time, up to 14 hours video playback and an
additional 60 hours audio playback.



                               
Additional battery life savings: Poor reception significantly drains battery life as
the phone aggressively tries to connect to the tower. Our amplifier secures a
better connection to the carrier network which reduces the power drain up to
25% for both the extended battery and the iPhone battery. 
Complete mobility:
The 3-in-1 Amp Case travels with the consumer to concerts, hotel rooms,
conferences, sports field, etc. 
Consumers now have ubiquitous, improved signal coverage in areas plagued
by weak signals.





Whether on vacation or business trips, the world’s first cell
signal amplifier that gives you up to 100x signal so you get better reception
and fewer dropped calls everywhere you go!


No more running out of battery at inopportune times. 100%
extended battery life: mJoose gives you 2x the battery life + charges 75%
faster than traditional charging! 


Finally, you can cruise through the dreaded “weak signal” zones
with confidence that your calls will not drop and your battery will not die.


                                         






                           
For the past year we have completed R&D, built prototypes and working samples. We have selected our manufacturing partner, started tooling, and have procured components. In December we will finalize the iPhone 6/6S manufacturing for January shipping, 6 Plus/6S Plus in February, and Galaxy s6 in March.

<p><b>What is the battery size?</b> The battery is 3000 mAh. For perspective, an iPhone 6 is 1810 mAh and Samsung Galaxy S5 is 2800 mAh, so most smartphones will receive one or more full charges.</p>
<p><b>Does the Chargestand work with a case?</b> Yes, the stand is designed to accommodate all cases, even an Otterbox.</p>
<p><b>Does it come in any other colors?</b> Currently, the Chargestand is only offered in one color - light gray exterior with soft touch paint, a polished graphite black interior and a 50/50 orange/black braided cable. We are open to offering other colors later in the campaign if we raise enough for the production to make sense.<br/></p>
<p><b>Does the Chargestand work with tablets?</b> Chargestand does not have the max charge rate that tablets require, but it will still charge and work great as a stand for 7-8"" tablets.<br/></p>
<p><b>When the stand is plugged in, does the phone charge before or after the stand?</b> The phone charges first, and once it is fully charged the stand battery will begin to charge.<br/></p>
<p><b>Will the Chargestand be Apple approved?</b> Yes, the stand will be MFi certified for Apple devices, and also has CE, CEC and Rohs certifications.<br/></p>
<p><b>If I purchase a perk that contains 2 or more Chargestands, can they be a mix of Android and Apple tips?</b> Yes! We will be following up after the campaign ends to find out which tips you'd like. You will be able to select all Apple, all Android or a mix of both.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Does it have a speaker?</b> The Chargestand does not have a built-in speaker, but has very little effect on the speaker sound. The speakers and headphone port will also be completely accessible in landscape mode.</p>
<p><b>How does it sync my phone?</b> The Chargestand comes with a 4-foot micro-USB sync cable, which plugs into the back of the stand and the computer's USB port.<br/></p>
<p><b>How long does the stand take to charge?</b> The Chargestand takes 3-4 hours to charge from 0% to 100%.<br/></p>
<p><b>How can I check the battery level?</b> The Chargestand has 4 indicator lights on the front. Tap the power button on the back to see battery level (4 lights: 100%; 3 lights: 75%; and so on).<br/></p>
<p><b>Will I always have to turn it on to use it?</b> If your Chargestand is plugged in on your desk, you can just put your phone on it and it will work. If your stand is not connected to power, you simply press and hold the power button on the back to turn on the battery.<br/></p>

</div></div>","This is Chargestand, the versatile stand designed to dock and charge your smart phone at home, at work, or on the go.







Phone docks are great for lots of reasons: They help de-clutter your desktop, make it quick and easy to charge and sync your phone, and allow you to see and use your phone hands-free. So what if you could do more with a stand? 


What if you had something truly portable? 









Something that could power your device in the office, kitchen or bedroom, on a plane or a bus, in a pocket or a bag?


What if you could use it in portrait or landscape orientation, sitting at your desk or reclining on your couch?






Chargestand does all these things. Not only can it conveniently charge and sync your device, it also has a built in 3000 mAh battery, enough to provide an iPhone 6 more than one full recharge.  We’ve designed a ChargeStand with lightening, micro-USB and USB-C tips that will work with both Apple and Android devices. It even works with cases.

We believe in the Chargestand’s ability to keep you connected throughout your day. There’s no extra batteries to forget; the Chargestand charges your phone, and then charges itself. The Chargestand is small, powerful, and great on the go.










Charge your device on the go by pulling the cable out of the Chargestand. Put it in your pocket, bag, or car - anywhere you may need power on the go.



The Chargestand is smaller than your wallet, so take it with you in even the smallest purse.






Use the Chargestand in your car, on a bus, on the subway or in an airplane for an extra boost getting from A to B. The battery is 3000 mAh, enough to provide an iPhone 6 more than one full recharge. The battery only takes 3-4 hours to charge from 0% to 100%.




Traditional phone docks are bulky, stationary, don’t work with cases, aren't portable and only function in portrait orientation.
















Other types of phone chargers don't give you any of the additional useful features that a dock provides.














Dimensions: 2.35"" x 3.30"" x 1.25"" closed, 3.0"" tall when open
Colors: Soft touch light gray outer, glossy graphite black inner, orange and black braided cable
Materials: Main housing: PC + ABS blend, outside has premium soft touch finish. Anti-skid phone rest: TPU
Tips: Lightning, micro-USB and planning to include USB-C.
Electronic Specs:
3000 mAh battery
Braided tangle-resistant cable
Charge and sync device
Chargestand battery charge time: 3-4 hours
Input: 1 A
Output: 5 V DC (Lightning: 1 A / Micro: 1.5 A)
Short circuit, over current, over charge, over discharge and over temperature protection
Operating temperature: 14F–113F
MFi certified for Apple devices  
CE, CEC and Rohs certified








We have a final functional and aesthetic prototype, which represents the colors and materials that you will receive.
All perks will be light gray outer with a soft touch finish, graphite black inner with a polished finish, and 50/50 orange and black cable.



You will be contacted after the end of the campaign to choose between Apple and Android versions.







































Estimated Shipping Date: July 2016

Larger orders will require significant capital that your pledge will

<p></p></div>","Do you Love your Tablet, but Hate to hold it? Have you ever supported your tablet with your legs, or propped your tablet up on a stack of pillows?  Are you ready for a solution?  Introducing Tab-Legs. Flexible Stands for your Tablet, designed for your favorite computing locations, and crafted for comfort.  Hi, My name is Dr. Charles Barr, and I LOVE my Tablet computer.  I use it to check emails, to read, watch movies, and shop.  I almost always use my tablet when watching TV, and enjoy the mobility of my Tablet while in bed, and when I travel. Here’s the problem. I don't like to hold my Tablet. I love everything about it, except the fact that I need to constantly support it.  It's not heavy, but always having to hold it causes pain in my neck, back, hands, and wrists. I tried to prop it up with some pillows, and even rested it on a nearby table; but nothing worked. My posture actually got worse, and with my new awkward positions, came new types of pain.  There had to be a solution. So I stopped holding my Tablet, and designed a tablet computer stand specifically for the places I use my tablet the most; my sofa, recliner, bed, and on an airplane.  I wanted to create a  stand that could improve my posture and let me
sit comfortably in these locations, while freeing up  my hands. Fast forward
a year and a half, and I am proud to introduce       - Tab-Legs -  Flexible stands for
tablets and phones!   Here's How they Work...We launched Tab-Legs in the summer of 2014 on our own
website, and Amazon.com and celebrated a warm welcome to market.  Our sales steadily increased until we were
completely out of product. Yes, we sold out within a few months.  We literally could not make Tab-Legs fast
enough, and were forced to scale the manufacturing to meet demand.  That is where we are today; scrambling to meet
demand; seeking your support.Why You are So Important:
We need your support to expand our manufacturing by securing additional
space at the local factory, and hiring additional employees to manufacture and
assemble.  We will also use this funding
to place larger orders for our materials, thus lowering costs on future orders if done right. 
Larger orders will require significant capital that your pledge will
help fund.  If we don’t reach our funding
goal, the raised capital will go directly into hiring another position to maximize
production lead times. Either way, you get your Tab-Legs
Currently our last boutique batch of Tab-Legs is being
produced by our manufacturer in West Palm Beach, Florida.  Tab-Legs are made here in America, and we
have helped create jobs in our local economy: Palm Beach, and Broward County
Florida. Your pledge will help secure these jobs, and create more. You can Support our campaign in a few different ways:

<p>People need navigation when they are out on a bicycling trip, but there aren't many bike friendly options out there. Have you ever tried holding your phone in your hand and navigating while you're riding ? That can be dangerous, and it drains the battery too quickly .</p>
<p><b>Our idea was simple: design a biking stem that makes your ride uncomplicated and fun no matter where you go: urban exploration , commuting to work, or a long distance road trip.</b></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We conceptualized a design that integrates important biking accessories with your smartphone into one unit. The specially designed slider, battery and front led system all be put together to the bike stem. <b>This is ESTEM - the world’s simplest all-in-one smart biking stem</b>, which includes a front light, phone navigation holder, and a portable charger.</span><br/></p>

<p><span><b>Q1. In addition to bicycles, are there any other vehicles supported by MODVITE ESTEM, such as electric bicycles, motorcycles, etc.?</b></span></p>
<p><b>A: ESTEM can be perfectly adapted to most E-bikes and bicycles with its horizontal pipe diameter of 31.8mm (1.25 inches), and fork tube diameter of 28.6mm (1.13 inches).  Mountain bikes, cross-country (XC), street bikes, and fixed-gear bicycles are included. </b></p>
<b><br/></b><p><b>Q2. What kind of smartphone cases are compatible with ESTEM's phone navigation holder?</b></p>
<p><b>A: ESTEM is compatible with most phone cases without a portable charger. </b></p>
<b><br/></b><p><b>Q3. Can ESTEM handle biking in rain or snow?</b></p>
<p><b>A: While ESTEM has a water proof rating of IP66,  for your smartphone we suggest getting an extra water resistant case. For the sake of personal safety, we do not suggest biking in heavy rain or any other extreme weather.</b></p>
<b><br/></b><p><b>Q4. How can I setup ESTEM specifically on my bike?</b></p>
<p><b>A: The steps are pretty universal and easy to set up on standard stems, which come with 6 M4 crews and 1 M5 crew.  Check the video tutorial by Performance Bicycle here:  <a href=""http://learn.performancebike.com/bikes/advice/how-to-guides/bike-parts-and-components/how-to-change-your-threadless-bike-stem"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://learn.performancebike.com/bikes/advice/how-to-guides/bike-parts-and-components/how-to-change-your-threadless-bike-stem</a></b></p>
<b><br/></b><p><b>Q5. How do I control ESTEM's front light?</b></p>
<p><b>A: Push the round white button on the left front side of the light. The first tap = high beam, second tap = low beam, third tap = fast flash, and fourth tap = slow flash. </b></p>
<b><br/></b><p><b>Q6. Do I have to use the app M Ride together with ESTEM?</b></p>
<p><b>A: This is not necessary. The first generation of ESTEM can be used independently.  We still recommend you use M Ride, which will greatly enhance the riding experience.  It helps track your biking history and stores all of your data:  pace, distance, route, and personal records.  Furthermore, you can even find friends, create challenges, stay on top of the leader board, and share activity within your network.</b></p>
<b><br/></b><p><b>Q7. In what environmental temperature range does ESTEM work?</b></p>
<p><b>A. The temperature range is between -10 °C ~ 60 °C (14°F ~ 140°F)</b></p>

People need navigation when they are out on a bicycling trip, but there aren't many bike friendly options out there. Have you ever tried holding your phone in your hand and navigating while you're riding ? That can be dangerous, and it drains the battery too quickly .
Our idea was simple: design a biking stem that makes your ride uncomplicated and fun no matter where you go: urban exploration , commuting to work, or a long distance road trip.
We conceptualized a design that integrates important biking accessories with your smartphone into one unit. The specially designed slider, battery and front led system all be put together to the bike stem. This is ESTEM - the world’s simplest all-in-one smart biking stem, which includes a front light, phone navigation holder, and a portable charger.












4 STEPS TO START YOUR JOURNEY

Step 1: Plug in your smartphone


Step 2: It will begin charging automatically


Step 3: Open the app


Step 4: Start to navigate the selected best route







ESTEM = 
Connected Flash Light 
+ Phone Navigation Holder 
+ Built-in Portable Charger 
+ Fitness Hub 


Connected flash light: bright and durable






Phone navigation holder: Turns your phone into 
a bicycle navigation system





Rechargeable power station: Keeps your phone going for longer periods


   
Besides, it is optional to use MiBike app as the fitness hub in the same time.
Fitness hub: Keeps track of your biking activities







Go. Explore.
An easy, straight-forward experience


Mount ESTEM on your bike handlebars and go. 












Mount ESTEM on your handlebars, slide your phone into the charging port, click , pop only three steps can complete the charging operation on the phone, and start your trip right away!



Forget the extra accessories, ESTEM is made with module design and comes with the powerful front light, portable charger, and phone/navigation mount to meet all of your mobile demands. The phone mount is designed to safely hold your device secure even in rough terrain. The design is so simple that you can setup it by yourself just like playing LEGO!



Supports most bicycles, such as mountain bikes, cross-country (XC), as well as street bikes. The phone holder is compatible with most of the smart phones in the market. This includes iPhone and Android phones.






ESTEM comes with a rechargeable 5400mAh lithium battery, which enables your phone navigation to function for more than 42 hours of heavy use.



The battery in the back is rechargeable, you can just remove it out and take it home to charge just like the normal power banks.




ESTEM is protected from dust penetration and water immersion (15cm up to 1 meter of depth at 30 minutes) at an International Protection rating of IP66. Go ahead and ride with full confidence in rain, mud, or even snow!



Safety is paramount in biking. The 200 lumens LED front light brings you high-intensity illumination so that you can ride confidently in dark, low visibility environments. Whether you are way out in the mountains, or on poorly lit city streets, ESTEM’s light will cut through the darkness. Weak lighting is a thing of the past!









Super lightweight and highly durable structure

To enhance the users' overall riding experience, we use lightweight aluminum-magnesium alloy material (Aeronautical Material) and made ESTEM's forging integrally molded.
The lightweight material is extremely strong and resists corrosion. Our specially designed slider will hold the phone firmly without hurting it. The rubber case protects the charging port from any damage.

In order to ensure a more secure and efficient lighting experience, we designed the unit to have highly stable internal structural components, and we created a convenient method of removing the battery as well.

A smart, connected, and ultra-portable glucose meter.



 
   




 
 
No more bulky meters, cables, testing supplies, and logbooks to remember to carry all the time.
 


 
 
                  


 




 


The GluCase platform allows a user to see all the contextual information overlaid with their glucose levels so they can better understand how their lifestyle affects their health.
 

 



Operate the GluCase, App, and Platform with ease.




The mobile application, web profile, and dashboard are all built with modern interfaces that are intuitive and easy to learn.
 



The size and weight are comparable to that of a standard smartphone case. No one will know the difference.
 


All of your equipment and supplies are protected and discreet, while never too far away, allowing you to truly live life untethered. 
 

 



Simple, easy-to-use privacy control to guard one's information while sharing with family, nutritionists, and physicians.
 


Data communication between the sensor, mobile application, and cloud platform is HIPAA-compliant & encrypted. GluCase uses Bluetooth low energy (BLE) technology to rapidly and securely transmit your data to your phone without the requirement of extra cables or connector devices. 

 

 
 

GluCase has been thoroughly reviewed by the team at Dragon Innovation to ensure a sound design and manufacturing plan. 

 
​
 
Dragon Innovation works with entrepreneurs to launch hardware products from prototype through production. Their client roster includes Coin, MakerBot, LIFX, Scout, Romotive, Sifteo, Orbotix, FormLabs and many more.  
 

 

 


 
Development of the GluCase began in a dorm room at Cornell University in response to our self-imposed challenge to drastically improve the lives of people living with diabetes. After speaking with countless individuals living with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, we knew that one way to accomplish our goal would be to simplify the form factor of a traditional, bulky, and burdensome glucose meter kit by integrating it with everyone's most prized possession—our smartphone.
 


One year later, we completed the highly competitive Techstars Accelerator program (fewer than 1% of companies admitted) and had developed our first prototypes where we embedded a lancet system and test strip reader into a 3D-printed prototype model. Since then, we've worked tirelessly to get the form factor as small and polished as possible while developing the most intuitive and user-friendly app on the market. 

In the above gif, you can see the working components of an early prototype. All of the components of a traditional glucose measuring system seamlessly integrated into a discreet and compact smartphone case for iOS & Android.


Fast-forward to today in the heart of Silicon Valley. The GluCase app has been streamlined, our form factor is nearing its final state, and our amazing team is being advised by the Former Chairman of the American Diabetes Association, Larry Ellingson. Furthermore, we have ready-to-go manufacturing schedules based on thorough design for manufacture and assembly analyses in which we inspected and analyzed the GluCase design to ensure that it can be manufactured reliably and at top quality.


 


GluCase™ will donate a percent of all proceeds raised by the campaign to the Chris Dudley Foundation Basketball Camp for Kids with Diabetes.

<div>How would you like to be part of a revolutionary shift in consumer electronic technology, one where technology learns and adapts to meet your individual needs instead of you learning how to use its features? After years of research and development, we have a product in the final stages of development that can fundamentally change the way we live and play.</div>
<div>
<p>This product, ATOM, is a patent-pending smartphone case which combines artificial intelligence with unlicensed White Space, the most powerful, efficient and fastest wireless data transport interface in the industry today.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM:</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Smartphones are ubiquitous, and so is the frustration resulting from dropped calls, physical damage, daily depleted batteries and lost phone chargers. Progress has been limited because it has been so daunting to give the devices the ability to sense their environment, quickly determine the accurate response, and then perform the appropriate action. This bottleneck has been caused by the inability to provide efficient, super-fast data transfer which is necessary for downloading large amounts of information and responding quickly and accurately. We have solved this problem.</p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION TO PROBLEM</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We have developed a device which utilizes White Space, the most powerful and efficient wireless data transport interface in the industry today. This open source platform redefines high-speed wireless and will profoundly change our home and work lives, how we interact with technology, and our standard of living.</p>
<p>Media Li²ght Entertainment’s technological breakthrough is our extremely small, highly integrated, low power 60GHz single-chip mm-wave radio transceiver, compliant with the WiGig 1.1 and IEEE 802.11ad specifications. It can be embedded into various objects and devices and allows the open source White Space controller to communicate with our devices to transport data onto a 7G 60GHz ""millimetre wave"" spectrum.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><a href=""http://media-li2ght.com/aereo.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO SEE HOW IT WORKS</a></p>
<p>This high performance allows the device to support all WiGig protocol application layers (PALs) and facilitates energy efficiency greater than 300pJ/bit, enabling wireless transfer of audio and video data at up to 5-25 gigabits per second – twenty times the current maximum wireless transfer rate. It is ideal for high bandwidth robotic mobile applications such as screen mirroring in full1080p HD.</p>
<p>We have also included a second WLAN chain and antenna which improves RF performance, providing large antenna gain and virtually eliminating dropped calls.</p>
<p>Moreover, we have incorporated carbon nanotube technology for more efficient energy usage and utilized a renewable micro energy cell that stores and harvests energy from ambient environment (radio frequency, magnetic, solar, heat and vibration) to dramatically reduce the number of times a smartphone needs to be manually re-charged.  With our technology your iPhone would need recharging every 48 hours instead of every 8 hours of normal usage. </p>
<p>Since White Space is unlicensed open-source platform, internet connections are free and you save money that you are currently paying for data packages, a savings of $70-$80 per month. </p>

</div>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>White Space is revolutionizing the wireless entertainment gaming industry. The unique property of the White Space frequency bands is its excellent propagation characteristics – signals can travel further and faster, carry a lot of information, are unaffected by weather and foliage, and can go through walls and penetrate nooks and crannies within any residential home.</div>
<div>
<p>The unlicensed 60 GHz band has been available for several years, but only now is it possible to implement devices in low cost SiGe BiCMOS and CMOS mobile technologies. The combination of low-cost implementation coupled with enormous spectrum makes 60 GHz ideal for CE cable replacement, rivaling the bandwidth of wired technologies such as USB 3.0, HDMI, PCIe or DisplayPort. The short wavelength means antennas (traditionally a large constraint on implementation size) can be very small, thus yielding a small footprint. In addition, at 60 GHz it possible to implement compact, highly directional antennas which improve performance and allow for frequency re-use and spatial diversity.</p>
<p>With your pledge, you have an opportunity to be part of a company on the cutting edge of consumer electronics. Media Li2ght is revolutionizing how we play, search for, interact with, and receive information in the world around us. We need your support to launch the first FCC-approved; White Space enabled entertainment and mobile gaming accessory in the consumer electronics marketplace.  </p>

SPEED: Technology of the future-our technological breakthrough of “7G” wireless digital signal enhancement improves range and reception, enabling wireless transfer of audio and video data at up to 25 gigabits per second – twenty times the current maximum wireless transfer rate. Our technology can interact with TV to provide entertainment/gaming capabilities that are unachievable with existing wireless technology. This includes data rates similar to existing wired standards, such as USB3.0, PCIe or HDMI, and the streaming of uncompressed wireless video concurrently to multiple displays. Sports games, arcade classics and mobile games just feel bigger and better on a TV screen than a smartphone.
INTEROPERABILITY: ATOM, the smartphone case of the future is an interoperable, high performance device that works seamlessly to connect people in the dynamic digital lifestyle. It provides wireless connectivity in the unlicensed 60 GHz band that ushers in a new generation of unprecedented bandwidth into the mobile consumer electronics industry.
EFFICIENCY: More efficient, with less consumption of power.
STYLE: Functional fashion. ATOM makes a stylish, fashionable statement that distinguishes its owner as being on the cutting edge. ATOM users are first adopters of this future technology and proud of it
SAFETY: Although debate rages about safety of using smartphones, there have been over 200 scientific studies that have linked electromagnetic radiation to brain cancer, salivary gland tumors, behavioral problems, migraines and vertigo. Until  the dust settles discretion is the better part of valor. Our case protects users from electromagnetic radiation. 
WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION UPDATE
Our ultimate goal is to have a net positive battery charge for the smartphone. Our definition of a net positive energy charge is that once you put your phone into the sleeve it never has to be recharged again. Our case creates a perpetual charge removing the need for using a wall outlet on a standard 120 Volt/60 Hz circuit using a plug adapter and a USB cable.  

How would you like to be part of a revolutionary shift in consumer electronic technology, one where technology learns and adapts to meet your individual needs instead of you learning how to use its features? After years of research and development, we have a product in the final stages of development that can fundamentally change the way we live and play.

This product, ATOM, is a patent-pending smartphone case which combines artificial intelligence with unlicensed White Space, the most powerful, efficient and fastest wireless data transport interface in the industry today.
PROBLEM:


Smartphones are ubiquitous, and so is the frustration resulting from dropped calls, physical damage, daily depleted batteries and lost phone chargers. Progress has been limited because it has been so daunting to give the devices the ability to sense their environment, quickly determine the accurate response, and then perform the appropriate action. This bottleneck has been caused by the inability to provide efficient, super-fast data transfer which is necessary for downloading large amounts of information and responding quickly and accurately. We have solved this problem.
SOLUTION TO PROBLEM


We have developed a device which utilizes White Space, the most powerful and efficient wireless data transport interface in the industry today. This open source platform redefines high-speed wireless and will profoundly change our home and work lives, how we interact with technology, and our standard of living.
Media Li²ght Entertainment’s technological breakthrough is our extremely small, highly integrated, low power 60GHz single-chip mm-wave radio transceiver, compliant with the WiGig 1.1 and IEEE 802.11ad specifications. It can be embedded into various objects and devices and allows the open source White Space controller to communicate with our devices to transport data onto a 7G 60GHz ""millimetre wave"" spectrum.


 
CLICK HERE TO SEE HOW IT WORKS
This high performance allows the device to support all WiGig protocol application layers (PALs) and facilitates energy efficiency greater than 300pJ/bit, enabling wireless transfer of audio and video data at up to 5-25 gigabits per second – twenty times the current maximum wireless transfer rate. It is ideal for high bandwidth robotic mobile applications such as screen mirroring in full1080p HD.
We have also included a second WLAN chain and antenna which improves RF performance, providing large antenna gain and virtually eliminating dropped calls.
Moreover, we have incorporated carbon nanotube technology for more efficient energy usage and utilized a renewable micro energy cell that stores and harvests energy from ambient environment (radio frequency, magnetic, solar, heat and vibration) to dramatically reduce the number of times a smartphone needs to be manually re-charged.  With our technology your iPhone would need recharging every 48 hours instead of every 8 hours of normal usage. 
Since White Space is unlicensed open-source platform, internet connections are free and you save money that you are currently paying for data packages, a savings of $70-$80 per month. 


A  WHITE SPACE WIRELESS BREAKTHROUGH:


The transition to digital TV on June 12th 2009 liberated vast amounts of wireless frequencies that can be used by anyone, for FREE! These newly available frequencies are collectively called White Space.
Find out the white spaces at your location!
""Super Wi-Fi,"" has resulted from the deployment of unused broadcast television spectrum and is being deployed in the US and generating significant interest in many countries around the world including China, India, Britain and Brazil.

White Space is revolutionizing the wireless entertainment gaming industry. The unique property of the White Space frequency bands is its excellent propagation characteristics – signals can travel further and faster, carry a lot of information, are unaffected by weather and foliage, and can go through walls and penetrate nooks and crannies within any residential home.

The unlicensed 60 GHz band has been available for several years, but only now is it possible to implement devices in low cost SiGe BiCMOS and CMOS mobile technologies. The combination of low-cost implementation coupled with enormous spectrum makes 60 GHz ideal for CE cable replacement, rivaling the bandwidth of wired technologies such as USB 3.0, HDMI, PCIe or DisplayPort. The short wavelength means antennas (traditionally a large constraint on implementation size) can be very small, thus yielding a small footprint. In addition, at 60 GHz it possible to implement compact, highly directional antennas which improve performance and allow for frequency re-use and spatial diversity.
With your pledge, you have an opportunity to be part of a company on the cutting edge of consumer electronics. Media Li2ght is revolutionizing how we play, search for, interact with, and receive information in the world around us. We need your support to launch the first FCC-approved; White Space enabled entertainment and mobile gaming accessory in the consumer electronics marketplace.  

Join us as we take a bold step into the future we have all been dreaming about.
Thank you.

The wireless revolution is here today, transforming our economy and changing the way we live. Wireless innovation will be a driving force in economic growth and job creation, which in turn will enable new breakthroughs in areas like robotics, health care, education, energy, and public safety.
Our technology promises to play important roles in all these industries. Having a robot companion may not be for everyone but you can still get a signal enhancement that improves range and reception and still a play a critical role in creating a better future by supporting the development of our project. 

White Space is going to revolutionize the wireless entertainment/gaming and robotic industry. While it has excellent propagation characteristics, complexity and other factors could be prohibitive barriers in certain applications. However, should these barriers be overcome, the long-term potential for white space is endless.
The reason these white space channels are so valuable—and why they were chosen for terrestrial television in the first place—is because their signals travel farther carry more information, are unaffected by weather and foliage, go through walls and penetrate all the nooks and crannies within the bowels of buildings.
FCC approval The Commission's Part 15 rules (47 C.F.R. 15.701 et seq.) require that unlicensed TV band devices (TVBDs) contact an authorized database system to obtain a list of channels that are authorized for operation (i.e., channels not protected for authorized radio services). Channel use authorizations are determined for a specific location.

                                        The egg-shaped OVO not only provides a stylish look, but also fulfills engineering purposes. Its vertical design allows room for a tilt WiFi module so that higher signal quality can be achieved. With a cantilever power button built at the bottom, the OVO also enables better usability – you can activate the device simply by pressing gently on its top, with no need to pinpoint your fingertip at a small switch.</p>

                                        We have completed two prototyping phases and solved most of the mechanical and electrical issues. Almost all of the components come from suppliers that we have closely worked with for years. We are conducting a detailed review with our tooling vendor and defining the PCB testing interface with our manufacturer. Our engineering samples are expected to come out in September, before we enter mass production in October. All we need is your support to make it happen!</p>

                                        We hear you. Our dream is to make watching online videos a simple enjoyment. After working in multimedia for years, we still could not find a device that is simple enough to our family and friends. So we decide to create our very own online video player, OVO, to build an easy connection to online videos on TV.

                                         




                                    Unique User Experience





                                        Just collect online videos with your smartphone via the OVO·Q, our mobile APP that collects, organizes, and shares videos from online media, while waiting for a bus, taking the MRT, or eating in a restaurant, and you are only one click away from enjoying selected videos comfortably on your sofa.

                                        It is also easy to share videos with the elderly and children at home, who only need to click on the OVO to play your videos. As parents, you can protect your kids from inappropriate content on the Internet by providing selected videos easily accessed by them.







                                    Absolute Convenience





                                        Our OVO provides many handy features so users would not be limited by space, time, or screen:

                                        OVO·Q Cloud Services


Autoplay: play selected online videos simply by pressing on the OVO.

Resuming: watch videos continuously at different locations. (Twin pack is recommended!)

Switch Play: switch video play between your handheld device and the OVO.


                                        OVO Features


Mirror Screen: mirror your screen to TV.

My Media: share media contents from your mobile device to TV.

Media Apps: play media contents to TV from 3rd party Media Apps, including DLNA-compliant and proprietary services. More content services will be provided, including Apps offering substantial Chinese videos.

OVO Remote and OVO Setting: turn your smartphone into a remote controller when playing selected videos on TV, or change your OVO hardware settings.




                                        Simplicity isn’t simple. But through the OVO network, watching online video can be a simple enjoyment.




                                    Beautiful Design from the Inside Out





                                        The egg-shaped OVO not only provides a stylish look, but also fulfills engineering purposes. Its vertical design allows room for a tilt WiFi module so that higher signal quality can be achieved. With a cantilever power button built at the bottom, the OVO also enables better usability – you can activate the device simply by pressing gently on its top, with no need to pinpoint your fingertip at a small switch.







                                    Open Collaboration


                                        We will provide OVO’s API for developers to build video linkage to the OVO·Q. While App or Web developers can add a function icon to their user interface, system integrators can utilize our product and services to meet their display needs in chain store, classroom, or digital signage applications. You are very much welcomed to be one of our OVO beta developers, and we are looking forward to discussing more exciting ideas with you!




                                    Hardware


We are almost READY and will enter Mass Production with Your Support!

                                        Designed in Taiwan, a place known for expertise in volume production of high-quality IT products worldwide, the OVO comes from joint efforts of top experts in design, mechanical engineering, and production since its early development.

                                        We have completed two prototyping phases and solved most of the mechanical and electrical issues. Almost all of the components come from suppliers that we have closely worked with for years. We are conducting a detailed review with our tooling vendor and defining the PCB testing interface with our manufacturer. Our engineering samples are expected to come out in September, before we enter mass production in October. All we need is your support to make it happen!



                                        Can you tell the differences in shape between the two eggs above? It illustrates our 'OVO Attitude'!

<p><strong>(Please use the Indiegogo share tools to help spread the word and tell your contacts on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and others! Thanks!)</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://www.emotiv.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Emotiv EPOC headset""><img alt=""Emotiv EPOC headset"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.robodance.com/indiegogo/emotiv-epoc-headset-small.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""Emotiv EPOC headset""/></a>Brain control interfaces</strong> are changing human computer action in exciting, profound new ways. One of the brightest and boldest engines driving this change is the affordable <a href=""http://www.emotiv.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Emotiv Lifesciences"">Emotiv</a> EPOC consumer EEG headset. This 14-electrode headset can detect facial gestures, head movements, even strong thoughts or feelings. The goal of the eSharp project is to bring this technology to the massive C# developer community with <strong>a powerful toolkit</strong> that wraps the power of the <strong>Emotiv SDK</strong> in a convenient, easy to use set of components and gadgets.</p>
<p>If the project reaches the top funding goal the toolkit will include the tools I created to support the <strong>Evernote Windows COM API</strong>, my favorite developer API of all time. Although <strong>you can combine the eSharp toolkit with any API or SDK you desire or your own custom C# code</strong>, take a moment to Imagine the extraordinary software apps you could develop when you combine the power of a brain control interface with the leading information management service!</p>
<p>This is the important part. As a modern software developer you know how vital a rich set of mature tools and solid use case examples can be to a software development project, especially since time is always scarce and deadlines are relentless. I am a veteran programmer that has spent the last few years developing applications for the <strong>Emotiv EPOC</strong>. I already have an existing toolkit for the EPOC written for Delphi 6 that <strong>dramatically reduces the time it takes to develop brain control applications</strong>, allowing me, and soon you, to concentrate on the fun and intriguing parts of the app instead of the Emotiv SDK. My affection for Delphi is as deep as the ocean but the reality is <strong>C#</strong> is also a terrific development environment and the dominant player in the PC desktop marketplace, so that's where I'm heading. The purpose of the eSharp project is to <strong>raise the funds needed to provide the time and tools necessary to port my existing toolkit in Delphi to C#</strong>.</p>
<h3>The Project Goal - Open Source C# Toolkit</h3>
<p><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/hh341490.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Microsoft Visual C#""><img alt=""Visual C#"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.robodance.com/indiegogo/visual-c-sharp-logo.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""Visual C#""/></a>The end result of the project will be a set of open source tools for C# ported directly from my existing Delphi toolkit. The <strong>open source</strong> license will be a <strong>liberal BSD style license</strong> instead of a license that requires you to take actions that you may not be able to comply with. It will be a ""<em>just use it</em>"" license instead of one that requires you to share your source code. If you get rich building the next killer app with brain control then you keep all the rewards.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Delivery Date</h3>
<p>The project will be delivered by the end of this year by December 31, 2012.</p>
<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
<p>My name is <strong>Robert Oschler</strong>, a veteran programmer with a passion for pushing the envelope of what computers and software can do. Please see the list of quotes about my work and myself at the bottom of this page. For a quick overview see this <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/technology/personaltech/04basics.html?_r=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""New York Times Article on Robert Oschler"">New York Times article</a> that talked about my work with robots and the Emotiv EPOC.  Also, you will find a wealth of comments about my work and myself near the bottom of this page.</p>
<p><a href=""http://sourceforge.net/potm/potm-2005-05.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""SourceForge Project Of The Month""><img alt=""SourceForge Project Of The Month"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.robodance.com/indiegogo/sourceforge-logo-on-white.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""SourceForge Project Of The Month""/></a>Robodance, the app mentioned in the article, used the same toolkit that is shown in the video and at the heart of the eSharp project. Later I added the ability to record movies of remote telepresence sessions directly to Evernote. Robodance won the prestigious <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/potm/potm-2005-05.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""SourceForge Project Of The Month"">Project Of The Month</a> award from <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""SourceForge"">SourceForge</a>, the largest open source respository on the web in May 2005.</p>
<h3>Detecting Facial Gestures</h3>
<p>eSharp contains a wealth of events that fire whenever the EPOC detects a facial gesture, so you can write apps that detect smiles, laughs, eye blinks, and more, opening the door to intriguing new apps that can change based on the users mood, or note when they have a positive or negative reaction to entertainment media like videos, pictures, etc., an example of this was shown in the project video. There is one easy to use event for when the facial gesture starts and another for when it stops, giving you all the information you need to react to a facial gesture when it begins and ends, or to note the exact time interval a facial gesture occurred in.</p>
<h3>Detecting Head Movement</h3>
<p>There are convenient events that fire whenever the EPOC detects head movement giving you easy access to the horizontal and vertical head movement change values. eSharp goes even further than the Emotiv SDK by providing higher level events that tell you when the user shakes their head YES or NO, which can be useful for EPOC based dialogs that prompt the user for action, or for creating applications that can tell when a user agrees or disagrees with the current content like during a Skype call, a watching video or speech, or anything else your imagination as a developer conjures up. It even has a built-in event for detecting a series of voluntary eye-blinks by the user, an effortless movement that can be used to trigger key actions in your software.</p>
<h3>Detecting Mood or Mental State</h3>
<p><a href=""http://emotiv.com/store/apps/applications/132/766"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Emotiv Brain Activity Map""><img alt=""Emotiv Brain Activity Map"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.robodance.com/indiegogo/emotiv-brain-activity-map.gif"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""Emotiv Brain Activity Map""/></a>You can even record or react to the user's mental state detecting key attributes like Frustration, Boredom, Engagement, and others. The eSharp component gives you easy access to those values from the provided events as shown in the YouTube example in the pitch video that combined mood detection with the Evernote API.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Detecting a Strong Thought or Feeling</h3>
<p>One of the most fascinating features of the EPOC headset is that it can be trained to detect a strong thought or feeling the user has and then detect or react to that thought or feeling when the user experiences it. The eSharp component provides a set of events that fire for each key event that occurs during the training process. More importantly, one of the many examples that will be provided as part of the project is how to use the component to do training and you can use that example to build your own code for your application.</p>
<h3>Extended Gadgets</h3>
<p>Included in the eSharp project as ""<strong>bump goals</strong>"" are a set of extended gadgets that make the development of key exciting brain control applications far easier. Each extended gadget will include full source under the same liberal license for the entire project, and will include a well documented example to help you use it.</p>
<h3> [$4000 level] <em>Bump Goal 1</em>: Tag Cloud Viewer</h3>
<p>If this level of funding is reached I will port the Tag Cloud Viewer gadget <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQRDZRV7KCM#t=2m27s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Tag Cloud Viewer"">shown in the pitch video</a> to C#. Alternative user interfaces require new programming idioms like the Tag Cloud Viewer. The Tag Cloud Viewer is an EPOC friendly way to display a list of choices to the user that is intuitive and visually engaging.</p>
<h3>[$5000 level] <em>Bump Goal 2</em>: Enhanced YouTube Video Player</h3>
<p>If this level of funding is reached I will port the Enhanced YouTube Video Player gadget <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQRDZRV7KCM#t=31s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""YouTube Player"">shown in the pitch video</a> to C#. This gadget makes it easy to load and control the play of YouTube videos while providing the information necessary for integration with eSharp, especially the current video location so you can tie various EPOC detections easily to the current video location.</p>
<h3>[$6000 level] <em>Bump Goal 3</em>: Evernote API component with ENML checker </h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.evernote.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Evernote""><img alt=""Evernote Logo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.robodance.com/evernote-logo.png"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;"" title=""Evernote Log""/></a>The grand prize. I will include a new component that provides fast convenient access to the <strong>Evernote COM API</strong>. As a bonus I will add a new feature that integrates the open source <a href=""http://xmlsoft.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""XmlLint"">XmlLint</a> utility. Evernote developers know that Evernote's ENML specification for notes added to a data store is very restrictive and the slightest error will trigger a parsing error. Currently you get back a blanket error when you create notes that does not tell where the problem lies. You then have to take the content of the note and run it past an XML checker like XmlLint to find out where the problem is. If this funding level is reached not only will I port over my Evernote API component that makes using the Evernote Windows COM API easier, <strong>I will add code to interface with XmlLint</strong>. There will be a debug flag that when set, will make the Evernote API component run the content of all notes submitted to the Evernote API through XmlLint and report any errors in detail so <strong>you can track down and eliminate ENML errors effortlessly</strong>.</p>

<p><em>--- Kat Hannaford staff writer at Gizmodo.</em></p></div>","The eSharp Project
(Please use the Indiegogo share tools to help spread the word and tell your contacts on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and others! Thanks!)
Brain control interfaces are changing human computer action in exciting, profound new ways. One of the brightest and boldest engines driving this change is the affordable Emotiv EPOC consumer EEG headset. This 14-electrode headset can detect facial gestures, head movements, even strong thoughts or feelings. The goal of the eSharp project is to bring this technology to the massive C# developer community with a powerful toolkit that wraps the power of the Emotiv SDK in a convenient, easy to use set of components and gadgets.
If the project reaches the top funding goal the toolkit will include the tools I created to support the Evernote Windows COM API, my favorite developer API of all time. Although you can combine the eSharp toolkit with any API or SDK you desire or your own custom C# code, take a moment to Imagine the extraordinary software apps you could develop when you combine the power of a brain control interface with the leading information management service!
This is the important part. As a modern software developer you know how vital a rich set of mature tools and solid use case examples can be to a software development project, especially since time is always scarce and deadlines are relentless. I am a veteran programmer that has spent the last few years developing applications for the Emotiv EPOC. I already have an existing toolkit for the EPOC written for Delphi 6 that dramatically reduces the time it takes to develop brain control applications, allowing me, and soon you, to concentrate on the fun and intriguing parts of the app instead of the Emotiv SDK. My affection for Delphi is as deep as the ocean but the reality is C# is also a terrific development environment and the dominant player in the PC desktop marketplace, so that's where I'm heading. The purpose of the eSharp project is to raise the funds needed to provide the time and tools necessary to port my existing toolkit in Delphi to C#.
The Project Goal - Open Source C# Toolkit
The end result of the project will be a set of open source tools for C# ported directly from my existing Delphi toolkit. The open source license will be a liberal BSD style license instead of a license that requires you to take actions that you may not be able to comply with. It will be a ""just use it"" license instead of one that requires you to share your source code. If you get rich building the next killer app with brain control then you keep all the rewards.
 
Delivery Date
The project will be delivered by the end of this year by December 31, 2012.
Who Am I?
My name is Robert Oschler, a veteran programmer with a passion for pushing the envelope of what computers and software can do. Please see the list of quotes about my work and myself at the bottom of this page. For a quick overview see this New York Times article that talked about my work with robots and the Emotiv EPOC.  Also, you will find a wealth of comments about my work and myself near the bottom of this page.
Robodance, the app mentioned in the article, used the same toolkit that is shown in the video and at the heart of the eSharp project. Later I added the ability to record movies of remote telepresence sessions directly to Evernote. Robodance won the prestigious Project Of The Month award from SourceForge, the largest open source respository on the web in May 2005.
Detecting Facial Gestures
eSharp contains a wealth of events that fire whenever the EPOC detects a facial gesture, so you can write apps that detect smiles, laughs, eye blinks, and more, opening the door to intriguing new apps that can change based on the users mood, or note when they have a positive or negative reaction to entertainment media like videos, pictures, etc., an example of this was shown in the project video. There is one easy to use event for when the facial gesture starts and another for when it stops, giving you all the information you need to react to a facial gesture when it begins and ends, or to note the exact time interval a facial gesture occurred in.
Detecting Head Movement
There are convenient events that fire whenever the EPOC detects head movement giving you easy access to the horizontal and vertical head movement change values. eSharp goes even further than the Emotiv SDK by providing higher level events that tell you when the user shakes their head YES or NO, which can be useful for EPOC based dialogs that prompt the user for action, or for creating applications that can tell when a user agrees or disagrees with the current content like during a Skype call, a watching video or speech, or anything else your imagination as a developer conjures up. It even has a built-in event for detecting a series of voluntary eye-blinks by the user, an effortless movement that can be used to trigger key actions in your software.
Detecting Mood or Mental State
You can even record or react to the user's mental state detecting key attributes like Frustration, Boredom, Engagement, and others. The eSharp component gives you easy access to those values from the provided events as shown in the YouTube example in the pitch video that combined mood detection with the Evernote API.
 
Detecting a Strong Thought or Feeling
One of the most fascinating features of the EPOC headset is that it can be trained to detect a strong thought or feeling the user has and then detect or react to that thought or feeling when the user experiences it. The eSharp component provides a set of events that fire for each key event that occurs during the training process. More importantly, one of the many examples that will be provided as part of the project is how to use the component to do training and you can use that example to build your own code for your application.
Extended Gadgets
Included in the eSharp project as ""bump goals"" are a set of extended gadgets that make the development of key exciting brain control applications far easier. Each extended gadget will include full source under the same liberal license for the entire project, and will include a well documented example to help you use it.
 [$4000 level] Bump Goal 1: Tag Cloud Viewer
If this level of funding is reached I will port the Tag Cloud Viewer gadget shown in the pitch video to C#. Alternative user interfaces require new programming idioms like the Tag Cloud Viewer. The Tag Cloud Viewer is an EPOC friendly way to display a list of choices to the user that is intuitive and visually engaging.
[$5000 level] Bump Goal 2: Enhanced YouTube Video Player
If this level of funding is reached I will port the Enhanced YouTube Video Player gadget shown in the pitch video to C#. This gadget makes it easy to load and control the play of YouTube videos while providing the information necessary for integration with eSharp, especially the current video location so you can tie various EPOC detections easily to the current video location.
[$6000 level] Bump Goal 3: Evernote API component with ENML checker 
The grand prize. I will include a new component that provides fast convenient access to the Evernote COM API. As a bonus I will add a new feature that integrates the open source XmlLint utility. Evernote developers know that Evernote's ENML specification for notes added to a data store is very restrictive and the slightest error will trigger a parsing error. Currently you get back a blanket error when you create notes that does not tell where the problem lies. You then have to take the content of the note and run it past an XML checker like XmlLint to find out where the problem is. If this funding level is reached not only will I port over my Evernote API component that makes using the Evernote Windows COM API easier, I will add code to interface with XmlLint. There will be a debug flag that when set, will make the Evernote API component run the content of all notes submitted to the Evernote API through XmlLint and report any errors in detail so you can track down and eliminate ENML errors effortlessly.
Conclusion
Brain control apps are a fantastic new field of software development that borders on the surreal. With your help we can spread this revolutionary new technology to countless new people by enabling the army of C# developers around the world. If you are a C# developer yourself looking to jump in on the fun and the lucrative opportunities this new technology is creating, then here's a chance to get started quickly while taking a big chunk out of the learning curve. Better yet, you'll get the source code so you'll have the peace of mind of knowing that there are no barriers to your creativity if you decide to take it further or need to fix any bugs.

Our Indiegogo journey is almost over...

We owe a lot to our backers and to Indiegogo. With a great early response we had fantastic feedback which had substantial focus on the branding aspect of our product and many people looking to work with us to develop that market and international distribution channels. This had a great impact on our business plan and shifted our focus away from driving the Indiegogo campaign, but we couldn't be happier with how our business has evolved thanks to this in the most important early learning stages.
Echo will soon be found for sale in a choice of colours in countries all over the world, with more products to launch later in the year, which we will surely be launching again on Indiegogo with more focus and dedication.

Until then, there are a few days left for any last minute buyers at discount prices. After this you can find us on our website, and other sales channels such as eBay and Amazon.
Thank you all, it's been a great experience and we can't wait to see what the future holds for Echo!

<h3>What is MultiROM?</h3>
<p>MultiROM <a href=""http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2011403"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""MultiROM's XDA thread."">(XDA Thread)</a> is one-of-a-kind multi-boot mod for Nexus 7. It can boot any Android ROM available for that device as well as other systems like Ubuntu Touch, Plasma Active, Bohdi Linux or WebOS port. Besides booting from device's internal memory, MultiROM can boot from USB drive connected to the device via OTG cable.</p>
<p>The main part of MultiROM is a boot manager, which appears every time your device starts and lets you choose ROM to boot. You can see how it looks on the left image below and in gallery.</p>
<p>ROMs are installed and managed via modified <a href=""http://teamw.in/project/twrp2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TeamWin Recovery Project</a>. You can use standard ZIP files to install secondary Android ROMs, daily prebuilt image files to install Ubuntu Touch and MultiROM even has its <a href=""https://github.com/Tasssadar/multirom/tree/nexus7/installer"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">own installer system</a>, which can be used to ship other Linux-based systems.</p>
<p><img alt=""Multirom - boot manager and recovery"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/hubXIXa.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Multirom - boot manager and recovery""/></p>
<h2> It is already done and working...</h2>
<p>...but for different device. MultiROM for older version of Nexus 7 (2012) is working like a charm, and already has hundreds of users. Feel free to browse <a href=""http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2011403"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the XDA thread</a> or YouTube for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Nexus+7+multirom"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">all the MultiROM videos</a>. It is even mentioned on the <a href=""https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Nexus7/Installation#Having_both_Android_and_Ubuntu_installed_for_dual_boot"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">official wiki page</a> for Ubuntu Core on Nexus 7. And Linux Journal <a href=""http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/multi-booting-nexus-7-tablet"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">has an article</a> about it!</p>
<p>However, this is only one device. I would love to continue improving MultiROM and port it to other devices, which is why this campaign exists.</p>
<h2>What is this funding for?</h2>
<p>This campaign is only to buy test devices, the first one being the new Nexus 7 (2013). I love to work with Android devices and I want MultiROM to support multiple devices, so countless hours spent developing the project aren't covered by this campaign, but the devices are unfortunatelly a bit too expensive for me as a student.</p>
<p>MultiROM will be ported to all devices funded by this campaign and they will be used to further improve not only MultiROM, but also TWRP and some other projects - for example new Nexus 7 needs somebody to port and maintain Ubuntu Touch, I could probably do that.</p>
<p>$500 target* is for second generation Nexus 7 device and it's shipping to Czech Republic. If this campaign raises more money, it will be used to buy another test devices - which ones depends on the total amount of money and I suppose some kind of survey would be appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>This campaign is using fixed funding - if it doesn't reach the target, you'll get full refund within 5 days.</strong></p>
<p>*Indiegogo's minimal target is $500.</p>
<h2>When it will be ready?</h2>
<p>If this campaign gets funded and everything goes okay, MultiROM for second-gen N7 should be ready in about a month after I receive the device. If any other devices are funded, their versions should follow shortly after.</p>
<h3>What needs to be done?</h3>
<p>While the code is working for 1st-gen Nexus 7, there are some parts which need to be modified, namely screen drawing code and storage-related parts. The modified TWRP recovery will probably also need a lot of work, since that wasn't made with multiple devices in mind.</p>
<p>My goal is to have shared codebase for all devices MultiROM supports, the same way TWRP does it. This would potentially enable easy porting to different devices.</p>
<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>My name is Vojtěch Boček, I'm 18 years old and I live in <a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps?q=brno,+Czech+Republic&amp;hl=cs&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;sll=49.19506,16.606837&amp;sspn=0.391277,1.056747&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=Brno,+%C4%8Cesk%C3%A1+republika&amp;z=11"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brno, Czech Republic</a>.

The main part of MultiROM is a boot manager, which appears every time your device starts and lets you choose ROM to boot. You can see how it looks on the left image below and in gallery.
ROMs are installed and managed via modified TeamWin Recovery Project. You can use standard ZIP files to install secondary Android ROMs, daily prebuilt image files to install Ubuntu Touch and MultiROM even has its own installer system, which can be used to ship other Linux-based systems.

 It is already done and working...
...but for different device. MultiROM for older version of Nexus 7 (2012) is working like a charm, and already has hundreds of users. Feel free to browse the XDA thread or YouTube for all the MultiROM videos. It is even mentioned on the official wiki page for Ubuntu Core on Nexus 7. And Linux Journal has an article about it!
However, this is only one device. I would love to continue improving MultiROM and port it to other devices, which is why this campaign exists.
What is this funding for?
This campaign is only to buy test devices, the first one being the new Nexus 7 (2013). I love to work with Android devices and I want MultiROM to support multiple devices, so countless hours spent developing the project aren't covered by this campaign, but the devices are unfortunatelly a bit too expensive for me as a student.
MultiROM will be ported to all devices funded by this campaign and they will be used to further improve not only MultiROM, but also TWRP and some other projects - for example new Nexus 7 needs somebody to port and maintain Ubuntu Touch, I could probably do that.
$500 target* is for second generation Nexus 7 device and it's shipping to Czech Republic. If this campaign raises more money, it will be used to buy another test devices - which ones depends on the total amount of money and I suppose some kind of survey would be appropriate.
This campaign is using fixed funding - if it doesn't reach the target, you'll get full refund within 5 days.
*Indiegogo's minimal target is $500.
When it will be ready?
If this campaign gets funded and everything goes okay, MultiROM for second-gen N7 should be ready in about a month after I receive the device. If any other devices are funded, their versions should follow shortly after.
What needs to be done?
While the code is working for 1st-gen Nexus 7, there are some parts which need to be modified, namely screen drawing code and storage-related parts. The modified TWRP recovery will probably also need a lot of work, since that wasn't made with multiple devices in mind.
My goal is to have shared codebase for all devices MultiROM supports, the same way TWRP does it. This would potentially enable easy porting to different devices.
Who am I?
My name is Vojtěch Boček, I'm 18 years old and I live in Brno, Czech Republic. I'm middle-school student and a young programmer who likes to play with small devices carrying any type of processor, be it ARM phone and tablets or small robots which play chess.
You can find all my projects on my github page or my website, these are the most important:


MultiROM for Nexus 7

Lorris Toolbox - very useful development tool for anybody who works with robots or any other microchip applications

VNote - simple, but surprisingly widely adopted note application which can open .vnt files used by older dumbphones.
I also contribute to TeamWin Recovery Project. For example scrollbars in file manager and highlights after button press are my work. I ported TWRP 2.6 to LG Optimus One, too.
