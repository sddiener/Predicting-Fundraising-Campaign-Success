<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Crafty Devil Brewing Company.  Founded by two best mates Rhys Watkins &amp; Adam Edinborough in 2014 in Rhys's garden shed. Since then the brewery has grown beyond our wildest dreams employing both Adam &amp; Rhys, 2 more full time staff and 7 part time. The brewery is now producing 2000 litres of beer a week.  In October 2015 we also opened our first venue the Crafty Devil Cellar a small bar and shop in the suburb of Canton in West Cardiff. We are proud to be a Cardiff craft brewery in the City where we have grown up.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Canned in Cardiff is the next step in our journey. Allowing us to make more beer, by expanding the brewery capacity, and most importantly can our own beer!</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>When we started the Brewery we had the dream of being totally independent allowing us the freedom to create whatever we wanted, whenever we wanted to. By contributing to this you would be helping us realise this dream.</span><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> </span></p>
<p>Having control over the canning process will allow us to be more innovative by making sure our one  off and small batch brews make it into cans and out into the world. Our beer will be canned at it's freshest and totally under our control.This campaign will also enable us to move the brewery to a better facility with a secure lease. Helping us grow quickly and reach more customers, making sure the product that reaches them is a fair reflection of our passion and hard work. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking for £83,000 to fund this exciting project this will be the breakdown of costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cask Canning Line £38,000</li>
<li>Labelling Machine £9,000</li>
<li>New pressure tank £5,000</li>
<li>Building Work/Working Capital £31,000</li>
</ul>
<p>As a supporter of our campaign there are a series of great perks for you including:</p>
<ul>
<li>An invite to Crafty Devil's Annual Party including beer!</li>
<li>A number of limited edition Canned In Cardiff Cans (The First Beer off the new Canning Line)</li>
<li>'Another Brick In the Wall....Wall' Your name on a Brick at the new Brewery</li>
<li>Life Discounts off Crafty Devil Beers &amp; Merch</li>
<li>A Year of Beer!</li>
<li>Plus Many more.......</li>
</ul>
<p>If we do not reach our entire goal we have the option to purchase a manual canning machine which is slower but will still allow us to can onsite. We would also need to reconsider how we fund the associated building works.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is valuable to the Crafty Devil customer as it will keep us fiercely independent and loyal to them, making sure we provide them with new and exciting beer with ever increasing quality at an affordable price. An increased range of beers will be available in can to take away and to a wider audience. It will also create local jobs, contributing to the wider economy. The environmental impact will also be positive with none of the current haulage needed to transfer beer, cutting our carbon footprint.</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>We have managed to build Crafty Devil Brewing from the ground up with no external funding, calling on family and friends. The business now employs 9 members of staff all on the 'real' living wage or above. It is now time to move the business on to the next level and that is where you come in!</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>We are a proud local craft brewery who believe in the community we have been involved in many charity projects and try to give back as much as we can. We have a loyal following which is amazing and we believe this is testament to our project and the trust we have built.</span></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The value of this project carries risks and challenges to us. There is a risk that the demand for our product does not meet our new capacity. In addition to this the building works could cost more than anticipated. We have mitigated this by courting new customers who are interested in buying our cans in large volumes. We have also appointed a trusted builder who will do the required work locating the brewery in the new premises.</p>
<p>The challenges we have include project managing the works and ensuring time frames are kept to. We will meet these challenges through project discipline and a realistic time frame. Also, Adam was in construction and Rhys was a Project Manager in a their former lives!</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Giving us money is not the only way you can help! We need all you Crafty Devils to share our campaign and get in touch if you can help in any other way. Indiegogo has share tools you can also use to get the word out.</p>

<h3>Notre Petite Histoire</h3>
<p>En 2015, nous nous sommes rencontrées à l’école de théâtre et ce fut une évidence pour toutes les deux qu'un jour, nous allions partir en entreprise ensemble; c'est à ce moment que naquit la première ébauche de cette compagnie. </p>
<p>Après mille et une péripéties et formations acquises, nous avons revues nos idées et créé un concept unique qui rassemble tous nos besoins et désirs. Il était clair que nous voulions un espace rempli d'art et d'artistes, un espace dans lequel ils se sentiraient chez-eux et pourraient produire librement. Nous avions envie de créer un sentiment familial et envie d’unifier les artistes dans un même lieu, c’est ainsi que l’ATELIER TENTACULAIRE est né. </p>
<p>Ainsi L'Atelier Tentaculaire se veux être une entreprise locale dont la vocation est de promouvoir les artiste émergents et de les unir autour de créations communes mise à l'avant dans nos lieux. De jour, L'Atelier T sera aussi un café où breuvages et nourritures seront offerts . De soir, l'endroit se changera en un bar artistique avec une salle de spectacles  où seront présentés nos divers artistes de la scène dans une programmation variée et soigneusement conçue.</p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In 2015, we met at the theater school and it was obvious for both of us that one day, we were going to go open a business together; it was at this time that the first draft of this company was born.</p>
<p>After a thousand adventures and acquired training, we have reviewed our ideas and created a unique concept that brings together all our needs and desires. It was clear that we wanted a space filled with art and artists, a space in which they would feel at home and could produce freely. We wanted to create a family feeling and wanted to unite the artists in the same place, this is how the TENTACULAR WORKSHOP (L'Atelier Tentaculaire) was born. Thus wants to be a local company whose vocation is to promote emerging artists and to unite them around common creations put forward in our places.</p>
<p>During the day, L'Atelier T will also be a café where beverages and foods will be offered. In the evening, the place will change into an artistic bar with a stage where our various performing artists will be presented in a varied and carefully designed program.</p>

<h3>Nos Défis</h3>

En d'autres mots, nous souhaitons rendre l'art plus accessible à tous et l'éloigner du cadre rigide institutionnel qui empêche les artistes de rayonner à leur plein potentiel. Par ailleurs, nous désirons nous inscrire dans les débat sociaux actuels et amener sur le marché une entreprise qui réfléchie différemment et qui est centrée autours de sa clientèle et de ses employés. De plus, nous voulons avoir une consommation éco-responsable, ce qui peut être difficile dans le domaine artistique. Ainsi, nous voulons mettre de l'avant et éduquer notre clientèle sur l'usage intelligent de nos matériaux, pour permettre à tous de diminuer notre emprunte écologique. </p>
<p>Éventuellement, nous allons développer des partenariat avec des entreprises de recyclage de matière toxiques, suite à la quantité de produit nocifs qui se retrouve dans les divers médium d'art. En plus, nous prioriseront les produits qui respecte l'environnement et le commerce équitable, et ce, dans tous nos secteurs d'activités. Le composte, le recyclage et la réutilisation seront au cœur de nos priorités en tant qu'entreprise. </p>
<p>Le contexte actuel de l'industrie nécessite que nous mettions en place un système d'éducation à cette consommation intelligente. </p>
<h3>Our Challenges</h3>
<p>Our goal with L'Atelier tentaculaire is to democratize art in Quebec. In other words, we want to make art more accessible to everyone and move away from the rigid institutional framework that restreint artists to reach their full potential. In addition, we want to be part of current social debates and bring to the market a company that thinks differently and that is centered around its customers and employees. In addition, we want to have an eco-responsible consumption, which can be difficult in the artistic field. Thus, we want to put forward and educate our customers on the intelligent use of our materials, to allow everyone to reduce our ecological footprint.</p>
<p>Eventually, we will develop a partnership with companies that recycle toxic materials, due to the quantity of harmful products found in various art mediums. In addition, we will prioritize products that respect the environment and fair trade, in all our sectors of activity. Compost, recycling and reuse will be at the heart of our priorities as a company.</p>
<p>The current context of the industry requires that we set up an education system for this intelligent consumption.</p>

<p></p>
<h4><b></b></h4>
<p>There are so many reasons for the jewelry industry to come
together to collaborate on goals and principles, not the least of
which is we are faced with growing demands from banks, NGOs and governments. In
addition, the Millenials are coming! And though they still like the shiny and
beautiful objects of our industry, their buying decisions are grounded in
social and environmental justice. </p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s time for us to self-organize and
self-manage our industry to address positive social and environmental outcomes;
if we don’t, all the outside influencers will do it for us – which just might
put us out of business. This summit is about coming together to collaborate on
identifying shared goals and developing tools and practices that can help us
achieve those goals over time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you’re in the jewelry business - anywhere
along the supply chain – we want your voice in the conversation. Part of
funding the summit is simply registering for the event in March! Join
your colleagues in taking the lead on making jewelry a sustainable, even
resilient business!</p>
<p>Read on further for our mission statement and the goals of the summit.</p>
<br/><div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<h4><b>Mission Statement </b></h4>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our
community of individuals from all sectors in the jewelry industry seeks at the
summit to develop a shared vision to meet the challenges, to sustain our
business and to improve the supply chain for our products. The purpose of the
summit is to discuss challenges and opportunities in the jewelry industry that
can better support everyone in the supply chain.</span></p>
<p><br/></p>

</div></div>","There are so many reasons for the jewelry industry to come
together to collaborate on goals and principles, not the least of
which is we are faced with growing demands from banks, NGOs and governments. In
addition, the Millenials are coming! And though they still like the shiny and
beautiful objects of our industry, their buying decisions are grounded in
social and environmental justice. 

It’s time for us to self-organize and
self-manage our industry to address positive social and environmental outcomes;
if we don’t, all the outside influencers will do it for us – which just might
put us out of business. This summit is about coming together to collaborate on
identifying shared goals and developing tools and practices that can help us
achieve those goals over time.

If you’re in the jewelry business - anywhere
along the supply chain – we want your voice in the conversation. Part of
funding the summit is simply registering for the event in March! Join
your colleagues in taking the lead on making jewelry a sustainable, even
resilient business!
Read on further for our mission statement and the goals of the summit.


Mission Statement 
Our
community of individuals from all sectors in the jewelry industry seeks at the
summit to develop a shared vision to meet the challenges, to sustain our
business and to improve the supply chain for our products. The purpose of the
summit is to discuss challenges and opportunities in the jewelry industry that
can better support everyone in the supply chain.

Goal: The goal of the summit is to develop a set of guiding principles towards which businesses can voluntarily progress to achieve best practices. After the summit, tools can be developed to assist industry members to set goals and achieve improvement in meeting the goals developed by consensus. A positive result of the widely attended and public forum will be to demonstrate to governments, civil society, to the banking community and to consumers that the industry is pro-actively engaging in creating a positive environment to benefit everyone in the supply chain and is doing so in a manner that allows access for all companies to voluntarily engage at all levels.
Format: A two and ½ day industry wide event, professionally facilitated, open to all. Located centrally in New York, NY, we plan to host this event during the month of March 2016 immediately preceding the JA/NY trade show. Attendees will be from every sector of the international trade from producers to retailers, and everyone in between, and from all sectors, including precious metals, color gemstones and diamonds.

Program: The program will include education on current challenges in all sectors of the industry, information on supply chain integrity systems already in place, and a review of current expectations of government regulators, banks that finance the industry and consumers regarding responsible business practices. 

The summit will be an interactive and facilitated discussion
about important industry issues pertaining to business practices and the supply
chain with the goal of ensuring that the jewelry industry will thrive in the
21st Century. 
Participants will include members of the diamond, colored gem and
precious metal industries, trade associations, financial institutions, as well
as those in the international communities. They will have the opportunity to
shape the outcome of the discussions, and to develop tools to ensure that the
industry can support the entire supply chain.

<h3>Thank you for checking out my Campaign!</h3>
<p>I am Markella Smith, Community Organizer, Entrepreneur, Mother to 3 amazing boys and a Lifelong North Minneapolis Resident!</p>
<p>I am a strong believer in the power of the village and the idea that community often already has all that it needs to thrive and with a little support, amazing things can happen! As an entrepreneur myself, I've been able to take a skill I learned from my grandmother and turn into a business that has helped sustain my family through the years.</p>
<p>Fast Forward to 2020, COVID hits, and Community Markets and Vendor Events are canceled. Stores are closing left and right, leaving so many artists and makers without a place to sell their wares! More than ever, a central place to sell giftable items and somewhere people could intentionally shop local and support local was needed. And that's where the vision of having a central gift shop where local artists, makers and entrepreneurs not only have a permanent space to sell their items, but community members have a central place to connect, came to life.</p>
<p>This gift shop will essentially be a small business incubator with a village feel, where community members can come get business advice and support from someone who looks like them and lives in the same community as them. A community member could potentially walk in the door with an idea, and walk out with a plan of action to get their items displayed in the shop. A space that supports and encourages BIPOC Artists, Entrepreneurs and Makers to go after their dreams and obtain greatness. </p>
<p>This space will also feature a space of holistic healing and togetherness that represents the people who live within the community.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>The full goal of this campaign is $10,000! This $10,000 will help transform a vacant store front space into a beautiful gift shop, one that the North Minneapolis more than deserves!</p>
<p>You contributions will be used in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security System and Cameras for the space</li>
<li>Exterior Painting and brightening up the corner</li>
<li>Shelving and a space divider to separate the gift shop from the community event space.</li>
<li>Aesthetics for the Gift shop &amp; the Community Space so that it is warm and welcoming!</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if we do not reach my entire goal all funds raised will be used to get the space functioning and get the shop open.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution is a chance to make a real impact in a community that is under served and undervalued. North Minneapolis has long been disinvested in and as a community of mostly BIPOC individuals this is a chance to help bring the concept of building Generational Wealth through entrepreneurship into the community!</p>
<p>The Gift Shop will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a space for us by us, where we can cultivate dreams and turn them into reality.</li>
<li>Offer trainings and support to businesses and individuals to help build out branding and professional business appearance with labeling and displays. </li>
<li>Give community the opportunity to support local business and help stimulate the local business economy!</li>
<li>Employ people from the community (mostly teens) and circulate money back into the community through the consignment of products!</li>
<li>Feature a space of holistic healing and togetherness that represents the people who live within the community.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Every business idea comes with some risks, and let's face it, COVID let us see just how challenging the retail world could be, but the last year has taught me how to pivot and the nice thing about The Dream Shop is that it gives other makers, businesses and artists a place to keep sales coming in year round! And if something happens where the physical location needs to shut down or close for  a while... well that's where our online platform will come in to play! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Can't contribute financially but want to help in some way?</p>

<h3>FROM THE OWNER...</h3>
<p><i>*DISCLAIMER!!! Money is a touchy subject to many people. It may even offend you that we're asking for contributions. So I want to say <strong>NO ONE IS UNDER ANY OBLIGATION WHATSOEVER.</strong> This campaign is to reach people who WANT to be a part of our business. And we are offering incentives as well, so people who donate $50 or more are essentially buying a year-long discount card to use whenever they'd like. Plus there's merch. Plus there's this whole Wall of Honor thing. Plus... You get the idea. So let's jump in!</i></p>

<h3>The Short &amp; Sweet</h3>
<p>We're moving, expanding our inventory and enhancing the whole shopping experience at Callahan's! Same beautiful staff, same core values... but with a <strong><i>NEW</i> </strong>Dix Ave location, <strong><i>NEW</i> </strong>sources for liquidation merchandise, and <strong><i>NEW </i></strong>ways to save money. Also - <strong>DREW IS COMING BACK!</strong> I've been on hiatus while working on some other projects but now I will personally be in charge of sourcing, marketing, customer relations and most importantly COMMUNITY IMPACT, meaning- finding creative and fun ways to give back to our neighbors in need. There's no point owning a business if it doesn't help people. You need to have a purpose.</p>
<p>We're locals through and through. This is our town and you are our people... and we plan to be here for a long time doing WHAT we love with the PEOPLE we love. To do that we need to grow and evolve, and to do that... well, we need YOU.</p>
<p>This is a growth campaign. We're asking for the support of our people to get over some of the financial hurdles that stand in the way of a really awesome and fulfilling future. A golden opportunity came knocking and we answered, knowing it was by far the best path forward for our little business. That's the broad stroke. Now the details... </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get </h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><i>Short</i> </strong>answer: We need a minimum of <u><strong>$20k</strong></u> to relocate seamlessly, although anything above that certainly won't go to waste! The more we raise, the better equipped the store can be and the cooler the merchandise can be. You can join the Callahan Clan as a contributing member and get a year's worth of discounts on our sweet merch. Increasing levels of contribution will come with increasing levels of membership and perks. Read on!</li>
<li>
<strong><i>Long</i> </strong>answer... Moving is no small or inexpensive matter, especially for a business that operates within microscopic margins. We've kept our promise to keep prices low but that means we ride a fine line. In order to KEEP keeping our promise we need to keep overhead down. In order to do THAT we need some growth capital. Here are some of the costs of moving...<ul>
<li>
<strong>ELBOW GREASE</strong>: The new building was an auto-body shop... need I say more?  It takes some serious spit-shine to polish... well, ACTUAL grease. We're demolishing walls, refinishing floors, renovating this and that, cleaning, painting, and turning a messy ol' garage into a shiny yet functional retail store. Feng shui ain't free!</li>
<li>
<strong>LABOR:</strong> Employees appreciate paychecks, even when the store's not making any money (like say- during a big labor intensive relocation project!)</li>
<li>
<strong>MARKETING:</strong> People need to know! And we need to hit the ground running. Radio, mail, and even Facebook can be expensive... but as they say <i>""You need to spend money to make money.""</i>
</li>
<li>
<strong>SHELVING &amp; DISPLAYS: </strong>New store; new layout; new displays. We're thrifty and we'll reuse whatever we can but there's no way to avoid some store display purchases.</li>
<li>
<strong>UTILITIES: </strong>Can't avoid the overlap. Paying utilities at two locations until the clean break is made AND putting down deposits on the new accounts. </li>
<li>
<strong>MERCHANDISE: </strong>Keeping up with regular supply and demand is a challenge in and of itself... But stocking a vacant warehouse CHOCK full of merch in the course of several weeks; well that's a logistical nightmare to say the least!</li>
<li>
<strong>SUPPLIES &amp; EQUIPMENT:</strong> our point of sale system is old and slow (kinda like how I feel in the mornings) but we can't slow down! Not in this industry. So we need new hardware. And we need shopping carts that don't squeak and wobble and veer off to the left. And we need new business cards, and we need to build a new checkout counter... get the idea?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

FROM THE OWNER...
*DISCLAIMER!!! Money is a touchy subject to many people. It may even offend you that we're asking for contributions. So I want to say NO ONE IS UNDER ANY OBLIGATION WHATSOEVER. This campaign is to reach people who WANT to be a part of our business. And we are offering incentives as well, so people who donate $50 or more are essentially buying a year-long discount card to use whenever they'd like. Plus there's merch. Plus there's this whole Wall of Honor thing. Plus... You get the idea. So let's jump in!

The Short & Sweet
We're moving, expanding our inventory and enhancing the whole shopping experience at Callahan's! Same beautiful staff, same core values... but with a NEW Dix Ave location, NEW sources for liquidation merchandise, and NEW ways to save money. Also - DREW IS COMING BACK! I've been on hiatus while working on some other projects but now I will personally be in charge of sourcing, marketing, customer relations and most importantly COMMUNITY IMPACT, meaning- finding creative and fun ways to give back to our neighbors in need. There's no point owning a business if it doesn't help people. You need to have a purpose.
We're locals through and through. This is our town and you are our people... and we plan to be here for a long time doing WHAT we love with the PEOPLE we love. To do that we need to grow and evolve, and to do that... well, we need YOU.
This is a growth campaign. We're asking for the support of our people to get over some of the financial hurdles that stand in the way of a really awesome and fulfilling future. A golden opportunity came knocking and we answered, knowing it was by far the best path forward for our little business. That's the broad stroke. Now the details... 

What We Need & What You Get 


Short answer: We need a minimum of $20k to relocate seamlessly, although anything above that certainly won't go to waste! The more we raise, the better equipped the store can be and the cooler the merchandise can be. You can join the Callahan Clan as a contributing member and get a year's worth of discounts on our sweet merch. Increasing levels of contribution will come with increasing levels of membership and perks. Read on!

Long answer... Moving is no small or inexpensive matter, especially for a business that operates within microscopic margins. We've kept our promise to keep prices low but that means we ride a fine line. In order to KEEP keeping our promise we need to keep overhead down. In order to do THAT we need some growth capital. Here are some of the costs of moving...

ELBOW GREASE: The new building was an auto-body shop... need I say more?  It takes some serious spit-shine to polish... well, ACTUAL grease. We're demolishing walls, refinishing floors, renovating this and that, cleaning, painting, and turning a messy ol' garage into a shiny yet functional retail store. Feng shui ain't free!

LABOR: Employees appreciate paychecks, even when the store's not making any money (like say- during a big labor intensive relocation project!)

MARKETING: People need to know! And we need to hit the ground running. Radio, mail, and even Facebook can be expensive... but as they say ""You need to spend money to make money.""


SHELVING & DISPLAYS: New store; new layout; new displays. We're thrifty and we'll reuse whatever we can but there's no way to avoid some store display purchases.

UTILITIES: Can't avoid the overlap. Paying utilities at two locations until the clean break is made AND putting down deposits on the new accounts. 

MERCHANDISE: Keeping up with regular supply and demand is a challenge in and of itself... But stocking a vacant warehouse CHOCK full of merch in the course of several weeks; well that's a logistical nightmare to say the least!

SUPPLIES & EQUIPMENT: our point of sale system is old and slow (kinda like how I feel in the mornings) but we can't slow down! Not in this industry. So we need new hardware. And we need shopping carts that don't squeak and wobble and veer off to the left. And we need new business cards, and we need to build a new checkout counter... get the idea?




The Impact
Hudson Falls will get a big cool liquidation warehouse run and operated BY locals FOR locals. Or non-locals... we don't care - come one, come all!  We love everybody =)  
Along with the move we're going to shift our focus back to the community where it belongs. My personal motto for this business is ""Never get greedy."" We want to give back to our neighbors and I have a lot of ideas to implement. 

Risks & Challenges
""Nothing risked, nothing gained.""
In some ways we're rolling the proverbial dice, in other ways we're leaning confidently on a known and proven system. Our business model works, Hudson Falls has accepted us as one of their own, and we know the industry inside and out, along with its pitfalls (some of which we've experienced firsthand).

<h2>The Origin of Puppyccino's</h2>
<p>It was another sweltering summer day at Zilker Park. Our Pyrenees-Husky pup trotted along close to us, but would never step into the sunlight. He'd lay waiting in the shadows for a cloud to roll across the sun before darting over to his next hiding place. He must have been no more than 3 months old, but all that puppy energy was drained by the Texas heat. Tera and I would patiently wait for him to rest before continuing our walk - the weather was just too exhausting for us. That may be the first moment we began to imagine doing things another way. The day we thought of Puppyccino's.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560999232/m2xm9sfa14nnhc4jykns.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Plan:</h3>
<p>Puppyccino's will be an indoor dog park and cafe where dog parents and their pups can socialize, play, and spend some time enjoying life together. We're not a replacement for your weekend hikes, evening walks, or days swimming in Barking Springs - we're an alternative for those stormy days and dreadful heatwaves. Maybe you have to dedicate some of your evening to work or you have finals coming up and just can't make it out with your pup - we're here for you.</p>
<h3>Fun Additions:</h3>
<p>We want to be your destination for an exciting day with your dog. We'll stay true to the Austin way by featuring beer brewed by local breweries, coffee roasted in-town, and wine from Texas wineries. We will work with other local businesses to bring you free dog yoga, movie nights with your pup, and special menus from hometown food trucks - including specially prepared food for canines.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Giving Back:</h3>
<p>Puppyccino's is taking on the mission of finding a home for as many shelter dogs as possible. We too often hear stories of dogs being abandoned, discarded, or neglected. They deserve much better and we'll give it to them. Puppyccino's is working with local rescues to set aside part of our space as a dedicated foster facility. This area will be connected but separated from the main play yard so these dogs feel safe and content. They'll be dubbed our cafe dogs and will be available for attention and adoption by anyone who applies to the appropriate rescue.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Full Story:</h3>
<p>My name is Steven ""Vince"" Parish. I'm a graduate of UT and a long-time Austin resident. Tera is a graduate from Tamkang University in Taiwan. We were inspired by our dog Nanuk to create Puppyccino's.</p>
<p>It was early 2018 when we started planning out our vision of what Puppyccino's will be. The concept has evolved from a food truck that serves coffee with a tented yard to the full-fledged dog cafe and indoor dog park we’re working toward today. We spent six months bouncing the idea off of every person we met at Austin's off-leash trails and dog parks. We collected targeted surveys to learn what the community needed, talked to baristas and cafe owners to find out what to expect, and worked with business professionals to construct a solid business plan.</p>
<p>We want Puppyccino's to change the way you spend time with your dog. We want it to be your Friday night and Sunday brunch destination where you can bring your dog AND they have fun on their visit. We want it to be the go-to place for inclement weather and those days your pup is feeling bored laying at home. Our business is happy dogs and happy dog parents.</p>
<p>We're offering all of this to you. Our model and our plan are solid. The last step is generating enough contributions to open the doors. We're reaching out to everyone that thought it was a great idea and really wants to see it become a reality. Please help us get there.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

It grew, through excited emails, reconnaissance trips and inter-continental video calls, into this: the refurbishment and renovation of a derelict mill in the stunning olive grove-lined hills of southern Montenegro. Built in 1860, and originally housing a soap factory and later an olive mill, this unique piece of Balkan history has been neglected and fallen into ruin and disrepair since the earthquake of 1979. </span><br/></p><p></p>
<p>Having cobbled together the funds to purchase the property, we are to transform it into a hub of creativity. Providing high end hostel/hotel accommodation in the form of private rooms and dormitory beds for those travelling through, the space will also host retreats, workshops and events. We cannot wait for you to visit, stay with us, and contribute to making this place what we know it can be.</p>

<p><b>The building and local area</b></p>
<p>Set in the picturesque town of Stari Bar, The Grove is conveniently tucked away from view beneath a towering 9th century fort, in a valley, next to an aqueduct, with a river running past our doorstep that powers a water wheel. Hiking trails leave from our backyard and meander up the peaks opposite. The silver-green of olive leaves shade the foothills, and fruit and nut trees fill gardens with abundance. The cobbled main street of Stari Bar has a decidedly friendly, local air, and the restaurants and cafes bustle in the warmth of early evening. For those after the ocean, we are 3km from the crystal clear Adriatic Sea - important, as Bar is one of Europe's sunniest cities.</p>
<p>The building sits on a substantial plot, however we were also able to secure a sizeable chunk of land at the rear of the property. This will be terraced, and used for cultivation of fruits and vegetables. </p>

<p>A small, unassuming country that never fails to surprise you. From the unspoilt, stunning beaches, to the breathtaking mountains, it is a remarkably beautiful land. Montenegrin is spoken, a Slavic language, and the Euro is the currency used. Friendlier folks you will be hard pressed to meet. Lake Skadar is an impressive body of water, located just over the hills from us. A bird watcher's paradise, it is an important draw to the region, and a site of significant European biodiversity. In a couple of hours by train you can be in Kolašin, skiing the slopes in winter, or hiking the alpine terrain in spring. The quaint walled towns of Kotor and Budva are easily reachable on relaxed day trips, over land or by sea.</p>
<p><b>Further Afield </b></p>
<p>What an inspiring area to find ourselves in. As a place to come and explore and be creative, we are ideally located at somewhat of a crossroads between East and West. There are ferry links twice weekly over to Bari in Italy, the route through Montenegro from Croatia to Albania (or vice versa) is a backpacker's dream, and there are direct trains through the mountains and over spectacular viaducts on the renowned Bar to Belgrade line.

It grew, through excited emails, reconnaissance trips and inter-continental video calls, into this: the refurbishment and renovation of a derelict mill in the stunning olive grove-lined hills of southern Montenegro. Built in 1860, and originally housing a soap factory and later an olive mill, this unique piece of Balkan history has been neglected and fallen into ruin and disrepair since the earthquake of 1979. 
Having cobbled together the funds to purchase the property, we are to transform it into a hub of creativity. Providing high end hostel/hotel accommodation in the form of private rooms and dormitory beds for those travelling through, the space will also host retreats, workshops and events. We cannot wait for you to visit, stay with us, and contribute to making this place what we know it can be.
For detailed information on the progress so far, video tours of the internals and to stay up to date, please visit http://thegrovemontenegro.blogspot.co.uk
The building and local area
Set in the picturesque town of Stari Bar, The Grove is conveniently tucked away from view beneath a towering 9th century fort, in a valley, next to an aqueduct, with a river running past our doorstep that powers a water wheel. Hiking trails leave from our backyard and meander up the peaks opposite. The silver-green of olive leaves shade the foothills, and fruit and nut trees fill gardens with abundance. The cobbled main street of Stari Bar has a decidedly friendly, local air, and the restaurants and cafes bustle in the warmth of early evening. For those after the ocean, we are 3km from the crystal clear Adriatic Sea - important, as Bar is one of Europe's sunniest cities.
The building sits on a substantial plot, however we were also able to secure a sizeable chunk of land at the rear of the property. This will be terraced, and used for cultivation of fruits and vegetables.

Montenegro 
A small, unassuming country that never fails to surprise you. From the unspoilt, stunning beaches, to the breathtaking mountains, it is a remarkably beautiful land. Montenegrin is spoken, a Slavic language, and the Euro is the currency used. Friendlier folks you will be hard pressed to meet. Lake Skadar is an impressive body of water, located just over the hills from us. A bird watcher's paradise, it is an important draw to the region, and a site of significant European biodiversity. In a couple of hours by train you can be in Kolašin, skiing the slopes in winter, or hiking the alpine terrain in spring. The quaint walled towns of Kotor and Budva are easily reachable on relaxed day trips, over land or by sea.
Further Afield 
What an inspiring area to find ourselves in. As a place to come and explore and be creative, we are ideally located at somewhat of a crossroads between East and West. There are ferry links twice weekly over to Bari in Italy, the route through Montenegro from Croatia to Albania (or vice versa) is a backpacker's dream, and there are direct trains through the mountains and over spectacular viaducts on the renowned Bar to Belgrade line. This link to Serbia, and others to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia and Greece all make for an exciting place to visit.The below images are taken throughout nearby Bosnia and Croatia.         
The Work
Alas, our building needs significant love. Structurally sound as it is, we are in need of a kickstart to enable us to quickly gut the interior, strengthen the exterior and replace the first floor. We will refit the interior ourselves - indeed the Quilliam brothers have faced such a challenge before - the entire renovation of a heritage-listed building that now houses their grand teahouse in Newcastle, UK. 
Whilst we can tile, install bathrooms, kitchens, windows, internal walls and such matters ourselves, we need to retro-fit with earthquake-proof reinforcement, and install a new first floor - all requiring professional engineering and architectural expertise. We are working with local architects and tradesmen, restoring the building to its original splendour with traditional wooden beams and stone work. Their knowledge and expertise is invaluable in this project.
Needless to say, any work we can do ourselves - any measure we can take to save funds by using our own sweat and blood - we will! This £20,000 is the total we need to complete the structural engineering work straight away. Once this work is complete, everything will be done by our hands, and by those kind enough to drop in and assist.

Check out our perks on the right side of the page for more details!My name is Amber Fawcett, from London, Ontario, Canada. Ferris and Char Char Comestics is my brainchild. The inspiration for my venture came from my two little fur babies, Ferris B and Charlotte. Ferris, a Brussels Griffon, is a little gentleman with a heart of gold, equipped with a beard most men would envy! Charlotte was my eight year old, tiny white Pomeranian princess who I lost far too soon to a heart abnormality in 2014. To pay tribute to these two loves of my life, I made them the namesakes of my company. 
I have combined my love of makeup and my passion for animals into a social enterprise that really makes a difference. Our amazing product line is manufactured in Toronto, using the highest quality ingredients. Whether you wear makeup everyday or only on special occasions, Ferris and Char Char is a brand for everyone! You'll discover beautiful shades named in tribute to animals we've known and loved.

That's unacceptable. Maternal and newborn deaths are preventable.</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><b>1- Leocadie’s story</b></p><p>Our team met Leocadie in the town of Duekoue. Leocadie at the time was 5 months pregnant and was additionally caring for her first son Kouassi. Her story really touched us. Leocadie was diagnosed with anemia in pregnancy which is frequent in the African setting. Anemia in pregnancy could be dangerous for the mother and the baby. When asked if she took an anti-anemic drug, Leocadie told our team that her husband didn’t have the money to buy the drug. Her husband had promised to sell herbs to shepherds in order to gather enough money for the drug. Until then she has to wait despite the risks for her and her baby. If she doesn't get the money, Leocadie could be the next victim of pregnancy. Leocadie could have bought the drug herself,<b> </b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">if she had an income-generating activity. </span></p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></b></p><p>Keep Mothers Alive (KMA) will start a microloans project for women like Leocadie in order to empower them.</p><p><b>2-</b>  <b>Maternal mortality issue</b></p>
<p>The majority of women in
developed countries view pregnancy and childbirth as the most amazing
experiences of their life. Unfortunately, for women living in less developed
parts of the world, becoming pregnant and giving birth to a newborn baby means
putting their lives at risk. This sad reality is expressed in an African
proverb which reads, “Every woman who gives birth has one foot in her grave.”</p>
<p>According to the World Health
Organization, in 2013, approximately 800 women per day died due to
complications during pregnancy and childbirth combined. Of the 800 daily
maternal deaths, 500 occurred in Sub-Saharan Africa and 190 in South Asia,
compared to only six deaths in developed countries. Most of these deaths were
preventable.  According to the World
Health Organization, maternal death is defined as ""the death of a woman
while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of
the duration and the site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or
aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or
incidental causes.”.  </p>
<p><b><i>The risk of a woman in a
developing country dying from a maternity-related cause during her lifetime is
about 23 times higher compared to a woman living in a developed country.
Maternal mortality is a health indicator that shows very wide gaps between rich
and poor countries.</i></b></p>
<p><b>3-  About the
organization</b></p>
<p>Keep Mothers Alive is a
Virginia-based nonprofit organization created by a Harvard School of Public
Health alumnus who holds a strong belief that regardless of where a mother
lives, giving birth should be a moment of joy and not a moment of tragedy and
despair. Keep Mothers Alive is dedicated to the improvement of women’s health
in developing countries. It is a credible and results-driven organization that
intends to help decrease maternal mortality.</p>
<p><b>My personal story</b></p>
<p>My name is Diagaunet Franck
Dodie, I am the founder of Keep Mothers Alive. I was born and raised in Africa.
I am a medical doctor from Ivory Coast who immigrated to the US in 2012, and
the following year I attended the Harvard School of Public Health. I came to
this country to live my American dream, but I am not seeking the traditional
American dream: landing a well-paying job or owning a nice car. Instead, I
believe I have been given an opportunity that should be used to impact the
lives of others at a large scale. </p>
<p>Maternal death is not just a
public health issue for me, it is a personal issue. Years ago, I experienced
the tragedy of losing a relative during childbirth. In 2003, when I was in my
5th year of medical school on the Ivory Coast, a close cousin named Madeleine
died from eclampsia while giving birth to twins. The newborns also did not
survive. It was a painful experience for me and my family. It was this personal
experience that set the groundwork for Keep Mothers Alive. I decided to
mobilize others who felt just as passionately about the importance of maternal
health as I did to join together and tackle maternal mortality in Africa.</p>
<p><b>4-  Target community
Background</b></p>
<p>Duekoue is a small town of about
72,000 people in the western part of the Ivory Coast in West Africa. In 2011
during the Ivorian Civil War, the city suffered the largest massacre in the
country’s history. More than 1,000 people were killed in a single day and much
of the town’s infrastructure was destroyed. Women and children paid the
heaviest price in this war. Four years later, while the community is still
healing from the tragedy, the consequences of the civil war persist. Maternal mortality
is one of the highest in the country. The community has endured hardship, the
women have become even more vulnerable and something needs to be done
immediately. Our project aims to help alleviate the suffering of the women in
this community.</p>
<p><b>5-  Current Situation at
the maternity ward</b></p>
<p><b>5-1  Infrastructure </b></p>
<p>The maternity ward is cramped.
There is only one delivery room with four beds. Deliveries take place in poor
conditions. The average temperature in the region is 86 degrees Fahrenheit and
there is no air-conditioning. </p>
<p>The office of the midwife is not
suitable for antenatal visits and family planning. There is only one
examination bed.</p>
<p>There is no room dedicated to
obstetric emergencies.</p>
<p>There are no special rooms for
the immediate postpartum. Women are released immediately after birth leading to
an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage. 
</p>
<p>Beds, mattresses and blankets are
obsolete. </p>
<p>There is one operating room and

<p>KMA plans to implement a
comprehensive approach to tackle each of the aforementioned causes of maternal
mortality by:</p>
<p><b>a-  Increasing antenatal
care and skilled birth attendance.</b></p>
<p>Our organization intends to raise

<p><b>b-  Providing

<p>The use of life-saving supplies
like oxytocin at birth can prevent postpartum hemorrhage, a leading cause of
maternal mortality. KMA is poised to provide the equipment and supplies needed
for a better care. </p>
<p><b>c-  Providing training
for health care workers</b></p>
<p>We will provide continuous
medical education and training for mid-wives. We believe that providing the

mortality. </p>
<p><b>d-  Women Empowerment (Community

<p>We believe that the viability of
our project will depend on its acceptance by the community. We will contribute

<p><b>-  40%</b> of the budget
will be used to provide medical equipment and drugs to enhance the quality of care. </p>
<p><b>-  23%</b> of the

<p><b>7-  The Impact</b></p>
<p>We believe that our project will
impact not only women, but the entire community of Duekoue and the surrounding
villages. In African societies, mothers are a central pillar of the family and
the entire community. Therefore the project will impact more than 100 000
people. In one year, the community health workers will have done 36,500 home
visits in the target community which will have a substantial impact in terms of
prevention of maternal and infant mortality.</p>

That's unacceptable. Maternal and newborn deaths are preventable.1- Leocadie’s storyOur team met Leocadie in the town of Duekoue. Leocadie at the time was 5 months pregnant and was additionally caring for her first son Kouassi. Her story really touched us. Leocadie was diagnosed with anemia in pregnancy which is frequent in the African setting. Anemia in pregnancy could be dangerous for the mother and the baby. When asked if she took an anti-anemic drug, Leocadie told our team that her husband didn’t have the money to buy the drug. Her husband had promised to sell herbs to shepherds in order to gather enough money for the drug. Until then she has to wait despite the risks for her and her baby. If she doesn't get the money, Leocadie could be the next victim of pregnancy. Leocadie could have bought the drug herself, if she had an income-generating activity. Keep Mothers Alive (KMA) will start a microloans project for women like Leocadie in order to empower them.2-  Maternal mortality issue
The majority of women in
developed countries view pregnancy and childbirth as the most amazing
experiences of their life. Unfortunately, for women living in less developed
parts of the world, becoming pregnant and giving birth to a newborn baby means
putting their lives at risk. This sad reality is expressed in an African
proverb which reads, “Every woman who gives birth has one foot in her grave.”
According to the World Health
Organization, in 2013, approximately 800 women per day died due to
complications during pregnancy and childbirth combined. Of the 800 daily
maternal deaths, 500 occurred in Sub-Saharan Africa and 190 in South Asia,
compared to only six deaths in developed countries. Most of these deaths were
preventable.  According to the World
Health Organization, maternal death is defined as ""the death of a woman
while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of
the duration and the site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or
aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or
incidental causes.”.  
The risk of a woman in a
developing country dying from a maternity-related cause during her lifetime is
about 23 times higher compared to a woman living in a developed country.
Maternal mortality is a health indicator that shows very wide gaps between rich
and poor countries.
3-  About the
organization
Keep Mothers Alive is a
Virginia-based nonprofit organization created by a Harvard School of Public
Health alumnus who holds a strong belief that regardless of where a mother
lives, giving birth should be a moment of joy and not a moment of tragedy and
despair. Keep Mothers Alive is dedicated to the improvement of women’s health
in developing countries. It is a credible and results-driven organization that
intends to help decrease maternal mortality.
My personal story
My name is Diagaunet Franck
Dodie, I am the founder of Keep Mothers Alive. I was born and raised in Africa.
I am a medical doctor from Ivory Coast who immigrated to the US in 2012, and
the following year I attended the Harvard School of Public Health. I came to
this country to live my American dream, but I am not seeking the traditional
American dream: landing a well-paying job or owning a nice car. Instead, I
believe I have been given an opportunity that should be used to impact the
lives of others at a large scale. 
Maternal death is not just a
public health issue for me, it is a personal issue. Years ago, I experienced
the tragedy of losing a relative during childbirth. In 2003, when I was in my
5th year of medical school on the Ivory Coast, a close cousin named Madeleine
died from eclampsia while giving birth to twins. The newborns also did not
survive. It was a painful experience for me and my family. It was this personal
experience that set the groundwork for Keep Mothers Alive. I decided to
mobilize others who felt just as passionately about the importance of maternal
health as I did to join together and tackle maternal mortality in Africa.
4-  Target community
Background
Duekoue is a small town of about
72,000 people in the western part of the Ivory Coast in West Africa. In 2011
during the Ivorian Civil War, the city suffered the largest massacre in the
country’s history. More than 1,000 people were killed in a single day and much
of the town’s infrastructure was destroyed. Women and children paid the
heaviest price in this war. Four years later, while the community is still
healing from the tragedy, the consequences of the civil war persist. Maternal mortality
is one of the highest in the country. The community has endured hardship, the
women have become even more vulnerable and something needs to be done
immediately. Our project aims to help alleviate the suffering of the women in
this community.
5-  Current Situation at
the maternity ward
5-1  Infrastructure 
The maternity ward is cramped.
There is only one delivery room with four beds. Deliveries take place in poor
conditions. The average temperature in the region is 86 degrees Fahrenheit and
there is no air-conditioning. 
The office of the midwife is not
suitable for antenatal visits and family planning. There is only one
examination bed.
There is no room dedicated to
obstetric emergencies.
There are no special rooms for
the immediate postpartum. Women are released immediately after birth leading to
an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage. 

Beds, mattresses and blankets are
obsolete. 
There is one operating room and
one recovery room with a single bed that is shared with general surgery.
5-2  Medical Equipment 
There is no gynecological exam
lamp. There are also not enough delivery kits, stethoscopes, blood pressure
cuffs, or glucose meters. The maternity ward of Duekoue has no ultrasound and
no Radiology center available. 
5-3  Causes of maternal
mortality 
There have already been 10
maternal deaths and 38 child deaths reported from January to June 2015 in the
small town of Duekoue. These deaths are a result of postpartum hemorrhage,

I have the contact number for her doctor as well.I've reached out to various Indian governmental officials (namely Sushma Swaraj) over social media in order to get their help.The hurdle was that many people do not work on Fridays in Saudi Arabia but I should be able to get in touch with someone who can speak to her soon.Basically, I'm going to get two things.1.) Her contact info and bank information so the funds can be directly deposited to HER and HER alone.2.) I will get some form of acknowledgement by the embassy or indian social forums to vouch for the authenticity of the campaign. Admittedly, this campaign is in early stages and is obviously unverified, much to my chagrin at this point. I'm hoping to change that asap, but for the time being what I ask is you bookmark this page and check back shortly when I do indeed have the means to prove what we're doing is real and genuine.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Nowadays we want more from our stores than simple buying the things that we need. While thinking how we can make shoppers a part of the store we found the great franchise formula <i>jouw marktkraam </i>with already more then 25 succesfull stores in the Netherlands. Just the concept we were looking for. It is so great that we want te be a part of this amazing franchise family. </p>
<p>This great formula is mentioned in many (local) news papers and on different TV stations. A concept which originally started in Finland more than 20 years ago and has been accepted by the people and  has become a part of the shopping street. This shopping concept called itsepalvelukirpputori literally translated self service markt. This concept gives you the opportunity to sell your things without having to be present.</p>
<p><b>Our shop is also your shop!! </b></p>
<p>""Jouw Marktkraam"" allows anyone to sell their crafts, second hand goods and new products by hiring a stand. Painting artist can rent a nail to show their work and get new commissions. A Hairdresser or make-up artist? No problem, you can rent a chair to provide for your customers without having your own salon! A Start-up of a new product and or a pre-sale? We have the possibility to display your new products and show them to customers from around the world with the help of the shops great location in the beautiful tourist city of Haarlem in the Netherlands.

<b>How does it work?</b>
</div><div>It is simple! We have different possibilities to rent your own little spot in our store. We have large and small stands, nails, book shelves, window spots, chairs, promotion space and garden space. You always rent for at least 1 week (the chairs and promotion space are rented per hour). You place your stuff in the stand and if you like you can decorate it. (we are there to help you) We have price tags with a unique barcode which belongs to your account. We also have security tags and more stuff to bring your little shop to life. Then you take a nice cup of coffee or tea and a slice of home made apple pie in the courtyard and we will do the rest! The full proceeds of the sale is for you. You can check during the day how your sales are going on the realtime app. You therefore know when there are empty spots on your stand so you are able to drop in and fill this with other products. At the end of your rental period we transfer the income to your bank account. You can pick up the rest of your products or donate them to the special stand where we raise money for different charities. (local and international.)</div><div>

Not only the locals will love our store but also national and international tourists will find there way to the shop. The shop will be full with all kinds of different products which you can't find in the other shops. There will be products for everyone!! Buyers will come to shop for a present, a souvenier, cheap designer clothes, decorations for home and garden, toys for children, smart products (smartwatch, finders etc) , art and match more! Local buyers will know that every week there are new sellers so new reasons to visit the store and tourists will find unique presents and souvenirs to take home.



Why crowd funding
Yes we can take a loan from the bank but we like to give something back!! With crowd funding we can do that. We have different perks for everyone all around the world and you will all be a part of our store, how great is that! See the different perks and choose the one you like




What We Need & What You Get
This is how we""ll spend the money:


€4000 Special Cash register ( for scanning unique barcodes referending to our sellers, accounting program, and communicate with the app)
 €8000 for wood and material to make the stands
€1000 for paint, nails, sales counter, clothes hangers, presentation torsos and security tags

€3000 Franchise fee (one-off)

€6000 Rent, insurance, gas, electricity, water and deposit 

€3000 Printer to print unique barcode labels, barber chair and advertisement
 
If we raise more, and I hope we do, we will spend it on a nice wooden floor. If we raise less we will loan this part.
What we will give back:
We have a perk for everyone, choose the perk you like and you will not be disappointed!
We have two options to chose from.
Option 1: If you choose to display your products in the store, we will discuss a date. You receive unique barcode labels for pricing and some security tags.
Option 2: If you choose to make a donation and like to receive a goodiebag, we will send you (worldwide) a well-stocked goodiebag with Dutch products and more!! Money well spent!
For those who donate €500 and more, you can send your product to us, we will price them for you, we will sell the product for you and more! All details will be discussed. For businesses a great opportunity to increases sales opportunities in the Netherlands. But if you would like a goodiebag, that is also ok:-)

    Risks & Challenges
We can’t predict the future, but here’s what we do know: 

There are more then 25 stores allready and they are doing good business. The people love the concept and the opportunity to make some extra money. Small and big companies (around the world) can extend there sale locations. We don't have our own stock, so the only risk we have, is that we have a month that we don't rent out enough stands, but we will save money from the profit in order to cope with this.    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:
tell others about us, visit us and buy some gifts for your friends. And rent a stand, if you are able to now, or in the future. We would love to get to know you!! And follow us on facebook no matter were you life, join us!",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Vision</h3> <p><a href=""http://www.therevolveproject.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Revolve Project</a> team has been dedicated to making an impact in the City of 
San Bernardino since we first began as CalState University SB students, looking for our own way to develop as professionals and execute our skill sets. For the last few years, our team has continuously been on the hunt for 'quality' forms of basic office and work space for solid productivity. A place to work and network and be a part of community and also a space that supports small business development. After years and countless hours of struggling through the hassles and uncomfortableness of dealing with the one crowded noisey coffee shop after another, we decided to set out and create an INCREDIBLY AFFORDABLE Coworking Hub of our own -and bring back an all new entrepreneurial and creative life force to the heart of San Bernardino!<br/><br/>Alas, our journey has secured a fantastic location inside the historic downtown Andreson Building, which is directly across the street from SB City Hall. It has an <a href=""http://www.omnitrans.org/services/sbx/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SBX</a> express bus line stop right in front, is just two blocks down from the <a href=""http://www.californiatheatre.net/Home.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">California Theatre</a> and <a href=""http://www.regmovies.com/theatres/theatre-folder/regal-san-bernardino-stadium-14-rpx-9328"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Regal Cinemas</a>-- and our favorite part; Right next to the downtown <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_San_Bernardino"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Court Street Square</a> Events Space! Downtown San Bernardino is the perfect location for The Headquarters and our vision, which is to create a dynamic think tank and creative work space that will allow people to come together to work and build a thriving community of professional Do-ers, Start-Ups and Entrepreneurial Creatives. <br/></p>
<p>In the past, our teams and associated organizations have used the Court Street Square for the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Downtown-Summer-Fest-SB-1511341722432423/?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Downtown-Summer-Fest-SB-1511341722432423/?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Downtown Summer Festival</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.541368189337717.1073741836.510295059111697&amp;type=3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>Turn Up The Vote rally Event</a>, Food Truck Market Nights, Chamber Of Commerce Community Events and more. So we plan to continue reviving a downtown buzz for our city with more community events that will cultivate and grow culture. In addition to that, The Headquarters will provide resources to other small business minded professionals looking to develop and launch their ventures. Our Coworking space will provide small businesses &amp; start-ups with the various resources to get going right where we need them...  in the heart of downtown SB!</p> <ul>
<li>Downtown San Bernardino needs support and growth of existing small businesses.<br/><br/>
</li> <li>The HQ will provide space for those needing a launch pad to get started creating jobs, income and eventually economic impact that our city needs to grow and revive. <br/><br/>
</li>
<li>The HQ will be a catalyst for new business creation, non-profit facilitation, business community involvement, and small business education &amp; resources.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>The membership pricing structure will allow anyone to afford workspace at a fraction of the cost of what it would be to rent out a private office lease. <br/><br/><br/>
</li> </ul> <p>San Bernardino has held the title of an ""All-America City"".  The Headquarters is going to be a major force that will help the future growth of that title. <br/><br/></p>

<br/><h1><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><h3>Economic Impact</h3> </span></h1>
<p>From Survey data, we found that local entrepreneurs and independent contractors are stuck meeting at Starbucks, Denny's, IHOP, McDonald's or other chain restaurants because of the free wifi and a space that allows for them to do business or meet clients. However most people are unsatisfied by the limitations of these such spaces- as they are chain business establishments and are not evolved to house dynamic community interaction and workflow. <br/></p>
<p>This means that up till now San Bernardino has NOT provided an economic hub for Entrepreneurial thinkers and this is stifling the growth potential.     <br/></p> <ul> <li>We need the entrepreneurs and proactive do-ers of our city creating work, projects and opportunities for themselves and their peers. <br/><br/>
</li> <li>San Bernardino needs affordable shared workspace to support displaced entrepreneurs who need a basic ""Headquarters"" for their business ventures.<br/>The HQ will provide that!<span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>
</h3>

<p><br/>Not only do we plan to help launch small businesses, but we plan to provide:<br/>• Resources<br/>• Workshops<br/>• Attract Chamber Of Commerce meetings<br/>• Showcase expert guest speakers<br/>• Host networking mixers <br/>• Provide innovative financial backing of small businesses//startups<br/>• Facilitate community projects.<br/><br/><br/>* And most significantly, The HQ team is developing an all new unique Non-profit program for Youth Entrepreneurial Development to be housed at the hub as well!!<br/><br/></p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p> <ul> <li>Small businesses have a ruff 1/5 survival rate. If we support small businesses and start-ups to develop and launch together in San Bernardino at the same time, with knowledge of a community support network, then we can act to keep these businesses alive. While The HQ will strive to act as the support base for these new businesses, we will need support too!<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>We want to maximize the resources we can provide startups and currently we have secured 2,200 square feet of actual floor space at low rates; but in the near future rental rates may change (especially for extended hours of operation). This is why we need your support NOW so that we can get the long term resources and members established which will allow for long term sustainability.<span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span>

to San Bernardino! 








The Vision The Revolve Project team has been dedicated to making an impact in the City of 
San Bernardino since we first began as CalState University SB students, looking for our own way to develop as professionals and execute our skill sets. For the last few years, our team has continuously been on the hunt for 'quality' forms of basic office and work space for solid productivity. A place to work and network and be a part of community and also a space that supports small business development. After years and countless hours of struggling through the hassles and uncomfortableness of dealing with the one crowded noisey coffee shop after another, we decided to set out and create an INCREDIBLY AFFORDABLE Coworking Hub of our own -and bring back an all new entrepreneurial and creative life force to the heart of San Bernardino!Alas, our journey has secured a fantastic location inside the historic downtown Andreson Building, which is directly across the street from SB City Hall. It has an SBX express bus line stop right in front, is just two blocks down from the California Theatre and Regal Cinemas-- and our favorite part; Right next to the downtown Court Street Square Events Space! Downtown San Bernardino is the perfect location for The Headquarters and our vision, which is to create a dynamic think tank and creative work space that will allow people to come together to work and build a thriving community of professional Do-ers, Start-Ups and Entrepreneurial Creatives. 
In the past, our teams and associated organizations have used the Court Street Square for the Downtown Summer Festival, Turn Up The Vote rally Event, Food Truck Market Nights, Chamber Of Commerce Community Events and more. So we plan to continue reviving a downtown buzz for our city with more community events that will cultivate and grow culture. In addition to that, The Headquarters will provide resources to other small business minded professionals looking to develop and launch their ventures. Our Coworking space will provide small businesses & start-ups with the various resources to get going right where we need them...  in the heart of downtown SB! 
Downtown San Bernardino needs support and growth of existing small businesses.
 The HQ will provide space for those needing a launch pad to get started creating jobs, income and eventually economic impact that our city needs to grow and revive. 

The HQ will be a catalyst for new business creation, non-profit facilitation, business community involvement, and small business education & resources.

The membership pricing structure will allow anyone to afford workspace at a fraction of the cost of what it would be to rent out a private office lease. 
  San Bernardino has held the title of an ""All-America City"".  The Headquarters is going to be a major force that will help the future growth of that title. 


Why We Are Fundraising
We need to do some remodeling and re-furnishing ;)Interior Designs have been researched, created and cost-effectively chosen, now we just need to raise the money to help outfit The HQ with the appropriate furniture and amenities that will make this space truly be a comfortable yet stylish think tank. 

   



3 Ways To Fund Support & Our Offerings

A ""Down For The Cause"" Donation.--Offering special shout out's on our website.

A Membership Sign-up:--Offering our initial membership sign up rates through this campaign.

A Major Sponsorship Donation:--Offering a range of quality sponsorship packages to be a stake holder//Partner in The HQ.***Offering The Headquarters 'swag' for various donation levels












Economic Impact 
From Survey data, we found that local entrepreneurs and independent contractors are stuck meeting at Starbucks, Denny's, IHOP, McDonald's or other chain restaurants because of the free wifi and a space that allows for them to do business or meet clients. However most people are unsatisfied by the limitations of these such spaces- as they are chain business establishments and are not evolved to house dynamic community interaction and workflow. 
This means that up till now San Bernardino has NOT provided an economic hub for Entrepreneurial thinkers and this is stifling the growth potential.       We need the entrepreneurs and proactive do-ers of our city creating work, projects and opportunities for themselves and their peers. 
 San Bernardino needs affordable shared workspace to support displaced entrepreneurs who need a basic ""Headquarters"" for their business ventures.The HQ will provide that!
    


Not only do we plan to help launch small businesses, but we plan to provide:• Resources• Workshops• Attract Chamber Of Commerce meetings• Showcase expert guest speakers• Host networking mixers • Provide innovative financial backing of small businesses//startups• Facilitate community projects.* And most significantly, The HQ team is developing an all new unique Non-profit program for Youth Entrepreneurial Development to be housed at the hub as well!!

Some Of Our Supporters


Risks & Challenges    Small businesses have a ruff 1/5 survival rate. If we support small businesses and start-ups to develop and launch together in San Bernardino at the same time, with knowledge of a community support network, then we can act to keep these businesses alive. While The HQ will strive to act as the support base for these new businesses, we will need support too!

We want to maximize the resources we can provide startups and currently we have secured 2,200 square feet of actual floor space at low rates; but in the near future rental rates may change (especially for extended hours of operation). This is why we need your support NOW so that we can get the long term resources and members established which will allow for long term sustainability. 




Other Ways You Can Help We need to create a BUZZ for this project, so spreading the word will be HUGE!   Ask folks to get the word out. Tell them how San Bernardino's Downtown is going to have a NEW Entrepreneurship hub called The Headquarters!

However, these adaptions didn’t hit the core of the original business model of the Hub: To provide shared space and networking services for the members while recovering costs.</p><p>At the beginning of this year, we initiated a transition phase towards a new model to achieve sustainability of the project. By early March 2015 a rough model was in place and a strategic plan was defined. Over the subsequent months, Impact Hub Oaxaca has engaged in a continuous re-design process working intensely with its  newly committed staff team, along with other allies and stakeholders. Now, as the culmination of this process, it is time to launch the Incubation and Accelerator Model for Artisans and Social Entrepreneurs which the staff have designed.</p><p>Funding for investment in infrastructure and promotion of the new model will be needed for the next 4 to 6 next months.</p><p><b>WHAT IS IMPACT HUB OAXACA?</b></p><p>Our HUB Oaxaca is an organization, a location, and a community of more than 50 members and organizations who seek to improve the well-being, collaboration, and sustainability of both traditional and emerging communities in Oaxaca, Mexico.  </p><p><b>WE BELIEVE IN...</b></p><p>a world where creativity is nurtured and channeled towards a common good.  As an entrepreneurial incubator and accelerator, with deep roots in local communities, Impact Hub provides a diverse range of programming through workshops, classes, and cultural events. We link up organizations, teams and individuals with local and international resources, leading to diverse and positive transformative goals.</p><p><b>OUR MISSION</b></p><p>is to be a platform for collaboration and a catalyst for local initiatives which are dedicated to improving the well-being of Oaxaca. We are now providing connections, tools, knowledge and support in a shared space. We are implementing initiatives to create a sustainable Oaxaca. Hub Oaxaca is a home for interaction and exchange between traditional and emerging communities in Oaxaca.  </p><p><b>WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW AT IMPACT HUB OAXACA?</b></p><p>One of the key activities HUB Oaxaca has worked on in the last moths is to ​develop, test and implement alternative ways of providing services, to a wider segment of social entrepreneurs.</p><p><b>It has become clear that one of the biggest potential user segments among existing entrepreneurs is artisanal producers of handicrafts. </b>For Oaxaca this group includes: weavers, wood carvers, ceramicists, mezcal producers, basket makers and others. All of them share a rich experience and mastery of their processes, but they lack the business knowledge and skills that could take them out of “survival mode”.</p><p>In the last 5 months we’ve been working to prototype a group of services and support we can provide to this special sector in Oaxaca. We have also created new membership models and their related benefits that make it easier for members to access services. Several new workshops and training sessions have been offered  some of which are now linked together to provide more coherent sequential programs, which we seek to implement this autumn.</p><p><b>It's time to launch this ambitious plan!</b></p><p>​​<b>If we can raise at least $11,000 through Indiegogo, we could strengthen the operating structure of the Hub, enough to implement this exciting program: we will support our local artisans with incubation and acceleration programs to provide them with the tools for business planning, financial management, innovative design, competitive marketing and producer empowerment, among others.</b></p><p>Spread the word! Our doors have been open in the historical heart of Oaxaca for 5 years. Our membership continues to grow because we are filling a need in our community.  But, now, we need a extra support, to be able to help our local artisans.</p><p><b>Your donation will make the difference!</b></p><p><b>Rewards</b>!</p><p>We have amazing rewards for our collaborators; check it out at the right!

definimos un nuevo plan estratégico. En los meses posteriores, el Impact Hub
Oaxaca ha visto un proceso de rediseño continuo, con el trabajo de nuestro comprometido
equipo  , así como de la mano de aliados
y actores afines. Ahora, para la culminación de este proceso necesitamos iniciar los procesos de incubación y el nuevo modelo de aceleradora de

However, these adaptions didn’t hit the core of the original business model of the Hub: To provide shared space and networking services for the members while recovering costs.At the beginning of this year, we initiated a transition phase towards a new model to achieve sustainability of the project. By early March 2015 a rough model was in place and a strategic plan was defined. Over the subsequent months, Impact Hub Oaxaca has engaged in a continuous re-design process working intensely with its  newly committed staff team, along with other allies and stakeholders. Now, as the culmination of this process, it is time to launch the Incubation and Accelerator Model for Artisans and Social Entrepreneurs which the staff have designed.Funding for investment in infrastructure and promotion of the new model will be needed for the next 4 to 6 next months.WHAT IS IMPACT HUB OAXACA?Our HUB Oaxaca is an organization, a location, and a community of more than 50 members and organizations who seek to improve the well-being, collaboration, and sustainability of both traditional and emerging communities in Oaxaca, Mexico.  WE BELIEVE IN...a world where creativity is nurtured and channeled towards a common good.  As an entrepreneurial incubator and accelerator, with deep roots in local communities, Impact Hub provides a diverse range of programming through workshops, classes, and cultural events. We link up organizations, teams and individuals with local and international resources, leading to diverse and positive transformative goals.OUR MISSIONis to be a platform for collaboration and a catalyst for local initiatives which are dedicated to improving the well-being of Oaxaca. We are now providing connections, tools, knowledge and support in a shared space. We are implementing initiatives to create a sustainable Oaxaca. Hub Oaxaca is a home for interaction and exchange between traditional and emerging communities in Oaxaca.  WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW AT IMPACT HUB OAXACA?One of the key activities HUB Oaxaca has worked on in the last moths is to ​develop, test and implement alternative ways of providing services, to a wider segment of social entrepreneurs.It has become clear that one of the biggest potential user segments among existing entrepreneurs is artisanal producers of handicrafts. For Oaxaca this group includes: weavers, wood carvers, ceramicists, mezcal producers, basket makers and others. All of them share a rich experience and mastery of their processes, but they lack the business knowledge and skills that could take them out of “survival mode”.In the last 5 months we’ve been working to prototype a group of services and support we can provide to this special sector in Oaxaca. We have also created new membership models and their related benefits that make it easier for members to access services. Several new workshops and training sessions have been offered  some of which are now linked together to provide more coherent sequential programs, which we seek to implement this autumn.It's time to launch this ambitious plan!​​If we can raise at least $11,000 through Indiegogo, we could strengthen the operating structure of the Hub, enough to implement this exciting program: we will support our local artisans with incubation and acceleration programs to provide them with the tools for business planning, financial management, innovative design, competitive marketing and producer empowerment, among others.Spread the word! Our doors have been open in the historical heart of Oaxaca for 5 years. Our membership continues to grow because we are filling a need in our community.  But, now, we need a extra support, to be able to help our local artisans.Your donation will make the difference!Rewards!We have amazing rewards for our collaborators; check it out at the right! As a thank you for your donation you can receive coworking memberships, free workshops passes, free rent of our meeting rooms and palapa for your events, beautiful products created by our members and much more.

artesanos y emprendedores sociales
Impact Hub Oaxaca es un espacio de coworking y es sede de diferentes eventos, pero sobre todo es un laboratorio de innovación
para personas y organizaciones que trabajan a favor de la transformación
social. Impact Hub Oaxaca es posible gracias a un equipo talentoso y vibrante
con diversos perfiles y orígenes.
En los últimos años, el Impact Hub Oaxaca ha
intentado adaptarse a los constantes cambios del ecosistema de emprendimiento
social local Oaxaqueño. Sin embargo, este proceso de adaptación no logro del todo
impactar las bases de nuestro modelo de negocio original, que consistía en proporcionar un espacio
de coworking así como servicios para los miembros de la red.
A principios de este año iniciamos una fase de
transición hacia un nuevo modelo para lograr la sostenibilidad financiera del
proyecto. En marzo de 2015 comenzamos con la implementación de un nuevo modelo y
definimos un nuevo plan estratégico. En los meses posteriores, el Impact Hub
Oaxaca ha visto un proceso de rediseño continuo, con el trabajo de nuestro comprometido
equipo  , así como de la mano de aliados
y actores afines. Ahora, para la culminación de este proceso necesitamos iniciar los procesos de incubación y el nuevo modelo de aceleradora de
negocios, diseñados específicamente para artesanos y emprendedores sociales.
Para este nuevo modelo, necesitamos fondos que serán
invertidos en infraestructura y promoción en los próximos 4 a 6 meses. 
¿QUÉ ES EL IMPACT HUB OAXACA?
El HUB Oaxaca es una organización, un lugar y
una comunidad de más de 50 miembros y organizaciones que buscan mejorar el
bienestar, la colaboración y la sostenibilidad de las comunidades tradicionales
y emergentes en Oaxaca, México.
CREEMOS QUE 
...Un mundo donde la creatividad es alimentada y
canalizada hacia un bien común es posible. Como una incubadora para emprendedores
y aceleradora de negocios con profundas raíces en las comunidades locales, Impact
Hub Oaxaca proporciona una amplia gama de opciones a través de talleres, clases
y eventos culturales. Vinculamos a organizaciones, equipos e individuos con
recursos locales e internacionales, llevando a cabo acciones con transformadoras
y de impacto social. 
NUESTRA MISIÓN

¿LO QUE ESTÁ SUCEDIENDO AHORA EN EL IMPACT HUB OAXACA?
Una de las actividades clave que Hub Oaxaca ha
trabajado en los últimos meses es desarrollar, probar e implementar formas
alternativas de prestación de servicios, a un segmento más amplio de los emprendedores
sociales.
Estamos apuntando como usuarios potenciales a los
empresarios artesanales productores de artesanías. En Oaxaca este grupo
incluye: tejedores, talladores de madera, ceramistas, productores de mezcal y
cesteros, etc. Todos ellos comparten una gran experiencia y dominio de sus
procesos, pero les falta el conocimiento del negocio y habilidades que podrían
sacarlos de un ""modo de supervivencia"".
En los últimos 5 meses hemos estado trabajando
para crear un grupo de servicios y apoyos que podemos proporcionar a este
sector en Oaxaca. También hemos creado nuevos modelos de membresía con beneficios
que facilitan a los usuarios a acceder a los servicios. Ofrecemos varios
talleres y sesiones de entrenamiento, ligados de manera estratégica para
proporcionar programas secuenciales más coherentes, que intentamos poner en
práctica este otoño.
Es el momento de iniciar este ambicioso plan.
Si podemos recaudar al menos $11.000 USD a
través de  Indiegogo, podríamos
fortalecer nuestra estructura operativa, lo suficiente para poner en práctica
este emocionante programa: vamos a apoyar a nuestros artesanos locales con
programas de incubación y aceleración para brindarles las herramientas para la

<p>This real-time video loop shows the valve in the final seconds where it forms a kink and closes off the irrigation flow. The whole sequence from dry to wet has taken approximately 40 minutes.

<p>Winning the awards was a real boost and confirmed
that many other people could identify with and share our vision.  </p>
<p>But for people to benefit from our new technology we had to figure out a way
to make them in big numbers and with the right materials.  And design new connectors and hoses so that we could make complete irrigation kits to water plants. Our development journey is now almost complete
and we are ready to go!</p>

<p>Where
families are clustered together we have an ambition to supply a new type of float
valve (an un-blockable one) which could be fitted to each irrigation water tank,
enabling a number of tanks to be linked together with hoses to refill
automatically from a water source.  This
would do away with manual filling with buckets. 
This simple step could transform many lives for the better.  We have a prototype ‘un-blockable’ float
valve ready for production and are presenting it here for your consideration as
our stretch target goal. </p>
<p>Raising
an additional $50,000 would enable us to introduce this unique ‘<b>Pinch
Float Valve’</b>. Our prototype operates with any kind of feed water - without
blocking.  This is because of two things
namely, (1) it has an open 1/2"" through-bore and (2) it can only ever be
fully open or fully closed – no jams or dribbling. These valves will enable up
to 20 families to refill their irrigation water tanks automatically (giving
them more time for other things) through a layout of hoses from a single water
source, for example a borehole and, most importantly, a simple ‘displacement’ type water pump.</p>
<div>
<b>This additional invention has the potential to benefit at least 100,000 small communities in remote dry regions of Africa.</b>

<div>Apart from the obvious benefits of groups of families cultivating plots of land together and sharing the cost of a borehole and pump. The increase in <b>organised leaf canopy</b> on hitherto barren soils will be very attractive to Carbon Off-set companies seeking new projects.<b> The world's soils store on the order of 2,500 gigatons of carbon, which is three times the amount in the atmosphere. <b>Low Carbon soils especially, have the capacity to sequestrate large quantities of Carbon from the atmosphere.</b></b>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We think that <b>Carbon Off-setting</b> organisations will soon be attracted to subsidize the cost of community-scale drip irrigation systems - making them even more affordable to families, benefiting remote rural communities and urban industry.

<div>It's not often that such a wide audience of people are engaged in the development of new products but we think this is the perfect time for some intervention on your part as it's not just about money - you might have some ideas of your own!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p>Right here and now we have ‘tangible’ drip irrigation kits
which on the face of it look pretty plain and ordinary, but look closer and you
will see that every component is subtly different from its contemporary.  To keep the kit prices down to an affordable level
we have to manufacture in volume and make best use of our combination of skills, where Mike, our Founder, is an accomplished engineer and Chryspin, our Director in Kenya is a great communicator and lobbyist with extensive experience gained from travelling throughout Africa. We also benefit from the services of our accountant, lawyer, patent attorney and local specialist
manufacturers all of whom advise us from time to time over ‘issues’ that arise
– mostly gained through hindsight.  We
think this is a winning combination to reduce the current risk but we will
never turn away some blue sky thinking on your part.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Setting up a whole new business is not for the feint hearted, but we have a lot of support on our side and have established good working
relationships with local manufacturers such that when we recruit our new
employees they will be trained up by our partner organisations by working in
their office and production areas under close supervision.  We want to get our work practices right from
the outset so that when we lease our new premises we will be able to hit the
ground running –as they say. </p>
<p></p>

<p><b>Quality and maintaining
morale:</b></p>
<p>When I was much younger, as an apprentice, I found myself
having to do lots of repetitive work which quickly became really, really
boring.  Conscious of the fact that there
will be a number of operations in the production process, the warehouse and in
the office which will fall into this category we will set up small teams or
cells of people, each with a team leader and rotate their jobs each month on a
competitive and fair basis.  Hopefully
this will reduce monotony, give a sense of personal achievement and broaden
each employee’s understanding of where they fit in, and fully appreciate the value of their own contribution.  The many visitors
that we plan to have on a regular basis will also help to maintain a high level
of interest and involvement.  </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b>Product development
journey:</b></p>
<p>We have spent six years developing our range of products
from scratch and over the coming months, and with your help we will complete
this process by mid-2016 and step up to the plate as a ‘volume manufacturer’.  </p>
<p>However we do ask that you afford us one caveat: Our new
<b>SMART POLYMER</b> Liquid Lever Kink Valve is acknowledged globally as a step-change
invention for the irrigation industry, and likened to the electrical industry's micro-switch. 
Once the Hose extruder line is running satisfactorily and our staff are
confident, we will use the weekend downtime to run the extruder, with some
extra gear so that it can co-extrude our special Liquid Lever polymers.  For commercial reasons this bit is still
under wraps but we promise that you will be the first to know when we have
reached the end of our development journey and of course be the first to
receive Liquid Lever Kink Valves from the line.  Our
extruder trials are now just one step away from completion and we have already
tested the co-polymers for 1,800 wet and dry cycles – equivalent to approx. six
years of use in the field.  </p>
<p>Thank you for your patience and for being a part of this
journey.</p>

<p>They work by gravity (zero energy) from a tank of water – any kind of water, turbid, etc.  In many cases the water tank can be stood on the ground. </p>
<p>Each kit comprises connectors and hoses which are joined together (push fit) and laid out on the ground in an array to provide one dripper per plant for water to drip out onto the soil.</p>
<p>We have developed two unique types of dripper, one for salad &amp; row crops and one for trees &amp; shrubs, called the SqueezeMe and the NEW Liquid Lever respectively.  The SqueezeMe Emitter is adjustable and made from two parts, uniquely it can be pinched or squeezed to flush out trapped debris. The NEW Liquid Lever Kink Valve is based on <b>SMART POLYMERS</b> which respond to local moisture or the lack of it.  In practice each tree or shrub controls its own watering. </p>
<p><b>As the plant sucks the ground dry the Liquid Lever un-kinks to allow the flow of irrigation water out onto the ground until it is re-wetted sufficiently and then it kinks closed again until the next time.</b></p>

</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>How many plants can you water?</b></p>
<p>It depends on the height of the water tank.  We make drip kits from 10 Plant to 500 Plant for water tanks from 0-1 metre elevation and have successfully trialled 1,200 Plant kits with a 2 metre tank elevation.  But a number of Kenyan Farmers now are pushing the boundaries with elevated tanks (3-5 metres) and hope to operate up to 5,000 drippers at a time.  These early customers are extremely enthusiastic and will quickly find out what the practical limit is – and let us know.  There is something of a competition going on between them.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>How long will the drip kits last?</b></p>
<p>Our connectors and hoses are made from polymers used in the automotive industry, their properties are well documented and they have life expectancies in excess of 10 years.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>What are the benefits to African Families?</b></p>
<p>We have grown crops in Kenya very successfully using our drip kits which, when we measure the outcomes we can show a 44 week payback period just from growing cabbages.  Using local shops on the outskirts of Nairobi as price guides.</p>
<p>Successful drip irrigation will extend the growing season for families so that crops can be available when external supplies are dwindling and becoming more costly.  Our drip irrigation takes this to the next level as it can be kept operating even when the quality of the feed water is deteriorating for example, due to a drop in the water table.</p>

Tens of millions of people in dry regions could grow more food if only they had access to simple and practical drip kits designed to work with any kind of water.







We know that any dripper/emitter/valve will get blocked -
so we have designed our key components to be squeezable to flush out debris e.g.
insect larvae, algae and in-organic matter (mud). With our new technology, small farmers can use water from any source for example from a lagoon, river, borehole etc. to grow more food.















We are overwhelmed by enquiries for our drip irrigation kits in Africa but we have to make them affordable for low
income families - shipping big bulky drip kits half way round the world is prohibitively
expensive and unsustainable.


‘Made
in Africa’ and with only local transportation needs to contend with we could
reduce the kit prices by 50% making them affordable to all but the poorest
families. 


With
a local factory creating new jobs for local people AND with your support we
could achieve our sustainable goal. 


Local
manufacture also means that for the poorest families we will be able to supply many,
many more drip irrigation kits through our associated charity - Grow More Food.












We have an offer of $360,000 ring-fenced for our use by the Africa Enterprise Challenge Fund (AECF) to help us to establish Liquid Lever (Kenya) Ltd, comprising a $90,000 grant and $270,000 loan, principally for Revenue Expenditure. But we need to add at least $95,000 to this for Capital Expenditure on the Hose extrusion line and ancillary equipment to make drip Hoses and then with some tweaks, co-extrude the new SMART POLYMER Liquid Lever 'moisture-responsive' kink valves.
We have a ‘full business plan’ and AECF have been very rigorous in their selection process and they will be regularly monitoring our project over the next six years.




AECF funding will take us nearly 80% of the way to our target provided we satisfy all of their conditions, otherwise their offer will be withdrawn
Because our project to help low income families to grow more food in arid African communities has no bricks and mortar assets, a bank loan is not feasible - 


This is why we are crowdfunding.



Our goal is to raise the balance of $95,000 in 40 days!

With these funds we can set up the essential Hose and Kink Valve manufacturing facility in Nairobi, Kenya and add further value to this by packing the drip kits and selling and distributing these across East Africa, through Sales Agents, independent Distributors and through our registered charity Grow More Food.










For trees & shrubs - our NEW! SMART POLYMER Kink Valves are moisture-activated - so that plants water themselves, up to 8 gallons per hour (30L)
For row & salad crops - our SqueezeMe Emitters/Drippers are adjustable - so that plants can be watered, anything up to 1/4 gallon per hour (1L)




We have developed a NEW 'SMART POLYMER' KINK VALVE to enable people to irrigate trees and shrubs on dry land with the minimum of water - no matter how dirty! Our unique Liquid Lever moisture-activated kink valve is now just one mouse click away from mass-production.















Prototype Kink Valve (1.5"" long - 38 mm) showing closing operation


 


This real-time video loop shows the valve in the final seconds where it forms a kink and closes off the irrigation flow. The whole sequence from dry to wet has taken approximately 40 minutes. So the valve is able to deliver several gallons of water to the tree or shrub before closing for a few hours or even days if the conditions around the kink valve remain wet.

Our Kink Valve has featured in:






Our local press


Plastics & Rubber Weekly


TPI News (UKTI Publication)


IChemE Water Awards


The Shell Springboard Awards.




















Winning the awards was a real boost and confirmed
that many other people could identify with and share our vision.  
But for people to benefit from our new technology we had to figure out a way
to make them in big numbers and with the right materials.  And design new connectors and hoses so that we could make complete irrigation kits to water plants. Our development journey is now almost complete
and we are ready to go!










































It is our brand name for a range of family-sized irrigation Drip Kits comprising very practical Connectors, Hoses and 'Drippers' (i.e. where the water comes out).
We have trialled these in Kenya over the past year, during which we were constantly asked by smallholders, ""When can we have them and how much?""
That year was important for us as even after six years of development work in the UK we still had things to learn.
Then with the changes in place we promoted the kits for the first time at the Nairobi International Trade Fair, Kenya - Sep/Oct 2015.
Our team in Kenya were overwhelmed with over 4,000 visitors to our dirt/cabbage Drip Irrigation patch.
We have the opportunity now to make a real difference to people's lives, our drip kits work, and people all over Africa want them.
But we have a problem. Our sub-contractor makes our TPE Hoses in the UK and they are just too bulky and too expensive to ship to Africa. We must make hoses in Africa for Africa, and then make our new SMART POLYMER Liquid Lever Kink Valves.






We can set up a manufacturing facility in Kenya, employing local people within which we will be able to install and operate a Hose extrusion line and marry these hoses up with our connectors, which we make in the UK, then sell our Drip Irrigation Kits at locally affordable prices throughout East Africa.


But there's more:
We also run a charity called Grow More Food and through this we will also donate drip kits to the most needy in dry and remote regions.




























We want our 'Technology Transfer' to Africa to be an empowering experience in every sense of the word. Extruding our hoses locally is the first step, but it all starts here with the customer:





Having designed all of our drip kit components to overcome the universal problems associated with small scale drip irrigation, we now want to create local jobs, cultivate skills and boost livelihoods all the way along the supply chain. Without being disruptive, we want to add value to the African economy and we believe that added value comes from within each and every one of us.




















Please
note:
Our
Perks from $300 to $5,000 also include drip kits of various sizes which we will
donate to families in Kenya through our charity Grow More Food.  As a follow up, each
family will send you a photograph and a letter thanking you for your donation, showing the benefits of your life-changing support. 

If
you have a special request please contact us by email ‘info@liquidlever.com’.
*Colours supplied and specifications including visual appearance may
vary in your ‘first off’ samples as our first priority will be to achieve consistent kink valve/emitter kinking performance.








Judging from other people's experience it takes up to a couple of months for packages to find their way to everyone around the world. We will try to improve on this and always let you know when a package is being shipped to you.
Our open door policy means that as a Founding Supporter you are welcome to visit us at any time – and your friends are welcome too. 












Where
families are clustered together we have an ambition to supply a new type of float
valve (an un-blockable one) which could be fitted to each irrigation water tank,
enabling a number of tanks to be linked together with hoses to refill
automatically from a water source.  This
would do away with manual filling with buckets. 
This simple step could transform many lives for the better.  We have a prototype ‘un-blockable’ float
valve ready for production and are presenting it here for your consideration as
our stretch target goal. 
Raising
an additional $50,000 would enable us to introduce this unique ‘Pinch
Float Valve’. Our prototype operates with any kind of feed water - without
blocking.  This is because of two things
namely, (1) it has an open 1/2"" through-bore and (2) it can only ever be
fully open or fully closed – no jams or dribbling. These valves will enable up
to 20 families to refill their irrigation water tanks automatically (giving
them more time for other things) through a layout of hoses from a single water
source, for example a borehole and, most importantly, a simple ‘displacement’ type water pump.

This additional invention has the potential to benefit at least 100,000 small communities in remote dry regions of Africa.










Apart from the obvious benefits of groups of families cultivating plots of land together and sharing the cost of a borehole and pump. The increase in organised leaf canopy on hitherto barren soils will be very attractive to Carbon Off-set companies seeking new projects. The world's soils store on the order of 2,500 gigatons of carbon, which is three times the amount in the atmosphere. Low Carbon soils especially, have the capacity to sequestrate large quantities of Carbon from the atmosphere.


We think that Carbon Off-setting organisations will soon be attracted to subsidize the cost of community-scale drip irrigation systems - making them even more affordable to families, benefiting remote rural communities and urban industry. Helping to both reverse climate change and counter population drift.








It's not often that such a wide audience of people are engaged in the development of new products but we think this is the perfect time for some intervention on your part as it's not just about money - you might have some ideas of your own!


Right here and now we have ‘tangible’ drip irrigation kits
which on the face of it look pretty plain and ordinary, but look closer and you
will see that every component is subtly different from its contemporary.  To keep the kit prices down to an affordable level
we have to manufacture in volume and make best use of our combination of skills, where Mike, our Founder, is an accomplished engineer and Chryspin, our Director in Kenya is a great communicator and lobbyist with extensive experience gained from travelling throughout Africa. We also benefit from the services of our accountant, lawyer, patent attorney and local specialist
manufacturers all of whom advise us from time to time over ‘issues’ that arise
– mostly gained through hindsight.  We
think this is a winning combination to reduce the current risk but we will
never turn away some blue sky thinking on your part.  

Setting up a whole new business is not for the feint hearted, but we have a lot of support on our side and have established good working
relationships with local manufacturers such that when we recruit our new
employees they will be trained up by our partner organisations by working in
their office and production areas under close supervision.  We want to get our work practices right from
the outset so that when we lease our new premises we will be able to hit the
ground running –as they say. 




Quality and maintaining
morale:
When I was much younger, as an apprentice, I found myself
having to do lots of repetitive work which quickly became really, really
boring.  Conscious of the fact that there
will be a number of operations in the production process, the warehouse and in
the office which will fall into this category we will set up small teams or
cells of people, each with a team leader and rotate their jobs each month on a
competitive and fair basis.  Hopefully
this will reduce monotony, give a sense of personal achievement and broaden
each employee’s understanding of where they fit in, and fully appreciate the value of their own contribution.  The many visitors
that we plan to have on a regular basis will also help to maintain a high level
of interest and involvement.  
  
Product development
journey:
We have spent six years developing our range of products
from scratch and over the coming months, and with your help we will complete
this process by mid-2016 and step up to the plate as a ‘volume manufacturer’.  
However we do ask that you afford us one caveat: Our new
SMART POLYMER Liquid Lever Kink Valve is acknowledged globally as a step-change
invention for the irrigation industry, and likened to the electrical industry's micro-switch. 
Once the Hose extruder line is running satisfactorily and our staff are
confident, we will use the weekend downtime to run the extruder, with some
extra gear so that it can co-extrude our special Liquid Lever polymers.  For commercial reasons this bit is still
under wraps but we promise that you will be the first to know when we have
reached the end of our development journey and of course be the first to
receive Liquid Lever Kink Valves from the line.  Our
extruder trials are now just one step away from completion and we have already
tested the co-polymers for 1,800 wet and dry cycles – equivalent to approx. six
years of use in the field.  
Thank you for your patience and for being a part of this
journey.











Together the Liquid Lever team have over a 100 years of combined
experience in product design, collaboration and bringing products to market.


















They work by gravity (zero energy) from a tank of water – any kind of water, turbid, etc.  In many cases the water tank can be stood on the ground. 
Each kit comprises connectors and hoses which are joined together (push fit) and laid out on the ground in an array to provide one dripper per plant for water to drip out onto the soil.
We have developed two unique types of dripper, one for salad & row crops and one for trees & shrubs, called the SqueezeMe and the NEW Liquid Lever respectively.  The SqueezeMe Emitter is adjustable and made from two parts, uniquely it can be pinched or squeezed to flush out trapped debris. The NEW Liquid Lever Kink Valve is based on SMART POLYMERS which respond to local moisture or the lack of it.  In practice each tree or shrub controls its own watering. 
As the plant sucks the ground dry the Liquid Lever un-kinks to allow the flow of irrigation water out onto the ground until it is re-wetted sufficiently and then it kinks closed again until the next time.








By continuous co-extrusion of the Liquid Lever Kink Valve profile and selective cutting:



Your support will fund the custom build and installation of the Co-extrusion Line which comprises the four following basic items of equipment:

















Our sub-contractors in the UK manufacture all of our components using our own custom plastic injection moulding tools for the connectors, and extrusion dies for the Hoses and Liquid Lever Kink Valves. 



Our Manifold Moulding Tool LL06 running at our sub-contractor in the UK:

 More of our moulding tools...













Are you a non-profit organisation?


No and Yes.  The Applicant is Liquid Lever Irrigation Ltd in the UK and the funding is to enable our new company Liquid Lever (Kenya) Ltd to manufacture and supply our range of products in Africa.  Grow More Food is our UK registered charity.





Grow More Food holds the Master Licence to all of the technology and has sub-licensed the manufacturing and distribution rights to LLI Ltd & LLK Ltd, in return for a 5% Royalty on sales anywhere in the world.   These royalties are used to donate drip kits to families in Africa who can’t afford them.  This is the ‘Object’ of the charity.


Mike the founder and inventor has licensed all of the intellectual property to Grow More Food. All the Agreements are in place now, and we can’t wait to get started.  So far it’s just been a pilot run.



How many plants can you water?
It depends on the height of the water tank.  We make drip kits from 10 Plant to 500 Plant for water tanks from 0-1 metre elevation and have successfully trialled 1,200 Plant kits with a 2 metre tank elevation.  But a number of Kenyan Farmers now are pushing the boundaries with elevated tanks (3-5 metres) and hope to operate up to 5,000 drippers at a time.  These early customers are extremely enthusiastic and will quickly find out what the practical limit is – and let us know.  There is something of a competition going on between them.

How long will the drip kits last?
Our connectors and hoses are made from polymers used in the automotive industry, their properties are well documented and they have life expectancies in excess of 10 years.

What are the benefits to African Families?
We have grown crops in Kenya very successfully using our drip kits which, when we measure the outcomes we can show a 44 week payback period just from growing cabbages.  Using local shops on the outskirts of Nairobi as price guides.
Successful drip irrigation will extend the growing season for families so that crops can be available when external supplies are dwindling and becoming more costly.  Our drip irrigation takes this to the next level as it can be kept operating even when the quality of the feed water is deteriorating for example, due to a drop in the water table.

Why Kenya?



Kenya is where we plan to establish ourselves first, and supply drip kits throughout East Africa.

In readiness we have set up our new company Liquid Lever (Kenya) Ltd in Nairobi and our new staff will be encouraged to be outgoing and outward thinking. We have an open door policy Monday to Friday and will encourage people from Africa and overseas to visit the factory and spread the word about our products and our continuing story of the people who make them.

We can ship our finished mouldings (connectors) from Felixstowe docks in the UK to Mombasa sea port and by lorry on to Nairobi.


Similarly our polymers to make Hoses and Liquid Lever Kink Valves can follow the same route.  The sea journey is 38 days.


For us this is the best option at this time as; (a) we love the people, (b) we love the country, (c) many people are multi-lingual (d) the commercial and legal systems are similar to ours, (e) the African Headquarters of the UN is based in Nairobi and many of the well-known NGO’s have country offices and field staff there.  This is important as a portion of our work is geared towards providing drip kits at subsidised cost to remote communities through DFID and USAID funded initiatives. 


However that said, we keep receiving enquiries for our drip kit technology from people in other sub-Saharan countries and Southern Africa and West Africa. So it could be that our Kenya operation will quickly reveal the perfect framework for us to repeat it in other regions of Africa.  Keeping the costs down and helping us to reach as wide an audience as possible.  


We are building good relations with a number of local manufacturers, distributors and commercial organisations which see us as adding value to their own enterprise as our products are complementary.

We have chosen Kenya as our starting point but already have enquiries to establish manufacturing elsewhere in Africa. Family needs are the same wherever you go - people need to grow more food.





Will this project help
the environment if it is widely adopted?

Yes – in any arid and
remote location the benefits are twofold:




Converting barren land to productive land with
mixed plant species e.g., trees, shrubs, vines and salad crops creates micro habitats for
all kinds of flora and fauna.


Displacement pumping irrigation water for community projects instead of
pressure pumping saves approx. 85% of the energy normally associated with
conventional drip irrigation. 






I have other questions that aren’t shown here – where do I go?

The $100,000 goal for this campaign
will cover the list.  

For your pledge you will receive some pretty sweet Banshee swag.  Starting at a
 *$10 pledge you will receive a Banshee sticker. At *$25 we'll add a Koozie to the
mix.  For *$50 you get a Banshee t-shirt in the size of your choice. Jump
to *$100 and you get a pint glass with logo.  *$250 will get you forever
immortalized in the tasting room with your name branded onto the wall of donors. 
*$350 gets you an invite to the Grand Opening celebration in August 2016 and a
collectable coin with the Banshee logo and seal. *$500 or more level you will
receive a soft-sided cooler to keep all your favorite Banshee brews at their
perfect tasting temperature. *$750 you will receive a Banshee Brewing Company
pitcher and a set of 4 pint glasses.  *$1,500 We will let the lucky donator be
an ASSISTANT BREWER – Come to the brewery and see firsthand how it's done. If
you are unable to come to the brewery due to your location, we will substitute
a Beginning Homebrew Kit and Beer Recipe Kit to get you started on brewing your
own beer. *$3,000 you will create and name a seasonal brew (of your preference,
subject to final governmental label approval and owner approval) If it turns
out to be a crowd pleaser, we'll add it to our permanent list of seasonal
releases and live on in immortality each year we brew it! *$5,000 This is the
top of the line, ultimate private party at Banshee Brewing Company's Brewery
& Taphouse. Includes a private party for up to 24 people, Unlimited Banshee
drinks, Hors d'oeuvres and a tour of the brewery. Plus, take home a Banshee
pint glass for each of your guests. (All perks are cumulative. You get the
stuff from your contribution level, as well as everything below it.)
    Risks & Challenges  The beer industry is a highly regulated industry. We must obtain numerous permits, licenses. and secure a location. This, of course, means that we are working with the government, and are at their mercy/time frame. Banshee Brewing Company has already begun the permitting process; however, unforeseen events in dealing with the government and renovations could slow our estimated timeline.
    Other Ways You Can Help 

We know that cash isn't the only way to get where we are going; if you have any skills and extra time on your hands, we'd love to know how you may be able to help us in other ways around the brewery.  Every day there's something new going in or up and we pay handsomely in beer and pizza should you want to get your hands dirty with us!
You can also help by getting the word out about our campaign to your friends, colleagues and loved ones via social media platforms.  If everyone is able to share this campaign with just a few people, we feel confident that we can reach many, many people that may be interested in donating to the cause.
Any and all support is invaluable for our effort.
Thanks for reading, we look forward to seeing you at the brewery you helped build very soon!",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h1>'FromYou' Not for Profit</h1><h3>""Bringing Donators and Charities together"" </h3><p>FromYou is a App based Point to Point Not for Profit service, based in Perth, Western Australia. We aim to <b>make donating easier</b>, to<b> increase </b>donations and <b>bring donating to charities to a technologically savvy way </b>where things are done by the touch of a finger! </p>
<p>
</p><p>I see every day, charities like the Salvation army and Good Sammy’s being abused and bombarded with people dumping their trash and other unused goods where they are unable to be used or sold. It is estimated to cost over $200,000 Australian dollars every year, for every charity to clean up this mess. What a waste of money! I want that money, those resources and that energy to be dedicated to going to the charities true purpose, helping those in need! </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is imposing huge costs to the charities, and the current “Charity bin” system in Australia looses over 40% of donations because people put their personal waste into the bins. That is 40% of clothing that could have been donated to some of the 100,000 homeless people currently in Australia. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>FromYou is a Point to Point service, that allows busy people who normally don't get the time to donate or don’t know how to donate, to be able to donate their clothes through an interactive app based program. The service includes a personalised pick up from their home and then be able to track the progress of their donation to the charity of their donation. They will also have the opportunity to donate for the service ranging from either $1 or $100 and all the proceeds will also go to charity! The entire service is designed to make donating seamless and easy for people who live face paced lifestyles. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p><p></p><h3><i></i></h3><p><i style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;""></i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456929454/y9wuqtpcugioq3q6h8be.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2><b>Our goal: </b></h2>

Short Summary
We are the Boavista Official Group (from Humana Skala company) and we promote the official brand of the island, but in this case we are just some people who love this island and their inhabitants.
After the passage of hurricane FRED (31 ago 2015), every person on the island was damaged directly or indirectly. Many people have lost their homes or their job opportunity.   What We Need 
The authorities of Bovista and national authorities of Cape Verde were not prepared in a similar event as the archipelago is not a place of hurricanes.
Although there were no victims, we believe that this wonderful island need your help.
If you've been here, you will have noticed the simplicity of these people and we ask ourselves this question: they deserve our help?
$ 400,000 are not the full costs they will face to rebuild, but it's a start in which you can put back the pre-hurricane conditions.
Boavista, the wonderful island, it needs the support of all.   The Impact 
If every tourist who visited Boavista last year donates $10, we may collect 3 million in a few days. You can pay with your Credit Card, Bank Account or Paypal.We work closely with the local authorities and national and we turn especially to:
- All tourists have visited Boavista

Breve riepilogo

Noi siamo il gruppo Boavista Official (parte della società Humana Skala) e promuoviamo l'immagine ufficiale dell'isola, ma in questo caso siamo solo alcune persone che amano quest'isola e i suoi abitanti.
Dopo il passaggio dell'uragano FRED (31 Agosto 2015), ogni persona sull'isola è stata danneggiata direttamente o indirettamente. Molte persone hanno perso la casa e la loro opportunità di lavoro.



Quello che ci serve

Le autorità comunali e nazionali non erano preparate a un evento simile perchè l'arcipelago non è abitualmente un luogo di uragani (l'ultimo risale al 1892).
Anche se non ci sono state vittime, crediamo che questa meravigliosa isola abbia bisogno del nostro aiuto.
Se siete stati qui, avrete notato la semplicità di queste persone e vogliamo porci questa domanda: si meritano il nostro aiuto?
$ 400,000 non sono la totalità dei costi che dovranno affrontare per la ricostruzione, ma è un inizio con cui si possono ritrovare le condizioni pre-uragano.
Boavista, l'isola meravigliosa, ha bisogno del sostegno di tutti.


L'Impatto

Se ogni turista che ha visitato Boavista lo scorso anno donasse $10, potremmo raccogliere 3 milioni in pochi giorni. Si può donare con carta di credito, conto bancario o Paypal.
Lavoriamo a stretto contatto con le autorità locali e nazionali e ci rivolgiamo in particolare a:
- Tutti i turisti hanno visitato Boavista
- Tutti i cittadini di Capo Verde che possono aiutare
- Tutte le autorità dei paesi legati a Capo Verde
- Tutte le persone che hanno a cuore il futuro di questo piccolo paradiso


Rischi e Sfide

Per valutare l'importanza della campagna, è possibile visitare il sito web del Comune di Boavista (www.municipiodaboavista.cv) e verificare la sua affidabilità.
Inoltre, è possibile visitare il sito ufficiale dell'isola (www.boavistaofficial.com) e avere un'ulteriore conferma o controllare le notizie sul giornale locale ASEMANA (http://asemana.sapo.cv/spip.php?article112722&a...)
Il lato difficile della campagna di raccolta fondi riguarda la destinazione finale dei soldi raccolti: entro 2 mesi saranno elencate sui siti ufficiali e su FB tutte le opere a cui verranno destinati i fondi.

</h3>Coming from the grassroots DIY music scene, Nick and Chad were very accustomed to building from nothing and using whatever means to do so. As opposed to letting this hold us back, we explored an alternative method and used it to it's potential. We searched out one of the top breweries in the Midwest and worked with them to refine our recipes to large batch and went directly into packaging and retail distribution. This is something most beer companies attempt after establishing their brewery, taproom and brand. We pushed our products hard locally, hit the the regional craft beer events, handed out a million samples and gained incredible support from beer lovers throughout the region. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444067209/meiexkj5utdr48nvfdbk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3><b>About Us</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Who are we? Well, we are a very determined and maybe a
little nutty, family.  For years we have
had the dream of starting an 8 acre vegetable and perennial farm in Southern
Maine.  In 2013 the dream began.  In 2014, Lilac Lane Farm was incorporated and
started growing the first 8500 perennials from seed.  Perennials such as Shasta Daisies, Columbine,
Foxglove, Oriental poppies and more.  But
here is the “thing”.  It all started in
the 14x70 mobile home we are living in, 2 adults, a five year old, a one year
old, three cats and 8500 seedlings. 
Special racks were designed and built to minimize the space needed and
to take full advantage of the sun coming in the large living room windows.  But that was the easy part.  The real challenge came in transplanting the
seedlings and growing them to a marketable size.  But we did it! 
We figured that even tough things may not be just as we want them, we
needed to figure out how to work with what we had at that moment.  Well, we did and Lilac lane Farm was born.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449367374/f0gdnz6lwecagfbukfqp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div><br/></div>So, now we have a system to grow the perennials from seed
that we know works and works well.  Ok,
so that got the farm started but now Lilac Lane Farm needed the land and a
larger home for the family and farm. 
This past summer, 2015, I was looking through Craigslist and there was
this beautiful, charming, antique cape and barn for sale at a very reasonable
price.  The catch, well, it needed to be
dismantled and move relatively quickly.  So,
of course, I answered the ad. 
After seeing this antique cape, I gleefully informed the rest of the
family that they were going to have that big house and barn a bit sooner than
anticipated.  Isabella and Callan were ecstatic
with the prospect.  Cliff however, was a
bit terrified by the thought and wanted to know how on earth two people were
going to take down a 200+ year old house and barn in a matter of months.  Well, despite the challenges that presented
themselves along the way, we did it!  And we now have a beautiful antique cape with attached barn  packed safely away for the
winter in a 40 foot mobile storage container ready to be rebuilt in the
spring.  We at Lilac Lane Farm, know we can accomplish
anything we put our minds to and we embrace the hard work it takes to do so.</div><div>

</div></div>","About Us

Who are we? Well, we are a very determined and maybe a
little nutty, family.  For years we have
had the dream of starting an 8 acre vegetable and perennial farm in Southern
Maine.  In 2013 the dream began.  In 2014, Lilac Lane Farm was incorporated and
started growing the first 8500 perennials from seed.  Perennials such as Shasta Daisies, Columbine,
Foxglove, Oriental poppies and more.  But
here is the “thing”.  It all started in
the 14x70 mobile home we are living in, 2 adults, a five year old, a one year
old, three cats and 8500 seedlings. 
Special racks were designed and built to minimize the space needed and
to take full advantage of the sun coming in the large living room windows.  But that was the easy part.  The real challenge came in transplanting the
seedlings and growing them to a marketable size.  But we did it! 
We figured that even tough things may not be just as we want them, we
needed to figure out how to work with what we had at that moment.  Well, we did and Lilac lane Farm was born.



So, now we have a system to grow the perennials from seed
that we know works and works well.  Ok,
so that got the farm started but now Lilac Lane Farm needed the land and a
larger home for the family and farm. 
This past summer, 2015, I was looking through Craigslist and there was
this beautiful, charming, antique cape and barn for sale at a very reasonable
price.  The catch, well, it needed to be
dismantled and move relatively quickly.  So,
of course, I answered the ad. 
After seeing this antique cape, I gleefully informed the rest of the
family that they were going to have that big house and barn a bit sooner than
anticipated.  Isabella and Callan were ecstatic
with the prospect.  Cliff however, was a
bit terrified by the thought and wanted to know how on earth two people were
going to take down a 200+ year old house and barn in a matter of months.  Well, despite the challenges that presented
themselves along the way, we did it!  And we now have a beautiful antique cape with attached barn  packed safely away for the
winter in a 40 foot mobile storage container ready to be rebuilt in the
spring.  We at Lilac Lane Farm, know we can accomplish
anything we put our minds to and we embrace the hard work it takes to do so.

Risks & Challenges
 The risks and challenges associated with farming are many.  Weather, soil health, pests, mechanical failure, long physically taxing hours, just to name a few.  Similar were the risks and challenges involved in two people dismantling a 200+ year old farm house and attached barn and packing it into a 40 foot mobile storage container in three months.  We proudly accomplished that goal despite the perception of most that we were crazy to even try.  With careful planning we can minimize the risks and we know we will overcome any challenges that may present themselves,  because we have before.  Sometimes it just takes a little extra persistence, creativity and ""out of the box"" thinking to come up with solutions to the challenges.   There is always a solution its just a matter of finding it.

<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;"">It goes without saying that we are passionate about food and we enjoy sharing our passion with others.  In short, food lets us be part of so many other peoples' lives.</span></h3>
<p>To that end, we would like to bring a part of where Brandon grew up (California) to Lancaster PA.  And, that is authentic and fresh Mexican food! </p>
<p>Having been transplanted to Southern California at the age to 14, Brandon quickly fell in love with the beach, surfing and (most importantly!) Mexican food.  Coming from an eclectic family, Brandon also had the opportunity to learn his family members' recipes from Mexico that have become part of my family's traditions. </p>
<p>This IndieGoGo Fundraising Campaign is very close to our hearts for several reasons: (1) With our upbringing, we want people to understand what REAL Mexican food tastes like; (2) We want to share our joint passion for fresh and flavorful food with those who deserve it; and (3) We want to help our community by creating jobs and <span style=""background-color: initial;"">using local suppliers while also making and providing amazing food!</span></p>
<p>As a contributor you will help us to create a place that friends and family's will come to enjoy great food, and conversation. you will also help fund local artists. We plan to commission them to create limited addition prints on a monthly bases and give them to customers. We will also have local artist show case their talents on the walls of our restaurant.  </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<p>We are asking for $35,000 to move from our food truck to a store-front location.  Your funding will help us with the following: We have looked at few locations in the city of Lancaster, Ideally we are looking for a space that has a Kitchen built and hood in place. If that is not possible we will have to purchase equipment i.e. a range, refrigeration, fryers. We will also need to build out the kitchen. This will consist of tile for the floor and stainless steel or tile for the walls, we will need tables, chairs and fixtures,  as well as kitchen utensils and a small point of Sale system.</p>
<p>Our perks will  be a single sticker with our logo for a small donation to , pendents, and  limited addition prints with a Dia de Los Muertos theme for a larger donation to this project.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> Prints will be made monthly and be created by  local artists; showcasing a new artist every month. </span></p>

</div><div>
<div>There are always risks and challenges with any new business. the challenges that we will face are many. We may have to build the kitchen from scratch, and with any construction there are always unforeseen challenges that may delay or increase the cost of opening the restaurant. We will have to get construction permits, the kitchen will need to pass a health certification,  We will be required to obtain the proper licensure from the city. </div>
<div>We feel that all of these challenges can be meet and over come.

I would like to introduce ourselves. We are Red Toad Tacos! 


We (Brandon Green and David Rupp  have been in the culinary industry for a combined 30 years.  We started a catering company a few years back and it has grown and changed directions over the last 3 years.  We then purchased a food truck and started a taco concept based on authentic Mexican street food.  NOW, it is time to open a store front and continue to share our yummy Mexican food . 

It goes without saying that we are passionate about food and we enjoy sharing our passion with others.  In short, food lets us be part of so many other peoples' lives.
To that end, we would like to bring a part of where Brandon grew up (California) to Lancaster PA.  And, that is authentic and fresh Mexican food! 
Having been transplanted to Southern California at the age to 14, Brandon quickly fell in love with the beach, surfing and (most importantly!) Mexican food.  Coming from an eclectic family, Brandon also had the opportunity to learn his family members' recipes from Mexico that have become part of my family's traditions. 
This IndieGoGo Fundraising Campaign is very close to our hearts for several reasons: (1) With our upbringing, we want people to understand what REAL Mexican food tastes like; (2) We want to share our joint passion for fresh and flavorful food with those who deserve it; and (3) We want to help our community by creating jobs and using local suppliers while also making and providing amazing food!
As a contributor you will help us to create a place that friends and family's will come to enjoy great food, and conversation. you will also help fund local artists. We plan to commission them to create limited addition prints on a monthly bases and give them to customers. We will also have local artist show case their talents on the walls of our restaurant.     What We Need & What You Get

We are asking for $35,000 to move from our food truck to a store-front location.  Your funding will help us with the following: We have looked at few locations in the city of Lancaster, Ideally we are looking for a space that has a Kitchen built and hood in place. If that is not possible we will have to purchase equipment i.e. a range, refrigeration, fryers. We will also need to build out the kitchen. This will consist of tile for the floor and stainless steel or tile for the walls, we will need tables, chairs and fixtures,  as well as kitchen utensils and a small point of Sale system.
Our perks will  be a single sticker with our logo for a small donation to , pendents, and  limited addition prints with a Dia de Los Muertos theme for a larger donation to this project.
 Prints will be made monthly and be created by  local artists; showcasing a new artist every month. 

The Impact

Your contribution will help Red Toad Tacos become a Reality. You will help us make the last three years of hard work bare fruit. Your contribution will help us to create great environment where will be able to share our love of great freshly made food, with the community, and create new friends. Lastly your contribution will help us add to the richness of the city of Lancaster and it's community.

Risks & Challenges

There are always risks and challenges with any new business. the challenges that we will face are many. We may have to build the kitchen from scratch, and with any construction there are always unforeseen challenges that may delay or increase the cost of opening the restaurant. We will have to get construction permits, the kitchen will need to pass a health certification,  We will be required to obtain the proper licensure from the city. 
We feel that all of these challenges can be meet and over come. As for the risks that we face there are many; from a lack of interest where we make it but it never really takes off; to the flat out failure of the concept, but we have been in business for 3 years starting our catering company out of three plastic tubs, and taking that and making it into a food truck business and now we would like to make it into a store front with your help.  Our plan is to have the Funding in place, secure the licences needed, so we can have the work begin.

To achieve this goal, we will partner with an established NGO, Clean Water for Haiti, whose technical expertise has been repeatedly proven by their installation of more than 20,000 filters since 2001. Clean Water for Haiti will implement a comprehensive training course for an UNOGA student leader and staff member. In addition, we will develop an income-generating business plan to support the biosand filter operations and educational programs at UNOGA. We will collaborate with UNOGA students to provide clean water and training materials for St. Pierre, a local primary school, and the broader community. The soil lab will provide tools to map out and trace the ecological impact of soil erosion. UNOGA will share the testing results through its extensive local network to guide farmers’ agricultural practices, improving crop yields and reducing soil degradation. These projects will enhance UNOGA’s agricultural and business curriculum and benefit the local community. The recycling project with alleviate the rampart littering problem around UNOGA while providing the students with a new place to study agriculture. We also hope to push the recycling project forward to other parts of Haiti with the help of UNOGA students and faculties. Here's what we need from you in order to complete the projects. We would greatly appreciate your monetary aid and help in spreading our voice.

Hello
my name is Shemmyla Green and I'm the owner of The Empowerment Firm. I am
currently developing a pilot program for service women, women vets and military

Women in the military community are increasing and under

The Team
We are a close knit team here of socially conscious business people who really want to see a healthy change in the world.Lead by Greg Gomez, and his awesome Boston Terrier Bella, the team at Nautilus Nutritional's are in safe hands.



                 




Greg - Founder                                              Bella - Spokesdog
                          Greg has over 30 years experience in building and developing businesses and has worked in the data and finance industries for many  years. 
Two years ago Greg made the decision to follow his curiosity about nutrition and explore the powerful benefits of healing and restoration of superfoods on the body. 
He also recognized that many of the energy products available on the shelves for consumers didn't seem to have evolved and so he decided to explore the most effective and healthy way to energize the body and came up with the first in a line of 8 products for Nautilus Nutritional's - PowerShot.
Greg's research investigations lead to the development of Nautilus Nutritional's, a socially conscious nutrition company that is 'thriven' thriving and driven. 

                
Nautilus4life.com the company website is a source of information on energizing naturally, with articles and reports on the benefits of superfoods and the truth behind using natural energy boosting ingredients as opposed to the products on the shelves in most supermarkets. 

              At Nautilus Nutritional's, our cause of choice is Diabetes. The onslaught and increase in Diabetes across the US is cause for concern for many, and with Greg experiencing first hand the devastating benefits of the conditionon a close family member, Diabetes is a huge motivator in delivering a range of products suitable for Diabetics along with anyone else who needs an energy boost. The company  share a percentage of profits with children's Diabetes charities that help with diagnostics and treatments of type 1 and 2 Diabetes.

<p>Fikra
Space provides budding Iraqi entrepreneurs access to a co-working space,
mentorship and training at no charge. Our doors are open to anyone who wants to
start a business or grow an existing one, share his / her knowledge or learn
from the community. Fikra Space has accumulated a community of 19,000+ engaged
and active members. We have organised more than 200 events that have been
attended by more than 10,000 attendees. </p>
<p>We
organised the first ever start-up weekends in Baghdad and Basrah to plant the
seeds for the Iraqi ecosystem of tech entrepreneurs. We followed up with weekly
events that focused on knowledge sharing and capacity building to grow and
nurture the ecosystem. Some of these events were technical workshops in C++,
Java, Android and Arduino and where we tested new and disruptive products such
as Arduino microcontrollers, Rasperry Pi and 3D printers. We also helped
entrepreneurs market and sell their ideas through photography courses and
market strategy sessions. Our work is all non-profit, our members are all
volunteers.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432845181/sxnqr5scqn2lhqbxs9ud.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/></p><h4><b>That’s

government has recognised our work and asked us to help draft a regulatory
framework for technology incubators in Iraq. We are just in the beginning, but
we are making progress in building Iraq’s technology sector from scratch.<br/><br/></p><h4><b>That’s
impressive, but what's the bigger purpose?</b></h4>
<p>Iraq
is a country of many contrasts. Its biggest opportunities are often its biggest
challenges:</p><p></p><ul><li>
<b>Rich Iraq, poor Iraq? <br/></b>Iraq is one of the richest countries in the world with abundant natural resources<br/>More than 20% (6.2 MM people) of the population lives below the poverty line <br/>
</li></ul><ul><li>
<b>The
cradle of civilisation back to the Stone Age? <br/></b>The first written alphabet was invented in Mesopotamia, modern day Iraq<br/>More than 20% (4.2 MM people) of Iraq’s adult population is illiterate<br/>
</li></ul><p></p><ul><li>
<b>Young but idle?<br/></b>Iraq is one of the most youthful nations in the world<br/>Youth unemployment in Iraq is among the highest in the region at 34%<br/>
</li></ul><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p>Youth
unemployment and economic hardship are directly linked to the wave of extremism
that has swept Iraq since 2014. Young people who lack jobs and who face
widespread corruption on a daily basis may see few options available to them
other than joining extremist groups to earn a living. This is particularly true
for Iraq where ISIS recruits are typically between the ages of 16 and 25 and
can reportedly earn up to US$1,000 per month. </p>
<p>Our
purpose is to empower our young community by creating opportunities and
rewarding entrepreneurship. As a free-of-charge, open-for-all institution, we
offer a fresh contrast to many of Iraq’s public and private institutions that
are often plagued by corruption. We want to cultivate a culture of mentorship,
hard work, teamwork and success among our members. We hope to spread this
culture to the entire youth population through our success stories, the likes
of S Convert, Journal, Mu3amala and d3. Ultimately, we believe that empowering
youth is the way forward for a peaceful and prosperous Iraq.</p><p></p>

guys rock, but why do you need my help?</b></h4>
<p>We
have created a great platform for entrepreneurship with very limited means. For
example, we have organised more than 200 events without actually having a
permanent place. Instead, we have had to rely on NGOs to lend us their places post
work hours to hold our events. Also, we have helped entrepreneurs develop
prototypes and businesses without owning any technical equipment. Instead, our
core members have brought their own from home to share with the community.
On top of that, we have mentored and trained entrepreneurs without having any full-time employees, mentors or trainers. Instead,
our core members are volunteers that take on such positions in tandem with
having full-time jobs elsewhere.</p>
<p>We are
very proud to have achieved great results with limited means. But our community
is growing rapidly, and it needs attention on a continuous basis to mature. To give
them more attention, we need to grow with them. And for that, we need your
support.</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432888287/qbw566t0i3fttzrkyyor.png"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/><br/></p><h4>Trust me I want to help, but isn't supporting the technology sector in Iraq a little premature?</h4><p>Iraq represents a great opportunity for early movers and pioneers. The country is embracing technology at a rapid pace driven by a young, entrepreneurial and resilient population, continuous development and openness, and a strong consumption coupled with a lack of basic services.</p><ul><li>
<b>Young, entrepreneurial and resilient population</b><br/>52% of Iraq’s population is below 19 years<br/>34% of the workforce is comprised of self-employed entrepreneurs<br/>Iraqis remain united and defiant in the face of violence and extremism</li></ul><ul><li>
<b>Continuous development and openness</b><br/>Internet penetration nearly doubled in 2014<br/>IQ Networks is investing US$100 MM in a broadband cable throughout Iraq<br/>Iraq is the only real democracy in the Middle East</li></ul><ul><li>
<b>Strong consumption and a lack of basic services</b><br/>Household consumption is 65% of GDP<br/>Private sector must expand as economy transitions to free economy<br/>Country needs to “catch up” with world after decades of wars and sanctions</li></ul><div>
<p>Perspective
is key, and we feel that it is absent in the outside world’s view of Iraq. Usually
the bad news gets out and the good news doesn't. Little coverage is given to
success stories from Iraq. Success stories such as the mobile sector for
example. In 2003, mobile penetration in Iraq was 0%. In 2013, it was nearly
100%. The country recently rolled out 3G services. But even prior to that,
smartphone penetration was at 30%. People want change, and they adapt to it
rapidly.</p>
<p>A
similar success story is in the making. Internet penetration stands at a low 25%
but is growing rapidly. According to the GSMA commission, it is estimated that,
with access to suitable radio spectrum and fibre infrastructure, the number of
mobile broadband connections in Iraq could reach more than 30 MM by 2025 (i.e.
85% penetration). This growth has the potential to stimulate profound economic
value in Iraq over the next decade, including an additional US$102 BN in GDP,
270,000 new businesses and an additional 530,000 full-time jobs.</p>

<h4><b>It sounds
promising, but there must be huge challenges?</b></h4>
<p>Iraq
is not an easy country for doing business; the environment is particularly
tough on entrepreneurs. Instability, corruption and lack of funding are the
three major challenges making an entrepreneur’s life difficult. But as the
saying goes, when the going gets tough, the tough gets going. We are resilient
and we are problem solvers:</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<b>Instability </b>Iraqi entrepreneur Ammar Ameen launched Iraq’s first ecommerce platform Miswag.net in April 2014. Its success was imminent as hundreds of people placed orders in May. Then ISIS swept through northern and western Iraq in June. Social media was subsequently blocked for a couple of months, shutting Ammar’s most important marketing channel. So what did Ammar do? He used the downtime to improve the platform, analysing data he gathered from customers and made sure to come back with a better product. In April 2015, Ammar relaunched with another big, successful campaign.</li></ul>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<b>Corruption </b><b style=""background-color: initial;""></b><p style=""display: inline !important;"">Iraq
is ranked 156 out of 189 countries in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business
Index. Government processes in Iraq are long and tiresome, and prone to
corruption and bribery. Up to 40% of start-ups operate without going through
the formal registration process, primarily to circumvent bureaucracy and
corruption. As a result, it is difficult for start-ups to do business and take
off. So how do we solve it? Fikra Space has launched Mu3amala, a crowdsourcing
platform that lists all the documents, steps and costs required for every government process. Mu3amala <b></b></p>
<p style=""display: inline !important;"">promotes transparency and lets citizens directly call out corruption. </p>
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<b>Lack of funding </b>The Iraqi economy is dominated by the public sector. The private sector is mainly comprised of contractors that provide services to the government. Tech entrepreneurs are not on the priority list and finding funding for a tech start-up is a rarity. So how do we do it? Fikra Space approaches investors on behalf of entrepreneurs, allowing them to focus on running their business. We recently helped start-up d3 secure funding from an Iraqi investor. But most importantly, we have learned how to operate a lean start-up, to be fruitful and minimise costs and maximise revenues from the outset.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span>

is Fikra Space?Fikra
Space is a tech community founded in Baghdad in 2012. We bring Iraqi technology
enthusiasts together in an environment that encourages them to share their
ideas and work together to pursue them. Our goal is to promote entrepreneurship
and help young people create a better future for themselves.That sounds nice, but what do you actually do?
Fikra
Space provides budding Iraqi entrepreneurs access to a co-working space,
mentorship and training at no charge. Our doors are open to anyone who wants to
start a business or grow an existing one, share his / her knowledge or learn
from the community. Fikra Space has accumulated a community of 19,000+ engaged
and active members. We have organised more than 200 events that have been
attended by more than 10,000 attendees. 
We
organised the first ever start-up weekends in Baghdad and Basrah to plant the
seeds for the Iraqi ecosystem of tech entrepreneurs. We followed up with weekly
events that focused on knowledge sharing and capacity building to grow and
nurture the ecosystem. Some of these events were technical workshops in C++,
Java, Android and Arduino and where we tested new and disruptive products such
as Arduino microcontrollers, Rasperry Pi and 3D printers. We also helped
entrepreneurs market and sell their ideas through photography courses and
market strategy sessions. Our work is all non-profit, our members are all
volunteers.That’s
great, but any success so far?Fikra
Space has helped Iraqi entrepreneurs launch successful start-ups used by
thousands of people in Iraq and abroad. We helped them with anything from
design and development to sales and marketing. The
government has recognised our work and asked us to help draft a regulatory
framework for technology incubators in Iraq. We are just in the beginning, but
we are making progress in building Iraq’s technology sector from scratch.That’s
impressive, but what's the bigger purpose?
Iraq
is a country of many contrasts. Its biggest opportunities are often its biggest
challenges:
Rich Iraq, poor Iraq? Iraq is one of the richest countries in the world with abundant natural resourcesMore than 20% (6.2 MM people) of the population lives below the poverty line 

The
cradle of civilisation back to the Stone Age? The first written alphabet was invented in Mesopotamia, modern day IraqMore than 20% (4.2 MM people) of Iraq’s adult population is illiterate

Young but idle?Iraq is one of the most youthful nations in the worldYouth unemployment in Iraq is among the highest in the region at 34%
Youth
unemployment and economic hardship are directly linked to the wave of extremism
that has swept Iraq since 2014. Young people who lack jobs and who face
widespread corruption on a daily basis may see few options available to them
other than joining extremist groups to earn a living. This is particularly true
for Iraq where ISIS recruits are typically between the ages of 16 and 25 and
can reportedly earn up to US$1,000 per month. 
Our
purpose is to empower our young community by creating opportunities and
rewarding entrepreneurship. As a free-of-charge, open-for-all institution, we
offer a fresh contrast to many of Iraq’s public and private institutions that
are often plagued by corruption. We want to cultivate a culture of mentorship,
hard work, teamwork and success among our members. We hope to spread this
culture to the entire youth population through our success stories, the likes
of S Convert, Journal, Mu3amala and d3. Ultimately, we believe that empowering
youth is the way forward for a peaceful and prosperous Iraq.

You
guys rock, but why do you need my help?
We
have created a great platform for entrepreneurship with very limited means. For
example, we have organised more than 200 events without actually having a
permanent place. Instead, we have had to rely on NGOs to lend us their places post
work hours to hold our events. Also, we have helped entrepreneurs develop
prototypes and businesses without owning any technical equipment. Instead, our
core members have brought their own from home to share with the community.
On top of that, we have mentored and trained entrepreneurs without having any full-time employees, mentors or trainers. Instead,
our core members are volunteers that take on such positions in tandem with
having full-time jobs elsewhere.
We are
very proud to have achieved great results with limited means. But our community
is growing rapidly, and it needs attention on a continuous basis to mature. To give
them more attention, we need to grow with them. And for that, we need your
support.
Trust me I want to help, but isn't supporting the technology sector in Iraq a little premature?Iraq represents a great opportunity for early movers and pioneers. The country is embracing technology at a rapid pace driven by a young, entrepreneurial and resilient population, continuous development and openness, and a strong consumption coupled with a lack of basic services.
Young, entrepreneurial and resilient population52% of Iraq’s population is below 19 years34% of the workforce is comprised of self-employed entrepreneursIraqis remain united and defiant in the face of violence and extremism
Continuous development and opennessInternet penetration nearly doubled in 2014IQ Networks is investing US$100 MM in a broadband cable throughout IraqIraq is the only real democracy in the Middle East
Strong consumption and a lack of basic servicesHousehold consumption is 65% of GDPPrivate sector must expand as economy transitions to free economyCountry needs to “catch up” with world after decades of wars and sanctions
Perspective
is key, and we feel that it is absent in the outside world’s view of Iraq. Usually
the bad news gets out and the good news doesn't. Little coverage is given to
success stories from Iraq. Success stories such as the mobile sector for
example. In 2003, mobile penetration in Iraq was 0%. In 2013, it was nearly
100%. The country recently rolled out 3G services. But even prior to that,
smartphone penetration was at 30%. People want change, and they adapt to it
rapidly.
A
similar success story is in the making. Internet penetration stands at a low 25%
but is growing rapidly. According to the GSMA commission, it is estimated that,
with access to suitable radio spectrum and fibre infrastructure, the number of
mobile broadband connections in Iraq could reach more than 30 MM by 2025 (i.e.
85% penetration). This growth has the potential to stimulate profound economic
value in Iraq over the next decade, including an additional US$102 BN in GDP,
270,000 new businesses and an additional 530,000 full-time jobs.


It sounds
promising, but there must be huge challenges?
Iraq
is not an easy country for doing business; the environment is particularly
tough on entrepreneurs. Instability, corruption and lack of funding are the
three major challenges making an entrepreneur’s life difficult. But as the
saying goes, when the going gets tough, the tough gets going. We are resilient
and we are problem solvers:


Instability Iraqi entrepreneur Ammar Ameen launched Iraq’s first ecommerce platform Miswag.net in April 2014. Its success was imminent as hundreds of people placed orders in May. Then ISIS swept through northern and western Iraq in June. Social media was subsequently blocked for a couple of months, shutting Ammar’s most important marketing channel. So what did Ammar do? He used the downtime to improve the platform, analysing data he gathered from customers and made sure to come back with a better product. In April 2015, Ammar relaunched with another big, successful campaign.


Corruption Iraq
is ranked 156 out of 189 countries in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business
Index. Government processes in Iraq are long and tiresome, and prone to
corruption and bribery. Up to 40% of start-ups operate without going through
the formal registration process, primarily to circumvent bureaucracy and
corruption. As a result, it is difficult for start-ups to do business and take
off. So how do we solve it? Fikra Space has launched Mu3amala, a crowdsourcing
platform that lists all the documents, steps and costs required for every government process. Mu3amala 
promotes transparency and lets citizens directly call out corruption. 



Lack of funding The Iraqi economy is dominated by the public sector. The private sector is mainly comprised of contractors that provide services to the government. Tech entrepreneurs are not on the priority list and finding funding for a tech start-up is a rarity. So how do we do it? Fikra Space approaches investors on behalf of entrepreneurs, allowing them to focus on running their business. We recently helped start-up d3 secure funding from an Iraqi investor. But most importantly, we have learned how to operate a lean start-up, to be fruitful and minimise costs and maximise revenues from the outset.

</h3><p>I first became introduced to work with widows when I visited ‘Ma-Dham’, a home
for 75 widows that is run by an NGO, Guild for Service, in the holy village of Vrindavan.  Unfortunately, Indian
widows are often shunned from society and turned out by both their family and
their in-laws; they are not allowed to participate in large community events and
have become their own insular community. </p>
<p><br/></p><p>I sought to positively
impact the lives of widows and to create a self-sustaining cycle of change. After observing the
vocational training classes for the widows at the home, which consist of
learning how to sew or to make dried snacks, I realized that these skills
could be applied in a more meaningful way than selling the goods to fund
Ma-Dham’s activities. I recalled that the Guild for Service also holds a mass
marriage ceremony twice a year in which 30-40 couples are married
simultaneously, to discourage the discriminatory dowry tradition. In India dowry (or 'Dahej') is the durable goods, cash, and real or movable
property that is  given by the bride's family to the bridegroom, his parents, or his
relatives as a condition of the marriage. The NGO gives jewelry, clothes
and household items to each couple and finances the cost of the marriage. I
decided to link up these two important areas of work and encourage the widows
at ‘Ma-Dham’ to embroider ‘<i>sarees’</i> , a traditional indian dress
worn by the bride, that benefactors could finance and donate to the brides at
the mass marriages. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">

This idea
started a cycle that is beneficial for both the widows at Vrindavan as well as
the brides to be. I named this initiative ‘The Red Saree Movement’ as
a nod to the societal rule that widows must differentiate themselves from the
rest of the population by abstaining from colorful clothes and only wearing
while. The goal of this initiative is to create a circle that involves the
benefactors who finance the cloth for the sarees ,cloth bags and other items, the widows of Vrindavan who
make these items and use the excess donations to financially empower themselves,
and the brides-to-be, who receive a free sari and are thus better able to
escape the pressures of dowry. To encourage people to get involved with this
cycle and to help break the stigmas against widows, I created a

<p>As we speak new kind of jobs are appearing by the day. And old jobs are falling into oblivion fast. One cannot predict what’s going to happen next. Neither employers, nor job seekers have more than just little control of that, if any. Because today's and tomorrow's challenges can’t be solved using yesterday's methods. The cost this has to society is unfathomable. The impact it has on you is next to unbearable. </p>Your talent is desperately needed. And now. But first it must be found. And once found it must be matched with this one type of job that is right for you. Time is of the essence. Precision in matching jobs with talents is crucial.

<p>This is our first step to bring our endeavour to life. Our endeavour dedicated to you. We are building the ultimate online talent platform.</p>

<p>Hence, that’s why we create THE FLOAD™. We asked ourselves “why improving something by say 2% if it can be 100 times better?”.

<p>This is for you. The young and hopeful jobseeker eager to work the first time. And it is also for you, the experienced but disillusioned worker. You are in the quest to find a job, because you need to make ends meet. For yourself and also for your families. </p>
<p>It’s a never ending story, because the times they are changing. Already right now 75% of the working population worldwide have only short term temporary employment, are contractors, or have no contract at all (according to the UN / ILO). The results are uncertainty and also an increasing payment gap between the fewer employments with unlimited contracts and the temporary employments.</p>
<p>At the same time employers are having problems to find the best talents for their jobs. And enough of those. As a consequence employers miss the mark in 82% of their hiring decisions. </p>
<p>The traditional job search and hiring system can’t work in today’s and tomorrow’s environments, because it’s fundamentally flawed.</p>
<p>That’s how THE FLOAD™ was born. We, the people behind THE FLOAD™, developed since quite some time the idea for THE FLOAD™. We did that because we know from our personal experience how job search feels and how much the hiring process sucks. For both, employees and employers.</p>

<p>During my years in college and the military, I loved to go out and be around the people.  San Diego is known for great beach parties down by Pacific Beach and exciting nights down in the Gaslamp District.  I believed the saying that ""music is the universal language"".  In fact, while stationed overseas in Italy, a local lounge bar asked if I would play music, or DJ, at their bar to promote more customers who enjoyed music from stateside.  From there I began to develop an idea to make it easy to find venues that played the type of music you wanted to listen to.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The original concept of the app also provided a way to help DJ's (Disc Jockey's) find work wherever they were in the world.  I called the project, ""KnXM Worldwide"", a play on the words ""Connects 'em Worldwide"".  So, I spent a majority of 2014 doing research on all the apps for DJ's and music events.  What I found were apps that either costed a fortune for a subscription or only supported already famous artists.  </p>
<p>As I continued to review these apps, I began seeing and meeting artists around the area at the local scenes in Italy.  I was surprised to see that many of these artists were co-workers, parents, and people from the local area.  The best part was that we shared a common love of music and dancing.  On top of that, there was talent everywhere from singers to photographers to DJ's and dancers.  And though all of the people came from different backgrounds and cultures, we found a common bond not just in music, but through events and making friendships.  </p>

<p>I immediately changed the business concept and thought about making a app that shared every artist and business in the every community.  The app would promote and encourage events that people might be interested in and maybe did not know about.   All with the aim of promoting community reinvestment through social interaction and events.   </p>
<p>The app would provide a contemporary means of promoting yourself as:</p>

<p>Understand: the important part about living in the age of social media is to not forget to actually socially interact with each other.  To be afraid of rejection.  To find true love.  To share a moment with new and old friends.  To sing a song together.  To capture first moments.  And most of all, to be together as a people.  </p>

The golf course property has been severely neglected for the past few years and is in desperate need of repair and renovation. In particular, the original irrigation system from 1952 (it's original open year as a 9 hole course) is still in place and is in very poor condition and very inefficient. Adding fuel to the fire, California is currently experiencing the worst drought in generations. However, we are working with the Oceanside City Water Department to bring reclaimed water to Goat Hill Park by January 1, 2016. In order to use this reclaimed water, our current irrigation needs to be replaced, including our main line. This is a very unexpected, costly project. We are reaching out to the greater golf community around the country and the world, to ask for your help in repairing this historic municipal golf course. Our goal is to remain affordable and accessible for the working class golfer, the junior golfer, and to the entire community as a outdoor mecca of both recreation and socialization.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434701098/acyqsdunlybyhdoc3z2f.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b>Funding: </b></p><p></p><p>This funding campaign is directed toward the unanticipated cost
of a new mainline that will be able to tie into a reclaimed water source
provided by the City of Oceanside. Due to the unprecedented drought situation
of California, Goat Hill Park is in need of funding assistance to get through
this challenging time. Your contribution will go towards completing the
replacement of our faltering mainline. Once completed, we will be an example
of water efficiency for the golf world, and a steward of environmental
conservation. The cost for the size and scope of this project is estimated at
$250K-$400K.</p><p><b>Contribution:</b></p><p>Many of our friends are already in support of our cause, and have purchased the ""Save Goat Hill"" t-shirt to show it. A few of these include: Bill Murray, Kelly Slater, Adam Scott, and Geoff Ogilvy. Many of these supporters grew up themselves playing and caddying at ""muni"" golf courses in this country. We have already put an extensive amount of work rehabilitating the course from a ground level within these first 12 months of managing. Blood, sweat, tears, and plenty of love grazes this land each and every day. With your help, we can get there, not just as Goat Hill park, but as a community. </p><p>Please share this with your circle of friends, and support us on social media.

We have won over the fight to keep this a green space for recreation, enjoyment, a safe haven for kids, and a place for the community to gather.. and now, the work continues.Mission + Impact: Our mission is to restore and care for one of the last remaining coastal parklands in San Diego county. To renovate, maintain, promote and operate Goat Hill park to serve the community of Oceanside and citizens of North County looking to enjoy golf, recreation, and community activities at an affordable level. Goat Hill Park will be the permanent home of the North County Junior Golf Association and Caddie Academy, providing positive leadership and helping to cultivate education and job opportunities for Oceanside's youth. We feel a responsibility to the local community and to the game of golf. With a clean conscience, we could not stand by and watch a landmark golf course be destroyed. Back Story: With the local community strongly by their side, a group of locals took over the lease July 1, 2014 after battling a billionaire developer in city hall meetings. The golf course property has been severely neglected for the past few years and is in desperate need of repair and renovation. In particular, the original irrigation system from 1952 (it's original open year as a 9 hole course) is still in place and is in very poor condition and very inefficient. Adding fuel to the fire, California is currently experiencing the worst drought in generations. However, we are working with the Oceanside City Water Department to bring reclaimed water to Goat Hill Park by January 1, 2016. In order to use this reclaimed water, our current irrigation needs to be replaced, including our main line. This is a very unexpected, costly project. We are reaching out to the greater golf community around the country and the world, to ask for your help in repairing this historic municipal golf course. Our goal is to remain affordable and accessible for the working class golfer, the junior golfer, and to the entire community as a outdoor mecca of both recreation and socialization.Funding: This funding campaign is directed toward the unanticipated cost
of a new mainline that will be able to tie into a reclaimed water source
provided by the City of Oceanside. Due to the unprecedented drought situation
of California, Goat Hill Park is in need of funding assistance to get through
this challenging time. Your contribution will go towards completing the
replacement of our faltering mainline. Once completed, we will be an example
of water efficiency for the golf world, and a steward of environmental
conservation. The cost for the size and scope of this project is estimated at
$250K-$400K.Contribution:Many of our friends are already in support of our cause, and have purchased the ""Save Goat Hill"" t-shirt to show it. A few of these include: Bill Murray, Kelly Slater, Adam Scott, and Geoff Ogilvy. Many of these supporters grew up themselves playing and caddying at ""muni"" golf courses in this country. We have already put an extensive amount of work rehabilitating the course from a ground level within these first 12 months of managing. Blood, sweat, tears, and plenty of love grazes this land each and every day. With your help, we can get there, not just as Goat Hill park, but as a community. Please share this with your circle of friends, and support us on social media. We encourage you to contribute, and join us in aiding our mission. We hope you can see the potential in Goat Hill Park and the positive effect it can have on our ever-growing, beach side community. With GREAT appreciation... from all of us at Goat Hill Park, we thank you....and please come see us when you're in town. Contribution Gifts:Our ""perks"" are a great way to show your support on a daily basis. From golf gear, to art, we want you to know you're appreciated. ** Goat Hill Park will contact you shortly via email regarding choosing a shirt size, hat size, and/or color option**",9.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>My intention with Hedwig’s Hair Salon is for it to be a crucial establishment in the Riverwest community. I will be offering high quality haircuts at a moderate price in a manner which reflects the ethos of the neighborhood. I have lived in the Riverwest neighborhood for almost 8 years and I’ve been working at an established salon there for 2 ½ years.  At my previous job, I was given the opportunity to move up into a better and higher paid position. But it would have meant working outside of the neighborhood that I love. Riverwest is a great place to start a new business because the people here are excited about locally owned and run establishments that will better the neighborhood. I am looking forward to being a part of that and getting to know my neighbors better by cutting their hair and/or serving alongside of them in different capacities that are trying to better our community.</p>

<p>What if you could give someone a personal gift and you didn't have to leave your computer, or even search multiple websites until you find what you like? </p>
<p>What if in ten minutes you could pick out a gift for someone, then sit back and relax knowing the wrapping and shipping will be taken care of? </p>
<p>That is what Gyfstery does! Gyfstery is a mystery gift system that allows you to quickly and effortlessly pick out a gift for someone based on their personality. All you have to do is fill out a survey and we take care of the rest. </p>
<h3>Why would I use this?</h3> <p>Think about all of the times each year where you need to get a gift for someone. There are all sorts of occasions where you need to get someone a gift. From birthdays and holidays, to thank you gifts and those gifts for the times you just want someone to know you care, there are plenty of times we need to pick out gifts. But if you are like many other people, picking out gifts can be a complete hassle. You could always take the easy way out and send a gift certificate or cash, but there is no personal touch to that. So you decide you have to pick out a gift. There are so many factors that go into picking out a gift for someone. We all live super busy lives, and sometimes finding the time to go to the store and find a gift for someone can be difficult. Not only do you have to spend the time going to and from the store, or multiple stores if you can't find what you are looking for, you have to scour the store looking for a gift that the recipient might like. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Once you find the gift you want, you have to worry about getting the gift to the recipient.</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Then you have to get the gift wrapped.

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<div>Gyfstery is a simple process that takes you no more than ten minutes to complete start to finish. How it works is you tell us about the person you want to give a gift to. By using our simple survey, guided by pictures, you build a profile of the person you are giving a gift to by answer simple questions. Once you are done with all the questions, you are done. The survey questions are simple. They look like this:</div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1204277/files/20150207153822-survey1.JPG?1423352302"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<br/>
</div>
<div>Once you have completed the survey, your answers are run through our complex algorithm that breaks down your answers to help match the person you told us about to a gift in our inventory. We then take that gift, package it up, and send it on its way to the recipient.</div>
<h3>What kind of Gifts could I expect?</h3>
<p>Gyfstery takes pride in only sourcing our gifts with people that care about the products they make. We do not look for cheap items that we can buy in bulk. The items we source are of the highest quality and are items we ourselves would be happy to receive. We have traveled across Texas to farmer's markets and trade shows to find people and their products. As we grow we hope to reach further and further until we are finding suppliers from all over the United States. </p>

<p>Fundraiser banquet, opening night, private parties:  These events will showcase farm-to-table food made by our Executive Chef, and herbal teas made by the HerBlends of Plenty team.  Furthermore, we will have a cash bar during these events.  All of these events will probably fall on a Sunday, but we haven't decided on the opening night, and the private parties may be negotiable to work out a different day.  But the pickier you are on the day, the longer it may take to fit the Avenue's schedule.</p>
<p>The Mug Club:  In addition to the locally made mug and steeper keeper, you will get $1 off your teas for a year at the teahouse.  Additionally, we will have other perks available throughout the year, such as discounts on the menu and for special events, possibly even special events just for the Mug Club.</p>
<p>CSK pre-order:  This will simply lock you in for a CSK share, in case we need to cap the number we offer at first.  The money will be applied towards your CSK share total price.  For more details about the CSK, read our blog and/or see the 2nd to last question on our campaign FAQs.</p>
<p>Wall of supporters:  The wall of supporters will be a piece of art that will incorporate the names of contributors -- or their organization, or a memorial -- and will be hanging at the Avenue Cafe to show our appreciation for our community of supporters.  </p>
<p>Money towards food or tea ($100, $250 and $500 levels):  This will essentially be a gift card, so this will be good toward some good food &amp; tea at ""Abundance.""  This can not, however, be applied toward alcohol.</p>

Since we know how it is to be on a budget, we'll also have affordable options.       HerBlends of Plenty's Mission: To nurture community & connection with nature's plenty; for a more vital, resilient people, and a more verdant future.Embedded in the very core of our business is community.  We’re excited to be partnering with the Avenue Cafe not only because it’s a great location, but also because the Avenue has been a great space to meet with people, and to organize in the community.  With HerBlends of Plenty’s input, we will have it open for longer hours and we will engage with the community to host even more community events. We will work to find as many ways as possible to support our local economy, purchasing locally and creating partnerships with other local businesses and organizations.   We are invested in Lansing and in Michigan, and we will work hard to make it a  difference in our community.Our plans for the space at the Avenue Cafe, excerpted from our blog post (read the rest of this blog for more info!):  ""First, we'll transition the kitchen, focusing on creating farm-to-table friendly dine-in options -- we're thinking this will be around the end of May.  We suspect either the implementation of the fresh market, or the launch of the CSK (community supported kitchen) will come next.  The teahouse will come last, in July at the latest. Besides the challenge inherent in extending hours of operation -- which we will be doing -- we want to hold off on the teahouse until we're certain we have all of the herbs we will need to get rolling.  
We'll continue to create our own herbal tea blends, using local, sustainably grown ingredients, and we'll have those for sale at the teahouse.""From our blog, more details:

</div>
<div>Hi! </div>
<div>My name is Zaid, I am a 26 year old Latino entrepreneur in Kansas City. Over the past few years I have ridden the high seas through squalls and recently arrived at my destination, Pirate's Bone. This indiegogo and shop could not be possible without the help of my friends, the Crew. The Crew consist of friends like Lydia, Nadia, Emily, Christina, my brother Bogart and sister Ambar.  We can't forget about the rest; the Chai Shai crew and all of the great neighbors that believe in us everyday. In that note, I love you all. </div>
<div>Pirate's Bone is a small neighborhood coffee shop,  where with the spirit of Pirates we would like to sail the shop to success using creativity, passion, and craftsmanship. The community has been extremely supportive and in return we would like to repay them with more awesome coffee beans, tea and crazy mixed drinks.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<h3>What we need your support with...</h3>We need really good hearted and cool people like you!!! I swear!!! Mainly because you made it thus far, and we need the support from the community to acquire a commercial espresso machine, a coffee roaster, and some other nicknacks. We also need the money to fix up our back patio, which with your help shall be the nicest place to drink a great cup of coffee. With the funds we raise we will be able to purchase the <a href=""http://www.genecafe.com/swww/DBOARD/index.php?bbs_id=board3&amp;b_cate=@1000@1001&amp;cn=1183"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CBR 1200 Coffee Roaster</a>, that means we get to roast in house! Currently we have an espresso machine that we use for our day to day basis, but it's not meant to be used in a commercial setting. The new espresso machine doesn't have to be the Cadillac of espresso machines, we would definitely settle for a FIAT. <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1211399/files/20150210070931-fiat-jolly.jpg?1423580971"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
Kidding, but really; even a used ""commercial"" espresso machine for this place would be amazing! We wouldn't be able to afford a new machine with our goal, but we are beggars, not choosers.  An espresso machine with character, that is exactly what we are wanting for this space.  We could really keep on doing coffee the way we started, but everyone here deserves more! All of you have given so much support that we would like to contribute back with our skills. Giving you fresh roasted coffee, whether as beans or drip coffee. The same idea goes to having a commercial espresso machine; better service and appreciation. </div>

<h3> Our Green Promise </h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<p>We want to pledge to everyone our commitment to strive for better. Therefore, we will pinky promise to provide people with recycled and recyclable cups and lids. We've recently found out that most coffee cups out there, <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">including ours, cannot be recycled. It's a bummer and we need to change that! </span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1215436/files/20150211171123-home-recycle-symbol.gif?1423703483"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our Pour-Over/Tea/Drip filters will also be switched to more environmentally friendly filters. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We already recycle, but I feel the responsibility to strive for more and help other coffee shops see how it can be done. </span></p>

</div><div>
<div>...Try to picture this, as you pass through the back door you will be happily greeted with beautiful green vines wrapped around a long lived wooden trellis. The patio will be designed with a rustic harbor aesthetic. Wooden spools will be used as coffee tables accompanied by black metal chairs donated by <a href=""http://www.chaishaikc.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.chaishaikc.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chai Shai</a> and a handmade plush rustic bench. Once our indiegogo is successful, we will be able to make the back patio come to life.  In the evenings, our idea is to make the soft glow of mood lights hanging under the clear night sky allow you to fall even deeper in love with our space. </div>

<h3>What is the impact you say? .... You ask, we shall explain.</h3>
<div>Lets change the way we look at coffee shops. Lets make Pirate's Bone a place to get to know people, enjoy the company of other humans. Sounds so weird, right?  Lets not get caught up on anything in particular, but focus on what could make things better. We will continue to showcase local artists for free and with open arms. Because we all need a warm hug from local shops. Artists suffer! I used to be one, its hard to showcase your work. Some people don't care, or are simply just interested in showcasing well known artists. So, ""Second Fridays"" at Pirate's Bone will keep sailing! As always, we will showcase two Artists of any medium, one Musician or band, and one new Food-Truck every month. How awesome is that? REALLY AWESOME! We know. You have to see it to believe it. You'll understand the question about how many Pirates fit on a Pirate's Ship once you make it to a Second Friday event. </div>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>Risk ONE: We suck at making coffee drinks overnight, I guess it could happen; but not likely. Pirate's Bone will keep the same standard day to day. :)</div>
<div>Risk TWO: We end up being really bad at roasting on the new machine! That actually could happen, so keep your fingers crossed!!! Just kidding, we're pretty smart and like a challenge. The new machine will have problems keeping up with us! That's right. </div>
<div> Risk THREE: Indiegogo stated ""be transparent"".  What worries me is that I'm already transparent, maybe too much. </div>
<div><br/></div>

<p>Pirate's Bone </p>
</div></div>","Let us bring you a beautifully crafted cup of coffee. From the roasting to the brewing, our goal is to bring happiness by the cupful. 





Hi! 
My name is Zaid, I am a 26 year old Latino entrepreneur in Kansas City. Over the past few years I have ridden the high seas through squalls and recently arrived at my destination, Pirate's Bone. This indiegogo and shop could not be possible without the help of my friends, the Crew. The Crew consist of friends like Lydia, Nadia, Emily, Christina, my brother Bogart and sister Ambar.  We can't forget about the rest; the Chai Shai crew and all of the great neighbors that believe in us everyday. In that note, I love you all. 
Pirate's Bone is a small neighborhood coffee shop,  where with the spirit of Pirates we would like to sail the shop to success using creativity, passion, and craftsmanship. The community has been extremely supportive and in return we would like to repay them with more awesome coffee beans, tea and crazy mixed drinks.


What we need your support with...We need really good hearted and cool people like you!!! I swear!!! Mainly because you made it thus far, and we need the support from the community to acquire a commercial espresso machine, a coffee roaster, and some other nicknacks. We also need the money to fix up our back patio, which with your help shall be the nicest place to drink a great cup of coffee. With the funds we raise we will be able to purchase the CBR 1200 Coffee Roaster, that means we get to roast in house! Currently we have an espresso machine that we use for our day to day basis, but it's not meant to be used in a commercial setting. The new espresso machine doesn't have to be the Cadillac of espresso machines, we would definitely settle for a FIAT. 



Kidding, but really; even a used ""commercial"" espresso machine for this place would be amazing! We wouldn't be able to afford a new machine with our goal, but we are beggars, not choosers.  An espresso machine with character, that is exactly what we are wanting for this space.  We could really keep on doing coffee the way we started, but everyone here deserves more! All of you have given so much support that we would like to contribute back with our skills. Giving you fresh roasted coffee, whether as beans or drip coffee. The same idea goes to having a commercial espresso machine; better service and appreciation. 






 Our Green Promise 

We want to pledge to everyone our commitment to strive for better. Therefore, we will pinky promise to provide people with recycled and recyclable cups and lids. We've recently found out that most coffee cups out there, including ours, cannot be recycled. It's a bummer and we need to change that!  Our Pour-Over/Tea/Drip filters will also be switched to more environmentally friendly filters. We already recycle, but I feel the responsibility to strive for more and help other coffee shops see how it can be done. 



Green Thumbs Up  

...Try to picture this, as you pass through the back door you will be happily greeted with beautiful green vines wrapped around a long lived wooden trellis. The patio will be designed with a rustic harbor aesthetic. Wooden spools will be used as coffee tables accompanied by black metal chairs donated by Chai Shai and a handmade plush rustic bench. Once our indiegogo is successful, we will be able to make the back patio come to life.  In the evenings, our idea is to make the soft glow of mood lights hanging under the clear night sky allow you to fall even deeper in love with our space. 







What is the impact you say? .... You ask, we shall explain.
Lets change the way we look at coffee shops. Lets make Pirate's Bone a place to get to know people, enjoy the company of other humans. Sounds so weird, right?  Lets not get caught up on anything in particular, but focus on what could make things better. We will continue to showcase local artists for free and with open arms. Because we all need a warm hug from local shops. Artists suffer! I used to be one, its hard to showcase your work. Some people don't care, or are simply just interested in showcasing well known artists. So, ""Second Fridays"" at Pirate's Bone will keep sailing! As always, we will showcase two Artists of any medium, one Musician or band, and one new Food-Truck every month. How awesome is that? REALLY AWESOME! We know. You have to see it to believe it. You'll understand the question about how many Pirates fit on a Pirate's Ship once you make it to a Second Friday event.

Risks & Challenges
Risk ONE: We suck at making coffee drinks overnight, I guess it could happen; but not likely. Pirate's Bone will keep the same standard day to day. :)
Risk TWO: We end up being really bad at roasting on the new machine! That actually could happen, so keep your fingers crossed!!! Just kidding, we're pretty smart and like a challenge. The new machine will have problems keeping up with us! That's right. 
 Risk THREE: Indiegogo stated ""be transparent"".  What worries me is that I'm already transparent, maybe too much. 

Challenge ONE: We may pull more than 12 hour shifts, that would stink. They do say even the greatest get to suffer sometimes, so Pirates shall work. 

Challenge TWO: Getting more people from the community to know about us. Because we are a community coffee shop, we need to cater to all of Brookside/Morning Side/49-63rd.

is very extensive. It can be used for monitoring and protection of bicycles,

transported freight, construction and agricultural machinery, prams, luggage
and a number of other equipment.<br/>
Example: 1 – you are riding your bike or scooter and want to stop somewhere for
lunch. You place your bike in front of the restaurant and can rest assured, as
the application immediately alerts you if the bicycle is moved. In the event of
theft simply turn on the tracking (location detection) and contact, for

                  It's a Movement
 Rebecca is a poet, photographer, philosopher, and empathy builder.  She knew, when she wrote her first poetic short story for her Grandfather, that she wanted to devote her time to bringing empathy to more people through her short stories.Peace and Smiles is somewhat like Childrens' books ~ short, whimsical stories to brighten your day. Only they're meant for adults, and they can be personalized.
 Ready for production is a General Peace &Smiles short story for someone to read to their loved one who is in a nursing home or hospice.

The Peace and Smiles campaign is important to her, because there is an entire community of elderly people being forgotten. 
 Peace and Smiles begins with our wonderful elderly community, and it has the potential to expand much further, spreading empathetic connection to many people.  

We can help write vows, toasts, eulogies, dedications, etc.  What We Need

We need help spreading Peace and Smiles.  We need a dynamic Web Designer


Technology Systems Upgrades


Transportation needs 

Printed books of the General version to give to Hospices and Nursing Homes

What you will get: Perks
 We've included several different perks from photographs to short stories to show our appreciation!     The Impact 
In a world where we find much conflict and unease, Peace and Smiles creates connection by building bridges of empathy. 
 I met a woman for only a moment, whom I stayed in touch with via email. I wrote a Peace and Smiles short story for her to read to her husband who developed cancer. She told me ""he has a new will to live."" 


""The Important LITTLE things in life can be seen more clearly when we close our eyes and open our hearts."" ~~ Rebecca Koos

<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">We are Kirsten and Quincey, owners of Wanderlust Cafe in Bloomsburg, PA. Our cafe is a vegan, plant-based cafe serving healthy, delicious eats to locals, college students and travelers alike. Wanderlust Cafe is nearly two years old and we aspire to <b>take convenience to the next level</b>. We currently take time to prepare almost everything per each order in a cafe format. With so many people pressed for time but desperately wanting healthy options, we have decided to take many of our items to grab &amp; go status rather than full-service seating. <b>Our vision is to revolutionize the mini mart!</b> Oh yes!</span><br/>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">This will involve a slight rebranding:  <b>Wanderlust For Life</b></span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b><br/></b></span></div>
<div>

<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Where healthy food=NO wait</b> </span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>With help from our tribe (that's all of you), we envision optimal healthy options for our patrons and a more manageable workload for us. We do EVERYTHING ourselves. This whole venture has been a DIY project and we would like to be able to take some vacations from time to time, being the nature-loving, treehugging wanderlust addicted misfit toys that we are. Our complex recipes and time intensive preparation has prevented us from being able to step away...and if we do, we must close for that to happen. <b>This changes everything!</b><br/><br/>We will continue making our legendary smoothies fresh at the time of order and have soups hot and ready! We will also make sure that all of the sandwiches and other items on the menu that our customers love can be made using our creations. <b>We don't want anyone to be lost without our Gyspy spread, after all! </b>From our hummus selection, homemade pizza/spaghetti sauce and unique tofeta, to our juices and non-dairy mylks, it will all be available! Oh, and the kale chips.  <b>The kale chips!</b><br/><br/><b>What else will we have?</b><br/><br/>Don't worry, we didn't forget about the Spring rolls! We'll also be adding pre-made salads like lovely massaged kale salads, potato salad, fresh greens salads and more. We've got ya covered with the sweet stuff too, the chia pudding and vagabond bars...plus more new creations! Speaking of new creations:  can we just say vegan sushi rolls!?!<br/><br/>The bottom line is this:<br/><br/><b>Farm to our kitchen to your destination!</b><br/><br/>There's no room for additives and unnatural ingredients in our creations. They're too <b>naturally</b> flavorful for all that nonsense! Whole foods for the win!</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We are passionate about real food. Food that hasn't been modified or sprayed. Food with the nutrients that our bodies so deeply crave! And we sure know our way around the kitchen!</span></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">We haven't always been this way. Both of us have consumed that sad, standard American diet for most of our lives. Then we made gradual changes. Then huge shifts. Our goal is to help others do the same, assist with healthy travels (whether it is one mile or a thousand) and educate at the same time.<br/></span><br/><b>Your contributions will be key in that big picture! The only way to change the World is to BE that change you wish to see.  Even better to do it together as a community!</b>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b><h3>So...where will your money go?</h3></b></div>
<div>This change means we need to bring on some additional help and purchase display refrigerators, more dehydrators, another high-speed blender, another juicer, huge stocks of ingredient inventory, labels, to-go containers and glass jars and lids for our juices, mylks, teas, infused waters, etc...</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We already use compostable takeout containers and will continue to do the best that we possibly can with sustainable business practices. This is of utmost importance to us!</span></div>

We are Kirsten and Quincey, owners of Wanderlust Cafe in Bloomsburg, PA. Our cafe is a vegan, plant-based cafe serving healthy, delicious eats to locals, college students and travelers alike. Wanderlust Cafe is nearly two years old and we aspire to take convenience to the next level. We currently take time to prepare almost everything per each order in a cafe format. With so many people pressed for time but desperately wanting healthy options, we have decided to take many of our items to grab & go status rather than full-service seating. Our vision is to revolutionize the mini mart! Oh yes!


This will involve a slight rebranding:  Wanderlust For Life


Nourishment no matter what direction you're heading.


Where healthy food=NO wait 

With help from our tribe (that's all of you), we envision optimal healthy options for our patrons and a more manageable workload for us. We do EVERYTHING ourselves. This whole venture has been a DIY project and we would like to be able to take some vacations from time to time, being the nature-loving, treehugging wanderlust addicted misfit toys that we are. Our complex recipes and time intensive preparation has prevented us from being able to step away...and if we do, we must close for that to happen. This changes everything!We will continue making our legendary smoothies fresh at the time of order and have soups hot and ready! We will also make sure that all of the sandwiches and other items on the menu that our customers love can be made using our creations. We don't want anyone to be lost without our Gyspy spread, after all! From our hummus selection, homemade pizza/spaghetti sauce and unique tofeta, to our juices and non-dairy mylks, it will all be available! Oh, and the kale chips.  The kale chips!What else will we have?Don't worry, we didn't forget about the Spring rolls! We'll also be adding pre-made salads like lovely massaged kale salads, potato salad, fresh greens salads and more. We've got ya covered with the sweet stuff too, the chia pudding and vagabond bars...plus more new creations! Speaking of new creations:  can we just say vegan sushi rolls!?!The bottom line is this:Farm to our kitchen to your destination!There's no room for additives and unnatural ingredients in our creations. They're too naturally flavorful for all that nonsense! Whole foods for the win!
We are passionate about real food. Food that hasn't been modified or sprayed. Food with the nutrients that our bodies so deeply crave! And we sure know our way around the kitchen!

We haven't always been this way. Both of us have consumed that sad, standard American diet for most of our lives. Then we made gradual changes. Then huge shifts. Our goal is to help others do the same, assist with healthy travels (whether it is one mile or a thousand) and educate at the same time.Your contributions will be key in that big picture! The only way to change the World is to BE that change you wish to see.  Even better to do it together as a community!


So...where will your money go?
This change means we need to bring on some additional help and purchase display refrigerators, more dehydrators, another high-speed blender, another juicer, huge stocks of ingredient inventory, labels, to-go containers and glass jars and lids for our juices, mylks, teas, infused waters, etc...
We already use compostable takeout containers and will continue to do the best that we possibly can with sustainable business practices. This is of utmost importance to us!
The funds we receive will cover all of our needs and if we aren't fully funded with our $11,111 goal, our intention is to use what we get to proceed with the plan but with some adaptations and gradual inventory purchases rather than massive ones.Our perks are simply amazing! Did we mention that Kirsten is also an author??? Take a look at them and know that our dream is to do well while doing good. We hope you can find it in your heart to help us in this passionate endeavor!

Of course, there will be challenges!

The one big thing about challenges, though:  WE LOVE THEM! We built this business. We don't know the meaning of ""can't"" and we never walk away defeated! The thing about life is that it is meant to be an ever-evolving lesson and we dig every single breath we take! Obstacles are meant to be crushed...much like our juicer crushes apples!


Don't have extra funds but really wanna help?

 You know what? We understand that. We've been there. A lot!
You can still be a huge part of this!  How?

Eventually, Punch Taverns will turn it into a backpackers hostel, but whilst planning permission goes through, it is being run by a collective of creatives keen to make it a successful venture.Serving coffees, craft beers and unique cocktails, the artistic vibe, pool table and chilled out tunes make it a great place to go for a drink. However, the key incentive of the space is to offer free workshop, rehearsal, exhibition and performance space to whoever would like to use it. All that we ask in return is that drinks are brought over the bar and a donation is made to the running costs of the building. We at The Fleeting Arms believe that a creative community thrives when it has open access to free space. Removing or reducing the financial risk for artists, musicians and performers can help foster creative risk, boldness of expression and innovation of ideas. In return for using the space, we ask that every company, group, or artist donates a cash sum in return. The person who makes the booking takes responsibility for making this donation. We don't set out fixed fees as we feel that this could become discriminatory, and we understand that each project, group or artist will be operating under completely different financial circumstances according to many differing factors. There is one rule: Please Be As Generous As You Can. Look into your hearts and give what makes you feel good. The venue will only continue to be a success if we as a community pull together and all get behind it, and continue to put in as much as we take out of its resources.Your donation can be given in two ways:·         Pay a donation online here.·         Pay a cash amount over the bar on the day of your rehearsal, performance, or workshop booking.The donations we receive will go into covering the running costs of the building, and help us keep this project going for the creative community of York and will help us to nurture the vast wealth of talent and creativity in our city.

</p>
<p>My name is Nicole. I am retired from the Wisconsin Army
National Guard after 20-1/2 years of honorable service, a disabled Veteran, a
full time student at Concordia University seeking a Bachelor’s Degree in
Business Management, unemployed, and a single mother of three wonderful children.
I served in a combat zone during Operation Iraqi Freedom from 2009-2010. </p>
<p>My dream to open a coffee shop began while serving soldiers
and contractors specialty coffee and drinks through the Chaplain’s ministry during
my tour on Camp Taji, Iraq in 2009. I volunteered approximately 240 hours after
duty hours for the Chaplain’s Ministry coffee house.</p>
<p>The coffee shop on Camp Taji was a place of respite for
many.  It was a home away from home; a
place to relax and let your hair down after a long, hot day of work. People of
different ages, faiths, and backgrounds gathered to converse, play, and
unwind.  Ever since I have left Camp
Taji, I have been on a quest to recreate that type of coffee house atmosphere
here in the U.S.</p>
<p>Recently, I shared my vision with my friend Dennis. Dennis
is this funny, compassionate, single father with a dream of becoming a business
owner one day. After listening to the plans, he believed in me, in the vision, and
decided he would like to form a partnership to make my dream come true.</p>
<br/> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>We have a location. The building is located in an industrial
area on a busy street off the expressway. It is big enough to accommodate all
of the activities we can offer: volleyball court, horseshoe pit, video gaming
area, movie viewing area, study area, outdoor lounging areas, and Wi-Fi. We
would offer a simple food menu and other beverages besides coffee. The living
space attached, along with the coffee shop, would be available for rent.</p>
<p>Currently we are in the process of forming partnerships with
people to offer their one-of-kind products and services through our business. The
logo is being designed. We are in the process of registering our business name.
We will begin to roast coffee and make merchandise with the company name and
logo available late summer for purchase.</p>
<p>This is where we need your help. Our goal is to raise
$190,000 for the purchase of the building. We are seeking 190,000 people to volunteer
a minimum donation of $1. In return, we will offer an incentive program for
your help and donation. These are the following incentives:</p>
<p><u>Incentive #1</u>- All donors will have their name
displayed on the premise as a way to recognize the people   who
made the opening of the coffee house happen <b>PLUS</b> receive regular updates as how the coffee house is
progressing. </p>
<p><u>Incentive #2</u>- All donors who give $1-$100 will receive
½ off their first purchase of any food, beverage, or merchandise in store or
online.</p>
<p><u>Incentive #3</u>-All donors who give $101-$400 will receive
½ off their first purchase of any food, beverage, or merchandise in store or
online <b>PLUS </b>a 5% discount on all
additional purchases thereafter.</p>
<p><u>Incentive #4</u>- All donors who give $401-$1000 will receive
½ off their first purchase of any food, beverage, or merchandise in store or
online <b>PLUS </b>a 10% discount on all
additional purchases thereafter.</p>
<p><u>Incentive #5</u>-All donors who give $1001 and up will receive
½ off their first purchase of any food, beverage, or merchandise in store or
online <b>PLUS </b>a 15% discount on all
additional purchases thereafter.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>We are excited for the chance for our business to make an impact in communities and on people in the City of Milwaukee. </p>
<p>We want to create jobs for the most vulnerable; jump start other people's dreams and visions for business ownership and opportunities; and help under-served  children and parents with  resources to help ease situations (example: buy clothes, shoes, school supplies, hats, mittens, books for inner city children, etc.).</p>
<p>We want to take a ""pay it forward"" approach in our business along with providing an alcohol free, fun, and comfortable environment for every age.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Currently our challenges are going to be remodeling and setting ourselves apart from other businesses such as McDonald's, Dunkin Donuts, and  Starbucks.</p>
<p>Our goal is to provide healthier and less expensive products than competitors in the area. Our customers will love the customer service and environment that we will create. Making it comfortable and economical is our main goal</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you cannot contribute to our campaign, we will totally understand. I am an unemployed Veteran and a full time student so I understand how tight finances can be. What you can do for us is spread the word and share our campaign with your friends and families. That would be most appreciated!</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are humbled and honored for even considering a donation
that will help our dream to own a coffee house come to fruition. </p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

My dream to open a coffee shop began while serving soldiers
and contractors specialty coffee and drinks through the Chaplain’s ministry during
my tour on Camp Taji, Iraq in 2009. I volunteered approximately 240 hours after
duty hours for the Chaplain’s Ministry coffee house.
The coffee shop on Camp Taji was a place of respite for
many.  It was a home away from home; a
place to relax and let your hair down after a long, hot day of work. People of
different ages, faiths, and backgrounds gathered to converse, play, and
unwind.  Ever since I have left Camp
Taji, I have been on a quest to recreate that type of coffee house atmosphere
here in the U.S.
Recently, I shared my vision with my friend Dennis. Dennis
is this funny, compassionate, single father with a dream of becoming a business
owner one day. After listening to the plans, he believed in me, in the vision, and
decided he would like to form a partnership to make my dream come true.
   What We Need & What You Get 
We have a location. The building is located in an industrial
area on a busy street off the expressway. It is big enough to accommodate all
of the activities we can offer: volleyball court, horseshoe pit, video gaming
area, movie viewing area, study area, outdoor lounging areas, and Wi-Fi. We
would offer a simple food menu and other beverages besides coffee. The living
space attached, along with the coffee shop, would be available for rent.
Currently we are in the process of forming partnerships with
people to offer their one-of-kind products and services through our business. The
logo is being designed. We are in the process of registering our business name.
We will begin to roast coffee and make merchandise with the company name and
logo available late summer for purchase.
This is where we need your help. Our goal is to raise
$190,000 for the purchase of the building. We are seeking 190,000 people to volunteer
a minimum donation of $1. In return, we will offer an incentive program for
your help and donation. These are the following incentives:
Incentive #1- All donors will have their name
displayed on the premise as a way to recognize the people   who
made the opening of the coffee house happen PLUS receive regular updates as how the coffee house is
progressing. 
Incentive #2- All donors who give $1-$100 will receive
½ off their first purchase of any food, beverage, or merchandise in store or
online.
Incentive #3-All donors who give $101-$400 will receive
½ off their first purchase of any food, beverage, or merchandise in store or
online PLUS a 5% discount on all
additional purchases thereafter.
Incentive #4- All donors who give $401-$1000 will receive
½ off their first purchase of any food, beverage, or merchandise in store or
online PLUS a 10% discount on all
additional purchases thereafter.
Incentive #5-All donors who give $1001 and up will receive
½ off their first purchase of any food, beverage, or merchandise in store or
online PLUS a 15% discount on all
additional purchases thereafter.

The Impact We are excited for the chance for our business to make an impact in communities and on people in the City of Milwaukee. 
We want to create jobs for the most vulnerable; jump start other people's dreams and visions for business ownership and opportunities; and help under-served  children and parents with  resources to help ease situations (example: buy clothes, shoes, school supplies, hats, mittens, books for inner city children, etc.).
We want to take a ""pay it forward"" approach in our business along with providing an alcohol free, fun, and comfortable environment for every age.
    Risks & Challenges Currently our challenges are going to be remodeling and setting ourselves apart from other businesses such as McDonald's, Dunkin Donuts, and  Starbucks.
Our goal is to provide healthier and less expensive products than competitors in the area. Our customers will love the customer service and environment that we will create. Making it comfortable and economical is our main goal
    Other Ways You Can Help If you cannot contribute to our campaign, we will totally understand. I am an unemployed Veteran and a full time student so I understand how tight finances can be. What you can do for us is spread the word and share our campaign with your friends and families. That would be most appreciated!

We are humbled and honored for even considering a donation
that will help our dream to own a coffee house come to fruition. 
Thank you!

I have graduated from European University in Switzerland with a BBA in Business Administration and MBA in International Business. </p>
<p>I am trying my best to develop my first personal project. I have been living here for 3 years now and I have developed a broad network of influential friends. I also have some support from my family.</p>
<p>My idea is to develop a snake farm for venom extraction, with my company being Venomach™. The global demand for snake venom currently exceeds the supply available, primarily because there is a constantly growing need for anti-venom and research. This market is still growing and flourishing.</p>
<p>However, it is not an easy task to accomplish as there are several strict legislations, regulations, risks and conditions that have to be met/overcome in order to successfully establish such a facility.</p>
<p>Most sincerely and honestly, I currently don't have any funds at my disposal for such a project and the project is at its earliest stage of being simply an idea. However I do not want to miss such an opportunity as I know I have the required network of contacts that can assist me and can grant me the necessary authorisations and general support.</p>
<p>Your contribution is the only source of financial support at the moment and would allow me to at least start the project promptly and seriously.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>The capital needed for such a project is unfortunately not small, preferably minimum $200,000 USD. If I won't be able to reach my target, whatever I can accumulate will be spent on starting, or if possible, completing some of the essential requirements step by step. These steps include some of the following:</p> <ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Acquisition and purchase of all licenses</span><br/>
</li>
<li>Company setup/registration costs</li>
<li>Land rent for the location of the facility</li>
<li>Light construction to create an indoor facility with heating and lighting which is essential to create the appropriate environment for the snakes</li>
<li>Equipments; terrariums, lab tools, fridges, protective gears, emergency equipment, security equipment, etc.</li>
<li>Hiring a team of minimum 4 staff</li>
<li>Finding and hiring the right experts to train the staff</li>
<li>Searching for a supplier of snakes in Africa or Asia, then purchasing and importing the snakes</li>
</ul>
<div>It is very important to create the right conditions and environment for animals such as snakes as they are sensitive to temperature changes and captive conditions. One of the major goals of the company will be to make sure that the environment is both comfortable and safe for both the animals and the staff, hence the reason why the above points are essential and costly.<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>There are obviously other extra expenses in between and during some of these objectives, but I don't think it is necessary to explain every detail as it would take too long, I hope these few points make it as clear as possible.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The major advantage that I have is having a close cousin who is familiar with this business as he has some experience. I also have a close friend/business associate who has a construction company therefore the costs for the facility will be as low as possible. Considering that the project is going to be in Turkey, it makes it easier to negotiate and bargain with everyone (even the authorities) since it is a cultural aspect of daily life and thus also in business.</div> </div> <div> <h3>Rewards</h3> <p>Good cause and ethics ought to be the key factors in developing and driving every project into existence.

<p>There is great potential in researching snake venom and even other forms of venom from different species. Already certain medications and substances require the production and constant supply of snake venom and more is needed for research.</p>

I want to get Buddycup in the hands of everyone who likes to shop while pushing a cart and enjoy their beverage stress free. With you help, Buddycup will become a household name. Beverage Kiosks in Grocery and Department stores will also benefit.  Remember, keep it concise, yet personal. Ask yourself: if someone stopped reading here would they be ready to make a contribution?   What We Need & What You Get  The $25,000 will help get the mold created and to get started with manufacturing 1,000 units. Money needs to fund an art department for the packaging layout. Also, to get my website established.
 What about a personal To-Go cup with the Buddycup logo? Tee shirts are also to be available.
 If the goal is not met the funds received will go to the mold and manufacturing.
    The Impact  Buddycup will get more consumers on board to enjoy a to-go cup beverage while shopping with a cart.
 I have an armful of completed surveys from people I don't even know praising Buddycup and cannot wait until it is available.
 This project took under two years to evolve. I constantly went out testing all kinds of shopping carts with my models and going back to the shop to make it better. You will not be disappointed when using Buddycup.
    Risks & Challenges  Of course starting up manufacturing can be a bumpy road. Samples must be measured and tested.Quality Control will be ongoing.
 Visiting the manufacturer and being hands on with the development is key to success.
    Other Ways You Can Help  If you can't contribute, no problem, please, I ask you to spread the word to all you friends and relatives. Together we can revolutionize our shopping habits.

Eliminar la discriminación, social y legislativa, que sufrimos las personas homosexuales, bisexuales y transexuales.

Y esto...sigue siendo necesario? Estamos convencidas de que sí. Por que sigue habiendo discriminación laboral de las personas transexuales, por que un 17% de lxs jóvenes LGTB confiesan que se ha intentado suicidar debido a su orientación, por que quieren excluir a las parejas de mujeres de la reproducción asistida por la sanidad pública diferenciándolas así de parejas heteros, por que sigue habiendo tribunales que legislan discriminando hasta nuestra sangre, por que ser gay, lesbiana, bisexual o transexual sigue estándo perseguido y duramente castigado en muchos países y en España somos el colectivo que sufrimos más delitos de odio....y un largo etcétera que queremos acortar.Pero sabemos que para construir una sociedad igualitaria, real y duradera, los cimientos deben ser sólidos y esto solo lo conseguiremos con el apoyo y la concienciación de todas y todos!

Para ello, organizamos en Vigo una Semana Cultural del Orgullo LGTBI donde compartir nuestras inquietudes con toda la ciudadanía, implicando, desde peques a mayores, en la construcción de una ciudad igualitaria con la Diversidad sexual y de género.

<p>We can make that happen and need your support and funding for a #survey #tech project. In return we are providing leadership and training perks for small business owners, HR directors, managers and companies desiring more cooperation between among employees and collaboration between departments.<br/></p>
<p> The solution is our 360 Team Behavior Survey, which takes all the  guess work out of how to support and improve teams and their leaders. The TIGERS survey measures six principles that transform adequate teams into exceptional ones. The six principles  are trust, interdependence, genuineness, empathy, risk (resolution), and success. They form the acronym TIGERS. <br/></p>
<p>The 6 Principles are anchored by behaviors that make common sense to everyone. The solution helps business leaders track improvements through cost savings and improved productivity.  The bottom line, however, is happier and more productive organizations.<br/></p>
<p></p>

<b><h3>Our goal is $2000.  <br/>

</h3>
</div><div>
<p></p>
<p>We know that work cultures that attract and retain employees are just as important as 
individual department teams when cooperation among employees is critical for business success.  So instead of offering a company wide survey and multiple department surveys, we would like to consolidate it into one survey.  This makes training and development more effective, less time-wasting and less confusing.<br/></p>
<b><h3>Take a look at our perk levels<br/>
</h3></b><p><b>Our turn-around for perks is within one business day. <br/></b></p>
<p>Check out our perk descriptions and videos below for more complete details. The team consultant who invested in the team survey just received some stellar information to support her client -- a client with the desire to be one of the best companies to work for in their region. So we will continue to support your investment even beyond the end of this campaign. </p>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3></b><p></p>Before we put the survey on the internet, we used a pen and paper version for team improvement.  <br/><br/>Some of these companies are<i> now</i>  known as best places to work, have low turnover, very successful employees and leaders who have achieved national and international recognition. <br/><br/>Because the survey and anchored behaviors make such good common sense, it isn't hard to achieve these results. And the impact carries over into families and stronger more vibrant communities because businesses are more stable and successful. <br/>
</div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445275432/nv9dhtzixfw3jmu6fgl0.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Our vision is much larger than just ""<i>what's in it for us</i>"".<br/><br/>The trickle down effect of a positive work environment that employees 
look forward to returning to after a couple of days off reduces 
workplace conflict that employees take home with them, By helping us 
fund the next level of this survey you can help us put more positive 
resources in the hands of leaders who can make a difference, leaving the
 workplace and our communities in better shape. <br/><br/>If you know HR Directors, Consultants and Coaches that work with business and not-for-profit teams, we plan to teach them to use this resource, too.  We are making this resource open for others to use.  <br/><br/>We also designed
 this campaign so that the 2-4 funding levels actually 
give you the perks below it as bonuses to keep or share with others over the 
holidays. These are resources that managers, leaders and entrepreneurs 
can use immediately to improve their own business results. <br/><div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> Much of what is necessary to take the survey to the next level has already been  tested.  We also plan to release the updated BETA version to people who fund  the survey level perk.  We are supplying technical support for the survey now and you can start a department survey or 8 or more people right away. <br/></p>

</div></div>","If your employees experienced less conflict and built better working relationships would this be a happier and more productive workplace with improved business revenue? 
We can make that happen and need your support and funding for a #survey #tech project. In return we are providing leadership and training perks for small business owners, HR directors, managers and companies desiring more cooperation between among employees and collaboration between departments.
 The solution is our 360 Team Behavior Survey, which takes all the  guess work out of how to support and improve teams and their leaders. The TIGERS survey measures six principles that transform adequate teams into exceptional ones. The six principles  are trust, interdependence, genuineness, empathy, risk (resolution), and success. They form the acronym TIGERS. 
The 6 Principles are anchored by behaviors that make common sense to everyone. The solution helps business leaders track improvements through cost savings and improved productivity.  The bottom line, however, is happier and more productive organizations.


Our goal is $2000.  




We know that work cultures that attract and retain employees are just as important as 
individual department teams when cooperation among employees is critical for business success.  So instead of offering a company wide survey and multiple department surveys, we would like to consolidate it into one survey.  This makes training and development more effective, less time-wasting and less confusing.
Take a look at our perk levels
Our turn-around for perks is within one business day. 
Check out our perk descriptions and videos below for more complete details. The team consultant who invested in the team survey just received some stellar information to support her client -- a client with the desire to be one of the best companies to work for in their region. So we will continue to support your investment even beyond the end of this campaign. 
Here's the perks!
$15 The Book TIGERS Among us showcasing successful businesses with 10 - 1800 employees.  Tips, strategies, examples and team meeting questions to take your organization up a notch in 2016


$30 Melting Your Stress Within 30 Days - Stress Mastery Home Study Course. 
We were asked by a contact to include this.  So we did.  So, if your peeps are suffering from sleepless nights, turmoil and that feeling of being trapped between a rock and a hard spot, this gift from you will be appreciated for a life-time. 
Melting Your Stress Within 30 Days Melting Your Stress will teach you how 
to holistically recover from burnout, tackle daily challenges, develop a
 winning mindset, and realize all your goals. Not merely theory or good 
ideas, this home study program provides you with the timeless 
strategies, exercises and surveys used by myself as well as some of the 
greatest and successful trainers and leaders today. Taken together and 
implemented every day, these stress management principles will transform
 you, your job and your relationships so that you are able to achieve 
what you deserve in life. Includes Study Guide, audio training support and more. 
$30 Engaging Employee To Champion Change Audio and E-book Training Program.
If you know that something needs to change in your business so that you are more productive and successful, check out this perk.  It shows you the most important considerations for change so you don't waste time, money and your reputation.



$50 Webinar: Avoid 3 Serious Mistakes That Cause Collaboration and High Performance Teamwork to Fail  - This level also includes the first and second perks, too, as bonuses.
This webinar is HRCI recognized.  What does that mean?  It means that a HR certification company reviewed this material and gave it a gold star. No sales pitch webinar here.  Just darn good information that will keep leaders from investing in training that fails to transfer to improved skills and attitudes. 

$100 6 Principles On-line Leadership Training - This level also includes level one, two and three perks as bonuses.If you are a manager or supervisor and want to learn some very important team leadership skills on your own because you have the goal to advance your career, don't pass this one up.  The bonuses give you the book, the change program and this tool, too.
$250 The TIGERS Team Survey which includes premium support for groups of 8 - 150 people.  It also includes a free version of the comprehensive survey.
We help you run this survey for your team or small company. So don't think for one minute that you are on your own with this.  And we debrief the results with you.  So if you have the goal of improving your team or company but don't know where to start, this survey gives you both direction and insight for strategic results. 


$800 On Line Team Facilitation Training. This includes the TIGERS Team Wheel Team Building Activity and effective Team Consensus facilitation for leaders, project managers, business owners, coaches and trainers. This level also includes level one, two, three and four perks as bonuses.
This is step one in the TIGERS licensing process.  It is available any time but not at this investment after 12/11.  


$1000 Full Day Leadership Retreat. We will facilitate a full day, customized TIGERS leadership retreat for your company or organization.  Your team will learn the behaviors that build strong teams and behaviors that cause problems. 
Then we will facilitate your next steps so your entire team is on the same page with the same agreements. (Travel expenses are additional).

 
$2000 Two Day Leadership Team Development Problem Solving Clinic. We will facilitate a customized 2-day, clinic to help your leaders build cross functional teams for important company-wide problem solving or system development projects. 
This clinic helps you develop team charters with behavior expectations with planning outcomes. (Travel expenses are additional).




The ImpactBefore we put the survey on the internet, we used a pen and paper version for team improvement.  Some of these companies are now  known as best places to work, have low turnover, very successful employees and leaders who have achieved national and international recognition. Because the survey and anchored behaviors make such good common sense, it isn't hard to achieve these results. And the impact carries over into families and stronger more vibrant communities because businesses are more stable and successful. 
Our vision is much larger than just ""what's in it for us"".The trickle down effect of a positive work environment that employees 
look forward to returning to after a couple of days off reduces 
workplace conflict that employees take home with them, By helping us 
fund the next level of this survey you can help us put more positive 
resources in the hands of leaders who can make a difference, leaving the
 workplace and our communities in better shape. If you know HR Directors, Consultants and Coaches that work with business and not-for-profit teams, we plan to teach them to use this resource, too.  We are making this resource open for others to use.  We also designed
 this campaign so that the 2-4 funding levels actually 
give you the perks below it as bonuses to keep or share with others over the 
holidays. These are resources that managers, leaders and entrepreneurs 
can use immediately to improve their own business results.  
Risks & Challenges  Much of what is necessary to take the survey to the next level has already been  tested.  We also plan to release the updated BETA version to people who fund  the survey level perk.  We are supplying technical support for the survey now and you can start a department survey or 8 or more people right away.

<p>We are establishing a non-profit organisation in Kapan,
Armenia to build several environmental initiatives in the region as well as to
act as a centre for ecotourism.</p>
<p><b>First

<p>We have successfully achieved the project’s first phase; the
establishment of our eco-camp which will serve the local community as well as visiting
tourists, volunteers and nature lovers who wish to contribute to our project.
This is the first such camp in the region and we have also launched a project
website and Facebook page to promote our activities.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430659956/ok4hx9d4mmseo41outdi.jpg"" src=""""/></p><b>Phase
Two: Hiking Trail Network</b><br/><br/>Our next goal is to establish a network of sustainable
hiking trails around Kapan. These hiking trails will give visiting tourists
access to the ecological, cultural and historical riches of the region while
stimulating the local economy with the creation of an alternative industry. Additionally,
we hope to encourage the local community to connect with the land through these
trails and instill pride and desire to protect their natural environment. The
network will also facilitate conservationists and biologists to monitor and
study the surrounding ecosystems. The establishment of the hiking trail network
will involve designing and mapping routes, signage, trail maintenance and
producing printed maps. To achieve this we will enlist the help of volunteers,
both local and international.<br/><br/><p>With both aspects complete, we will be able to attract
people from all over the world to take part in low-cost ecotourism in southern
Armenia. Not only will this help create new sustainable economic activity but
it will also improve Armenia’s profile and attract even more tourists to the
regions and villages of Syunik.</p>

We are establishing a non-profit organisation in Kapan,
Armenia to build several environmental initiatives in the region as well as to
act as a centre for ecotourism.
First
Success: ARK camp
We have successfully achieved the project’s first phase; the
establishment of our eco-camp which will serve the local community as well as visiting
tourists, volunteers and nature lovers who wish to contribute to our project.
This is the first such camp in the region and we have also launched a project
website and Facebook page to promote our activities.Phase
Two: Hiking Trail NetworkOur next goal is to establish a network of sustainable
hiking trails around Kapan. These hiking trails will give visiting tourists
access to the ecological, cultural and historical riches of the region while
stimulating the local economy with the creation of an alternative industry. Additionally,
we hope to encourage the local community to connect with the land through these
trails and instill pride and desire to protect their natural environment. The
network will also facilitate conservationists and biologists to monitor and
study the surrounding ecosystems. The establishment of the hiking trail network
will involve designing and mapping routes, signage, trail maintenance and
producing printed maps. To achieve this we will enlist the help of volunteers,
both local and international.With both aspects complete, we will be able to attract
people from all over the world to take part in low-cost ecotourism in southern
Armenia. Not only will this help create new sustainable economic activity but
it will also improve Armenia’s profile and attract even more tourists to the
regions and villages of Syunik.
What We Need

with a breakdown of costs as follows;

</div></div>","Help us Rebuild the Lives of Nepal's Earthquake Victims!!The terrible earthquake in Nepal has devastated an entire country.  Homes have crumbled to the ground.  Roads have become impassable.  Entire villages have no access to food, shelter, water or medicine.The numbers are staggering; thousands and thousands of people killed, tens of thousands more injured, and hundreds of thousands of homes destroyed.  Nearly 1 million children now lack access to basic needs and 8 million people’s lives are impacted by this tragedy, so far.  Nepal is one of the homelands of the yogic tradition, and its time to take care of the people whose culture has so richly nourished ours. The Sat Nam Foundation is funding groups on the ground bringing supplies and support to the hardest hit areas of Nepal.We are working with our friends at Ramana’s Garden Children’s Home, the site of our last Seva project, who are organizing tents and supplies to be hiked in to some of the most remote regions where aid isn’t already getting in.  We are also working with The Divine Shakti Foundation, headed by leaders of Parmarth Niketan Ashram in Rishikesh, India, who are organizing large truckloads to take desperately needed aid into Nepal.They are sending food, tents, lanterns, blankets, clothing, insect repellent and medical supplies.  Lives are being saved with each  delivery.



It is people like us who must step up now and serve.  We can help prevent the second wave of disasters…the aftermath of the earthquake brings disease, poverty, and violence.
Sat Nam Foundation has created a new album called “Kirtan Aid Live: Nepal Earthquake Relief” to raise money for these incredible projects in Nepal.  Join Snatam Kaur, Deva Premal & Miten, Ajeet Kaur, Mirabai Ceiba, Ashana, Aykanna, Shantala, Sirgun Kaur, Donna De Lory, Jaya Lakshmi & Ananda, Nirinjan Kaur, Krishna Kaur, Luna Ray, Dave Stringer, Harnam, Gurutrang Singh, GuruGanesha Band, Paloma Devi and Jai-Jagdeesh.  We are yogis changing the world.  Let’s be the light houses that we were born to be.
Please donate today.  You can provide a blanket for a child or send food, shelter, clothing and medicine for an entire village.  


It is in these times that we are called upon as yogis to step forward and give.  
Seva is the yoga of service.  As yogis, we must practice this important form of yoga.

Please join us now and show the world that yogis are here to serve!
DONATE NOW!You can give just $5 to supply a meals for an entire day.  Or you can give $250 and feed 100 people for a day.  You can sponsor an entire truck load of supplies for just $1600.  


About Sat Nam Foundation:
Sat Nam Foundation was created to serve.  Seva (service) is one of the fundamental practices of a yogic lifestyle.  We believe that it is our duty as yogis to serve.
The owners, employees, artists and teachers of Spirit Voyage and Sat Nam Fest banded together to create Sat Nam Foundation to manifest our mission of yogisserving those in need through yoga and music.
We invite you to join us. Jump on board.

<p><strong>WHAT DRIVES US?</strong> </p>
</div><div>Our vision is to build a strong community of enthusiastic members within the first 18 months after the initial launch. As we grow, more people will discover the value of our solution and will maintain support of the vision. As a reward we will  host a random monthly drawing of up to $5000  to be paid by <a href=""http://www.thevillageinitiative.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Village Initiative</a> to assist members with their student loan debt.<strong><br/><br/>WHY WE NEED YOU?</strong>
</div><div>We need your help to continue developing our platform over the next 6-12 months. We have personally funded the concept thus far with our own money. Our platform relies heavily on having the best utilities and front-end development to achieve our goals for launch. We need your help for the following:</div><div>
<br/><strong>Development costs-</strong><strong>$5,000</strong><br/>(Includes advanced network security, legal and API protocols, licenses for third-party plug-ins and development of educational software)<br/><strong>Marketing- $5,000</strong><br/>(Including multiple launch events, college campus tour, social media impressions, promotion literature)<br/><br/>
</div><p><u>Once our platform is fully developed, the process to join will be simple:</u><br/>1. Visit the website <a href=""http://www.thevillageinitiative.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>www.thevillageinitiative.com</u></a>.<br/>2. Create your profile to join the village.<br/>3. Create a campaign explaining your collegiate journey and funding goals.<br/>4. Share your campaign with your personal village.<br/>5. After your campaign is completed forward your contributions to your lender.<strong><br/><br/>TOGETHER WE CAN BE CATALYSTS IN THE FIGHT!!</strong></p><div>

</div><p>The reason The Village Initiative will become successful is due to being a greed-free venture and having social responsibility built into each facet of our business.

</div></div>","Finally, a solution to deflate the student loan bubble!

Our goal is to eradicate education debt through our unique crowdfunding platform...but first, we need your support to create 
The Village Initiative!
WHAT DRIVES US? 
Our vision is to build a strong community of enthusiastic members within the first 18 months after the initial launch. As we grow, more people will discover the value of our solution and will maintain support of the vision. As a reward we will  host a random monthly drawing of up to $5000  to be paid by The Village Initiative to assist members with their student loan debt.WHY WE NEED YOU?
We need your help to continue developing our platform over the next 6-12 months. We have personally funded the concept thus far with our own money. Our platform relies heavily on having the best utilities and front-end development to achieve our goals for launch. We need your help for the following:
Development costs-$5,000(Includes advanced network security, legal and API protocols, licenses for third-party plug-ins and development of educational software)Marketing- $5,000(Including multiple launch events, college campus tour, social media impressions, promotion literature)
Once our platform is fully developed, the process to join will be simple:1. Visit the website www.thevillageinitiative.com.2. Create your profile to join the village.3. Create a campaign explaining your collegiate journey and funding goals.4. Share your campaign with your personal village.5. After your campaign is completed forward your contributions to your lender.TOGETHER WE CAN BE CATALYSTS IN THE FIGHT!!
Student debt relief by way of community involvement? Yes - and it's about darn time!




The reason The Village Initiative will become successful is due to being a greed-free venture and having social responsibility built into each facet of our business. The way we see it, our end-users are the American people and our future generations. By joining together the end result will be a major shift in education because borrowers won't have the stress of debt to discourage them.

</div><p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>Hi!  We are <b>Daryl
McEwen</b> and <b>Bill Pressel</b>;
life-long friends and connoisseurs of all things biological.  After several years of collecting degrees and
paradigm shifting perspectives, we are incredibly excited to be focusing all of
our energy toward producing <b>local/sustainable
food</b>.  We have created a vehicle, NexTera
Agriculture LLC, to do just that.  At our Quarter Acre Farm, we will be producers, researchers, and contractors; to feed
you, discover how to better feed you, and help you feed yourselves.  But we need your help to see our dream realized.  And of course there is
something in it for you and the rest of the community; real wealth, not some
silly profit.  </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We have set a goal of
$50,000 and we’ll tell you why.  We have
our hands in everything.  We are
currently developing the soil on a 0.6 acre lot in western Rowan County, NC that we
promise to be one of the most productive ecological gardens anyone has ever
seen in our region.  This is a lot of
work, but it’s relatively cheap.  We need
this funding campaign to install our high technology projects.  Our first order of business is to erect a
controlled environment greenhouse; which will eventually be part sterile
mycology production line, part aquaponics production line, and part R&amp;D
lab.  This can be achieved with the first
third of our goal.  The second third of
the goal is to outfit these production lines. 
We need lots of equipment to make the optimized systems meet our production
goals.  The last third of the goal is to
make the system as energy and water sustainable as we can.  We would prefer Sustainability Plus; where we
leave the environment cleaner and richer than when we found it.  If we only meet part of our goal during this
campaign, rest assured this will be a highly productive farm.  </p>
<p>Consider this
crowd-funding campaign a <b>unique spin on
a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) Membership</b>.  For some of our perks, we
have included guaranteed access to our wealth production.  Once our operation is optimized in the spring
of 2016, our Domain Donors will receive fruits, vegetables, mushrooms, and fish
in monthly packages.  We promise this
will include some of your favorites as well as some highly nutritious,
delicious, and exotic delicacies, like <b><i>Hericium erinaceus</i></b> (Lion’s Mane
Mushroom).  </p><p>Though our goal is to have our technological systems optimized by the Spring of 2016, the few years that follow will be a time of maturation of the ecological gardens.  We expect our production capacity to increase year after year.  So, while this first year's CSA might seem like a charity case, you will see our ability to offer better and better deals increase to full maturity as our fruit and nut trees develop.  </p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p><b>NexTera Agriculture</b> is ready to take their hobbies to the next level and share it all with the community.  We earnestly strive to be a
strong positive influence on the local ecology. 
We want food forests in our urban neighborhoods, and we want to help
everyone become more self-sufficient.  We
want to avoid markets that create a price barrier to what should be the
inherited resources of all humanity.  We
want to produce so much that we can meet our obligations to our donors, and
still have enough to distribute food to the struggling, through volunteer
kitchens.  With a combination of high
science ecology and high technology agricultural systems, we are confident that
all of this is possible.  </p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>It’s really hard out
there for people not very interested in making a monetary profit.  Social media was an obvious choice for
our first fundraising campaign.  If we
were to have received a loan from a lender, we would have to charge inflated
prices for our produce (interest has no place in agriculture).  The only other challenge is time.  We are blue-collar lads putting in full-time
wage shifts just to make ends meet, but we spend sleepless nights reading and pursuing
our biological hobbies.  This grand
project will certainly make all that time well worth it.  We can’t wait to see the look on people’s
faces when they get a first-hand view of what we are creating.  </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">And herein lies one more challenge.  As we mentioned previously, what we are going to create requires a construction phase and some time for the ecology to mature.  The right time to plant a tree might have been ten years ago, but with our sound practices we will have the best soil ecology around, and we anticipate somewhat speedier growing seasons than most might expect.  We guarantee our Domain Donors a harvest in the first year.  And abundance in the years to come.   </span><br/></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We are extremely excited to have this platform to share our goals with the world at large.  We already feel overwhelmed with the encouragement we are receiving from our national and global friends, and we would love to share our perks with them for their support.  But our CSA program is obviously locally based.  We are not in a position to be able to ship either our Two Kingdoms Planter or our Domain Donor packages with ease.  These perks are intended to be distributed in person, at the time they become available.  For those outside our local area that are still interested, dehydrated and/or canned produce is a possibility.  And some materials for the Two Kingdoms Planter can be shipped with instructions on how to assemble it.   </span></span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The logistics of our package distribution will be developed and we will make sure those to whom we are obliged are informed of all activities.  As it stands, we are considering drop off points for regular produce pick-ups, but we will need to see who gets involved and where they are located.  We would also </span>graciously<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> deliver directly for anyone with outstanding needs.  </span><br/></span></p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Of course we beg you
to help us get the word out by sharing this campaign on your favorite social
media platforms (Indiegogo makes this really easy), telling your friends and
co-workers about us, or just contacting us about your interests in ecology and
gardening.  Our “company” has room for
