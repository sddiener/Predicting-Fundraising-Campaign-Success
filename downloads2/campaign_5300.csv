<strong><h3>About the Artist/Teacher Institute (aTi)</h3>aTi</strong> is a transformative professional learning experience and artistic retreat unlike any other where teachers participate in hands-on workshops in the visual, performing, literary and digital arts taught by master teaching artists. It's no wonder that more than half of aTi participants have attended the program more than once. Many participants say that aTi has changed their careers by impacting the way they teach and how students learn. Others emerge deeply connected or reconnected to the creative process.  The majority experience both. We welcome you to explore aTi’s impact both in and out of the classroom by browsing participant <a href=""http://njati.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">scholarship reports, lesson plans, workshop projects and testimonials.</a>

#artsmatter



aTi is a co-sponsored program of the New Jersey State Council on the Arts/Department of State, a partner agency of the National Endowment for the Arts and Arts Horizons. Additional funding has been provided by The Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation. For over 36 years, Arts Horizons has impacted the lives of more than 9 million children and adults through the power of the arts. We are committed to making the performing, visual, literary and media arts and artistic expression equitable and accessible to diverse people of all ages and abilities. We believe that the arts are fundamental to a child's education, stimulating learning, enriching the teaching process and providing lifelong learning. Our exceptional programs are customized to meet the unique needs and goals of your population and site. We provide:



Engaging residency programs conducted by professional teaching artists
Interactive live performances
Participatory arts workshops for seniors that promote well-being 
Adaptive programs for populations with special needs and children in hospitals
Professional development for teachers and staff that builds skills in and through the arts



About the Artist/Teacher Institute (aTi)aTi is a transformative professional learning experience and artistic retreat unlike any other where teachers participate in hands-on workshops in the visual, performing, literary and digital arts taught by master teaching artists. It's no wonder that more than half of aTi participants have attended the program more than once. Many participants say that aTi has changed their careers by impacting the way they teach and how students learn. Others emerge deeply connected or reconnected to the creative process.  The majority experience both. We welcome you to explore aTi’s impact both in and out of the classroom by browsing participant scholarship reports, lesson plans, workshop projects and testimonials.

About Impact: aTi

Scholarships for full-time NJ teachers to attend aTi subsidize up to 90% of the program cost. Teachers who apply for and receive a scholarship select from a variety of arts workshops that aTi offers.  Scholarship recipients complete all the requirements stipulated in the application including submitting a creative scholarship report that captures that aTi experience.Reports are available here.


Topics include but are not limited to: Creative Movement, Creative Writing, Digital Arts, Music, Theatre, Visual Arts.

What We Need:

We need to raise $3,750 to provide NJ teachers with over 250 hours of workshops in art and technology. We are asking our donors to bring in $4,150 before fees on Indiegogo. With $3,750 in our scholarship fund, we can send more than a dozen teachers to aTi to gain skills in art and technology that enhance their professional practice and student learning. 

If we do not reach our goal through the Impact: aTi Campaign, we will be grateful for whatever donations we've received so far. Something is better than nothing and our teachers will be thankful for your generous support whether or not we get the full amount. If we raise more than our goal, any additional monies will still go straight to the scholarship fund.

students on the MA Art &amp; Science course at Central Saint Martins School of
Art and Design in London, and soon discovered a mutual affection for
alternative photographic processes. As artists and photographers, our practises
both explore humanity’s relationship with the Universe through imagery that considers the source of light, both solar and interstellar in origin, in the production
of our work. During the Story of Light Festival, we hope to highlight
the use of the sun’s energy, and our material
connection to the broader Universe as a source for creativity and inspiration.
The focus of Jaden’s hybrid art-science practice is an investigation of the
material that defines our identity as human beings and the connection of our
corporeal matter to the broader Universe. Melanie researches the parallel

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The ‘Story of Light Festival’
highlights the importance of light in our understanding of the universe, in the
broadest sense. With the increasing availability of telescopes, microscopes and
other optical equipment, we can look closely at objects we may have not had
access to before. More ‘amateur’ scientists are emerging to see the universe in
high definition, and as artists and philosophers we consider the cultural
impact of these. We were motivated to get involved with The ‘Story of Light’ as
our own artwork, research and interests mirror the main themes behind the
festival. Both of our artistic practices involve the manipulation of light as
an art material, in and of itself, and the optical use of light to view the
universe in depth. We would like to become involved in ‘The Story of Light’ to
encourage the local community of Goa to explore the use of light and simple
chemical compounds to produce creative, expressive artwork. In an age that is
becoming increasingly digital and ostensibly more complex, we would like to

<p>Dormalou Project is, essentially, an art gallery-on-wheels with an
emphasis on growing future artists and creating community based art projects.
The birth of this project came out of a desire to 1) run an alternative art
space that is accessible to anybody, anywhere 2) have a space to showcase
serious artists with a commitment to making art, as well as, giving back to the
community and 3) instill the need and desire for creativity and art in the next
generation. <br/>
<span>Each
featured artist is encouraged to assist Dormalou Project in designing and/or

     come from?</b></p>
<p>Dormalou is the combination of two names: Doris Marie and
Mattie Lou. Doris Marie was my cousin, sister, and best friend. Unfortunately,
she passed away when we were both sixteen years old. It was a very hard loss
and her memory influences much of my work.  Mattie Lou is the name of my late maternal
grandmother. I lost her in May of 2012. She was my #1 fan in everything I do and
one of my favorite people. Her loss was the hardest of all. It is with great
love and affection that I name this project after them. I only wish that they
could be here to share in its success.</p>
<p><b>Are you a nonprofit organization?</b></p>
<p>No.
Dormalou Project is a for-profit art gallery. 
However, a portion of our profits go back into the community by way of
our free monthly arts and crafts tables, discounted pricing for schools and
non-profit organizations, several free workshops, charity fund-raising, and
annual scholarships. </p>
<p><b>What type of scholarships?</b></p>
<p>Dormalou Project will give two scholarships at the end of
each school year. One scholarship, The Doris Marie Hawkins Scholarship, will be
given to one graduating senior enrolling into a two year or four college
program for the visual or performing arts (including music). The second
scholarship, The Mattie Lou Henry Scholarship, will be given to one graduating
senior enrolling into a two year or four year college program for literary art.
Each student must be recommended by a teacher or school official.</p>
<p><b>What will you do with the money?</b></p>
<p>The
money that Dormalou Project raises will help to make-over the exterior of the
bus, including graphics and a professional paint job with the help of Galveston
artist <a href=""http://www.gabrielprusmack.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gabriel Prusmack</a>, various cosmetic and mechanical repairs, electrical work
for display lighting, air conditioning, interior rehab and installation of
display panels, a wheelchair lift, art supplies for our free crafts tables, and
a community block party to celebrate, once the renovation is complete.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1086796/files/20141210103234-gabriel_prusmack.jpg?1418236354"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>What happens if you don’t raise all the money?</b></p>
<p>If we don’t raise all the money, then we will continue to move
forward with all of our plans; however, it may be a much longer process because
we will not have the funds needed to finish sooner. We will still be successful
in that we have introduced Dormalou Project to many more people. But, we would
really like to ride through Houston’s Art Car Parade in 2015.</p>
<p><b>What kind of shows will Dormalou Project have?</b></p>
<p>Like many art galleries, we’ll have art shows that showcase an
individual or a group of artists. Our events will include artists of all ages
and career levels. Shows can include visual art, literature, music, and
performance.  We will also take our shows
to art markets and festivals, while always including in our schedule a free
arts and crafts table for the kids (and adults) that attend. Dormalou Project
will also be available for school visits, organization visits, private parties,
etc. </p>

With both of us having a secure relationship with God, we'll both overcome these small obstacles. For the past year we've tried to conceive naturally, but it's been a little challenging on both ends. Some days are mentally and physically draining. So, just imagine how many Red Bulls I have to drink. Oh! and not to mention my lower back problems I’ve suddenly acquired. Nevertheless, it’s one thing to put all of our energy into fear, doubt, worries, giving up and throwing in the towel but then again that would result into troublesome thoughts. But neither one of these are an option, we’re both natural born fighters. <p>As a teen my fiancé has persevered through some difficult times. She experienced having a 7lb tumor on her left ovary which resulted in a left Oophorectomy at the tender age of 15. Several years later she suffered the gruesome pain and agony of an ectopic pregnancy which also resulted in the removal of her right fallopian tube. So, you see? We have a little mix &amp; match thing going on here as to why it makes it a little less than possible to concieve naturally. But with friends and family praying by her side she was able to overcome and pull through such a horrible situation not knowing the nightmare it would cause her almost 20 years later. I mean she's literally Super-Women, Iron-Women and one of the toughest UFC fighters all balled into one beautiful specimen of a lady.</p><p></p><p>When I first met my fiancé our time was shared with laughter and jokes all the time. Laughter always plays a centric part of our relationship. Whether we’re out on dinner dates, trips to the farmers market picking out weird looking vegetables like Asian egg plants, showing off our signing vocals during Karaoke night while mumbling the words to Marvin Gaye's ""let's get it on"" we never fail to amuse each other and those around us. Two weeks before I mustard up enough courage to get on one knee to ask my beautiful lady if she’d start and finish the rest of her life with me until the both of our last breath (luckily enough for me her reply was ""YES"") she recieved a phone call from her Doctor saying that she had abnormal findings and she needed to come in ASAP. Sadly it was cervical cancer, and that my dear friend is when our whole world turned gloomy. At that very moment it simply changed the perception for our families and the both of us. After that very moment it made us value and cherish every single moment that we're blessed to have on God’s green earth.</p><p> It's taken a couple of weeks, days and hours to grasp, the concept of the treatment she would have to endure, but I can tell you this, we've never stopped laughing, smiling and cracking Jokes with each other. When life hands you lemons sometime you gotta suck it up and make lemon pie or lemonade. Right? We’ll, we've spent countless hours researching and studying the success rate and cost of the IVF procedure. Thus far we’ve managed to save 1/3 of the cost of the procedure which will be $16,000. However, time is a ticking away and it seems like we're running out of options. Our testimony is not another sad story or cry for help in order to raise donation for the IVF process. This is simply a blessing that I can vent out to the social media world and maybe just maybe somebody out there can relate to our struggle, and rejoice with us.

<p></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px;""><br/></span></p></div>","Hi!  I'm a thangka painter - which means I paint Buddhist and Hindu deities.  I also practice a Buddhist healing practice called Chod and that is what my campaign is about:  I want to create a large painting (45” by 56”) of the Chöd
practice in a traditional style but for a Western audience. My goal is to
paint a beautiful, detailed, and awe-inspiring educational tool for
practitioners who are learning the
practice and visualizations.   My fundraising goals are to raise money for residency fees at the
Movement Center to allow me to work on the painting as much as possible and not have to work on other commissions.  Paintings like this traditionally can take
a year to complete.  I plan on
working on it for one to two years. 
 You can see more of my work at LauraSanti.com to see I have the
skill and perseverance to complete a painting like this.  And you'll
enjoy the art!  ;-DYou can buy prints of my art here: LauraSantiSacredArtChöd is a Tibetan Buddhist healing ritual
practice, between six and eight thousand years old - predating all known
religions. It is a complete spiritual practice for self-cultivation and
self-realization as well. When I was practicing acupuncture, I was advised to do Chöd
for my patients and to keep myself healthy. From personal experience I can tell
you that it is a versatile and resilient tool, serving both the practitioner
and the recipient. 
Anyone in the health professions could
benefit from learning this practice and doing its short, silent form for their
patients as well as for their own health. Chöd is subtle and powerful. Simple to do, but effective. 
 Chöd is also something that people without the funds to attain a
formal healthcare education can learn.  The Movement
Center asks for only a small amount of money to initiate and  teach people
the practices, because we want to give these tools to anyone who sincerely
wants them.
 Chod visualizations are at first complex and unusual, coming
from a different cultural mindset, and then later beautiful and powerful the
longer they are practiced.  I think as westerners it is easy to
get caught up in the unusual aspect and then not be able to wait for the
practice to take root and unfold.  I want to
help people past these first hurdles.  
 My Chöd teacher, Lama Tsering Wangdu Rinpoche (LamaWangdu.org),
completed the traditional training, which included practicing in 108 cremation
grounds in and around Tibet. He is a lineage holder of the Longchen Nyingthig,
Shije, and Chöd practice traditions. He has been recognized as a living
treasure by the people of Nepal, where he has lived since the Chinese
occupation of Tibet.  In 2000 the Dalai Lama directed him to establish a new
monastery there to teach others his practice. He is now the abbot of Pal Gyi
Langkor Jangsem Kunga Ling Monastery in Boudha, Nepal. He met my guru, Swami
Chetanananda (www.Chetanananda.org/home/about/bio/),

Chetanananda and Lama Wangdu then taught Chöd to students at The Movement
Center, where I study. Rinpoche currently divides his time between Nepal and
Portland, where we teach Chöd and conduct it for the public on a regular basis.
  This painting
would be part of the Movement Center’s outreach to the Portland community and
the world at large to inform and inspire people about this tool that can help
people improve the quality of their life. 
My teachers have given me their blessing and encouragement in
this project. It is up to me to find a way.  I invite you
will join me in the process -  it will be fun to see the painting
unfold here and on my Facebook page, Laura Santi Sacred Art.  contact me if
you have any questions or wishes for different types of perks (gifts!) at Laura@LauraSanti.com

<p><b>THE IMPACT</b></p>
<p>The Northern Spark festival offers hundreds of local and national artists a huge, public platform. </p>
<p><b>Artists benefit from a truly unique opportunity</b> to stretch the boundaries of what's possible, launch or build their careers, and often create larger than life work on a massive stage. In turn, <b>our audiences get to witness and participate in once-in-a-lifetime experiences.</b></p>
<p>Moreover, we partner with cultural institutions to keep their doors open and admission-free for special late-night programming. This allows people to take risks on new artforms and experiences.</p>Community events of this scale and magnitude don't happen often or easily.      </div>
<div>
<b>Your support makes all the difference. Help us continue to energize our creative community and vibrant city!</b>

<p><b>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</b></p>
<p>The biggest challenge of an outdoor festival is inclement weather. After four festivals, we've learned a few lessons about organizing an all-night, outdoor festival. On the bright side, the Farmer's Almanac forecast for Minneapolis in mid-June 2015 is “hotter and drier than normal.” Still, we'll be making some format changes this year to better support individual artists, their projects, and the festival experience in the event of rain.</p>

</div></div>","Northern Spark—the annual, dusk until dawn arts festival that lights up Minneapolis on the second Saturday of June—is turning 5 in 2015!  To celebrate our 5th year, we're challenging our fans and friends to help us fund five new artist commissions for Northern Spark 2015. The festival is presented by Northern Lights.mn, a Minneapolis-based non-profit arts organization whose mission is to transform our sense of what’s possible in public space by supporting artists in creating and presenting interactive, technology-focused, site-specific art. Since 2011, tens of thousands of pedestrians and glowing cyclists have gathered for one night each June to experience what happens when artists take over the city in unexpected ways. Think: giant projections on buildings, breath-taking performances under bridges, and surprising encounters with artists. 
“There’s really nothing quite like it. Hundreds of creative thinkers connecting with a single goal of making this one night of art take place. This is what it means for a community to have a soul.” - Piotr Szyhalski, participating artist, NS 2011-14This year we are raising funds to directly support emerging artists presenting at Northern Spark 2015. Every dollar raised helps them bring their vision to life. There's a big difference between what $1000 and $5000 can mean to a project's success, and ultimately how that translates to everyone's experience of their projects. That is why we have set our sights on $25,000 to support five emerging artist projects. 

The open call selection process is a unique opportunity for any emerging artist to have a chance to show their work at the festival. The call for 2015 projects is currently open (details here). Artists and teams will be selected in January. 
Raising these critical funds now will allow us to give projects and artists the attention they deserve in the months leading directly up to the June festival.   (Read: No more Spring crowd-sourced funding campaigns! )
If you've loved Northern Spark in the past, this is your chance to give back.   Donate now to be part of the next festival in a necessary and meaningful way.



Why is funding needed?




Our event is free to attend. Keeping it accessible is important to us. 


Supporting artists in the creation and presentation of art in the public sphere is not free. In fact, it requires additional resources because the infrastructure for necessities like lighting and electricity simply isn't there.


The inaugural Northern Spark event was a pie-in-the-sky idea made possible largely through a major government grant that is no longer available to us. We now rely on several income sources, including the government, foundations, businesses, and a lot of individuals, like you! 



Here's how your dollars directly support Open Call projects:

Artist fees
Technical support (i.e. engineers, producers, electricians, etc)

Site permits and security

Electricity, lighting, and audio support

Signs and materials

Clean up
Cherry pickers!





THE IMPACT
The Northern Spark festival offers hundreds of local and national artists a huge, public platform. 
Artists benefit from a truly unique opportunity to stretch the boundaries of what's possible, launch or build their careers, and often create larger than life work on a massive stage. In turn, our audiences get to witness and participate in once-in-a-lifetime experiences.
Moreover, we partner with cultural institutions to keep their doors open and admission-free for special late-night programming. This allows people to take risks on new artforms and experiences.Community events of this scale and magnitude don't happen often or easily.      

Your support makes all the difference. Help us continue to energize our creative community and vibrant city!







THE PERKS 
Help us commission five new art projects, and pick up one of our great perks, like:

<h1>Project Overview</h1>
<p>I am an artist and 2014 BFA graduate of Westminster College who 
creates large scale sculptures and installations from found plastic objects 
such as bottle caps and shopping bags.  Recently I applied to the show 
“Multiplicities: New Directions in Fiber” at the IMAGO Gallery in 
Warren, Rhode Island.  </p>
<p>My sculpture, <i>Bolbitous Aqualescent </i>was
 accepted.  It is made from over 18,000 plastic bottle caps and 
thousands of shopping bags.  My work requires the help of a community of
 over 150 people (listed below) to collect the tens of thousands of 
plastic objects for my art.  Their involvement is a crucial part of my 
art making process as well as the conceptual framework of it.   </p>
<p>I have created this Indiegogo project to once again call on the help of a community to help me ship <i>Bolbitous Aqualescent</i>
 to the exhibition in Rhode Island.  I live over 500 miles from the 
gallery and cannot afford the shipping costs all by myself to get the 
sculpture to the exhibition.  That is where you come in! I was really 
excited to find out my work was accepted, but was disappointed when I 
took the 6 foot long box to UPS only to find out that it will cost $185 
to ship it to RI and another $185 to ship is back after the show.  The remainder of the funds raised will be used for the material costs of: the signed photo print rewards; the art collector reward; art patron reward; and the shipping costs to get the rewards to you.<br/></p>
<p>Even if the project is not fully funded any money that is raised will still go towards the shipping cost and I will try to come up with the rest.  I really do not want to have to withdraw from this great exhibition. <br/></p>
<p>Being
 a recent college graduate with living expenses and now college debt to 
repay, I cannot cover the shipping costs on my own.  Please help me get 
my sculpture to Rhode Island.  </p>

<h3>Artist Statement<br/>
</h3>
<p>My work is an investigation of the energy that resides in mundane 
plastic objects. Many of the objects we consume are made of plastic - a 
material engineered to last thousands of years, yet it makes up a 
majority of disposable products. Throughout the objects’ short 
lifecycles, we use them once or twice before we toss them. During that 
short period of time, our physical interactions with those objects 
transfer energy to them, energy that is lost when the objects are thrown
 away. Those objects become lost fragments of reality, minute traces of 
human presence that are scattered across landfills and landscapes. Those
 fragments create a broken sub-reality, a reality we willingly yet 
unknowingly create. It is our creation of and interaction with those 
objects that creates this sub-reality; however, no one wants to claim 
this reality as theirs. We go as far as paying to ensure that these 
fragments are taken to the dump so we are no longer connected to them. 
My work reveals this sub reality through the aggregation of found 
plastic objects. I rely on the help of over 150 people to collect the 
objects I use.  Their efforts are essential to not only the creation of 
my sculptures, but also the conceptual framework of it. My work brings 
the discarded fragments of our lives together, allowing the sub-reality 
they create to be observed and analyzed for its aesthetics, its energy 
and its involvement in the world we live in.</p>

</h3>
<p>There are very minimal risks involved with this project.  I can have the photo prints signed and mailed within a month, the ""Trametes Sulphureus"" mini installations are already created and ready to ship and I will have plenty of time to make the wooden ""Node"" sculpture and have it shipped to you by December if you fund at the Art Patron Level.  If there is more than 1 Art Patron backer then it will take longer to make the wood sculptures but I will do my best to get them to you as soon as possible while updating you with progress photos via email.<br/></p>

short period of time, our physical interactions with those objects 
transfer energy to them, energy that is lost when the objects are thrown
 away. Those objects become lost fragments of reality, minute traces of 
human presence that are scattered across landfills and landscapes. Those
 fragments create a broken sub-reality, a reality we willingly yet 
unknowingly create. It is our creation of and interaction with those 
objects that creates this sub-reality; however, no one wants to claim 
this reality as theirs. We go as far as paying to ensure that these 
fragments are taken to the dump so we are no longer connected to them. 
My work reveals this sub reality through the aggregation of found 
plastic objects. I rely on the help of over 150 people to collect the 
objects I use.  Their efforts are essential to not only the creation of 
my sculptures, but also the conceptual framework of it. My work brings 
the discarded fragments of our lives together, allowing the sub-reality 
they create to be observed and analyzed for its aesthetics, its energy 
and its involvement in the world we live in.

Photos of Rewards

Photo of Trametes Sulphureus mini-installation for the art collector level reward.
They are made of found plastic shopping bags and thread and are attached to the wall with small pins.



Photo of a wooden Node sculpture for the Art Patron level reward.
Node No. 1 (of the dance)  Dimensions: 20"" x 13"" x 11"" (The Art Patron backer's piece will be a similar dimension, but a different shape)
The
 sculpture you will receive will be made using the same technique and 
style as this one, but will be one of a kind in form!  It will be made 
to hang on the wall.

  Risks & Challenges

There are very minimal risks involved with this project.  I can have the photo prints signed and mailed within a month, the ""Trametes Sulphureus"" mini installations are already created and ready to ship and I will have plenty of time to make the wooden ""Node"" sculpture and have it shipped to you by December if you fund at the Art Patron Level.  If there is more than 1 Art Patron backer then it will take longer to make the wood sculptures but I will do my best to get them to you as soon as possible while updating you with progress photos via email.

</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Joseph Stalin
(Ioseb Jughashvili) was one the biggest figures in 20th century world politics.
As a leader of Soviet Union, Stalin was involved in World War II and played the
decisive role in the victory of Allies.</p>
<p>Before his rise to
power, Stalin was based in Georgia the post Soviet Republic, where he was born
(Gori, 1878) and started his revolutionary activities. After being expelled
from Georgian Orthodox Tiflis Spiritual Seminary, he gradually became one of the biggest
revolutionary names in Caucasian region. Two most significant accomplishments
during his revolutionary youth are considered the 1907 Tiflis bank robbery,
(theft of 341,000 Rubles, roughly USD 3.4 millions adjusted for inflation) and
the establishment of an underground secret printing house. The latter supplied
Eurasian region with illegal revolutionary print materials including
socialistic proclamations, banned publications etc. The printing house played a
deciding role in successful accomplishment of 1917 Russian revolution. </p>
<p>The secret printing
house itself is located under a small residential house in Tbilisi, Georgia.
The only way leading to the printing press was laid through the well located in
the yard. The underground tunnel connects the well and the underground space.
At the moment the historic printing house (including the underground printing
press) is in extremely poor condition and needs immediate restoration. </p>
<p>The total amount
needed for printing house restoration is USD 80,000. The amount will be spent
on restoring the residential and underground printing spaces and turning it
into a unique museum representing socialistic revolutionary movement. </p>
<p>The funds will be
allocated for following tasks by same priority as mentioned below:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Pumping the
ground waters, the main threat for the underground museum</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Cleaning the
well, reparation of the ladder to comply with safety regulations</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Installation
of the underground ventilation system, lighting etc.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>The
restoration of printing press, which is heavily rusted but still preserved</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>The
refurbishment of the residential house, where Stalin and his associates lived </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Interior
decoration of the house and the basement</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Reparation of
existing exhibits and the collection of new ones</p>
<p>We are a team of
enthusiasts interested in preserving cultural heritage of our city (Tbilisi).
We are actively involved in restoration of abandoned historical places, trying
to revive them. We hope that your contribution will allow us to save the unique
place and make it available to thousands of visitors. </p>

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>Over the past few months, I have had the privilege of collaborating with Bay Area-based choreographer <a href=""http://avyk.org/pg1.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""erika tsimbrovsky website"">Erika Tsimbrovsky</a>, visual artist/sculptor/designer <a href=""http://vadimpuyandaev.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""vadim website"">Vadim Puyandaev</a>, and video/lighting designer <a href=""http://www.lucaskrech.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lucas Krech</a> on a new and ambitious interactive performance-installation production. </p>
<p>Entitled <em>Minotaur, </em>this project is inspired by the <span class=""il"">Minotaur</span> of Greek mythology, a half-bull, half-human creature with royal and godly origins, who is trapped within the labyrinth designed by Daedalus. In our project we present the <span class=""il"">Minotaur</span> as a mutant of our contemporary world, with desires for love, pleasure, power, and flesh, that can never be satisfied. When <span class=""il"">Minotaur </span>premieres, the audience will experience a labyrinth of feeling and sound and will enter a convoluted world of flesh and spirit.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>An Audio-Visual-Kinetic Experience</strong></h3>
<p>Equal parts sculpture, multimedia installation, and dance performance, <em>Minotaur </em>will feature a modular architecture, adapting to multiple gallery, concert stage, and outdoor settings. Dancers will performatively inhabit and explore a transparent labyrinth, whose surfaces will be animated via live painting, light and video projection, and sonic vibrations.</p>
<p>This labyrinth will by no means be insular or exclusive: as video and sound continuously collected from the performance/exhibition space are processed and transmitted into the labyrinth structure, the visual and auditory sensations within the constructed space are radiated back onto the audience.  As such, boundaries between internal and external spaces will become porous, and the experience will be immersive and unpredictable for audience members and performers alike.  No two performances will be the same! </p>
<p><em>Minotaur </em>will be premiered during the 2012-2013 season in San Francisco (venue to be determined). We hope to subsequently present it in a variety of venues in the San Francisco Bay Area, nationally, and internationally. </p>
<p>  </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Currently, we are in our first production phase, on a residency at the <a href=""http://www.dresherensemble.org/arc.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Paul Dresher Artist Residency Center</a> in Oakland, CA. We have been operating thus far on a minimal budget, which has limited our capacity to construct the multimedia labyrinth. </p>
<p>In order to move forward with this project, we are reaching out to you to help us cover our material expenses. These include the cost video, audio, and lighting equipment, as well as the hard transparent plastic material to be used to build the labyrinth walls. Due to its specific physical, reflective, and resonant properties, this material will be indispensable for the production. </p>
<p>The total estimated cost of these materials is <strong>$20,000</strong>. However: if we meet (or exceed) our <strong>$10,000 funding goal</strong>, we will be well on our way. </p>
<p>Future anticipated expenses include venue rental, transportation, and artist and technical staff fees. </p>
<p>In return for your generous <strong>tax deductible </strong>contribution, you will receive an exciting and diverse array of rare, customized gifts--ranging from limited edition T-shirts and tote bags, to exclusive interviews and masterclasses, to original compositions by Alexander Sigman--not to mention free tickets to a <em>Minotaur </em>performance! </p>
<p>If you donate at the highest levels, you will be the proud recipient of an original oil on canvas painting, costume, or life-sized sculpture by Vadim Puyandaev! </p>
<p><strong><br/>N.B.:</strong> Proceeds go to <a href=""http://avyk.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Avy K Productions</a>, Erika Tsimbrovsky and Vadim Puyandaev's non-profit fiscal affiliate of the <a href=""http://dancersgroup.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dancers Group</a>. As such, all donations are <strong>tax deductible. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Exploring timeless, mythological themes, and timely urban social and environmental issues through movement, visual media, music, and architecture, <em>Minotaur </em>promises to engage and inspire a wide audience. Given the work's universal relevance and  imminently adaptable format, <em>Minotaur </em>bears great potential to be featured on international festivals and exhibitions. </p>
<p>This project has also offered a rare opportunity for the four main artists involved to collaborate in a sustained, productive,  and meaningful way. It is hoped that this production will spark an enduring working relationship among the artists. </p>
<p><strong>Erika Tsimbrovsky </strong>and <strong>Vadim </strong><strong>Puyandaev </strong>have been captivating Bay Area and international audiences with their interdisciplinary ""audio-visual-kinetic"" works for the past two decades. </p>
<p><a href=""https://secure.vimeo.com/43214250"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Here are excerpts from <em>The Book</em>, their 2011 performance-installation combining dance, live painting, music, video, and audience participation.</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Sigman</strong>'s award-winning instrumental, electroacoustic, installation, and intermedia compositions have been featured at major international festivals, venues, institutions, and galleries. <strong> </strong>In the past few years, he has collaborated with filmmakers, video artists, choreographers, and product designers. His first portrait recording was released in March on <a href=""http://carrierrecords.com/index.php?album=sigman&amp;category=all&amp;artist=none"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Carrier Records.</a></p>
<p><a href=""https://vimeo.com/15309907"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><em>detritus II</em>, for video and electronics</a>. </p>

</div></div>","Project Summary
Over the past few months, I have had the privilege of collaborating with Bay Area-based choreographer Erika Tsimbrovsky, visual artist/sculptor/designer Vadim Puyandaev, and video/lighting designer Lucas Krech on a new and ambitious interactive performance-installation production. 
Entitled Minotaur, this project is inspired by the Minotaur of Greek mythology, a half-bull, half-human creature with royal and godly origins, who is trapped within the labyrinth designed by Daedalus. In our project we present the Minotaur as a mutant of our contemporary world, with desires for love, pleasure, power, and flesh, that can never be satisfied. When Minotaur premieres, the audience will experience a labyrinth of feeling and sound and will enter a convoluted world of flesh and spirit.
 
An Audio-Visual-Kinetic Experience
Equal parts sculpture, multimedia installation, and dance performance, Minotaur will feature a modular architecture, adapting to multiple gallery, concert stage, and outdoor settings. Dancers will performatively inhabit and explore a transparent labyrinth, whose surfaces will be animated via live painting, light and video projection, and sonic vibrations.
This labyrinth will by no means be insular or exclusive: as video and sound continuously collected from the performance/exhibition space are processed and transmitted into the labyrinth structure, the visual and auditory sensations within the constructed space are radiated back onto the audience.  As such, boundaries between internal and external spaces will become porous, and the experience will be immersive and unpredictable for audience members and performers alike.  No two performances will be the same! 
Minotaur will be premiered during the 2012-2013 season in San Francisco (venue to be determined). We hope to subsequently present it in a variety of venues in the San Francisco Bay Area, nationally, and internationally. 
  
What We Need & What You Get


Currently, we are in our first production phase, on a residency at the Paul Dresher Artist Residency Center in Oakland, CA. We have been operating thus far on a minimal budget, which has limited our capacity to construct the multimedia labyrinth. 
In order to move forward with this project, we are reaching out to you to help us cover our material expenses. These include the cost video, audio, and lighting equipment, as well as the hard transparent plastic material to be used to build the labyrinth walls. Due to its specific physical, reflective, and resonant properties, this material will be indispensable for the production. 
The total estimated cost of these materials is $20,000. However: if we meet (or exceed) our $10,000 funding goal, we will be well on our way. 
Future anticipated expenses include venue rental, transportation, and artist and technical staff fees. 
In return for your generous tax deductible contribution, you will receive an exciting and diverse array of rare, customized gifts--ranging from limited edition T-shirts and tote bags, to exclusive interviews and masterclasses, to original compositions by Alexander Sigman--not to mention free tickets to a Minotaur performance! 
If you donate at the highest levels, you will be the proud recipient of an original oil on canvas painting, costume, or life-sized sculpture by Vadim Puyandaev! 
N.B.: Proceeds go to Avy K Productions, Erika Tsimbrovsky and Vadim Puyandaev's non-profit fiscal affiliate of the Dancers Group. As such, all donations are tax deductible. 
 

The Impact
Exploring timeless, mythological themes, and timely urban social and environmental issues through movement, visual media, music, and architecture, Minotaur promises to engage and inspire a wide audience. Given the work's universal relevance and  imminently adaptable format, Minotaur bears great potential to be featured on international festivals and exhibitions. 
This project has also offered a rare opportunity for the four main artists involved to collaborate in a sustained, productive,  and meaningful way. It is hoped that this production will spark an enduring working relationship among the artists. 
Erika Tsimbrovsky and Vadim Puyandaev have been captivating Bay Area and international audiences with their interdisciplinary ""audio-visual-kinetic"" works for the past two decades. 
Here are excerpts from The Book, their 2011 performance-installation combining dance, live painting, music, video, and audience participation.
 
Alexander Sigman's award-winning instrumental, electroacoustic, installation, and intermedia compositions have been featured at major international festivals, venues, institutions, and galleries.  In the past few years, he has collaborated with filmmakers, video artists, choreographers, and product designers. His first portrait recording was released in March on Carrier Records.
detritus II, for video and electronics. 
 
Lucas Benjaminh Krech has designed over 300 operas, dances, plays, and performance pieces across the United States and Europe. Installation, lighting, and video art has been shown at Black Rock CIty, SOMArts, Studio Gracia, and others. 
Please visit Lucas' website for more information.

<p><b></b></p><p><b style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Let’s get acquainted</b></p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to check out my campaign. I’m Steven J Read, a
Minnesotan sculptor transplanted to Pennsylvania.  Currently I am working on my solo show, “Wooded Folk” opening March 2014.  Wooded Folk is an exploration of new ways of
seeing and interacting with the natural world. 
Wooded Folk uses a variety of materials and means to show that we still
can have meaningful connections to nature in our tech world without having
to cast away the “new” and become luddites.  The objects that I create start their growth
in the small stories from my history and combine the worlds of tech and
traditional to show that both can have a new, holistic way of
interacting.  Some of the techniques that
I employ are 3D modeling software, 3D printers, laser cutters, hand tools,
traditional wood carving techniques, and carpentry.  The end goal of Wooded Folk is an entire gallery installed with these objects, creating a space for the viewer to
explore how they are connected and new ways to connect to the natural world.</p>
<p><b>What compels me?</b></p>
<p>I have been lucky enough to live
and grow up with a direct interaction with nature.  Being raised on a farm and spending time in
the woods of Minnesota has allowed me to have a very personal connection to
nature.  I want to help people see that
there are ways to connect to nature without having to build their own version of Thoreau’s
cabin.  With your help, I will be able to obtain the materials needed to give each piece of Wooded Folk
the best capability to express these emotions and ideas without compromising on materials or methods.  </p>
<p><b>Where your help goes.</b></p>
<p>Your funding
will allow me to get the materials that I will need to bring my ideas to
life.  Within the world of Wooded Folk, I
have being working on a series of pieces about the process of making firewood and the impacts that they have throughout the different webs of
life in the world.  One of the works that
I am planning to make with your support is a geometric splitting

<p>-Steven J Read</p>
<p></p></div>","Let’s get acquainted
Thank you for taking the time to check out my campaign. I’m Steven J Read, a
Minnesotan sculptor transplanted to Pennsylvania.  Currently I am working on my solo show, “Wooded Folk” opening March 2014.  Wooded Folk is an exploration of new ways of
seeing and interacting with the natural world. 
Wooded Folk uses a variety of materials and means to show that we still
can have meaningful connections to nature in our tech world without having
to cast away the “new” and become luddites.  The objects that I create start their growth
in the small stories from my history and combine the worlds of tech and
traditional to show that both can have a new, holistic way of
interacting.  Some of the techniques that
I employ are 3D modeling software, 3D printers, laser cutters, hand tools,
traditional wood carving techniques, and carpentry.  The end goal of Wooded Folk is an entire gallery installed with these objects, creating a space for the viewer to
explore how they are connected and new ways to connect to the natural world.
What compels me?
I have been lucky enough to live
and grow up with a direct interaction with nature.  Being raised on a farm and spending time in
the woods of Minnesota has allowed me to have a very personal connection to
nature.  I want to help people see that
there are ways to connect to nature without having to build their own version of Thoreau’s
cabin.  With your help, I will be able to obtain the materials needed to give each piece of Wooded Folk
the best capability to express these emotions and ideas without compromising on materials or methods.  
Where your help goes.
Your funding
will allow me to get the materials that I will need to bring my ideas to
life.  Within the world of Wooded Folk, I
have being working on a series of pieces about the process of making firewood and the impacts that they have throughout the different webs of
life in the world.  One of the works that
I am planning to make with your support is a geometric splitting
log made out of acrylic mirror and a stack of split logs made of the same
acrylic mirror and corrugated white plastic. 
The second piece that your funding will unlock is a large installation
comprised of a sound element of a recording of the woods augmented with
birdcalls and a set of 6-12 different 3D printed bird models.  The birds will be printed with the different
collared filaments that represent their natural color schemes.  This array of colored printer filament will
be made possible by your donations. 
There are many other works that are stuck on the drawing board, but with
your help, their paths will be unblocked.

<p>The Agora Borealis has big dreams

Marshall Street bridge, at the intersection closest to the store.  Nicholas currently 
lives and works in Ruston where he teaches as an associate 
professor of art at Louisiana Tech University. He has recently been working on an art installation in Monroe, 
Louisiana. See the progress of his mural located at Luna Blue Yoga Center, 428 Desiard Street. We're confident he would be the right person for the job!</p>

<p><font><font size=""4""><font color=""#000000""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">My Story</span></font></font></font></p>
<p><font color=""#000000""><font><font size=""3""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In 1987, I was reading a book on alchemy when I became fascinated by an alchemical illustration representing the Philosopher's Stone. It depicted the Stone as a type of mandala with a heart surrounded by a thorny wreath and placed in the center of a cross that divided the background into four sections. Each section contained an image representing one of the four ancient elements: Earth, Water, Air, and Fire. The heart had five drops of blood on its surface and a rose bud sprouting from its top. Besides the obvious connection with the Sacred Heart, the five wounds of Christ, and the crown of thorns, the image inspired a deeper connection. In a flash of insight, I realized that the symbolism of the design was entirely interchangeable with that of the Tarot's World card. The dancing nude on the World stands in the center of a wreath and she can be interpreted, like the heart, as a symbol for the soul. The creatures representing the four evangelists in the corners of the World are also symbolically connected to the four elements through their Medieval correlation to the fixed signs of the zodiac. This realization was like a key that opened a lock to a forgotten door. I sat mesmerized as images poured out of this new portal in my mind. They formed a parade of alchemical illustrations that were spontaneously paired with Tarot trumps and it became obvious that the trumps can be alchemical, and that the series of trumps describes the alchemical Opus. </span></font></font></font><font><font size=""3""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This insight led me into research, writing, and drawing and after eight years the result was an uncommonly beautiful and meaningful deck. </span></font></font></p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p><font size=""4""><font><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The Impact</span></font></font></p>
<p><font><font size=""3""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">From the beginning, The Alchemical Tarot's publication has been linked to magical synchronistic events and its reputation has grown over the years. Original art for the Alchemical Tarot was exhibited at the opening of the Tarot Museum in Riola Italy, in 2007, and at the LA Craft and Folk Art Museum, in 2010, and the cards have been displayed on numerous television shows. Due to popular demand, I want to reprint this deck.</span></font></font></p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p><font><font size=""3""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The Alchemical Tarot was originally published by Harper/Collins in London, in 1995. That edition is now out of print and, although it originally sold for $35, copies have now sold for over $2,000. In 2007, I regained the rights to the deck and published The Alchemical Tarot: Renewed. This edition was redesigned and improved. The line drawing of an archway that formed the border on the original cards was dropped so that the drawing could be enlarged. I made improvements in the drawings, added shading, and improved the coloring. I designed a new back for the cards. When I designed the Lovers card for the first edition, my editor felt that it was too sexy and asked me to tone it down. As an added feature, the second edition included both versions of the Lovers, the one that was previously published and the censored version. The 79 cards were 4.75” by 2.75” and came in a tuck box with a little-white-book. Now that edition is also out of print. </span></font></font></p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p><font><font size=""3""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Keeping the the changes from that edition, I have again made improvements to clarify the symbolism in this 79 card deck. This is particularly noticeable on the eight of swords where the beast now has wings. I have redesigned the back with an image that gives insight into the symbolism of the four elements and have added more description about the symbolism in the little-white-book. I am now ready to print this third edition. In conjunction with the printing, I am finishing an updated version of the companion book and I am working with software engineer, Tony Newell, to create an APP version of The Alchemical Tarot.</span></font></font></p>

If I do not receive all of this money, I can print a smaller edition and I will make up any balance in the payment myself.

In 1987, I was reading a book on alchemy when I became fascinated by an alchemical illustration representing the Philosopher's Stone. It depicted the Stone as a type of mandala with a heart surrounded by a thorny wreath and placed in the center of a cross that divided the background into four sections. Each section contained an image representing one of the four ancient elements: Earth, Water, Air, and Fire. The heart had five drops of blood on its surface and a rose bud sprouting from its top. Besides the obvious connection with the Sacred Heart, the five wounds of Christ, and the crown of thorns, the image inspired a deeper connection. In a flash of insight, I realized that the symbolism of the design was entirely interchangeable with that of the Tarot's World card. The dancing nude on the World stands in the center of a wreath and she can be interpreted, like the heart, as a symbol for the soul. The creatures representing the four evangelists in the corners of the World are also symbolically connected to the four elements through their Medieval correlation to the fixed signs of the zodiac. This realization was like a key that opened a lock to a forgotten door. I sat mesmerized as images poured out of this new portal in my mind. They formed a parade of alchemical illustrations that were spontaneously paired with Tarot trumps and it became obvious that the trumps can be alchemical, and that the series of trumps describes the alchemical Opus. This insight led me into research, writing, and drawing and after eight years the result was an uncommonly beautiful and meaningful deck. 

The Impact
From the beginning, The Alchemical Tarot's publication has been linked to magical synchronistic events and its reputation has grown over the years. Original art for the Alchemical Tarot was exhibited at the opening of the Tarot Museum in Riola Italy, in 2007, and at the LA Craft and Folk Art Museum, in 2010, and the cards have been displayed on numerous television shows. Due to popular demand, I want to reprint this deck.

The Alchemical Tarot was originally published by Harper/Collins in London, in 1995. That edition is now out of print and, although it originally sold for $35, copies have now sold for over $2,000. In 2007, I regained the rights to the deck and published The Alchemical Tarot: Renewed. This edition was redesigned and improved. The line drawing of an archway that formed the border on the original cards was dropped so that the drawing could be enlarged. I made improvements in the drawings, added shading, and improved the coloring. I designed a new back for the cards. When I designed the Lovers card for the first edition, my editor felt that it was too sexy and asked me to tone it down. As an added feature, the second edition included both versions of the Lovers, the one that was previously published and the censored version. The 79 cards were 4.75” by 2.75” and came in a tuck box with a little-white-book. Now that edition is also out of print. 

Keeping the the changes from that edition, I have again made improvements to clarify the symbolism in this 79 card deck. This is particularly noticeable on the eight of swords where the beast now has wings. I have redesigned the back with an image that gives insight into the symbolism of the four elements and have added more description about the symbolism in the little-white-book. I am now ready to print this third edition. In conjunction with the printing, I am finishing an updated version of the companion book and I am working with software engineer, Tony Newell, to create an APP version of The Alchemical Tarot.

We are seeking to create a new format for interpersonal and community problem solving through mixed media art performances.  We will use your donations to support development costs of a character library, research and production of animation clips and costumes for performance, and choreography.  We want to take this work on tour and use it to help children and adults dance their conflicts away! 


What We Need & What You Get
(Break it down for folks - how much money do you need and where is it going? Be transparent and specific and be sure to address where the money goes if you don't reach your entire goal. For example, do you have other funding sources? Does part of the campaign still happen? Ensure people they are not just buying you dinner. Use this area to tell people about your unique perks, too!)
I have been selected through an international jury of art reviewers to complete this work but have only been offered partial funding for up to two months at Camac.  The scholarship covers 750 euros but there is an additional program cost of 1250 euros per month (about $1633), airfare to Paris and trainfare to Marnay sur Seine (roughly $1100), supply costs (estimated $400) and mailing fees (estimated $250).  As you can see, even with the support of the center, this is a substantial cost for a teaching artist to take on!
A total amount of $3320 will cover the cost of a one month program at Camac.  I have the option (with extended cost) to extend up to two months of residency there.
In gratitude for your support, you will receive the gift of artwork.
 For a donation of $15, I will mail you a set of 5 original post cards 
for $25 handpainted ""recycled art"" postcards
for $65, a set of archival digital photographic prints with a theme of your choice 
 for $75 a private yoga lesson (Baltimore area only)
for $100 an original piece of artwork
and for $200 or more an original painting or puppet to your commission (aka, to match your couch, personal portraits, theme of your choice!)  Of course each is accompanied by a personal thank you note.  Please see my website at www.elisabethgambino.com to get an idea of pieces you would like.


Other Ways You Can Help
(Unleash the DIWO! -- 'Do It With Others' by asking folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign. Don't forget to remind them about the share tools!)
Art can heal communities and individuals but MAKING NEW ART IS EXPENSIVE.  HELP US MAKE IT HAPPEN.
We would love to bring our performance to your community or publish the clips and characters in an interactive online format.  WE NEED MONEY TO DO THIS!
 Please help in any way you can by twittering, mass 
emailing, facebook-ing and sharing with others about how they can 
contribute and make this project a reality by using 
your wonderful social media resources.  Any donation is truly 
appreciated!  These things can multiply if you pass it along.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

My goal is to publish a limited edition book. To do this I need to raise at least 7,000 EUR. The more money I raise the nicer the book can be. Many details during printing and binding separate a good book from a great book and I want this to be a great book of THE ROUTE 66.
 


 

 

So motivated as ever, I contacted the iconic characters of the ROUTE 66: 

 - Mr DELGADILLO!! The latter fought for the survival of his hometown, which necessarily going through the preservation of Route 66. Having spent his entire life in his ""barber shop"" shaving indigenous and travelers, he founded with his brother, the first association of rehabilitation of Route 66 in 1987.

 

 
 


- Mr Michael Wallis Specialist Route 66, Wallis wrote more than 14 books on the subject !!!

 

 

You see, we just need your participation so that I can meet my idols !!!!!!!

 
 
Stéphane photographer in the middle of the Kustom Kulture under the name ""ROLLNSTEF"". Passionate United States and more specifically the years pre-65's.

 


 
 

 I was developing a personal technique in my photographic work, mixing photography, painting and Kustom Kulture.

 
 
 
 
My goal is to ask yourself if it is a photographic work, a painting, photomontage, etc. ....
 
 
 
 

You can find my photographic work and give you an idea of my world and what will be the imagine book project on Route 66! 

See here:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Rollnstef-ART-Ku...

</ul>
<p>The <strong>LiftPlus Basic Frame Wheelbarrow</strong> has a cold-bent durable steel frame. It has been designed with a single steel tube to provide the wheelbarrow with a stronger frame. The steel  frame and its wheel are adaptable for different uses and it can easily  lay flat on the floor.</p>

<p>The <strong>LiftPlus Carry-All Wheelbarrow</strong> has a hardwood base with a front 8° angle support wall securely attached to our basic undercarriage for a non-slippery surface that will hold materials in place.

<p>The <strong>LiftPlus Steel Pan Wheelbarrow</strong> has a sheet metal steel bucket of 6 cubic feet and 300 lbs capacity  attached to our basic undercarriage.

<div><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""font-family: helvetica; font-size: medium;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">What is a CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) Farm?<br/></span><br/>Our partnering farmers are all operating CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) farms in and around central Maine.  In joining a CSA, folks make a financial commitment to their farm by investing in a share of the produce at the beginning of the growing season. In return farmers are committed to producing the freshest, most flavorful, high quality food possible for their members (most CSA farms adhere to organic standards as much as possible).  Typically each CSA member gets a weekly delivery of produce from early summer through harvest. Community Supported Agriculture is a grassroots response to the growing social and environmental problems of our modern industrial food system.  According to MOFGA, Maine’s CSA community includes over 150 farms and 6,200 shares and is transforming relationships between people, food and farms. Each farm is as unique as the community supporting it. </span></span></div>

</div></div>","About CSA: Community Supporting Arts
The premise of this project is simple; we've partnered Maine artists with local CSA farms. The artists are busy creating art inspired by their farmers’ lives, work, landscapes, challenges and ideals.  Maine’s artist and farming communities are vibrant, idealistic groups, both key to our state’s unique sense of place, and the Kennebec Valley Art Association (KVAA) believes that artists can use the power of their artistic voices to effect social change. 
Artwork by all fourteen participating artists will be exhibited at the Harlow Gallery in Hallowell, Maine through October 2012.  Additional exhibitions focusing on select artist/farmer groupings will take place at partner venues in Maine November 2012 to January 2013, including Frontier Cafe Gallery in Brunswick, Maine Farmland Trust Art Gallery in Belfast, Savory Maine Dining & Provisions in Damariscotta, Sheepscot General's Gallery at Uncas Farms in Whitefield,  and more to be announced soon. The timing of all the exhibitions is meant in part to help spread awareness about local CSA farms as they begin recruiting new members for 2013.

What is a CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) Farm?Our partnering farmers are all operating CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) farms in and around central Maine.  In joining a CSA, folks make a financial commitment to their farm by investing in a share of the produce at the beginning of the growing season. In return farmers are committed to producing the freshest, most flavorful, high quality food possible for their members (most CSA farms adhere to organic standards as much as possible).  Typically each CSA member gets a weekly delivery of produce from early summer through harvest. Community Supported Agriculture is a grassroots response to the growing social and environmental problems of our modern industrial food system.  According to MOFGA, Maine’s CSA community includes over 150 farms and 6,200 shares and is transforming relationships between people, food and farms. Each farm is as unique as the community supporting it. 

What We Need & What You Get



In the true CSA spirit, we are inviting the community to invest in CSA: Community Supporting Arts and help us to connect and celebrate art, artists and the local foods community. The project has received grant funding from the Maine Community Foundation and from the Davis Family Foundation, and one of the reasons our grant proposals where successful was because we promised that the final fundraising effort would be this very cool grassroots Indigogo campaign!  Any amount helps, so please buy into our CSA: Community Supporting Arts today -- it's easy and we have great thank you gifts.



Other Ways You Can Help


We hope you'll chose to join our CSA project by donating today, but even if you haven't the means you can help us by spreading the word. Please hit the 'Share' button or email the link to this Indiegogo campaign to your friends. Also you can  start buying local today! Consider joining a CSA Farm and  buying locally produced food whenever you can.  Those of us who live in Maine have access to a fantastic listing of local foods resources at Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association.

<h3><strong>About My Sculpture</strong></h3>
<p><strong>My sculpture explores human nature. I like to question beliefs that we take for granted and tell the stories of the events, moments, emotions that we universally experience, even though we almost always feel like each is unique to us alone. </strong></p>
<p><strong>My work is classically based. I emphasize expression and subtle movement through my use of detail in hands, feet, facial tones and body language that I hope creates a piece that is both alive and meaningful to the observer. </strong></p>

<h3><strong>About the Death of Vanity</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Death of Vanity is an exploration of the so-called vice of vanity. We call it a vice, but is it? How much vanity is too much? </strong></p>
<p><strong> As you approach Vanity, you see a very beautiful nude woman, life sized, who is gazing at you with a bit of disdain. You notice a mirror in her hand and you can’t resist taking a look at your own image. You notice that she is standing on a wood butcher block and, curiously, there is a crow at her feet, staring up at her as if trying to get her attention. </strong></p>
<p><strong>As you walk around Vanity you see the cause of her disdain. She has been stabbed in the back with a large kitchen knife. Why? Who would want to kill Vanity? Can Vanity be killed? Should she? Looking more closely, you see signs of decay from within. You notice the small garter snake clinging to a tendril of her hair, a spider that has made a home under another.  Is Vanity alive or isn’t she? As you circle back around to gaze upon Vanity’s face again you notice something new in her expression; Just a hint of insecurity. </strong></p>

<h3><strong>My Goal for the Vanity Project</strong></h3>
<p><strong>My goal for The Death of Vanity is to donate her to the New Orleans Museum of Art. I went to high school in New Orleans and developed my love of art and sculpture there. I think the piece is uniquely suited for both the city and the museum. New Orleans is a glorious and mysterious town, full with exterior beauty and grandeur as well as interior complexity. Katrina tried to kill New Orleans, but like Vanity, New Orleans can’t be killed. A little bit of vanity is a good thing, along with a heart like that of the city of New Orleans. The museum has a great and diverse collection of art ranging from ancient to cutting edge contemporary. It is my hope that this sculpture, which blends classical sculpture with contemporary narrative, will find a home in the sculpture garden adjacent to the museum. But in order for me to open discussions with the museum, Vanity has to be cast and complete. </strong></p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Process and Timeframe for Completion</strong></p>
<p><strong>The sculpting for the Death of vanity is substantially completed. But that is only about 30% of the process. After a bit of clean-up work from me, the next step will be to work with Smart Castings foundry in Sarasota to create the multi-piece mold and then to cast the piece in bronze using the lost wax method. For more information about the casting process, click <a href=""http://donnagordongallery.com/donnagordonstudio_bronzecasting.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The Casting Process"">HERE</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong> I anticipate that the transformation from clay to bronze will take 8 to 10 weeks and will commence after the donation period ends, assuming I fully reach my goal. Even if I don't fully reach my goal, I can complete phases as you see below - the stages of the casting and delivery process and the cost for each.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Death of Vanity will eventually be an edition of 5, however this project is intended to create the mold and the first casting only, which will be donated to the museum. </strong></p>
<p><strong>This process is very expensive, and that is why I am asking for your help! I hope you will see it in your heart to donate even a small amount towards her completion - and that you will be a co-donor with me to the city that I love. Even if you can't participate financially, If you believe in The Vanity Project, please share this campaign with your family and friends! Spread the word! Thank you all very much! </strong></p>

<h3>The Mission (Dun...Dun...Dun!!!)<br/>
</h3>
<p>We are raising funding to build an interactive effigy for an outdoor 
festival.  This effigy will use perspective and imagination to create a 
hidden message to the public viewer.  This is a temporary installation 
which will be removed after the festival end date but will become a 
focal part of the environment and artistic movement during the open 
gates.  The structure will be burnt as an effigy should be in 
celebration of the festival's closing hours.  The structure stands in 
three totems within a large field as a series of organic wooden shapes. 
 The tallest of these totems being approximately 12 foot tall, the 
shortest being 8 foot tall with a lit design under each will offer a 
nice ambient tone to the artistic village.</p>

<p>I have less than three weeks to raise these funds, so if you would, please consider making your donation sooner rather than later.  Thank you!</p>
<p><strong><em>So, what I am doing this fundraiser for?</em></strong></p>
<p>I am asking for your donations to cover the costs of traveling, registering, lodging, and feeding myself in Fayetville, Arkansas.  Why I am I going to Arkansas, of all places?  Well, I recently became the Phoenix Individual Poetry Slam Champion.  And this offers me the chance to represent the city of Phoenix at the <strong>2012 Individual World Poetry Slam (IWPS)!</strong>  </p>
<p><strong><em>Why is this important?</em></strong></p>
<p>IWPS is one the world's largest stages for performance poetry.  Poets from across the nation will converge on Fayeteville, Arkansas, between October 4 and October 6 to compete for the title of World Champ.  This is no small event: a platform as far reaching and respected as this has catipulted many poets to the next level of their pursuits as artists.  And with the notoriety gained, poets can often help solicit new and extra resources for the community they represent--exactly like the community I organinize for. </p>
<p>I have never had the opportunity to compete at IWPS.  It has been a dream of mine for over five years now to compete at this level, but I don't have the resources to make this dream a reality all on my own.  </p>
<p>So, I need your support.  </p>
<p><strong><em>Where will your money be going?</em></strong></p>
<p><em><br/></em>1. All funds will be going directly to me</p>
<p>2. The funds will cover the cost of: </p>
<p>    A. A plane ticket to Arkansas from Phoenix ($500+)</p>
<p>    B. A shared hotel room for four nights ($230 approx.)</p>
<p>    C. Remaining registration fee for the event ($100)</p>
<p>    D. Basic food needs for the four days of travel ($120)</p>
<p>    E. If possible, a minimal monetary coverage for days off from work ($150)</p>
<p>       *(This is important, because I do not have paid time off at my job) </p>
<p>3. My best estimate is that I will need approximately $1,150 in total</p>
<p><strong><em>How about a little info on me?</em></strong></p>
<p>I am a restaurant worker, arts organizer, and poet.  My job and life ventures are humble, but I enjoy the principals of serving. I may not make a great deal of money, but I am passionate about what I do.</p>
<p>My life as an artist:</p>
<p>I started writing poetry in college. After my first performance at a coffee house reading on my college campus, I started writing and reading in the greater Los Angeles area on a fairly regular basis.  Upon moving to Arizona after college, I was introduced to slam poetry.  About 18 months later, I was hosting and organizing my own slam poetry show.  I ran this slam  from 2007 to 2009, in which time I was also the Grand Slam Champion in '07, and runner up in '08.  I represented Phoenix both years on a team of poets at the National Poetry Slam.  As of the summer '09, I took a haitus from slam for about three years.  Around March of this year, I returned to the slam that I am now helping to host and organize in Phoenix.  Slam poetry is something that I respect and value a great deal, and as a result, I have felt nothing short of privileged to be able to help develop and give back to my local community of poetry lovers, writers, and performers.  I have given a lot over my years in slam poetry, and the majority of it has offered me some of the greatest satisfaction I could ask for as an artist, performer, community leader, and person.  </p>

<p>Con la cabeza puesta en los Encuentros de Arte de Pamplona del 72, un colectivo de artistas y comisarios dentro de International Platform of Performance Art han elegido Pamplona como ciudad referente del arte del performance. Este evento internacional pretende como entonces dar un nuevo impulso a la vida cultural de la capital navarra.  Estos encuentros del 72 al igual que PIPAF se ofrececieron de forma gratuita al público de Pamplona, en aquel caso en la semana previa a las fiestas de San Fermin desarrollandose en dieciséis espacios, varios de ellos la propia calle. La intención era involucrar a la ciudad en un gran happening con la intención de informar de las últimas tendencias y sobre todo establecer un debate directo entre el artista y el público.</p>

<p>El término Performance, se ha difundido en el ámbito de las artes plásticas a partir de la expresión inglesa <i>performance art</i> , con el significado de “arte en vivo”. Esto es lo que va a suceder en PIPAF, se realizaran diferentes eventos, muchos de ellos con una intención docente pero en los cuales siempre estara presente la acción, la corporeidad y su investigación, de la mano de talleres como los que tendran lugar en CAC Huarte, Hegan &amp; Dream y quizas más activamente, en las acciones de calle que el artista Abel Azcona realizará por el casco viejo de Pamplona con todo aquel que quiera asistir al taller. </p>
<p>En PIPAF también habrá cabida para las muestras de trabajos de artistas nacionales e internacionales de primera línea tales como <b>Maria Jose Arjona</b>, artista Colombiana  graduada en 1999 en la Academia de Artes de Bogotá. Quería ser bailarina y se preparó para ello. Pero luego descubrió que cuerpo y arte podían estar unidos de otra forma: el performance. Sus acciones -en las que siempre está ella de cuerpo presente-han sido vistas en Colombia, China, varios países de Europa y Estados Unidos, donde Arjona vive desde hace diez ańos. Su obra se ha caracterizado por su sobriedad y su impacto. Ella misma define su obra con estas palabras: “Mi obra tiene un proceso similar al que hace el cuerpo al digerir alimentos: pasa de la forma a la síntesis y, como resultado final, genera energía"". </p>
<p>El artista americano <b>Ron Athey</b> también será una pieza importante dentro de las muestras de videoperformance que exhibiran los espacios participantes. El trabajo de Athey explora temas difíciles como las relaciones entre el deseo, la sexualidad y la experiencia traumática. Muchos de sus trabajos incluyen aspectos relacionados con el sadomasoquismo con el fin de hacer frente a las ideas preconcebidas sobre el cuerpo en relación con la masculinidad y la iconografía religiosa.  Con ideas relacionadas con el accionismo vienes, Athey usa su cuerpo como soporte para la práctica artística, en muchos caso también el dolor como via para comunicarse con el público. Actualmente vive en Inglaterra y es colaborador habitual de revistas y periódicos como LA Weekly.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Su obra se puede definir bajo dos ejes explorados entre sí a través de una constante sinergia: el autobiográfico y el crítico. Esto hace que obra sea algo ambigua y esté considerada un retrato personal. Utiliza el arte como una herramienta crítica y a su vez de autoconocimiento. Su exploración artística considerada altamente autobiográfica indaga en su infancia marcada por experiencias de abandono y maltrato infantil, siendo su madre biológica referente clave de su experiencia y por tanto de su creación artística. Azcona es conocido por abordar el dolor y la resistencia física, sometiéndose a azotamientos, intoxicaciones, agresiones y diferentes torturas tanto físicas como psicológicas y no duda en enfrentarse a sí mismo. Azcona cuenta que cuando el dolor interno es tan fuerte, el dolor externo llega a desaparecer. En el terreno crítico de su obra, Azcona aborda temas como el feminismo, la sexualidad, las desigualdades, la política o la religión buscando poner en evidencia estos temas en lasociedad. </p>

<p>Continuamos con <b>Regina José Galindo</b>, nacida en Guatemala destaca por ser una poetisa que experimenta con nuevos escenarios fusionando la literatura con la performance. </p>

Ganadora en 2005 del León de Oro en la bienal de Venecia por su video “Himenoplastia”, en el cual la artista es sometida a una intervención ilegal de reconstrucción de himen. Fue una propuesta sumamente fuerte y gracias a ella también se le otorgó años más tarde el Príncipe Claus. En su obra resalta la denuncia contra el sistema político, tan presente en la historia del arte latinoamericano, y un claro mensaje feminista. </p>

Continuamos con Regina José Galindo, nacida en Guatemala destaca por ser una poetisa que experimenta con nuevos escenarios fusionando la literatura con la performance. 
Su trabajo se caracteriza por el contenido político que rescata elementos propios de su contexto cultural y de su condición femenina. Ganadora en 2005 del León de Oro en la bienal de Venecia por su video “Himenoplastia”, en el cual la artista es sometida a una intervención ilegal de reconstrucción de himen. Fue una propuesta sumamente fuerte y gracias a ella también se le otorgó años más tarde el Príncipe Claus. En su obra resalta la denuncia contra el sistema político, tan presente en la historia del arte latinoamericano, y un claro mensaje feminista. 


Nadia Granados, artista colombiana interdisciplinar. Se dedica principalmente a la performance utilizando habitualmente la instalación.

<p>     Welcome to my new project ""Art Needs Direction"". I have been stewing on this idea for quite some time now.  To break it down quick, it is an idea to sell my artwork and also raise money for a good cause.  Thanks in advance for your generosity.</p>
<p>The way this works is on the side &gt; of the page. There are rewards for your gracious donations.  Every dollar goes toward the main goal.  Ideally, if I reach my goal of $1,500, this would cover art supplies and my time + I want to donate $500 towards the foundation for Maddox, the boy that was killed at the Pittsburgh Zoo.     </p>
<p>     This is somewhat of a crossover of me getting my art out there and also helping in the process.  Generally in life, I always look to help someone in need; but asking for help is ironically where I need help.  I don't want to write a book here, but I honestly could.  So, instead of asking for handouts or forever trying to sell my art, I figured why not give back in every step of the process.  I literally try to make new art everyday.  I am not only honored when someone is interested in my art, but furthermore it is something that will always be a part of me. </p>
<p>     The idea of mixing business with something so personal and near to my heart has always been difficult .  I always wished that I could just make art and then not have to worry about selling it.  I have always just created paintings, and when someone wanted something I would make it for them.  But as I get older, I keep making more and more.  It obviously gets expensive to just buy supplies and not necessarily have anything supporting it. </p>
<p>     I am a firm believer that if you have a talent it is up to you to not only explore it, but share it with others.  If you sing..... well SING!.  If you are someone that is a fine teacher then I hope that you can find some way to share that.  It is this premise that all of my ideas for this project came about.  I paint and love sharing it with others.  I also like helping others but at times it becomes extremely difficult to help others when I should be helping myself. </p>
<p>     That being said, there are also rewards along the way that correspond with the project. They are listed on the side.  That is mainly the bidding overview.</p>
<p>     Buttttttt here is where it gets interesting.  Yes, you could get a 36""x30"" painting retailing as the goal amount($1,500) for $10.  If not, then all perks will be honored and sent out accordingly and all goes to the goal.  One disclaimer:  I thought it would be exciting to also include (1) limited BUY NOW bid!  That would obviously be greatly appreciated and exciting, so that donor would receive the piece.  For this scenario I am going to have 2 paintings comparable in size and price.  Ok, if I still have not lost you then let me recap...</p>
<h3>2 paintings + one family + many gracious donations = one goal</h3>
<p>     I will show 2 paintings.  You can donate any amount (every dollar counts). With your generous donation, I will also ask to include which piece you are interested in.  The project will run its course and the lucky winner will get the desired art.  I want to raise $1000 for artwork supplies and $500 towards the boy's family that endured such a great loss. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Charity Info:</h3>
<p>     The family and friends of a two-year-old boy, who was fatally mauled by wild African dogs at the Pittsburgh Zoo, have set up a Christmas charity to honor his memory. </p>
<p>     The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports Thursday that organizers of the Trucks for Maddox charity hope to make it an annual event.  The parents of Maddox Derkosh originally requested the trucks instead of flowers because the boy loved to play with trucks and share them with his friends. More than 4,000 trucks have already been donated. They'll be given to Christmas charities for needy children.</p>

<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
<p>My name is Andrew Kosorok.  I am a Christian stained glass artist and teacher, seeking to build bridges of peaceful understanding among neighbors of different faiths.  In the US we are blessed with freedom of faith, but sometimes poor information and fear overcome our natural inclination to be civil to each other.  Drawing on my experience as an artist, educator, and interfaith minister, I am exploring Islam through art--and sharing what I find.</p>
<p>The glass sculpures are explorations of the 99 Most Beautiful Names of God of Islamic tradition, Names which serve to guide the faithful in becoming better people--similar to the Christian Beatitudes.  As the sculptures are completed, they are exhibited in traditional galleries and other settings and provide a beautiful backdrop for communication among very different people.  As visitors view the displays, everchanging and unique as new sculptures are finished, fascination turns to respectful curiousity, then blossoms into a desire to understand and appreciate each other.</p>
<p>At the displays, Christians raised to hate Muslims open their hearts to their neighbors, and Muslims feeling constantly defensive realize their neighbors are fellow beings of faith.  Neighbors have a right not to be afraid of each other, and these sculptures are providing a concrete catalyst for this change to happen.  As the sculptures are completed and shown, the impact expands:  more people want to listen to their neighbors of other faiths, more people are grateful to find their neighbors care about them, and more people find the exhibits give them the courage to undertake their own constructive, peacebuilding projects.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The two overarching and parallel goals for the 99 Names Project are to build glass sculptures for each of the 99 Most Beautiful Names of God from the Qur'an, and to display them in 99 different cities--across the country and into the world--as the sculptures are being completed.  The individual sculptures have been valued at $9000 to $12000 each, but they are not being built for profit.  Each Name sculpture requires only $500 in materials, but takes about 100-150 hours to complete, and the effects they have on the people who see them are profound.  The project is divided into 4 sections of 25 sculptures to make it more manageable--as each work is finished and each exhibit is shown, the positive influence of the project expands.</p>
<p>The glass used is German New Antique imported from Europe, the paint used is a unique blend of enamel and mason stains I developed specifically for the project, the designs and structures are all original and derived from my expanding experience with Islamic art and history.  Because of the inflexible nature of glass, each sculpture is built out of paper and cardboard before final construction, and drilling holes in the carefully fit and hand-beveled pieces becomes an exercise in patience.</p>
<p>Sculptures for the 25 Names in the first section are completed, and thank-you gifts come from these unique images.  Each donor will be placed on an email list to receive updates for the project (if desired), receives a blank note card with an image of a completed sculpture (which they in turn can use for a thank-you note of their own), a piece of glass from the glass sculpting process, and helpful suggestions on using bridge-building techniques to strengthen a diverse community.  Also, wallpaper and slideshows from the series, a blank journal with cover images drawn from the completed sculptures, and fused-glass jewelry using designs from the project are among the thank-you gifts.  A photo book of the first 25 sculptures with insights to what the Names mean, a selection of unique note cards drawn from the series, and an in-depth book on the process behind each sculpture are also included among the thank-yous.  And, to thank the spectacularly charitable at the $5000 mark, all the preceding thank-yous will be given including a full set of note cards plus one of the new Beautiful Names sculptures built as a result of their donation, sent along with a short film documenting its first showing.</p>
<p><br/>If the goal for the period is not met, all the money raised will go to building the sculptures--one for each $500 raised.  And every donor will also receive invitations to the exhibits and events in which the sculptures they made possible will be shown.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Building sculptures of the 99 Most Beautiful Names is not just about building art; it is a process of open-minded bridge building and peaceful resolution of differences.  The most fundamental connection in communities is between neighbors, and the most potent weapon against fear and misunderstanding is education.  The sculptures provide a tangible record of our ongoing effort to overcome apprehension and strengthen society, to build stable neighborhoods based on mutual respect and appreciation of differences, and to create an environment in which our children learn the practical tools necessary to build the peaceful world neighborhood in which we wish them to grow old.  By experiencing the sculptures, by visiting the exhibits, and by learning about the impact they are having, others who wish to build bridges of peace will know they have the capacity to do so, and will take their own active role in building a happier, more peaceful world.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please tell people you know about the project and visit my website for more information; I am always happy to answer questions about bridge-building among neighbors and learning how to overcome misunderstanding and apprehension regarding those who are different.  Feel free to visit my twitter feed, as well, and become a friend.  And don't forget to share this project using the Indiegogo share tools--sometimes the greatest impact we can have is through the lives of those we think we merely brush against.  And look for ways you can learn about those who are different, and help them feel they belong--this world is big enough for all of us.</p>

We love you!!   While the cards were designed many years ago with the situations of the time when the world was very different, they resonate today with timeless symbols that can be applied to our busy modern world. And not just our modern, western world, but also to any other continent, country or culture, including the Haitian Ghetto. So here comes a temporary, provocative and vivid tarot deck!On several cards we used the artists art, that includes symbolism from the Voodoo religion to embody the important meaning of the cards original symbols. The photographer  My name is Alice Smeets, I am a Belgian photographer, filmmaker, artist and teacher. My documentary photographs from Haiti are fairly well known and have won me several awards including the Unicef Photo of the Year Award 2008. For a long time, I have wanted to interpret the Tarot Deck with my photos, but taking ordinary pictures of the scenes seemed too simple. My aim was to create a very personal deck without loosing the different spirits of the cards. Then the idea entered my mind to combine three of my passions: the spiritual world, the Haitian culture and people as well as the philosophical reflections about the dualities in our world; in this case rich and poor.  Since 2007 I have been a regular visitor to Haiti and have lived in the country as well for 2 years. Its complexity and spirituality have played a big role in my life. The observations of the Haitian society have brought answers to many questions I have had. So taking the tarot pictures in the ghetto of Haiti’s capital Port-au-Prince was the obvious choice to create a very personal deck: moving away from the clichéd images of poverty, illustrating the spirits and meanings of the cards with a touch of humor in the middle of the slum and showing colored people for the first time on the traditional, old European cards to break stereotypes.   Collaborating artists: The Haitian Ghetto Tarot actors  All the artists of the group ATIS REZISTANS grew up in downtown Port-au-Prince, in an atmosphere of junkyard make-do, survivalist recycling and artistic endeavour. Their powerful sculptural collages of engine manifolds, TV sets, wheel hubcaps and discarded lumber have transformed the detritus of a failing economy into bold, radical and warped sculptures. Having known the group of artists “Atiz Rezistans” for a very long time, they immediately jumped on board to create the Ghetto Tarot deck together. Being very spiritual themselves and working a lot with voodoo symbolism, they immediately understood the spirits of the cards. Atis Rezistans were very helpful to find the materials needed and often created them on the spot, like the lantern for the Hermit that is created out of a old metal can or the black cat for the Queen of Wands and the animals on the Moon that are made out of used car tires.       Why call it Ghetto Tarot? According to the common definition, the ghetto is a part of a city in which members of a minority group live, especially because of social, legal, or economic pressure. The term was originally used in Venice to describe the part of the city to which Jews were restricted and segregated. Today, a commonly used definition of a ghetto (especially in the United States) is communities distinguished by a homogeneous race or ethnicity. Additionally, a key feature that continues to symbolize the demographics of American ghettos is the prevalence of poverty. Poverty constitutes the separation of ghettos from other, suburbanized or private neighborhoods. The Haitian people have long ago adopted the word Ghetto into their own language Creole and use it to name the poorest neighborhoods of their cities. Our idea behind choosing the term ""Ghetto"" as a name for the deck, is to provoke a discussion around the topic, to have people question their own assumptions about what the ghetto really is and to change the often negative connotation that the word implies in our culture into a positive one. The name of the Ghetto Tarot is inspired by the ""Ghetto Biennale"", which is an invitation by Atis Rezistans to visiting Western and non-Western artists to come to Haiti and create art in collaboration with them to produce a show at the end.

<p>«Construction»
is a festival of new media and audiovisual art in urban space. The
project appeals to physical and perceived image of Dnipropetrovsk,
discovering a new vision of its peculiarities and raising attention
to our commons: space, responsibility and future.</p>
<p><span>The
festival combines topics of urban planning, social and cultural
development, and creative needs of people living in post-industrial
and post-soviet cities. During the festival
week, symbolic places and public spaces of Dnipropetrovsk will host a
number of events. Thus, it becomes possible to draw public attention
to the outstanding buildings and forgotten spaces of the city, which
form its historical and modern image, to renovate their role in the
memory and to have a new look at their value.

<p>Surprising
locations will be chosen to enhance the positions of experimental,
interactive art and to promote participation of citizens in creative
process. New media will take a role of spectacular tool that reflects
flow of time at its best. The festival will be followed up by
discussions, presentations and workshops with Ukrainian and foreign
experts in the fields of media art, new technologies in art, and
creative urbanism. 
</p>
<p>Construction-2015
continues experimenting with city. Now we take a look at «form and
content», discover gray spots in urban fabric and check their
substance. Historical artefacts will be examined for their vitality
and tolerance of contemporary art. Social innovations will be put in
the spotlight of our creative research. And spaces for cooperation
will get the core point in problems of festival’s discussion and
educational program. </p>
<p><span>The
whole process of interaction with spaces and institutions will be
documented. So we will learn ability of an old to come to dialogue
with a new, to collaborate and to change. Is old form able to accept
new content and pass the survival test?</span></p>

backgrounds</span></b></p>
<p>Most
of the cities in Central and Eastern Ukraine have been growing in the
times of industrialisation, around the enterprises, which gave
employment. Ideology of the USSR was promoting development of
material and technical base, but not of human resources, or
development of personality. Civil open spaces were subordinated to
integrated system, and accordingly, many cities had nothing
individual to them. </p>
<p>This results in cities of today, without the
former centralised top-down system existing material and technical
base of cultural sector declines or commercialises. Commercialisation
of public spaces is recognised as one of urgent problems in
Dnipropetrovsk. With absence of social values and content in public
spaces, this vacant niche is taken over by drive of financial gain.
The situation is also complicated by absence of art higher education,
which would if there, create platforms to gather creative groups and
build up cultural context.

<p>Having
learned the cultural situation in detail while working on a project
«Cultural
mapping of Dnipropetrovsk»
(2012-2013), we have defined productive base for useful projects. The
central geoposition of Dnipropetrovsk, multiculturalism, dynamics,
and reasonably strong economic base are considered to be positive
factors. Post-industrial features of the city, with its typical
soviet infrastructure, neglect of former cultural locations and
problematic access to the city’s public spaces effect
destructively. This is introducing a number of challenges to young
artistic communities. </p>
<p>Therefore, we believe the following objectives
to be prospective: strengthening the role of urban public space,
developing its culture formative functions; development of non-formal
artistic education; development of dynamic modern technologies in
art, which can become a gathering point for educated and experienced
professionals in different fields; creation opportunities for growth
of youth artistic communities and multiplication of their creative
energy.</p>

<p>We aim to make most of the festival’s events free and as accessible as possible. The predicted audience reach is around 10 000 people. We are getting IT specialists, architects and local active youth involved in order to explore opportunities for the use of new technologies in art and city space improvement.</p>
<p>The festival team has already done a lot to ensure quality presentation of new technologies.  We are starting this Indiegogo campaign to raise the funds that will be used for the art program. Your participation will allow us to provide artists with resources necessary to bring their ideas to life and create unique art objects that deal with themes that are at the forefront of social discussion. </p>

 Audiovisual art and new media in urban space
                                               September, 7-12th 2015



«Construction»
is a festival of new media and audiovisual art in urban space. The
project appeals to physical and perceived image of Dnipropetrovsk,
discovering a new vision of its peculiarities and raising attention
to our commons: space, responsibility and future.
The
festival combines topics of urban planning, social and cultural
development, and creative needs of people living in post-industrial
and post-soviet cities. During the festival
week, symbolic places and public spaces of Dnipropetrovsk will host a
number of events. Thus, it becomes possible to draw public attention
to the outstanding buildings and forgotten spaces of the city, which
form its historical and modern image, to renovate their role in the
memory and to have a new look at their value.

Surprising
locations will be chosen to enhance the positions of experimental,
interactive art and to promote participation of citizens in creative
process. New media will take a role of spectacular tool that reflects
flow of time at its best. The festival will be followed up by
discussions, presentations and workshops with Ukrainian and foreign
experts in the fields of media art, new technologies in art, and
creative urbanism. 

Construction-2015
continues experimenting with city. Now we take a look at «form and
content», discover gray spots in urban fabric and check their
substance. Historical artefacts will be examined for their vitality
and tolerance of contemporary art. Social innovations will be put in
the spotlight of our creative research. And spaces for cooperation
will get the core point in problems of festival’s discussion and
educational program. 
The
whole process of interaction with spaces and institutions will be
documented. So we will learn ability of an old to come to dialogue
with a new, to collaborate and to change. Is old form able to accept
new content and pass the survival test?

«Construction»
backgrounds
Most
of the cities in Central and Eastern Ukraine have been growing in the
times of industrialisation, around the enterprises, which gave
employment. Ideology of the USSR was promoting development of
material and technical base, but not of human resources, or
development of personality. Civil open spaces were subordinated to
integrated system, and accordingly, many cities had nothing
individual to them. 
This results in cities of today, without the
former centralised top-down system existing material and technical
base of cultural sector declines or commercialises. Commercialisation
of public spaces is recognised as one of urgent problems in
Dnipropetrovsk. With absence of social values and content in public
spaces, this vacant niche is taken over by drive of financial gain.
The situation is also complicated by absence of art higher education,
which would if there, create platforms to gather creative groups and
build up cultural context.

Having
learned the cultural situation in detail while working on a project
«Cultural
mapping of Dnipropetrovsk»
(2012-2013), we have defined productive base for useful projects. The
central geoposition of Dnipropetrovsk, multiculturalism, dynamics,
and reasonably strong economic base are considered to be positive
factors. Post-industrial features of the city, with its typical
soviet infrastructure, neglect of former cultural locations and
problematic access to the city’s public spaces effect
destructively. This is introducing a number of challenges to young
artistic communities. 
Therefore, we believe the following objectives
to be prospective: strengthening the role of urban public space,
developing its culture formative functions; development of non-formal
artistic education; development of dynamic modern technologies in
art, which can become a gathering point for educated and experienced
professionals in different fields; creation opportunities for growth
of youth artistic communities and multiplication of their creative
energy.

We aim to make most of the festival’s events free and as accessible as possible. The predicted audience reach is around 10 000 people. We are getting IT specialists, architects and local active youth involved in order to explore opportunities for the use of new technologies in art and city space improvement.
The festival team has already done a lot to ensure quality presentation of new technologies.  We are starting this Indiegogo campaign to raise the funds that will be used for the art program. Your participation will allow us to provide artists with resources necessary to bring their ideas to life and create unique art objects that deal with themes that are at the forefront of social discussion. 
The funds raised will be spent on materials for artists and creation of the video report about the festival.

Beginnings

<h3>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>My life has been defined by certain markers – The kind that completely
shift one’s consciousness.  When I was
around 3-4 years old, our family moved to Fort Morgan, Colorado.  It was a dusty, dry, grassy place that I
called home for a little over 15 years of my life. Fort Morgan was sanctuary. <br/></p>
<p>I speak of markers and this one event marked
time in a way that I never thought it could. 
When I was 19 years old, my mom died. 
Last year marked equal time spent with her and without her.  After her death, the sanctuary of Fort Morgan,
and Colorado in general, didn’t exist in the same way.  It became both suffocating and laden with
emptiness. I moved to Seoul, not in an
effort to run away from the loss, but instead to run headlong into it.  After Seoul, came Portland, Oregon.  Time and space away from Fort Morgan has now equaled the time spent within its purple, gold, and grassy borders.  20 years since my mom’s death, it’s time
to return to my hometown – To pay my respects to her and to a place - To see
what has changed in me and what remains in my bones.  <br/></p>
<p>I speak of markers. 
There are undeniable moments when you meet someone and there is an
unnerving comfortability, a connection. 
Those moments make an impression because they are so incredibly rare.  Nearly one year ago, I met Lauren Hackett.  An unexpected and exhilarating collaboration
has been born of our friendship.  Not
simply a singular moment of collaboration, this is the beginning of a larger
body of work.  Our initial piece will be
a short experimental film, tentatively titled, <i>Morgan County</i>.  The intent is
not for it to be a travelogue, a saccharine sentimental journey home, or a
scripted film.  It will be a document of
a singular moment in time, in a singular place.  <br/></p>

I earned my education in ceramic arts down in and around Asheville, North Carolina. I spent a couple of years at Haywood Community College pursuing a degree in the ceramic crafts where I learned from a great mentor and friend, <a href=""http://www.lloydpottery.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Steve Lloyd</a>. I then stayed in the area to work and fire with my friend, <a href=""http://joshcopus.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Josh Copus</a>.</p>
<p>I moved back to West Virginia to be closer to family, friends, and some of my favorite whitewater in the country. I recently obtained 5 acres and 9 tons of heavy duty fire brick with which to start my pottery.</p>
<p>My goal as a craftsman is to create beautiful and functional pieces of pottery that are affordable to most everyone. I am highly influenced by the nature around me and utilize ceramic techniques that are reflective of the natural processes you see around you.

All I need now is the time to fit it all together. That's where you can come in!
With your donation I hope to have the money to finish up the projects needed to start firing my kiln. Your donation will also help me focus more of my time on pottery instead of the restaurant industry.
I am starting off small in the hopes of figuring out the needs of my business without overextending myself.  Some of the things I need to figure out as I grow are where to source clay, wood, and profitable avenues for selling pottery.
Chore List:


Complete the finishing touches on my kiln (which include cobbing the exterior and building a kiln shed).

Get a wood stove for my workshop. It gets pretty cold around here.
Complete my first firing (filling the kiln with work and doing a 12- 16 hour firing).
Adjust minor design issues that arise with the first few firings.
Applying to events where I can sell my work. (Craft fairs/shows, galleries, and farmer's markets)
Make more pots!


                                                      -Test kiln in progress-
Some Additional needs:
If this campaign goes better than expected I have a list of other projects that need funding. I need a new vehicle to transport wood to my property as well as take pots to craft shows. I have plans to build a workshop and kiln shed on my property that will make life as a whole more comfortable.  Eventually (within 2 years) I want to rebuild my kiln to a larger and more efficient anagama inspired design. For now, though, this little test tube kiln and garage workshop is perfect for my needs.


                                                                     -Vase Form-



                                                                    -Sippin Cups-
           
                                                           -My old studio in Asheville-

                                                            -One of my Planters-

  Risks & Challenges 
Fortunately for you, the risks are moderately low.  I have already done most of the ground breaking work by creating a space to work. I have also finished 80% of the kiln. So your chosen perk should be sent your way in about 5 months. If there are any changes to this schedule I will let you know through updates and emails.
I would like to mention that no two kilns are alike. All of my ceramic gifts have an estimated delivery date of March 2016. This is to give me time to fire my kiln a few times and work out the kinks. I want to provide the best piece of work that I can. Thank you for your support.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>WAAR is a new artist initiative in Amsterdam by Sara Bjarland (FI) and Gerbrand Burger (NL). Our main aim is to organize solo exhibitions by international emerging artists, with a focus on work about place, location, mobility and identity. WAAR will work on a migratory basis, using alternative spaces like industrial halls or empty shops for its exhibitions. This way we want to create original shows in surprising locations, using a small budget and maintaining a high level of independence. We think this new way of collective funding through online fundraisers like IndieGoGo, is a great way of funding art projects like ours, connecting artists with different people in a meaningful and interesting way.</p>
<p>WAAR will launch its programme of shows on the 25th of March 2011, with the 16mm film 'Sand' by British artist Naheed Raza. </p>
<p>Before the start of the programme we want to raise the modest funds needed to realize the first three exhibitions. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With your support, WAAR will be able to realize a series of interesting, engaging and experimental exhibitions and events. This way we want to explore the modes of exhibition-making in alternative locations, away from the strict 'white cube'. Through these activities we want to connect to both the local (Amsterdam) and the global network of independent artist initiatives.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The $2000/ €1500 we are aiming for, is a starting capital to get us going for the first three exhibitions (about  $650 / €500 per exhibition). Your contribution will enable us to provide for the necessary building materials and equipment to realise our projects, and also to invite one international artist to exhibit in WAAR.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal of $2000, we still want to go ahead and do as much as we can with the money we have raised. Any money we raise will be used for covering the costs mentioned above. Any contribution, small or large, will help us to reach our goal!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If you donate between $1 and $24 (€0,7 and €18 euro) we will be VERY thankful!</p>
<p>If you donate $25 (€18) or more, YOU GET: A BIG thank you and a bar of WAAR chocolate</p>
<p>If you donate $50 (€37) or more YOU GET: a limited edition print, made by us</p>
<p>If you donate $150 (€111) or more YOU GET: one of ten unique artworks of your choice, either a drawing by Gerbrand Burger or a photographic print by Sara Bjarland</p>

</h3></div>","So who or what is Nekomaki? What does he love to do in his free time? Well...judging by the piece of fish it's hugging I'd say we've got a clue. This cat LOVES Sushi!Nekomaki was once a cat with a dream...A dream to eat every kind of fish in the world...
..One day that dream was put on hold when he got too close to a delicious piece of salmon and rolled up into a little maki roll!
Right now you must be thinking ""That's awful!"" 
But don't worry! Nekomaki has achieved something no cat has done before. It has become ONE WITH THE SUSHI!

Literally...which is why we call it NekoMaki!


Many of you have gotten to know me over the years since I launched my brand ""Spoonful of Cats"". It's been 5 years since I started on this journey and I'm always looking for fun and exciting ways I can bring the Spoonful of Cat's designs to life for people to enjoy or even their cats!
.
Some of you have been with me since the beginning, and some of you I've just met. Either way I'm excited to share this next step in my journey with you!
NekoMaki was created with a combo of my love for sushi, cats, and those funny moments cats always get mixed up in. In this case, our little cat Maki wound up in a sushi roll.
It's roughly 11"" tall and 4.5""  wide!
Each Neko Maki plush is made with super soft minky fabric and expertly embroidered details. They also come with a nori/rice wrap and a piece of salmon that can each be removed!


NekoMaki is the perfect size for family trips and hugging!

However, As much as he loves eating salmon all day, he needs to get out to stretch a little!
You can pluck your cat and salmon right out of the nori wrap to let him enjoy some fresh air and stretch!Just keep a watchful eye, or your NekoMaki will run off; free to escape in search of more fish to eat and sushi to get rolled up in.


Maki is also the first sushi cat  plush for our ""NekoZushi"" Collection! 

Our cravings for sushi cats is strong so we have a lot more sushi cats prepared for the future! That'll remain a surprise for later on in the campaign~!



So what's in it for you? 
We know how much you love cats and sushi so we know you'll love all the awesome and fun rewards we have planned as well as some cool stretch goals!
If we can surpass our initial goal of: $5,500 we can push to try to have these sent out by Christmas and start reaching goals towards more Spoonful of Cats products!

Shipping is not included in the reward amounts. It will be added onto the reward you select. We've kept shipping costs minimal so you won't have to worry about expensive shipping costs!


This is  a special reward tier limited to 5 people! Using photos you supply us, we'll draw your favorite pet as a Custom 9""x12"" framed portrait! This is limited to 3 pets.This is  another special reward tier limited to 6 people! Using photos you supply us, we'll draw your favorite pet(2 at most) and make it into a 13""x13"" pillow! All pillows will be single-sided, 100% cotton, with a sham style back. They'll also be Machine-Washable, so don't worry if your cat gets hair on it!


TO BE ANNOUNCED...

The production costs of making Plushies(stuffed toys) can be very costly and that's where I need your help! 
With your support, Spoonful of Cats will push closer to becoming a worldwide brand! Not to mention get a ton of awesome rewards along the way! 
 


There are many challenges and obstacles to plush production, but we're confident we can face them and we'll keep you updated to any hurdles we may face along the way! The minimum order of plush we can do is 500 and we'll need close to $1,000 for ocean freight shipping alone. Here's a breakdown of the costs below via a cute cat chart:

We work directly with our factory in China. What does this mean exactly? This means we do not use a 3rd party company to work with a factory, but speak to our factory directly, which ensures smoother communication and transparency. This will be our 2nd plush created using the same factory. Our first plush was our popular original character: Rainbow Cat! The Freight shipping process(whether by ocean or Air) is crucial in understanding and preparing for, which is why I've chosen to work with DHL again to handle the freight shipping. DHL proved to be very helpful, intuitive, and professional when we worked with them to ship Rainbow Cat from overseas. 
Other Obstacles we may run into may be slight delays in shipping as we prepare paperwork for the shipping process and the possibility of the plush getting held up for a week or so as it clears customs, which is normal.When can I expect my rewards? I'm aiming to have most of the rewards shipped out in time for Christmas, however this can't be guaranteed and depends on if we can exceed our goal of $5,500. This will also depend on any additional plush that need to be shipped out and require help to process everyone's rewards faster. You will be kept updated every step of the way!If you are ever unsure or have any questions, don't hesitate to ask :)I will be here, and I will answer them to the best of my ability.

<p>We are newly founded as of August 2012 and exist in response to<strong> the apparent lack of an inclusive public workspace for all artists and activists in the Greater New Haven Area</strong>. In this case, inclusivity means <strong>free domain, no membership required.</strong></p>
<p>The town-and-gown divides that exist between the partitioned, transitory college-aged artists, locally celebrated artists, and locally unrecognized artists just don't work for a conscious arts scene. We aim to address the inherent pseudocommunity symptomatic of a ""college town"" - our work collectively is not just to open up avenues of connection between artists from different milieus, but also affect, on our own terms, responsible interventions into the public discourse. We're located in the heart of downtown New Haven at 212 College Street and we need your assistance! </p>
<h2>Our Upcoming, Prioritized Projects (and why we need your help):</h2>
<h3>1) The<strong> FREE SKOOL, our adapted version of SkillShare - </strong>
</h3>
<p><strong>Launching on November 14th</strong>, the FREE SKOOL as it stands is a community-taught series of <strong>free workshops</strong> to bolster basic creative agency in an expensive and alienating commercialized world. Anyone in the Greater New Haven Area, of any gender, sex, nationality, generation, race, capability, is encouraged and thoroughly welcome to sign up to teach or to learn. On the ""syllabus,"" we already have teachers leading workshops in intensive yoga, hitchhiking, graphic design, sewing, parkouring, disposable camera photography, figure drawing, tincture making, woodworking, broadcasting and working groups in protecting oneself against police brutality and raising awareness about violence against women. <strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Why we need your help</strong>:</p>
<p>Each of these workshops has a specific need for supplies, whether disposable cameras or thread and needle. Your contributions will go directly to these public resources. </p>
<h3>2) <strong>SPACE RENOVATION</strong>
</h3>
<p>New additions to the PAC team include members intent on installing a woodshop and DIY photo lab in our space's basement. These spaces, with a mandatory training, will be open daily to the community to expose photos and craft as they please. </p>
<p><strong>Why we need your help</strong>:</p>
<p>Photo supplies. Cheap lumber. </p>
<h3>3) ""RAD-ELM"" BOOKSTORE (name in progress)</h3>
<p>Approached by a local doula and activist, PAC now intends to delineate a portion of its space a bookstore/info shop engaging with responsible literature and zines for public consumption. This literature will be available for borrowing or for purchase, depending on one's fiscal availability. Themes will range from Black Feminist texts to How-To's on maintaining a vegan lifestyle. </p>
<p><strong>Why we need your help:</strong></p>
<p>To help outfit the space for the bookstore to be mean, clean, and full of sheen. To assist in stocking the shop. </p>
<h3>4) SOCIOPOLITICAL INTERVENTIONS</h3>
<p>At the end of November, the PAC team will be coordinating two local awareness campaigns in <strong>Gender Fluidity</strong> and <strong>AIDS Awareness</strong>. Our gender fluidity intervention seeks to affect popular visual cues that limit our ideas about gender, namely <em>bathroom doors</em>. After a week full of community discussion, a screening of <em>RuPaul's Drag Race</em>, and community design, the last friday of the month will see PAC fixing <strong>new inclusive symbols of gender</strong><strong> to the doors of the city</strong>. Our AIDS awareness campaign will focus primarily on raising awareness about the continued existence of infection in black female populations in the heart of the Greater New Haven area. </p>
<p><strong>Why we need your help</strong>:</p>
<p>Materials for placards. Printing costs for flyers, pamphlets, and petitions.  </p>
<h2>""So, how can I know where the money will go?""</h2>
<p>We are maintianing a <strong>strict budget transparency</strong> system, where the intake and expenditure of all funds will be published live on our website as soon as our indiegogo campaign ends. As of now, we can forecast that we will need, apart from what's mentioned above: </p>
<ol>
<li>A mere $3000 for our rent for the whole year! (yes that translates to only $250/mth) </li>
<li>$300 for Internet so our space can be functional as a hub and a research center</li>

<h2><strong>BABYLON SMITH: AN ILLUSTRATED NOVEL</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>STORY SYNOPSIS</strong></h3>
<p>San Angeles, 2260.<br/><br/>Babylon Smith is a freelance Regulator working the mean streets of the mega-city and struggling to make ends meet. Up to his eyeballs in debt from his many addictions, Babylon has to take on any job that comes along just to survive. So, when one of the city’s largest corporations approaches him with a missing person case at triple the going rate, it’s an offer he cannot refuse.<br/><br/>Babylon is tasked with tracking down a high-level asset who has disappeared under mysterious circumstances. At first the case seems simple enough but, as he digs deeper, Babylon soon uncovers a deadly conspiracy that threatens to destroy everything he knows. It’s a journey that will lead him into the heart of the urban sprawl where renegade corporations fight a brutal informational cold war, black market cloning and gene manipulation run rampant, sentient artificial machines govern the teeming, overcrowded streets, and Life + institutions offer virtual life after death.<br/><br/>Joined by his rebellious daughter Medusa and his ex-partner Royo, Babylon must race to unravel the truth and eliminate a ruthless menace before time runs out.</p>

<h3><strong>ABOUT US</strong></h3>
<p>We are Timothy Bacon and Paul Green and for the last three decades we have worked in broadcast media, interactive media, advertising and branded entertainment as writers and creative directors. We have had numerous screenplays and original television series optioned and have been hired by a number of production companies for rewrite, development and commissioned work.</p>
<p>In the world of branded entertainment, we have worked closely with world-class development teams and helped produce award-winning work on projects ranging from online worlds to digital toys, interactive video experiences, Intellectual and Licensed Properties and mobile applications. Our clients have included everyone from AAA title console games, hit television and film properties, sports teams, car companies, and a host of other major brands.<br/><br/>In 2006, we formed Mutagenic Studios to explore photography and develop our own art styles that would allow us to go beyond the written word, create unique imagery and push the boundaries of our storytelling. Our photographic artwork has appeared in the Montreal Mirror, Guerilla Magazine, Rue Morgue Magazine, and at the Fantasia International Film Festival, the Rue Morgue House of Horror, Club Sin and the 2011 Montreal Fetish Weekend.</p>
<p>The newest version of our website (which has only been up for five months) has attracted over 12,500 views from over 70 different countries.

<h3><strong>THE PROJECT</strong></h3>
<p>Babylon Smith is an illustrated science fiction novel utilizing a unique photo-artwork technique. It is the first book in what we hope will be a line of original graphic and illustrated projects that will bring our many stories to life. We’ve spent our entire careers creating worlds and stories for other people. Now, it’s time for us to produce our own unique visions that go beyond the written word.  This project represents an exciting creative challenge and a new beginning for us.</p>
<p>We have spent the last eighteen months in ‘piecemeal’ development on the book, spending every hour we can between paying jobs to get the project to its current stage. We have learned and developed photo-illustration methods that will work for the graphic format (our process is a combination of ‘live-action’ studio and location photography, 3D models, stock photography and a whole lot of Photoshop). We have written and rewritten the prose and taken around five thousand photographs of over thirty actors and models.</p>
<p>We are now gearing up for the final push on the book to hit our planned September release.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Apostles"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/242188/pictures/full/20120517161814-Apostles_WEB.jpg?1337296718"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<h3><strong>THE PITCH</strong></h3>
<p>We need your help! It’s been extremely difficult finding time between jobs to get things completed. There are only so many hours in a day and there’s still a lot left to be done. We need you to help us get across the finish line.</p>
<p>Creating the future is proving to be costly. The money raised here will allow us to complete six remaining photo shoots (average $400 each), put $1000 towards additional props and costuming, purchase about $500 worth of 3D models to add some more science fiction elements to the images and buy about $300 worth of replacement equipment (light bulbs, seamless paper, memory cards for the camera).</p>
<p>We plan on setting aside $1200 for reward fulfillment and the remaining amount will help to offset a few bills as we put aside some of the freelance writing jobs and put more hours into the production over the next four months. It would allow us to hit the late September release we’re aiming for and fulfill a long-standing dream of getting the book done.</p>
<p>Publishing a book in the traditional manner is an expensive proposition. So, in an effort to save money we’re planning on releasing the book through Print on Demand services such as MagCloud (for the magazine format and digital versions) and Blurb (for the hardcover print edition). Print on Demand will not only save on printing, warehousing, shipping and other production costs but also allow our book to be available on virtually every platform from book shelves to computer desktops to mobile devices.</p>
<p>Just pick a reward that suits you and be a part of our creative journey!</p>
<p>If you can’t help with the money, that’s okay! Just make sure to share this page (you can share using the tools right from this page), talk to friends about it and help us to raise support for the project!</p>

It would allow us to hit the late September release we’re aiming for and fulfill a long-standing dream of getting the book done.
Publishing a book in the traditional manner is an expensive proposition. So, in an effort to save money we’re planning on releasing the book through Print on Demand services such as MagCloud (for the magazine format and digital versions) and Blurb (for the hardcover print edition). Print on Demand will not only save on printing, warehousing, shipping and other production costs but also allow our book to be available on virtually every platform from book shelves to computer desktops to mobile devices.
Just pick a reward that suits you and be a part of our creative journey!
If you can’t help with the money, that’s okay! Just make sure to share this page (you can share using the tools right from this page), talk to friends about it and help us to raise support for the project!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>What is KIAF?</strong></p>
<p><br/>Kathmandu International Art Festival (KIAF) is a non-commercial triennale organized by the Siddhartha Arts Foundation. Each edition of the Festival focuses on contemporary arts' response to a particular social issue, with the objective of bringing<span style=""color: #ff0000;""> </span>awareness and engaging the audience at a personal level. <br/><br/>The 2nd Kathmandu International Art Festival, titled '<strong>Earth|Body|Mind'</strong>, will commence on the 25th of November and continue for month till the 21st  of December. Besides exhibiting <strong>92<span style=""color: #ff0000;""> </span></strong>artworks and performances by <strong>100</strong> artists from <strong>31</strong> countries, the Festival will host symposiums, educational tours, screenings, residencies, workshops and much more during its running.  </p>

<p><strong>Why Earth|Body|Mind?</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Nepal, a country primarily known for its geographic features and cultural heritage, is highly dependent on agriculture and its natural resources for the livelihood of its people. Nepal is also home to the third largest ice reserves in the world meaning almost one-third of the world's population is sustained on the water resources stemming from within our borders. As one of the most vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change (The Climate Change Index, ranked Nepal 4th on their list of countries most susceptible to Climate Change in 2010) we feel responsible and obliged to raise a voice. </p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Earth|Body|Mind</strong> recognizes the urgency of this problem, yet allows for a more encompassing reflection. It alludes to interconnectivity and how borad issues like environmental degradation, and climate change can be reflected through different perspectives.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Participating KIAF artists are presenting an aesthetic experience linking these three elements, to challange perspectives and educate viewers. </p>

<p><strong>Vision and Goals:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>KIAF aims to reach over 50,000 viewers, to actively engage citizens, communities, the government, various organizations and students in dialogues instigated by the theme of the Festival.</li>
<li>Over a dozen venues, locations and public spaces will house artworks and installations with a perfessionally curated arrangement. These spaces were chosen to maximize accessibility and the impact of the artwork. </li>

<p><strong>What you get in return?</strong></p>
<p>Given the theme of this year’s Festival, we wanted the rewards offered to not only be artistic and creative but environmentally friendly as well. Our pledge rewards will be made using recycled or recyclable materials. From postcards to calendars, all rewards will feature artwork created by participating artists.</p>
<p>On November 1st, KIAF will host a Printmaking Workshop in collaboration with Bindu: A Space for Artists (one of our supporting institutions), through which we hope to provide pledgers with memorable and significant tokens of our appreciation. Prints from the workshop will only be used for our fundraising campaign, meaning each one will be a limited edition artwork created by a Nepali artist just for you. We are also giving away merchandise designed and made by young art graduates. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our History</strong></p>
<p>The Festival started in 2009 with the mission <em>""to firmly place Nepal on the global map as a venue for the contemporary arts, allow for artistic collaborations and exchanges among international and local artists, and use art as a platform for critical reflection and the sensitization of society.""</em></p>
<p><strong>1st Kathmandu International Art Festival:</strong></p>
<p>The 1st KIAF was organized by the Siddartha Art Gallery and held between October 30<sup>th</sup>  and November 10<sup>th</sup>. Titled <strong>‘Separating Myth from Reality – Status of Women,’</strong> the festival was spread across six venues in the Kathmandu Valley. The 11-day Festival presented artworks by 111 artists from 25 countries. The festival also hosted a 3-day symposium to discuss issues raised by the Festival’s theme. It was inaugurated by a former Living Goddess (Kumari) Rashmila Shakya, who personified gender-typified roles in Nepali society.</p>
<p>For the augmented vision of the 2nd Festival, the Siddhartha Art Foundation was established (2011) to take it beyond the confines of a gallery</p>

What you get in return?
Given the theme of this year’s Festival, we wanted the rewards offered to not only be artistic and creative but environmentally friendly as well. Our pledge rewards will be made using recycled or recyclable materials. From postcards to calendars, all rewards will feature artwork created by participating artists.
On November 1st, KIAF will host a Printmaking Workshop in collaboration with Bindu: A Space for Artists (one of our supporting institutions), through which we hope to provide pledgers with memorable and significant tokens of our appreciation. Prints from the workshop will only be used for our fundraising campaign, meaning each one will be a limited edition artwork created by a Nepali artist just for you. We are also giving away merchandise designed and made by young art graduates. 
 
Our History
The Festival started in 2009 with the mission ""to firmly place Nepal on the global map as a venue for the contemporary arts, allow for artistic collaborations and exchanges among international and local artists, and use art as a platform for critical reflection and the sensitization of society.""
1st Kathmandu International Art Festival:
The 1st KIAF was organized by the Siddartha Art Gallery and held between October 30th  and November 10th. Titled ‘Separating Myth from Reality – Status of Women,’ the festival was spread across six venues in the Kathmandu Valley. The 11-day Festival presented artworks by 111 artists from 25 countries. The festival also hosted a 3-day symposium to discuss issues raised by the Festival’s theme. It was inaugurated by a former Living Goddess (Kumari) Rashmila Shakya, who personified gender-typified roles in Nepali society.
For the augmented vision of the 2nd Festival, the Siddhartha Art Foundation was established (2011) to take it beyond the confines of a gallery

My name is Wilfried Agricola de Cologne, German media artist and curator and creator of numerous international projects dealing with “art & moving images”.
A Virtual Memorial Vilnius 2013 is representing the manifestation of SFC – Shoah Film Collection-  my  international initiative for Peace and Reconciliation dealing with the Holocaust - as a cultural event in Lithuania standing under the Patronage of European Parliament, to take place between 23 September and 1 November 2013 at two venues – Jewish Cultural Center of Vilnius and Regional Museum of Kedainiai (a city close to Vilnius) Due to the current financial crisis, the small budget of  these hosting institutions are only able to realise a kind of minimum project constellation, while for the essential project components, e.g. the interventions, additional funding needs to be found via this funding campaign and your support: funding target $ 15.000.

The “Perks"" are representing a wonderful way, to thank all supporters individually in a very personal way and establish a relation between the project creator and the supporter. For the supporter, it is particularly attractive, that – depending on the Perk value - he can select between different types of art works by artists represented in Shoah Film Collection, like individual video art works on DVD, compilations of 3 or more art videos on one DVD, several photo and digital prints as individual works or edition (5-50), and even some original art works are available as gifts for an higher financial support.

About
On the symbolical date of 27 January 2010, 65th return of he Liberation of the Concentration Camp of Auschwitz -  I launched  SFC -Shoah Film Collection -  http://sfc.engad,org - an independent art project and international initiative addressed to young generations of artists and filmmakers to deal with the topic of Shoah (Holocaust) and collective trauma caused by totalitarianism by using new technologies and contemporary approaches in order to keep vivid the memory  through sensitizing via art. Each year on 27 January, a new call for the following year is released resulting meanwhile an outstanding collection of works of art & moving images, e.g. experimental and documentary art films and videos contributed by more than 50 artists from 14 countries. The deadline for 2013 has been extended to 31 July, thus SFC is still accepting submissions. Regulations and entryform an be found on http://www.nmartproject.net/netex/?p=1549
 In order the present this collection of film and videos to a wider audience, I created a special event structure named "" A Virtual Memorial - Commemorative Interventions"" – http://avmci.a-virtual-memorial.org to be hosted by  institutions of culture and art,  placing SFC - Shoah Film Collection in the context of complementary interventions like lectures, a symposium, international artists meeting, exhibitions, performances, artists presentations and talks, discussions and much more, in order to activate the artists and well as the audience. In this way, the project becomes an important international initiative for peace and reconciliation.
 In 2012, I realised the pilot project ""A Virtual Memorial Riga 2012"" http://riga2012.a-virtual-memorial.org  under the Patronage of the European Parliament in collaboration with Riga Ghetto and Latvian Holocaust Museum, the Culture Project and Latvian Videoart Archives NOASS Riga and the European funding context ""Artists for Change"" 1-30 June 2012, supported by the Latvian based embassies of USA, Sweden, Austria and Israel. The documentation can be reviewed online on http://ateamartistsforchange.wordpress.com/category/latvian-category/ With this crowdfunding campaign, I would like invite you to help me to realise the manifestation of SFC _ Shoah Film Collection in Lithuania as ""A Virtual Memorial Vilnius 2013"" – to take place between 23 September and 1 November 2013 - standing again under the Patronage of the European Parliament - a collaboration with Jewish Cultural Center Vilnius and the Regional Museum of Kedainiai (a city close to Vilnius).

The opening of the project is scheduled for the 23 September 2013, the national memorial day for the Lithuanian victims of the Holocaust, the inauguration of exhibitions featuring films and videos and their making of, photographs and digital graphics. The international artists’ meeting and symposium will take place on 24-27 September 2013, including screenings,  lectures, artists presentations and talks, discussions and other interventions like the performances by Doron Polak and Arturas Bumsteinas (Lithuanian sound artist). On 1 October, the project & the meeting of artists will move to the Regional Museum of Kedainiai, a former synagogue which was not destroyed by the Nazis, to be followed by the lectures, artists’ presentations and talks screenings and discussions on 2-4 October 2013.




Aims and target audience
For most people living these days, the Holocaust does not mean anything else than historical Past which does not affect them personally, at all. The project of Shoah Film Collection  and its manifestations would like to sensitize, motivate and activate people, in order to enable an identification, personal connection and affection by entering a new approach making them recognize that the Holocaust should  actually affecting everybody from the bottom of their heart, because it is representing in fact the most horrible manifestation of what we call the „dark side of human nature“, which may manifest itself in its lightest forms in most different ways already in everyone’s life in family, school and education through intolerance and discrimination, for instance.
 SFC _ Shoah Film Collection and its manifestations, and especially the most recent one in Vilnius/ Lithuania may be the cause to start or continue working on that the Holocaust and other crimes against humanity must not happen again. 


 

Why should this project be supported?
Because it is unique in its kind as an art project, because so many serious creative people are involved, because an artistic discussion about essential issues in art and life is needed, because the European Parliament is honouring this project realisation in Lithuania by taking Patronage speaking  - even if probably not for all Europeans -  but for the majority of them in any case, because the existence of man kind is requiring a re-thinking of human values, because we are one people, no matter on which continent under  which historical, political, economical, ethnic, cultural, religious conditions we are living, because the event in Lithuania will give thousands of positive signals, because it will make the future manifestation at other places possible……..
*Because in Greece there are now Neo-Nazis in the Parliament - *because it is good for artists to get there and meet in person with each other and have discussions with the public.
*Because a younger generation has no memory or historical knowledge of the holocaust
*Because Lithuania has an intensely anti-Semitic past, maybe present too, and i am very interested in showing my work there. (Annetta Kapon, USA)
""As new generations grow up, without personal experience of meeting witnesses, perpetrators or surviving victims of the Holocaust, we need to build new kinds of memorials, archives and create new artworks to continue and deepen the research of how the atrocities could ever be permitted to occur. Agricola de Cologne’s Shoah Film Collection is an important instance of such an institution. If the exhibition and archive, with all it represents, would not receive it’s rightful place within contemporary consciousness, it would be a great loss. This is a unique opportunity to discuss the ever-important issue of Holocaust with the Lithuanian public. Don’t let it be lost. You can help us realize SFC - Shoah Film Collection in Vilnius."" (Felice Hapetzeder, Sweden)
One of the reasons is because this project is not a commercial project and the artists involved are not represented by a commercial gallery. (Ariel Yannay Shani, Israel)
Because, for very personal reasons, that go far beyond the work that I shall be showing.
At the end of the 19th century, looking for a better life, wishing to escape the pogroms, an important part of the Jewish population left Lithuania for South Africa and founded a new community there. These are my origins, we are the ones who survived. During the war, my father and many other South African Jews returned to Europe in the Allied armies, to fight Nazism. Many other South African Jews took up the fight against Apartheid.
This event, the Shoah Film Collection in Vilnius, is important to commemorate those who were lost, but also to commemorate and celebrate us, the survivors, who refused to lie down and die, but who fight for a better, kinder, more generous world for all.(Joseph Rabie, France)

Because.... Humanity is cruel and stubborn. The Holocaust can never be commemorated enough. (T&NOK - Bannenberg &Snel, Netherlands)
Because.... the Holocaust should always be remembered as the biggest human crime.
Because…We say to all generations to come ""NEVER AGAIN""
Because …it is the worst historic fact in the last century, when Europe was already a well civilized country...(Dova Cahan ,Israel)
*Because it's important not to forget, - *because man usually repeat his mistakes,
*because history never teaches us how to be best, if we are not able to transform bad events into beauty (Isobel Bank, Italy)
             ""In no other place nor time did one witness a phenomenon so sudden and so complex: never were so many human lives extinguished in so little time, and with such an equally lucid mixture of technical intelligence, fanaticism, and cruelty"".--Primo Levi The Holocaust presents a profound challenge to memorialization. A group of international artists have created work as a way to preserve and honor the memory  of victims of the Holocaust. We have the opportunity for this work to be shown in Vilna in September 2013, where it will seize attention and attract debate to the new generations. We need your support to materialize this opportunity that will help to encourage awareness and remind us of the threat posed to us all when genocide and crimes against humanity are allowed to occur. (Alicia Felberbaum, UK)
The Shoah Film Collection is a vitally important series of media art works that collectively expresses the critical connections between art and historic memory. This is a collection that actively calls on generations to remember not only the atrocities of war but also requires us to consider how these inherited memories are translated into art. (Jay Needham, USA)


How will the raised funding be used?
The funding target of  $15 000 is representing just a kind of minimal budget, while in reality more than the double amount would be needed. The status of this project as a non-profit, internationally orientated media art project from Germany dealing with the Holocaust to be realised in Lithuania makes it difficult to raise any funding from anywhere.
One needs to consider, that due to the financial crisis the  Lithuanian institutions hosting this project are only able to provide a very small budget, which allows just the realisation of a kind of minimal constellation. After numerous of the Vilnius based embassies confirmed the financial support for artists to attend the project event, this project will be realised in any case in such a minimal constellation, while for the realisation of advanced essential components additional funding has to be raised via this crowdfunding campaign.

The fact, however, that the project realisation will take place in any case is of particular relevance for all those who would like to support this project, because already from the beginning there is the guarantee that each incoming cent will be used for the project realisation in Lithuania. 
After a community of artists is carrying this initiative together with me, from my point of view the best perspectives - also in terms of the aims as an international initiative for Peace and Reconciliation – are to get the international community of supporters on board which show simultaneously their solidarity that the Holocaust, genocides and other crimes against humanity, intolerance, discrimination, persecution and torture must not happen again. Never More!

According to the priority of the project realisation, the incoming money will be spent exclusively for the realisation of not yet financed project components, e.g.
1. the preparations in Cologne: print of a multilingual brochure and  leaflets in German, English and Lithuanian , print & preparations of the photographic, digital graphic, computer based works, films and videos  for the exhibitions in Vilnius (23. Sept – 1. November 2013) und Kedainai (1. Oktober – 1. November 2013), transport Cologne-Vilnius-Cologne,
2. preparations in Lithuania: (Vilnius/Kedainiai) installation of exhibitions: SFC – Shoah Film Collection, photographs and grafics, computer based multimedia works  - hiring technical and electronic equipment for the duration of the exhibitions, eg. projectors, DVD players, flatscreens, computers etc for the duration of the exhibitions. Performance: Doron Polak, Arthuras Bumsteinas and group: hiring of sound, light and electronic equipment, fees.
3. The remaining money will be used for covering expenses like meetings including international and local artists, accommodation and stay for artists etc. in Vilnius &  Kedainiai
If this funding target of  $15 000 should be exceeded, according to the priority some additional project components will be realised, e.g. 
4. inviting one or more additional artists for covering expenses like travel & accommodation, which was not possible until now, 5. including a third venue - the Museum Fort VII in Kaunas  (the first concentration camp on Lithuanian ground at the 2nd largest Lithuanian city) a potential partner, which would like to join, but has no budget at all, at least $ 4000  would be needed to cover the event expenses on 5 & 6 October 2013 – an international artists meeting including screenings, artists presentations and talks, discussions; 6. it is further intended to produce and print afterwards a catalogue documenting the project realisation in Lithuania, which is of particular relevance.


Who is standing behind the project?
  Hello, my name is Wilfried Agricola de Cologne ( you see me on the image above as the 2nd from the left, together with the SFC artists collegues attending A Virtual Memorial Riga 2012 - on the left standing Felice Hapetzeder, and on the right Eitan Vitkon, Shelley Jordon, Jay Needham, Ben Neufeld and Doron Polak), I am an interdisciplinary media artist and cúrator and initiator of  SFC _ Shoah Film Collection.

Final note:
The “Perks 
It is necessary to add a note concerning the serial art works like the artvideos and the photographic and digital prints. The artvideos are given to the supporters as copies, the supporter does not receive any rights on the work, he may use the video (s) for private use only. Any other use, for instance, public screening requires the expressive permission by the artist or owner of the respective work. The average price for the unlimited copy of an artvideo on the market is about 100 EURO ($ 132).
The serial prints are released on occasion of this campaign in special editions and different sizes and are all numbered and signed by the artist. The delivery of these “Perks” may take more time than usual, since the period of the project realisation within 6 weeks after the campaign deadline is very short.",20.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Indigenous Experience NW2013</h3>
<p>We here at Petite Taway inc. and  Ravenwolf NDN Arts are raising funds to produce an Indigenous Art show and much more in Portland, Oregon on May 30th, 2013.</p>
<p>A vision came between an emerging indigenous artist(TJ Ravenwolf AKA: Datson Teekkona) and a new company(Petite Taway inc., Deborah Newman) trying to break into the art scene while acknowledging the lack of presence and representation of the Indigenous community in Portland, Oregon.</p>
<p>The theme of  this year’s event is “<em>Medicine Within</em>” and focuses on the many ways we heal  ourselves, heal our families, and heal our communities by bringing forward our individual  (and/or collective) talents, skills, and trades . . . and by engaging our own  “Medicine Within.”</p>
<p>Deborah met TJ, in late 2011, and became his art representative in 2012. Deborah and TJ used art as a form of healing and growth the past year, to overcome major roadblocks in their lives. Trying to come up with ideas on how to create an art show for TJ, the idea of bringing in the community was integrated, so it not only became an art show, but an ""Indigenous Experience"". These ideas tried to solve these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to introduce, honor, and celebrate native art and culture to a new audience in the Portland area?</li>
<li>How to introduce  an emerging artist into the art market which has a huge disparity in native presence &amp; representaton?</li>
<li>With this  event how could we include, involve, and give back to the community? Having community exhibitor's bring and share their medicine.</li>
<li>How to integrate the spirit and medicine of the community into TJ's art show?</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus the vision of<strong> ""Indigenous Experience NW 2013 ""</strong> event was born. This event is a collaboration between: artists, musical performers, speakers, traditional storytellers, and exhibitors that would encourage the general public to interact and learn about local native culture. Traditional native food would also be available as part of the experience.</p>
<p>So May 30th, 2013 the event will take place and both Deborah and TJ hope that with the success of the event, events on the East coast(DC) and NW will happen on a yearly basis.</p>
<p>This vision of spirit with the hope of many healing journeys coming together that is becoming a reality in this world has NO corporate sponsership or funding from outside sources. The planning commitee and event staff are all volunteer's from the local community donating their time to support this endeavour.</p>
<p>This year we have as Musical performer's, four Native American Music Awards(NAMA) winners... *""Keith Secola"", *""Swil Kanim"", *""Cody Blackbird"", and *""Double Feature, Bigg B &amp; N8"", all backed by local/regional hero's the ""*Brain Harrison Trio"".</p>
<p>For the Speaker's we have the respected  *""Lillian Pitt"", *""Rick Bartow"", *""Charleen Touchette"", *""Phillip Archambeau"", *""Jubel Perkins"" and possibly a few more.</p>
<p>So far for Story Teller's we have the great *""Ed Edmo"" and are awaiting confirmation from others.</p>
<p>We have invited Many local community organizations to come and exhibit who they are and what the contribute to the community.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We must raise $7,000 to help pay for the the following:</p>
<p>*Scottish Rites Center venue(Ballroom and Auditorium).</p>
<p>*Fees/Honorariums, transportation, housing, meals of Performer's, Story Teller's, and Speaker's.</p>
<p>*Advertising/Marketing.</p>
<p>*Catering.</p>
<p>*Sound Reinforcement and equipment rentals.</p>
<p>*Audio/video production.</p>
<p>*Art, event, and stage material/construction displays. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This event could be seen as an artshow, a community fair, or a fesitval of some sorts... we have chosen to go with this all as an Indigenous ""Experience"".</p>
<p>The pulling together and inviting all arts, culture, and healing elements of the community to pray, celebrate, honor and heal to be present and say WE are here!  ALL under one roof in one night!</p>
<p>The funds raised here is soley for the production and inherent costs of this event. NONE of the funds will be for individual benefit or compensation. Part of the proceeds will go to benefit the Traditional Games Clinics in Portland, OR.</p>
<p>We here at Petite Taway inc., Ravenwolf NDN Arts, and the local volunteers are excited and ready! We hope to have your support! Thank you very much!</p>

<p><strong>ABOUT ME and MY BOOK:</strong></p>
<p>After such amazing and adventurous 5 years art journey I finally decided it's time to turn all my photos into unique thing - a beautiful art book. And I need your help to realise the photo book.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://martinstranka.com/strany/im/BookCover.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>My name is Martin Stranka. I am a self-taught professional photographer. My distinctive vision of photography etched as a unique space located in a balance and serenity, while my sophisticated images exists in that narrow space of a few seconds between dreaming and awakening.</p>
<p>During the last 3 years I have gathered over 40 international awards from different competitions including Professional Photographer of the Year, Sony World Photography Awards or International Photo Award.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>WHAT I NEED TO PUBLISH THE BOOK ?</strong></p>
<p>My goal is to publish a limited edition book. To do this I need to raise at least 8,000 EUR. The more money I raise the nicer the book can be. Many details during printing and binding separate a good book from a great book and I want this to be a great book. I am setting a goal of 8,000 EUR because this is what I think I am capable of raising.</p>
<p>The major risk in this project is not getting funded. Indiegogo is all or none, so if the 8,000 EUR goal isn't reached, I won't get any of the funding toward the books. I will need to place a bulk order in order to keep the costs low.</p>
<p>I want you to love this book as much as I do.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>HOW CAN YOU DONATE and GET YOUR OWN BOOK ?</strong></p>
<p>You can donate with your typical credit cards (Visa and Mastercard) or with PayPal account. So it is so easy for everyone :-) The Perks you get for your contribution are on the right side (8 grey rectangles). </p>
<p><span>If the 8,000 EUR goal isn't reached, all accumulated money will be immediately sent back to your account. So you can't lose anything.</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>HOW THE BOOK WILL LOOK LIKE ?</strong></p>
<p>I found an amazing book printer right here in Czech republic which published book for world known photographers, so I could not be luckier. They specialize in beautiful photography books, and I will be working with them one on one to create a high quality art book. It will be a hardcover gem that will really hold its own on bookshelves and coffee tables, and it will feature all of my favorite images from my last 5 years. All books will be numbered and personally signed as a limited edition. I plan to publish the book after this crowdfunding project.</p>
<p><em>Here is a book preview:</em></p>

<p>While the book itself will be the main goal and the reward for the  € 29 and higher levels, I am also offering a Collectors Box, small prints and beautiful museum archival grand prints up to 100x100cm from my <a href=""http://www.martinstranka.com/portfolio.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Portfolio"">portfolio</a>, personally signed and numbered (edition of 25).

WOW! Our fundraiser for “book I’M” reached it’s €8,000 goal. I wanted to extend a huge THANK YOU to everyone who donated, or helped spread the message!
BUT - you can still get your book copy here: http://www.martinstranka.com/book.html
 

 
ABOUT ME and MY BOOK:
After such amazing and adventurous 5 years art journey I finally decided it's time to turn all my photos into unique thing - a beautiful art book. And I need your help to realise the photo book.

My name is Martin Stranka. I am a self-taught professional photographer. My distinctive vision of photography etched as a unique space located in a balance and serenity, while my sophisticated images exists in that narrow space of a few seconds between dreaming and awakening.
During the last 3 years I have gathered over 40 international awards from different competitions including Professional Photographer of the Year, Sony World Photography Awards or International Photo Award.
More about my work: www.martinstranka.com
If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask me via my email: stranka.martin@gmail.com
And this is me :-)

 
WHAT I NEED TO PUBLISH THE BOOK ?
My goal is to publish a limited edition book. To do this I need to raise at least 8,000 EUR. The more money I raise the nicer the book can be. Many details during printing and binding separate a good book from a great book and I want this to be a great book. I am setting a goal of 8,000 EUR because this is what I think I am capable of raising.
The major risk in this project is not getting funded. Indiegogo is all or none, so if the 8,000 EUR goal isn't reached, I won't get any of the funding toward the books. I will need to place a bulk order in order to keep the costs low.
I want you to love this book as much as I do.
 
HOW CAN YOU DONATE and GET YOUR OWN BOOK ?
You can donate with your typical credit cards (Visa and Mastercard) or with PayPal account. So it is so easy for everyone :-) The Perks you get for your contribution are on the right side (8 grey rectangles). 
If the 8,000 EUR goal isn't reached, all accumulated money will be immediately sent back to your account. So you can't lose anything.
 
HOW THE BOOK WILL LOOK LIKE ?
I found an amazing book printer right here in Czech republic which published book for world known photographers, so I could not be luckier. They specialize in beautiful photography books, and I will be working with them one on one to create a high quality art book. It will be a hardcover gem that will really hold its own on bookshelves and coffee tables, and it will feature all of my favorite images from my last 5 years. All books will be numbered and personally signed as a limited edition. I plan to publish the book after this crowdfunding project.
Here is a book preview:

WHAT WILL YOU GET FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION ?
While the book itself will be the main goal and the reward for the  € 29 and higher levels, I am also offering a Collectors Box, small prints and beautiful museum archival grand prints up to 100x100cm from my portfolio, personally signed and numbered (edition of 25). Read more about each of these rewards to the right. If the 8,000 EUR goal is reached all rewards (all prints and collector's box) will be immediately sent at the end. All books will be sent immediately after publishing the book (during the second/third quarter of the year 2013).
Rewards Preview:
50x50cm (20x20in) museum archival print ""Rejected""
 
 
 Collector's Box (including 20 photos, signed and certified):

have you ever tried to imagine what <font color=""red"">red</font>
color does look like? Have you ever wondered how difficult it must be
for someone who never has and never will see any color?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>
Hello everyone!</p>
<p>
Thank you
for finding time to have a look at our campaign. 
</p>
<p>
Let's start with some numbers:</p>
<p>
<b>650,000,000 -</b> this is the approximate number of disabled
people living today</p>
<p>
<b>15%</b> of them declares painting and sculpturing to be their
passion</p>
<p>
<b>100,000,000</b> is the number of active disabled artists, whose
works have never seen the daylight</p>
<p>
Would you like to change it?</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>What is
our project about?</b></p>
<p>
Artots is the name that comes from Art of the Soul. I have been
working with disabled people for few years now. Before that I was not
aware how important role in their life plays the art. For many of
them this is the only way to communicate with the world, others feel
appreciated and needed. We have to remember that their financial
position is sometimes very difficult. There are countries around our
world were disabled people do not receive as much support as they
need.  Artots wants to change it. 
</p>
<p>
Our project is dedicated to all disabled
artists who want to manifest their talents and sometimes even just
presence. I have come to the conclusion that it is not enough to
organize a charity event where they can occasionally present and sell
their work. That helps only some of them without any regularity.
Artots online gallery is supposed to be the place where disabled
artists can display their work and sell it. They have proven to me
that there is no such term as “disabled” when it comes to art.
Let them prove it to the world as well! The main idea behind the
project is creating the possibility to gain finances for their
activity. Every one of them needs tools, sometimes especially 
designed for their needs. If they are given an opportunity to
sell their work regularly, they will be given a chance to continue
their work and enjoy their lives, regardless numerous turbulence they
have to face on daily basis. Disabled athletes
have their Para Olympics. Let's create Art Gallery for disabled
artists as well!</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>What is
our aim?</b></p>
<p>
It is very simple. <a href=""http://www.artots.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.artots.com</a>
will be the place where they can publish their work
to the world. It does not matter whether
 it is a painting, a sculpture or any other piece of art.
Regardless if the artists are using their mouth, feet or hands
to create, they will be capable of sharing their passions with
millions all around the world. This unique gallery will be the place
where they can also sell their work and earn money for further work
or medical treatment and physiotherapy -
Anything that can make their life better. Atrots
is a non-profit organization. Not a
single artist will be charged for displaying their work. All
money is kept by them. This is how we want to help. This is our way
of changing the world for better. At least one aspect of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><p>                        <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/260512/files/20131214082220-obrazek.jpg?1387038140"" src="""" style=""width: 400.3344481605351px; height: 300px;""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Can you
help?</b></p>
<p>
The money that we will gather will be spent on creating the fully
functioning online art gallery. So far we have created Beta Version
of our service, Facebook Application Beta Version and we also have
contacted the disabled artists and collected their work that will be
displayed and offered as our perks if you decide to help our project
become reality. Crowdfunding is the best method of
providing support for our ideas, moreover,
it makes people aware of the problem. 
</p>
<p>
If you can not support us financially we encourage you to spread the
project using social media and tell as many people as possible about
it. Any form of support means a lot for our artists. Together we can
give them the chance to defeat many barriers that make their life
even more difficult.  Please note that this project
is not just a Christmas event that will finish in January. Although
we have chosen to start our campaign before Christmas to give you the
chance to use your perks as Christmas e-cards which you can send to
your family and friends, this is a long term plan which will help
change the life of many for better. The main reasons we gather money
for are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
	the online service <a href=""http://www.artots.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.artots.com</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	the Facebook App <a href=""http://artots.com/facebookapp/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://artots.com/facebookapp</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	the marketing campaign</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	art tools for the artists</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	current expenses related to the gallery
	functioning</p>
</li>
</ul><p>
As you can see, we need quite a lot of money to
make it all happen. The exact breakdown is done below. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>What happens to the money?</b></p>
<p>
Just have a look on how much is possible with your help!
This estimation is based on the
real cost of every aspect of our initiative. 
</p>
<p>
We went for the Flexible Founding, here at Indiegogo. Every single
Dollar will be invested in our project. It depends on you guys how
much we can spend, how big percentage of our plan will be achieved.
So far we have spent our personal budget for the layout, Facebook
Application Beta Version and gathered the pieces of art from the
disabled artists. We still need to create the fully functioning
online service, Facebook Application final version and the mobile
Artots app. We need your help in order to make this all happen. The
artists need your help to make their lives better. Let's make future
worth waiting for all those who we can inspire! Let's appreciate
their efforts!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
If we gather …</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b>More than $125,000 </b>we will complete the online service, the
	Facebook App and the mobile version. The service will be available
	in 23 languages. It will be supported by the worldwide marketing
	campaign. Fully working and recognizable service will be operating
	in December 2014 and the FB App will be available in February 2015.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>More than $85,000</b>
	but less than the above, we will complete the online service, the
	Facebook App and the mobile version. The service will be available
	in 23 languages. It will be done the same time as above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>More than $55,000</b>
	but less than the above, we will complete the online service and the
	mobile version. The service will be available in 23 languages. It
	will be done the same time as above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>More than $45,000 </b>but
	less than the above, we will complete the online service available
	in 23 languages. It will be done in November 2014.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>More than $40,000</b>
	but less than the above, we will complete the online service
	available in English, German, French, Spanish and Polish. This money
	will cover the cost of creating and running it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>
<b>Less than
	$40,000</b>, we will provide
	art tools such as paint, paper, brushes, easels designed for
	disabled people and everything else, that such artist may require in
	order to create. This money will be enough to help 1000 artists. The
	due date for the dispatch of all goods is April 2014. Please note,
	that any extra money we have left, regardless the final amount, will
	also be donated for such cause. Let's help as much as we can!</p></li>

<li>
<p>Fully
	functional online gallery creation. It will be located at
	<a href=""http://www.artots.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.artots.com</a> and
	it will be a very special place where disabled people can display
	and sell their art.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	Facebook Application. Such application will be available to everyone
	who wants to display their paintings in Facebook. You
	will be able to share the paintings with all your friends in
	Facebook. <br/>Here is what it will look like: <a href=""http://artots.com/facebookapp/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://artots.com/facebookapp</a></p>
</li>
</ol><p>
</p><ol>
<p>
	3) Worldwide marketing campaign to make people aware of the new
	chance that has appeared. All disabled artists will be capable of
	presenting their art. If they only want, there will be no borders
	nor limits in their Art of the Soul promotion.</p>
</ol><p>
</p><p>
<b>What will it work like?</b></p>
<p>
We have many ideas about the way we would like the gallery to
operate. Here they are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
	Paintings will be available in electronic or traditional version.
	You can request any that you like to be done by the chosen artist
	with the chosen method. You can even request a painting to be done
	for your individual request. All electronic replicas will be
	available as .jpg files ready to put into the FB app, wallpapers,
	screensavers, e-cards, posters, paper and canvas replicas or
	original issues. Any .jpg image will be fully convertible to other
	formats so that transferring it to canvas was easy and manageable.
	All paintings come from limited collection. They are not an effect
	of any sort of mass production.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	Sculptures will be sold in their original form or made to order by
	the chosen artist.</p>
</li>
<li><p>
	All people who decide to support us
	financially will receive the unique code for their paintings as well
	as for their Certificate of the 21<sup>st</sup>
	Century Artots Patron of Art. Using your personal code you will be
	able to take part in discussion forums that will decide over the
	further Artots development. You will receive such authority by
	becoming Artots co-founder.</p></li>
</ol><p>
</p><p><b>Everybody is the

Here, at Artots we believe that every person involved in our activity

<p>
	Delivering perks 9 – 12 takes longer as they are not

	handwork. After you have decided to get one of them, we will notify
	you via email about it expected time of delivery.  Please note, the
	artist whose picture you have chosen will put a lot of effort to
	make this work a real masterpiece so that you could enjoy not only
	the picture itself, but the fact you have supported someone just as
	gifted as life experienced.

<b>What is the Certificate and how to become Artots Patron of Art?</b></p>
<p>Every
	co-founder, regardless the perk value receives Artots
	Patron of Art Certificate. Artots Patron of Art,who
	we also call The 21<sup>st</sup>
	Century Patron of Art, is any person of good will who decides to

<p>
</p><p>My
name is Maciek Szymanski. I am Polish. I am 25. I have been involved
in community actions for over 5 years now. In 2010 I was engaged with
active support for people who suffered from flood and lost their
life's achievements. I have also been helping all people who are
affected by diseases and have difficulties finding proper medical
assistance. I want to change the surrounding reality with a little
help from good people. I am not a foundation. I do not wish to gather
money to give it to the disabled. I wish to create a tool that will
generate income for them and inspire them for big things, which can
change their life for good. I spent all my money for this project as
I believe that together we can reach this ambitious target. The
disabled artists have shared their work with <b><a href=""http://www.artots.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.artots.com</a></b>
as their active participation in the project is what can make this
dream come true. It would not be possible without them. I would also
like to encourage all entrepreneurs, marketing agencies, IT
specialists, online auctions like e-bay to join our project. Any help
counts. Not only financial, although this is what we need to help
their being. Also a large Facebook community who will pass this
information to others makes a difference. If
you are an IT specialist, a marketing agency or you can simply help
in any technical aspect or wish to help us any other way, please
contact us.Any
symptom of support will be highly appreciated by the disabled
artists. Here are some of them:</p>

kid. He does not work. He finds his motivation in art. He lives of

rent and utilities. Please note that this are Polish rates. We are

have you ever tried to imagine what red

Hello everyone!

Thank you
for finding time to have a look at our campaign. 


Let's start with some numbers:

650,000,000 - this is the approximate number of disabled
people living today

15% of them declares painting and sculpturing to be their
passion

100,000,000 is the number of active disabled artists, whose
works have never seen the daylight

Would you like to change it?

What is
our project about?

Artots is the name that comes from Art of the Soul. I have been
working with disabled people for few years now. Before that I was not
aware how important role in their life plays the art. For many of
them this is the only way to communicate with the world, others feel
appreciated and needed. We have to remember that their financial
position is sometimes very difficult. There are countries around our
world were disabled people do not receive as much support as they
need.  Artots wants to change it. 


Our project is dedicated to all disabled
artists who want to manifest their talents and sometimes even just
presence. I have come to the conclusion that it is not enough to
organize a charity event where they can occasionally present and sell
their work. That helps only some of them without any regularity.
Artots online gallery is supposed to be the place where disabled
artists can display their work and sell it. They have proven to me
that there is no such term as “disabled” when it comes to art.
Let them prove it to the world as well! The main idea behind the
project is creating the possibility to gain finances for their
activity. Every one of them needs tools, sometimes especially 
designed for their needs. If they are given an opportunity to
sell their work regularly, they will be given a chance to continue
their work and enjoy their lives, regardless numerous turbulence they
have to face on daily basis. Disabled athletes
have their Para Olympics. Let's create Art Gallery for disabled
artists as well!

What is
our aim?

It is very simple. www.artots.com
will be the place where they can publish their work
to the world. It does not matter whether
 it is a painting, a sculpture or any other piece of art.
Regardless if the artists are using their mouth, feet or hands
to create, they will be capable of sharing their passions with
millions all around the world. This unique gallery will be the place
where they can also sell their work and earn money for further work
or medical treatment and physiotherapy -
Anything that can make their life better. Atrots
is a non-profit organization. Not a
single artist will be charged for displaying their work. All
money is kept by them. This is how we want to help. This is our way
of changing the world for better. At least one aspect of it.

                        

Can you
help?

The money that we will gather will be spent on creating the fully
functioning online art gallery. So far we have created Beta Version
of our service, Facebook Application Beta Version and we also have
contacted the disabled artists and collected their work that will be
displayed and offered as our perks if you decide to help our project
become reality. Crowdfunding is the best method of
providing support for our ideas, moreover,
it makes people aware of the problem. 


If you can not support us financially we encourage you to spread the
project using social media and tell as many people as possible about
it. Any form of support means a lot for our artists. Together we can
give them the chance to defeat many barriers that make their life
even more difficult.  Please note that this project
is not just a Christmas event that will finish in January. Although
we have chosen to start our campaign before Christmas to give you the
chance to use your perks as Christmas e-cards which you can send to
your family and friends, this is a long term plan which will help
change the life of many for better. The main reasons we gather money
for are:



	the online service www.artots.com




	the Facebook App http://artots.com/facebookapp



	the marketing campaign



	art tools for the artists



	current expenses related to the gallery
	functioning


As you can see, we need quite a lot of money to
make it all happen. The exact breakdown is done below. 




What happens to the money?

Just have a look on how much is possible with your help!
This estimation is based on the
real cost of every aspect of our initiative. 


We went for the Flexible Founding, here at Indiegogo. Every single
Dollar will be invested in our project. It depends on you guys how
much we can spend, how big percentage of our plan will be achieved.
So far we have spent our personal budget for the layout, Facebook
Application Beta Version and gathered the pieces of art from the
disabled artists. We still need to create the fully functioning
online service, Facebook Application final version and the mobile
Artots app. We need your help in order to make this all happen. The
artists need your help to make their lives better. Let's make future
worth waiting for all those who we can inspire! Let's appreciate
their efforts!


If we gather …



More than $125,000 we will complete the online service, the
	Facebook App and the mobile version. The service will be available
	in 23 languages. It will be supported by the worldwide marketing
	campaign. Fully working and recognizable service will be operating
	in December 2014 and the FB App will be available in February 2015.



More than $85,000
	but less than the above, we will complete the online service, the
	Facebook App and the mobile version. The service will be available
	in 23 languages. It will be done the same time as above.



More than $55,000
	but less than the above, we will complete the online service and the
	mobile version. The service will be available in 23 languages. It
	will be done the same time as above.



More than $45,000 but
	less than the above, we will complete the online service available
	in 23 languages. It will be done in November 2014.



More than $40,000
	but less than the above, we will complete the online service
	available in English, German, French, Spanish and Polish. This money
	will cover the cost of creating and running it.


Less than
	$40,000, we will provide
	art tools such as paint, paper, brushes, easels designed for
	disabled people and everything else, that such artist may require in
	order to create. This money will be enough to help 1000 artists. The
	due date for the dispatch of all goods is April 2014. Please note,
	that any extra money we have left, regardless the final amount, will
	also be donated for such cause. Let's help as much as we can!
What do you support?


Fully
	functional online gallery creation. It will be located at
	www.artots.com and
	it will be a very special place where disabled people can display
	and sell their art.



	Facebook Application. Such application will be available to everyone
	who wants to display their paintings in Facebook. You
	will be able to share the paintings with all your friends in
	Facebook. Here is what it will look like: http://artots.com/facebookapp




	3) Worldwide marketing campaign to make people aware of the new
	chance that has appeared. All disabled artists will be capable of
	presenting their art. If they only want, there will be no borders
	nor limits in their Art of the Soul promotion.


What will it work like?

We have many ideas about the way we would like the gallery to
operate. Here they are:



	Paintings will be available in electronic or traditional version.
	You can request any that you like to be done by the chosen artist
	with the chosen method. You can even request a painting to be done
	for your individual request. All electronic replicas will be
	available as .jpg files ready to put into the FB app, wallpapers,
	screensavers, e-cards, posters, paper and canvas replicas or
	original issues. Any .jpg image will be fully convertible to other
	formats so that transferring it to canvas was easy and manageable.
	All paintings come from limited collection. They are not an effect
	of any sort of mass production.



	Sculptures will be sold in their original form or made to order by
	the chosen artist.


	All people who decide to support us
	financially will receive the unique code for their paintings as well
	as for their Certificate of the 21st
	Century Artots Patron of Art. Using your personal code you will be
	able to take part in discussion forums that will decide over the
	further Artots development. You will receive such authority by
	becoming Artots co-founder.

Everybody is the
winner!


Here, at Artots we believe that every person involved in our activity
is the winner. From the very beginning they make a contribution into
making this project successful. Here is the benefit breakdown:
FAQ:What are your perks?Perks are the paintings.




How long does it take to receive my perk?


	All perks 1 – 9 will be  delivered within 1 to 5 days. We will not
	be waiting for the campaign to finish. You will receive a link which
	will take you to the download section instantly.

	Delivering perks 9 – 12 takes longer as they are not
	„manufactured”. These are the effect of a disabled artist's
	handwork. After you have decided to get one of them, we will notify
	you via email about it expected time of delivery.  Please note, the
	artist whose picture you have chosen will put a lot of effort to
	make this work a real masterpiece so that you could enjoy not only
	the picture itself, but the fact you have supported someone just as
	gifted as life experienced. 
	



What is the Certificate and how to become Artots Patron of Art?
Every
	co-founder, regardless the perk value receives Artots
	Patron of Art Certificate. Artots Patron of Art,who
	we also call The 21st
	Century Patron of Art, is any person of good will who decides to
	contribute into our idea implementation. Such person has proven
	their concern for the disabled artists fate and wants to help them
	create a place where they could enjoy their lives the way they
	appreciate it the most. All of you can become the Artots Patron of
	Art. 
	




What is the unique code?It
	is the unique number for every single Artots co-founder. Each
	picture, certificate or card has been given this unrepeatable
	number. You can be certain that each image you have received is
	unique, original and it will last forever in the history of modern
	art. On top of that the number will also allow for expressing
	yourself in special co-founders' forum which has been designed so
	that all of us could decide over www.artots.com
	development's path.



How do you know which perk I want and how I want it to be made?



It
	is simple! All details of the chosen perk will have to be specified
	in an email sent to: info@artots.com

	Here are few examples of possible options:*
	After
	choosing your perk you need to email us with the perk's ID which you
	can find at www.artots.com
	and tell us the email address you want to have it sent to. 
	
	* Also if it is a paper or canvas replica you will have to tell us
	the exact address for the delivery. 
	
	* If you choose an e-card you need to tell us which one it was. 
	
	* If you choose the wishes from our gallery you will have to tell us
	the wishes number. 
	
	* If you want to have your own wishes on the card, please email them
	to us and we will place it on your card.





How much are the shipment costs and where do you deliver?

	No matter where you are from, we will deliver your perk without any
	extra charges. We fully appreciate your support to our action,
	therefore, we do not see any reason to charge you extra for the act
	of good will.



Limited collection paintings. Where do they come from?
Those
	paintings come directly from the disabled artists. It was their
	input into www.artots.com
	development.



Which electronic format my paintings will be delivered in?
It
	will be .jpg format ready to place your picture in your FB gallery.
	What is more, if we gather $85,000 we will create special FB
	application which will allow for convenient management of your own
	21st century FB art gallery. You
	will receive a link which will help you download the package with
	your paintings, cards and the certificate. It will be delivered to
	your email address.



In
	case of any further questions we will be happy to answer them asap
	via email.You
	may also look for further info on our web site www.artots.com
	and follow us on Facebook. In case of any doubts, please do not

<p></p>
<p>We
are a group of 18 young designers in the Class
of 2015 in the College of Fine Arts at the University of Texas - Austin. We have dedicated one of our design classes
this semester to creating this publication which showcases 18 unique
perspectives of different cultures within Austin. We have spent the last two
years together, honing our design skills and becoming a tight-knit group that
strives to learn from each other. We have a wide variety of design interests
but our collaboration has brought us closer together and allowed us to create
something unique that would have been impossible to do on our own. We hope to
share this publication throughout Austin and beyond as a way of showcasing our
individual work, and more importantly the city we love.</p>

512stew is a book showcasing 18 unique
perspectives of different cultures within Austin. In the past there  have been songs, movies, and photographs inspired
by the city. But as young designers who live and breathe Austin we had the
opportunity to delve deeper than the surface – we had the opportunity to have intimate
one-on-one experiences and show Austin’s wonderfully diverse nature. Austin’s
diversity is reflected in the book itself as we all developed our own unique
understanding of these different cultures, as well as our own styles – we have
everything – from video to photography, paintings to graphic design </span></p>

Austin and honing our design skills. We are hoping to celebrate Austin in a way

512stew is a book showcasing 18 unique
perspectives of different cultures within Austin. In the past there  have been songs, movies, and photographs inspired
by the city. But as young designers who live and breathe Austin we had the
opportunity to delve deeper than the surface – we had the opportunity to have intimate

Through
exploring individual definitions of “culture” in Austin we are showcasing
Austin and honing our design skills. We are hoping to celebrate Austin in a way
that is unlike a typical publication, as our 18 perspectives will provide you
with an in-depth and unique view of this wonderful city.
The book is divided into sections of 12-20 pages dedicated each designer. Below are examples of some of the page spreads:

Amanda Czarnik— Religion is…

Mimi Richardson—Brew



Laura Levisay—Dog Blog 



Daniel Shipley—Austin by Perspectives

Each section will have a unique introduction page which includes ""keyword ingredients"" for their stew:

If you want to understand us, then we're on the right site.</p><p>Hi, my &gt;artist&lt; name is Clever Fox; my cohort is &gt;artist name&lt; Lotus Vine. We've been friends for several years and room together in a smallish apartment; I found living on my own wasn't as easy as I'd hoped. During this time, we started developing stories together, just random little things, no big deal. Lotus designs her own costumes and clothes and cosplays original characters that are amazingly real-feeling because of the time and thought she put into each of them to make them each unique, and she's lamented about not having the space for the right equipment to really shine. I've gotten by easier: I'm an artist. I literally need a table and a pencil and I'm good to go. So in our limited space, between rearranging everything to make way for two artsy people, I began drawing her characters or seeing drawings from others of them and she fell in love with my art style and started bragging to some friends. I was tempted to dabble in being a commission artist for conventions, but had no idea where to start, and as much as everyone has said yes, I don't want to be just commission work, and she doesn't want to be just another one making small tails and paws for people in a hall full of them.</p><p>Maybe we have big aspirations, but when we started doing a gag comic based on a roleplay we did with some friends, it ended up flowing very smoothly; it doesn't have many fans yet and we didn't want to leak the personal information present in the text, so we cancelled it prematurely as an art demo. Then we started playing again. For whatever reason, we sat down and wondered to ourselves ""If we could make our own, completely original Pokémon region to pitch to Nintendo, what would it be?"" Now, that's not to say we're asking for bribe money here! Not even close! While we developed a theme and the Pokémon, they came alive, much more than we'd ever intended. I began purchasing (expensive) markers to color with and she started playing with resin casting and needle felting models of them just for fun.</p><p>Five months passed, working almost every day. We were making something. Her costumes stopped, and my original comics ceased, while this took over everything we had time for. When it became clear this could be a legitimate thing, we sought advice from some friends who thought the concept would be great as a Pokémon game, bus as neither of us work for Nintendo and they supposedly have enough on their plates to deal with, we took off on the principal that, though Pokémon is trademarked, the concept of ""find creature, catch creature, fight with creature"" isn't so we launched into the way of changing this Pokémon spin off into our own story, our own idea. Yes, it'll look a lot like Pokémon, I'll say that now, but what we really want to get across is the message and story, not the principal it's based on.</p><p>We needed a name to work under. Clever Fox Studios and Lotus Vine Creations, both still-dead pages buried on DeviantArt, needed to come together to ensure proper rights for what we were doing. We had a lot of projects together, a lot of possibility. But how? I always enjoy drawing unique characters more than pre-existing ones because it's less pressure to be correct; she has the same mentality for OC costume. No one can say you're wrong, which is a huge relief on its own. By pitching back and forth on the principals of storyboard, character and design, how to not Godmode and stay interesting, we came up with ""Original Character Concept Creations"" then Lotus blurted out (it was in reference to herself since she is 85% of the think-tank between us, I just use pretty colors) ""I am O-C-C-C, I'm OC^3 (cubed)!"" and we grabbed that and made it our joint title. It stuck, it worked... now what? We could put ""Insert Title Here"", our RP comic, under it since we both worked on it, then we started posting our Fakemon designs. People like them well enough, but now that we're running them under than banner ""Crystal Capture Creatures"" or ""C-Cube"" as the flagship of our business, we realize we need money in order to have time.</p><p>So much happens in life, let me tell you. Between rent, a car accident, Lotus needing corrective eye surgery and both of us working the same bleh job (anyone who knows the feels, raise your hand) and so much emotional duress, we barely have time to eat and sleep. We want--no, NEED--out. We want to work for ourseves, to bring our stories to life, to be known for our skills and love of creating, not our customer service. Again, we're lowballing at 5k just to see if we're considered a worthy cause, but the idea of being able to make a living doing what we want is a dream everyone has the right to pursue, right? If you need further convincing, please check out our referred DeviantArt pages under Clever Fox Studios or Lotus Vine Creations to see our baby slowly hatching.</p><p>Anyone that draws knows it's time-consuming and messy, and anyone that costumes knows that's even more so. Our jobs (health problems related to work stress aside) don't pay enough to be able to shift focus to a new business alone. We need supplies and the money to make time, and anything helps. Printers, markers, lead, paper, fabric, felt, wool, needles, resin and TIME--we need it, and in exchange we want to hopefully entertain you donors, patrons and future-fans, by bringing something fun, exciting and meaningful to the world. Though not every project we make will be piloted under the banner of OC^3, everything we gather will be put toward gathering the supplies we need to get the gravy train rolling as we slowly try to transfer to being full- or mostly-time artists. That's why everything counts, even if it's just publicity. Anything, really. Likes, favorites, a dollar, a mention to someone that likes Pokémon, Digimon or Yokai Watch. We want to do this.</p><p>Hit up Lotus for costumes, ideas, stories or encouragement. Hit me up for prints and commissions. Anything given will go into the OC^3 pool and used to further OC^3 and ""C-Cube"". Later on, maybe individual projects under Lotus Vine and Clever Fox? We'll even give a list at the end of projects both of us are working on or potential ideas for anyone reading this. If you think this is a cry for help, you're half right, but I can promise I'm not exaggerating.</p><p>We'll be hitting up conventions in our area as well, hopefully starting this year and every year after, so if you want a personal look I'll be at Anime NebrasCon 2016, hopefully at my own booth with another friend, piloting Clever Fox and OC^3 art. Next year we'll be shooting for an actual OC^3 booth for both of us. If you want to start picking favorites, the first rounds of color beta images are on our DeviantArt pages, and the first comic will be out in the next few weeks.</p><p>UPDATE05/24/2016: We've decided that the creature will be called creastals (creatures+crystals) (KREE-stahlz) and that our equivalent to ""shiny"" will be ""mirage"".

Because that's what we see and we want all artists to continue working and creating and bringing their visions to you, wherever you live. We're not just raising money for this one artist. We're raising money for a group of artists. Working artists that want to continue creating beautiful things for you to enjoy, need your support in order to get their work into the public eye. <br/><br/>We
 only need $2,000 to build the foundation for our nest egg. From that we
 can fund several artists at a time so they can participate in their 
communities. Each donation you make, no matter how small, or how large 
will put us closer to adding art to your community, or one nearby.<br/><h3>How Will Your Contribution Impact the Art Community?<br/>
</h3>Think
 for a moment what your world would be like without the beauty of art. 
Art broadens the mind and stretches the limbs beyond possibilities to 
the impossibilities. Art offers the opportunity to think on a different plane
 and to consider new ideas that might not occur to you otherwise. 
Thought provoking, stimulating and beautiful. A community without art 
may never live up to, or even come close to it's potential. <br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span><h3>Our Story</h3>Welcome to Donors for Art! We got started on this campaign in a most unusual way. It didn't start out as a project, but with time and understanding, it became one. We hope it will become something you'll get behind and support because we need people just like you!<br/><br/>A group of friends got together and created Open Call Group on Facebook after realizing there were enough open calls for artists to support an entire group. Elizabeth Musgrove Hanlin designed the group as a place to share open calls for artwork submissions, all in one place, so that artists looking for a gallery, a show or an installation venue to show their work, could apply for the openings, across the country, suited to their art medium. Each one of the original members added their own friends that they knew produced art in some form. Then those friends added their friends. To date, we have 67 members in all mediums of the art world, from sculpture to music, and it's still growing.<br/><br/>Open calls come from all over. It could be a community looking for beautification or a gallery with open space available. They put out open calls asking for participants to submit their work for the open space. Thousands of artists answer these calls everyday. Submission usually requires an application that gives the artist's background and details and a way for the artist to show what they have to offer. Most open calls for artists also have a fee attached to them. It's usually between $20 to $70 to cover administrative costs to the art venue. Many art venues are 501c3, non-profit organizations, so this fee is a necessary part of their world and it's what assists them in bringing new and interesting art to your town and community. <br/><br/>When we began posting open calls with fees, the feedback we received from the artists was to find more open calls that were free submissions because the cost of the fees was not always in their budgets. Unfortunately, not many of those exist. So how do we continue to submit art to venues when our artists can't afford the fees?<br/><br/>The answer is a simple one.

Because that's what we see and we want all artists to continue working and creating and bringing their visions to you, wherever you live. We're not just raising money for this one artist. We're raising money for a group of artists. Working artists that want to continue creating beautiful things for you to enjoy, need your support in order to get their work into the public eye. We
 only need $2,000 to build the foundation for our nest egg. From that we
 can fund several artists at a time so they can participate in their 
communities. Each donation you make, no matter how small, or how large 
will put us closer to adding art to your community, or one nearby.How Will Your Contribution Impact the Art Community?
Think
 for a moment what your world would be like without the beauty of art. 
Art broadens the mind and stretches the limbs beyond possibilities to 
the impossibilities. Art offers the opportunity to think on a different plane
 and to consider new ideas that might not occur to you otherwise. 
Thought provoking, stimulating and beautiful. A community without art 
may never live up to, or even come close to it's potential. Our StoryWelcome to Donors for Art! We got started on this campaign in a most unusual way.

promote knowledge and debate on several levels. Visitors will be invited
 to consider the major themes running through these works, such as the 
significance and legacy of the Ottoman Empire and colonialism, the 
intricacies and history of contemporary conflicts, responses to all 
types of violence, and the strength of the voices of those facing it. </p><p>Autonomy
 of Self seeks to encourage understanding of the power of those deemed 
powerless, and to encourage knowledge and debate around the political 
and visual representation of those facing the consequences of global 
politics. </p>The show calls for the audience to revaluate 
understanding of human rights by exploring how individuals are 
responding to a lack of them, caused by their state or statelessness. It also draws attention to how the lens operates as a democratic tool.<br/><br/><p><b>All the artworks will be documented and the 
events will be recorded so that as much as possible of Autonomy of Self 
will be made available online.</b></p><br/><p><br/></p><p></p><h2><b>What We Need and What You Will Get<br/></b></h2><p>We are fundraising for the production costs of the exhibition and we need your generous 
donations to help us carry out this exceedingly important exhibition. There are a multitude of exciting rewards that we have put together for 
you, and any funds we make beyond our target will go towards our Public Events Programme. (Read more about these events at the bottom of the page).</p><p><b>Your kind donations will be spent as follows:</b></p><p>Printing Costs - £2,700<br/></p><p>Wall building (1 sculpture and 4 video instalations, construction, panel hire and removal)- £4,000</p><p>Website design - £600<br/></p><p>Video Production - £500<br/></p><p>Shipping - £100<br/></p><p>Lighting - £350</p><p>Transport - £300<br/></p><p>Audio Visual support - £1,000<br/></p><p>Paint, nails and related supplies - £500<br/></p><p>Vinyls for wall captions and front windows - £700<br/></p><p>Translation - £250</p><p><b>Total - £11,000</b><br/></p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></h2><p>Our challenge is to raise the full funds in time for the opening on October the 23rd. We are applying for a variety of grants, funds and donations, and P21 Gallery has a strong track record of success doing so. In the extremely unlikely event of funds not being raised in time, the exhibition will simply be rescheduled, and your funds will not go to waste.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></h2>If you would like to help us achieve our goal in other ways then please share our fund on social media!<p>

the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. De Bernieres will read an extract from this novel in which he
explores the rounding up and removal of the Armenian community through the eyes of his
characters.

""For political oppositions, democratic representation merges with 
visual representation. For people, possessing political agency means 
possessing the ability to be seen, not only heard""- Lina Khatib, Image Politics in the Middle East
Opening April 16th 2015P21 Gallery, London, Kings Cross                                      The ConceptAutonomy of Self unites individuals contending with conflicts across Eastern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa in their shared history through the Ottoman Empire. Conflicts in Bosnia, Crimea, Armenia, Lebanon, Palestine, Iraq, Egypt and Tunisia are considered in the artworks. Each has faced the consequences of the collapse of the Empire and the destruction of interventions from the UK, US, France and Russia, and the implications of these actions resonate in the identity of these countries today. The exhibition is inspired by, and a response to the writings of theorist Ariella Azoulay.The Artists

Aims and GoalsThis exhibition aims to encourage and 
promote knowledge and debate on several levels. Visitors will be invited
 to consider the major themes running through these works, such as the 
significance and legacy of the Ottoman Empire and colonialism, the 
intricacies and history of contemporary conflicts, responses to all 
types of violence, and the strength of the voices of those facing it. Autonomy
 of Self seeks to encourage understanding of the power of those deemed 
powerless, and to encourage knowledge and debate around the political 
and visual representation of those facing the consequences of global 
politics. The show calls for the audience to revaluate 
understanding of human rights by exploring how individuals are 
responding to a lack of them, caused by their state or statelessness. It also draws attention to how the lens operates as a democratic tool.All the artworks will be documented and the 
events will be recorded so that as much as possible of Autonomy of Self 
will be made available online.What We Need and What You Will GetWe are fundraising for the production costs of the exhibition and we need your generous

Exploring Armenia, with Louis de Bernieres, Nouritza Matossian and Armenoui Kasparian Saraidari





                   Louis de Bernieres is an internationally acclaimed best-selling author, best known for his novel
Captain Corelli’s Mandolin. In 2004 he published his ‘magnum opus’ (-British Library), Birds
Without Wings, which explores the impact of war through the eyes of a small Turkish town during
the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. De Bernieres will read an extract from this novel in which he
explores the rounding up and removal of the Armenian community through the eyes of his
characters.

					Armenoui Kasparian Saraidari is exhibiting her artworks on the Armenian genocide and exodus
within the exhibition, and will lead the conversation
with de Bernieres to explore his writing and the recording and accounting of memory associated
with the genocide. 
The event will then be open to a Q&A, and followed by acclaimed writer and director of the Armenian Institute Nouritza Matossian, who will present her film 'Heart of Two Nations: Hrant Dink'. The film records conversations between herself and journalist Hrant Dink who was assassinated in Turkey in 2007.



	
Screening of '1395 Days Without Red' by Šejla Kamerić, courtesy of Artangel
An elegant young woman makes her way through an empty city. At every crossing she stops, looks and listens. Should she wait or should she run? Should she wait for others or take the risk on her own?The city is Sarajevo, and the route the woman takes became known as Sniper Alley during the siege of the city endured by its citizens for 1395 days between 1992 and 1996. The woman, played by Spanish actress Maribel Verdú, is reliving the experience of the trauma of the siege. It is her individual journey through the collective memory of the city.The Siege of Sarajevo lasted for 1395 days. The citizens were bright colours, for fear of alerting their movements to the snipers watching from the hills above.

<p>I fell in love with an artist from New York. We’ve been collaborating artistically ever since. Though we’re only able to see each other months at a time, our relationship has grown into one of my most meaningful friendships. Although we grew up in very different places culturally, artistically and aesthetically we are travelers on the same journey. The greatest challenge we have encountered is traveling across borders. While she can travel to Porto, the economic differences between our countries do not afford me the same opportunity. </p>
<p>Since leaving high school, I have been working as a tattoo designer and artist at a historic Barbearia in Porto’s City Center. I am completely self-taught want to research and broaden my craft to reflect my growth as a multinational artist. I have been directly inspired by the life and aesthetics of New York’s culture and hope to create a unique brand and style to share with the world. I also seek to be a cultural ambassador for my city.</p>
<p>Porto has seen a surge in tourism and as a result our city is changing rapidly. I want to preserve what is unique and beautiful about my city and my culture. Through my art I would like to share the magic that courses through the cobblestone streets of Porto, from the joyous celebrations of Sao Joao festival to the nostalgic romance of Fado music.</p>
<p>We have a rich history and lineage of story telling through our tile-work, music, architecture and decorative arts. I seek to carry on this tradition and I am proud of my heritage as a Portuguese artist. I feel a responsibility to uphold these cultural practices while also expanding and evolving what it means to be a Portuguese artist. </p>

We’ve been collaborating artistically ever since. Though we’re only able to see each other months at a time, our relationship has grown into one of my most meaningful friendships. Although we grew up in very different places culturally, artistically and aesthetically we are travelers on the same journey. The greatest challenge we have encountered is traveling across borders. While she can travel to Porto, the economic differences between our countries do not afford me the same opportunity. 
Since leaving high school, I have been working as a tattoo designer and artist at a historic Barbearia in Porto’s City Center. I am completely self-taught want to research and broaden my craft to reflect my growth as a multinational artist. I have been directly inspired by the life and aesthetics of New York’s culture and hope to create a unique brand and style to share with the world. I also seek to be a cultural ambassador for my city.
Porto has seen a surge in tourism and as a result our city is changing rapidly. I want to preserve what is unique and beautiful about my city and my culture. Through my art I would like to share the magic that courses through the cobblestone streets of Porto, from the joyous celebrations of Sao Joao festival to the nostalgic romance of Fado music.
We have a rich history and lineage of story telling through our tile-work, music, architecture and decorative arts. I seek to carry on this tradition and I am proud of my heritage as a Portuguese artist. I feel a responsibility to uphold these cultural practices while also expanding and evolving what it means to be a Portuguese artist. 
Please donate how ever much you can to help me in my journey across the Atlantic (no amount is too large or too small)! If you choose to donate, you will already be a part of my art, my journey, and my dream. Ultimately, I just want to share love, and I believe that we are all connected.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Dalton Bissell and I am an artist in the Pacific Northwest of the USA. I have a great passion for the outdoors, often loving to hike and explore the Cascades. Much of my art is influenced by the incredible examples of nature that humble me with their beauty everyday.</p>
<p>When I am stuck inside working, my spinning tops are a breath of fresh air for me. They are a very welcome distraction from the stresses of life. I want to share the these wonderful little works of art with everyone!</p>
<p>Today I will be sharing The Hive Top with the world in the hope that I can make it a better and more beautiful place for us all to live. To that end, I will be donating a portion of the proceeds to sponsoring live beehives across the world. If the bees disappear, many of the things I love about the great outdoors will vanish with them!</p>
<p>Bees are facing a rapid decline in many areas of the world because of harmful commercial practices like insecticides. Just ""bee-ing"" aware of whats happening to them is half of the battle, so spread the word so we can take care of our little flying friends! After all, the busy pollinators take care of you all the time.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Get With Your Contribution</h3>
<p>For every top that is sold I am going to donate $5 to sponsoring beehives. </p>
<p>For your contribution you get a steel Hive Top with a 3 mm ruby contact point. The steel is durable while the ruby is incredibly smooth and scratch resistant. This makes for one good-looking top as well. </p>
<p>A successful campaign for me would be $500, which is just a few tops. It's also enough for me to sponsor a single beehive. If this happens, I should actually be saying ""For <u><i>all of us</i></u> to sponsor a beehive <u><i>together</i></u>"". Maybe lots of them! I am filled with hope and excitement at the possibility.</p>
<p>If my campaign is wildly successful, I will use the funds to buy new tools and equipment for my workshop. This will allow me to make more intricate works of art and to work with exciting new materials. It may be even bring down the cost of manufacturing. I would love to offer several material choices like Brass or Titanium as well.</p>
<p>A successful campaign would make a big difference in the daily struggle to not be the starving artist and help me to create another work of art that I can be proud of.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Contributing to this campaign will not only be helping out the bees in a small way, it will be helping a small artist work towards his dreams. Independent and self employed, I am 26 and determined to spend the rest of my life creating art for a living. For the next 75 years, I hope to cause meaningful and beautiful change with my art. I'll be starting with just 1 beehive. Wish me luck!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>One of the real risks I face is in shipping. There are all sorts of problems that can occur when shipping a small, valuable product like this one. The main concern is making sure that the package arrives and is undamaged on arrival. With tracked shipments I can assure safe arrival, and if the top is damaged in anyway I am prepared to replace the top for you, just send it back and a replacement will be on the way.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you want to help out the campaign but don't have the funds to contribute, that is just fine! Like I said earlier, just knowing about it is half the battle... so spread the word! Use the Indiegogo share tools to share my campaign with your friends on Facebook or Twitter. </p>
<p>Do you want to help the Bees even more? Then check out this extremely informative youtube video called ""Bee Informed"" and be just that. <a href=""https://youtu.be/9gASaI8F4cs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://youtu.be/9gASaI8F4cs</a></p>

</div></div>","What is OuterSpace?OuterSpace is a contemporary art gallery (housed in a customized cube van). A small, personal exhibition space with a reach not accessible by brick and mortar galleries. The flexibility of the gallery allows for pop-up shows and honest immersion within the community. The gallery currently resides on the West Coast of Canada, in the capital city Victoria.The OuterSpace mobile gallery was built and funded by Ryan Thompson over the course of a year and launched in 2013 with two exhibitions. *Above - (Left) 6 months into the project, engine work and government safety inspections complete, entire truck stripped to the bones and ready to build. Feeling a little in over our head... (Right) After 12 months our first show!Our first exhibition ""Here & There"", paintings and circuit bent instrument by James Kirkpatrick.Our second exhibition ""The Many Faces of Koyama Press"" a show highlighting the beautiful art books & comics published by Annie Koyama. The show featured artwork by Patrick Kyle, Jesse Jacobs, Luke Ramsey, Tin Can Forest, Alex Schubert and Allister Lee.The development of OuterSpace happened out of necessity due to the lack of outlets for artist books and galleries willing to exhibit unconventional artwork on Vancouver Island. The goal of OuterSpace is to create a unique, efficient space that allows artists to experiment and show art that may not be accepted in a traditional commercial gallery. We are interested in utilizing funds that would traditionally go towards rent to produce art books/zines, prints, murals and other projects which support the artists we collaborate with. We are very excited to announce the first 3 exhibitions lined up for 2014!April, 2014 - OTHER (Troy Lovegates) - San Francisco*UPDATE - Troy Lovegates' book is well on it's way through production. Here's a sneak peak of some of the drawings in the book, the design/production process + the finished die-cut cover. Grab one of these book perks now, there are only a small number being made.May, 2014 - Luke Ramsey - Pender IslandJune, 2014 - Hiro Kurata - New YorkAn integral part of OuterSpace's mandate is to collaborate with artists to produce books and prints. We will be working with each of these artists to produce an art book for their exhibition. This is where we truly need your help.We had originally thought of starting a fundraising campaign to build the OuterSpace Gallery in 2012, but decided to put in the work and fund the project out of our own pocket to prove what was possible. With two successful exhibitions under our belt, we are now calling out for help to exhibit the work of these three amazing artists and to produce a book to show their artwork outside of this little gallery in Victoria.What we are doing, How you can help &How we will thank-you for making this happen.April, 2014Other/Troy Lovegates will be having an exhibition of new drawings, lino-prints, paintings and carvings. We will be showing this work and launching a new art book in the OuterSpace gallery. Victoria and Vancouver showings. (Artist in attendance)May, 2014Luke Ramsey will be having a book launch for his new Lineage Edition title as well as exhibiting new artwork in the OuterSpace gallery. (Artist in attendance)June, 2014Hiro Kurata will have a book launch for his new Lineage Edition title as well as exhibiting a selection of new experimental paintings in the OuterSpace Gallery. (Artist in attendance)We are asking for your support to help fund the cost of printing an art book and exhibiting the new work by these artists.Minimum Goal $4500Our minimum goal is to raise $4500 which will cover the basic cost to print and bind a handmade edition of books for three artists. That's three books and three artshows! As co-founder of Anteism Publishing Ryan Thompson has years of experience producing art books, access to equipment and high-end, economical printing services. We are able to make unique art books for these artists on a very small budget. *UPDATE - We have completed the prototype Troy Lovegates book. The artist designed a pattern which was then cutout of 140lb acid free watercolour paper. The book highlights 40 pages of recent drawings by Troy Lovegates. Secure your copy of this limited edition book with a $35 donation.Stretch Goal $6500A major aspect of OuterSpace is the outer gallery wall, a dedicated mural space for artists exhibiting in the gallery. We wish to provide a space for artists to paint a legal mural that can be enjoyed by the public. We appreciate the work that goes into a mural and want to provide an artist payment for this work. If we can raise $2000 beyond our minimum goal we will be able to commission these three artists to paint a mural for their exhibition. As a Thank-You for helping us get to our stretch goal we will give everybody who has donated $50 or more a bonus print of one of the finished murals on top of any perks they are already getting. Please help make this happen by spreading the word.*Above - OuterSpace set up on location with James Kirkpatrick mural.Extra SupportOur minimum goal provides us the ability to produce a book for each artist. There are however many other costs that are incurred through running the gallery such as vehicle maintenance, gallery supplies, promotion, insurance/license, travel costs, framing etc. We hope that we can go beyond our minimum goal to ensure successful exhibitions without the worry of a flat tire. We are in the early stages of developing this gallery space and do not receive any other funding or grants. This is a crucial time, we need your help to get some momentum.PerksWe are excited to be bringing these artists work into the gallery but also into the form of books and prints. Our goal is to share the artwork of artists we truly admire and believe in. We hope that you can help us make this project happen and in return you will be given unique artwork, a book or t-shirt that you can't get anywhere else. Many of these perks are created just for this fundraising campaign and supporters will be the first to get the books and other perks which may not be available after the exhibition due to the limited number produced.

<h3>What We're Asking For</h3>
<p>This year we bit off a little more than we could chew with respect to programming, and we find ourselves underfunded by $30,000. Rather than cancel anything, we decided to proceed and have faith that we could get support from our community. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The money raised by this Indiegogo campaign will go directly toward Capture’s 2015 programming.</span></p>
<h3>How Capture Works </h3>
<p>Capture acts as an “umbrella” for dozens of galleries, museums, and organizations to come together to celebrate photography and lens-based arts by individually programming exhibitions and events that fall under this mandate. </p>
<p>Alongside the participating galleries, Capture programs its own feature exhibition, public art installations, and events each year—and this is where we need your help. Artists’ fees, curators’ fees, speakers’ fees, venue rentals, printing costs, all the way down to the hiring of a boom lift to install public artworks are just some of the costs Capture incurs.</p>

</div> <div> <h3>The Payoff</h3> <p></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">When you donate, Capture gets to bring photography-focused events and exhibitions to Vancouver, and you—who we will just take a guess, loves photography—also get some great photography-based perks in return. Whether its voting membership in the Capture Photography Festival Society; a tote bag that proclaims your love for Capture and for photography; an audience with someone from the photography community; or a limited-edition print from one of our four 2015 Mini Edition artists, our thank-you perks offer some pretty great swag at every donation level.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p> </p>Vancouver has a lot to take pride in, and its photography scene is most definitely one of those things. The legacy of the ""Vancouver School"" (the likes of Stan Douglas, Ken Lum, Jeff Wall, and Ian Wallace) is just one piece of the city’s contribution to the international art scene. Vancouver’s current art scene has a lot to offer too, and we need to shout it out loud—to Vancouver and to the world. </div><div>That’s why Capture is leading the charge to celebrate Vancouver’s photographic past but also, importantly, its present and its future. We think this is a pretty important goal for Vancouver, its artists, and its art lovers—and we hope you do too.</div><div>

<h3>Capture 2015 has a packed program!</h3>
<p>The 2015 Capture feature exhibition, <i>Images That Speak</i>, curated by Christopher Eamon, hinges around a work by renowned video artist and Academy Award–winning director Steve McQueen and features artworks by Susanne Kriemann, Michele Abeles, Arthur Ou, and Stephen Waddell, among many others. </p>
<p>Up-and-coming Canadian photographer and Emily Carr graduate Jessica Eaton has created a site-specific public installation for the BC Hydro Dal Grauer Substation on Burrard Street, and the 2015 Canada Line public art project explores the Vancouver region’s Indigenous history. We’re also hosting a family-friendly Tailgate Party in Mount Pleasant with Other Sights for Artists’ Projects (April 18), and the Cinematheque is screening a double-bill of Michael Snow’s <i>Wavelength</i> and Michelangelo Antonioni’s <i>Blow-Up</i> (April 22 and 24).</p>
<p>… And this is just a very small snapshot of the 100+ exhibitions and events the 2015 festival has to offer.</p>

<h3>What will Capture 2016 look like?</h3>
<p>Capture tries to offer something for everyone precisely because photography is for everyone. We hope Capture only grows to include more exhibitions, more events, and more public installations and events. The Capture team has already cooked up some exciting plans for next year’s festival. We’re dreaming big!</p>
<p>We've got plans to reach out to early-career artists in a big way in 2016—stay tuned for opportunities for emerging artists to be featured in a future Capture exhibition. </p>
<p>
Supporting artists, curators, and the photography community at large is what we're all about here at Capture. We're all in, and we hope you'll join us.</p>

</div><p></p>showi</div>","Update, April 7: Wow, thanks everybody! We've hit our initial target, thanks to your generosity. We're floored by your support of photography and of Capture. Since we've got three weeks left on the campaign, let's see if we can edge in on our stretch goal: $30,000!

Vancouver + Photography = A Vibrant City






Jessica Eaton, DG Weave, 2015, Dal Grauer Substation installation mock-up. Capture 2015 public installation.

Capture Photography Festival is Vancouver’s first citywide photography festival. You can expect photography exhibitions, public installations, and events to take over Greater Vancouver every April from now on. Capture is here to promote awareness of Vancouver’s unique history of photoconceptualism, inspire community engagement with photography, and create platforms for showcasing local and international artists. 
As a new festival that is not-for-profit, Capture relies on the generosity of public and private supporters, such as yourself, to bring its varied and accessible programming across the lower mainland.


What We're Asking For
This year we bit off a little more than we could chew with respect to programming, and we find ourselves underfunded by $30,000. Rather than cancel anything, we decided to proceed and have faith that we could get support from our community. The money raised by this Indiegogo campaign will go directly toward Capture’s 2015 programming.
How Capture Works 
Capture acts as an “umbrella” for dozens of galleries, museums, and organizations to come together to celebrate photography and lens-based arts by individually programming exhibitions and events that fall under this mandate. 
Alongside the participating galleries, Capture programs its own feature exhibition, public art installations, and events each year—and this is where we need your help. Artists’ fees, curators’ fees, speakers’ fees, venue rentals, printing costs, all the way down to the hiring of a boom lift to install public artworks are just some of the costs Capture incurs.

  The Payoff 
When you donate, Capture gets to bring photography-focused events and exhibitions to Vancouver, and you—who we will just take a guess, loves photography—also get some great photography-based perks in return. Whether its voting membership in the Capture Photography Festival Society; a tote bag that proclaims your love for Capture and for photography; an audience with someone from the photography community; or a limited-edition print from one of our four 2015 Mini Edition artists, our thank-you perks offer some pretty great swag at every donation level.

   The Impact  Vancouver has a lot to take pride in, and its photography scene is most definitely one of those things. The legacy of the ""Vancouver School"" (the likes of Stan Douglas, Ken Lum, Jeff Wall, and Ian Wallace) is just one piece of the city’s contribution to the international art scene. Vancouver’s current art scene has a lot to offer too, and we need to shout it out loud—to Vancouver and to the world. That’s why Capture is leading the charge to celebrate Vancouver’s photographic past but also, importantly, its present and its future. We think this is a pretty important goal for Vancouver, its artists, and its art lovers—and we hope you do too.

Capture Photography Festival: 2015 and Beyond

Capture 2015 has a packed program!
The 2015 Capture feature exhibition, Images That Speak, curated by Christopher Eamon, hinges around a work by renowned video artist and Academy Award–winning director Steve McQueen and features artworks by Susanne Kriemann, Michele Abeles, Arthur Ou, and Stephen Waddell, among many others. 
Up-and-coming Canadian photographer and Emily Carr graduate Jessica Eaton has created a site-specific public installation for the BC Hydro Dal Grauer Substation on Burrard Street, and the 2015 Canada Line public art project explores the Vancouver region’s Indigenous history. We’re also hosting a family-friendly Tailgate Party in Mount Pleasant with Other Sights for Artists’ Projects (April 18), and the Cinematheque is screening a double-bill of Michael Snow’s Wavelength and Michelangelo Antonioni’s Blow-Up (April 22 and 24).
… And this is just a very small snapshot of the 100+ exhibitions and events the 2015 festival has to offer.

What will Capture 2016 look like?
Capture tries to offer something for everyone precisely because photography is for everyone. We hope Capture only grows to include more exhibitions, more events, and more public installations and events. The Capture team has already cooked up some exciting plans for next year’s festival. We’re dreaming big!
We've got plans to reach out to early-career artists in a big way in 2016—stay tuned for opportunities for emerging artists to be featured in a future Capture exhibition. 

Supporting artists, curators, and the photography community at large is what we're all about here at Capture. We're all in, and we hope you'll join us.

</h6>
<p>FIGMENT is an annual free public art event where all of the art is somehow interactive and the public is invited to bring their own art, play with everything they find at FIGMENT, and enjoy public space in a unique way. In our first year in Boston/Cambridge, we entertained over 5,000 people along the banks of the Charles River with nearly 100 interactive art pieces including dance, sculpture, chalking, live music, DJ music, art cars, art bikes, storytelling, giant bubbles, costumes, and much more!</p>
<p>Founded in 2007 on New York City’s Governors Island with a handful of projects and a few thousand enthusiasts, FIGMENT has grown exponentially into a multi-day, multi-city event that drew over 30,000 participants in NYC and Boston in 2010. With the addition of Jackson, Mississippi in 2011, FIGMENT continues its mission to offer free, inclusive and participatory art to entire communities, removing the barriers of museum and gallery walls and entrance fees and blurring the lines between those who create and those who enjoy art.</p>
<p>This indiegogo campaign will help fund FIGMENT Boston for its 2011 year.  This is our second year in Boston and this year we are excited to have a new home right in the heart of the city on the <a href=""http://www.rosekennedygreenway.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Rose Kennedy Greenway!  </a>This year, FIGMENT's unique free public art experience will take place on two days, June 4 and 5, along the Greenway parks from <a href=""http://www.rosekennedygreenway.org/visit/maps.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Chinatown to Rowes Wharf</a>.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>FIGMENT is 100% free and volunteer run and accepts NO advertising or corporate sponsors, we rely entirely on donations and foundation support for our modest budget.  This year, we are trying out indiegogo for the first time.  Our indiegogo campaign goal of $5000 is approximately half our operating budget for 2011.  This money goes for the basics: insurance, security, equipment rentals, permit fees, and signage.  </p>
<p>Nobody at FIGMENT makes any money, so every dime of your donation (after indiegogo and paypal fees) goes directly to our expenses!  We are also raising money through several great fundraising parties (certain contributions at this site will get you tickets to the first party as a thank-you).  Check our <a href=""http://boston.figmentproject.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""boston.figmentproject.org"">website </a>for more details.</p>
<p>Even if we don't reach our full $5000 goal, your contribution will still help bring FIGMENT to Boston. If we meet our goal, please keep donating!  We can always use any excess for bigger art or roll it into the budget for 2012.</p>
<p>Donations to FIGMENT Boston are tax deductible to the full extent of the law.  FIGMENT Boston is organized under FIGMENT Project, Inc., a New York based 501(c)(3) corporation.</p>

<li>We are the Guild of St. George North, a 501c3 educational non-profit organization whose mission is to bring the history of the renaissance to life for the enjoyment and education of the public.<br/>
</li> <li>The Director and Guildmaster of St. George North, Rydell Downward, has for the last many years portrayed Robert Dudley, The Earl of Liecester at various fairs throughout northern California. After many years, his current costume that has served him very well has come to the end of its life.<br/>
</li> <li>Your generous contribution will make it possible for the guild to present to Rydell a new costume as a token of our thanks and appreciation to everything he has done over the years, not just for our guild, but for the reenactment fair community as a whole.<br/>
</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul>
<li>Our lead costume designer, Jennifer Erlichman (aka Lucrezia Vivaldi), has put together an estimate based on her past experience of $4,000 USD. This estimate goes to the cost of fabrics, trims, buttons, notions, interfacing, interlinings, notions, and all the various and sundry material needs.  This <b>does</b> include  labor cost for the creation of the costume, which is being generously discounted by her!!!  <br/>
</li> <li>We are asking for $4,360 to cover the campaign and credit card processing fees.<br/>
</li> <li>If we do not reach our final goal, we will be forced to scale back the project, as well as possibly be forced to ask Rydell to make up the difference out of his own pocket.<br/>
</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <ul>
<li>The renaissance fair in northern California is an institution like no other. Education is blended with entertainment to bring the history to life before your very eyes.  To create a courtier costume of the highest caliber gives us the unique opportunity to educate and entertain the public on the haute couture of the 16th century.<br/>
</li> <li>While this is our first Indiegogo campaign, this is not our first time working on a project such as this.  Jennifer Erlichman is a consummate professional costumer, who is not only responsible for the creation of several court costumes for herself, but also is responsible for attiring Bob Collier in his role as Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex. <br/>
</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p> <ul>
<li>The largest hurtle facing us as this moment is simply the sheer cost of the materials needed to properly replicate the costume as presented in the portrait of Lord Leicester.  Some of the fabric is still made by hand on looms that have not changed in design since the 1400's.  We must import silks from Venice, just like the Courtiers of Queen Elizabeth's court.  Gilt braiding will come from England.<br/>
</li> <li>We've been blessed by the generous commitment of several members of the guild and renaissance fair community who have graciously volunteered their skills, dedicated research and effort into producing the costume. Our team has a combined experience well in excess of 50+ of participating in fairs and producing supremely high quality costumes for various courts.<br/>
</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <ul>
<li>Even if you cannot contribute monetarily to our campaign, there are still quite a few ways you can help.  The biggest way you can help is to volunteer to help in the construction of the costume.  Jennifer estimates anywhere betwen 200-500 person hours of  work will be required in the physical construction, let alone in the time and effort to track down and source the specific components from various international suppliers.<br/>
</li> <li>As important as your generous monetary donation is to the project success, donating your social media network could be even more valuable.  The renaissance fair community is a small, but extremely close-knit and wonderful community.  Using your social media presence to extend our message of love and thanks to Rydel, who has been a pillar of the northern California fair community for many years would be the most joyous gift we could give to a man who gives so selflessly of his time and effort.  Please help us make this project a wonderful success. </li> </ul>

Ma démarche et mon parcours<br/></strong><p></p><p><b>J</b>e suis une artiste peintre authentique,
sympathique et unique. Je suis une femme passionnée qui aime explorer
diverses formes de créativité artistique. Autodidacte en peinture depuis plus
de 15 ans, j’ai fait mes débuts avec l’aquarelle. Je développe plus tard une
passion pour l’acrylique et les techniques mixtes qui me permettent de danser
avec la peinture, de mélanger des styles, des textures, des contrastes. Voilà
comment j’ai évolué, grandit et je peux maintenant me permettre de vous offrir mes
créations uniques, inspirées et inspirantes. Une partie de moi.</p>
<p><b>M</b>a
façon de peindre est intuitive, émotive, physique et sensorielle. Ce sont les
couleurs, les textures et les contrastes qui me conduisent à en extraire une
idée ou une histoire, une émotion. Que ma peinture vous touche, qu’elle vous
parle et vous donne envie de la regarder encore et d’y renouveler le plaisir.
Peindre est devenue vital pour moi,  afin
de m’exprimer, de me permettre d’explorer, de découvrir, de me sentir vivante.
La profondeur des couleurs, leurs vibrations, leur onctuosité, leur luminosité
et l’infinité de possibilités de création sont mes muses. Je laisse aller mes
pinceaux. Parfois pour me rendre compte que je pourrais mieux faire, mieux
représenter mes idées, mes rêves et ma folie. Et c’est reparti! Souvent les
idées me viennent au fur et à mesure, comme si c’était la toile elle-même qui
guidait mes pinceaux. </p>
<p><b>J</b>’aime peindre avec des pinceaux, bien sûr, aussi avec des spatules,
brosses à plancher, laines d’acier, essuie-tout, cure-dent et très souvent avec
mes doigts. Oui, mes doigts, mes mains. Ce sont des outils faciles à manier,
intimes, au résultat unique, chaleureux et heureusement lavables.</p><p><b></b></p><p>Pour vous parlez de ma démarche
artistique je ferai référence à deux souvenirs d’enfance enfouis quelque part
et pourtant si instinctifs et si authentiques. Le premier vient d’une époque
pas si lointaine où l’on prenait encore le temps de se coucher sur l’herbe
épaisse et riche de l’été ou encore tranquillement allongé dans un hamac; dans
les tas de feuilles de l’automne; s’étendant l’hiver pour imprégner la marque
d’un ange. On lève immédiatement les yeux au ciel et on admire le passage des
nuages. Notre imagination innocente nous amenait à voir toutes sortes de formes
des plus douces aux plus menaçantes. Des visages, des éléphants, des lapins,
des rêves de toutes les couleurs selon l’heure et la saison. </p>
<p>La deuxième inspiration me vient d’un
jeu tout simple qui consiste à faire un gribouillis quelconque sur une feuille
puis l’autre joueur doit en tirer un dessin reconnaissable. Vous souvenez-vous
de toutes les idées farfelues qui en découlait et parfois même quelques
résultats surprenants. Le tout était enivré par les rires, la complicité, la
légèreté de l’âme.</p>
<p>Voilà deux de mes principales démarches
créatives mais la texture et la richesse des couleurs me font aussi réagir, mes
sens sont inspirés par la peinture. La vue évidemment, le toucher car je peins
souvent avec mes doigts, mes mains. Les odeurs de peinture oui mais aussi les
odeurs qui flottent autour de moi, surtout lorsque je peins dehors dans un parc
ou au bord d’un lac. L’ouïe puisque ma façon de bouger au rythme de la musique
et de m’inspirer de l’émotion me font voir un éventail de possibilités. Le goût
un peu moins je l’avoue sauf lorsque je me permets de boire un bon café bien
corsé pour m’accompagner devant le chevalet.</p>
<p>J’ai également été élevé dans l’amour
de la beauté, l’amour du frisson qui donne envie d’harmoniser son environnement
par la décoration de son nid. Ayant été initiée toute jeune à la photographie
de manière artistique, pour immortaliser certaines situations de mon
environnement, des voyages ou des personnes qui me sont chères, j’ai acquis un

par l’art rehausse notre estime de soi, notre plaisir et libère l’esprit!Il y a plus de 15 ans, j’ai débuté par peindre à l’aquarelle de manière autodidacte. Plus
tard, j’ai appris la fabrication des vitraux et suivi une formation pour la
production de mosaïques artistiques. Depuis plus de 5 ans maintenant, je peins
à l’acrylique et utilise toutes sortes de techniques bien particulières à moi.Pour la petite histoire, je suis fibromyalgique, ce qui fait que je ne travaille pas depuis plus de 5 ans. J’habite un petit appartement avec mes deux filles toujours aux études. Vous comprendrez que l’on se sent coincées parmi toutes les peintures, soit sur les murs, soit appuyées au mur. J’aimerais beaucoup pouvoir me trouver un atelier et ainsi retrouver un peu d’espace de vie de famille. La proximité de toutes mes toiles nuit aussi à mon inspiration et à ma créativité.Je suis rendue à la croisée des chemins et je me dois d'investir pour le futur, pour avoir la vie à laquelle j'aspire en tant qu'artiste et en tant que femme.C'est ce qui me fait grandir, m'épanouir, me dépasser et me fait plaisir tout simplement!Votre précieuse aide servira à :
Viser un marché  plus grand, entrer dans les galeries, être de
plus en plus professionnelle dans mes expositions
Faire des démarches pour trouver un
agent
Formations en dessin et autres
techniques
Un automne bien chargé, à voyager d’un
événement à l’autre, amène des frais de déplacements et d’organisation considérables.
Mon but serait de conserver la cadence actuelle et de développer un marché à l’extérieur
de l’Estrie
Site internet à monter et à entretenir
Tournage de petits clips sur différentes techniques
Cartes d’affaires, affiches, promotion,
événements publicitaire, cartes blanches, toute papeterie
Portfolio professionnel (photos de
qualité) et matériel associé
Du matériel de qualité (peinture,
toile, pinceaux, crayons aquarelles, médiums mixtes, vernis, quincaillerie,
divers objets de la vie courante)
Matériel de communication, informatique,
photographique et téléphonique
Trouver un local pour y implanter mon
atelier
Possibilité d'échanges entre artistes à l'international
Possibilité d’aller étudier auprès de
mentors 
Possibilité de résidence d’artiste
Ma démarche et mon parcoursJe suis une artiste peintre authentique,
sympathique et unique. Je suis une femme passionnée qui aime explorer
diverses formes de créativité artistique. Autodidacte en peinture depuis plus
de 15 ans, j’ai fait mes débuts avec l’aquarelle. Je développe plus tard une
passion pour l’acrylique et les techniques mixtes qui me permettent de danser
avec la peinture, de mélanger des styles, des textures, des contrastes. Voilà
comment j’ai évolué, grandit et je peux maintenant me permettre de vous offrir mes
créations uniques, inspirées et inspirantes. Une partie de moi.
Ma
façon de peindre est intuitive, émotive, physique et sensorielle. Ce sont les
couleurs, les textures et les contrastes qui me conduisent à en extraire une
idée ou une histoire, une émotion. Que ma peinture vous touche, qu’elle vous
parle et vous donne envie de la regarder encore et d’y renouveler le plaisir.
Peindre est devenue vital pour moi,  afin
de m’exprimer, de me permettre d’explorer, de découvrir, de me sentir vivante.
La profondeur des couleurs, leurs vibrations, leur onctuosité, leur luminosité
et l’infinité de possibilités de création sont mes muses. Je laisse aller mes
pinceaux. Parfois pour me rendre compte que je pourrais mieux faire, mieux
représenter mes idées, mes rêves et ma folie. Et c’est reparti! Souvent les
idées me viennent au fur et à mesure, comme si c’était la toile elle-même qui
guidait mes pinceaux. 
J’aime peindre avec des pinceaux, bien sûr, aussi avec des spatules,
brosses à plancher, laines d’acier, essuie-tout, cure-dent et très souvent avec
mes doigts. Oui, mes doigts, mes mains. Ce sont des outils faciles à manier,
intimes, au résultat unique, chaleureux et heureusement lavables.Pour vous parlez de ma démarche
artistique je ferai référence à deux souvenirs d’enfance enfouis quelque part
et pourtant si instinctifs et si authentiques. Le premier vient d’une époque
pas si lointaine où l’on prenait encore le temps de se coucher sur l’herbe
épaisse et riche de l’été ou encore tranquillement allongé dans un hamac; dans
les tas de feuilles de l’automne; s’étendant l’hiver pour imprégner la marque
d’un ange. On lève immédiatement les yeux au ciel et on admire le passage des
nuages. Notre imagination innocente nous amenait à voir toutes sortes de formes
des plus douces aux plus menaçantes. Des visages, des éléphants, des lapins,
des rêves de toutes les couleurs selon l’heure et la saison. 
La deuxième inspiration me vient d’un
jeu tout simple qui consiste à faire un gribouillis quelconque sur une feuille
puis l’autre joueur doit en tirer un dessin reconnaissable. Vous souvenez-vous
de toutes les idées farfelues qui en découlait et parfois même quelques
résultats surprenants. Le tout était enivré par les rires, la complicité, la
légèreté de l’âme.
Voilà deux de mes principales démarches
créatives mais la texture et la richesse des couleurs me font aussi réagir, mes
sens sont inspirés par la peinture. La vue évidemment, le toucher car je peins
souvent avec mes doigts, mes mains. Les odeurs de peinture oui mais aussi les
odeurs qui flottent autour de moi, surtout lorsque je peins dehors dans un parc
ou au bord d’un lac. L’ouïe puisque ma façon de bouger au rythme de la musique
et de m’inspirer de l’émotion me font voir un éventail de possibilités. Le goût
un peu moins je l’avoue sauf lorsque je me permets de boire un bon café bien
corsé pour m’accompagner devant le chevalet.
J’ai également été élevé dans l’amour
de la beauté, l’amour du frisson qui donne envie d’harmoniser son environnement
par la décoration de son nid. Ayant été initiée toute jeune à la photographie
de manière artistique, pour immortaliser certaines situations de mon
environnement, des voyages ou des personnes qui me sont chères, j’ai acquis un
regard sûr pour l’équilibre du cadrage d’un cliché.
Sans pouvoir intellectualiser ma
démarche, sans vouloir d’ailleurs l’intellectualiser mais plutôt la laisser se
développer au rythme de mes émotions, je vous présente mon travail. Le fruit de
l’instinct, de l’amour et de la liberté plutôt que celui de la réflexion intellectuelle.

<p>Black Mountain College was an innovative educational haven for the mid-20th century. Tucked away in the mountains of Western North Carolina, the school used Art as a centerpiece for their liberal arts curriculum, with a foundation inspired by educational reformist John Dewey. The school has remained relatively unknown, but celebrated names in Art such as Willem DeKooning, Buckminster Fuller, and John Cage all have called it home.</p><p>
</p><h3>What is {Re}Happening?</h3>
<p>In honor of the progressive minds who taught and studied there, Asheville’s Black Mountain College Museum and Arts Center, along with Asheville’s Media Arts Project, curates an annual art event, {Re}Happening. Born in 2009 and steadily growing in recognition, the show consists of artists who are pushing the limits of installation, performance, sculpture, and interactive art. As an artist working in photography, installation, and performance, I created a proposal, along with a team, that was accepted for the April 2014 event.</p>
<h3>What is our project?</h3>
<p>We are building a camera obscura – the ancient predecessor of the modern camera. The camera obscura is simply a room with a small hole in one wall, which naturally projects an image of whatever exists by outside the room onto the opposite wall. The resulting image is reversed both laterally and top-to-bottom. Our camera obscura will be large enough to fit four viewers and a musician inside, who will witness a dramatic performance of actors from our team outside the room , narrated with a musical soundtrack.</p>
<h3>Why do we do this?</h3>
<p>We are proud to embody Black Mountain College’s spirit of cross-disciplinary art experiments by merging music, performance art, and camera-based visuals in our project. We are also combining old and new technologies, from the camera obscura’s beginnings which date back to Aristotle, to its common use during Renaissance times as a viewing room, to our modern adaptation of creating a performance that is shaped by its optics. The viewers will be given instructions that allow them to choose either moods or dialogue that lead the performers through the performance art aspect of the project, creating an art experience that is participatory for the viewer rather than passive.</p>
<p>My team consists of dedicated artists, but we need to fundraise for ensured success with this project.</p>

<p>Smocking is an ancient
technique involving gathering and pleating of fabric and was developed in
England during the middle ages.<span>  It was
used as a means of providing elasticity for fabric and also for creating
insulation.  There are a variety of
different smocking techniques which are both within the fashion industry and
the world of interior design.</span></p>
Shibori
is a Japanese technique that is equally as ancient as smocking with some of the
earliest examples dating from the 8<sup>th</sup> Century.<span>  The technique was used originally as a form
of resist dyeing and involves pleating, folding, stitching and binding of
various fabrics in a multitude of different ways to create surface
patterns.  The development of synthetic
fabrics, however, has enabled some of these shibori techniques to be used as a
means of permanently shaping fabric in a variety of exciting patterns.</span><p>
</p><p>Chaudry states:<span>  “There are two parts to my working practice
which hold equal weight and have been consistent throughout; making and
materiality.</span></p>
<p>Coming from a family
heritage in tailoring has instilled a sense of craftsmanship and I have come to
value the many processes of making, especially repetitive and labor intensive
work.  There is something in the stillness of these ways of working which
allows me to think about the world and my place in it.</p>
<p>Growing up with a tailor
also meant growing up with scraps of fabric and lots of them.  This is
where my love for materials and especially texture, comes from.  I believe
that all matter can conceivably be considered a material and therefore belongs
in an artist’s toolbox.”</p>

Nadim Chaudry collaborated with Los Angeles based artist Patssi Valdez during
her 2013 month long residency at the Nottingham Contemporary for the
exhibition, “Asco – No Movies”.
Known for his highly
structural fiber pieces, the pairing was a perfect compliment.  While in Nottingham for the exhibit, Patssi
conducted workshops creating Paper Fashions. 
She and Nadim created the new Paper Fashions idiom for the 21st
Century.
This campaign will bring
this important and highly noted British artist, Kashif Nadim Chaudry to Los
Angeles to conduct a workshop to showcase two of his favorite techniques, smocking and shibori, both of which will turn a flat piece of fabric into a
rich, 3D structured surface.

I am an aspiring artist looking to do a bit of upgrading. My current equipment is not cutting it anymore. And with a cross country move, along with the broken items due to said move, fresh on my shoulders, I am calling out to those who can spare a moment to help.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The wily tablet, a real piece of equipment, I hope you all will help me capture will help lighten what workload I have and push me further to what I have always wanted to be, a real professional artist. Working digitally as well as cleanly is essential and sadly with the lack of funds, slow work and now ruined equipment lumbering around what little nickels and dimes I have, I am finding it difficult to work towards my potential. You can find my current works at the bottom of this page in the links and the link of my name. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>To step up the game I humbly and happily ask and in turn thank, for again, even a moment of spare time. Pass this on if you don't mind as well, the more the merrier. All and any help is more than appreciated! I just wish to do the best I can, won't you help me do so?</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p>I need $700 to fund the tablet that I want and cover the fees/shipping. Meanwhile if we do not reach our goal together then I will stuff it in a piggy bank and continue working towards this goal.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>This campaign is really something to help me grow to be a better artist. To gain an advantage towards increasing my consistency and professionalism. Which as any type of artist it is all you really have other than your skill. It is said that tools do not make the artist, you use what you have and appreciate it. And I truly do, but it is time to move it to the next level and take that step up. Again thank you all for making a difference in my life.  </p>

As I said before, the more the merrier! </p>
