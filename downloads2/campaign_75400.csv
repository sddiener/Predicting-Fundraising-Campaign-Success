<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Epic started out as a little website called 'Boner Party', a light hearted sex humor site that got a lot of attention and amassed a pretty solid readership. I got tired of the format, and decided to turn it into something better - a legitimate magazine with original articles, pictorials and interviews solely on the internet. Not a single serving web presence of a magazine, like so many others, and not just a blog, but one focuses exclusively on original material. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a freelance writer and editor I've often supplied my work to established blogs for exposure and not for pay. This is the case for many who are freelancers and is highlighted by any random search of the Writing/Editing jobs on Craigslist: get paid in ""exposure"". As anyone who's ever realized that ""exposure"" doesn't pay the bills can tell you, ""exposure"" on a website and a dollar fifty will get you a cup of coffee and little more. I should know. I spent months living on friends couches wondering why established companies were paying on a scale due to pageviews or more often than not, nothing at all. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So, I took that time on couches to figure it out. And it's simple: Pay the artists. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>What I plan to do is have people submit original work and pay them to feature it on the site. The writer or photographer would get their work featured on the site and a small amount of cash - plain and simple. No catch. They'd get to keep the rights to their work. All I'd ask in return is that they acknowledge in future usage that their work appeared on Epic first. The articles and photographs that run would follow the editorial direction of myself and a few others (a photo editor and a copy editor) who would help give birth to this new venture. Should you so kindly invest in us you wouldn't be buying us dinner: the only money we'd make would be on advertisements and a future iPad app of the magazine showcasing the highlights of the original online magazine. The money that you donate to us would be used to pay the writer or photographer. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I plan to feature one submitted original writing piece a day. This could mean a short story, profile, or opinion piece of a couple thousand words to a few original paragraphs. I plan to pay the contributor $20 for their work, serializing longer pieces (one half on Monday, the final half the next Monday, etc) if necessary in order to pay them more. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>4 x $20 = $80</p>
<p>$80 x 4 (weeks a month) = $320 a month</p>
<p>$320 x 12 (months in a year) = $3,840 a year<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Once a week, Epic plans to feature the work of a photographer, who would submit a small cache of photographs which would be featured on the site. I plan to occasionally showcase nudity in the weekly photographic feature as I believe that nudity is not a thing to be afraid of, some may have an issue with this and I'd like to state loud and clear that we in no way shall be displaying photography that is distasteful or derogatory. Think more Ryan McGinley, Jim Herrington, or Noah Kalina. At it's most colorful, the Epic pictorials would resemble early Playboy. We simply believe that nudity is nothing to be afraid of and that the human body (of both women and men) is a beautiful thing. We plan to pay both the photographer and the model the same amount of money, separately, and via Paypal. This way it is fair to the model and the photographer. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>$100 (for the photographer) + $100 (for the model)<br/>4 (weeks in a month) x $200 = $800 a month<br/>$800 x 12 (months in a year) = $9,600 a year</p>
<p>________________</p>
<p>This brings our grand total up to $13,400 a year to run Epic and to pay our contributors fairly. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Even though the current incantation of Epic is new, we have over 7,000 subscribers on Tumblr. We also have a podcast that reaches over 100,000 people a month ('This American Wife', which features guests from MSTK3000 to Gwar to Justine Bateman, etc) which drives in a lot of traffic to the website. This way, you can be assured that your donation will reach a very sizable and diverse audience.<br/></p>

4 x $20 = $80

Once a week, Epic plans to feature the work of a photographer, who would submit a small cache of photographs which would be featured on the site.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>One of my goals on my bucket list over the past few years, is to volunteer abroad in Peru and work with children. Reaching outside of my immediate community is not new to me. And neither is my love for working with kids.  I have volunteered in the past with children in the Dominican Republic, built a home in Sydell Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina, and helped to rebuild mobile homes on the Lakota Indian Reservation in South Dakota.  I've been active with many charities domestically that benefit children including the Make A Wish Foundation. I also have the desire to initiate a yearly volunteer trip at my alma mater (for a later date).  In the Dominican Republic, I was blessed to have spent time with so many wonderful children, teaching them in the classroom, reading books together and playing games together outside.  I walked away from the experience taking away more from it than I thought I would.  My main takeaway was that caring ways, friendship and love mean so much to these children even more so than the donations that we brought with us on the trip.  Kindness and reaching out to others goes a long way in life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why Peru? Peru like many countries face a high level of poverty.  Many children have a lack of education and health care.  I've been blessed to be able to fund my own education through loans and obtain degrees, but that happened because my life was filled with wonderful mentors who encouraged me, including family, teachers, people at my church, and coaches.  I want to play an important though small part in loving, encouraging and supporting these children.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So why now? I've always wanted to do this.  I am blessed to be graduating from Notre Dame this year and starting an amazing job in August.  I'll be staying with my family for the summer and this is an ideal time to volunteer.  I am unbelievably excited to say the least. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When am I going? My trip is from June 3rd to the 16th.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I plan to maintain a blog while I am in Peru and upload lots of photos.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I will be volunteering through Globalteer, a UK charity.  The Peru Children's Project is based in Cusco and includes working with orphans, teaching English, playing sports, reading and other fun activities. In addition, I will be doing manual work to improve the project facilities.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Do I Need</h3>
<p>I have a hard time asking people for money.  However, living off loans for the past year and not starting work until August this year, makes for a tight budget.  My ideal goal is to fundraise the cost of the required ""donation"" that I am paying to Globalteer and to then donate the rest of the money I raise to this program for the benefit of the children and the facility.  I am paying for my own flight separately as well as food and miscellaneous expenses.  The donation that I will be paying to Globalteer is $920 and includes the following (project donation, airport pickup, accomodation, orientation, and in country support).  HOWEVER, if I don't make my goal of $1500, I will split whatever money I raise between my required donation and additional donation that I would like to make to the program.  I am asking people to consider donating to my cause and my dream of volunteering in Peru.  Every little bit helps.  THANK YOU!</p>

Inspired by these events, she created She Rescue Home: a safe, secure home, located in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, for young girls, ages 5-15, w</span>ho are at risk or have been rescued from being trafficked. “There are complex issues that contribute to a girl being vulnerable to trafficking. Factors such as poverty, abuse, trickery or deception and unemployment or addiction in the family unit.” Each girl at SHE home is given counseling, medical attention, educational/vocational training, food, shelter, and clothing. Eventually, when the rehabilitation process is complete, the girls are re-integrated back into their family and Khmer society. SHE homes also work in partnership with local and international agencies in Cambodia to give the girls, their families and their communities opportunities to change their lives.</p>
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">
<br/>*WHAT'S MY PART?*<br/><br/>On January 14th, I will begin volunteering at the She Rescue Home in Phnom Penh, Cambodia for 6 months. I will be responsible for a wide variety of tasks in order to help out in any way I can. In addition to leading daily devotions and English lessons with both the staff and girls of the SHE home, I will be doing anything from administrative work and cleaning, to biking with the girls and helping them with homework. I am also looking forward to being able to apply my love for arts, sewing and design through doing arts and crafts with the girls and teaching them to sew (a valuable skill for a young Khmer girl to have in order to find work).<br/><br/>A year ago if someone told me that I’d be hopping on a plane to Cambodia to volunteer for 6 months, I’d have thought they were crazy. But now, I have never been more sure about a decision in my life. These young women have completely inpired and altered my perspective, and I haven’t even met them yet. I am honored to be a part of God’s work in their lives, and I’m anxious to see how they’re going to change mine.<br/><br/>Now, in order for me to be able to embark on this journey, there is alot that needs to be prepared first: physically, mentally, AND spiritually.  One thing in particular that I need is to raise approximately $5,500.

<p><strong>Has climbing changed your life?</strong> Share the gift of climbing with an at-risk kid from the slums of Brazil and receive cool Christmas gifts from BEYONDgear.</p>
<p>The favelas (slums) of Rio de Janeiro are built within a Mecca of world class climbing. Youth in these underprivileged communities are faced with an array of difficulties and negative influences like drugs, violence and gang life. Climbing can offer these youth a positive alternative to their daily struggles and the construction of a modern climbing wall will provide them with this opportunity.</p>
<p>Approximately 5,000 murders are reported per year in Rio de Janeiro's favelas. Climbing is not the end all solution but it can certainly help.</p>

<h3>Our Story - A letter from Asa Firestone, Co-Founder of BEYONDgear and the CEU Urban Climbing School</h3>
<p>In 2003, while living in Brazil, I traveled to Rio de Janeiro to climb on the wild granite peaks that erupt right out of the city. On the slopes of these cliffs, massive favelas (slums) have spawned from decades of Brazilian social inequalities. While visiting Rio, I was inspired to climb the wild ‘Two Brothers’ peak that soars 1,000 feet above the famous Ipanema Beach. However, I was told it was too dangerous due to heavily armed drug militias that made their headquarters in the nearby favelas. I was frustrated that a peak could not be climbed because of crime. I decided to do my part to change that by sharing my positive experiences of climbing with the favela community. By providing outdoor education and enabling access to the climbing resources just above the favelas, the power of adventure can be harnessed to change lives.</p>

</div>
<p>In 2010, I teamed up with Andrew Lenz, a brilliant local climbing guide and change maker, to form the CEU Urban Climbing School in the Rocinha Favela. Rocinha is one of the largest slums in Brazil and located just below the Two Brothers Peak. CEU is a not for profit organization that utilizes the local rock climbing resources to help at-risk youth in Rio's favelas. CEU recently obtained permission from the Brazilian Bureau of Sports (SUDERJ) to build a professional climbing wall in the government managed Rocinha sports complex.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise $50,000 to build a state of the art climbing wall in a government run sports complex in the Rocinha Favela (slum) of Rio de Janeiro. This climbing wall will facilitate replacing the bad risks of drugs and violence so prevalent in these communities with the positive risks of adventure. If we raise more money, we will continue to support the CEU Urban Climbing School in Rio to use rock climbing to help kids from the favelas. See below for a mock up of the climbing wall project:</p>

<h3><strong>What are we going to do with the money?</strong></h3>
<p>All proceeds raised by this campaign will go towards building a climbing wall for at-risk youth in the Favelas of Rio de Janiero, Brazil. With the sale of just 2,000 BEYONDgear bracelets, necklaces, hats and tees, we will have the appropriate funds to see this project through. Additional proceeds will go to the CEU Urban Climbing School to fund climbing education for the same at-risk youth.</p>
<p>Most of the money collected in this campaign will go directly to the project. Manufacturing and distribution costs associated with BEYONDgear products that are purchased through Indiegogo, as well as minor administrative fees will be deducted from the total collected. </p>

<p><strong>What is a Stopper and why are many of our items designed around it?</strong></p>
<p>A Stopper or Nut is a piece of climbing gear that protects climbers from falls. It is a tapered piece of metal that a climber lodges into a crack so it gets stuck and then connects his/her rope to it.

<p><strong>What are our products made out of?</strong></p>
<p>The Stopper Necklace / Bracelet is made out of pewter. The Stopper Earrings are silver plated with a surgical steel post to avoid skin allergies. The Chalk bags are partially made from recycled tents. The flexfit hats are made with 59% bamboo fiber and the rest cotton and spandex.

<p>Yes, there will need to be an additional charge to ship internationally. It costs $15 per item to ship to international addresses.  If you buy a 2-item dual set it costs $25. For a Full-Set it is $40. For a Framed Photo Package it costs an extra $75 (a framed photo is a big item to ship internationally).

The favelas (slums) of Rio de Janeiro are built within a Mecca of world class climbing. Youth in these underprivileged communities are faced with an array of difficulties and negative influences like drugs, violence and gang life. Climbing can offer these youth a positive alternative to their daily struggles and the construction of a modern climbing wall will provide them with this opportunity.
Approximately 5,000 murders are reported per year in Rio de Janeiro's favelas. Climbing is not the end all solution but it can certainly help.
 
How it works:
BEYONDgear is donating ALL PROCEEDS to the construction of a modern climbing wall for the CEU Urban Climbing School right there in the Rocinha ""Favela"" of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

======================================================


We are a team
of people who care about the city we live in and believe that our active
everyday behavior can have an impact on the problems our city faces. Problems like indifference, isolation, poverty, rudeness, ignorance, pollution or simply misery. That's
why 2 years ago we created City of Errors, a video-blog where we share videos about active citizens and the things they do to care for the city and each other. 
Thanks to our videos we made friends around the world and our website recently featured in the interactive map of best city blogs by The Guardian. 





Now we want your help to turn our video-blog into a social network where users will be able to upload their own stories on how they try to make their city a livable place. Stories told by the photos and videos you upload on our website and that others will be able to share, rate, like and contribute to. 


   What We Need 
=====================================================

Up to now City of Errors has been running 100% on volunteer work. And we have exhausted all our skills, even the new ones we got working on this project. Now we need your help to raise 22.000$ (16.000 Euros). By donating you will help us  complete the tools we've been working on and get ready to pass them to the users, who will turn this project into a social network for better cities. Your contribution will help us to:
 Hire the pros that will turn our website into a fun interactive experience rather than another WordPress site.
  Promote and develop further our smartphone app and promote it worldwide.
 Update some of our equipment, hire some extra hands and make more videos like these.
 Edit a feature documentary film called Life in a City Full of Errors. A film about the people who form part of the solutions rather than the problems of our city. 
 Is this a project about our city or every city?=======================================================City of Errors is a platform dedicated to the creation of livable cities. It was born in Athens, a city full of errors, because it needed it a lot. We needed it a lot. We needed to connect with those who had not accepted the idea of living in decadent cities. And who fought against indifference. In every aspect of city life. We realized that we are not alone. That there is many of us all over the world. People who refuse to leave their street, neighborhood or city to turn grey and lonely. Our aim is to give every citizen of every city the space in our platform to share ideas, examples and lessons on how to be part of the solutions rather than the problems of our city and any big city.To show to the entire world that it is the simple little things we do that make cities livable and vibrant.   The Impact
=========================================================
Cities are defined first and foremost by our behavior.The decisions we do or don't take. And it's often what we don't do that makes us part of the problems of our cities. Sometimes we need a little push. A reason or person that will show us how to be considerate, giving, responsible or simply active human. Your contribution will help us complete the tools that give that push that so many of us need. Fun, engaging and interactive tools.Cities cannot change overnight. But we believe that others' stories, can affect the way we act. See the world differently. Even reshape our behavior. And a change in behaviors can ultimately bring a change to our cities.  You can read more our goal here.   Other Ways You Can Help

<h3 dir=""ltr"">Food is medicine, preventative medicine.  A proper, healthy diet, exercise and meditation practiced together can prevent most illnesses.  Our medical system does not provide enough of this information and awareness, educating doctors only to diagnose disease and to treat it with expensive drugs, surgeries and other traditional treatments.  It certainly does not take a holistic approach that treats not only the body but the mind and the spirit, something that, to me, is essential for overall well being.  I intend to offer this holistic approach to clients and to the general public as well as to doctors, clinics and other healthcare professionals as well as to those in the sports industry.  I especially want to bring it to schools and to parents and to any and all who would like to live a long, healthy and happy life.</h3>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Ryan Hopkins.  By trade I am a mechanical designer, with eight years experience in a wide range of manufacturing-related roles.  I have suffered from cervical scoliosis stemming from a sports injury at the age of 10.  Now 32, my daily life is affected by the pain, limitation and imbalance of scoliosis.  I have been given the opinion by several spinal specialists and chiropractors that my only eventual option will be to undergo spinal fusion surgery to fuse the two vertebrae in my neck that have not grown properly through puberty due to my childhood injury.  I find this situation unacceptable and this has caused me to use my design expertise to search for an alternative, both for myself, and for others who suffer from scoliosis.</p>
<p>The most basic form of my invention is envisioned as a therapeutic device usable by medical professionals in the longterm treatment of scoliosis and other mechanical spinal disorders.  The device in its most basic form will consist of a plurality of padded cradles, precisely adjustable in position, designed to provide support to each vertebra in the spine.  This is a total departure from the current state of the art in spinal corrective therapeutic devices.<br/><br/>Scoliosis is a serious medical problem that can have debilitating consequences.  Preventative and corrective therapies can help scoliosis patients achieve a better outcome in terms of their longterm quality of life.  Children who develop scoliosis are at highest risk for developing further complications later in life.  <br/><br/>My aim is to develop a spinal therapeutic system that surpasses currently available therapies in its effectiveness.  This device can help to improve the quality of life for many scoliosis patients who heretofore have had little or no recourse except awkward ineffective and uncomfortable braces, and potentially dangerous spinal fusion therapies.  <br/><br/>The potential that this concept has for giving scoliosis patients back their freedom of motion and lessening of their pain, is of immeasurable value to those who suffer from this disease every day.  What would it mean to you to lessen or live without pain that would otherwise plague you for the rest of your life?</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am seeking US$10,000 over a term of 90 days for the first stage of development, which will cover costs for a patent application, cad design, machining and assembly of components for the prototype, alpha development and testing of the prototype computer control system, and intensive metrics and safety testing of the prototype.<br/><br/>There are ways you can contribute without committing money!  I am seeking partnerships with organizations dedicated to scoliosis awareness, and with chiropractors and back specialists to assist in informing the system's design.</p>
<p>If I am unable to reach the funding goal, the balance of the funds raised will go toward the patent application and development of the concept so that, once I am able to secure further investment in the future, the ptototype can then be developed and tested.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This therapeutic system will affect tangible improvement in the health conditions for many scoliosis patients, which will allow them to lead fuller lives with less pain due to the longterm supportive and preventative maintenance that the system can provide.  If you suffer from scoliosis or know someone who does, you can understand the pain and frustration experienced by the lack of advanced therapeutic options to treat scoliosis and other spinal injuries and diseases.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
If my campaign speaks to you, please share it with your friends and family!  Thank you for your generosity in supporting my dream to help scoliosis patients live better lives!</div></div>","Summary
My name is Ryan Hopkins.  By trade I am a mechanical designer, with eight years experience in a wide range of manufacturing-related roles.  I have suffered from cervical scoliosis stemming from a sports injury at the age of 10.  Now 32, my daily life is affected by the pain, limitation and imbalance of scoliosis.  I have been given the opinion by several spinal specialists and chiropractors that my only eventual option will be to undergo spinal fusion surgery to fuse the two vertebrae in my neck that have not grown properly through puberty due to my childhood injury.  I find this situation unacceptable and this has caused me to use my design expertise to search for an alternative, both for myself, and for others who suffer from scoliosis.
The most basic form of my invention is envisioned as a therapeutic device usable by medical professionals in the longterm treatment of scoliosis and other mechanical spinal disorders.  The device in its most basic form will consist of a plurality of padded cradles, precisely adjustable in position, designed to provide support to each vertebra in the spine.  This is a total departure from the current state of the art in spinal corrective therapeutic devices.Scoliosis is a serious medical problem that can have debilitating consequences.  Preventative and corrective therapies can help scoliosis patients achieve a better outcome in terms of their longterm quality of life.  Children who develop scoliosis are at highest risk for developing further complications later in life.  My aim is to develop a spinal therapeutic system that surpasses currently available therapies in its effectiveness.  This device can help to improve the quality of life for many scoliosis patients who heretofore have had little or no recourse except awkward ineffective and uncomfortable braces, and potentially dangerous spinal fusion therapies.  The potential that this concept has for giving scoliosis patients back their freedom of motion and lessening of their pain, is of immeasurable value to those who suffer from this disease every day.  What would it mean to you to lessen or live without pain that would otherwise plague you for the rest of your life?


What We Need & What You Get
I am seeking US$10,000 over a term of 90 days for the first stage of development, which will cover costs for a patent application, cad design, machining and assembly of components for the prototype, alpha development and testing of the prototype computer control system, and intensive metrics and safety testing of the prototype.There are ways you can contribute without committing money!  I am seeking partnerships with organizations dedicated to scoliosis awareness, and with chiropractors and back specialists to assist in informing the system's design.
If I am unable to reach the funding goal, the balance of the funds raised will go toward the patent application and development of the concept so that, once I am able to secure further investment in the future, the ptototype can then be developed and tested.


The Impact
This therapeutic system will affect tangible improvement in the health conditions for many scoliosis patients, which will allow them to lead fuller lives with less pain due to the longterm supportive and preventative maintenance that the system can provide.  If you suffer from scoliosis or know someone who does, you can understand the pain and frustration experienced by the lack of advanced therapeutic options to treat scoliosis and other spinal injuries and diseases.

<h3>The Idea</h3>
<p>The <span class=""il"">Patchwork</span> Flag is our emblem for creating something new from what's already there. It's about bringing together a cross-cutting network of people dedicated to life-long learning and community in the city of New Orleans.</p>
<p>We're committed to two interrelated ideas:</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><em>life-long learning</em></strong> -- This means more than just taking classes once you're out of school. It means continuing to discover and rediscover new ways of looking at things. We want people to mix it up, get out of their everyday routine and try something new. We want to learn from each other. We want to be intellectually, spiritually, emotionally stimulated.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""im"">
<ul>
<li>
<em><strong>cross-cutting community</strong></em> -- Too often, people get stuck in tracks, in terms of the ways they look at the world and the people they spend all their time with. We all do this. With the <span class=""il"">Patchwork</span> Flag Project, we'll create a structure that brings people together from all over, that opens up the idea of what community can be both on the local neighborhood level and city-wide.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div class=""im"">
<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>For six weeks over the summer, from June 25 to August 3, we'll bring together a group of twenty people from all over the city -- different neighborhoods, age groups, ethnicities, backgrounds, etc. We'll meet in different community and public spaces two times each week. The program is made up of three parts:</p>
</div>
<div class=""im"">
<ul>
<li>
<em>Building cross-cutting community </em>-- as a group, we'll get to know each other, we'll eat together, we'll share our stories and our thoughts about New Orleans.</li>
<li>
<em>Learning together</em> -- Five times over the course of the project, guest teachers, artists, and professionals will give workshops on skills like mediation, urban planning, movement, program design, and public art.</li>
<li>
<em>Developing a public project or event</em> -- As a group, we will collaborate on a structure that advances life-long learning and cross-cutting community in the broader New Orleans public. Doing so will enact those ideas in our group: we'll have to look at things in new ways and collaborate with each other to make this final component happen.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>Related to our philosophy of community-based, non-instituitional learning, is our use of <strong>bartering</strong>. Our program partners with multiple community organizations -- including Tekrema Center for Art and Culture and Ashe Cultural Arts Center. In exchange for space and other resources, our group will support their programming, volunteering and working with them. This will be an optional part of our project, outside of the two meeting times per week, but it will expand our resources and networks in the city by establishing relationships with these organizations.</p>
<div class=""im"">
<p>In the first weeks of the project, we'll literally make our <span class=""il"">Patchwork</span> Flag, sewing together our individual patches. Wherever we go, we'll bring the flag, making the process as visible and public as possible.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""im"">
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>These six weeks are just a beginning. We're hoping that the connections we make with each other as a group, and with people involved in other community organizations, will be the start of long-standing relationships. The project is meant to explode out, and to inspire other people to do exactly what we're doing -- coming up with an idea to promote community and innovation, and just rolling with it. Also, as of now we're planning on repeating the project seasonally or at least once a year. We'll see where this goes, but this six-week workshop will hopefully grow into a more permanent collaborative structure.</p>
<h3><strong>Who Are We?</strong></h3>
<p>We're both about to graduate from Bennington College, where we've spent lots of time studying and thinking about community, public practice in the arts, and non-traditional, hands-on education. Sara, born and raised in NOLA, studied Dance and African American Studies with a focus on Community Development, and has worked with groups including Urban Bushwomen, a dance company that focuses on social justice issues in the African American community. Ezra's from Denville, NJ, and at Bennington he studied the social function of theater and the arts, most recently working with the Los Angeles Poverty Department, a community-based theater group in Skid Row, Los Angeles.</p>
<p>As you can probably guess, both of us are fresh-faced, enthusiastic, and committed. We also have plenty of experience leading projects and working with community at Bennington and beyond. Our college incorporates a 7-week internship term into the school year, so we've each had four experiences pursuing these questions of community and learning outside of college.</p>
</div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>If you can't contribute with money, that's totally OK. Since the basis of the project is people working with each other in community and collaboration, you can be a part of that for free. Here's how:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Teach a workshop</em> -- We're still looking for someone to teach a workshop on mediation and conflict resolution</li>
<li>
<em>Barter with us</em> -- Do you have any skills, advice, or resources you think we could use? Do you need anything for your own community that we could provide? Let us know!</li>
<li>
<em>Be a part of our community</em> -- We already have a small extended family of <span class=""il"">Patchwork</span> Flag people, from folks who have picked our brains about the project to people who are full-on partners. If you're interested and you have any creative ideas about how to help, let us know!</li>
<li>
<em>Spread the word</em> -- If you know anyone who might be interested in the project in any way, please pass it on!</li>

<p>FLOW began with the dream of April Burrows, FLOW's founder, and her
determination to start a business to support small businesses and solo-preneurs
who found themselves overwhelmed or under-inspired by the day-to-day tasks of
running their businesses.  At the same time, April kept encountering
skilled and gifted women who were un- or under-employed, and looking for
challenge or meaningful work.  And so—the FLOW team was formed.</p>

through our first year in business, and we have certainly seen success. 
Our target market has welcomed us with open arms, and the work that our clients

<p>We want next year to

We love everything about Burning Man, the culture, the message, the community--and most of all, the people that make it awesome!</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435264234/twjcaaaikrcgfjdvw0fj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We'd like to burn (that might come out weird) but some of us are virgins (also, might sound weird, bear with me). The problem was, most of us hadn't a clue as to how to prepare for Burning Man. To add onto that, we'd heard countless horror stories of empty shelves and chaos at the stores when it came time to prepare. </p>
<p>You see, each year, nearly 70,000 people come to Burning for a life-changing week out in the desert, many for the first time in their lives. It literally becomes one of the biggest cities in Nevada for a short period of time. That also means a city's worth of durable desert supplies that Reno stores need to accommodate for. The week before, thousands of attendees flood the stores and camping aisles looking for the things they need. However, many people are left without the essentials to survive the harsh desert conditions, or they find them after endless hours store-hopping and stressing, hours that they could have spent enjoying the community or making their gifts. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435264284/nzdknhgo3ydhwic1g6ap.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>BurnReady aims to make this process as simple as possible. With our service, attendees will be able to order all of their survival supplies online, have it organized into one, convenient package, then just pick it up on the way to the event. It's that easy. And the best part? Most people won't want to truck back or store all of their supplies, so we came up with a solution: ReBurn.</p>
<p>With ReBurn, users will be able to sell us back certain items from their packages once they return from the event. They can get up to 10% back based on the condition of the products, as well as an in-store discount on their next package. ReBurn will allow burners to take more responsibility for their items and help them ""leave no trace"", as well as give them something back for being green. We'll reuse the stuff we can for discounted ""used"" packages next year, then recycle or donate the rest. </p>

</div></div>","Are You Ready To Burn? We are BurnReady, a team of college students from across different majors at the University of Nevada, Reno. We love everything about Burning Man, the culture, the message, the community--and most of all, the people that make it awesome!


We'd like to burn (that might come out weird) but some of us are virgins (also, might sound weird, bear with me). The problem was, most of us hadn't a clue as to how to prepare for Burning Man. To add onto that, we'd heard countless horror stories of empty shelves and chaos at the stores when it came time to prepare. 
You see, each year, nearly 70,000 people come to Burning for a life-changing week out in the desert, many for the first time in their lives. It literally becomes one of the biggest cities in Nevada for a short period of time. That also means a city's worth of durable desert supplies that Reno stores need to accommodate for. The week before, thousands of attendees flood the stores and camping aisles looking for the things they need. However, many people are left without the essentials to survive the harsh desert conditions, or they find them after endless hours store-hopping and stressing, hours that they could have spent enjoying the community or making their gifts. 


BurnReady aims to make this process as simple as possible. With our service, attendees will be able to order all of their survival supplies online, have it organized into one, convenient package, then just pick it up on the way to the event. It's that easy. And the best part? Most people won't want to truck back or store all of their supplies, so we came up with a solution: ReBurn.
With ReBurn, users will be able to sell us back certain items from their packages once they return from the event. They can get up to 10% back based on the condition of the products, as well as an in-store discount on their next package. ReBurn will allow burners to take more responsibility for their items and help them ""leave no trace"", as well as give them something back for being green. We'll reuse the stuff we can for discounted ""used"" packages next year, then recycle or donate the rest. 

We want to get Burners out into the desert and have as immediate an experience as possible. Burning Man holds a magical, special place in many people's hearts, including our own, and BurnReady aims to help share that magic and keep the experience as stress-free as possible. 
   What We Need & What You Get We're hoping to raise 15K for our service. It will go towards warehouse storage rent, truck rentals for logistics, and the supplies needed to fill our first orders for Burning Man 2015.
For your support, we want to give all the people who donated or supported us a very special gift: An e-book that showcases the marvelous gifts that people have received on the playa and beyond, with the stories and meaning behind all of them.

<h3>STOP WASTING OUR MONEY IN THE EU</h3>
<p>Did you know that each month the European Parliament, all 751 MEPs, members of their staff, members of EU bureaucracy (more than 5,000 people) move from the facilities in Brussels, to the traditional seat of the Parliament in Strasbourg for just 4 days? The cost for this move is an estimated 130-170 millions euros per month and 10,000 cubic meters of CO2 annually. It is an blunt EU taxpayers money waste issue and therefore we as liberals, libertarians need to play an active role to bring common sense back in the EU.</p>
<h3><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;'>We want to save your money wasted on one of the most absurd idea in EU. Together we can stop parliamentarians and bureaucrats from constant travel between Strasburg and Brussel. We can make them  work in one place . All we have to do is to raise a million signatures from at least 7 countries. Than we will force EU to take in on the floor and star serious debate on the waste. Start with supporting our campaign promoting our social media activities and participating in our crowdfunding. We need every euro to spread the idea and collect even more  signatures. It starts today with your one euro.</span></h3>
<p><strong>What does it mean if we succeed in raise 1 million EU signatures?</strong></p>
<p>It would mean that we, as European citizens would be able to ask of the EU to legislate an end to this waste and to publicly take a stand. This is an issue which is emblematic of EU wasting taxpayers Money. It also gives the opportunity of raising accountability, transparency and less burreaucracy inside the EU structure.</p>
<p><strong>How we will do it?</strong></p>
<p>Our crowdfunding campaign will enable us to raise funds to successfully gather the 1,000,000 signatures by launching an online campaign with Change.org and on the streets of the main cities in each participant country. This will allow us to raise awareness for the issue.</p>

<p><span>The Problem: </span></p>
<p>For women living on the border of Armenia and Azerbaijan, personal health and wellbeing are rarely a priority. Lack of employment combined with constant sniper fire makes it extremely challenging for women to stay in their homes, let alone take care of themselves. </p>
<br/><p>These women only see a doctor once they have discovered a health issue which is often already at an advanced stage. Many of these afflictions are very treatable, but only if they are caught in the beginning stages. This is why women (and men) need to take preventative measures and ensure that they are screened regularly for generic reproductive health issues. </p>
<br/><p>However, along the border there are no local health clinics that provide gynaecological services or mammograms. This means that in order to get any type of medical attention, women have to travel all the way to Yerevan, and for many this is simply not possible. </p>
<br/><p>Yet they want to stay in their villages; the places they were born and grew up and have lived their entire lives. And we want to help them. We want to make it possible for them to live happy and healthy lives with their families in their homes. </p>
<br/><p>The Solution:</p>
<p>The Berd Women’s Resource Center Foundation identified this problem and asked us at the Homeland Development Initiative Foundation to help them resolve it. If women on the border can have easier access to the tools and education they need in order to stay healthy, then it will be easier for them to stay in their homes. </p>
<br/><p>Together, we are raising the funds needed for women in the villages of Berkaber, Nerkin Karmiraghbyur, Aygepar, Movses and Berd, to be able to have access to these tools and education. </p>
<br/><p>With the money raised we will be able to bring sonography equipment to the border and over the course of several days, women will be able to come and get screened for free. If after this preliminary screening they find any irregularities, we will bring them to Yerevan for further testing.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><span>How It Works:</span></p><br/><ul>

<p>We plan to build an aluminum-bodied, all-electric concept car. We are high school students from Houston, Texas, and we have developed our vision of a radical performance car to the fullest extent that our resources will allow.</p>
<p>The project started off as a joke between friends. In an attempt to trump each other with ridiculous ideas, one member of our team suggested 3D printing a full-sized car. The idea evolved into a feasible possibility, and, within a week, our team had created a rough 3D model.</p>
<p>We have designed the car completely from scratch. It’s features are, to say the least, unconventional. It features a unique driving position and a novel steering mechanism to accommodate such a position. Accompanying, the car is a D3O padded, Nomax® driving suit to protect the driver. The car’s structural components will be made mainly from machined aluminum. Parts that are not vital to its structural integrity will be 3D printed. The electric power unit will include a Li-ion battery pack—there will be no direct emissions—and two motors coupled directly to the rear wheels. The underbody is shaped to produce actual aerodynamic downforce, and channeled air will cool the power unit. Each of our team members identifies just as much as an artist as he OR she does an aspiring engineer. So, unlike many student engineering projects, the car will look sleek and professional.</p>
<p>Now, before we can start building and testing, we have to fundraise. We don’t need much—we can produce most of our parts in house—but we need to cover the cost of materials. And, the more resources we have to work with, the cooler we can make this car. We greatly appreciate any support you can give us. We have set huge goals for ourselves, and, with your support, we have every intention to achieve them.</p>

<div>After growing hemp for the last three years, this year's harvest promises to be the most bountiful.  <a href=""https://www.winonashemp.com/hemp-plan"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I've spent the last year networking with other hemp growers and have learned a lot</a>. I’ve expanded the varieties I am growing and now have several small pilot plots of CBD and fiber varieties.  My main interest is in fiber and fabric, but I know this plant to be a medicine and want to provide this medicine to my community that desperately needs healing.  Securing seeds for fabric varieties has been especially difficult.  We are not sure if this is a result of the Trump Administration, but we have persevered.

<p>This field is where my Tribe, the White Earth Nation, planted several hemp varieties last year.  They had great success in growing, and this year, the field re-seeded itself. These “volunteer” plants are now in their second year of adaptation our northern Minnesota climate.   Some of that hemp is eight feet tall. We are now harvesting the stalks for fiber and letting some go to seed. We intend to expand these cultivars and anticipate growing wild varieties from Nebraska and Minnesota to strengthen our seed stock. Our goal is to develop quality hemp fiber varieties adapted to our climate.   </p>

<p>A generous donation from Project Earth has allowed us to purchase a small industrial decorticator --the machine needed to separate the fiber from the rest of the hemp stalk.  We will move this decorticator from farm to farm as we build a local economy, an artisan economy. Once the hemp is decorticated, we need to spin that fiber into thread-- so my new ask is to help me develop my thread mill.  I have found a perfect building for my needs- a small industrial building in Callaway, Minnesota. Callaway is on the western edge of the White Earth Reservation, near the Tribal Hemp field and a major North-South railroad line.  Callaway is also a perfect place for wind and solar power.</p>

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">About the Campaign: A Names Dictionary</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>To the Yorubas (and most African cultures), a name is not just a name. Names have meanings. Names are powerful. Names are an embodiment of history, of a family, of a lineage. (More here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_culture#Naming"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_culture#Naming</a> ). Sadly, today our names are being washed away by ""civilisation"". We are raising children who are ignorant of this power (or meaning) of their names. Soon, one child at a time, a Yoruba name will be lost. Soon, one name at a time, the significance of the naming tradition will disappear. </p>
<p>Or not! We can't let this happen. (The video above is meant to illustrate the difference between how names are written and how they are pronounced; and a popular Nigerian attitude to mispronunciation of their names).</p>
<p>This project seeks to create an online multimedia database of all Yoruba names; a place of knowledge for those who need it. People removed from their homeland can look to it and find a lost connection while those not familiar with the Yoruba culture can come there to learn about Yoruba names, spelling, etymology, meanings, stories, et al; a wiki of sorts, a free web-based multimedia repository of knowledge open to all; a dictionary; a project designed to reverse a trend and preserve a culture.<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> </span></p>
</div><div>
<p>There are some websites around right now with bits and pieces of information about Yoruba names. Most of them are either hard to use, don't have enough names in it to earn the name ""dictionary"", don't offer users a chance to add new names that the dictionary doesn't have, don't have audio links where the user can click and hear the name pronounced, doesn't have detailed description of where the name is from, what its morphological components are, or aren't dynamic enough to include modern names along with ancient ones.<br/></p>
<p>There are two parts to this project. The first part is the initial database created from easily accessible sources: books, radio, television, internet publications, twitter, visitor logs, passenger manifests, etc. The second is the crowd-sourced entries created by users around the world, which will then be vetted by other users and by site administrators. These entries will then be edited for appropriate presentation, and an audio file added, among other things. These parts are equally important to the success of the project.</p>

<h3>What the Dictionary will Look Like</h3>
<div><i>""The distinction between dictionaries and encyclopedias is not only the one that is practically impossible to make, but one that is fundamentally misconceived. Dictionaries are encyclopedias."" - John Haiman<br/></i></div>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>SEARCHABILITY: Users will be able to search for names, or add their own entries</li>
<li>ETYMOLOGY: Names will have links and information about its (ethnic and geographical) origin.</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">MORPHOLOGICAL/PHONOLOGICAL INFORMATION: Like most dictionaries, this one will have relevant morphological and phonological/phonetic information. This will be of help to linguists and other academic users.</span></li>
<li>AUDIO SOUNDS: Users will be able to click on names and hear the correct (and alternative) pronunciation. The sounds will be recorded by paid (or volunteer) voiceover artists. </li>
<li>ALTERNATE SPELLINGS: Names that have alternative spellings will be highlighted. Abbreviated names (like ""Lanre"", ""Banke"", ""Tunde"" etc) will also be defined in full.</li>
<li>SOURCE: Some names came from Arabic, Hausa, or European influences (names like ""Bakare"", ""Rasaki"", ""Alimi"", ""Buraimo"", etc). These will be highlighted with links and (web/audio/video) sources. </li>
<li>STORIES: Some names carry more than what can be gleaned from their meaning. Users who know the stories related to their names will be able to edit entries in order to include it.</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">OTHER RELEVANT CULTURAL INFORMATION will be provided, e.g songs from naming ceremonies, and other information of cultural value.</span><br/>

</div><div> <p>In total, we need $5,000, for this drive, basically to pay for the website designer, and to set up the most crucial software and hardware backbones of the project.

More names will be sought out that can capture the extent of the project and still be succinct enough to be memorable.</li>
<li>$500 will be required to pay for site hosting for five years. </li>

In 2012, I led a successful campaign to make Twitter available in Yoruba (More about that here: <a href=""http://techcabal.com/2014/11/14/twitter-yoruba/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://techcabal.com/2014/11/14/twitter-yoruba/</a>).</p><p>I've been interested in activities and projects that make Yoruba more adaptable to new technology, and conversely, those that make new technology more user-friendly to Yoruba speakers (and learners) all over the world. </p><p>My undergraduate project from the University of Ibadan (2005) is titled ""The Multimedia Dictionary of Yoruba Names"", and my masters thesis, at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (2012), focused on ""Initial Tonal Acquisition by American English Speakers learning Yoruba.""</p></div>","About the Campaign: A Names Dictionary

To the Yorubas (and most African cultures), a name is not just a name. Names have meanings. Names are powerful. Names are an embodiment of history, of a family, of a lineage. (More here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_culture#Naming ). Sadly, today our names are being washed away by ""civilisation"". We are raising children who are ignorant of this power (or meaning) of their names. Soon, one child at a time, a Yoruba name will be lost. Soon, one name at a time, the significance of the naming tradition will disappear. 
Or not! We can't let this happen. (The video above is meant to illustrate the difference between how names are written and how they are pronounced; and a popular Nigerian attitude to mispronunciation of their names).
This project seeks to create an online multimedia database of all Yoruba names; a place of knowledge for those who need it. People removed from their homeland can look to it and find a lost connection while those not familiar with the Yoruba culture can come there to learn about Yoruba names, spelling, etymology, meanings, stories, et al; a wiki of sorts, a free web-based multimedia repository of knowledge open to all; a dictionary; a project designed to reverse a trend and preserve a culture. 

There are some websites around right now with bits and pieces of information about Yoruba names. Most of them are either hard to use, don't have enough names in it to earn the name ""dictionary"", don't offer users a chance to add new names that the dictionary doesn't have, don't have audio links where the user can click and hear the name pronounced, doesn't have detailed description of where the name is from, what its morphological components are, or aren't dynamic enough to include modern names along with ancient ones.
There are two parts to this project. The first part is the initial database created from easily accessible sources: books, radio, television, internet publications, twitter, visitor logs, passenger manifests, etc. The second is the crowd-sourced entries created by users around the world, which will then be vetted by other users and by site administrators. These entries will then be edited for appropriate presentation, and an audio file added, among other things. These parts are equally important to the success of the project.


What the Dictionary will Look Like
""The distinction between dictionaries and encyclopedias is not only the one that is practically impossible to make, but one that is fundamentally misconceived. Dictionaries are encyclopedias."" - John Haiman


SEARCHABILITY: Users will be able to search for names, or add their own entries
ETYMOLOGY: Names will have links and information about its (ethnic and geographical) origin.
MORPHOLOGICAL/PHONOLOGICAL INFORMATION: Like most dictionaries, this one will have relevant morphological and phonological/phonetic information. This will be of help to linguists and other academic users.
AUDIO SOUNDS: Users will be able to click on names and hear the correct (and alternative) pronunciation. The sounds will be recorded by paid (or volunteer) voiceover artists. 
ALTERNATE SPELLINGS: Names that have alternative spellings will be highlighted. Abbreviated names (like ""Lanre"", ""Banke"", ""Tunde"" etc) will also be defined in full.
SOURCE: Some names came from Arabic, Hausa, or European influences (names like ""Bakare"", ""Rasaki"", ""Alimi"", ""Buraimo"", etc). These will be highlighted with links and (web/audio/video) sources. 
STORIES: Some names carry more than what can be gleaned from their meaning. Users who know the stories related to their names will be able to edit entries in order to include it.

OTHER RELEVANT CULTURAL INFORMATION will be provided, e.g songs from naming ceremonies, and other information of cultural value.




What We Need 
 In total, we need $5,000, for this drive, basically to pay for the website designer, and to set up the most crucial software and hardware backbones of the project. The rest, hopefully, will take care of itself (or require a different funding of its own). The breakdown is as follows:

We need $2000 to design the website (already purchased at www.yorubaname.com. and www.orukoyoruba.com). These are the best names available. More names will be sought out that can capture the extent of the project and still be succinct enough to be memorable.
$500 will be required to pay for site hosting for five years. 
$1000 will go into the purchase of audio equipment: microphones and other acoustic tools and software. A few of them are listed here:



MICROPHONE: An Audio Technica AT2020 USB Microphone:
      AT2020 Plus (or equivalent) http://goo.gl/31X7He

HAND-HELD MICS: Zoom H2N http://goo.gl/6KXR3P

ACOUSTIC SHIELD:http://goo.gl/RZgsAb 

EARPHONES: BEATS or
equivalent studio-style headphone:http://goo.gl/4O2Esu





$1500 will go to other incidentals (transportation for field workers, stipend for social media volunteers, cost of photocopy, scanning, internet, studio rentals, etc.) and also to purchase books (like this: http://goo.gl/1z5vPa and http://goo.gl/xQ6w90 and http://goo.gl/NUef5X) and other helpful materials.
However, as much as $5000 will be most helpful, this drive is set up in such a way that even if we don't reach this entire goal, whatever is raised (especially anything above $1500) will be spent to design the online database so that the project can, even as a purely crowd-sourced project, be able to kick off and build from the ground-up. 
   

The Impact
 From a micro point of view, this project provides a valuable space of knowledge for anyone interested in the structure, form, pronunciation, etymology, meaning, and style of Yoruba names. At the larger level, it is meant to start a crucial documentation process for much of our African experience. Think of future iterations: A Multimedia Dictionary of Igbo Names, Swahili Names, etc. Or, even better: a crowd-sourced Yoruba Lexical Dictionary (that captures not just names this time but all the lexical items in the language). 
In a little way, we would be saving one language from extinction (even though it currently has over 30 million speakers (ethnologue.com). As a Yoruba speaker, we would be building a valuable legacy for the coming generation, and knowledge that can prove useful for others in some other part of the world.
Like the Tweet Yoruba Project, this will be another contribution to the documentation (and eventual survival) of the language in the 21st century and beyond. Not just for Yoruba, but for indigenous languages everywhere.   
Risks & Challenges There are no risks. The project will thrive on demand. As long as people are online looking for information about the Yoruba culture, particularly Yoruba names, there will always be people using this website to share their own knowledge that can help others.

Everyday that walk down the street I see many people in need, and having been in a situation of need I understand that people need help. For every $10 that is contributed to this cause is enough to feed someone, and provide a work opportunity of 1 hour, to each $10 worth of contribution.     What We Need & What You Get  The idea is to have the necessary vehicles, and enough money to hire a lawyer, to represent us and handle all the necessary paperwork and legal issues, etc. and to lastly launch a regularly scheduled large campaign aimed at getting the city of Los Angeles clean, while providing jobs to those that deserve a chance at a better life.

The Impact  This is such a great way to give back to society as a whole, it allows people to give back without needing anything but there time to clean the streets.

So my friends and I decided to get together, to do something positive in this world to give us a brighter tomorrow.    Risks & Challenges  Dealing with the mentally ill and disabled people will be a challenge to overcome because of the high population of these groups of individuals that tend to populate the streets of LA.  Having grown up in an underprivileged background, I can relate to people on a very close level, and see people for what situations they may have experienced in life, rather than seeing people as good or bad, just an effect of the past. As funding reaches the goals necessary in order to provide at least all of the basic equipment/vehicles, and also the legal issues we will be completely self sustaining at a certain point in time, allowing us the time to spend with these mentally/disabled individuals on a much more common basis.

<p>My name is Joe Gibson I am a married father of two. I have been through stretches of homelessness in my life and I also identify as a bisexual person. I feel that any donations for any reason are welcome to people in that situation. This is an important cause because with this we can do a little good in the world and also show people that someone isn't a bad person because their lifestyle is different from theirs. I have many friends who are part of the LGBTQ community and the reaction that we all saw from people on Facebook earlier today was awful and insulting. I also promise that before any of the food goes to any church or shelter I will state that this is where the money has come from and the reasoning behind it, i will then ask them if they would be willing to accept the food on behalf of the LGBTQ community. This project will help to break negative ideas that people have about the LGBTQ community and it will shed light on the things that people have said because of a picture on Facebook.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>I'm asking for $2000 because I want this to be a sizable contribution from one group of people that are made to feel like second class citizens to another. We will be buying products from all of the brands listed here;<a href=""http://snacks.kraftfoodscompany.com/Brands/largest-brands/index.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://snacks.kraftfoodscompany.com/Brands/larg...</a></p>
<p>The shelters that will be receiving the food are going to be located in Columbus Ohio and surrounding suburbs and communities. no matter the amount of money we make together I will make sure that people are able to enjoy a meal because of your contribution and I’ll also make sure they know who it came from.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Difference We Can Make </h3>
<p>This is an opportunity to make a difference in people’s lives by showing that you support the LGBTQ community and more directly by helping to feed the homeless. Together we can show people that love is a stronger force than hate by helping these people with a meal for a day maybe more. Ignorance does not have to breed more ignorance.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Here Is another Way You Can Help </h3>
<p>If there is no way that you can help out financially just go out and tell people about this tell them what we're trying to do here that we want to help people understand that being a homosexual isn't a negative in life. if you have some spare time go to a homeless person give them a package of Oreos and tell them the story of why you're doing this explain to them that the food you just gave them is from someone that whole heartedly supports the LGBTQ community. </p>
<p>If you like this idea please help me spread the word, the more people that know means more Oreos for the homeless!!</p>

My name is Bad Wolf, and this is my dream.</p><p>Nearly four years ago, I stepped out onto the roller rink, wobbly kneed but grinning. This was the start of something great, I could tell. I hadn't been on roller skates in 20 years, but I absolutely loved it. The athleticism, the power, the badassery... going from a lifelong booknerd and self-proclaimed anti-athlete, this particular sport got under my skin and burrowed its way into my brain.<br/></p><p>And now, this business has also burrowed its way in. It competes for space in my head, with other thoughts like ""taking care of my family"" and ""maintaining good work ethic"". This shop has become my heart and soul. I spend every waking moment, and most of my sleeping moments, thinking about it.  I have wanted my own business since I was a teenager, and all my years of working retail and customer service jobs has prepped me for this moment. All these years, I believed that I wasn't smart enough or ambitious enough to do it. I've endured countless whispers of ""you won't make any money."" or ""you know it would just fail, right?"" and it's kept me from following my dream.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>I'm determined to make this a reality. I refuse to let it fail. I refuse to listen to those old voices in my head telling me I can't. When I first skittered out onto the rink, my skates slid around wildly in what I call my ""Bambi On Ice Moment."" It took months of hard work to overcome that. And now I'm back there again, in a different way. My knees are wobbly, I don't really know what I'm doing, but I know I have a fire in my heart and I won't let that burn out, just like I didn't let my derby fire burn out.</p><p><br/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span><br/></p><p>Starting a new business takes dedication, smarts, tenacity, and above all MONEY. It will take at least two grand to just open my doors. There are first and last month's rent charges, inventory to order, and advertising costs, as well as costs to file the name with the state and get a website going.<br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>There are currently 5 roller derby leagues in Portland and Vancouver, one in Salem, and two in Bend. 4 of those leagues have popped up in the last two years. Portland is becoming saturated with roller derby skaters and currently has no way to support needs.

My name is Bad Wolf, and this is my dream.Nearly four years ago, I stepped out onto the roller rink, wobbly kneed but grinning. This was the start of something great, I could tell. I hadn't been on roller skates in 20 years, but I absolutely loved it. The athleticism, the power, the badassery... going from a lifelong booknerd and self-proclaimed anti-athlete, this particular sport got under my skin and burrowed its way into my brain.And now, this business has also burrowed its way in. It competes for space in my head, with other thoughts like ""taking care of my family"" and ""maintaining good work ethic"". This shop has become my heart and soul. I spend every waking moment, and most of my sleeping moments, thinking about it.  I have wanted my own business since I was a teenager, and all my years of working retail and customer service jobs has prepped me for this moment. All these years, I believed that I wasn't smart enough or ambitious enough to do it. I've endured countless whispers of ""you won't make any money."" or ""you know it would just fail, right?"" and it's kept me from following my dream.Until now.I'm determined to make this a reality. I refuse to let it fail. I refuse to listen to those old voices in my head telling me I can't. When I first skittered out onto the rink, my skates slid around wildly in what I call my ""Bambi On Ice Moment."" It took months of hard work to overcome that. And now I'm back there again, in a different way. My knees are wobbly, I don't really know what I'm doing, but I know I have a fire in my heart and I won't let that burn out, just like I didn't let my derby fire burn out.What We Need & What You GetStarting a new business takes dedication, smarts, tenacity, and above all MONEY. It will take at least two grand to just open my doors. There are first and last month's rent charges, inventory to order, and advertising costs, as well as costs to file the name with the state and get a website going.The ImpactThere are currently 5 roller derby leagues in Portland and Vancouver, one in Salem, and two in Bend. 4 of those leagues have popped up in the last two years. Portland is becoming saturated with roller derby skaters and currently has no way to support needs. The options of ordering online or purchasing at a pro-shop in a skating rink are all severely limited. I plan to be the go to place for people who play all the different types of roller sports to make it easier and more fun to shop for gear. I will be open 6 days a week as well as online ordering options, and will be in a convenient location so you will always have an easy way to replace that missing mouth guard, or broken knee pad, or buy your first pair of skates.  If I don't get money in savings, I will still be able to get financed most likely, but that is not a route I want to take and it would mean less inventory and less capitol to work with. If I manage to raise more than the $2000 I plan to invest it into the business and ultimately won't have to borrow as much.Other Ways You Can HelpDonate anything you feel comfortable with, even $5 will get me closer to opening my doors.

<p>One year ago, Diego González, a Guatemalan student of psychology,
decided to start La Media Cancha Project to support children and teens living
in excluded communities throughout Guatemala City.</p>
<p>He started talking with the neighbors of various communities
and he found an existing soccer school started by Hedgar in the community Amparo.
Hedgar told Diego about the need of a program like La Media Cancha in the community
close by, Nuevo Amanecer. Since then they have been working with the children
in both communities. </p>

La Media Cancha brings sports and values based education to socially excluded communities in Guatemala City.Guatemala City is the 14th most dangerous city in the
world and the 5th in number of violent murders. Domestic violence, alcholism, and drug addition add to a weak local economy in creating the issues that children and teens
from El Amparo and Nuevo Amanecer, the two comunities where we work, face every day.
La Media Cancha project was created to prevent
violence in these communities and provide children and teens with another
option: sport and the opportunity to
belong to a safe, supportive and healthy group. 
The project provides soccer training
while promoting values and support through collaborative games. The start of La Media Cancha
One year ago, Diego González, a Guatemalan student of psychology,
decided to start La Media Cancha Project to support children and teens living
in excluded communities throughout Guatemala City.
He started talking with the neighbors of various communities
and he found an existing soccer school started by Hedgar in the community Amparo.
Hedgar told Diego about the need of a program like La Media Cancha in the community
close by, Nuevo Amanecer. Since then they have been working with the children
in both communities. 
Meet Axel, one of La Media Cancha`s local stars

My name is Axel, I am ten year old and I live in El
Amparo, a community in Guatemala City. Daily life here is quite hard. Most of
my friends don’t go to school because they work in order to help support their
families while others fall into drug addiction (they sniff glue) or get
involved with “maras” or “pandillas juveniles” (gangs) operating in the
community. La Media Cancha has given me the opportunite to meet friends and
spent the afternoon having fun instead of being in the street surrounded by problems, violence, and drugs.

Sport, Education, and Values




The goal of the La Media Cancha project is to contribute
to the development of children from El Amparo and Nuevo Amanecer through soccer and the values associated with the sport such as team work, camaraderie, leadership, entrepreneurship, self-esteem, and respect. Children are provided with another avenue in life which helps prevent joining gangs and offers the support they need. 
When the children arrive to the soccer field, they
first have a space where they can talk and share their day-to-day worries, then
they play collaborative games, receive tactical, technical, and physical
training and finish the day with a soccer match.

<br/><p></p><p> </p></div>","You’re just one person, there’s not much you can do in the global face of things, right? Well, no. United for Hope started with one passionate person putting everything she has into changing the lives of rural Indians. Join her, join us, in doing a little to make a big change.Photo above: Tara McCartney and the children from TirmasahunWe’d argue that making a small donation here, now, joining us at the beginning of our incredible journey, could be the most worthwhile and impactful thing you’ll ever do.
The world is imbalanced. Around the globe, there are huge disparities across food and nutrition, clean water and good sanitation, health and education: the things that many of us take for granted are often out of reach in places like rural India. All are the building blocks of family and community. They are our sustenance and our springboards to being our best selves. All we’re doing here at United for Hope is redressing the balance. It is a big challenge, but one that we can overcome if we work together.

In the last 12 months, United for Hope has built sustainable toilets for 50 families. This year, we’ll make sure the whole village has access to a toilet. We installed solar lamps along the main street to make a safer environment and gave many families solar lights – a much safer alternative to kerosene lamps. We recruited 2 additional teachers, plastered and painted classrooms and provided functioning toilets for 400 children. 

Photo above: one of the many families who now have their own toilet.We have also drilled for water, boring 120ft to find a clean, sustainable source for the entire community.And we have done all of this in full consultation with the community, encouraging villagers to take ownership of decision-making and contributing financially. You could say it’s been an education. Which is why we’re now focused on building a community centre that will really revolutionise the future of Tirmasahun.We’ve done all this in our first year, with little funds, a collaborative approach, a committed leadership and a small army of professional volunteers across Europe and India. Photo: Global Handwashing DayThe Community Centre and all associated development work will be the first of many projects across rural India, providing the blueprint that will break the cycle of poverty and educate children and adults to dare to dream of a better life.And in that context, we’ll continue to manage a project of works that aims to meet the wide variety of needs that come with holistic development. And we are succeeding. We’re emboldened by what we’ve achieved to date and we won’t stop until we do much, much more. We’re realising that the more we do, the more we can do and we’re making great strides - often with very little financial input.What we do really well is making a small amount of money go further to make the biggest impact.So you can be confident your contribution, however small, will make a huge difference. ​The project will be carried out between March and September 2015.The new Learning and Resource Centre will offer: 
• After school tuition program 

• English & computer lessons for children 

• Women’s health, hygiene & empowerment classes 

• Drop in centre for government-related issues and programs 

• Community meeting point 

• Teacher training programs 

• Adult vocational and educational training 
Photo Above: Architectural plans of our community center Our Centre will be at the heart of a strong community: a place to host community events, a citizen's advice centre, health clinics and much more.The Centre will have a deep water well on-site and be independent from the unreliable electricity grid via its own solar-powered energy system. The total cost of work is 50,000 Euros.With fundraising, we’ve secured the first 10,000 Euros toward construction and hope to raise 10,000 moreThe additional 30,000 Euros will be crowdfunded in two phases:Reaching our goal of 15,000 Euros will allow us to cover the most essential costs of the project, to include: •         Leveling the ground, and creating solid foundations•         Basic construction of a two-story building including supplies and labourThe final goal of 15,000 Euros will allow us to:•​Finish building, including fixtures and fitting•          Sanitation facilities for students and guestsPhoto above: The wall for the community center has already begun.Tara McCartney is an Irish girl living in Germany whose heart belongs to India.  Just over one year ago, she decided to ditch her comfortable corporate job to put her skills and knowledge to much better use.

Risks & Challenges
  Since this effort is being done as a not-for-profit and for the community good, it is being run with very little room for operating below breakeven.  Our biggest risk is a lack of interest from makers to become members or support from the community, which would result in a lack of funding to sustain the space. 
We have a small portion of our initial grant funding to use for operating expenses which should allow us enough time to reach sustainability.  The founding team spent time at other MakerSpaces and did financial reviews of this effort to ensure we understood our membership numbers. Our membership numbers that we need are 80 standard members based on expected expenses, but with support from the community that number could be less. 
  Other Ways You Can Help We know not everyone can contribute financially to the effort and that is OK.  If you are interested in contributing in a non-monetary way please consider: 
Post on any social media site you are part of about the space and this effort.  The more people talking about it the better.
Tell a friend who might be interested in becoming a member or contributing about the space and the effort.  Tell them why you feel the space and effort is important.

<p><b><i>       A dream ...</i></b></p>
<p>We want to create a site where people can relax under the tropical sun, away from the city, in a natural environment surrounded by greenery.</p>
<p>My name is Melissa Dauphin Johnson, I am married to Howard Johnson, an exceptional man who is also a  reggae singer who goes by  the name of King Shadrock. We have 2 wonderful children, one age 11 and the last 6 years which bite into our daily lives. My family and I lived in Montreal, where I was the community youth worker teenagers, my job was to develop these youth empowerment, self-esteem and promote their reintegration.</p>
<p>Despite the career of King Shadrock going well and the children were doing great in school, it seems that we were missing something. After several trips to Jamaica, Howard and I were considering seriously the possibility to move to Jamaica to live other experiences. That's what we did one month after our last trip.</p>
<p>Arrived on the island, we settled. My children and I discovered and adaptations to another culture and Howard rediscovered his country he left 19 years. We rented a house on a beautiful grounds in the district of Eden where we received many guests from abroad. The latter, loved and appreciate our services. They also liked to live near people of the region and to be part of the community. Another advantage was that during outings, guests can take advantage of discounts that we  could offer them as we are now citizens. All these good vibrations shared by our guests, so we had  to give the idea to benefit more people, but how? After 1 year and a half, we received an offer to purchase piece of land on the  mountain  we accept immediately. Definitely, Jamaica seemed to offer us much more.</p>
<p>We bought the land and started the cleaning work. During the work, we have realized that for a project of this scale, we needed help. It is for this reason that we start this finance campaign. </p>
<p>Contribute to this project will enable more people to enjoy this site.</p>
<p>It will also allow us to create jobs for the citizens of the surrounding neighborhoods, especially young people.</p>
<p>Have a small but growing business that will allow us to carry out several other projects.<b><i>      </i></b></p>

       A dream ...
We want to create a site where people can relax under the tropical sun, away from the city, in a natural environment surrounded by greenery.
My name is Melissa Dauphin Johnson, I am married to Howard Johnson, an exceptional man who is also a  reggae singer who goes by  the name of King Shadrock. We have 2 wonderful children, one age 11 and the last 6 years which bite into our daily lives. My family and I lived in Montreal, where I was the community youth worker teenagers, my job was to develop these youth empowerment, self-esteem and promote their reintegration.
Despite the career of King Shadrock going well and the children were doing great in school, it seems that we were missing something. After several trips to Jamaica, Howard and I were considering seriously the possibility to move to Jamaica to live other experiences. That's what we did one month after our last trip.
Arrived on the island, we settled. My children and I discovered and adaptations to another culture and Howard rediscovered his country he left 19 years. We rented a house on a beautiful grounds in the district of Eden where we received many guests from abroad. The latter, loved and appreciate our services. They also liked to live near people of the region and to be part of the community. Another advantage was that during outings, guests can take advantage of discounts that we  could offer them as we are now citizens. All these good vibrations shared by our guests, so we had  to give the idea to benefit more people, but how? After 1 year and a half, we received an offer to purchase piece of land on the  mountain  we accept immediately. Definitely, Jamaica seemed to offer us much more.
We bought the land and started the cleaning work. During the work, we have realized that for a project of this scale, we needed help. It is for this reason that we start this finance campaign. 
Contribute to this project will enable more people to enjoy this site.
It will also allow us to create jobs for the citizens of the surrounding neighborhoods, especially young people.
Have a small but growing business that will allow us to carry out several other projects.      

   What We Need 
We need for our project,  a minimum of $ 20,000 CAD for continuity.
 The money raised will:
- Pay construction materials and transportation.
- Pay people that collect recyclable materials and transportation.
- Pay workers (carpenter, bricklayer, plumber, electrician, workers).
-  purchase of food for the volunteers.
   The Impact on the community 
The realization of this project will engage young people in this district. These young people are already investing their free time because they believe in the project.
By contributing to this project, you not only help the  youth in the community to grow with an aid . You also permit the world to a unique experience.

   Challenges 

Lack of money could be crucial for our project. The temperature can play an important role.  without funding, we will still make this project but over a longer period.

<h3>Consider this</h3>
<p>Recently social tipping has exploded through outlets such as Reddit, Twitter, and Youtube, and many users see this as a great way to increase exposure to and adoption of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin exchanges have been giving out $10 for “new” user acquisition, with no specific knowledge about these users. With a national Bitcoin commercial, the community can reach just as many new, potential Bitcoiners, at a much lower cost to everyone. For example, if nine thousand members of the Bitcoin community contributed $5 each to this campaign, (the same cost to acquire one new member through social tipping), we could successfully fund the commercial and reach over TWO MILLION people. At just over 2 Cents per person, this is one of the most cost effective ways to reach new users and breaks the pattern of internet only Bitcoin advertising.

<h3>Here's our story.......</h3>
<p>14 years ago, our parent organisation set up the <a href=""http://www.theant.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the ant</a> to work on health and education in Northeast
India. <br/>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The 8 states of Northeast India - Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Meghalaya,
Tripura, Sikkim, Mizoram, and Manipur - are beautiful and culturally diverse,
but economically impoverished. <br/></p>

<p>
</p>
<p>In these predominantly rural
communities, many families own neither land nor livestock. Men are forced to
work as day laborers and women as housemaids. There is little money for
education or healthcare. Any unforeseen expense, like a family member's illness, drives the
family into debt.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>
<b>Determined to break this dependence, in 2002 Smitha Murthy, a textile designer and co-founder of <a href=""http://www.theantsstore.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Ants Craft</a>, started working with tribal
Bodo women to use their traditional weaving skills. </b>Smitha focused on creating  designs for the urban market, introducing new yarns, colors, and designs.<br/>

We return profits to the artisan community via higher wages and employing more people.  Most of our artisans are women, and the benefits of empowering women accrue to the whole family. 


We are raising $30,000 to equip a finishing unit in Bangalore to handle large export orders. LArger orders will allow us to provide sustainable employment for 15,000 artisans vs. 4,000. 
 

Here's our story.......
14 years ago, our parent organisation set up the the ant to work on health and education in Northeast
India. 



The 8 states of Northeast India - Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Meghalaya,
Tripura, Sikkim, Mizoram, and Manipur - are beautiful and culturally diverse,
but economically impoverished. 







In these predominantly rural
communities, many families own neither land nor livestock. Men are forced to
work as day laborers and women as housemaids. There is little money for
education or healthcare. Any unforeseen expense, like a family member's illness, drives the
family into debt.




Determined to break this dependence, in 2002 Smitha Murthy, a textile designer and co-founder of The Ants Craft, started working with tribal
Bodo women to use their traditional weaving skills. Smitha focused on creating  designs for the urban market, introducing new yarns, colors, and designs.







Realizing that the women needed decision making power and control over their working conditions, we set up Aagor, a weavers' collective managed entirely by women. 

Initially we marketed the garments at exhibitions. Seeing that the weavers needed direct market access, in 2007 we opened the Ants Store in Bangalore, India.  And in 2013, we began selling online at The Ants Store.







We have been successful beyond our wildest dreams!  Beginning with a small group of Bodo women weavers of Assam, today we work with 4000 artisans all over the Northeast. 
We design, produce and sell garments, jewellery, baskets, pottery, food and toiletries. All our products are Fair Trade, and our artisans are paid fair wages; no child labor is used. 




     
 








But we stand at a crossroads today. Our store and online business are both doing well, but to truly grow and benefit more artisans, we have moved from a Trust to a for-profit enterprise with the same social cause. 


To grow, we need to efficiently handle the large export orders we are already receiving from Europe and the US. Currently we receive products from the Northeast and outsource their finishing, labelling and packing in Bangalore.  We can be far more efficient if we set up a finishing unit to handle these tasks ourselves. This will cost $30,000. 








By handling bigger orders, we can employ more artisans and we expect to benefit as many as 15,000 artisans by 2019, a 300% growth in beneficiaries! We can also employ up to 20 underprivileged people in Bangalore and ensure that our entire supply chain is Fair Trade. 



Every artisan we work with has a family. The extra income pays for better food, education and health care. It helps families pay off debts and become proud owners of land and livestock.


Help us make this happen! We ask you to support our dream of sustainable livelihoods that also protect beautiful traditional crafts.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Great conversation holds the power to broaden perspectives, open minds and shape the direction of future leaders. The solutions to our most pressing issues--both worldly and personal--often stem from collaboration between trusted friends. As students at the University of Southern California taking a class called the Art and Adventure of Leadership, we enjoy the rare opportunity to talk with other students from all different aspects of campus life, whom we never would have met otherwise, about life, leadership, and our own burning questions. However, we realize that these insightful conversations don't just happen 
in every day social situations; they require a <strong><em>spark. </em></strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Because we wanted to incite the same level of valuable conversation among our peers outside the class, and truly harness the potential of our generation as problem-solvers and innovators, we created the Spark Collective Supper Club: gatherings in the vein of the Salons of the Enlightenment Europe, which convene curious and passionate friends and strangers over a casual meal for an evening of thought-provoking dialogue. The suppers we have held so far have been tremendously successful. Attendees have departed with new friends, new ideas and a strong desire to host Spark Collective suppers of their own. <br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The suppers themselves are self-sustaining (guests contribute money via PayPal to cover the cost of the meals), but the Spark Collective Supper Club depends on a complex website for functionality. As the Spark Collective has grown, we have identified the need to create a website that can manage our unique invite mechanism that ensures fresh faces at every supper, handle multiple suppers at once, and organize our ever-expanding database of supper club attendees. <br/></p>
<p></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Spark Collective Supper Club touches and changes students' lives. Engineers meet gender studies majors and get to talk about family and growing up in a way they never before experienced. Sorority girls meet ROTC guys and learn to think about war and globalization in a way they never before considered. Futures and pasts unfold on the table as the food disappears. Guests leave with their bodies nourished from a home-cooked meal and their souls enriched from caring and challenging discourse. We believe that today's fast times and rapidly paced technological diversions distract our generation's attention from the issues that matter most. The Spark Collective Supper Club creates an intimate environment where students can let go of the outside world in order to truly see it.  <br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Help us foster the next generation of leaders. Help us cultivate the inquisitive, contemplative, creative minds that will usher in the next era. We need to build our website in order to give real life and longevity to the Spark Collective Supper Club. Without a solid virtual structure, the Spark Collective Supper Club will falter and perish--especially once we, the founding members, graduate in May. One simple online hub will keep Spark Collective Supper Club members connected, hosting and conversing. We need to raise about $3,000 to hire a designer and a coder to construct an aesthetically attractive and technically adequate site. With the money we raise, we also plan to expand to other schools, uniting students from even more diverse backgrounds to engage in even deeper conversation. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>As an official student organization at USC, we have access to a few hundred dollars in start-up money from the university.

<h3>Help send us to Uganda to establish a women's empowerment and community center for the Mubende district's community social, economic and environmental development.<br/>
</h3>
<h3>
<br/><br/>This project's purpose is to empower women and alleviate poverty within the<br/><br/>Mubende District through the establishment of a community center that will:<br/><br/>1. Provide workshops in the following areas:<br/><br/>a. Women's empowerment<br/><br/>b. Environmentally sustainable and higher yielding agricultural methods<br/><br/>c. Handicraft training and marketing<br/><br/>d. Family health and planning<br/><br/>2. Serve as a communal crop storage facility.<br/><br/>3. Establish a transportation system with the purchase of a truck for the center.<br/>
</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<p>In order to see our vision through to completion, we are seeking funding to visit our target community in January to conclude our research, establish personal relationships within the region and have the most accurate information that will allow us to successfully move forward in this project's development in early 2012.<br/></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Our Story</h3>We are part of a group of Harvard graduate students who have spent the semester<br/>researching and planning a sustainable development project for the residents of<br/>Kyakatebe, Uganda in the Mubende District.<br/><br/>Lene is a biology researcher at Harvard University and a student of sustainable<br/>development. Having grown up in Norway with so much abundance, she has always felt<br/>very fortunate and desired to share with others and help the less fortunate in any way<br/>she can. When she joined the Art of Living Foundation in 2006, she knew her life path would include service projects around the world. With this project in Uganda<br/>she hopes that with Kaley, in collaboration with the Art of Living Foundation, she can<br/>make a difference for the women in Mubende and help them to help themselves out of<br/>poverty.<p><br/></p>
<p>A recent 19-year-old graduate of Boston University, Kaley is currently pursuing her<br/>Master's at Harvard and hopes to complete her thesis on gender and development<br/>work. She has traveled extensively in over 30 countries and, like Lene, wishes to help<br/>women around the world realize their self-worth and maximize their potential, as she<br/>has felt so lucky to experience so much herself in the United States.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This proposal is the culmination of a sustainable development class project that seeks to target the three key areas of sustainable development: economic, social and environmental benefits. Our immediate goal is to travel to Uganda to more effectively implement our project in a way that benefits the entire community for years to come.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div style=""font-family: helvetica;"">

This project's purpose is to empower women and alleviate poverty within theMubende District through the establishment of a community center that will:1. Provide workshops in the following areas:a. Women's empowermentb. Environmentally sustainable and higher yielding agricultural methodsc. Handicraft training and marketingd. Family health and planning2. Serve as a communal crop storage facility.3. Establish a transportation system with the purchase of a truck for the center.


In order to see our vision through to completion, we are seeking funding to visit our target community in January to conclude our research, establish personal relationships within the region and have the most accurate information that will allow us to successfully move forward in this project's development in early 2012.

Our StoryWe are part of a group of Harvard graduate students who have spent the semesterresearching and planning a sustainable development project for the residents ofKyakatebe, Uganda in the Mubende District.Lene is a biology researcher at Harvard University and a student of sustainabledevelopment. Having grown up in Norway with so much abundance, she has always feltvery fortunate and desired to share with others and help the less fortunate in any wayshe can. When she joined the Art of Living Foundation in 2006, she knew her life path would include service projects around the world. With this project in Ugandashe hopes that with Kaley, in collaboration with the Art of Living Foundation, she canmake a difference for the women in Mubende and help them to help themselves out ofpoverty.
A recent 19-year-old graduate of Boston University, Kaley is currently pursuing herMaster's at Harvard and hopes to complete her thesis on gender and developmentwork. She has traveled extensively in over 30 countries and, like Lene, wishes to helpwomen around the world realize their self-worth and maximize their potential, as shehas felt so lucky to experience so much herself in the United States.

This proposal is the culmination of a sustainable development class project that seeks to target the three key areas of sustainable development: economic, social and environmental benefits. Our immediate goal is to travel to Uganda to more effectively implement our project in a way that benefits the entire community for years to come.


The ImpactOur proposed Community Center will be a gift that will sustainably give to the Mubendedistrict, eventually leading to self-sustainability and a potential rise out of poverty.We will construct a Community and Women's Empowerment Center that aims topositively resonate through our target district, Kyakatebe, on numerous levels:empowering women toward greater skills leading to financial and political autonomy,encouraging communal development, increasing crop longevity and yieldby deliveringenvironmentally friendly methods, increasing profits by granting villagers greaterautonomy, and improving the livelihoods of all that are involved.This project is designed to respond to Kyakatebe's actual needs and include theparticipation of the entire community for its implementation, monitoring and continuation.In collaboration with the Art of Living Foundation (AOLF), an Empowerment Workshopwill be organized for the women participating in the project. The local AOLF group willfollow up and give support to the project on a regular basis to ensure the long-termsuccess and development of the project.With a well-established connection to a church community in the capital city of Kampalathrough Pastor Israel Ssekamatte, we have access to detailed information about thetarget community and resources available in the area. This will further secure propermonitoring of the project and a successful exit strategy following our contributions.What We NeedOur budget for the whole project is estimated at $28,000 which includes the purchaseof the land ($5,263), building construction ($5,500), truck to deliver goods to market($7,500 + maintainance), instructors ($3,000), center furnishings($1,000), associated fees ($300), and Miscellaneous costs.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<div>
<div>
<div>We need you to help us reach our goal of $7,000 in UNDER 20 DAYS! The $7,000 that is raised will be used for the interior renovation of the new coffee shop.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Roast is a student-led initiative to open a community-themed coffee shop on College Hill across the street from the University of Northern Iowa. The idea started with a group of students looking for a cool and creative place to hang out. The closest coffee shop to campus is 2 miles away, while The Roast will be an alternative place to socialize, study, and snack on College Hill in Cedar Falls. Unlike any other coffee shop, ours is student run and will fill the void of a local meeting place for the Cedar Falls and UNI community.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>With the combination of enthusiastic students, professional advice, and YOUR support, The Roast coffee shop will be established as the new social gathering place for the Cedar Valley in August 2012.</div>
<div> </div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>The Roast will greatly impact the culture of College Hill, the community of Cedar Falls, and the lives of the students and faculty at the University of Northern Iowa.  Without the Roast, activities on College Hill are limited to bars, restaurants and tanning salons, and we want to provide an appealing alternative to that! Not only will the Roast provide the community of Cedar Falls with a great atmosphere to study and socialize in, but it will also be an art venue for student painters, photographers and musicians.  Whether you want to stop by for a quick coffee in between classes, or just need a good atmosphere to hang out, The Roast will make that possible. </div>
<div> </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div> </div>
<div>Our main priority is to open for business in August of 2012! To do this we need help from you, fellow students, faculty and community members to ""Help the Hill"" and bring The Roast to life. The money raised through this campaign will go towards the start up costs mainly including supplies, equipment, and furniture. Other start-up costs will be obtained through private investments and a loan. The more that is raised now, the more likely The Roast will be successful in the long-run.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We've come up with the coolest and most supportive benefits possible. We want to thank you for supporting The Roast, and we want everyone to know that you were part of this endeavor to help a community in need. We need a minimum of $7,000 to get started on the interior rennovations and construction. If we exceed our goal, we can make quicker progress and get the shop here even sooner! If we  all fall short of our goal, there will still be a coffee kiosk on College Hill with the goal of eventually opening the real coffee shop. </div>
<div> </div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>If you can't donate money, we can still use your help! We need all the help we can get in spreading the word, and making some noise about The Roast!  You can impact the success of this campaign by sharing it with your friends on Facebook, Twitter, Linked-in, old-fashioned word-of-mouth, and any other way possible.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We also value your ideas and would love to hear your thoughts.  If you have an idea for the Roast or want to help in any way, let us know!</div>

</div></div>","Our Story


We need you to help us reach our goal of $7,000 in UNDER 20 DAYS! The $7,000 that is raised will be used for the interior renovation of the new coffee shop.
 
The Roast is a student-led initiative to open a community-themed coffee shop on College Hill across the street from the University of Northern Iowa. The idea started with a group of students looking for a cool and creative place to hang out. The closest coffee shop to campus is 2 miles away, while The Roast will be an alternative place to socialize, study, and snack on College Hill in Cedar Falls. Unlike any other coffee shop, ours is student run and will fill the void of a local meeting place for the Cedar Falls and UNI community.
 
With the combination of enthusiastic students, professional advice, and YOUR support, The Roast coffee shop will be established as the new social gathering place for the Cedar Valley in August 2012.
 


The Impact
The Roast will greatly impact the culture of College Hill, the community of Cedar Falls, and the lives of the students and faculty at the University of Northern Iowa.  Without the Roast, activities on College Hill are limited to bars, restaurants and tanning salons, and we want to provide an appealing alternative to that! Not only will the Roast provide the community of Cedar Falls with a great atmosphere to study and socialize in, but it will also be an art venue for student painters, photographers and musicians.  Whether you want to stop by for a quick coffee in between classes, or just need a good atmosphere to hang out, The Roast will make that possible. 
 




What We Need & What You Get
 
Our main priority is to open for business in August of 2012! To do this we need help from you, fellow students, faculty and community members to ""Help the Hill"" and bring The Roast to life. The money raised through this campaign will go towards the start up costs mainly including supplies, equipment, and furniture. Other start-up costs will be obtained through private investments and a loan. The more that is raised now, the more likely The Roast will be successful in the long-run.
 
We've come up with the coolest and most supportive benefits possible. We want to thank you for supporting The Roast, and we want everyone to know that you were part of this endeavor to help a community in need. We need a minimum of $7,000 to get started on the interior rennovations and construction. If we exceed our goal, we can make quicker progress and get the shop here even sooner! If we  all fall short of our goal, there will still be a coffee kiosk on College Hill with the goal of eventually opening the real coffee shop. 
 


Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't donate money, we can still use your help! We need all the help we can get in spreading the word, and making some noise about The Roast!  You can impact the success of this campaign by sharing it with your friends on Facebook, Twitter, Linked-in, old-fashioned word-of-mouth, and any other way possible.  
 
We also value your ideas and would love to hear your thoughts.  If you have an idea for the Roast or want to help in any way, let us know!

<p>Annie had never tasted anything as delicious as the jackfruit. Unable to understand why she had never tasted this wonderfruit before, she delved into research and began attending jackfruit festivals, conversing with jackfruit experts, and visiting jackfruit farms and processing facilities.</p>
<p>Discovering that most of India's jackfruit is simply wasted for various gaps in the supply chains, Annie decided to launch Global Village Fruits to remedy multiple problems. Preventing jackfruit wastage would mean boosting the income of farmers and processors, empowering women with paid employment, and making this superfruit accessible in her homeland.</p>
<p>We did a <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1107342386/global-village-fruits-the-worlds-best"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kickstarter campaign</a> in February 2012.

<h2>Why Indiegogo?</h2>
<p>Practically speaking, we've got a cash-flow problem. We expect to profit from sales over time, but we've got to buy our product inventory first.

<p>Which brings me to my next point--we've got a ton to do! Global Village Fruits isn't only buying, importing, packaging, marketing, and selling product. We're also conducting processing training programs and working to establish processing facilities in which we can ensure that we maximize our positive social and environmental impacts. (And we also don't yet have the cash in the bank for all of this, although we have done 12 training programs, and we know what equipment we need and where to get it.)</p>
<p>Another reason? I, Annie, am now working full-time on Global Village Fruits!!! :D!! Yep, first time in my 22 years of existence in memory that I'm not in school. I've finally got the opportunity to invest all the time and energy I have into realizing our team's dreams for Global Village Fruits. We will be fundraising in a big way (think angel investors and impact investors) after product hits shelves in August--but we need some help to get there.</p>
<p>Last reason--we believe that jackfruit is the next BIG thing. This is the beginning of our major social media campaign to tell the world about this superfruit. Spread the word--join and help us build the GVF jackfruit fan club.</p>
<h2>Rewards</h2>
<p>We hope you're excited as we are to delight in the mango-pineapple-banana taste of jackfruit! Our premiere product is dried jackfruit, packed with potassium, magnesium, and fiber. (That's it on the right!)</p>

Global Village Fruits is a for-profit social enterprise building international supply chains for undiscovered, underutilized superfruits.
We first discovered jackfruit when our founder, Annie, was working in southern India to adapt and implement a maternal and child healthcare program she, her brother, and a classmate co-founded.

It was love at first taste. 

Annie + Jackfruit = <3
Annie had never tasted anything as delicious as the jackfruit. Unable to understand why she had never tasted this wonderfruit before, she delved into research and began attending jackfruit festivals, conversing with jackfruit experts, and visiting jackfruit farms and processing facilities.
Discovering that most of India's jackfruit is simply wasted for various gaps in the supply chains, Annie decided to launch Global Village Fruits to remedy multiple problems. Preventing jackfruit wastage would mean boosting the income of farmers and processors, empowering women with paid employment, and making this superfruit accessible in her homeland.
We did a Kickstarter campaign in February 2012. Those funds lifted us up and got us going! We set up an initial website and got barcoding, insurance, packaging, product, and shipping for a sample load of jackfruit products.

<p>Joe has stood up to a Non Profit organization that is supposed to help inventors where he was working as the Director, Corporate Membership Services at the <a href=""http://us.mg205.mail.yahoo.com/company/united-inventors-association-of-america?trk=ppro_cprof"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">United Inventors Association of America</a>.</p>
<p> Joe found that this organization wasn't screening its sponsored member companies that are (invention related service providers), as they posted on their website. This meant that less than ethical companies were free to take advantage of unknowing inventors. Along with this, Joe found that its Executive Director MARK T. REYLAND was copying an inventor’s product he was supposedly a friend of. Then the UIA President WARREN TUTTLE submitted both the inventor’s product and the copycat product by Mark Reyland to the same company where he is employed as a scout.  Through that company, Warren Tuttle got The Trapdoor Colander licensed. The UIA is supposed to be a non-profit that helps inventors, not copy their products and rip them off.</p>
<p> The photo above is the copy of this product <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NU93SPoDBJY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NU93SPoDBJY</a>  made by the Executive Director MARK T. REYLAND of the UIA.  He claims to have helped get the inventor’s product to market.  That is a lie, he had no part in it).</p>
<p> Joe posted this and the information about the sponsored companies not being screened as promoted by the UIA to all 14.000 of its members in an attempt to warn the inventors of the unethical behavior of its Executive Director MARK T. REYLAND. YOU CAN READ IT HERE.</p>
<p><a href=""http://inventorswelcome.blogspot.com/2013/05/insider-blows-whistle-on-united.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://inventorswelcome.blogspot.com/2013/05/insider-blows-whistle-on-united.html</a></p>
<p>Joe's last pay check was withheld until he agreed not to post this information on LinkedIn inventors groups. The Executive Director MARK T. REYLAND demanded this of him.  Joe's own daughters earnings for scanning UIA receipts was withheld.  The $35 owed to her also wasn't going to be paid.</p>
<p> Joe has undergone 2 surgeries to his spine so far and a fusion will be scheduled soon. With all this against him, he still did the right thing and blew the whistle on this Non-profit.  It’s a long story that you can read on these blogs:   <a href=""http://inventorswelcome.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://inventorswelcome.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<p>                                    And</p>
<p>          <a href=""http://uialiesreyland.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://uialiesreyland.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<p> We are asking for help for Joe for helping us, inventor or not, it’s people like Joe that force changes and make a fair playing field for all. $25 will pay a co-pay visit to his doctor, $50 will help him feed his family, $100 will help pay the electric bill and car payment.

<div> </div></div>","Help Joe Fournier because he risked it for you and stood up and said it’s not OK to take advantage of others.
Joe has stood up to a Non Profit organization that is supposed to help inventors where he was working as the Director, Corporate Membership Services at the United Inventors Association of America.
 Joe found that this organization wasn't screening its sponsored member companies that are (invention related service providers), as they posted on their website. This meant that less than ethical companies were free to take advantage of unknowing inventors. Along with this, Joe found that its Executive Director MARK T. REYLAND was copying an inventor’s product he was supposedly a friend of. Then the UIA President WARREN TUTTLE submitted both the inventor’s product and the copycat product by Mark Reyland to the same company where he is employed as a scout.  Through that company, Warren Tuttle got The Trapdoor Colander licensed. The UIA is supposed to be a non-profit that helps inventors, not copy their products and rip them off.
 The photo above is the copy of this product http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NU93SPoDBJY  made by the Executive Director MARK T. REYLAND of the UIA.  He claims to have helped get the inventor’s product to market.  That is a lie, he had no part in it).
 Joe posted this and the information about the sponsored companies not being screened as promoted by the UIA to all 14.000 of its members in an attempt to warn the inventors of the unethical behavior of its Executive Director MARK T. REYLAND. YOU CAN READ IT HERE.
http://inventorswelcome.blogspot.com/2013/05/insider-blows-whistle-on-united.html
Joe's last pay check was withheld until he agreed not to post this information on LinkedIn inventors groups. The Executive Director MARK T. REYLAND demanded this of him.  Joe's own daughters earnings for scanning UIA receipts was withheld.  The $35 owed to her also wasn't going to be paid.
 Joe has undergone 2 surgeries to his spine so far and a fusion will be scheduled soon. With all this against him, he still did the right thing and blew the whistle on this Non-profit.  It’s a long story that you can read on these blogs:   http://inventorswelcome.blogspot.com/
                                    And
          http://uialiesreyland.blogspot.com/
 We are asking for help for Joe for helping us, inventor or not, it’s people like Joe that force changes and make a fair playing field for all. $25 will pay a co-pay visit to his doctor, $50 will help him feed his family, $100 will help pay the electric bill and car payment. This man cannot work, he is totally disabled and social Security disability takes months, if not years to be granted. His wife is the families sole support and she works endlessly and is working overtime to try and keep food on the table and pay the bills that are getting farther behind.
This is a request to do the right thing for a man that did the right thing., He took the risk and followed through while bed ridden and unselfishly put himself on the chopping block for all people that have been deceived and taken advantage of.
 And after this, the Executive Director MARK T. REYLAND posted this lie about Joe on the UIA website.  (Joe has never been convicted of a felony).  This shows just how truly unethical and unprofessional this Non-profit really is.

And the President WARREN TUTTLE allows this to happen.
 THIS WAS POSTED ON THE UIA WEBSITE TO DISCREDIT JOE FOURNIER.  IT’S 100% LIES.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p></p>
<p>My name is Becca and I own Austin Tie Dye Co. I am 29, a wife, a mother, a daughter, and most importantly a cancer survivor. At 23 year old I was diagnosed with stage III Hodgkin's lymphoma. I underwent 12 rounds of brutal chemo, lost all my hair, gained weight from the medication, and was in great pain for 6 months. Then went through 21 rounds of radiation from which I still have radiation burns. After 5 long years of remission, I was pronounced cured in September 2012. I was lucky. Not only was my cancer ""curable,"" but when I was diagnosed I had no responsibilities and was on my parent's insurance. Like I said, I was lucky.</p>
<p>Life changes when you hear the ""C"" word. Once you get over the shock of losing your hair, and facing the fact the death is a very real possibility, you are then left thinking about the financial burdon. According to the Live Strong Foundation, chemotherapy can cost up to $30,000 leaving someone without insurance or poor insurance facing a devastating decision: take the drugs to save my life and be in debt for several years, or choose not to take the life saving drugs and lose your life.</p>
<p><b>This is the project:</b> October is breast cancer awareness month. During the month of October I would like to donate $3 of every pink ribbon tie dyed shirt to Texas Oncology for their Helping Hand's Fund which provides gift cards to a well known local grocery store that can be used for food, prescriptions, gas, or to pay bills. This goes a long way for patients who are spending all their money on medical care or have had to quit or reduce their working hours because of either their treatment or the side effects of their treatment. This is my way of paying it forward. I would like to be able to donate at least $1,500 this year to these patients. </p>
<p><b>Why I need your help:</b> Austin Tie Dye Co is a brand new business and to get ready for this great donation drive I am asking for help to get the materials I need. The donations you provide will go toward high quality dyes and the chemicals needed to keep the dye beautiful forever, as well as shirts, and marketing materials to ensure the October Project donation drive is a huge success. </p>

<p>There is nothing a person can ever do to deserve sexual violence. As SlutWalk organizers, we are trying to spread that message and make a positive difference through our actions. We are in our fifth year of an initiative to bring awareness to victim-blaming and rape culture. </p>
<p><a href=""http://globalnews.ca/news/703397/1-in-5-canadians-think-women-provoke-sexual-assault-when-drunk-survey/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Today 1 in 5 people still think women are asking for sexual assault</a>. People ignore the reality that <a href=""http://aasas.ca/index.php/main/page/fact-sheet-men-sexual-abuse-sexual-assault-2010-09-24-15-09-17"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">men face sexual violence too</a> and are often not believed due to the social narrative that men want sex all the time. </p>
<p>So why is it called SlutWalk? It’s not about wanting to be a slut; it’s about that word being used to discredit victims of sexual abuse for their history, style of clothing or behaviour. If you can prove that a person is a “slut” then you have an excuse to deny their humanity. So if you want to know why it’s a SLUT walk it is because this word is being used to ignore reality, that 80% of victims are being assaulted in their own homes. To learn more about how Slutwalk originated, <a href=""http://www.slutwalktoronto.com/about/how"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.slutwalktoronto.com/about/how"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">click here</a>.</p>
<p>Historically, the term “slut” has carried a predominantly negative connotation. Aimed at those who are sexually promiscuous, be it for work or pleasure, it has primarily been women-identified people who have suffered under the burden of this label. The word ""slut"" has been used in particular to demonize and other the sexuality of women of colour, specifically by colonizers, and as such we recognize that many women may not want to reclaim the term. Whether dished out as a serious indictment of one’s character or merely as a flippant insult, the intent behind slut-shaming is always to wound. </p>
<p>We’re not standing for that anymore. On <strong>August 8th, 2015</strong> we are walking for women to be able to be seen as human beings first and foremost, with ALL victims of sexual assault being seen as deserving of equal protections under the law. </p>
<p><b>We believe in working together as a community and a part of that means showing appreciation for the efforts of others. Money isn’t everything, but it is one way we can help those who are helping us. It is important to SlutWalk Edmonton that we are able to pay our speakers and artists for their contributions.</b></p>
<p><b>In order to complete this project we need: </b></p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Funds to pay our speakers</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>Money going towards food and beverages for the event</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>Monetary donations to cover printing costs, signage and swag </b></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SlutWalk does not receive any funding from businesses, post-secondary institutions, government or large organizations so we need the support of the community in order to host the event.</strong></p>
<p>We would be most grateful if you could donate to help us implement our project. If you are interested we will keep you informed with regular updates. We look forward to working together for a world free of sexual violence, and a safer, stronger community.</p>

<br/><h1><b>We need help in completing this worthwhile project in the Rhodope mountains in the lovely village of Chepelare, Bulgaria.</b></h1>
<div>
<b></b><p><b></b></p>
<h1><b>Имаме
нужда от вашата помощ за да завършим този уникален  проект ( база  за туризъм и екстремни спортове)  в 
Родопи планина, Чепеларе, България.</b></h1>
<h1><b><br/></b></h1>
</div>
</div><div>
<b><br/></b><div>In 1897 this wonderful building was completed. Traditionally built from lime mortar and locally hewn stone, it was a community project completed for the local hunters. Over the years this building has seen many different uses but, sadly, over the last 10 to 15 years the building has fallen into a bad state of disrepair.</div>
<div>The building itself presents many challenges as we are not looking for the most expedient or necessarily cheapest options as we are looking to keep as much of the original features and materials as possible.</div>
<div>
<h4><i>През 1987 г. тази сграда е завършена за
нуждите на ловно дружество „Сокол“. Строена е по традиционни начини за времето
си от ломен камък и кирпич (като на първият етаж всички носещи колони са от
мраморни блокове). С годините сградата е била стопанисвана от много различни
домакини за различни цели, но накрая за съжаление е изоставена без домакин и за
последните 15 год. никои не се е грижил за нея, което е довело да сегашното и
състояние.<br/>Самата сграда е голямо предизвикателство за
нас, тъй като ние не търсим най-бързия или най-евтините варианти за ремонт,
напротив очакваме да  запазим голяма част
от оригиналните характеристики, материали и визия на сградата до колкото е
възможно.</i></h4>
<br/>
</div>
<h2>The Walls.</h2>
<div>At some point in its life, this wonderful building has had its beautiful stonework plastered over. We felt that they needed to see the light of day again and although the initial layer of plaster could be removed with electric tools the rest had to be done by hand with a pointed hammer to get the mortar from between the stones - a very long job.  But at least we had the weather and the views! Eventually we cleaned the lot and the building started to come back to life. And the stones are beautiful. The fixer we used to keep the old mortar together is the same one used on the Colosseum in Rome so it should last a while longer.</div>
<div>
<h2>Зидарията и стените</h2>
<p><i>Поради някаква причина през времето красивата
каменна фасада на сградата е била измазана с хоросан. Ние взехме решение отново
каменната фасада да види бял свят. Горният слой на мазилката свалихме с
електрически къртачи или по-скоро  там
където бе останала, а останалата част от хоросана които бе между фугите на камъните
отстранихме ръчно с чукчета за да възвърне каменната зидария оригиналният си
вид както едно време. Много дълга и тежка работа, но в крайна сметка след
месеци труд по фасадата сградата започна да изпъква с красотата на каменната си
зидария и се завърна за нов живот. Фиксатори за фугите от кирпич които трябва
да се предпазят от атмосферните влияния са същите с които е консервиран
„Колизеума в Рим“</i></p>
<br/>

</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h2>The Windows</h2>
<div>The windows were framed with concrete which had splintered and cracked with many of the sills missing so had to be recast then re skimmed with special exterior plaster able to stand the wide temperature swings throughout the year. It can touch minus 40 in the winter. But they certainly look better now. A lot of the timbers have rotted but we have remade them with locally sourced wood to keep the original look of the building. First they were cleaned of all the paint layers then sanded smooth and then slightly burned to highlight the features in the wood, then they were treated for insects and varnished.  Interestingly, the burning serves another purpose as the smell of the burned wood keeps the bugs at bay.This is another traditional restoration method we employ and the finish is stunning.</div>
<div>
<h2>Прозорците</h2>
<p><i>Прозорците са били обърнати с некачествен
циментов разтвор които с времето се е напукал и е паднал, както и много от
первазите липсват поради същата причина. Ние избрахме да се работи с мазилки на
варова основа които издържат на високи температурни амплитуди. Много от
дървенията по прозорците е изгнила и нападната от дървояди за това направихме
нови и ги обработихме чрез обгаряне както са правили старите дърводелци. Обгоряната
 дървесина не бива нападана от дървояди,
резултата е невероятна визия на дървото.</i></p>
<br/>

<br/>
</div>
<h2>Clearing the Soil.</h2>
<div> As the building is in a mountainous area the amount of soil and rubbish washed into the building over the last 10 to 15 years was extreme ( 250 cubic meters and counting)  and because of the location most of this had to be dug out and removed by wheelbarrow. Its a good job we had plenty of volunteers,.</div>
<div>
<h2>Изриване на сградата</h2>
<p><i>Тъй като сградата е в планински регион близо
да гора и черен път, проливните дъждовете са вкарвали земна маса и боклуци през
последните 10 – 15 години в сградата (250 куб.м. земна маса сме извадили до сега)
и заради това че се намира на скат всичко се копае на ръка и се изнася на 100
м. към черен път с ръчна количка. За тази работа ни помогнаха доста хора и
работници.</i></p>

<br/>
</div>
<h2>The Roof</h2>
<div>The roof was the major problem. The team has many skills required for this project but when it was found that we needed a completely new roof and ALL the timbers needed replacing, it was a bridge too far so we brought in  a local company. They were fantastic and gave us a great deal.  However the costs escalated to such a point that the project was in jeopardy. The team had put in  money and raised some sponsorship to do the project but this extra cost was crippling. However we now have a new roof in time for the winter, But now the project is underfunded.</div>
<div><span style=""font-size: 30px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 1px;line-height: 38px;background-color: initial;"">Покривът</span></div>
<div>
<p><i>Покривът се оказа най-големият проблем в
цялата сграда. Тимът има много от необходимите умения за да завърши този проект
но недостатъчни за да бутнем старият покрив (300 кв.м.) и да направим нов,
което се оказа задължително след разкриването му, цялостно изгнила конструкция
и изядена от дървояди, течове които през годините бяха съсипали цялостно
покрива. За това се наложи да помолим местна фирма за помощ, бяха доста
разбрани и ни дадоха добра оферта за нов покрив, но разходите ескалираха до
сума която не очаквахме и проекта се оказа в голямо затруднение. Разходи които
бяхме предвидили за др. неща влизаха в направата на новият покрив. Вече си
имаме завършен нов покрив, но недостатъчно финансиране за да довършим проекта.</i></p>

Имаме
нужда от вашата помощ за да завършим този уникален  проект ( база  за туризъм и екстремни спортове)  в 
Родопи планина, Чепеларе, България.



In 1897 this wonderful building was completed. Traditionally built from lime mortar and locally hewn stone, it was a community project completed for the local hunters. Over the years this building has seen many different uses but, sadly, over the last 10 to 15 years the building has fallen into a bad state of disrepair.
The building itself presents many challenges as we are not looking for the most expedient or necessarily cheapest options as we are looking to keep as much of the original features and materials as possible.

През 1987 г. тази сграда е завършена за
нуждите на ловно дружество „Сокол“. Строена е по традиционни начини за времето
си от ломен камък и кирпич (като на първият етаж всички носещи колони са от
мраморни блокове). С годините сградата е била стопанисвана от много различни
домакини за различни цели, но накрая за съжаление е изоставена без домакин и за
последните 15 год. никои не се е грижил за нея, което е довело да сегашното и
състояние.Самата сграда е голямо предизвикателство за
нас, тъй като ние не търсим най-бързия или най-евтините варианти за ремонт,
напротив очакваме да  запазим голяма част
от оригиналните характеристики, материали и визия на сградата до колкото е
възможно.


The Walls.
At some point in its life, this wonderful building has had its beautiful stonework plastered over. We felt that they needed to see the light of day again and although the initial layer of plaster could be removed with electric tools the rest had to be done by hand with a pointed hammer to get the mortar from between the stones - a very long job.  But at least we had the weather and the views! Eventually we cleaned the lot and the building started to come back to life. And the stones are beautiful. The fixer we used to keep the old mortar together is the same one used on the Colosseum in Rome so it should last a while longer.

Зидарията и стените
Поради някаква причина през времето красивата
каменна фасада на сградата е била измазана с хоросан. Ние взехме решение отново
каменната фасада да види бял свят. Горният слой на мазилката свалихме с
електрически къртачи или по-скоро  там
където бе останала, а останалата част от хоросана които бе между фугите на камъните
отстранихме ръчно с чукчета за да възвърне каменната зидария оригиналният си
вид както едно време. Много дълга и тежка работа, но в крайна сметка след
месеци труд по фасадата сградата започна да изпъква с красотата на каменната си
зидария и се завърна за нов живот. Фиксатори за фугите от кирпич които трябва
да се предпазят от атмосферните влияния са същите с които е консервиран
„Колизеума в Рим“






The Windows
The windows were framed with concrete which had splintered and cracked with many of the sills missing so had to be recast then re skimmed with special exterior plaster able to stand the wide temperature swings throughout the year. It can touch minus 40 in the winter. But they certainly look better now. A lot of the timbers have rotted but we have remade them with locally sourced wood to keep the original look of the building. First they were cleaned of all the paint layers then sanded smooth and then slightly burned to highlight the features in the wood, then they were treated for insects and varnished.  Interestingly, the burning serves another purpose as the smell of the burned wood keeps the bugs at bay.This is another traditional restoration method we employ and the finish is stunning.

Прозорците
Прозорците са били обърнати с некачествен
циментов разтвор които с времето се е напукал и е паднал, както и много от
первазите липсват поради същата причина. Ние избрахме да се работи с мазилки на
варова основа които издържат на високи температурни амплитуди. Много от
дървенията по прозорците е изгнила и нападната от дървояди за това направихме
нови и ги обработихме чрез обгаряне както са правили старите дърводелци. Обгоряната
 дървесина не бива нападана от дървояди,
резултата е невероятна визия на дървото.






Clearing the Soil.
 As the building is in a mountainous area the amount of soil and rubbish washed into the building over the last 10 to 15 years was extreme ( 250 cubic meters and counting)  and because of the location most of this had to be dug out and removed by wheelbarrow. Its a good job we had plenty of volunteers,.

Изриване на сградата
Тъй като сградата е в планински регион близо
да гора и черен път, проливните дъждовете са вкарвали земна маса и боклуци през
последните 10 – 15 години в сградата (250 куб.м. земна маса сме извадили до сега)
и заради това че се намира на скат всичко се копае на ръка и се изнася на 100
м. към черен път с ръчна количка. За тази работа ни помогнаха доста хора и
работници.






The Roof
The roof was the major problem. The team has many skills required for this project but when it was found that we needed a completely new roof and ALL the timbers needed replacing, it was a bridge too far so we brought in  a local company. They were fantastic and gave us a great deal.  However the costs escalated to such a point that the project was in jeopardy. The team had put in  money and raised some sponsorship to do the project but this extra cost was crippling. However we now have a new roof in time for the winter, But now the project is underfunded.
Покривът

Покривът се оказа най-големият проблем в
цялата сграда. Тимът има много от необходимите умения за да завърши този проект
но недостатъчни за да бутнем старият покрив (300 кв.м.) и да направим нов,
което се оказа задължително след разкриването му, цялостно изгнила конструкция
и изядена от дървояди, течове които през годините бяха съсипали цялостно
покрива. За това се наложи да помолим местна фирма за помощ, бяха доста
разбрани и ни дадоха добра оферта за нов покрив, но разходите ескалираха до
сума която не очаквахме и проекта се оказа в голямо затруднение. Разходи които
бяхме предвидили за др. неща влизаха в направата на новият покрив. Вече си
имаме завършен нов покрив, но недостатъчно финансиране за да довършим проекта.






Why Are We Doing This?
When this building is restored it will be;


A Hostel with room for 14 people,
A small bar and restaurant
Camping Facilities,
Children s play area.
Climbing wall for training
A center for the local hunters.
A base for Trip Elements,


This will provide much needed jobs within the local community and support local businesses as we intend to source all our supplies locally. The hostel will be furnished with Forest furniture and made entirely from locally sourced timber and labor.            

           
Защо го правим?

Когато сградата бъде реставрирана ще бъде:;
•  Планински
хотел с  14 легла
•  Бар
и ресторант 
•  Къмпинг
•  Детски
кът
•  Стена
за катерене
•  Център
за опазване на дивеча
•  Спортна
база на организацията „Trip Elements“
Нашата основна цел е да набираме местни хора
на работа, това ще осигури повече работни места и ще подкрепи местния бизнес.
Базата ще бъде напълно изградена и обзаведена от ръчно направени от нас дървени
мебели.


We are employing a local brewer to produce our own wheat beer in our own Micro brewery with a true flavor of the Rhodope mountains as all the ingredients will be locally sourced. As with the small restaurant we are looking to support local businesses as all ingredients will be sourced locally from local organic suppliers. Our menu will be small but fresh with a twist to traditional Bulgarian cuisine;

The building will serve as a base for many people to enjoy the wonderful nature of this stunning area of natural beauty and as a base camp for many activities such as hiking,climbing,  rafting, mountain biking, children's adventure holidays and of course winter sports. 

The  building will also centralize the efforts of Trip Elements. This is an organisation which provides many activities for local kids, including taking them on camping trips and training a team of young mountain bikers who regularly complete 80 Km mountain bike races. They are also organisers for national and local cycling events such as the Chepelare Tarkala. This center will enable them to further promote healthy adventures to children of all ages.
******************************
В базата ще бъде изградена малка пивоварна, в
която ще се приготвя на място собствена марка жива бира, произведена от билки и
продукти от Родопа планина.  Уютният ни
ресторант също ще предлага ястия, сготвени предимно с продукти отгледани в
Родопа планина. Менюто ни ще има кратък списък от  прясно приготвени предложения с вкуса на
Традиционната Българска кухня. 
Базата ни ще дава допълнителен уют на хората,
дошли да се насладят на невероятната местна природа и нейните богатствата.  Тя също ще предлага голямо разнообразие от
активности, на които посетителите ще могат да се насладят, като: туризъм,
катерене, рафтинг, планинско колоездене, приключенски лагери за деца и
възрастни, голямо разнообразие от зимни активности и още много други.
 Тази
база ще е център на организация „Trip Elements“, която се занимава активно и с
местните деца. Организира им палаткови излети и туристически обиколки. Има
отбор по планинско колоездене. Членовете му са над 12 годишна възраст. Те
редовно вземат участие в различни състезания по планинско колоездене в цялата
страна. Организацията също организира едно от най-интересните състезания в България
по планинско бягане, планинско колоездене и за хора в неравностойно положение –
„Чепеларски Търкала“.  
Този център ще им се даде възможност за
по-нататъшно насърчаване на здравословен и приключенски начин на живот за деца
от всички възрасти и хора в неравностойно положение. 

The Team

We are an enthusiastic team of both locals and and  emigres to this area, working with a local non profit organisation which works with children and young adults providing exciting adventure activities, We aim to restore this building to its former glory. It will be used as a small hostel, restaurant and bar with the main impetus to centralize the efforts of 'Trip Elements' the organisation responsible for so many healthy children's activities within this area. We all have experience in the building industry and have a diverse range of skills, bricklaying plastering , joinery etc. and four months ago enthusiastically set about the project.

The money is for materials as we are able to complete the project ourselves and hope, with your help, to have the center open by September 2016. 
$10.00 will buy enough to;


paint a room
buy boards for a bedroom ceiling
fabric for a bedroom
make a bedside cabinet.

$20.00 will buy

Така ние имаме нужда от вашата помощ за да
завършим този прекрасен проект. Ние все още трябва да се справим  водопровода, електричеството на вторият етажи
много др. неща.  Докато покрива беше
разкрит преживяхме сериозни  порой заради
което доста от таваните на вторият етаж паднаха и сега ще трябва да
подменим  всички. Всяко дарение, малко
или голямо, ще бъде добре дошло за да възродим тази сграда и да я върнем към
обратно към живот. Парите са изцяло за материали, без който ние не сме в
състояние да завърши проекта си и се надяваме, с ваша помощ, да  отворим центъра до септември месец 2016.
$ 10.00 ще стигнат достатъчно, за да;
Боядисаме 
стая или
Купим материал 
за таван в една стая или
Чаршафи за спалня или
Направим 
нощно шкафче.
$ 20.00 ще стигнат за :
Дървен материал за легло собствено ръчно
направено от нас или
Материали за гардероб или
Душ-батерии или
Мивка
$ 30.00 ще стигнат за:
Тръби за парно в една стая или
Дюшеме за спалня или
Материали за скрин или
Пердета и корнизи за една стая.


For larger contributors.

For $250 dollars you would be able to have one of the rooms in the hostel named after yourself or a loved one. Each bedroom will have an individual design and the room would have your chosen name on the door and be featured and referred to in brochures, online advertising, and bookings.  You will be kept up to date and given some say in the styling of that room so you know it will look great and be a relaxing and comfortable stay. Please get in touch if interested.
For $500 dollars you and a partner will be invited to be our guest for 7 nights at the hostel with  breakfast and evening meal, including I night eating traditional Bulgarian cuisine and also tasting local Bulgarian wine and, of course, rakia, and an evening of traditional Bulgarian music .

Mountain Biking
Fishing
Rock Climbing
Paintballing

Canyoning

All equipment and professional guides will be supplied by professional and registered local companies.
Obviously these are subject to availability due to the time of year. Everything will be done for you from arriving at the lodge. We will have a driver available to take you to the 4 days of activities and to take you out to local tourist attractions such as the Wonderful Bridges or The Devil's Throat on the remaining days. Really it's your choice. Follow the links and find out more. Or just contact us for details. But there are a limited number so don't miss this chance to get a vacation for a  price that will not be repeated.

и през другото време да ви отведем  до
местните туристически атракции с шофьор като Чудните мостове или Дяволското

All contributors will have exclusive and preferential information in our bi monthly news sheet which will tell the continuing story of this exciting development so you can see exactly what your money is being spent on and the progress of the project.  Also any contributor who wants to come and stay and experience this magical area will receive two and a half times their contribution towards the cost of their stay. 
                                                       *****************

За всички дарения ще имат изключителна и
преференциална информация в нашия дву- месечен информационен бюлетин, който ще
показва как продължава историята на този вълнуващ проект, така ще можете да
видите точно как и къде са похарчени парите. Също така всеки участник, който
иска да дойде и да остане и да опита от това магическо място ще получи два пъти
и половина от техния принос към своите разходи за своят престой.


    The Impact your contribution will have. Completion of this project will have many great benefits to the local community. Just one example - Kids from the locality have formed a mountain biking team and with the help of 'Trip Elements' who trained them and raised sponsorship money to get them professional competition bikes.  All those who took part, including some as young as 12, completed an 80 km cross country event earlier this year. The project will provide employment for local people and support the local economy whilst providing the opportunity for people to enjoy healthy activities in this stunning region.   

Влиянието което ще има вашият принос.
Завършването на този проект ще има много
големи ползи за местната общност. Само един пример. Децата от града са
формирали отбор на планинско колоездене и с помощта на ""Trip
Elements"", които ги обучават и търси спонсори , за да получат  професионални велосипеди и да са конкурентно
способни, ще е много по лесно след като базата вече е факт. Всички те взеха
участие, повечето на възраст 12, и завършиха 80 км. състезание по крос кънтри
по рано тази година. Базата ще осигури заетост за местното население и ще
подкрепи  местната икономика, като
същевременно предоставя възможност за хората да се радват на здрави дейности в
тази зашеметяваща област.

    Risks & Challenges I am sure that there will be challenges to come. However we feel that as we now know this building inside out the worst is behind us and we will, with some hard work and of course your help, be able to finish this wonderful and worthwhile project.
    Even if you can't contribute yourselves please let anyone you think may be able to help know about this funding proposal.

Many young people in the community although so close to the ocean, never ventured in the water or to the local skate parks. There were very few of them surfing or skateboarding.

Many were not able to afford the available lessons being offered or knew where to begin the learning process.

<p>Delicious! Community! Accessible! These three words describe everything that's great about <a href=""http://www.northamptontuesdaymarket.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tuesday Market</a>, a<span>n inspiring weekly farmers
market in Northampton, Massachusetts. For the
past 3 years, the market has accepted Food Stamps/SNAP benefits and doubled the
value of those benefits up to $10 per customer per week through our
<a href=""http://www.northamptontuesdaymarket.com/foodstampsx2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FoodStampsX2 program</a>. That means that if you swipe $10 on your EBT card, you
get $20 in Tuesday Market tokens to spend at the market every week. <br/></span></p>
<p><span>We have watched this program grow. Three years ago, approximately<b> 12 </b>people on average
came every week to use their benefits. Now <b>over 60</b> SNAP customers use the FoodStampsX2 program every week (and some weeks over 80 SNAP customers use it). Despite our successful fundraising
efforts from a family foundation, local businesses, a local bank, an <a href=""http://northamptontuesdaymarket.com/the-pie-contest"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">annual pie contest and bake sale</a>, and a number of individuals, we can’t keep up with the demand. We are asking for your help to keep this program going.  </span>
</p>
<p> We love the FoodStampsX2 program because it makes fresh, local food accessible to all community members, regardless of their income. It
also brings more income to our hard-working, small-scale farmers. Together this makes a win-win-win for
farmers, customers, and the community as a whole. <br/></p>

As Mary Cowhey, a local public school teacher and organizer says,
“If you believe in the importance of eating fresh, local food -- not just for you but for all your neighbors in the community -- <span>this is a way you can make that happen.""  <br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br/>We need to raise <b>$15,000</b> to sustain
FoodStampsX2 through another year. Any amount from $5-$1,500 will help it keep
going. Every dollar that we raise through this campaign goes directly to putting food in the hands of people who benefit from the
program. The market pays for and covers all administrative costs of running the FoodStampsX2
program throughout the year from our vendor fees. <span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">
<p>Our perks are all from the market!
Some are beautiful, some are functional, some are delicious.<span> <br/></span></p>
<p>Our bigger hope is that more and more farmers markets can create programs like ours which simultaneously support farmers and customers and lead to better supported food systems in our communities. <br/></p>
<p>Thanks for your support! Please spread the word through Indiegogo sharing tools or through Facebook or Twitter or by sending emails to people you know who think good food should be for everybody.</p></span><span class=""notranlsate""><br/><p></p>

If you would like your contribution to be tax-deductible, you can email us for details: northamptontuesdaymarket@gmail.com. 
Delicious! Community! Accessible! These three words describe everything that's great about Tuesday Market, an inspiring weekly farmers
market in Northampton, Massachusetts. For the
past 3 years, the market has accepted Food Stamps/SNAP benefits and doubled the
value of those benefits up to $10 per customer per week through our
FoodStampsX2 program. That means that if you swipe $10 on your EBT card, you
get $20 in Tuesday Market tokens to spend at the market every week. 
We have watched this program grow. Three years ago, approximately 12 people on average
came every week to use their benefits. Now over 60 SNAP customers use the FoodStampsX2 program every week (and some weeks over 80 SNAP customers use it). Despite our successful fundraising
efforts from a family foundation, local businesses, a local bank, an annual pie contest and bake sale, and a number of individuals, we can’t keep up with the demand. We are asking for your help to keep this program going.  

 We love the FoodStampsX2 program because it makes fresh, local food accessible to all community members, regardless of their income. It
also brings more income to our hard-working, small-scale farmers. Together this makes a win-win-win for
farmers, customers, and the community as a whole. 

As Mary Cowhey, a local public school teacher and organizer says,
“If you believe in the importance of eating fresh, local food -- not just for you but for all your neighbors in the community -- this is a way you can make that happen.""  We need to raise $15,000 to sustain
FoodStampsX2 through another year. Any amount from $5-$1,500 will help it keep
going. Every dollar that we raise through this campaign goes directly to putting food in the hands of people who benefit from the
program. The market pays for and covers all administrative costs of running the FoodStampsX2
program throughout the year from our vendor fees. 
Our perks are all from the market!
Some are beautiful, some are functional, some are delicious. 
Our bigger hope is that more and more farmers markets can create programs like ours which simultaneously support farmers and customers and lead to better supported food systems in our communities. 
Thanks for your support! Please spread the word through Indiegogo sharing tools or through Facebook or Twitter or by sending emails to people you know who think good food should be for everybody.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>About Kent Freshwater</h2>
<p>     My name is Kent Freshwater, and I grew up fishing. With a name like Freshwater, you have to believe that it’s meant for me to become a Kayak Fishing Guide! <br/>     I just turned 22, of course, you might be saying, “Why aren’t you going to college and trying to get a traditional job?” The truth is, I have Central Auditory Processing Disorder, so it’s really hard for me to “process” information, to sit in a classroom, to work on a computer, or to do traditional structured work. But, get me out on the water and in tune with the environment and it works for me. I have trouble talking to people about most things, but talking about fishing and telling TRUE fishing stories is easy. That’s why I am asking YOU to be my Kayak Fishing Guide launch partner.</p></span></span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span><h2>10,000 hours</h2>
<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p>     You know how they say it takes about 10,000 hours to become an expert? Well, I am sure I have 10,000 hours and then some...I am an expert at CATCHING fish. It all started when I was about four-years-old and my mom bought me a little fishing pole. You know the ones, the Spiderman pole with the fake red plastic fish on the end. I started fishing in the backyard pond and like they say, “I was hooked!” Over time, I asked for a cast net and I started learning how to throw the net and pull in the fish and bait from the pond. I pulled out a lot of Gar and Bass back then. <br/>     By the time I was eight, my mom dropped me off at the local fishing pier with a fishing pole and some shrimp for bait. That was when my fishing education began. I was lucky that the old timers on the fishing pier looked out for me and taught me how to find bait, set up my pole and most of all, how to “think like a fish!” <br/>     What do I mean when I say “think like a fish?” Well, it means I think about where the fish would be the hanging out to ambush dinner. Once I did that, I started catching fish left and right. I can catch Snapper, Sheepshead, Black Drum, Trout, Grouper, Snook, Redfish and even Tarpon. I also catch Bass in freshwater, but my business is about Kayak Fishing in saltwater in Boca Grande, Lemon Bay, Magnetos Key and the Cape Haze area of Southwest Florida. (This is the area south of Sarasota and north of Fort Myers near the mouth of Charlotte Harbor on the West Coast of Florida.)<br/></p>
<h2>Why Kayak Fishing?</h2>
<p>     Why do I love kayak fishing? When I was 15, I got an Ocean Prowler 13 kayak for my birthday. It was about $1000 to get it all set up, but my mother says it was “the best $1000 she ever spent” because I still use that kayak daily and I fish every day. I have caught monster Grouper in shallow water in my trusty kayak. (None of this spending big bucks to go out on a smelly diesel group charter boat without any guarantee of even catching a fish for me!) I have caught my legal limits of Trout, Snook, Redfish, Sheepshead, Drum...you name it, I can figure out how to catch it! <br/>Now it’s time to start earning a living with my passion for fishing! That is why I decided that becoming a Kayak Fishing Guide is the ideal way to serve and educate others about why we need to preserve our environment for the future, while also living my passion for fishing. If you know the thrill of fishing, you will understand why I am asking for your support in launching my Kayak Fishing Guide service. </p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>Back in 2010, I resigned from my job and returned to university to pursue my dream of finishing my degree. While attending university, I thought that I could be a volunteer teacher in my spare time. I searched the internet for a volunteer teaching assignment that would suit me. My thought was that I could teach art – drawing, painting and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>I came across 4dekdoi.com. I checked them out and learned that they were a charity organization aimed at helping hill tribe children at Aomkoi District, Chiangmai Mai Province, Thailand. I liked the idea of working with hill tribe children and visiting that part of my homeland. After verifying that they were a reputable group, I expressed my interest and volunteered to lend a hand. </p>
<p>While introducing myself to the group on their webpage, I met Khun Bes. He's from Northern Thailand and is fully involved in charity and volunteer work. He spends his whole year working with the group.  Either raising funds or traveling to the tribal areas and working with the children and locals to implement projects of various sorts – building and rebuilding schools, setting up generators for electricity, installing teachers for various villages, etc. <br/><br/>He asked if I would like to join his group and journey out to the hills with them. I said “yes!” and never looked back. </p>
<p>That's where's the story begins. We maintain contact via Facebook. We design and make T-Shirt for sale to raise funds. We organize over the internet and then meet in various places in Thailand and head up north three or four times a year. </p>
<p>The first project that I joined, we re-furbished the classroom and library. We also installed a new outside latrine and shower.  We brought medical treatment for the children. Each time we go, we feed the children three meals a day. This might be the only time of the year that these children eat this well. We collected clothing, books and toys to give to the children. We also play educational games. </p>
<p>All the while, we camp out in tents spending all of our time on site immersed in nature. We have to stay on site as it’s an 8 to 12 hour journey to each village and we stay five to six days each time. </p>
<p>On the first trip, we traveled to Salate School in Amkoi, Chiangmai. It was a great success. We had enough money for food and activities AND to build them two toilets. Yeah!</p>I still remember the day that we arrived. My friends and I arrived at the meeting point. We met the other volunteers who would make the journey with us from Bangkok to Chiangmai. We all came from different parts of the country. It was a great feeling to come together to do something good for people who were less fortunate than we. We loaded up and prepared everything for the journey and headed out for Aomkoi! However, the school was not in the central district. When we arrived in Chiangmai, we had to change vehicles. We needed 4WDs to get into the tribal areas. Amkoi is far into the hill tribe area. The roads are mostly mud trails through mountain passes and<br/>over ridgelines. Up the hills…down the hills…and back up again…until finally we arrived 10 hours later at our destination. It was a rough ride.<br/><p>It was great experience. The roads were mostly muddy or partially concrete but all around us was lush greenery -- the forests and jungles of Northern Thailand. We were surrounded by nature. The air was crisp and fresh. The atmosphere was peaceful and wonderful. I was so happy that I burst into tears. I was proud to have made the journey and to be in that place doing some small part to help others. I believe that all of my friends that would join in this endeavor would have that same good and wholesome feeling. It’s a fairly serious trip up to the hill tribes. One wrong turn or a slip could send us off the side of the mountain to certain doom. You need<br/>skilled and experienced drivers. The hills are very steep. The roads are, for the most part, horrendous. When you arrive, though, it’s worth every risk and every bruised body part.</p>
<p>At journey’s end, I saw a tiny roof through the forest canopy. I screamed; “Yes, we’re here.” I was a little excited. We reached the school. The villagers all came out to greet us. They helped us carry all of our cargo and bags and tents and such. The children…the children…they stood around us smiling beatifically. They were happy and shy and beautiful smiles and, oh so cute. They were simply precious. </p>
<p>We spent the next six days and five nights teaching the kids, playing games with them, building outhouses and installing plumbing, feeding the children and generally having a wonderful time. It was a much more blessed experience than I had expected. I was grateful to those children in that village. They had showed me the joys of helping others. For certain, it was a challenge. It was worth every second, every dollar or baht and every bruise and piece of paint in my hair. </p>

<h3>We would like to raise enough money to help the next village school. </h3>
<p>We usually raise around 150,000bht (5,000USD).  We would like to raise that amount for our January trip to Northern Thailand.  </p>
<p>This will allow us to re-build a school, feed the children, rent vehicles to get out to the village and provide new clothes, school supplies and toys for the children.</p>
<p>The funding will go towards food and supplies.<br/><br/>We usually feed three meals a day for two to three villages full of children for a week (300 children and their families).</p>
<p>We rent local vehicles from around Chiangmai for a week to carry us and the supplies out to the village.  </p>
<p>We purchase a years worth of school supplies and deliver them to a village.  If we have more supplies than one village school will need, we take the remainder and give them out to other villages in the Hill Tribe Area.  Last year, we were able to help several schools in the area.</p>
<p>We purchase clothing, shoes and winter coats for the children as well.  We usually purchase clothing on the Thai-Burmese border.  We can obtain mass amounts of clothing from this area fairly cheaply.  We donate all of this clothing to the children and in some cases to the local adults.  On the border, we purchase ""lots"" full of children's clothing.  However, one never knows what will be in the mix.  Any adult clothing that we obtain, we hand out at the village.<br/><br/>Last year, we had enough left over clothing to pass out to several villages along our route.</p>
<p>We also hope to raise enough funds to employ a full time teacher and teaching assistant for this village for a year.</p>
<p>We will use all funds raised to help these children.  <br/><br/>I am donating all supplies and materials for the perks as the first donation.  </p>

<p></p><p></p></div>","Back in 2010, I resigned from my job and returned to university to pursue my dream of finishing my degree. While attending university, I thought that I could be a volunteer teacher in my spare time. I searched the internet for a volunteer teaching assignment that would suit me. My thought was that I could teach art – drawing, painting and that sort of thing.
I came across 4dekdoi.com. I checked them out and learned that they were a charity organization aimed at helping hill tribe children at Aomkoi District, Chiangmai Mai Province, Thailand. I liked the idea of working with hill tribe children and visiting that part of my homeland. After verifying that they were a reputable group, I expressed my interest and volunteered to lend a hand. 
While introducing myself to the group on their webpage, I met Khun Bes. He's from Northern Thailand and is fully involved in charity and volunteer work. He spends his whole year working with the group.  Either raising funds or traveling to the tribal areas and working with the children and locals to implement projects of various sorts – building and rebuilding schools, setting up generators for electricity, installing teachers for various villages, etc. He asked if I would like to join his group and journey out to the hills with them. I said “yes!” and never looked back. 
That's where's the story begins. We maintain contact via Facebook. We design and make T-Shirt for sale to raise funds. We organize over the internet and then meet in various places in Thailand and head up north three or four times a year. 
The first project that I joined, we re-furbished the classroom and library. We also installed a new outside latrine and shower.  We brought medical treatment for the children. Each time we go, we feed the children three meals a day. This might be the only time of the year that these children eat this well. We collected clothing, books and toys to give to the children. We also play educational games. 
All the while, we camp out in tents spending all of our time on site immersed in nature. We have to stay on site as it’s an 8 to 12 hour journey to each village and we stay five to six days each time. 
On the first trip, we traveled to Salate School in Amkoi, Chiangmai. It was a great success. We had enough money for food and activities AND to build them two toilets. Yeah!I still remember the day that we arrived. My friends and I arrived at the meeting point. We met the other volunteers who would make the journey with us from Bangkok to Chiangmai. We all came from different parts of the country. It was a great feeling to come together to do something good for people who were less fortunate than we. We loaded up and prepared everything for the journey and headed out for Aomkoi! However, the school was not in the central district. When we arrived in Chiangmai, we had to change vehicles. We needed 4WDs to get into the tribal areas. Amkoi is far into the hill tribe area. The roads are mostly mud trails through mountain passes andover ridgelines.

<h3><i>Entering the Ark</i></h3>
<p><i>Dear friends,</i></p>
<p><i>I never thought I would be asking for your help in this manner and it's really a stretch for me to do this. The main Goal for this Campaign  truly, is not to stay in this particular home, for my life partner Marion and I are glad to go wherever God leads us, and in this case God has lead us to you. Our main Goal is to fulfill the Special Function we've been Given  and to Listen, Learn and Do.</i></p>
<p><i>A few years back I heard the Calling to move from Ontario to British Columbia with nothing but 2 bags of clothes and a few bucks in my bank account. I had no plans, nowhere to go past the first few days and a few supportive friends to welcome me here. Deep in my heart I knew I am sustained only by the Love of God and that I had always live by Divine Providence alone. As close friends can attest, the hardest part was to move away from my young daughter, who I love dearly, Yet if I truly believed that God is always taking care of me, it would also had to be true that God would always take care of her as well. This was my biggest test of Faith. </i></p>
<p><i>About a year later Marion and I met, united by those same principals, the same Calling, and our genuine Love for Truth. A year after we met, Marion left a successful career as a Physio in Germany and just as I was asked to do, Marion also had to entrust her only son Joshua, into the care of his other parent and both in the hands of God. </i></p>
<p><i>Being offered this place we call our Home a week after Marion first came to visit 3 years ago was only, one in a seemingly endless string of Miracles we've been showered with. Means, supplies and mighty companions have shown up in ways that are nothing but miraculous, and others have also found safe refuge here. In this slice of Heaven we call our Home where everyone is welcome.  </i>    </p>

<p><i>Marion and I do remember well hat we do not know what this is for. What we do know is that God is with us everywhere we go, and that we are happy to be wherever He would have us be, Our deep desire to learn and live in Radical Trust had not only brought us together and to you, but it had also take us to better and brighter places in the world time and time again, A sure reflection of a greater awareness of the Love of God within.</i></p>
<p><i>So, how come are we asking for your help today?</i></p>
<p><i>Well, if we are meant to move on we will move on. That is clear. And we will do so in the same Spirit of Reverence, Gratitude and Humility in which we have lived every single day for the last 3 years. And in the same way as we intend to live each and every instant for the rest of our lives.</i></p>
<p><i>If this is so, where is the problem you may ask?</i></p>
<p><i>Well of course there is no problem! Yet, we've also been Graced with a Vision for this place. And this Gift and Responsibility was received <b>before</b> we even knew this place existed and came to live here, A Vision we intend to honor in every way we possibly can and are lead to. In our false humility we never dared to believe we would be entrusted to hold the space for a Sanctuary to be built on this grounds,. Thank God we were wrong! This Sanctuary will serve to honor All Life, Our Purpose and Calling is to laid down our God given Life and dedicate it to be of Service for the Healing of Children, Wildlife, Flowers and Herbs. As we have been directed. In our Hearts, Marion and I we feel that to Heal is to Serve and to see another's best interest the same as our own. </i></p>
<p><i>We are keenly aware that, whether we recognize it or not, we ALL live our lives by Divine Providence and nothing else. Therefore, in the same way as this home away from home has been freely given to us, we intend to freely offer it to all others. We've already been doing that, on a small scale. The Model is that of a Hospice as it was Originally intended, a place for travelers to find Healing and Rest on their Path. Hopefully this Sanctuary/Hospice will bring them Home as well through Forgiveness. That's not in our hands, what is in our hands is to be willing. And willing we certainly are!</i></p>
<p><i>There is also huge potential to develop a ""business branch"" that will help us offer free access to more people. As well as to expand by building simple structures to accommodate visitors along the coastline adjacent to our kilometer long driveway.</i></p>

<p><i>We know is in your Heart to give, for we are not different at all.

Thank to DASHUB, I had no need any more to print everything and to take it with me. I continually had at hand y my confirmation emails for our flights, the contacts for the villa renting, and the car renting, an access map, and   also links to recommended excursions, restaurants, walks, and locations to visit. I even scanned our passports. No worries, with DASHUB, everything was organized through extremely simple tags accessible in a single click. <b>»</b></p></blockquote>

<b>«</b>  I'm 70 ans and I'm still active as a consultant; I <b>inform myself on a</b> <b>daily basis</b> on topics closed to my business. I gather my information from newspapers, blogs and different specialized web sites and through targeted notifications.
<br/>
Some articles are worth keeping, I want to be able to read them on different occasions: what should I do?
<br/>
Everything must be simple for me, <b>really simple</b>, fast and easy to index and to retrieve ; my laziness and my experience have been both seduced by DASHUB: a single click on the owl, a dialog box appears, simple and <b>efficient. </b>A single field to fill with the topics and its tags and it is done, I can move to something else !

► What is DASHUB?


The Internet is becoming your desktop. How should you save your digital files ?  How can you hope to  keep track of all the many interesting people in social networks? Do you want to be notified when one of your sources talks about one of your favorite  topics? Do you need to centralize everything worth keeping in a single place? How can you easily retrieve  what you need just when you need it?Up to now, there has been no single tool to help you store video clips found on YouTube and to merge them with interesting pictures found on Pinterest or with an article on a blog.  No one tool  to easily organize your emails, your .pdf files, and all your other online findings into dedicated folders.Now DASHUB can do it!DASHUB is a web application that can be connected to your web browser, mailbox, or Dropbox account. It works on your computer, on your tablet, and even on your smart phone.

You can save anything you want on the web (pages, video, tweets, Facebook posts, etc).
You can connect your mailbox and Dropbox and save  important files or emails to DASHUB.

You can organize  all of them by tags and by folders. 

You can easily continuously monitor sources of information. The source can be specific users on Facebook, specific people  on Twitter, or specific web sites. Defined your topics, and be notified when someone is talking about them.

► Testimonials
Johanna Viejo : director at Netoptic SA
«What are the benefits of DASHUB for our design team?:

 All our inspirations in any formats in a single place.

 Easy, fast & efficient way to share dynamically our data, even remotely.

 A look & feel allowing an analysis at first sight.

 Very efficient technical support.


DASHUB is an ideal tool for a creative team. It allows us to archive our inspirations from any sources, to organize them, and to visualize them in a practical and efficient way. A real support for creativity.»

Laurent Munster : project Manager at Banque Privée Edmond de Rothschild Europe S.A.« I have recently used DASHUB to group the information about a family trip to Guadeloupe. Thank to DASHUB, I had no need any more to print everything and to take it with me. I continually had at hand y my confirmation emails for our flights, the contacts for the villa renting, and the car renting, an access map, and   also links to recommended excursions, restaurants, walks, and locations to visit. I even scanned our passports. No worries, with DASHUB, everything was organized through extremely simple tags accessible in a single click. »
Claudine Fraiture : general Director at North Atlantic Consult SA 
«  I'm 70 ans and I'm still active as a consultant; I inform myself on a daily basis on topics closed to my business. I gather my information from newspapers, blogs and different specialized web sites and through targeted notifications.

Some articles are worth keeping, I want to be able to read them on different occasions: what should I do?

Everything must be simple for me, really simple, fast and easy to index and to retrieve ; my laziness and my experience have been both seduced by DASHUB: a single click on the owl, a dialog box appears, simple and efficient. A single field to fill with the topics and its tags and it is done, I can move to something else !

Benjamin Damien : freelance Biotechnology Professional
« DASHUB helps me to keep track of the torrent of information I'm encountering every day in my favorite topics in science and economics, and to easily record  and tag them with a simple right-click. It makes the tasks of documenting and participating  in discussions a much easier achievement. »
Damien Soudant : project manager at JFX finance
« I need to document myself regularly on my sector and DASHUB allows me to store, organize, and filter all the documentation that I found with just two clicks.  The tags system is very well thought out, the integration to my web browser is extremely practical, and it is quick to use. DASHUB is simple, user-friendly, and efficient! Wherever I am, I never lose my precious research, a significant saving in time. »

Forming a company to start selling DASHUB.
Enhancing the mobile versions, creating apps that could be easily found on the different mobile markets for Apple iOS and Android..

New languages, I would like to translate DASHUB into different languages so people all around the world could use it.

« J'ai récemment utilisé DashHub pour regrouper toutes les informations rassemblées en vue d'un voyage en famille en Guadeloupe. Grâce à Dashhub, plus besoin de tout imprimer et tout amener avec soi, j'avais sous la main en permanence mes mails de confirmation pour nos vols, les contacts pour notre location de villa et voiture, les plans d'accès, mais aussi des liens vers des excursions recommandées, des restos et balades à faire, les sites à visiter. J'ai même scanné et rassemblé dans mon DASHUB la copie de mon permis de conduire et de mon passeport. Zéro tracas, avec DASHUB tout est classé via un système de Tags ultra simple et accessible en un clic. Et un soucis de moins afin de partir en vacances l'esprit libre . . .»

Claudine Fraiture : présidente de North Atlantic Consult SA 
« J’ai 70 ans et suis toujours active en tant que Consultant ; je m’informe  journellement  sur les sujets proches de mes affaires par la Presse , les blogs , différents sites spécialisés  et via des notifications ciblées .

Certains articles , de qualité , valent la peine d’être archivés , je veux les consulter à d’autres occasions: que faire ?

Pour moi , cela doit être simple , très simple ,rapide ,  facile à indexer et à retrouver ; ma paresse et mon expérience ont été toutes les deux séduites par DASHUB : un clic sur le Hibou , j’ai une « dialog box » , bien présentée et claire , une case à remplir avec le sujet et sa classification et c’est fini , je passe à autres chose ! » 

Benjamin Damien: consultant scientifique en Biotechnologie

« DASHUB me permet de garder traces de mes sujets favoris en science et en économie dans ce torrent d'information. Je peux facilement les enregistrer et les tagger avec un simple clique droit. Cela rend beaucoup plus facile ma tache de documentation et d'argumentation dans les discussions.»

J'ai besoin de me documenter régulièrement dans mon métier et dashub me permet de ranger, classer et filtrer toute la documentation que je trouve en deux clics.
Le système de tags est très bien pensé, l’intégration à mon navigateur est super pratique et me permet une utilisation rapide. DASHUB est simple, intuitif et efficace!

All over the world. Sadly, only a handful of those were memorable experiences. Often, I wasted both time and money on ""grandmasters"" or champions who didn't inspire or improve me at all.
But I learned. 
I took notes. 

And I did a LOT of research.

So believe me when I say this:KNX14 will be unlike any other seminar you've ever attended.(Otherwise, what's the point?)

We will NOT be doing five hundred sit-ups.


We will NOT be doing two hundred punches in horse stance.


And no - we will definitely  NOT be doing meaningless choreography (""kata""), just so you can forget it the next day.

(However, on the last day I will introduce a kata I learned in Okinawa from a previously secret family-style of Karate.)So listen up:If you're a Karate Nerd who loves experiencing new things, improve your Karate, kick ass & have fun - this is for YOU.We will live together (single & double rooms, breakfast buffet included), train Karate together (explore modern scientific principles & ancient Okinawan Karate concepts) and last but not least - have tons of fun together!All you have to do is get your ticket and come to Frankfurt.But hurry - there are only 36 spots available!""Sounds great!

<p><strong>BE™</strong> is a low-calorie, fiber-rich coffee that mixes completely with cold milk or water. By controlling the serving size, YOU manage the level of flavor, the fiber, and most importantly, the calories. You have the power to create, change, and enjoy your own unique flavor every time. BE™ has been researched and developed by an experienced Italian and French inventor who is passionate about the individual coffee experience.</p><br/>
<h2 style=""color: #bd955a;"">Your Time is Valuable</h2>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Viberation™ Technology</strong> eliminates the brewing process, giving you refreshing immediate iced or hot coffee that dissolves completely in seconds. Full diagram description of Viberation™ technology further down in the campaign!</p>

<br/><br/>
<p>We spent nine years of intensive research and development - starting with a simple idea: How to combine natural flavors and functional benefits, allowing consumers to experience them just the way they wish. We found the answer in our unique protected encapsulation technology, which we originally called EP3 (Encapsulated Powder 3 - Sparkling (whenever needed) + Flavor + Functional benefits).</p>
<p>However, EP3 is much more than just a smart technology, it allows our consumers to take full control over their beverage consumption. They can be the final decision maker on how to use a product and are becoming once more the final designer of the “fabric”. We call it <strong>“Viberation™: La Renaissance because it is all about Experience &amp; Inspiration”.</strong></p>
<p>Viberation™ is pure taste, which will stimulate your taste buds, make them vibrate and buzzing with excitement. After consumption we want you just to BE and feel all the positive VIBES released, so we simply called the new product line ViBErant™ in order to link the feeling of simply being with the self-determination of a free creation.</p>
<p>All along this intensive development processes, we validated and confirmed each single step of our innovation with a large community of important US brands and renowned retailers, making sure we will bring to you the most desirable and intriguing product range.</p>

We completed several test runs to find weak spots in our production process and fix them before entering into full production. Our team has numerous years of experience bringing complex products to market and great relationships with our qualified manufacturers, who fully understand the ins and outs of producing our products. We have in addition aligned ourselves with high-quality vendors to ensure all components are delivered on time. All test runs were funded with our own capital beforehand and we are very confident in our abilities to move forward with this project.</p>

By controlling the serving size, YOU manage the level of flavor, the fiber, and most importantly, the calories. You have the power to create, change, and enjoy your own unique flavor every time. BE™ has been researched and developed by an experienced Italian and French inventor who is passionate about the individual coffee experience.
Your Time is Valuable

Viberation™ Technology eliminates the brewing process, giving you refreshing immediate iced or hot coffee that dissolves completely in seconds. Full diagram description of Viberation™ technology further down in the campaign!


We spent nine years of intensive research and development - starting with a simple idea: How to combine natural flavors and functional benefits, allowing consumers to experience them just the way they wish. We found the answer in our unique protected encapsulation technology, which we originally called EP3 (Encapsulated Powder 3 - Sparkling (whenever needed) + Flavor + Functional benefits).
However, EP3 is much more than just a smart technology, it allows our consumers to take full control over their beverage consumption. They can be the final decision maker on how to use a product and are becoming once more the final designer of the “fabric”. We call it “Viberation™: La Renaissance because it is all about Experience & Inspiration”.
Viberation™ is pure taste, which will stimulate your taste buds, make them vibrate and buzzing with excitement. After consumption we want you just to BE and feel all the positive VIBES released, so we simply called the new product line ViBErant™ in order to link the feeling of simply being with the self-determination of a free creation.
All along this intensive development processes, we validated and confirmed each single step of our innovation with a large community of important US brands and renowned retailers, making sure we will bring to you the most desirable and intriguing product range.

<h3>Our Mission!</h3>
<p>Penda Health is raising $30,000 to rennovate and operate a new outpatient clinic in Nairobi. The new clinic will provide essential outpatient services, with an emphasis on family planning and women's health, at prices affordable to lower and middle income Kenyans.</p>
<h3>Impact!</h3>
<p>This clinic, at full capacity, will serve over 30,000 Kenyans a year, and over 1 million Kenyans in 20 years! </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1250.photobucket.com/albums/hh527/pendahealth/Slideshow/Picture1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The $30,000 will help Penda buy necessary supplies, such as lab materials, drug stock and raw materials to build and open the clinic and fund 2 clinicians and 2 receptionists for 7 months. After that point, the clinic will be able to sustain itself!</p>
<p>Penda has a proven track record of delivering affordable, high-quality care! We opened our first clinic this February, and have since seen over 1,100 patients. Not only have we catered to a significant amount of patients, but  99% would recommend Penda to a friend!</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1250.photobucket.com/albums/hh527/pendahealth/Slideshow/Optimized-IMG_2694.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3 style=""color: rgb(0, 204, 204);"">Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi there! My name is Tiffany Christner.  I am a wife to a wonderful 
husband and a mother to two incredible twin boys, who have inspired me 
to design the Buggy Bench.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>After I had my twin boys, I quickly realized how much I had to depend
 on others to help me do things.  I remember lying in bed one night 
wondering how I was going to go to the store the next day to get my 
food.  Not only did I worry about one of them falling out, but there was

</div></div>","Our Story
Hi there! My name is Tiffany Christner.  I am a wife to a wonderful 
husband and a mother to two incredible twin boys, who have inspired me 
to design the Buggy Bench.

After I had my twin boys, I quickly realized how much I had to depend
 on others to help me do things.  I remember lying in bed one night 
wondering how I was going to go to the store the next day to get my 
food.  Not only did I worry about one of them falling out, but there was
 no place to put the groceries, and you can only fit so much under the 
cart.  I absolutely despise using the stretch-limo sized carts that are 
hard to maneuver and difficult to find at some stores.


I began thinking of how I could keep my second child safe and seated 
in the cart. Not only for the convenience of shopping, but for the 
safety of my child.  Fact is, an average of 20,000 children go to the 
emergency room each year from falling out of carts!

I knew I had to think of something to help me and all the other moms 
out there with 2 or more children. Which brought me to design the buggy 
bench.  Itâ€™s nice to know that I can get my shopping done with my twin 
boys being safely seated in the cart.

Safety For All Children

The great thing about the Buggy Bench is that it is not for just 
twins!  I see moms all the time with their toddlers in the basket of the
 cart and their babies buckled in the front or vice versa.  The Buggy 
Bench can also be used if you have one child.  Germs cover the shopping 
carts that your little one is touching, the buggy bench can be used and 
washed whenever needed.

It is designed to conveniently fit into your diaper bag, and more 
importantly, to make your out of the house experience more enjoyable.  
From one mom to the next, trust me, you wonâ€™t be disappointed!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>With over ten years of vacationing and traveling extensively throughout Costa Rica, Joe and Gina Downes are pleased to offer their unique perspective of this beautiful country with <em>AWAY WE GO- COSTA RICA TOURS</em>.</p>
<p><em>AWAY WE GO</em> combines the rare natural beauty of Costa Rica with worry free escorted travel.  Over the years, our Costa Rica adventures have taken us down the road less traveled.  Choosing towns and villages more for their beauty and uniqueness rather than their tourism trade, staying in small family owned hotels rather than Americanized “all inclusive” compounds, and dining in locally owned and operated restaurants-enjoying the fresh regional bounty offered. <strong>Getting off the beaten path to truly experience the real Costa Rica is the <em>AWAY WE GO</em> experience</strong>.</p>
<p>When exploring this alluring country with us as your guides, you will experience breathtaking waterfalls, gaze at behemoth volcanoes, and explore pristine beaches. You will discover the beauty of Costa Rica ’s National Parks, enjoy the thrill of zip lining through the lush canopy of the rainforest, and enjoy a relaxing soak in the natural volcanic hot springs . Expect to be awestruck by scenic vistas, spectacular churches, and savor amazing authentic cuisine – you’ll see it all, and meet a lot of friendly folks along the way. We offer our clients a travel experience that will last a lifetime, while creating repeat customers and a wealth of referrals.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In creating <em>AWAY WE GO-COSTA RICA TOURS</em> we intend to share our love and extensive knowledge of this beautiful country with travelers that want an <strong>authentic experience</strong>. All too often, we have seen “foreigners” come to Costa Rica and never actually experience Costa Rica!  Tourists are picked up from the airport and whisked away to an “all inclusive” compound never to be seen or heard from again.  Our unique perspective on vacationing in Costa Rica is to take small groups of customers and their referrals on personalized, authentic journeys to experience the true beauty and adventure of Costa Rica.  We already have a healthy list of satisfied clients who are referring us to their friends. At this point we are fielding inquires and doing our best to keep up with the interest that is organically growing by word-of-mouth about our personalized tours. Because of natural interest and continued inquires all the signals are pointing to us taking this to the next level.</p>
<p>We are not ""ecotourism"", nor are we “budget” travel, and we don’t do “extreme”. What <em>AWAY WE GO</em> offers is a comfortable, casual, and authentic trip around Costa Rica that fits the time frame available. Our focus in starting <em>Away We Go - Costa Rica Tours </em>is to share an overview of the country with first time visitors: those that may be feeling a little out of their comfort zone in a foreign land and not fully aware of all the right places to see, be and experience. And at the end of the journey our guests leave with an appreciation of this beautiful foreign land, its culture, and its people.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>At this point in the <em>AWAY WE GO</em> project, we have contracted a fleet of three vehicles, each to accomodate different size groups.  The largest vehicle is able to take up to 10 passengers per tour. We have established firm relationships with six “home base” hotels. We’ve solidified partnerships with restaurants and excursion operators for specialty pricing and preferential treatment of our guests. Over the years, we have mapped the most scenic, entertaining, and least stressful tour routes for our customer’s maximum enjoyment.</p>
<p>We are now at a critical point in taking this project from concept to company. To ensure success we need a creative and dynamic website with relative links and SEO/SEM optimization. For clients that request printed pieces we’ll need a compelling brochure, we’d prefer printable PDF brochures off the site but there are still some folks that want literature through the mail. We are aware of the huge value of social media, after all we have a ground swell of interest from word-of-mouth, and will utilize Facebook, Twitter and Youtube out of the gate as well as choosing the proper media mixture within the tourism industry to promote the project.</p>
<p>To that end, we have teamed with MAD-WIT, found on the web at <a href=""http://www.mad-wit.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""color: #0000ff;""><span lang=""EN"">www.Mad-Wit.com</span></span></span></a><span lang=""EN""> - a young, hungry, creative marketing team poised to put <em>AWAY WE GO - COSTA RICA TOURS</em> on the map.

Victims of the Ebola Crisis in Sierra Leone</b></p>
<p>We seek to raise
funds to send to a remarkable Sierra Leonean man. He is standing by to provide
support to those who are most vulnerable to Ebola. All he needs is financial assistance.</p>
<p>The Rev. Moses
Frederick Khanu is a minister in the Wesleyan Church of Sierra Leone. He lives
and works in Makeni, Sierra Leone’s fourth-largest city. Rev. Khanu is the
Assistant Head of his church in Makeni and supervises church activities in six
districts.</p><p><b>Moses is working with orphans, quarantined families and survivors to offer vital support. We've already started to help him increase his efforts within his vast community. With your help Moses and his team of ministers and volunteers can help save the lives of children and bring dignity back into the lives of Ebola victims. This crisis is escalating. People are terrified. Your contribution will have immediate impact. We know you will help Moses. </b></p>
<p>Rev. Khanu is not
just a minister. He also has advanced training in research and gender studies. He
has researched the situation of widows and girl mothers following Sierra
Leone’s civil war, as well as the victims of female genital mutilation. Rev.
Khanu describes his life mission as follows: “<i>As a minister, my greatest burden in life is to fight against injustice
that women and children encounter in society and to care for vulnerable people</i>.”
</p>
<p>Here is how Rev.
Khanu describes the situation facing people in the Makeni area of Sierra Leone:
“<i>The most vulnerable category of persons
include: Those who have contracted the disease; People in quarantined homes; Children
and widows of the deceased; and Persons who have recovered from the disease. All
of these people need financial support. To raise money for this people will be
great. I can receive this money on their behalf and disburse it accordingly</i>.”</p>
<p>Rev. Khanu has been a
friend and research colleague of Marc Sommers since 2005. Many times in the
field, I have witnessed his gift for communicating empathy and inspiring trust
with underclass Sierra Leoneans, including former boy and girl child soldiers,
prostitutes and other outcast youth. </p>
<p><b>Now he needs our help. <i>Urgently</i></b></p><p><b>The Ebola Situation in Mekeni, Sierra Leone</b></p>
<p>A week ago, Rev.
Khanu describes the situation in Makeni in the following way: “<i>Of all Districts in Sierra Leone, Makeni has
the fifth-highest number of people infected with Ebola. There are 106 confirmed
cases, 29 probable cases, 43 deaths, 37 probable deaths and 7 who have been
fully treated and have survived the virus</i>.” 
It is likely that these numbers are in reality much higher. People are
hiding family member who contract the disease and not reporting deaths for fear
of reprisals and stigma, which can affect their ability to get food and
essential commodities to live.</p>
<p>Moses went
on to say:</p>
<p>“<i>Although every effort has been put in place
to the Ebola situation, many challenges remain. They include: </i></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b><i>Denial/Ignorance</i></b><i>. This is the biggest
challenge. Many affected communities and homes associate Ebola with witchcraft.
In a nearby village where 40 died in a week, survivors contended that sorcery,
not Ebola, caused the deaths. This militated against any preventive measures. A
similar response arose in a Makeni neighborhood after seven people died on a
recent Sunday. There are many other cases as well. More effort is needed to fight
against the denial and increase awareness among the people.</i></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b><i>Inadequate Support to
Quarantined Homes</i></b><i>. After a home is quarantined due to Ebola infection, food
is supplied to household members. Unfortunately, the food often is inadequate.
There even have been allegations that some people, especially children, dying
because of starvation. </i></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b><i>Inadequate Hand
Washing Materials</i></b><i>. Hand washing is the greatest preventive measure against Ebola
infection. To do this properly, people require rubber gloves, soap and
chlorine. However, most homes and public centers do have these materials. </i></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b><i>The High Cost of
Living</i></b><i>. Shutdowns across the country because of Ebola has caused
the prices of essential commodities is skyrocket. This makes it very difficult
for people to cope. </i></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b><i>Stigma after
Discharge from Hospitals</i></b><i>. Some infected persons have recovered from the disease and
have been discharged from hospital. Unfortunately, such persons have not been
accepted back in their homes and communities. They seem to be stigmatized, and
are treated like pariahs. Finding a source of livelihood for such people is difficult.
</i></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b><i>Care for Orphans and
Widows</i></b><i>. There is no organized intervention to care for the orphans
and widows of people who have died from Ebola. Providing care and support to
them is a serious challenge</i>.” </p>
<h2>How the funds
will be used</h2>
<p><b>We seek to raise at
least $2,000 – hopefully much more </b>– to send to Rev. Khanu. He is how he
intends to use the funds we send to him: “<i>The
most urgent need is providing food to those in quarantined homes, hand washing
materials, and support to widows, orphans and those who have recovered from the
disease</i>.”</p>
<p><b>Please give
what you can – and check in for reports on how your money is spent</b></p>
<p>Let’s all contribute
funds so that people victimized by Ebola swiftly receive our support. In the
words of Rev. Khanu: “<b><i>I will do my utmost
to ensure that the intended purpose of the money is met. Please extend to those
who will be contributing my sincere thanks and appreciation. God bless them
all. I will document and send reports on how the money is spent</i>.”</b></p>
<p>We will post reports
here from Rev. Khanu when they arrive. </p><br/></div>","Help Us Provide Direct Support to

Khanu describes the situation facing people in the Makeni area of Sierra Leone:
“The most vulnerable category of persons
include: Those who have contracted the disease; People in quarantined homes; Children
and widows of the deceased; and Persons who have recovered from the disease. All
of these people need financial support. To raise money for this people will be
great. I can receive this money on their behalf and disburse it accordingly.”
Rev. Khanu has been a
friend and research colleague of Marc Sommers since 2005. Many times in the
field, I have witnessed his gift for communicating empathy and inspiring trust
with underclass Sierra Leoneans, including former boy and girl child soldiers,
prostitutes and other outcast youth. 
Now he needs our help. UrgentlyThe Ebola Situation in Mekeni, Sierra Leone
A week ago, Rev.
Khanu describes the situation in Makeni in the following way: “Of all Districts in Sierra Leone, Makeni has
the fifth-highest number of people infected with Ebola. There are 106 confirmed
cases, 29 probable cases, 43 deaths, 37 probable deaths and 7 who have been
fully treated and have survived the virus.” 
It is likely that these numbers are in reality much higher. People are
hiding family member who contract the disease and not reporting deaths for fear
of reprisals and stigma, which can affect their ability to get food and
essential commodities to live.
Moses went
on to say:
“Although every effort has been put in place
to the Ebola situation, many challenges remain. They include: 
· 
Denial/Ignorance. This is the biggest
challenge. Many affected communities and homes associate Ebola with witchcraft.
In a nearby village where 40 died in a week, survivors contended that sorcery,
not Ebola, caused the deaths. This militated against any preventive measures. A
similar response arose in a Makeni neighborhood after seven people died on a
recent Sunday. There are many other cases as well. More effort is needed to fight
against the denial and increase awareness among the people.
· 
Inadequate Support to
Quarantined Homes. After a home is quarantined due to Ebola infection, food
is supplied to household members. Unfortunately, the food often is inadequate.
There even have been allegations that some people, especially children, dying
because of starvation. 
· 
Inadequate Hand
Washing Materials. Hand washing is the greatest preventive measure against Ebola
infection. To do this properly, people require rubber gloves, soap and
chlorine. However, most homes and public centers do have these materials. 
· 
The High Cost of
Living. Shutdowns across the country because of Ebola has caused
the prices of essential commodities is skyrocket. This makes it very difficult
for people to cope. 
· 
Stigma after
Discharge from Hospitals. Some infected persons have recovered from the disease and
have been discharged from hospital. Unfortunately, such persons have not been
accepted back in their homes and communities. They seem to be stigmatized, and
are treated like pariahs. Finding a source of livelihood for such people is difficult.

· 
Care for Orphans and
Widows. There is no organized intervention to care for the orphans
and widows of people who have died from Ebola. Providing care and support to
them is a serious challenge.” 
How the funds
will be used
We seek to raise at
least $2,000 – hopefully much more – to send to Rev. Khanu. He is how he
intends to use the funds we send to him: “The
most urgent need is providing food to those in quarantined homes, hand washing
materials, and support to widows, orphans and those who have recovered from the
disease.”
Please give
what you can – and check in for reports on how your money is spent
Let’s all contribute
funds so that people victimized by Ebola swiftly receive our support. In the
words of Rev. Khanu: “I will do my utmost
to ensure that the intended purpose of the money is met. Please extend to those
who will be contributing my sincere thanks and appreciation. God bless them
all. I will document and send reports on how the money is spent.”
We will post reports
here from Rev. Khanu when they arrive.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>A bit about Us</strong></p>
<p>  My sister Mackenzie and I, Samantha, both current university students are partnering with the Oneida first Baptist Church on the Oneida native settlement near London Ontario to offer a summer camp to youth and programs for young adults during the upcoming summer.  I have worked and volunteered at Oneida over the past two years and feel strongly that many of the children’s needs in the community can be met through a safe and fun camp environment.  By hiring Oneida teenagers and young adults as camp counsellors the need for jobs is also being addressed.  This group of young and passionate youth will be integral in creating a camp environment that meets the unique cultural needs of the native community and offers children an experience they have not been afforded in the past. </p>
<p>   Donations will help cover the school rental fees, the food for the daily programs, the craft and sport supplies that will enhance the program, the counsellors’ pay and also the cost of bussing students to the school from across the settlement.  The cost of sponsoring a child to attend camp for one full week is $35.00. My work at Oneida has led me to meet the most loveable group of children that are simply hungry for fun and interaction, and they flock to youth night or the one week of SPARC camp where they know this is a promise.  I would simply like to offer them these experiences every week of the summer, not just one.</p>
<p><strong>Our vision</strong></p>
<p>  To run camp the way we envision it would mean securing the school on the settlement as a location for our programs, bussing the children to and from the school, feeding everyone breakfast and lunch, and offering a salary to our hired Oneida young adult counsellors.  This wish list is costly, requiring seven thousand dollarsto run 4 full weeks of camp for 50 kids. The more accessible we can make camp and the more needs we can meet in the community be it the need for safety, for food, for fun or for a job, the more valuable the initiative becomes to the community.  Partnering with prominent figures within the Oneida community, the principal of Standing Stone Elementary School, the leaders of the Oneida First Baptist Church and some Band Council Members, this is an initiative that the community supports and welcomes.  Children have a right to have their physical, developmental, emotional and spiritual needs met, and your donations to help run summer camp at Oneida will help us achieve that. </p>
<p><strong>What you get for your Support </strong></p>
<p>  We are looking to raise $750 dollars through this campaign, money that will be used to acquire a bus to transport kids to and from camp.  We are diligently seeking other avenues to cover the other associated costs, but for donating through our campaign on Indiegogo there are perks you can claim as a thank you for your support. For donations of 35 dollars perhaps you’d like a picture for your fridge drawn by the child you've been able to send to camp, or a friendship bracelet crafted during one of our camp activities. We will also send you a personalized thank you card if you would like for any donation amount.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>  Whether you have been to summer camp or not many would probably agree that some of our fondest childhood memories take place in settings that encourage fun, play, friendships and new experiences.  Summer camp at Oneida will provide a safe environment for children while their parents work, will foster positive relationships with peers and role models, and will encourage learning through half days of activities that develop language and literacy skills.  Similar to the youth nights we currently run once a month for the youth grade four and up, there will be an endless amount of games and sports, crafts and drama games, meals provided daily and character building conversations and activities that will translate much further than the two months of summer camp.  Since beginning at Oneida two summers ago I have seen enrollment nearly double to eighty children at the one week camp run by SPARC, a summer camp I worked as a manager at in 2011 and 2012.  At Oneida there is a need, there is a desire and there are countless children who desire nothing more than a chance to experience camp like many children in the GTA are privileged enough to have within minutes of their homes.</p>
<p><strong>Other ways You can Help out</strong></p>
<p>  With an initiative like this there are so many ways to get involved past financial donations.   Perhaps you have the means to make a donation of food, or of craft supplies.  Perhaps you have time to canvas around local business and organizations to ask for their consideration of supporting our efforts to bring camp to Oneida.  Just as important, you may have the time to spread the word about our campaign.  Social media sites are great ways to do so, and Indiegogo provides share tools to do so.  Word of mouth is just as appreciated.  However you are able to help make our initiative a reality and help us bring camp to Oneida is appreciated!</p>

I’m Australian born; a flamenco dancer/teacher by profession. I have Scottish, German and Motu heritage. I'm 50 years of age, and live in Sydney, Australia.<br/><br/>My story points to the Motu people, the tribes which inhabit 13 villages in the narrow tropical savannah region of Central Province, Papua New Guinea.<br/><br/>My Motu descent is through my mother, Hane Igua Hila, a Motuan from Hanuabada village. My mum is fiercely proud of her ancient heritage and the cultural traditions that are part of her direct experience. In her youth she watched her grandmother making clay cooking-pots on her lap; she was transitioned from wearing grass skirts every day to wearing cotton dresses; and she bears the traditional body tattoos of her people.<br/><br/>Although I’m proudly born and raised Australian, I also deeply treasure my Motu ancestry and am fortunate to have been brought up bi-lingual and bi-cultural.<br/><br/><b>My concerns:</b><br/>Sadly, mum’s culture has been seriously eroded since it was first exposed to foreign influence over 100 years ago. Ever since then the Motu have grown to de-value their ancient cultural practices. But they've lost enough. They need to re-value the knowledge and skills they've refined over thousands of years that are now on the brink of extinction. They need to believe that traditional practices can co-exist with modern lifestyles, or even to evolve with them. If work like mine is left much longer I fear this will very soon lead to irreversible cultural loss as elders who know the details die out. Cultural loss has a profound impact on the social fabric of a people.<br/><br/>I cannot sit and watch this culture die off.  I have the commitment and drive to bring about change - all I need is community funds to enable my planned work.<br/><br/><b><br/>This is what inspired my initiative - the project I've called, 'GIDA'.</b><br/><br/>'<i>Gida</i>' is the Motu word for ‘embers’, implying that the cultural traditions that have subsided to embers can either be left to die down to cold coals, or actively fanned back into flame.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>SPECIFIC FOCUS FOR THIS PROJECT: MOTU POTTERY</b><br/><br/>Many aspects of traditional Motu culture are endangered (eg the language, herbal medicine, children’s games etc), and they are all interlinked somehow, but the most urgent need is to save the endangered pottery tradition from extinction. <br/><br/>Mrs Boio Moi is the last surviving potter in Boera (one of the 13 Motu villages). She embodies the final connection to the practice. The need to save her knowledge is critical, not just for Motu people, but for the bank of knowledge and achievement that is the heritage of all humans.<br/><br/><br/><b>WHY IS POTTERY REVIVAL SUCH A BIG DEAL?<br/><br/></b>There are many ways that the revival of Motu pottery can contribute to <b>overall</b> cultural well-being:<br/><br/><b>• To empower women</b> by establishing a <i>Women’s Pottery Society</i> managed by women, the traditional caretakers of the industry, returning to them the status that was once their birthright.<br/><br/>• <b>Village workshops will be established through the Pottery Society</b>, for women to teach traditional pottery skills.<br/><br/><b>• Intercultural opportunities exist</b> for non-Motuans to attend such workshops, which can be developed to include broader Motu village experiences, such as family stays or traditional fishing expeditions.<br/><br/><b>• Pots made at the workshops can be marketed</b> for sale and exhibited in galleries as Motu works of art - existing outlets will be enriched, and new outlets can be created.<br/><br/><b>• Youth will be specifically targeted and involved,</b> as I plan to negotiate the introduction of Motu pottery into the school curriculum; their involvement with pottery production at home will also give them a strong sense of inclusion, identity and pride in the village context.<br/><br/><b>• A TV programme of inspired cookery and nutrition will be launched</b> to encourage the use of non-toxic traditional cooking-pots as desirable and preferable to aluminium pots.<br/><br/><b>• Attendant small business will emerge</b> - for instance clay collection, processing and supply.<br/><br/><b>• I envisage the revival of traditional trade partnerships</b>, for example with the Kerema people of the Gulf who traditionally traded sago and other goods in exchange for Motu pottery - this was the former Hiri trade event carried out via lagatoi boats, but today this could be interpreted by motor boat or land vehicles, opening up entrepreneurial avenues for transportation/cargo businesses.<br/><br/><b>• I also see the creation of an annual Motu Pottery Festival</b> in villages featuring thatch stalls where potters exhibit and sell their wares to tourists amid traditional feasting and celebration. The reliable influx of visitors will provide opportunities for villagers to sell a diverse range of items, eg craft goods and Motu food. <br/><br/><b>These are just some ideas which also encourage the preservation of other traditional practices such as singing and dancing, traditional jewellery and adornment.<br/><br/><i>The scope is enormous, and the potential for social repair and empowerment is immeasurable.</i></b><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>WHAT WE NEED:</b><br/><br/><b>Budget: AUD$31,370 </b><br/>This will enable me to take a small team of four people (2 researchers + 2 technicians) from Sydney to Boera for a month to document the details of Motu pottery construction, and to record the oral history of Mrs Boio Moi. I will produce a two video documentaries: one, a short general interest video, and the other a detailed technical video for training purposes for use in Gida's implementation programmes.

<p>My rugby career started by chance. I wandered into my university's team practice and asked to play. The moment I walked onto my first pitch, I fell in love with
the sport. Rugby is an amazing game played by amazing people. Rugby is incredibly
challenging and even more rewarding. This past year my hard work and dedication paid off when I had the amazing opportunity to train at the Olympic Training Center. I was also named a  2014 Pacific Mountain Rugby Conference all-star and a Junior All- American. In Spring 2015, I will be playing rugby in France while studying at <em></em>l'Institut d’Études Politiques  in Paris. In Summer 2015, I plan to travel to Tanzania to establish the first Dare Rugby team.<br/></p>

<p>Rugby is very popular in Tanzania,

Project is to engage with the community and share rugby with girls who have the

<p>The need for this project is born from
how critical a girl’s youth is to her future. Young women in Tanzania are faced with

give young women the rugby experience so they can gain inspiration,
self-discipline, and self -confidence through this amazing sport. The core values

that the game and its values will have a positive impact on the girls and the
community of Arusha, Tanzania. </span>

Karibu! (Swahili for hello).  Hi everyone, my name is Sophia Cole. I am a junior at the University of Colorado, Boulder studying International
Affairs and French. In partnership with Dare Women's Foundation in Arusha, Tanzania, I am starting a project to make rugby accessible to Tanzanian girls. I first met the executive director of the Dare Women's Foundation, Maggie Duncan Simbeye, at the Conference on World Affairs in Boulder, CO, where I was her student-ambassador.  Since then, I have been working with Maggie to establish what is now the Dare Rugby Project.

My rugby career started by chance. I wandered into my university's team practice and asked to play. The moment I walked onto my first pitch, I fell in love with
the sport. Rugby is an amazing game played by amazing people. Rugby is incredibly
challenging and even more rewarding. This past year my hard work and dedication paid off when I had the amazing opportunity to train at the Olympic Training Center.

In Spring 2015, I will be playing rugby in France while studying at l'Institut d’Études Politiques  in Paris. In Summer 2015, I plan to travel to Tanzania to establish the first Dare Rugby team.
Why Rugby?  


Rugby is very popular in Tanzania,
however, the opportunity for girls to play is rare. The goal of the Dare Rugby
Project is to engage with the community and share rugby with girls who have the
passion but no outlet.  
The need for this project is born from
how critical a girl’s youth is to her future. Young women in Tanzania are faced with
a great number of financial, physical, and psychological adversities.  In the face of these hardships, Dare Rugby will work to
give young women the rugby experience so they can gain inspiration,
self-discipline, and self -confidence through this amazing sport. The core values
of rugby are teamwork, respect, enjoyment, discipline and sportsmanship. I hope
that the game and its values will have a positive impact on the girls and the
community of Arusha, Tanzania. 

The Dare Woman’s Foundation is
spreading news about conservation, education birth control, and nutritional
education. The Dare Rugby Project is one of many components of The Dare Woman’s
Foundation designed to improve the lives of the young women of Tanzania. 



What We Need: 

The Dare Rugby team is 22 girls strong. The first Dare Rugby team will play for two months in Summer 2015. 
The monthly cost to the Dare Foundation is $20 per girl, the girls attend free of charge.

• $1,400 for personal airfare to and from Tanzania
• + Fundraising costs 
The total funds needed for the Dare Rugby Project is $3,400.
In the event we do not reach our $3,400 goal, Dare Rugby will still go on. We will put to use what is raised. Every donation helps!

<h3>What are we?</h3>
<p class=""p1"">Roaring Brook Market is a sustainably-minded local foods grocery store and café in downtown Lancaster. In addition to stocking traditional grocery items, we will be featuring local and seasonal breakfast and lunch options in our cafe. </p>
<h3 class=""p1""><strong>Who are we?</strong></h3>
<p class=""p1"">Roaring Brook Market is the manifestation of a community-driven food movement. Sarah, Trex, Drew, and Rachel recognized the need for a local food outlet and came together through their shared passion for Lancaster city and belief in the revitalizing power of local food. The market will source goods primarily from within Lancaster and it’s neighboring counties, though our definition of local extends to an 100 miles radius the city. Customers can look forward to seeing grocery items, fresh produce, dry goods, and home and body care products on our shelves, as well as breakfast, lunch, coffee and to-go items in the café.  </p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Why Contribute?</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class=""p1"">In order to make this dream a reality, we need monetary support from the community to purchase the necessary equipment to make a grocery store and café operate.

</div>
<div>
<h3>Where does the money go?<span style=""font-size: 10px;""><br/></span>
</h3>
<p class=""p1"">By donating to the campaign, supporters will help Roaring Brook purchase refrigeration equipment from which grocery items will be sold, ranging from produce to meat, to dairy and eggs.

<p class=""p1"">We are also commited to offering our farmers, growers, and suppliers fair and equitable prices for their goods. In order to do this, we need to raise money for our start-up inventory.

<h3><strong>What we need:</strong></h3>
<p class=""p1"">Roaring Brook is on its way towards its full opening but is still short $15,000-$20,000 of the necessary funds for opening.

<h2>Our Best <strong>Chance For Relief?<br/></strong>
</h2>
<p align=""center""><b>UPDATE: An anonymous $10,000.00 has been received directly and forwarded to our attorney.<br/></b></p>
<p align=""center""><b>A Message from Common Decency, Inc. founder, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Rexxfield.FreeSpeechV3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Michael Roberts</a></b></p>
<p>RipOffReport.com's owner, Ed Magedson,  
has made a big mistake! The federal law that has protected him from 
defamation liability in the past does not apply to this new case. WE 
NEED YOUR HELP! This might be our only chance to save victims of his website 
for good.</p>
<p>Court Documents can be downloaded at <a href=""http://authorizedstatement.org/ripoffreport.com-documents/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the bottom of this page</a>.</p>

<h2>CommonDecencyInc.org  vs.  RipOffReport.com <br/>
</h2>
<h4>[Arizona Case: CV2013-012986]<br/>
</h4>
<h3>The Goal: Gain Control of RipOffReport.com and Gag its Owner Ed Magedson </h3>
<p>Common Decency, Inc. exists in its present form for 
one purpose and one purpose only. Our mandate is to bring relief to the 
1,000,000+ innocent victims of RipOffReport.com and its owner Ed 
Magedson by suing him for more money than he has, and then levying 
ownership of the Ripoffreport.com website domain or to force them to change their business
practices.  This can be achieved by a counter claim to the lawsuit he has apparently filed against me in Arizona, although I have not been served and DO NOT acknowledge service.</p>
<p><b>BUT I CAN NOT CARRY THIS BURDEN ALONE.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We are pooling resources with other victims to create
 a legal battle chest. You can help by donating to the legal 
fighting fund, every penny will be directed to the legal battle 
through our attorney's trust account. Paypal submissions will also be forward entirely to the trust account.<br/></p>
<p>For transparency, a full accounting of every penny 
received and expended will be published each month (with privileged information
redacted). Contributor 
identities will be redacted to protect them from Ed Magedson's revenge 
(unless you wish to be identified).</p>
<b></b><p></p>
<p></p>
<h4>What's in it for Us?</h4>
<p>RipOffReport.com agents will probably claim that we will use your 
donations personally; but not a penny will be diverted from the fight for a Ripoff Report Revolution.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h4><b>Consider it a Loan, not a Donation:</b></h4>
<p></p>
<p>I'd rather not rely on charity, I am willing to work for the financial support you provide. If you are a victim of Ripoff Report, and if you make a donation, then I will provide investigative or litigation support services for you as payment for your support. I have provided pro bono (free) help for over 180 internet harassment victims in the last four years because they could not afford to pay for services.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>Why is this Lawsuit Different?</h4>
<p>Unlike other lawsuits, Ed Magedson &amp; his company are not shielded by <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hjdopsyXOY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">47 USC § 230C of the Communications Decency Act</a><br/><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>Magedson to Face a Jury?</h4>
<p>Magedson has never faced a jury because he settles. We won't settle for  less than a revolution. There is a reason why he hasn't faced a jury, they will see right through him, and he knows it!<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>Help Fund this Fight!</h4>
<p>Donate to this legal fund and every penny will be used  to save victims of RipOffReport.com.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>How are Donations Used?</h4>
<p>Donations are used to offset expenses related to attorneys, digital forensics, forensic accountants, private investigators, etc.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>What  if we Win?</h4>
<p>Every dollar donated to the legal fighting fund will be matched dollar for dollar from any judgment we receive to establish a ""Common Decency Trust"" to help other victims of Internet harassment and defamation.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<h4>How Will We End the ROR Reign of Terror?</h4>
<p>Ed made a strategic error in registering  RipOffReport.com  to the same company that  injures  many good people. We hope to levy ownership of that domain as part of any judgment satisfaction.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<h4>What about the Real Scammers?</h4>
<p>Ed Magedson has lost all claims to social heroism because he chooses a “we do not remove complaints” policy. Although his site may expose real scammers, the hundreds of thousands of innocent collateral damage defamation victims is not acceptable.<br/></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Finally, Ed Magedson Will Face a Jury! No Section §230c Immunity this Time</h3>
<p>This lawsuit against Ed Magedson and 
RipOffReport.com is unique because Ed Magedson has personally libeled   
me and my company Common Decency, Inc and others. (This is assuming we raise enough money to file a counterclaim)</p>
<p>Ed Magedson has also allegedly hired, or otherwise engaged a man named
 Darren M Meade who, by his own admission in a deposition last year, is a
 paid Internet reputation-hit-man. Because Darren M Meade has been 
acting as an agent provocateur for Ed Magedson, the latter cannot claim 
to be merely a conduit and thus, is not immune to liability under §230(C) of the
  Communications Decency Act.</p>
<p>
</p>
<div> Ed Magedson has engaged 
Darren Meade as his agent and spokesman. Consequently both he and his 
company Xcentric Ventures, LLC are liable for every word printed by 
Darren Meade on RipOffReport.com.
                
                <p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>(3) How Will the Money be Used?  </h3>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>Donations WILL NOT be used
 for director salaries!</p>
<p>As Common Decency, Inc. founder, I have
 independent income and provision (although it has been severely reduced due to the Ripoffreport.com lies).</p>
<p> All donations/subscription will be 
consolidated into the civil litigation  effort against Ed Magedson and his company 
Xcentric Ventures DBA RipOffReport.com and his co-defendants.</p>
<div>
<h3>(4) What will Happen to the Money if We Win the Lawsuit?</h3>
<p>On the assumption that we prevail and damages are
 recovered from Ed Magedson and/or his company Xcentric Ventures, LLC,  
then every dollar donated to the legal fighting fund will be matched 
dollar for dollar from the proceeds of the damages recovered by way of a
 donation to the soon-to-be established “<strong>Common Decency Foundation</strong>”.
  This foundation will help fight other battles in the future where 
unscrupulous website operators, like Magedson, take advantage of 
loopholes in the law to conduct what is tantamount to legalized 
extortion.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>(5) But How Does this End the Anguish Caused by RipOffReport.com ?</h3>
<p>Part of its legal battle will involve a <em>financial colonoscopy</em>
 of Ed Magedson and his company Xcentric Ventures, LLC.. For example, if
 his assets are in his mother’s name or a trust, then we will pursue an 
asset that is worth much more to this planet than hidden money; and that
 is the actual RipOffReport.com domain. As you can see in the following 
link, he made a strategic error in registering that domain to the same 
company that offends and injures so many good people. Ownership of the 
RipOffReport.com domain is our target and our promise to the world is 
that we will pursue that asset with all the gusto we can garner. <br/></p>
<p><a href=""http://whois.domaintools.com/ripoffreport.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Domain Ownership Record for Ripoffreport.com.</a><br/></p>
<p>But we 
need your help!  Please join the “Common Decency Army” and help in the 
following ways: </p>
<ul>
<li>Financially through donations to this legal fighting fund<br/>
</li>
<li>By flooding the social networks with news of this battle </li>
<li>By tweeting, liking and subscribing to our social networking community.  </li>
<li><a href=""https://twitter.com/RipOffReportVic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Follow us on Twitter</a></li>
<li>
<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/RipOffReportRevolt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Like us on Facebook</a><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p> In order to prevail in taking
 ownership of this domain, we need to be awarded a judgment for 
financial damages in excess of what Ed Magedson can pay. At that point, 
we will be able to file a motion with the court in an attempt to levy the domain 
ownership as part payment of his damages debt. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>My promise to the world is this-- if we prevail in court, and if we are 
successful in levying the domain ownership, the website will be shut down and the 
only thing that will be visible will be an illustration 
depicting Ed Magedson bound and gagged. Furthermore, we promise, if 
possible, to open the log files for every Ripoff Report ever made to 
reveal the identities of the not-so-anonymous authors of the complaints.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These promises are not just 
empty words; as CEO of Common Decency, Inc., I will bind the company, 
and myself as plaintiffs in this case, to the rest of the world with a 
covenant binding us to these conditions. If you give to this cause, when you click “confirm”, you will be 
effectively executing the contract with me so that these promises are 
binding.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>(6) But Doesn’t RipOffReport.com Expose Some Real Scammers?</h3>
<p>Yes it does, but is the cost of this benefit too high?</p>
<p></p>
<p> It should be said that there are presumably tens of thousands of genuine scammers who are exposed 
through the RipOffReport.com website. However, the adage  <i>“you can’t 
make an omelette without breaking eggs”</i> does not hold water when the 
cook is Ed Magedson. </p>
<p>Ed Magedson has lost all claims to social heroism because he chooses a “<em>we do not remove complaints</em>”
 policy, even when unimpeachable evidence is available to vindicate the 
falsely accused victims of his website. Free speech is not free! It 
always costs someone. If it costs a bad guys, then great; but if it hurts the 
innocent then it is bad for people.</p>
<p><b>NOTE RE MEDIA: </b>Journalists in 
the past have pumped up Ed Magedson's narcissistic supply by embracing 
him as a media darling and social champion, whereas, he is in our eyes an <a href=""http://authorizedstatement.org/ripoffreport.com-documents/define-terrorist-ed-magedson-ripoff-report.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">emotional terrorist</a>.

Our Best Chance For Relief?

UPDATE: An anonymous $10,000.00 has been received directly and forwarded to our attorney.
A Message from Common Decency, Inc. founder, Michael Roberts
RipOffReport.com's owner, Ed Magedson,  
has made a big mistake! The federal law that has protected him from 
defamation liability in the past does not apply to this new case. WE 
NEED YOUR HELP! This might be our only chance to save victims of his website 
for good.
Court Documents can be downloaded at the bottom of this page.



CommonDecencyInc.org  vs.  RipOffReport.com 

[Arizona Case: CV2013-012986]

The Goal: Gain Control of RipOffReport.com and Gag its Owner Ed Magedson 
Common Decency, Inc. exists in its present form for 
one purpose and one purpose only. Our mandate is to bring relief to the 
1,000,000+ innocent victims of RipOffReport.com and its owner Ed 
Magedson by suing him for more money than he has, and then levying 
ownership of the Ripoffreport.com website domain or to force them to change their business
practices.  This can be achieved by a counter claim to the lawsuit he has apparently filed against me in Arizona, although I have not been served and DO NOT acknowledge service.
BUT I CAN NOT CARRY THIS BURDEN ALONE.

We are pooling resources with other victims to create
 a legal battle chest. You can help by donating to the legal 
fighting fund, every penny will be directed to the legal battle 
through our attorney's trust account. Paypal submissions will also be forward entirely to the trust account.
For transparency, a full accounting of every penny 
received and expended will be published each month (with privileged information
redacted). Contributor 
identities will be redacted to protect them from Ed Magedson's revenge 
(unless you wish to be identified).


What's in it for Us?
RipOffReport.com agents will probably claim that we will use your 
donations personally; but not a penny will be diverted from the fight for a Ripoff Report Revolution.

Consider it a Loan, not a Donation:

I'd rather not rely on charity, I am willing to work for the financial support you provide. If you are a victim of Ripoff Report, and if you make a donation, then I will provide investigative or litigation support services for you as payment for your support. I have provided pro bono (free) help for over 180 internet harassment victims in the last four years because they could not afford to pay for services.





Why is this Lawsuit Different?
Unlike other lawsuits, Ed Magedson & his company are not shielded by 47 USC § 230C of the Communications Decency Act





Magedson to Face a Jury?
Magedson has never faced a jury because he settles. We won't settle for  less than a revolution. There is a reason why he hasn't faced a jury, they will see right through him, and he knows it!





Help Fund this Fight!
Donate to this legal fund and every penny will be used  to save victims of RipOffReport.com.





How are Donations Used?
Donations are used to offset expenses related to attorneys, digital forensics, forensic accountants, private investigators, etc.





What  if we Win?
Every dollar donated to the legal fighting fund will be matched dollar for dollar from any judgment we receive to establish a ""Common Decency Trust"" to help other victims of Internet harassment and defamation.




How Will We End the ROR Reign of Terror?
Ed made a strategic error in registering  RipOffReport.com  to the same company that  injures  many good people. We hope to levy ownership of that domain as part of any judgment satisfaction.




What about the Real Scammers?
Ed Magedson has lost all claims to social heroism because he chooses a “we do not remove complaints” policy. Although his site may expose real scammers, the hundreds of thousands of innocent collateral damage defamation victims is not acceptable.





 
But what is Ed's motivation?....  
Evidence suggests that he simply wants to torment me because I’ve exposed his appalling business practices in videos like this one: EXPOSED: RipOffReport.com & Why It Appears Page 1 of Google






FAQs / What Are The Benefits To The Community?






Finally, Ed Magedson Will Face a Jury! No Section §230c Immunity this Time
This lawsuit against Ed Magedson and 
RipOffReport.com is unique because Ed Magedson has personally libeled   
me and my company Common Decency, Inc and others. (This is assuming we raise enough money to file a counterclaim)
Ed Magedson has also allegedly hired, or otherwise engaged a man named
 Darren M Meade who, by his own admission in a deposition last year, is a
 paid Internet reputation-hit-man. Because Darren M Meade has been 
acting as an agent provocateur for Ed Magedson, the latter cannot claim 
to be merely a conduit and thus, is not immune to liability under §230(C) of the
  Communications Decency Act.


 Ed Magedson has engaged 
Darren Meade as his agent and spokesman. Consequently both he and his 
company Xcentric Ventures, LLC are liable for every word printed by 
Darren Meade on RipOffReport.com.
                
                



(3) How Will the Money be Used?  
NOTE: Donations WILL NOT be used
 for director salaries!
As Common Decency, Inc. founder, I have
 independent income and provision (although it has been severely reduced due to the Ripoffreport.com lies).
 All donations/subscription will be 
consolidated into the civil litigation  effort against Ed Magedson and his company 
Xcentric Ventures DBA RipOffReport.com and his co-defendants.

(4) What will Happen to the Money if We Win the Lawsuit?
On the assumption that we prevail and damages are
 recovered from Ed Magedson and/or his company Xcentric Ventures, LLC,  
then every dollar donated to the legal fighting fund will be matched 
dollar for dollar from the proceeds of the damages recovered by way of a
 donation to the soon-to-be established “Common Decency Foundation”.
  This foundation will help fight other battles in the future where 
unscrupulous website operators, like Magedson, take advantage of 
loopholes in the law to conduct what is tantamount to legalized 
extortion.



(5) But How Does this End the Anguish Caused by RipOffReport.com ?
Part of its legal battle will involve a financial colonoscopy
 of Ed Magedson and his company Xcentric Ventures, LLC.. For example, if
 his assets are in his mother’s name or a trust, then we will pursue an 
asset that is worth much more to this planet than hidden money; and that
 is the actual RipOffReport.com domain. As you can see in the following 
link, he made a strategic error in registering that domain to the same 
company that offends and injures so many good people. Ownership of the 
RipOffReport.com domain is our target and our promise to the world is 
that we will pursue that asset with all the gusto we can garner. 
Domain Ownership Record for Ripoffreport.com.
But we 
need your help!  Please join the “Common Decency Army” and help in the 
following ways: 

Financially through donations to this legal fighting fund

By flooding the social networks with news of this battle 
By tweeting, liking and subscribing to our social networking community.

 In order to prevail in taking
 ownership of this domain, we need to be awarded a judgment for 
financial damages in excess of what Ed Magedson can pay. At that point, 
we will be able to file a motion with the court in an attempt to levy the domain 
ownership as part payment of his damages debt. 


My promise to the world is this-- if we prevail in court, and if we are 
successful in levying the domain ownership, the website will be shut down and the 
only thing that will be visible will be an illustration 
depicting Ed Magedson bound and gagged. Furthermore, we promise, if 
possible, to open the log files for every Ripoff Report ever made to 
reveal the identities of the not-so-anonymous authors of the complaints.

These promises are not just 
empty words; as CEO of Common Decency, Inc., I will bind the company, 
and myself as plaintiffs in this case, to the rest of the world with a 
covenant binding us to these conditions. If you give to this cause, when you click “confirm”, you will be 
effectively executing the contract with me so that these promises are 
binding.


(6) But Doesn’t RipOffReport.com Expose Some Real Scammers?
Yes it does, but is the cost of this benefit too high?

 It should be said that there are presumably tens of thousands of genuine scammers who are exposed 
through the RipOffReport.com website. However, the adage  “you can’t 
make an omelette without breaking eggs” does not hold water when the 
cook is Ed Magedson. 
Ed Magedson has lost all claims to social heroism because he chooses a “we do not remove complaints”
 policy, even when unimpeachable evidence is available to vindicate the 
falsely accused victims of his website. Free speech is not free! It 
always costs someone. If it costs a bad guys, then great; but if it hurts the 
innocent then it is bad for people.
NOTE RE MEDIA: Journalists in 
the past have pumped up Ed Magedson's narcissistic supply by embracing 
him as a media darling and social champion, whereas, he is in our eyes an emotional terrorist. The Common Decency Army must educate journalists that their lifting up of Ripoffreport's Ed Magedson as a hero is hurting hundreds of thousands of innocent people.
