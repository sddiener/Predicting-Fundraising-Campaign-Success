<p>Rhizomatica started as a way to bring together resources and promote the application of new and novel telecommunications technologies to real-world problems.

<p><strong>Summary and Background</strong></p>
<p>According to the ITU, 2-3 billion people around the world lack affordable mobile telephone services that facilitate critical communications and access to information. Due to market saturation in developed countries and economic disincentive in the developing world and especially rural areas, mobile coverage proliferation is slowing dramatically worldwide.

<p>Currently, only very large, powerful companies have access to the mobile spectrum and the concessions to provide cellular service.

We want to break this oligopoly and allow communities to become service providers as well.</p>
<p>Thanks to a variety of open-source efforts developed in the last few years, it has become technologically and economically feasible for a community or an individual to provide carrier-grade cellular service to thousands of people. Yet no one has so far applied these technologies in the real-world, much less created the needed regulatory reforms or community-appropriate business models. This project has a parallel component that is seeking to develop the legal/regulatory space and secure access to the necessary frequencies to foment the growth of community, rural and micro-telco's.</p>

upon a time...</b></h3>
<p>
A
man put a blade to his face and called it shaving. Over the decades
shaving has evolved into an an overpriced art form that you can find
in malls, “niche” barbershops, and pyramid schemes. During that
time, in the shadows and the peak season of Movember, the beard
culture has grown (and in some cases completely out of control) into
a formidable beast. What is man supposed to do at this cross road of
destiny? To shave, or not to shave?</p>
<p>
Whatever
the F**k they want. But they better do it well as many people hold
men to face value in this day and age. 
</p>
<p>
My
name is Tenisha Hicks but some people know me as “Demmy”. I live
in Salt Lake City, Utah and am a student of the Skin Science
Institute. Living in this mecca has shown me that the world of the
gentleman is not dead. In fact, it is thriving. But it could easily
be killed off by product that is overpriced, under made with
outlandish chemicals, and falsely advertised. So I took it upon
myself to study what natural remedies and routine enhancement
products are needed to battle the various perils that poor skin,
beard and shaving care befalls mankind living in this climate case of
a state. 
</p><p></p><p>           <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/249794/files/20131208171137-DemToff.png?1386551497"" src="""" style=""width: 472.03319502074686px; height: 240px;""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p>
Finding
logical and appropriate solution, I decided to create
DemToffGuys.com, a natural based skin and beard care company to bring
back the quality instead of the quantity to gentleman grooming
routines. Doing your part to ensure my fundraiser succeeds not only
ensures that you obtain some of this jaw droppingly (it's a word now,
deal with it) good product, but gives you that amazingly warm and
fuzzy feeling of knowing that you are helping to save beardkind and
shaving routines across the nation.</p>
<h3>
<b>Why
I'm Fund-raising</b>
</h3>
<p>
After
opening my online shop three weeks ago I've had several orders from
people and not yet one dissatisfied customer. From friends to
complete strangers, they have all found delightful uses out of what I
have to offer in my care line,. The only unfortunate part of having
all of this wonderful attention and orders is that I'm starting to
doggy paddle and keep up. Dem Toff Guys needs a boost like whoa.
Especially when you have customers saying this: 
</p>
<p>
<i>""Thanks
to the fine products offered by Dem Toff Guys for making me smell
like 1889. Fine, homespun moustache wax and beard oils for the
discerning gentleman."" - C. Fisher</i>
</p>
<p>
“<i>Used
the lemon grass shaving cream this morning and we very impressed.
Went on nicely and smelled amazing. Left my skin feeling very moist
as well as there was no razor burn after, with very little
irritation. Had a very nice light scent with me for a the morning. It
felt almost wrong to not use a safety razor with this.” - R. Bixler</i></p>
<p>
“<i>No
razor
burn with your cream
- and I felt some irritation in the shower when I was washing it out.
It responded and nourished my skin. In fact, that was hours ago and
my skin still feels and smells awesome
“ - B. Spangler </i>
</p>
<h5>
“ <i>OK,
I got my first shipment from 'Dem Toff Guys', and in the nick of
time, too. My Lemongrass shaving cream sample only had one more day
left in it.<br/><br/>First, the package came in a brown paper wrapping,
good old fashioned manly looking thing it was too! Nothing was
broken, Demmy did a great job making sure everything was wrapped in
bubble wrap to protect it.<br/><br/>So far, all i have used is the
beard oil, since its 8 o'clock at night. (I will wait til tomorrow to
use the shaving cream and the aftershave.) I did, however decide to
try the beard oil right away, on my moustache. Since my moustache is
so wild and unmanageable, I really had no idea or expectations as to
how the beard oil would work. But i was pleasantly surprised, on my
first attempt i noticed my scraggly moustache was softer and much
less wirey. As i haven't received my moustache wax yet, i do not yet
know how the two will work together, but just having the beard oil
itself on my moustache has made a big difference. Also, I really love
the scent, 'Carribean Sailor'. I mostly stayed away from the
aftershave scents in the stores, always smelled too perfumey, or just
didn't like them. But, THIS stuff is much different. Perhaps more
muskey? but NOT like a perfume, and definitely a MAN's scent. (I got
shaving cream and after shave in the same scent) <br/><br/>Very
happy with the new products, Demmy. You have managed to get me
interested in grooming myself again, Thanks! I will report back about
the others after I have used them.<br/><br/>Cheers!” - M. Mannonen </i>
</h5>
<p>
Shopping
local as much as possible, all funding obtained from this project is
to assist with expanding the business. I plan to produce wholesale
order opportunities, obtain marketing materials, an advertisement
budget, local fair and festival vending fees to be paid, promotional
packets and materials, product to make my products faster, better,
stronger and if a stretch goal of unthinkable measure is reached,
open up a Gentlemans Parlor where I can not only sell my merchandise,
but provide work opportunities for classically trained barbers, have
an in house tailor for suit adjustment, and coffee lounge.</p>
<p>
What
makes my dreams and business so unique compared to the other shops? I
am a woman who knows what she likes and grew up with barbers in the
family who have been mentoring me about mens skin care, angst, and
pains of being a modern day gentleman in such a way that I'm
determined to bring my “holy grail” of care to the front lines.
If I don't reach my entire goal, the funds still go towards making
this possible, hard work WILL do the rest.  
</p>

In this day
and age with 1000000 other super cool fundraiser programs going and
your wallet being kicked back and forth by unexpected
kicks-in-the-nuts, sharing my project is just as good as donating!
Ladies, you're also welcomed to participate! I know how often we
scream about how there's no “Gentlemen” out there, well now's
your chance to help keep their grooming tactics alive, and maybe even
obtain a gift for the one you've been thinking of, or that is in your
life now. It's like rubbing Buddah's belly for luck...except, you're
wishing this project luck by sharing and or contributing. 
</p><br/><p></p></div>","Once
upon a time...

A
man put a blade to his face and called it shaving. Over the decades
shaving has evolved into an an overpriced art form that you can find
in malls, “niche” barbershops, and pyramid schemes. During that
time, in the shadows and the peak season of Movember, the beard
culture has grown (and in some cases completely out of control) into
a formidable beast. What is man supposed to do at this cross road of
destiny? To shave, or not to shave?

Whatever
the F**k they want. But they better do it well as many people hold
men to face value in this day and age. 


My
name is Tenisha Hicks but some people know me as “Demmy”. I live
in Salt Lake City, Utah and am a student of the Skin Science
Institute. Living in this mecca has shown me that the world of the
gentleman is not dead. In fact, it is thriving. But it could easily
be killed off by product that is overpriced, under made with
outlandish chemicals, and falsely advertised. So I took it upon
myself to study what natural remedies and routine enhancement
products are needed to battle the various perils that poor skin,
beard and shaving care befalls mankind living in this climate case of
a state. 
           

Finding
logical and appropriate solution, I decided to create
DemToffGuys.com, a natural based skin and beard care company to bring
back the quality instead of the quantity to gentleman grooming
routines. Doing your part to ensure my fundraiser succeeds not only
ensures that you obtain some of this jaw droppingly (it's a word now,
deal with it) good product, but gives you that amazingly warm and
fuzzy feeling of knowing that you are helping to save beardkind and
shaving routines across the nation.

Why
I'm Fund-raising


After
opening my online shop three weeks ago I've had several orders from
people and not yet one dissatisfied customer. From friends to
complete strangers, they have all found delightful uses out of what I
have to offer in my care line,. The only unfortunate part of having
all of this wonderful attention and orders is that I'm starting to
doggy paddle and keep up. Dem Toff Guys needs a boost like whoa.
Especially when you have customers saying this: 


""Thanks
to the fine products offered by Dem Toff Guys for making me smell
like 1889. Fine, homespun moustache wax and beard oils for the
discerning gentleman."" - C. Fisher


“Used
the lemon grass shaving cream this morning and we very impressed.
Went on nicely and smelled amazing. Left my skin feeling very moist
as well as there was no razor burn after, with very little
irritation. Had a very nice light scent with me for a the morning. It
felt almost wrong to not use a safety razor with this.” - R. Bixler

“No
razor
burn with your cream
- and I felt some irritation in the shower when I was washing it out.
It responded and nourished my skin. In fact, that was hours ago and
my skin still feels and smells awesome
“ - B. Spangler 


“ OK,
I got my first shipment from 'Dem Toff Guys', and in the nick of
time, too. My Lemongrass shaving cream sample only had one more day
left in it.First, the package came in a brown paper wrapping,
good old fashioned manly looking thing it was too! Nothing was
broken, Demmy did a great job making sure everything was wrapped in
bubble wrap to protect it.So far, all i have used is the
beard oil, since its 8 o'clock at night. (I will wait til tomorrow to
use the shaving cream and the aftershave.) I did, however decide to
try the beard oil right away, on my moustache. Since my moustache is
so wild and unmanageable, I really had no idea or expectations as to
how the beard oil would work. But i was pleasantly surprised, on my
first attempt i noticed my scraggly moustache was softer and much
less wirey. As i haven't received my moustache wax yet, i do not yet
know how the two will work together, but just having the beard oil
itself on my moustache has made a big difference. Also, I really love
the scent, 'Carribean Sailor'. I mostly stayed away from the
aftershave scents in the stores, always smelled too perfumey, or just
didn't like them. But, THIS stuff is much different. Perhaps more
muskey? but NOT like a perfume, and definitely a MAN's scent. (I got
shaving cream and after shave in the same scent) Very
happy with the new products, Demmy. You have managed to get me
interested in grooming myself again, Thanks! I will report back about
the others after I have used them.Cheers!” - M. Mannonen 


Shopping
local as much as possible, all funding obtained from this project is
to assist with expanding the business. I plan to produce wholesale
order opportunities, obtain marketing materials, an advertisement
budget, local fair and festival vending fees to be paid, promotional
packets and materials, product to make my products faster, better,
stronger and if a stretch goal of unthinkable measure is reached,
open up a Gentlemans Parlor where I can not only sell my merchandise,
but provide work opportunities for classically trained barbers, have
an in house tailor for suit adjustment, and coffee lounge.

What
makes my dreams and business so unique compared to the other shops? I
am a woman who knows what she likes and grew up with barbers in the
family who have been mentoring me about mens skin care, angst, and
pains of being a modern day gentleman in such a way that I'm
determined to bring my “holy grail” of care to the front lines.
If I don't reach my entire goal, the funds still go towards making
this possible, hard work WILL do the rest.

Our involvement will taper, though we will always be available for consultation.<br/></p><p>Last but not least - why EarthBags, and why the two-story building? EarthBag walls are water, fire, and bullet proof, and have superior thermal and sound insulation performance. The use of soil as a construction material is the only option for low-income people, and most buildings use either kiln-dried or sun-dried brick. The former requires cutting and burning of trees in a country that is facing deforestation, and the latter produces sub-standard homes prone to erosion. EarthBags avoid both pitfalls, and use a waste material that is by-product of oil refining processes. The walls can be erected quickly and require mostly unskilled labor, saving the cost of hiring contractors, and allows the introduction of new skills to villagers with little formal background in construction. And when finished, an EarthBag house can look like any other house, ensuring that it is accepted by the local community. The novelty of the bags brought people together around the excitement of trying something new. </p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span><h3></h3><p><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;""></span></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/472122/files/20140330182018-EB_VC_BRICK.jpg?1396228818"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></h4><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Brick vs. EarthBag Walls</b></p><p><br/></p><p>The two-story house is a way to address the difficulties we have witnessed
 regarding land tenure. In this small and dense country it is hard to find suitable building sites. We are starting small, by limiting the two-story 
portion of this summer's house to the utility structure. A small 
building is a good way to introduce the idea to the workers, and it will
 allow us to test the incorporation of lateral bracing in the walls, 
floors, and roof, testing costs and constructability in an efficient 
manner. We want to limit the amount of bracing (therefore keeping the cost down) needed to build a 
structure that manages its own loads, active loads (people), and seismic and lateral loads without requiring an 
expensive concrete frame. This way we can make a great leap towards 
addressing Association Icyerekezo's housing needs and advancing 
EarthBag construction techniques along the way. </p><p></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/442036/files/20140318074920-the_team.jpg?1395154160"" src="""" style=""""/></p></span></h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>The Masoro builders</b></span></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><b><br/></b></span></p><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>The Lowdown</b><br/></span></h3><ul>

We research and design with new and old building technologies to find the right balance of practical, cultural, and community needs to best serve our local partners. We design the process of building as much as the building itself.Proposed 2-story prototype buildingIn Rwanda, we are working with a new builder's association to develop the potential of EarthBag construction as a way of enabling them to build their own homes.

Our new goal is to build a 2-story building with the same group of builders in 2014.Africa, Rwanda, Masoro - a village 20km north of Rwanda's capital city of KigaliWe used a type of EarthBag innovated by Eternally Solar in South Africa, and planned the construction of the house as a large-scale training workshop. It was led by Riaan Hough, an EarthBag construction expert, GAC and local architecture students. Using
 labor-intensive, low-skilled construction techniques allowed us to tap 
local knowledge and expertise and ensure that the building would be accepted by the local 
community. We want to refine and develop this collaborative 
building strategy, and eventually build 50 houses in Masoro.The first EarthBag house in Masoro under constructionThe design of the house was based on a standard government model that 
uses a breezeway to 
separate the living and bedroom spaces from the utility volume. We 
modified 
the design to incorporate shaded outdoor space,
 providing privacy while allowing sun and air to filter through. The

will be used as a meeting space and for storage. While the overwhelming mass of the house

glass, roof rafters, purlins and roofing must be brought from Kigali, about a 30 minute drive through steep hills. The ability to transfer materials in bulk, 
and store them until they are to be used, will afford huge savings over 
time. Also, 2-story, multi-family houses are 
critical to Rwanda's future, as it is one of Africa’s densest countries and housing shortages are chronic. So 
this summer we want to combine two aspirations in one building by taking
 the project to the next level - UP!For press coverage of our first Masoro house, please click on the below links:ArchDaily, Domus, Phaidon Atlas, Archinect, Deborah Norden FundAnd this is us. You can find out more about us at our website.GAC: Jamie Setzler, Yutaka Sho, Zaneta Hong and Michael Beaman. Our Rwandan student partners are Patrice Ndababonye, Doreen Ingabire, Rene Isabane and Theo Uwayezu.How it worksOur model is to enable self-building traditions common in Africa, and develop local community organizations that want to learn to build and to meet their own needs. GAC's direct involvement is limited to the first several houses, and is focused as much on developing capacity and resilience as it is on construction and technical knowledge. We want to go from a scenario like this:to one that looks like this:Over time, the local community assumes control of the building process, managing all the costs, labor and legal issues associated with the building process. Our involvement will taper, though we will always be available for consultation.Last but not least - why EarthBags, and why the two-story building? EarthBag walls are water, fire, and bullet proof, and have superior thermal and sound insulation performance. The use of soil as a construction material is the only option for low-income people, and most buildings use either kiln-dried or sun-dried brick. The former requires cutting and burning of trees in a country that is facing deforestation, and the latter produces sub-standard homes prone to erosion. EarthBags avoid both pitfalls, and use a waste material that is by-product of oil refining processes. The walls can be erected quickly and require mostly unskilled labor, saving the cost of hiring contractors, and allows the introduction of new skills to villagers with little formal background in construction. And when finished, an EarthBag house can look like any other house, ensuring that it is accepted by the local community. The novelty of the bags brought people together around the excitement of trying something new. Brick vs. EarthBag WallsThe two-story house is a way to address the difficulties we have witnessed
 regarding land tenure. In this small and dense country it is hard to find suitable building sites. We are starting small, by limiting the two-story 
portion of this summer's house to the utility structure. A small 
building is a good way to introduce the idea to the workers, and it will
 allow us to test the incorporation of lateral bracing in the walls, 
floors, and roof, testing costs and constructability in an efficient 
manner. We want to limit the amount of bracing (therefore keeping the cost down) needed to build a 
structure that manages its own loads, active loads (people), and seismic and lateral loads without requiring an 
expensive concrete frame. This way we can make a great leap towards 
addressing Association Icyerekezo's housing needs and advancing 
EarthBag construction techniques along the way. The Masoro buildersThe Lowdown
We have raised $18,000 thus far through generous donors and foundations.
We need $20,000 more for material testing, equipment rental during the building process (a truck and scaffolding), wages for 50 workers and 4 student interns for 4 months ($2.00/day/person), bringing water to the site, and flights and lodging for one GAC member. Please contact us for a detailed breakdown of material and labor costs. 
The association has completed a draft of the bylaws that will govern their conduct, and is working to formalize their standing as a legal entity.

The ultimate goal is to build 50 homes in Masoro, developing the capacity of Association Icyerekezo until they are building homes for themselves independently of our involvement.
The mayor of the district has signed a Memorandum of Understanding to provide infrastructure for the new village.
Dr. Eric Lui, an associate professor of civil engineering at Syracuse University, is coordinating the necessary material testing
Dr. Johnny Anderton, who invented the improved EarthBag technique, and Riaan Hough, an EarthBag construction expert from EarthKaya, continue to work with us to ensure the success of the project.

OUR FABULOUS GIFTS14 artists, a print shop and GAC have been working together to create a series of fabric patterns inspired by African designs to raise funds for the Masoro project. Here are some samples when they are repeated and printed on fabric:
StitchWorks was initiated by Jungil Hong and Yutaka Sho. The Headlight Hotel Print Shop and Tiny Showcase in Providence, RI, have been donating a percentage of the money from each print sold to a cause chosen by the artist. For StitchWorks, they printed fabric patterns on paper for sale and up to 80% of the proceeds will be used to purchase building materials for the housing construction in Masoro. We would like to share with you these fabulous fabric designs in various forms and for all levels of donations, on postcards, in pamphlets, on paper and fabric.

Moreover , some of the best house special juices such as freshly made Tamarind juice with palm sugar, avocado juice, fresh yogurt drink as well as a variety of unique Burmese Desserts andGelato Icecream will be available to help finishing your meal. Ruby Burma will be opened for lunch, friendly dinners, and possibility of serving Burmese breakfast in the future.
 
The Burmese Flavour Card Campaign
 
We're opening Ruby Burma on a small budget, purchasing an existing restaurant ourselves with our own savings. We're launching this pre-sales campaign to help complete our vision of what Ruby Burma should be and to generate momentum in the lead up to our grand opening.
With your support, we're aiming to raise $10,000 through pre-sales of Ruby Burma meal plan Cards. This money will go a long way in helping to complete the details that will make Ruby Burma special, welcoming everything from outfitting our late-night curry warts window, to getting the right promotion and marketing.
When you buy a Ruby Burma meal plan for a given value, you will get a card pre-loaded with that amount to spend at Ruby Burma. As our thanks to you for buying a Try Burmese flavour before we open, we're offering special perks that range from I love Tea Leaf salad, to having the whole restaurant for your own private party.
 
Thank You!
 
Ruby Burma will be a special neighborhood spot, a meeting place for good folks to eat tea leaf salad with Burmese tea without breaking your wallet. We thank you for your support, whether it's buying a Try Burmese flavour card or sharing this video with your friends.
We look forward to serving you Burmese Cuisine in the early spring of 2013!
 
Address of Ruby Burma Restaurant
3685 Blvd St. Laurent
Montreal, QC H2X 1A1
 
What we need 
 
Your support will go towards mainly pre opening promotion, marketing and a commercial dish washer, fixtures and decoration. For that we need at least $10,000.

<h3>James, Kylei, Abby, and Adi need your help.</h3>
<p>   We're all queer and poly, and vary from each other in other non-normative ways.  Daily life is a difficult maze, as we try to build our communities, develop close connections, and make ripples of change in a world that doesn't offer us the same resources that it offers more normative people.  Transcending Boundaries Conference ( <a href=""http://www.transcendingboundaries.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.transcendingboundaries.org/</a> ) is one place we can go where we can learn, grow, and connect with people who have similar experiences and goals.</p>
<p>  This campaign is to help us get to TBC -- we're poor and have work, school, and other time committments which mean we will need to fly to Massachusetts instead of taking a more economical (and slow) route.</p>
<p>our intentions for the conference are to:<br/>James: build connections with other queer and trans folk to make a strong net of social justice activists. <br/>Adi: talk to people, learn new ways to handle the injustices of the world and new ways to help right things.<br/>Abby: learn from people who have taken the steps in their lives that I want to move towards and grown in ways that help them know how to interact in a sometimes difficult world in a kind and loving way.<br/>Kylei: build connections with people I feel safe being out to, and integrate with activists and learn to converse about social justice with people that don't understand.</p>
</div>
<h3><strong>what we need &amp; what you get</strong></h3>
<div>
<p>We need to buy conference tickets, flights, hotel rooms, and food: if we are careful and thrifty, we can each go to the conference for $500.  That's a total of $2,000 -- the extra $180 we're asking for is to cover indiegogo's fees.  If we don't meet our goal, the amount we do get will be shared among us and we'll try to raise the rest some other way.  If one of us end up not able to go or if we raise more than what we asked for, the remainder will go to TBC (transcendingboundaries.org) and N/A* (clubs.kennesaw.edu/nonnorm/about-the-group/).</p>
<p><strong>note: If you possibly can, please donate directly with your card instead of by paypal -- they take a chunk in fees.</strong></p>
<p>We're all pitching in to bring you awesome perks!  You'll be able to get custom beaded jewelry, sculpted jewelry for gauged ears, vegan treats (if you live nearby), art tins, handmade buttons, a song written for you, or even a photoshoot!</p>

<h3>what your donation will do:</h3>
</div>
<div>When you donate to this project, you're investing not only in the four of us, but in our impact on the world.  We will return stronger, wiser, and more equipped to handle the daily rejection that the mainstream world presses on us. Here is a more in-depth explanation of what TBC means to us:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>James:<br/>I hope to learn more about myself as a queer, polyamorous, trans, genderfree, pagan, social justice activist and make new connections that will help me grow. I went to TBC last year and realized for the first time in my life that I am not alone -- my community is just harder to find.  Being there felt like I had finally found the family I'd been looking for all my life.  Going to TBC again this year I have offered to lead workshops and I hope to give as much as I get.  I'm a member of N/A*, an organization dedicated to bringing resources, representation, safety, and community to non-normative people; TBC will help me learn how to better connect with change-makers.<br/><br/>Adi:<br/>I have very few people in my life that I can speak to about human rights issues, even fewer that I can speak to about trans issues specifically. I enjoy speaking to them, most of the people I feel like I gain something from in the same way that you gain knowledge from teaching. A few of the people I feel like I am learning from because they have a different set of oppression and privileges than I do. I think it's important to gain knowledge of those different perspectives. But even fewer, maybe three people in my life, do I feel teach me because our of their much higher level of education on those subjects. I desire all levels of learning, and the fact that there is such a lack of this sort of learning in my life feels wrong. TBC would be important for my life because it could offer that. Not to mention a feeling of belonging that I rarely experience.</div>
<div>
<br/>Abby:</div>
<div>I've struggled to find words to things I know to be problematic, struggled to make the spaces around me feel inclusive to the diversity of our community when I know it has the potential to be. I feel like a sponge walking into the activism world and I just want to learn more. You can help us start important conversations that lead to action and change in our communities, you can help us so we are better able to create the space and words that are so needed for awesome queers like us.</div>
<div>
<br/>Kylei:
<div class=""msg Nth"">I went to TBC last year and felt... Home. I still had anxieties, but for once I felt like I could talk about them to people around. It was wonderful and amazing, and I made some (brief) connections there that made me feel like community was brewing. I want to strengthen those bonds. I also feel like I learned more from TBC about successful, non-self-damaging, activism than anywhere else. I want to learn more about activism, and learn better ways of doing it. I feel like I'm very close to the point of being able to explain to non-questioning-oppression-people when something upsets me. For example, a friend of mine uses the word retarded when someone makes a mistake at work, and I feel really upset every time I hear it. I told this person that I have a cousin that is mentally challenged, and they use it less around me, but... I'd really like to be able to explain why it's better to avoid the word completely.  Also, I feel like there is a wall between me and my next step of understanding social justice issues, and while I don't think that TBC would remove the wall, it would probably give me the tools to remove it myself.</div>

</div></div>","James, Kylei, Abby, and Adi need your help.
   We're all queer and poly, and vary from each other in other non-normative ways.  Daily life is a difficult maze, as we try to build our communities, develop close connections, and make ripples of change in a world that doesn't offer us the same resources that it offers more normative people.  Transcending Boundaries Conference ( http://www.transcendingboundaries.org/ ) is one place we can go where we can learn, grow, and connect with people who have similar experiences and goals.
  This campaign is to help us get to TBC -- we're poor and have work, school, and other time committments which mean we will need to fly to Massachusetts instead of taking a more economical (and slow) route.
our intentions for the conference are to:James: build connections with other queer and trans folk to make a strong net of social justice activists. Adi: talk to people, learn new ways to handle the injustices of the world and new ways to help right things.Abby: learn from people who have taken the steps in their lives that I want to move towards and grown in ways that help them know how to interact in a sometimes difficult world in a kind and loving way.Kylei: build connections with people I feel safe being out to, and integrate with activists and learn to converse about social justice with people that don't understand.

what we need & what you get

We need to buy conference tickets, flights, hotel rooms, and food: if we are careful and thrifty, we can each go to the conference for $500.  That's a total of $2,000 -- the extra $180 we're asking for is to cover indiegogo's fees.  If we don't meet our goal, the amount we do get will be shared among us and we'll try to raise the rest some other way.  If one of us end up not able to go or if we raise more than what we asked for, the remainder will go to TBC (transcendingboundaries.org) and N/A* (clubs.kennesaw.edu/nonnorm/about-the-group/).
note: If you possibly can, please donate directly with your card instead of by paypal -- they take a chunk in fees.
We're all pitching in to bring you awesome perks!  You'll be able to get custom beaded jewelry, sculpted jewelry for gauged ears, vegan treats (if you live nearby), art tins, handmade buttons, a song written for you, or even a photoshoot!

</h3><p>For the past 7 years the <a href=""http://nebeginningfarmers.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Northeast Beginning Farmer Project</a> has helped thousands of new and aspiring farmers get

need to develop strong farm businesses. </p><p>Hearing advice from real farmers--and seeing how things are 
produced on the farm--is priceless both for these new farmers and for 
any eater interested in how food is produced. So we began producing videos 
in 2008, starting with a series called ""Voices of Experience,"" which 
provides farm business advice from successful small farmers, and ""Video 
Mentors,"" which shows behind-the-scenes production techniques for 
vegetables, fruits, poultry, pigs, and more. We've made these clips 
freely available on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/cornellsmallfarms"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">our YouTube channel</a><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/cornellsmallfarms"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>. We've received comments from new farmers all over the world about how helpful these clips have been. </p><p>With the funds from this campaign, <b>we will use footage we've 
already captured to edit and produce 15-20 new video clips, on topics</b> <b>
including all aspects of tree fruit farming, farming with draft animals,
 building and growing in an unheated hoophouse, and more.</b> Just like our previous videos, these will be 
high-quality, detailed clips that will help new and existing farmers 
learn first-hand from successful farmers. <br/></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>We're asking for 
$15,000, and every penny of that will go to pay our phenomenal

flexible funding, because if we don't meet our target, we'll just 
produce fewer clips. If we exceed our goal, we'll produce more clips 
than we've promised. </p>
<p>To express our gratitude, we're offering funders a great range of 
gifts, including farm scene thank-you cards, hard copy ""sneak previews"" of
 each video before it's publicly released, and printed copies of our 
popular <a href=""http://nebeginningfarmers.org/publications"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Small Farms Program publications</a>. For our highest

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Melissa. For the past 6 years, I've been in the Video Game Industry, but, I haven't been that lucky. All my work has been contract work. I've been out of work since June of 2012, and it's time for me to get out of the very fluid industry that I love. I have the job, and the place to live lined up. What I don't have, is the money to get me there. I just need a little help. A little help from a lot of people will get me where I need to go to get set up, and get things in order.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need around $1000 to get me, my things, and my two adorable cats to Iowa. </p>
<ul>
<li>Estimated cost of the U-haul: $604</li>
<li>Estimated Gas: $300</li>
</ul>
<p>The rest of the money will go to additional gas, and getting my boss/friend down to where I am to drive the truck for me.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This isn't some earth shattering thing. Not some way to change the world. But it's a way to help someone who just hasn't had the best of luck in life get things turned around. And the cats. They'll have a good home, where they can be well cared for. Don't forget the kitties, my little fur-children.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't afford to help, please, spread the word of my campaign to your friends. Maybe they can help.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading this, and if you donated, thank you again.</p>

<h3>Happy Birthday!!</h3>
<p>Over the past year, we have grown to over 100,000 activists who have walked, run and biked enough miles to go from earth to the moon...and back...three times!</p>
<ul>
<li>You've earned $354,570.47 for charity! Among other things, you have:</li>
<li>Funded over $127,000 of Autism, Cancer and Parkinson's research</li>
<li>Earned over $50,000 for wounded veterans</li>
<li>Earned over $50,000 to protect animals and nature</li>
<li>Educated 554 girls for a year</li>
<li>Provided 23,584 doses of antiretroviral pills to people living with HIV</li>
<li>Fed 407,540 people</li>
</ul>
<p>And we're only just beginning. At the rate we are growing, we have the potential to move millions of <em>corporate</em> dollars to charity every year — money that companies would otherwise spend on digital advertising like banner ads and spam email campaigns.</p>
<p>But moving this market requires scale. So, to get this scale, we personally funded most of this past year's sponsorship pool ourselves. And this has enabled us to grow large enough to secure great sponsorships from companies like Lifeway and Promax Nutrition.  </p>
<p>However, we're not entirely sustainable yet. Which is why we're hoping you'll invest in the Charity Miles sponsorship fund so that we can continue adding great people like you to our team.</p>
<p>This will enable us to attract more sponsors, so that we can all have an even bigger impact than anyone of us could have alone.</p>
<p>It will also enable us to attract other investors so that we can continue to improve upon the app and build the features that many of you have been requesting. (For example, so that the app can work indoors, on treadmills and spin bikes.)</p>
<p>So, if you've enjoyed using the app this year; if you've been inspired to run just a bit farther; if you've been touched by one of our emails; if you're proud to be a part of this team that is changing the world, please help us take Charity Miles to the next level. #EveryMileMatters!</p>

<h3>About Charity Miles</h3>
<p>Charity Miles is a free iPhone/Android app that enables people to earn money for charity when they walk, run or bike. Bikers earn 10¢ per mile; walkers and runners earn 25¢ per mile — all courtesy of Charity Miles and our corporate partners.</p>
<p>We launched the app one year ago and have since won wide spread acclaim. Charity Miles has been featured as a favorite app in almost every major fitness magazine, national news programs and morning shows like <em>Live! With Kelly &amp; Michael</em> and <em>The Today Show.</em></p>
<p>Mashable named Charity Miles as one of its five favorite fitness apps for 2013. We won two Ignite Good Millennial Impact Grants from The Huffington Post and Heartfelt Foundations. And we won both the SXSW Dewey Winburne Award for Social Good, and the SXSW People's Choice Award, two of the top awards at the world's most prominent interactive festival.</p>
<p>But most importantly, we are a team of over 100,000 activists who have walked, run and biked more than 1.4 million miles to earn $350,000 for charity. And we're only just beginning! #EveryMileMatters!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Soul Threads began as a project by friends on the track team and IB programme at Mountain View high school. Currently, Ben Sorensen, Alexander Burlingame, and Emmy Reinwald opperate the bulk of the work because we all have the same desire: to spread our love and affection for those afflicted with cancer. In order to do this, Soul Threads donates hand-knitted beanies to chemotherapy patients in local hospitals. We all know someone or have personally experienced the hardship of this disease, so it is vitally important to us that we can reach as many people as possible. </p>
<p>If you help us by donating any amount of funds, we can continue this project. The cost of yarn, looms, and other materials is causing us to lose money fast. But we want to continue Soul Threads, and even continue it further. Your dollar could help us impact more hospitals, even homeless shelters, and ultimately more lives. Let us show the power of community in making a difference right here, right now.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>One of our primary goals right now is to raise funds in order to subsidize the costs of materials. Each beanie we make can cost up to $10.00, so we are constantly looking for ways to supply the monetary fees to make this work.</p>
<p>We are asking for you to donate any amount of money you feel compelled to, knowing fully that we make zero profit from what you give. All proceeds are put directly back into the project so we can reach more cancer patients. However, we also sell hats. For every hat you buy:</p>
<p>• A hat will be donated to a local chemotherapy patient</p>
<p>• Any and all profit will be used to invest in more yarn for future donations</p>
<p>• Another personal will receive hope from your altruism.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If we come together and make this work, the impact could be profound. Consider the implications of every dollar you donate. Your money is not going to be lost in the networks of a superorganization. We are simply a group of students with bigger dreams than ourselves. Any money we get will fuel Soul Threads, so that eventually every oncology unit, every homeless shelter, and every person in need in Stafford County would receive a hand-crafted beanie. We believe this can happen, and we hope you do too.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Other Ways You Can Help</span></strong></p>

<p>We realize not everyone has the capability to help us out economically, and that's okay. Simply spreading the word, telling your friends, posting a link on your Facebook, whatever it may be, would help us immensely. In addition, we also accept yarn donations, so if you have any spare/scrap yarn from your last scarf, send it our way! Remember, Soul Threads is not about us; it is about the people we can benefit with your help.</p>

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p class=""Default"">Our mental health agency has served individuals in our community for 8 years. We provide therapy for children and adults of all ages and backgrounds. A considerable portion of our work is focused on working with children in the foster care system, children who have been abused, and those with developmental disabilities. We provide psychiatric medication management, parenting classes, social groups, and psychological evaluations. We employ more than 25 people, including a Psychiatrist, Psychologists, Counselors, Social Workers, a LMFT, support staff, and even a local high school intern. We are a group of highly skilled, dedicated clinicians who remain committed to serving individuals of all backgrounds and needs, including the Medicaid population ignored by many others. We are requesting your help to continue doing so.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As you have probably heard, there has been enormous scrutiny of the NC Medicaid program and mental health services over the past few years.  In a recent effort to revise and improve the system, a process was put into place that has disproportionately and adversely affected licensed independent providers such as at our Agency, and our ability to offer Medicaid services in the future</p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""Default"">One such process involves the State requiring providers to submit all of their paperwork to a contracting agency called CCME that will then review and possibly approve payment to be made months after the client has been seen.   There is no surprise that CCME has many flaws, inaccuracies, and inefficiencies in their system for monitoring providers. Even worse, they have a financial advantage to rejecting the claims – they get to extend their contracts for saving money.   A CCME representative told us directly that they would be ""working themselves out of a job"" as they moved people off of prepayment reviews. A CCME representative told us directly that there are ""tricks"" that could ensure that we were taken off of prepayment.<strong><em>We have not tried any tricks as we naively believed that the system would work out!</em></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Believe it or not, providers can not appeal this process.  Within the past few weeks, numerous small, large, and long term providers in the area have already either gone out of business completely or stopped taking Medicaid.  You will likely be hearing more and more about providers who have either gone out of business or who are no longer going to provide such Medicaid services. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>These are a few links that may be helpful for you to put the story into context and to understand that laws have been broken by the DMA/DHHS (the Agency that runs Medicaid), not the providers.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.wral.com/audit-mismanagement-costs-nc-medicaid-system-millions/12048026/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.wral.com/audit-mismanagement-costs-nc-medicaid-system-millions/12048026/</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.wral.com/nc-auditor-dhhs-improperly-paid-580k-in-overtime/12108305/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.wral.com/nc-auditor-dhhs-improperly-paid-580k-in-overtime/12108305/</a></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.wral.com/providers-getting-squeezed-out-by-medicaid-rules/12085183/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.wral.com/providers-getting-squeezed-out-by-medicaid-rules/12085183/</a> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The answer to these political problems should not be to cut Medicaid or to limit the number of providers.  If we do, there will be individuals in our schools, workplaces, and communities without needed mental health services.  They will likely face higher frequencies of academic, legal, and negative societal outcomes. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have filed several legal motions due to this being an unconstitutional action and the DMA/DHHS/the State not following policies and procedures to support providers and families needing these services.   Our Attorney, Knicole Allen Emmanuel has worked in the State Attorney General’s Office in the past and is now fighting on behalf of providers and small business. <strong>We need your help to raise $25,000 in legal funds to fight this process.</strong>   The outcome of this fight may help establish a precedent that could benefit others.   Any amount raised over this amount will be used to cover services for the many families who have already lost their therapy.  No amount is too small and we do appreciate your support. </p>

<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you can not make a contribution, we understand.  But please share our campaign with others and spread the word about how these types of actions can and will impact the children and families in our schools, neighborhoods, and communities. </p>

As you have probably heard, there has been enormous scrutiny of the NC Medicaid program and mental health services over the past few years.  In a recent effort to revise and improve the system, a process was put into place that has disproportionately and adversely affected licensed independent providers such as at our Agency, and our ability to offer Medicaid services in the future
 
One such process involves the State requiring providers to submit all of their paperwork to a contracting agency called CCME that will then review and possibly approve payment to be made months after the client has been seen.   There is no surprise that CCME has many flaws, inaccuracies, and inefficiencies in their system for monitoring providers. Even worse, they have a financial advantage to rejecting the claims – they get to extend their contracts for saving money.   A CCME representative told us directly that they would be ""working themselves out of a job"" as they moved people off of prepayment reviews. A CCME representative told us directly that there are ""tricks"" that could ensure that we were taken off of prepayment.We have not tried any tricks as we naively believed that the system would work out!
 
Believe it or not, providers can not appeal this process.  Within the past few weeks, numerous small, large, and long term providers in the area have already either gone out of business completely or stopped taking Medicaid.  You will likely be hearing more and more about providers who have either gone out of business or who are no longer going to provide such Medicaid services. 
 
These are a few links that may be helpful for you to put the story into context and to understand that laws have been broken by the DMA/DHHS (the Agency that runs Medicaid), not the providers.

http://www.wral.com/providers-getting-squeezed-out-by-medicaid-rules/12085183/ 
 
The answer to these political problems should not be to cut Medicaid or to limit the number of providers.  If we do, there will be individuals in our schools, workplaces, and communities without needed mental health services.  They will likely face higher frequencies of academic, legal, and negative societal outcomes. 
 
I have filed several legal motions due to this being an unconstitutional action and the DMA/DHHS/the State not following policies and procedures to support providers and families needing these services.   Our Attorney, Knicole Allen Emmanuel has worked in the State Attorney General’s Office in the past and is now fighting on behalf of providers and small business. We need your help to raise $25,000 in legal funds to fight this process.   The outcome of this fight may help establish a precedent that could benefit others.   Any amount raised over this amount will be used to cover services for the many families who have already lost their therapy.  No amount is too small and we do appreciate your support. 
 
Other Ways You Can Help
If you can not make a contribution, we understand.  But please share our campaign with others and spread the word about how these types of actions can and will impact the children and families in our schools, neighborhoods, and communities.

We now want to encourage others to share with us our love of this country.</p>
<p>In 2015 we stumbled across a spectacular plot of land close to the Caribbean coast, next to the Buritaca river. </p>
<p>If successful, we will be one step closer to realising our dream of sharing a slice of paradise with you all. We wish to create a safe and environmentally sustainable place in this beautiful part of Colombia.

</div></div>","Short Summary We are Ben & Guy, two friends from England with a passion for travel and the hospitality industry. We met 9 years ago at The University of Exeter and, having first travelled through this amazing country as only passing tourists, we fell in love with the place and returned to live and work here. We now want to encourage others to share with us our love of this country.
In 2015 we stumbled across a spectacular plot of land close to the Caribbean coast, next to the Buritaca river. 
If successful, we will be one step closer to realising our dream of sharing a slice of paradise with you all. We wish to create a safe and environmentally sustainable place in this beautiful part of Colombia. We believe we can begin to make the most of this pristine area for the benefit of local people and its visitors alike, without destroying its beauty.

<p>Hi! My name is Nick Laurence Kirchmar. I am a former theatre geek. I was an actor and then toured with several Broadway shows as the merchandising manager, You know? the T-Shirt dudes in the lobby? Anyway, I have always had a background in either theatre, marketing or retail.</p>
<p>In 2007 while attenting the University of Wisconsin to get a degree in Stage Management, I was diagnosed with bladder cancer. I was devasted but, I was not going to let this get me down, I remained in school and attended my classes as well as did volunteer work with my Fraternity, Tau Kappa Epsilon. </p>
<p>I went through BCG treatment (Essentially BOVINE TB) and because of that, many things bothered my skin, so I began making organic soap as well as soy candles and skin care products to keep my skin soft and not dry and cracked. by 2010 I had a nice little company going but then the cancer came back. </p>
<p>Because of the bladder cancer's return, I was no longer able to make soap and adhere to the soap making process as I constantly had to use the restroom. After another 3 months of BCG, I was told the cancer had metastasized and I had inoperable liver cancer and basically a year to live. I went thru 7 cycles of chemotherapy from Nov of 2011 to May of 2012 consiting of a 9 hour day, a 6 hour day 8 days later and a very painful shot, then a 14 day break.</p>
<p>In April I was told they could not see any tumors or lesions on my liver and my lymph system was no longer swollen. I have basically beaten cancer and I owe it to changing what I eat and put in my body. (only organic and all natural) A positive attitude, amazing friends around the world on Facebook, and using natural products. I was given a second chance and so far have been cancer free for 4 months. I did this all on my own, as my family did not think I was worth a phone call or even a get well card. Maybe because they don't approve of my lifestyle. </p>
<p>I love making and creating Organic soaps and skin care products. They are allergen free and I use only the purest and most natural ingriedents and essential oils. The new skin care line I am creating will be amazing and will be called Joseph Nicolas. I am creating recipes that will be friendly for cancer patients and those with sensitive skin needs.</p>
<p>Because I am currently on disability and because I was a student for 4 years, I barely make enough to pay the monthly bills. So, I am now trying to revive the soap company and make it so that I can be self sufficiant, get off disability and create wholesome, green and natural products for the whole family!</p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get!</h3>
<p>This is where you come in. I am going to offer some amazing perks for those who donate and help. Every little bit counts.</p>
<p>Most of the funds will be used to buy the oils and supplies needed to make the soaps. I have also figured in the new artwork and design fees as well as the website and shopping cart feature.</p>
<p>I will also need to purchase a small tent in order to do outdoor craft fairs and also a cpl tables. I will also need an iPad in order to maintain inventory, recipes and also to process payments through Square. A Point of Sale system would be over $4000 but now because of Apple, the Ipad and Square... POS is now obsolete!</p>
<p>The perks are pretty amazing! and now that I have decided to also create the skin care line, each donation will get an item from the new Joseph Nicolas line. I will have lip gloss, body butters, beard oil, skin cleanser and an amazing organic goats milk anti aging line especially created for women!</p>
<p>All funds will be used for initial start up, if I am able to purchase things at a discount or on sale, then any extra funds will be donated to The Trevor Project, Broadway Cares Equity Fights Aids and Broadway Barks.</p>

Because of the bladder cancer's return, I was no longer able to make soap and adhere to the soap making process as I constantly had to use the restroom. After another 3 months of BCG, I was told the cancer had metastasized and I had inoperable liver cancer and basically a year to live. I went thru 7 cycles of chemotherapy from Nov of 2011 to May of 2012 consiting of a 9 hour day, a 6 hour day 8 days later and a very painful shot, then a 14 day break.
In April I was told they could not see any tumors or lesions on my liver and my lymph system was no longer swollen. I have basically beaten cancer and I owe it to changing what I eat and put in my body. (only organic and all natural) A positive attitude, amazing friends around the world on Facebook, and using natural products. I was given a second chance and so far have been cancer free for 4 months. I did this all on my own, as my family did not think I was worth a phone call or even a get well card. Maybe because they don't approve of my lifestyle. 
I love making and creating Organic soaps and skin care products. They are allergen free and I use only the purest and most natural ingriedents and essential oils. The new skin care line I am creating will be amazing and will be called Joseph Nicolas. I am creating recipes that will be friendly for cancer patients and those with sensitive skin needs.
Because I am currently on disability and because I was a student for 4 years, I barely make enough to pay the monthly bills. So, I am now trying to revive the soap company and make it so that I can be self sufficiant, get off disability and create wholesome, green and natural products for the whole family!
What I Need & What You Get!
This is where you come in. I am going to offer some amazing perks for those who donate and help. Every little bit counts.
Most of the funds will be used to buy the oils and supplies needed to make the soaps. I have also figured in the new artwork and design fees as well as the website and shopping cart feature.
I will also need to purchase a small tent in order to do outdoor craft fairs and also a cpl tables. I will also need an iPad in order to maintain inventory, recipes and also to process payments through Square. A Point of Sale system would be over $4000 but now because of Apple, the Ipad and Square... POS is now obsolete!
The perks are pretty amazing! and now that I have decided to also create the skin care line, each donation will get an item from the new Joseph Nicolas line. I will have lip gloss, body butters, beard oil, skin cleanser and an amazing organic goats milk anti aging line especially created for women!
All funds will be used for initial start up, if I am able to purchase things at a discount or on sale, then any extra funds will be donated to The Trevor Project, Broadway Cares Equity Fights Aids and Broadway Barks.

<p>Horsepower.com was built to connect local small farmers and buyers within our very own communities.</p>
<p>The founder's dream for Horsepower.com include:</p>
<ul>
<li>knowing your local farmer and what his or her practices are (is he or she using pesticides?)</li>
<li>delivering food that taste better because it was grown locally and didn't travel 1000 miles</li>
<li>reducing the costs of food and increasing the profit for the small farmer. Remember- no middle man. </li>

<p>These are just some of the great ideas we want to work on. We also want to hear from you about any ideas you have for our site.</p>
<p><strong>User Education</strong>: Farmers are are a traditional group, and we want our site to work for them, not the other way around.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>We believe in a food system that runs on Horsepower.com. The implications are huge: imagine just one family getting their weekly groceries not from a supermarket, but from a farmer down the street. This reduces transportation costs and time, allows the family to know what they're eating and where it came from, and helps the farmer create connections so that his business grows. On the flipside, backyard farmers can sell what they grow without having to pay farmer's market fees or spending too much time marketing their products. We also believe strongly in encouraging consumers to buy local when their budgets allow, to care about how their food is grown - whether that's conventionally or organically - and to meet and know their farmers. If you buy local, the money stays in your community. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p><strong>Pronounced: Re-sip-row-tee</strong></p>
<p><em>re: </em>to bring back,</p>
<p><em>recip:</em> two-way,</p>
<p><em>Pro:</em> professionalism,</p>
<p><em>ty:</em> community.</p>
<p class=""yiv808465624msonormal""><a href=""http://www.reciproty.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.reciproty.com</a>  is a new and unique community based website that harnesses &amp; organizes global, national, and neighborhood resources on a <strong>local</strong> level. ReciProty is for all members of their community to build a supportive network for themselves and their loved ones. Members can connect to trusted relationships, seek support and financial opportunities, generate solutions and share reliable resources. ReciProty even helps businesses connect to <strong>new</strong> and <strong>existing</strong> customers. ReciProty was developed to strengthen your community support system and accelerate your networking and financial opportunities.</p>
<p class=""yiv808465624msonormal"">What makes ReciProty unique is that it brings people together so they can help each other whether it’s <strong>online or in person twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week</strong>. ReciProty gives you the perfect opportunity to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Promote Your Business Instantly</li>
<li>Network with Members You Trust</li>
<li>Announce Events and Opportunities</li>
<li>Create or Join Local Networking Groups</li>
<li>Communicate Privately with Members</li>
<li>Generate Leads and Share Referrals 24/7</li>
<li>Seek Support for Loved Ones Across the Miles</li>
<li>Access and/or Offer Support in 1000+ Categories</li>
<li>Donate to Non-Profits and Support Their Causes</li>
<li>Share Personal and Business Resources to Stay Informed</li>
<li>Post Discounts and Connect to New and Existing Customers</li>
</ul><p>ReciProty even supports domestic, artistic, or professional services that have limited resources to market themselves. Even the unemployed can look for work or generate money-making opportunities. There is great comfort in knowing support is there when you need it most. When individuals and businesses thrive, communities thrive.</p>
<h2><strong>How It All Began</strong></h2>
<p>People need help in so many ways. Some have an existing support system, while others don’t know who to turn to. Either way, most of the time, there is still not enough support.</p>
<p>My vision for ReciProty comes from my life-changing challenges and experiences with others. I created ReciProty to simplify and narrow the search for information and resources, so that people could find relief and the help they need so desperately. This website was customized to provide people with a place to connect with members of their own community, build a support system for themselves, and even find resources for their loved ones.</p>
<p>Despite lacking the prior knowledge of how to develop an online productive networking site, ReciProty was created from a web architecture and on a word document for my programmer to program. The Networking Members’ section alone was over 100 pages. It has been three years, but with focus, determination, huge financial risks, and a small, but talented team, ReciProty has finally become reality.</p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://www.reciproty.com/news/12-04-29/A_Vision_Becoming_A_Reality.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""A Vision Becoming Reality"">http://www.reciproty.com/news/12-04-29/A_Vision_Becoming_A_Reality.aspx</a><br/></strong></p>
<h2><strong>Why Support ReciProty?</strong></h2>
<p>We are all in need now and then, and nobody can succeed without the constructive support of others. When you support ReciProty, you are not only increasing support for yourself and people in your community, you are also supporting people who support you. Some people touch your heart, mind, and soul through their words. You have an opportunity to bring resources, answers, relief, and most importantly, <strong>hope</strong> in an<strong> instant</strong>to the people who need it most. <strong>If you believe ReciProty can help at least one person, that makes your contribution priceless. </strong></p>
<p>ReciProty is currently online and actively building in the greater Portland, Oregon area. Create your profile in the 97205 zip code area to see how it has been helpful for many of its members. ReciProty also travels with you wherever you go. Whenever you create a profile in a particular zip code area, you will be able to network instantly with all of ReciProty’s members within that area.</p>
<p>Developing and marketing a website like ReciProty is very expensive. I have borrowed all funds thus far to bring ReciProty to reality. The goal amount is very minimal compared to all of the costs thus far. Your financial support will help with some of the costs for enhancements and marketing, all of which will give the site the momentum it needs to thrive.</p>
<h2><strong>What if we Exceed our Goal?</strong></h2>
<p>Your contribution will help ReciProty live up to its fullest potential. People will be able to get the help they need, when they need it most. If ReciProty exceeds it goal by a substantial amount, these additional funds would be available to hire the staff required to assist with the overall internal and external operations. Additionally, ReciProty’s innovative site would be able to:</p>

<h2><strong>How Can I Support ReciProty?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Your Contribution Means So Much.</strong> No amount is too large or too small. Just select the perk that you would like to recieve to the right. You will then be led to a page that will guide you through the process. You will have the option to receive the specific perk or to offer a contribution. You can always contribute more than the stated amount for the perk reward that you would like to receive. For some, international shipping fees will apply.</p>
<p>Indiegogo is unlike most crowd funding websites! Not only do they accept creative projects from almost all categories, but they also allow campaigns to receive funds with their Flexible Funding Option. This option will make it possible for ReciProty to keep contributed funds, however, if ReciProty does not reach its goal, fees paid to Indiegogo are higher. Therefore, the goal is to reach or exceed its goal. With your help, we can surely do it! The more funds that ReciProty receives, the more people ReciProty can help.  </p>
<h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h2>

Pronounced: Re-sip-row-tee
re: to bring back,
recip: two-way,
Pro: professionalism,
ty: community.
www.reciproty.com  is a new and unique community based website that harnesses & organizes global, national, and neighborhood resources on a local level. ReciProty is for all members of their community to build a supportive network for themselves and their loved ones. Members can connect to trusted relationships, seek support and financial opportunities, generate solutions and share reliable resources. ReciProty even helps businesses connect to new and existing customers. ReciProty was developed to strengthen your community support system and accelerate your networking and financial opportunities.
What makes ReciProty unique is that it brings people together so they can help each other whether it’s online or in person twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. ReciProty gives you the perfect opportunity to:

Promote Your Business Instantly
Network with Members You Trust

ReciProty even supports domestic, artistic, or professional services that have limited resources to market themselves. Even the unemployed can look for work or generate money-making opportunities. There is great comfort in knowing support is there when you need it most. When individuals and businesses thrive, communities thrive.
How It All Began
People need help in so many ways. Some have an existing support system, while others don’t know who to turn to. Either way, most of the time, there is still not enough support.
My vision for ReciProty comes from my life-changing challenges and experiences with others. I created ReciProty to simplify and narrow the search for information and resources, so that people could find relief and the help they need so desperately. This website was customized to provide people with a place to connect with members of their own community, build a support system for themselves, and even find resources for their loved ones.
Despite lacking the prior knowledge of how to develop an online productive networking site, ReciProty was created from a web architecture and on a word document for my programmer to program. The Networking Members’ section alone was over 100 pages. It has been three years, but with focus, determination, huge financial risks, and a small, but talented team, ReciProty has finally become reality.
http://www.reciproty.com/news/12-04-29/A_Vision_Becoming_A_Reality.aspx
Why Support ReciProty?
We are all in need now and then, and nobody can succeed without the constructive support of others. When you support ReciProty, you are not only increasing support for yourself and people in your community, you are also supporting people who support you. Some people touch your heart, mind, and soul through their words. You have an opportunity to bring resources, answers, relief, and most importantly, hope in an instantto the people who need it most. If you believe ReciProty can help at least one person, that makes your contribution priceless. 
ReciProty is currently online and actively building in the greater Portland, Oregon area. Create your profile in the 97205 zip code area to see how it has been helpful for many of its members. ReciProty also travels with you wherever you go. Whenever you create a profile in a particular zip code area, you will be able to network instantly with all of ReciProty’s members within that area.
Developing and marketing a website like ReciProty is very expensive. I have borrowed all funds thus far to bring ReciProty to reality. The goal amount is very minimal compared to all of the costs thus far. Your financial support will help with some of the costs for enhancements and marketing, all of which will give the site the momentum it needs to thrive.
What if we Exceed our Goal?
Your contribution will help ReciProty live up to its fullest potential. People will be able to get the help they need, when they need it most. If ReciProty exceeds it goal by a substantial amount, these additional funds would be available to hire the staff required to assist with the overall internal and external operations. Additionally, ReciProty’s innovative site would be able to:

Showcase members and businesses that make a difference
Showcase non-profit organizations and their contributions
Create enhancements to customize the evolving needs of its members
Establish a framework to notify members of the support available to them
Reach more people in need, more effectively, and much more quickly
When emergencies occur, or when in need, time, resources, and opportunities are priceless. ReciProty bridges the gap between needs and resources. It's that simple!
How Can I Support ReciProty?
Your Contribution Means So Much. No amount is too large or too small. Just select the perk that you would like to recieve to the right. You will then be led to a page that will guide you through the process. You will have the option to receive the specific perk or to offer a contribution.

<p>Friendly Fork is
building a community of communities! Our goal is to take the local movement
global. We are a mission-driven, community-oriented, socially responsible online
food and wellness hub in our infancy. </p>
<p>Our user-friendly
website highlights the best local farms, farmers’ markets, grocers, producers,
restaurants, holistic wellness providers, and non-profit organizations, who
together are the heartbeat of our communities. Friendly Fork maps show local
connections within a 100-mile radius of our members. Our maps show restaurants,
farms, and producers with visual connections between farmers and their local
diners, markets and their food supply, and more to show where your goods and
services are coming from and what they are made of. </p>
<p>Knowledge of source
and production methods is the key to making informed decisions about how we
treat our bodies and our world. We are on a mission to introduce you to
real people, their great businesses, their social and environmental concern,
and how they give back to their communities.  Whether helping you to connect more with your
own community or introducing your neighbors both near and far, Friendly Fork
strives to help you feel at home in every community!</p>

<p>Friendly Fork is creating a business model in which success is not measured by the

environmental responsibility as a <a href=""http://www.bcorporation.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">pending
B-Corp Certified Corporation</a>. Friendly Fork staff can also be found volunteering in their

<p>Friendly Fork's Enhanced
Menus are here to help you make informed decisions when dining out and to help
make the dining experience extremely easy for you and restaurant staff. Our Premier Member, Hearth and Candle Restaurant of Jeffersonville, VT clearly identifies
what allergens are contained in their menu items below. Notice <span>that the organic grass fed beef used in the Beef
Burger comes from Old Homestead Farm, which is less than 7 miles from the
restaurant.</span> </p>

<p>I am a citizen of the world. I feel together we need to share what we can for the greater good of our neighbors and our planet. I believe that deep down all people desire good health and safe food. As a community of equals we have the ability to provide healthy food for all people so no-one goes hungry, ever.</p>
<p>I have been an organic farmer, a chef, and a restaurant owner. I have been a regular volunteer in all the communities I have lived. I am grateful for help and support I have received from community, family and friends and believe in giving back wherever I am able.  </p>
<p>I love to hike, bike, ski, snowshoe, and enjoy the beauty our planet provides us. Hockey is my passion! I love to create great meals from locally sourced ingredients.</p>
<p>I am a single dad who raised two wonderful daughters, Erin and Gwenn. My kids are my pride and joy and mean the world to me! They are my source of inspiration!</p>
<p>Together we can build a better world! Thank you for your support.</p>
<p>Peace,</p>

<p>I’m an entertainer and a poet, infatuated with the concept of community spirit and dedicated to living to serve. I have extensive food industry experience, appreciation for efficiency and sustainability, and a desire to develop my social networks. These events and feelings formed after acquiring a bachelor degree in Applied Economics &amp; Management at Cornell University. Shortly after graduating I returned to Ithaca, NY, falling in love with its gorges, nature centers, and inhabitants. I wish to strengthen my community by bringing people together through food, wellness, and performance.</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>

<p>Before graduating from the University of Vermont with a degree in business, my desire to play a role in the local food revolution was born from my own search for personal health and wellness. Driven to connect people to their local food systems, I was introduced to founder John Kearns by the UVM Sustainable Food Systems Initiative. I grew up in Massachusetts, embracing the outdoors while hunting, fishing, skiing &amp; hiking or just walking in the woods. I enjoy cooking all that I gather from the land, the sea, or nearest farm.</p>
<p>Cheers to good health,</p>

<p>The creation of
Friendly Fork has been done on a shoestring budget. We have scraped up every
penny so we could bring you a new way to look for the local food and wellness
providers you seek, while supporting the non-profit organizations who make our communities
whole. With no formal experience in web design, our team has built our Beta
website to show you our concept. We have been fueled by passion to create this
mission driven company. Now it is time to
expand.</p>

<p>We have compiled an
incredible data base of like-minded businesses we feel would make great

<p>We need to hire

</div></div>","We are a small team of
health and wellness enthusiasts, founded by John Kearns in Vermont. Our passion
is for good healthy food. We love organically raised food and encourage organic
farming practices. We strive to support our local eateries and family run green
grocers. All of us have a strong belief in all things local, not only when we
are at home but when we travel to new communities.
We are people who believe
in social equality and environmental responsibility. We care deeply for all
people and our planet. We are people who help out in our communities. Together
we have a strong desire to be a driving force promoting businesses who care. We
are creating a business which is a force for good!


Friendly Fork is a mission-driven, community oriented and socially
     responsible, online food and wellness hub. 
Our beta website is just the seedling we have planted;
     we will be growing all across Canada & the US, and then the world.
A one stop shop to source the best local food and wellness businesses; farms, farmers'markets, grocers, food & wellness product creators, restaurants, wellness providers who are socially & environmentally conscious, care for you, and community as a whole!
Our Enhanced Menus for
     restaurants identify the 8 FDA or Health Canada 11 food allergens plus
     gluten if contained in any dish served, while also highlighting sourcing of ingredients,
     raising & harvesting practices, as well as other dietary restrictions
     concerning the food being served.
We have created Friendly Fork Local Maps to promote
     the local connections and visually highlight how interconnected our
     local food systems are on the community level.
It is our goal to connect people with the best local
     businesses run by real people who are actively involved in
     their community, have socially
     and environmentally responsible business practices, and give

mission. You may even find you can be rewarded for your input! 






                
Friendly Fork is
building a community of communities! Our goal is to take the local movement
global. We are a mission-driven, community-oriented, socially responsible online
food and wellness hub in our infancy. 
Our user-friendly
website highlights the best local farms, farmers’ markets, grocers, producers,
restaurants, holistic wellness providers, and non-profit organizations, who
together are the heartbeat of our communities. Friendly Fork maps show local
connections within a 100-mile radius of our members. Our maps show restaurants,
farms, and producers with visual connections between farmers and their local
diners, markets and their food supply, and more to show where your goods and
services are coming from and what they are made of. 
Knowledge of source
and production methods is the key to making informed decisions about how we
treat our bodies and our world. We are on a mission to introduce you to
real people, their great businesses, their social and environmental concern,
and how they give back to their communities.  Whether helping you to connect more with your
own community or introducing your neighbors both near and far, Friendly Fork
strives to help you feel at home in every community!


                
Friendly Fork is creating a business model in which success is not measured by the
large profits of a few people but by the benefits of our services to our
members, communities, and planet. Friendly Fork has committed to social and
environmental responsibility as a pending
B-Corp Certified Corporation. Friendly Fork staff can also be found volunteering in their
communities, collecting produce for their local food banks, helping coach youth
sports, or tutoring in their community schools.


                While promoting great food is part of our core, we feel the need to share with those in need of food security and also to help find solutions to food allergy issues.




5% of profits will go
toward food assistance programs. 


5% of profits will be
put toward food allergy research. 


                
                
We're building a company which believes in our employees and the communities who support our mission. We are happy to reward them for their encouragement! 



5% of profits will go
back to organizations in our Friendly Fork communities.

A 5% profit sharing
plan, progressive benefit programs, and pay above livable wages will be
provided to all employees.

                
                


Friendly Fork is grateful to the many non-profit organizations who provide great services to all our communities. We promote non-profits on our site at no cost. Our hope is you may find and support these organizations in your own way, thanks!
Each community page hosts a community spirit section highlighting non-profit community organizations.
Non-profit organizations are profiled as farms, wellness providers and more.
Within their Community Spirit section, our member profiles highlight their own dedication to giving back.

                

At Friendly Fork this is just the start. As we grow, the percentages and benefits provided will continue to increase as well. We strive to be the change we seek!



                


Each Friendly Fork Community has its own page.

Each Community Page also includes a Community Spirit section, a
Community Map, and a Community Events Calendar.
Each member's profile includes a logo, a description, a local
connections map, social media & website links, reviews & ratings, and
an individualized community spirit section.

Enhanced Menus have also been
developed for restaurants. 


An Enhanced Menu identifies locally sourced ingredients from
area farmers and producers in individual dishes.


They also identify the FDA 8 most common food allergens and
gluten when contained within a menu item.


Social, religious, and other concerns including
vegetarian, vegan, humanely raised, Halal, or Kosher are identified when
possible.


This knowledge makes ordering a meal much easier for both you
and restaurant staff.


Extremely reasonable membership fees help members recoup costs
with an average of only 1-5 new clients per year.


Our website promotes community members and non-profit
organizations without external ads.


A navigational tutorial video on the live site is provided to
help you get started.

Friendly Fork is free for folks seeking the best community connections! 

Amazing offers for new members are available during our
crowdfunding campaign!


                
                
At Friendly Fork we provide
you with the knowledge of where your food is coming from and where it is being
sourced to. The map below from our Premier Member Rogues' Harbor Restaurant
of Lansing, NY shows how they source food from 11 farms and 7 food
producers all within their 100 mile local radius. On our live website you can
click on any of the icons to find out more about other farms and producers! 

                
                
                      

                
                
Friendly Fork's Enhanced
Menus are here to help you make informed decisions when dining out and to help
make the dining experience extremely easy for you and restaurant staff. Our Premier Member, Hearth and Candle Restaurant of Jeffersonville, VT clearly identifies
what allergens are contained in their menu items below. Notice that the organic grass fed beef used in the Beef
Burger comes from Old Homestead Farm, which is less than 7 miles from the
restaurant. 

                
                




                
I am a citizen of the world. I feel together we need to share what we can for the greater good of our neighbors and our planet. I believe that deep down all people desire good health and safe food. As a community of equals we have the ability to provide healthy food for all people so no-one goes hungry, ever.
I have been an organic farmer, a chef, and a restaurant owner. I have been a regular volunteer in all the communities I have lived. I am grateful for help and support I have received from community, family and friends and believe in giving back wherever I am able.  
I love to hike, bike, ski, snowshoe, and enjoy the beauty our planet provides us. Hockey is my passion! I love to create great meals from locally sourced ingredients.
I am a single dad who raised two wonderful daughters, Erin and Gwenn. My kids are my pride and joy and mean the world to me! They are my source of inspiration!
Together we can build a better world! Thank you for your support.
Peace,
John
                
I’m an entertainer and a poet, infatuated with the concept of community spirit and dedicated to living to serve. I have extensive food industry experience, appreciation for efficiency and sustainability, and a desire to develop my social networks. These events and feelings formed after acquiring a bachelor degree in Applied Economics & Management at Cornell University. Shortly after graduating I returned to Ithaca, NY, falling in love with its gorges, nature centers, and inhabitants. I wish to strengthen my community by bringing people together through food, wellness, and performance.
Best wishes,
Rem


                

Before graduating from the University of Vermont with a degree in business, my desire to play a role in the local food revolution was born from my own search for personal health and wellness. Driven to connect people to their local food systems, I was introduced to founder John Kearns by the UVM Sustainable Food Systems Initiative. I grew up in Massachusetts, embracing the outdoors while hunting, fishing, skiing & hiking or just walking in the woods. I enjoy cooking all that I gather from the land, the sea, or nearest farm.
Cheers to good health,
Harry

The creation of
Friendly Fork has been done on a shoestring budget. We have scraped up every
penny so we could bring you a new way to look for the local food and wellness
providers you seek, while supporting the non-profit organizations who make our communities
whole. With no formal experience in web design, our team has built our Beta
website to show you our concept. We have been fueled by passion to create this
mission driven company. Now it is time to
expand.



                
We have compiled an
incredible data base of like-minded businesses we feel would make great
additions to the Friendly Fork family. We need to hire a team of
representatives to reach out to these businesses all across the United States,
Canada, and the world.



                
We need to hire
support staff to complete our team of professionals. By hiring programmers,
coders and IT professionals for the Friendly Fork team, we will be able to
build a more user friendly website and phone application. This is a costly yet
worthwhile venture which will streamline our process and help things run
efficiently.


                
What we have created so
far has been done on aging PCs and laptops. We need to upgrade to more up-to-date equipment and software to improve our efficiency and capabilities.


                
It is our goal to be able to multiply ten-fold in donations the support you generously give to help Friendly Fork create our Community of Communities. With your support in helping us build a talented team of professionals and purchasing efficient IT infrastructure, growth will happen quickly. We will provide you with a great, socially responsible food and wellness hub you can be proud to have helped get started. Your support, encouragement, and ideas will help make the Friendly Fork community of communities a driving force for change in the business world! Thank you for any help you can share!

<b style=""font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: 0px;"">If you know a little one and sleep time is the most difficult part of the day - then Dream Wonderland is for you!</b><br/>
</h3><p>Abigail Hatherley and Tracey Savage are launching the Dream Wonderland album and merchandise HERE via Indiegogo. Support us by making a contribution or buying one of our gift packs so that we reach our goal and release our products online. Be part of the magic!</p><div></div><div>
<p><b><b style=""font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Concept</b><br/></b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>Dream Wonderland was created by a mother for her young children. It is a magical world of soothing music and illustrations specifically crafted to help parents calm and settle their children before sleep time. It gives carers much-needed relief, reducing the daily anxiety and stress that arises from coping with tired children at this often challenging time of the day. </p>
<p>While initially crafted for babies and toddlers, its imaginative, calming music has also proved a relaxing influence on children up to 13 years of age. And parents too, can benefit from these meditative melodies. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446163898/uaeuvmmomxwmmmpgsaji.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: 0px;"">Abigail with Maddie and Callum in 2009</span></p>
<div>
<p>“The plan was for my two children, Maddie and Callum, to look forward to their pre-sleep routine. So I devised an imaginary world that they could travel to when they fell asleep - Dream Wonderland - somewhere magical, full of wonder,” says composer and creator Abigail Hatherley.</p>
<p>""I also wanted to create something that was not only musically rich and restful, but that would also stimulate their imagination, their vocabulary and their understanding of the world around them.” Studies show that bedtime routines including restful music can be beneficial for children. Listening to music from an early age activates neural pathways in the brain, inspiring creativity, while boosting intellectual and emotional abilities. </p>
<p>Initially the album started as a handful of songs that Abigail played in her home. But after seeing the calming results with her own children and their enjoyment of the music Abigail began sharing it with family and friends. “My friends with children were interested to hear about what I was creating, and once I had written the first few tracks I felt Dream Wonderland was ready for its first real test. All of them came back to me with such beautiful, positive stories of how they and their kids loved the music, and that their children were soothed to sleep.”</p>

<p>Two year-old Neasa has been listening to Dream Wonderland twice a day for nearly a year. ""We started playing Dream Wonderland for Neasa when she was 18 months old,"" says her Mum, Michelle, ""It quickly became a really important part of our bedtime routine for day and night sleep times. She actively asks for 'lullabies' (as she calls it) and presses the on-button herself. And it is great that our very imaginative 6 year-old also loves the ethereal melodies and lyrics as much as Neasa does!"".</p>

The Concept



Dream Wonderland was created by a mother for her young children. It is a magical world of soothing music and illustrations specifically crafted to help parents calm and settle their children before sleep time. It gives carers much-needed relief, reducing the daily anxiety and stress that arises from coping with tired children at this often challenging time of the day. 
While initially crafted for babies and toddlers, its imaginative, calming music has also proved a relaxing influence on children up to 13 years of age. And parents too, can benefit from these meditative melodies. 

Abigail with Maddie and Callum in 2009

“The plan was for my two children, Maddie and Callum, to look forward to their pre-sleep routine. So I devised an imaginary world that they could travel to when they fell asleep - Dream Wonderland - somewhere magical, full of wonder,” says composer and creator Abigail Hatherley.
""I also wanted to create something that was not only musically rich and restful, but that would also stimulate their imagination, their vocabulary and their understanding of the world around them.” Studies show that bedtime routines including restful music can be beneficial for children. Listening to music from an early age activates neural pathways in the brain, inspiring creativity, while boosting intellectual and emotional abilities. 
Initially the album started as a handful of songs that Abigail played in her home. But after seeing the calming results with her own children and their enjoyment of the music Abigail began sharing it with family and friends. “My friends with children were interested to hear about what I was creating, and once I had written the first few tracks I felt Dream Wonderland was ready for its first real test. All of them came back to me with such beautiful, positive stories of how they and their kids loved the music, and that their children were soothed to sleep.”







Testimonials


Two year-old Neasa has been listening to Dream Wonderland twice a day for nearly a year. ""We started playing Dream Wonderland for Neasa when she was 18 months old,"" says her Mum, Michelle, ""It quickly became a really important part of our bedtime routine for day and night sleep times. She actively asks for 'lullabies' (as she calls it) and presses the on-button herself. And it is great that our very imaginative 6 year-old also loves the ethereal melodies and lyrics as much as Neasa does!"".





Dream Wonderland's No. 1 Fan, Neasa (age 2)
“A delightful, soothing original song collection: my baby boy knows it’s time for bed when we put the CD on at night and it makes for a peaceful time for the whole family."" - Sophie, mother of three.""For my pre-school daughter the melodies, a mix of delicate lullabies and gentle adventures, are mesmerising and soothing."" - April, mother of one.""I loved it. The songs are original and yet so familiar - very comfortable and comforting. The CD has a beautifully dreamy quality to it - perfect for sleep time."" - Cath, mother of one.
But before we tell you any more take a trip into the enchanting world of Dream Wonderland with the title track video accompanied by our illustrations...


We want to bring Dream Wonderland to the world and you can helpAfter the initial feedback Abigail was convinced that children and parents could benefit from an entire Dream Wonderland album, helping not only with sleep time but also to introduce young children to quality music from a young age.  She then spent the next two years writing and editing the final album of 9 tracks. ""Each song tells a story and all are linked into one continuous soundscape, so there are no pauses between tracks that can so easily bring a child back from the brink of a restful sleep. As the album progresses the songs become calmer and calmer until the final track, a 10-minute instrumental, leads them off to sleep; to their very own Dream Wonderland.”""Since the very first lullaby was written nearly 4 years ago, my children still fall asleep to these songs and Dream Wonderland has grown into something I’m very proud of. Now I hope it will delight and inspire children (and parents) everywhere.”Whether for home, pre-school, the car or at Gran’s house Dream Wonderland is a must have for parents and carers, and you can own a 1st edition signed copy or buy one of our beautiful gift packs for Christmas today. Buy a copy today & help us bring Dream Wonderland to life!But we don’t want your money for nothing – we want your support to help get Dream Wonderland up and running, to make for happier children and parents around the world.

<p></p>
<p>Travel planning is a major sore point for 49% of travelers as you spend on average 29 days
visiting 20+ websites during the research and planning phase of your trip.</p>
<p>While the Internet has
changed the way travelers think about their travel needs and in particular how
they go about their travel activities, this is a time consuming process because
resources for trip-planning are scattered. While you can find information
about specific destinations with a limited service offering, it's hard to find
a fully baked itinerary that connects the dots and provides you with all the
information needed right away.</p>
<p>One of the pioneers of this
service is discount air fare brokers that took advantage of the Internet by
offering tickets online at discounted rates, but this is all that they offer
and where their service ends. Similar service providers have increased price
competition and computerized reservation systems have increased the speed and
efficiency between the agency to customer transaction, there are also increased start-up costs for other service providers who wish to be competitive and still these providers are not offering a full service. </p><p>Moreover, industry
competition and the increased number of travel options available have made it
necessary for smaller service providers to establish themselves as being able
to offer one type of travel service. Those that may offer more than one
service, outsource the rest and still do not have a full service offering to give their clientele. There are currently no providers who specialize solely on providing
travelers with a once stop solution that enables them to deal with a company that acts directly on
their behalf without having to outsource services needed to multiple suppliers.</p>
<p>These facts prompted us to
dig deeper into finding a solution, where travelers can get their information from
professionals and really see what they want to see. This is where we started to
envision Byva Travel and all the possible benefits it could offer.</p>
<p>At Byva Travel we understand
that you are driven by the need to discover, the quest to know more about the
world you live in and the people you share your world with and we aim to bring
you a complete direct service offering that will cover all your travel needs
while at the same time being customizable to your specific interests for a
brand new travel experience.</p>
<p>Byva Travel's own website's platform
will take you through a journey of discovery through authentic services that
are based on real experiences. Our website's platform will allow you to not only discover these
experiences but also book them to enable you to live them in real life, allowing you to discover
the uniqueness of our service and thus experience destinations in a new way.</p>
<p>Our website's platform will not only
be unique in that it will provide you with all the information that you need to
make an informed decision about your chosen destination and give you all the
services needed. It will also be fully customizable to provide you with additional services that
you might like to book. <br/></p><p>Our website's platform will also serve as a portal to not only our own experiences,
but one where travelers such as yourself are talking, sharing ideas and shaping new realms of
travel services to break through the traditional concepts and create a world
in which collaboration and you are king.<br/><br/>              <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1003246/files/20141110171428-000000000012.jpg?1415668468"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b><br/>ABOUT US - THE BYVA TRAVEL DREAM TEAM </b></p><b></b><p>

traveling the world?  Do you want to
visit places far away?  Do you believe
travel could enrich your life? If you answered, “Yes” to any of these questions, you want
to know what we're all about.Our
popular culture reinforces the idea that travel planning is difficult and time
consuming. We're out to change that fallacious idea one Byva Travel plan at a
time!Whether it’s a small group of travelers looking for an adventure package
or an executive in New York looking for a private charter plane hire. A beach
vacation somewhere exotic or a city break for the weekend. A visit to the south of
France or the heart of Cape Town.  Byva Travel will cover all needs in relation to any travel services needed. Help us establish a travel service that will serve you wherever you may be.One
well planned trip can change a person’s ideas about what he or she can
accomplish for the rest of their lives. Empower us to make this vision a reality
with a contribution to our project today!   MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT 

Travel planning is a major sore point for 49% of travelers as you spend on average 29 days
visiting 20+ websites during the research and planning phase of your trip.
While the Internet has
changed the way travelers think about their travel needs and in particular how
they go about their travel activities, this is a time consuming process because
resources for trip-planning are scattered. While you can find information
about specific destinations with a limited service offering, it's hard to find
a fully baked itinerary that connects the dots and provides you with all the
information needed right away.
One of the pioneers of this
service is discount air fare brokers that took advantage of the Internet by
offering tickets online at discounted rates, but this is all that they offer
and where their service ends. Similar service providers have increased price
competition and computerized reservation systems have increased the speed and
efficiency between the agency to customer transaction, there are also increased start-up costs for other service providers who wish to be competitive and still these providers are not offering a full service. Moreover, industry
competition and the increased number of travel options available have made it
necessary for smaller service providers to establish themselves as being able
to offer one type of travel service. Those that may offer more than one
service, outsource the rest and still do not have a full service offering to give their clientele. There are currently no providers who specialize solely on providing
travelers with a once stop solution that enables them to deal with a company that acts directly on
their behalf without having to outsource services needed to multiple suppliers.
These facts prompted us to
dig deeper into finding a solution, where travelers can get their information from
professionals and really see what they want to see. This is where we started to
envision Byva Travel and all the possible benefits it could offer.
At Byva Travel we understand
that you are driven by the need to discover, the quest to know more about the
world you live in and the people you share your world with and we aim to bring
you a complete direct service offering that will cover all your travel needs
while at the same time being customizable to your specific interests for a
brand new travel experience.
Byva Travel's own website's platform
will take you through a journey of discovery through authentic services that
are based on real experiences. Our website's platform will allow you to not only discover these
experiences but also book them to enable you to live them in real life, allowing you to discover
the uniqueness of our service and thus experience destinations in a new way.
Our website's platform will not only
be unique in that it will provide you with all the information that you need to
make an informed decision about your chosen destination and give you all the
services needed. It will also be fully customizable to provide you with additional services that
you might like to book. Our website's platform will also serve as a portal to not only our own experiences,
but one where travelers such as yourself are talking, sharing ideas and shaping new realms of
travel services to break through the traditional concepts and create a world
in which collaboration and you are king.              ABOUT US - THE BYVA TRAVEL DREAM TEAM 
Byva Travel members are experienced travel industry
professionals with too many years to count in the travel industry allowing us
to have acquired a versatile experience in all areas of this industry. 
We are obsessed with creating memorable travel experiences
that are created to suit your needs as more often than not when companies
design new programs they contain preliminary flaws and don’t offer you an all
in one solution. Our goal is to stay dedicated to quality because we know your
travel needs are at stake and have designed a unique plan that is second to
none for your traveling needs.

<p>The Stroopie Co., was founded with the goal of producing top notch Stroopies, while make a difference to the refugee population that is resettling in Lancaster.  </p>
<p><b>So what is a Stroopie?  </b>A Stroopie is a Dutch stroopwafel, that is made here locally.   It is a cinnamon cookie, made with a waffle iron with a layer of homemade caramel in the inside.   Traditionally, the Stroopie is placed on top of your hot beverage to rewarm.  It is also great with ice cream!   Some of our Stroopies are half-dipped in Wilbur Chocolate.  Other varieties include specialty dipped chocolate with pecan and espresso and a gluten-free line.   Stroopies are hand-made with local ingredients from companies that are committed to being socially responsible.   See more at our website:  <a href=""http://www.stroopies.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""text-decoration: underline;"">www.stroopies.com</a> or like us at our facebook page: <u> <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Lancaster-County-Stroopies/213517678659483?ref=hl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Lancaster-County...</a></u></p>

</div></div>","The Stroopie Co. was established in 2008 in  Lancaster, PA.    Since the founding our business, we have had two main goals: 


 1) To support refugees who are starting over in Lancaster by providing meaningful employment.
2) To make high quality Stroopies to sell in Lancaster and all over the US.
Currently, there are 60 million refugees world wide who have been forced to flee their countries due to war, natural disasters, and drought.   Each year our beautiful city of Lancaster, invites approx. 1,000 of these dear folks to get re-established in our area.   In addition to the turbulent and often-traumatic path to
come to the United States, many refugees face a difficult time finding
employment once they are resettled in Lancaster due to language and cultural
barriers.        




The Stroopie Co., was founded with the goal of producing top notch Stroopies, while make a difference to the refugee population that is resettling in Lancaster.  
So what is a Stroopie?  A Stroopie is a Dutch stroopwafel, that is made here locally.   It is a cinnamon cookie, made with a waffle iron with a layer of homemade caramel in the inside.   Traditionally, the Stroopie is placed on top of your hot beverage to rewarm.  It is also great with ice cream!   Some of our Stroopies are half-dipped in Wilbur Chocolate.  Other varieties include specialty dipped chocolate with pecan and espresso and a gluten-free line.   Stroopies are hand-made with local ingredients from companies that are committed to being socially responsible.   See more at our website:  www.stroopies.com or like us at our facebook page:  https://www.facebook.com/pages/Lancaster-County...



Would you help us move our Stroopie Co. to Lancaster City?  
Currently, we are sub-leasing space and renting equipment to make our Stroopies at Groff's Candies, in Millersville, PA.
In January 2015, doors opened for us to purchase a store-front at 141 North Duke St., in Lancaster City.   We couldn't be more thrilled to be moving our Stroopie Co. into the city!   This will help us have a stronger market in downtown Lancaster and also be a more accessible location for the refugees that we are hiring.
We are proud to present, ""The Lancaster Sweet Shoppe"" where we will make and feature our Stroopies, along with Groff's Candies, and Pine View Dairy Ice Cream.   Partnering with these other businesses will allow us to offer a delightful array of treats and at the same time give us a boost in our goal  of hiring
refugees for full-time positions, giving them the tools they need to
successfully acclimate to the community as well as become successful in their
future ventures. 


                      (Representation of future sight at 141 N Duke St)

How can you help? 
By partnering with us in this campaign, you can pre-order Stroopies and help us buy the equipment that we will need at our new Shoppe at the same time.   
We need approx. $20,000 dollars to buy mixers, irons, and equipment to get us in production in our new Shoppe on Duke St..


For every $1.00 that is given, The Stroopie Co. will send you a gift certificate of the same amount to be redeemed for Stroopies at the Lancaster Sweet Shoppe, opening summer 2016.    You will also be able to redeem the gift certificate as soon as you get it at our current location at Groff's Candies at 3587 Blue Rock Rd, Lancaster, 17603.
For example, if you give a $50 dollar donation to our campaign, we will in return send you via e-mail a $50 printable gift certificate that you can redeem for Stroopies at The Lancaster Sweet Shoppe next summer or at Groff's Candies.
The Impact:
 Currently, we are making approx. 62,000 Stroopies a year to cover our fixed and variable costs.   We wholesale our Stroopies to over 50 stores in the US. 
 To date we have been able to hire 12 refugees to work seasonally at our company.   The Stroopie Co's dream is to scale and grow the business so that meaningful full-time employment can be provided to refugees resettling in Lancaster year round.   

Right now we make 1,200 Stroopies each week.   In three years we hope to be making  6,000 additional Stroopies a week, and have four refugees working full-time with the Stroopie Co.   We view it as success for our employees to either move up in leadership positions in our company, or equal success if they use our company as a spring board to leap into other occupations.

Help us spread wellness with online video workouts fusing the best of yoga, pilates,  and barre.   Core Lotus Cardio is a subscription-based service offering streaming workouts online,  inspiring people to gain wellness and fitness through a BALANCED, LOVING APPROACH TO FITNESS.
A Safe AND Effective Workout You Can Do From Home

Hello!  My name is Sarah.  As a certified teacher of all 3 major disciplines, and after working with a variety of clients in Los Angeles and abroad, they inspired me to create a workout that felt effective and challenging, but also felt centering and expansive.  I love teaching people how to change their lives by connecting with their mind, body, and spirit through yoga, pilates, and barre.  
My goal was to create a workout to promote true VIBRANT BALANCE.  
And Core Lotus Cardio was born.  

Our mission is to give busy moms, hard-working corporate employees, baby-boomers, and anyone looking to improve their health and well-being the opportunity to increase vitality, strength, flexibility, cardio fitness with a balanced workout and the convenience of always-available streaming videos.

I feel extremely honored and excited to share this with the world.  More explanation in this video...

An explanation of Core Lotus Cardio in Japanese.

Below are video highlights from various shoots during the creation phase of CLC.  The location is our home studio, but the majority if CLC library classes will be filmed in a large studio location.
Here are highlights of a ""CLC Lite"" class.

OUR GOAL
By the end of 2015, we plan on building a library of over 500 video workouts - available to our subscribers on any device through streaming.  We will also be building into the site a lifestyle community - think recipes, tips & info, and opportunities to connect and support like-minded people.




Core Lotus Cardio is a sustainable, life-long movement method that provides results, but doesn't ""crank"" just for the sake of feeling the burn.  
                          
We have seen incredible results and excitement for a fusion class like CLC.  

                            

The last 18 months have been devoted to refining and writing the 100-page manual.   We recently held our first teacher training here in Los Angeles, and have 5 beautifully talented teachers ready to start creating workouts for you!


We are asking for you to generously bring our dream to reality - we need to raise money for the production, marketing, and technology costs.  

What We Need & What You Get 
We have set a goal of $10,000 to cover our startup and production costs.  
WE ONLY NEED 100 GENEROUS PEOPLE TO BUY THE $100 PERK (1-year all-access pass) TO REACH OUR GOAL!

Marketing Costs - we will use a portion of funds to GET THE WORD OUT - we will start with Facebook, and move into additional online / social media based marketing campaigns.
Developing & integrating technology to deliver the streaming workouts.  We are working with very talented 3rd party providers to create an amazing user experience for CLC subscribers.  Technology includes: library hosting, video streaming, library user interface, & user membership administration

Production Equipment : We own a camera, and audio equipment, and we will purchase additional equipment to reduce monthly production costs from rentals - two light sources, large diffusion, headset microphone, ear-monitor for music playback, Recorder/Monitor combo.

Production Crew:  we have a team of all-star Los Angeles crew-folk that are donating their time during our development stage.  We'd like to pay them. 
Studio space rental




The PERKSAs a thank you for your part in helping us reach our goal, we have created a number of great perks to offer.  Along with our undying gratitude:
 we are offering pre-sales of our 6-month and yearly passes, so as soon as we launch you can begin to enjoy the benefits of Core Lotus Cardio!  

T-shirts!
Signature CLC moves
Custom workouts created just for you and your personal goals
Private sessions with creator Sarah Skaer!
                     The Impact

When we achieve our goal, we will be able to provide online streaming workouts that provide inspirational, loving, balanced approach to movement, health, and personal fitness - with the added convenience and affordability of doing it at home or on the go.
I am an entrepreneur at heart, having been an independent business owner since I started in the fitness industry as an instructor.   My partner in all of this is my husband who started his first business in college and has built a successful media services company.  




Risks & Challenges  
With our limited budget we have challenges with the cost of production & technology development, as we are planning to shoot several videos a month.  Crew  / human hours are a challenge as we need to run a tight production process to keep  up with our deliveries.  Also - getting the word out and rising above the noise can be a challenge.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>On May 24, 2013 my van was stolen was from outside a gig. The van was recovered a few days later, but my equipment that was in the van was not. While the police have a list of what was stolen, and I have spoken with several pawn shops, I am told that the chances of my gear being recovered are minimal. </p>
<p>The dollar amount of the gear is not excessive, but with costs from getting the van back and repaired as well as school costs, I cannot afford to replace it.</p>
<p>I am asking only for enough to get back what was lost.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Best estimates are I lost about $2500 work of equipment. Nothing uber-fancy. This was my backup system that I take to my weekly trivia gigs around Atlanta. </p>
<p>Since I am a dj, my perks are food and fun. Should you live too far for us to meet for lunch or dinner, I will send you a gift card. Should you live too far away for me to dj a party, we can figure out what to do. </p>
<p>For $10 I will thank you on my website/facebook/twitter/ etc.</p>
<p>For $25 I will take you out to lunch or dinner on a date TBD. Nothing fancy, but a way to spend time with you and give you proper thanks. As well as thank you on my website and all social media. </p>
<p>For $100 I will buy you lunch or dinner at a date TBD, as well as I will dj your party for 1 hour. Plus thanks on my website and social media. Distance from Atlanta 25 miles. </p>
<p>For $500 you will get lunch or dinner, I will DJ your party for 4 hours. As well as thanks on my website and social media. Distance from Atlanta 50 miles. </p>
<p>For $1000 you will get lunch or dinner, I will DJ your party for 7 hours. As well as thanks on my website and all social media. And I will name my van after you. Distance from Atlanta 100 miles</p>
<p>If you live too far for us to meet for lunch or dinner, I will send you a gift card. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If I dont reach my goal, I will make good to those who funded and replace what I can with the available funds. </p>
<p>If I go over my goal, I will make good on all perks, replace my missing gear, and use the extra to complete repairs on my van. ungrade my insurance and pay down debt I have incurred from this experience.    </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>I recently heard that some seniors in my area are on a wait list to get meals. Can you imagine not having food in your kitchen and not knowing where your next meal is coming from? Can you imagine being 70+yrs old, on a fixed income and have to pay for housing, medications, doctors visits, hospital visits, insurance and still have enough money to buy yourself healthy food for the month? If you can imagine that!</p>
<p>We go out to eat, and many times our leftovers get thrown away. Think about how much food gets thrown away everyday, in every city in the world. Think about the amount of food that is thrown out daily, that people who are starving would love to have. We take so many things for granted. I can't imagine being 80 years old with illnesses, having to buy medications to stay alive and keep a roof over my head with no food in my pantry. Something has to give. Right? If you only get 700.00 a month to live on, and medications alone cost 400.00 a month, how would you survive? I see this everyday in my line of work. Robbing Peter to pay Paul is no way for a senior to live.  Everyday I'm touched by a senior who is in need. Help me, Help them. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There are 15 senior citizens in my area who are going hungry. By donating to my cause, you will be helping feed a senior citizen for a whole year. I know 15 people doesnt sound like much of an impact, but think about it this way, 15 seniors are hoping that they will get fed this week. So next time you sit down to enjoy a meal, think about how you helped those 15 enjoy a hot meal as well.<br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>By donating to my cause, you will be helping raise money for the 15 seniors who are on the wait list for meals. For every $200, a senior gets meals for a year. My goal is $3,000 but anything after that will go towards other seniors in need of food or services. </p>
<p>Take a moment and think...If your neighbor was starving, would you offer them a crumb or give them a loaf of bread? Better yet, If you were starving, would you want someone to help you?  <br/>For every person who donates to my cause, you get the satisfaction of knowing you helped a senior citizen enjoy a hot meal for a whole year. You can hold your head up high, knowing that you made someones life easier. And maybe someday when you become a senior yourself, someone will be as kind to you.<br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>(Unleash the DIWO! Do-it-with-others. If you have a facebook, myspace, twitter page...PLEASE share my link with others. The more people know about my cause, the better chances I have to reach my goal!!! So if you can't donate, please pass it along to others. THANK YOU SO MUCH!)</p>

Think about the amount of food that is thrown out daily, that people who are starving would love to have. We take so many things for granted. I can't imagine being 80 years old with illnesses, having to buy medications to stay alive and keep a roof over my head with no food in my pantry. Something has to give. Right? If you only get 700.00 a month to live on, and medications alone cost 400.00 a month, how would you survive? I see this everyday in my line of work. Robbing Peter to pay Paul is no way for a senior to live.  Everyday I'm touched by a senior who is in need. Help me, Help them. 



The Impact
There are 15 senior citizens in my area who are going hungry. By donating to my cause, you will be helping feed a senior citizen for a whole year. I know 15 people doesnt sound like much of an impact, but think about it this way, 15 seniors are hoping that they will get fed this week. So next time you sit down to enjoy a meal, think about how you helped those 15 enjoy a hot meal as well.


What We Need & What You Get
By donating to my cause, you will be helping raise money for the 15 seniors who are on the wait list for meals. For every $200, a senior gets meals for a year. My goal is $3,000 but anything after that will go towards other seniors in need of food or services. 
Take a moment and think...If your neighbor was starving, would you offer them a crumb or give them a loaf of bread? Better yet, If you were starving, would you want someone to help you?  For every person who donates to my cause, you get the satisfaction of knowing you helped a senior citizen enjoy a hot meal for a whole year. You can hold your head up high, knowing that you made someones life easier. And maybe someday when you become a senior yourself, someone will be as kind to you.


Other Ways You Can Help
(Unleash the DIWO! Do-it-with-others. If you have a facebook, myspace, twitter page...PLEASE share my link with others. The more people know about my cause, the better chances I have to reach my goal!!! So if you can't donate, please pass it along to others. THANK YOU SO MUCH!)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I've been in DIY 3D printing for a long time, I started around 2007 with a water pipe based machine, then it followed a Rapman and after a Reprap Mendel. Now I have an aluminium profile based machine which resembles a MendelMax printer.</p>
<p>Once the machine worked properly mechanically, I was struck by the lack of reliable hotend, so I've been developing hotends and related gears since then.</p>

<p><strong>______________________________________________________________<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>WHO WE ARE</strong></p>
<p>We are working on creating a new facility for the Twin Cities and surrounding communities.  My 27 years of aviation experience, and 15 years in the event and museum industry, has shown me there is a strong demand for a location to educate visitors about aviation (current and historic) and have the ability to host a wide variety of events.  According to the <a href=""http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/anoka.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Air &amp; Space Smithsonian</a>, our airport is one of the most unique airports in the country.  It hosts a wide variety of aircraft, such as 1920s vintage and 1940s WWII, all the way to modern corporate jets.  Yet, the community has little ability to view, learn about, and experience these aircraft and this industry because of a poor airport design.  Because of this, I formed an experienced team that consists of Board Members, Contractor, Lawyer, Accountant, Bankers, and Airport staff that have been working hard to see this project become a success.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>HERE'S THE PROJECT</strong></p>
<p>We propose to build a 50,000 square foot facility housing three entities. On one side is an <a href=""http://www.flightlineltd.com/images/Building-Images/EventCenter%20C-G-web-2.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Event Center</a> for corporate events, trade shows, special events, wedding receptions and private parties with seating for almost 1,000 people. Word of this project has spread quickly, already resulting in hundreds of requests for event space from groups large and small.  The other side of the facility will be divided between an aviation theme <a href=""http://www.flightlineltd.com/slides/G-S.gif"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gift Shop</a> and <a href=""http://www.flightlineltd.com/slides/Rest.gif"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Restaurant</a> with seating for 300 guests. Also planned is an added <a href=""http://www.flightlineltd.com/images/Building-Images/Deck%20View%20C-G-web-2.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">exterior deck</a> and atrium seating to overlook the airport for viewing departing and arriving aircraft year round. The facility will be located in the <a href=""http://www.flightlineltd.com/images/Site-Plans/Driveway%20-%20Fence.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">southwest corner</a> of the Anoka County Airport in Blaine, Minnesota.</p>
<p>This new facility will allow visitors to view these aircraft operating on a regular basis in a very unique venue.  It will also provide a place to create events with limitless possibilities.  For example, the facility will have the ability to host educational events with veterans or icons from many industries.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHERE THE FUNDS GO</strong></p>
<p>We are seeking immediate funding to complete site development.  We are working with a bank to finance the majority of the project, but those funds are solely dedicated for building construction.  Prior to any construction, we are required to complete all <strong>site development tasks</strong>.  Tasks such as site surveying, engineering drawings, and driveway access (to name just a few) are costly, but are essential steps in moving this project forward.</p>
<p>- Without immediate funding, these tasks cannot be completed.</p>
<p>- Your pledge dollars will go directly to these type costs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE GOAL</strong></p>
<p>Aviation is my passion and it's my goal to share the many aspects of history and modern technology that surround it with as many people as possible. In the past, when someone needed help building something useful, such as a barn, the local community came together and built it. Once built, everyone would celebrate by sharing a meal under the new roof. I seek to build Flight Line Cafe` &amp; Event Center in the same manner. Help us Raise Our Barn!</p>

<p><b>  </b>A Kenyan enterprise
run by Kenyans that partners with smallholder farmers to provide both freight
and market facilitation of fresh fruits and vegetables.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431514977/zcucfuivbe09bqkhqotu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b><b></b></b></p><b>
</b><p>Figure 1: <i>Roadside fruit market
along the Thika highway-approximately 1.5 hours from Nairobi. All the vendors
are selling the same exact fruits acquired from nearby farms.</i></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p><b><u>Why
Agrarian</u></b></p>
<p>  Kenya’s
economy is heavily dependent on agriculture. In fact, 75% of Kenyans make their
living from farming, producing both for local consumption and for export. Agricultural
investments-made mostly by the hundreds of NGOs operating in the country, focus
on finding ways to increase crop and animals production. Often times, this
approach proves unsustainable because farmers become dependent on service providers-
usually NGOs using short-term project funding. Short-term success in raising
production without complementary support to transport produce to major markets
can result in oversupplying local markets, which translates into reduced income
for farmers.</p>
<p>  Agrarian is
Kenyan enterprise run by Kenyans that partners with smallholder farmers to
provide both freight and market facilitation of fresh fruits and vegetables.
Specifically, Agrarian deals in postharvest handling, transportation, and
selling of fresh fruits and vegetables from smallholder rural farmers to nearby
cities. By organizing farmers into cooperatives, Agrarian ensures an easy and
reliable transport system that allows for consistent year round delivery in
larger volumes. In doing this, Agrarian creates competitive, sustainable
services that enrich farmer’s lives while providing fresh fruits and vegetables
to consumers at competitive prices.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431515284/zays2ya0lgrdyx35ifed.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b><b></b></b></p><b>

</b><p>Figure 2: <i>Tomatoes and onions seller
along the Mombasa/Nairobi highway-approx. 2 hours from Nairobi city. Onions in the big bags in the back are awaiting transport/sale to Nairobi. The rest have to be sold individually to motorists.</i></p><p><span> </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><u>Why
Now</u></b></p>
<p>  I often
wondered why roadside vendors in different parts of Kenya sold similar farm produce.
It turns out that while smallholder farmers can get access to training that
helps improve production, finding access to major markets still remains out of
their reach due to the lack of affordable transportation. High transportation
cost is usually attributed to poor road conditions. Oversupply coupled with
produce perishability forces farmers to sell their produce at below market
rates.</p>
<p> However, Kenya has
recently experienced an expansive road rehabilitation program that has brought
many dilapidated rural roads to maintainable standards. As a result, it has
become increasingly affordable to transport farm produce from rural areas to
cities around the country. Moreover, there is a steady, albeit underreported,
growth of the middle class in Kenyan cities with a much higher purchasing
power. All these factors translate into numerous opportunities for
self-sustainability and income generation, which could easily be replicated
across the country.</p>

<p>Realize an efficient and reliable transport system that
allows smallholder farmers to easily deliver larger volumes of fresh produce to

<p><b><u>How
Agrarian Works</u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p><b><u>Partnerships</u></b></p>
<p>It would be great if
small-scale farmers didn’t have to think of transportation and marketing of
their perishable products after having grown and harvested them. Agrarian
organizes small-scale farmers into cooperatives for the purpose of transporting
their produce in bulk to major markets. By working as one unit, farmers gain a
better bargaining power and are also able to transport their produce
affordably. </p>
<p><b><u>Transport Coordination</u></b></p>
<p>Agrarian will develop a map of convenient transportation
corridors throughout the country. Standardized pickup points designed to
minimize cost of produce transportation will be established. Farmers will then
form or utilize existing cooperatives to pool together their produce for
greater efficiency during transportation. </p>
<p><b><u>Three-pronged approach</u></b></p>
<p>Agrarian is the only
transport/delivery system in Kenya with a three-pronged approach of providing
produce in the cities. These include:</p>
<p>o<span>  </span>Transport/hauling
produce to major open air markets</p>
<p>o<span>  </span>Transport
to green grocers and hotels around the cities</p>
<p>o<span>  </span>Transport/delivery
to individual homes and restaurants in the cities</p>

<p><b><u>Why
is Agrarian Unique?</u></b></p>
<p>Currently, most smallholder farmers who
manage to transport their produce to the cities usually have to go through
middlemen. The burden of perishability constrains farmers; they often have to
sell their produce at below market rate just so they can get some return out of
their investment. Agrarian bypasses middlemen and deals directly with farmers
through cooperatives. This system ensures that farmers enjoy higher prices
through collective bargaining while consumers get fresher produce at
competitive prices.</p>
<p>Moreover, with its three-pronged approach, Agrarian ensures
that fresh produce is not only limited to upmarket neighborhoods in the cities.
With its low cost approach, Agrarian can easily haul fresh produce to lower
income neighborhoods and sell them directly from the trucks.</p>
<p><b><u>Agrarian
is not a charity</u></b></p>
<p>  Despite
decades of foreign aid, poverty levels in Kenya continue to escalate and
millions of people continue to suffer. We believe in the need to assume full
control of the many economic opportunities available to help improve the
quality of life for Kenyan people. We believe that providing transport and
market facilitation for smallholder farmers will lead to job creation, enhanced
socio-economic stability, and greater purchasing power, which buys necessities
like quality education and healthcare.</p>

<h3><br/></h3></div>","My name is Marcel Owino. I was born and raised in Kenya until high school when I left to attend University in the USA. I studied Political Science and Public health and returned to Kenya last year where I now work in healthcare.                                                              Agrarian
  A Kenyan enterprise
run by Kenyans that partners with smallholder farmers to provide both freight
and market facilitation of fresh fruits and vegetables.

Figure 1: Roadside fruit market
along the Thika highway-approximately 1.5 hours from Nairobi. All the vendors
are selling the same exact fruits acquired from nearby farms.


Why
Agrarian
  Kenya’s
economy is heavily dependent on agriculture. In fact, 75% of Kenyans make their
living from farming, producing both for local consumption and for export. Agricultural
investments-made mostly by the hundreds of NGOs operating in the country, focus
on finding ways to increase crop and animals production. Often times, this
approach proves unsustainable because farmers become dependent on service providers-
usually NGOs using short-term project funding. Short-term success in raising
production without complementary support to transport produce to major markets
can result in oversupplying local markets, which translates into reduced income
for farmers.
  Agrarian is
Kenyan enterprise run by Kenyans that partners with smallholder farmers to
provide both freight and market facilitation of fresh fruits and vegetables.
Specifically, Agrarian deals in postharvest handling, transportation, and
selling of fresh fruits and vegetables from smallholder rural farmers to nearby
cities. By organizing farmers into cooperatives, Agrarian ensures an easy and
reliable transport system that allows for consistent year round delivery in
larger volumes. In doing this, Agrarian creates competitive, sustainable
services that enrich farmer’s lives while providing fresh fruits and vegetables
to consumers at competitive prices.


Figure 2: Tomatoes and onions seller
along the Mombasa/Nairobi highway-approx. 2 hours from Nairobi city. Onions in the big bags in the back are awaiting transport/sale to Nairobi. The rest have to be sold individually to motorists. Why
Now
  I often
wondered why roadside vendors in different parts of Kenya sold similar farm produce.
It turns out that while smallholder farmers can get access to training that
helps improve production, finding access to major markets still remains out of
their reach due to the lack of affordable transportation. High transportation
cost is usually attributed to poor road conditions. Oversupply coupled with
produce perishability forces farmers to sell their produce at below market
rates.
 However, Kenya has
recently experienced an expansive road rehabilitation program that has brought
many dilapidated rural roads to maintainable standards. As a result, it has
become increasingly affordable to transport farm produce from rural areas to
cities around the country. Moreover, there is a steady, albeit underreported,
growth of the middle class in Kenyan cities with a much higher purchasing
power. All these factors translate into numerous opportunities for
self-sustainability and income generation, which could easily be replicated
across the country.
Figure 3: Farmers rushing cars on highway 104 to try
and sell freshly harvested carrots and tomatoes from farms just along the highway. Because
all the farmers are selling the same perishable product, motorists often buy at
below market rates.Figure 4: All six vendors are trying to sell bananas to one motorist.Vision
Realize an efficient and reliable transport system that
allows smallholder farmers to easily deliver larger volumes of fresh produce to
cities around the country.


Goals
· 
Create competitive, sustainable
transport services that enrich farmers lives
· 
Provide fresh fruits and vegetables to
consumers at competitive prices.
How
Agrarian Works

Partnerships
It would be great if
small-scale farmers didn’t have to think of transportation and marketing of
their perishable products after having grown and harvested them. Agrarian
organizes small-scale farmers into cooperatives for the purpose of transporting
their produce in bulk to major markets. By working as one unit, farmers gain a
better bargaining power and are also able to transport their produce
affordably. 
Transport Coordination
Agrarian will develop a map of convenient transportation
corridors throughout the country. Standardized pickup points designed to
minimize cost of produce transportation will be established. Farmers will then
form or utilize existing cooperatives to pool together their produce for
greater efficiency during transportation. 
Three-pronged approach
Agrarian is the only
transport/delivery system in Kenya with a three-pronged approach of providing
produce in the cities. These include:
o  Transport/hauling
produce to major open air markets
o  Transport
to green grocers and hotels around the cities
o  Transport/delivery
to individual homes and restaurants in the cities

Why
is Agrarian Unique?
Currently, most smallholder farmers who
manage to transport their produce to the cities usually have to go through
middlemen. The burden of perishability constrains farmers; they often have to
sell their produce at below market rate just so they can get some return out of
their investment. Agrarian bypasses middlemen and deals directly with farmers
through cooperatives. This system ensures that farmers enjoy higher prices
through collective bargaining while consumers get fresher produce at
competitive prices.
Moreover, with its three-pronged approach, Agrarian ensures
that fresh produce is not only limited to upmarket neighborhoods in the cities.
With its low cost approach, Agrarian can easily haul fresh produce to lower
income neighborhoods and sell them directly from the trucks.
Agrarian
is not a charity
  Despite
decades of foreign aid, poverty levels in Kenya continue to escalate and
millions of people continue to suffer. We believe in the need to assume full
control of the many economic opportunities available to help improve the
quality of life for Kenyan people. We believe that providing transport and
market facilitation for smallholder farmers will lead to job creation, enhanced
socio-economic stability, and greater purchasing power, which buys necessities
like quality education and healthcare.


Agrarian
is specifically tailored for small-scale Kenyan farmers
  Agrarian
will handle all postharvest handling, transportation, and distribution of fresh
fruits and vegetables therefore allaying the risk factor that farmers would
otherwise have to endure. By organizing farmers into cooperatives, Agrarian
will ensure an easy and reliable transport system that allows for consistent
year round delivery in larger volumes.

<h3>The Sunlight Cafe: Our Past, Our Future</h3>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510957074/w7lscgk5uhpziozdadp8.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<p>In 1976, <a href=""http://sunlightcafevegetarian.com/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self"">our little cafe opened</a> in Seattle's Roosevelt neighborhood with a goal of serving tasty vegetarian food to this then sleepy corner of town. From the beginning, the Sunlight was passionate about serving our community nourishing food at reasonable prices and we continue that tradition today as Seattle's longest running vegetarian restaurant. But, we're not immune to change - the building we've been renting for decades will soon be sold and its time for us to be proactive about the next 40 years. We're asking for your help to make that happen.</p>
<p>We are Cheryl Richards and Adrian Noone. We literally grew up at the Sunlight Cafe - Sunday mornings munching on sesame waffles and Tuesday nights slurping down tahini dressing. We took over the business last year from Adrian's parents, Margaret &amp; Joe, who were part of the Sunlight's founding in 1976. </p>
<p>In March of next year, the Sunlight will move to NE 64th St. and 9th Ave NE - yep, it's just around the corner from our current spot. This new spot is roughly equal in size, inlcuding an outdoor patio, and we'll be customizing the space so it serves our staff better while also feeling warm and familiar to our regulars.</p>
<p>Your contributions will help build the new Sunlight Cafe. Each dollar you give will go straight toward either construction costs or equipment that will keep us grilling, sautéing, and chopping your favorite vegetarian comfort food. Think of it as a taste of old Seattle in the heart of new Seattle.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $75,000. Yeah, that's a lot of money, though it won't even cover a quarter of our build-out costs. What it will cover is the purchase of some pretty crucial equipment for our new space. Here are just a few of the items the money will go toward:</p>
<ul>
<li>$7,000-10,000 for a new dishwasher</li>
<li>$7,000-10,000 for a walk-in cooler</li>
<li>$30,000 for a range hood system</li>
</ul>
<p>Not to mention countertops, sinks, refrigeration, plumbing, electrical, restrooms, &amp;c...</p>
<p>Don't worry, your gift won't leave you empty-handed! To the right you can check out some of the nifty perks we've put together for everyone who donates.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We move into our new building in Spring of 2018, and our hope is to hit the ground running (or hit the kitchen cooking...). We love what we do and can't wait to be settled into our new space. We are working with the SBA to secure a small business loan. But building a restaurant is expensive! Construction costs are coming in much higher than we expected - and we are trying to find creative ways to bridge that gap. We could use a little push up this financial mountain. We can't wait until we are over the hump, settled into our new digs, and can focus on the food &amp; people!</p>
<p>The changes we've made over the years haven't changed the essence of who we are. And neither will this move change us at our core. We know how to cook and we know how to hustle - 40 years in the restaurant industry will teach you that. The money we raise won't be wasted; it will go toward nourishing our community one meal at a time</p>

<p></p>
<p><span>It is now evident that developing countries which invest in broadband infrastructure see dramatic results. Broadband is not only about economic gain.  A number of studies have shown how internet connectivity can improve lives in various other ways, such as enhancing health and education services, creating enhanced government services, and increasing productivity.  Mattru Jong is a typical town in Sierra Leone.  It has a population of ~ 10K and is facing the most vexing problems of illiteracy and youth unemployment.  The town does not have high-speed broadband access and there are no imminent plans to invest in a reliable internet infrastructure in the near future. Without a new out-of-the-box initiative that infuses new skills and ideas into the community, Mattru Jong, along with similar towns in Sierra Leone, will continue to face a bleak future</span></p>

The Mattru Jong Community Center was established in 2013 but had to close in 2014 due to the Ebola crisis.  Prior to closing, the Community Center generated revenues of $200 per day from charging cell phones, selling clean water, the snack bar, and the movie theater.  The second floor of the Community Center was not fully utilized and provides a large training room with space for 20 – 25 computers.  In addition to the available training room, the Community Center has available:

Solar power and electric installations

Ample ventilation

As a result, the existing Community Center provides an excellent foundation for the Computer Center.




Volunteer Activities to Support the Computer Center Project
The AYM staff and UN volunteers will provide the following services to support the Computer Center:

Curriculum Development:  Computer training curriculum to deliver sound and qualitative computer literacy education to the Mattru Jong’s youths. Taking into consideration the needs of the target groups including age, literacy, culture, religion and socio-economic background.  The team will fully take advantage of existing resources and programs that are available.

<h3>Hello and welcome! Thanks for stopping by!!</h3>
<p> Hola! As some of you already know, I've been making boas and costuming performers for over 8 years now. I took the plunge into self employment in 2012 and have had a great time with my burlesque career, now I'm ready to launch my costume business in a serious way, get this thing off the ground and create more incredibly fabulous things for creative people all over the world!! It's been my dream since I was a child to dance, entertain and create costumes...  I'm 2/3 of the way there, now I need a little help, and I'm asking you fabulous creatures to help me make that happen!! And I have some gorgeous things to exchange for your support!! Everyone's a winner!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The filthy details.</h3>
<p>  As a lot of you know, being self employed in the entertainment industry is not easy. We create, we rehearse, we share our craft and are lucky enough to get paid for doing what we love. Yay! However, when it comes to funding business ventures, the banks are loathe to touch self-employed people in such a precarious industry. Working part time and maintaining a career in the arts is hard, especially when the only things you've ever done (retail and bar work) require working weekends. I'm looking to raise £500 to pay for web space, hosting, product shots and of course the fabric in order to make up my samples. I've been making boas for the burlesque, drag and Rocky Horror communities for over 8 years now and would love to have the chance to expand my business into a professional entity which is ready to take over the very world with ruffly, spangly gorgeousness! YOU can help make my dream a reality!!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How you can help!!</h3>

 Hola! As some of you already know, I've been making boas and costuming performers for over 8 years now. I took the plunge into self employment in 2012 and have had a great time with my burlesque career, now I'm ready to launch my costume business in a serious way, get this thing off the ground and create more incredibly fabulous things for creative people all over the world!! It's been my dream since I was a child to dance, entertain and create costumes...  I'm 2/3 of the way there, now I need a little help, and I'm asking you fabulous creatures to help me make that happen!! And I have some gorgeous things to exchange for your support!! Everyone's a winner!
 
The filthy details.
  As a lot of you know, being self employed in the entertainment industry is not easy. We create, we rehearse, we share our craft and are lucky enough to get paid for doing what we love. Yay! However, when it comes to funding business ventures, the banks are loathe to touch self-employed people in such a precarious industry. Working part time and maintaining a career in the arts is hard, especially when the only things you've ever done (retail and bar work) require working weekends. I'm looking to raise £500 to pay for web space, hosting, product shots and of course the fabric in order to make up my samples. I've been making boas for the burlesque, drag and Rocky Horror communities for over 8 years now and would love to have the chance to expand my business into a professional entity which is ready to take over the very world with ruffly, spangly gorgeousness! YOU can help make my dream a reality!!
 


How you can help!!
Well, I have lots of things to sell and make for you!! If you ever wanted to own one of my boas, now is the chance!! I'm doing some special offers on Princess and Queen size boas, as well as taking general donations to my fund. I have everything in place.....web designer, photographer, models, designs, I just need the bunce to make it all happen.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p></p>
<p>My name is Harmony Knight, the creator and owner of ILoveMyFro, a natural hair care products and resource designed to inspire, educate and support women with natural hair. My Shea Butter Whips and Black Tea Leave-In Treatment are a favorite among many women in the natural hair community.</p>
<p>My 21 years of administrative and customer service experience obtained with working for companies such as, Citigroup, OpenLink Financial, The City of New York and MaGraw Hill Publishing company, along with my love and passion for natural hair prepared and inspired me to start ILoveMyFro.com in 2009.</p>
<p>Since 2011 I've been hosting annual summer events that celebrate as well as inspire women who are not yet comfortable with wearing their natural hair. I understand that for some naturals, the natural hair phenomena is just about hair, but for others, it's about finally looking in the mirror, and for the first time loving, appreciating and accepting themselves for who they naturally are!  </p>
<p>This campaign will enable me to take ILoveMyFro to a new level by purchasing supplies on a much larger scale to create bigger quantities of ILoveMyFro hair products in full and samples sizes for trade shows and subscription beauty boxes.</p>
<p>Your contribution will help me promote my business on a much larger scale so I can fulfill my long term goal by opening up the ILoveMyFro boutique in NYC. </p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;"">It is obviously important to me because buying the Lazer project was the biggest risk I have ever taken, and I now stand to lose everything.</span></p><p></p></span><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;"">But this is also important to the Formula Vee community because the Lazer has such a proud 30-year history in the class. The Lazer is raced successfully by drivers around the country and holds many records. Several people have contacted me in need of various parts for their Lazers and I haven’t been able to help them. Since I am the sole owner to the rights of the Lazer Formula Vee, I am the only person who can build one. This means that these thieves could be the end of the Lazer’s history and cause for the Formula Vee class losing one of its best cars.</span></p><p></p></span><p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;"">After years of working with cars and studying Mechanical Engineering, I believe I would have a great deal to offer as a builder and could bring fresh new ideas and innovations to the class.</span></p><p></p></span><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;"">Being a builder would put me in a great position to promote the Formula Vee class. Formula Vee really gave me direction in life, and I would like to share that experience with younger drivers and recruit new talent into the Formula Vee class and Engineering field.</span></p><p></p></span><p></p>

<p></p></span>
<p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;"">The reason I first started driving a Formula Vee 10 years ago was the cost. Formula Vee is a relatively inexpensive form of racing, which makes it a great class for those just starting in racing, those in school, those on a budget, or, well...anyone!</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;"">The reason that I have stayed in Formula Vee is the great sense of community within the class. The competition is amazing and, while the other drivers never make it easy to win, everyone ultimately just wants to see you succeed, and they’d do anything to help.</span></p><p></p></span><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;"">Formula Vee is the friendliest group of people I know, and I think it’s the greatest racing class in the world.</span></p><p></p><p></p>

<b><br/></b>
<p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;"">Not to be shallow, but many people say that the Lazer is the best looking Formula Vee on the market.</span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;"">That’s important to me because I’m an engineer and not a designer, so my expertise is optimizing the performance of systems and not their appearance. Having a nice, aesthetically pleasing foundation is a good start for me. It also makes the Lazer appealing to young and novice drivers, meaning I could use it to promote the class and recruit new drivers.</span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;"">However, the Lazer definitely is NOT all about looks. Attention has been paid to every aspect of the car, resulting in an all-around great car that holds many records and can win on any track. The Lazer is an aerodynamic, great handling, easily serviceable, and ergonomically-designed purpose-built racecar... put simply, the Lazer is functional and beautiful!</span></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;"">Luckily I still have the drawings for all of the Lazer’s components. I’ve been in contact with various suppliers and fabricators and am absolutely certain that rebuilding will be possible, but I can't do it alone! Especially not on a student's salary while I finish my Masters program. This $20,000 will allow me to begin rebuilding the jigs and molds necessary for building the chassis, suspension, and body components of the Lazer Formula Vee and save a piece of racing history.<br/></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;"">And that’s why I’m hoping that the kindness of others will help me raise funds on Indiegogo and fulfill my lifelong dream.</span><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;""> </span></p>

I invite you to be a part of this - both the fundraising campaign and the Lazer history itself. Please contribute today and help spread the word by sharing this campaign with your friends.
 

 
 
Why is this important?
It is obviously important to me because buying the Lazer project was the biggest risk I have ever taken, and I now stand to lose everything.
But this is also important to the Formula Vee community because the Lazer has such a proud 30-year history in the class. The Lazer is raced successfully by drivers around the country and holds many records. Several people have contacted me in need of various parts for their Lazers and I haven’t been able to help them. Since I am the sole owner to the rights of the Lazer Formula Vee, I am the only person who can build one. This means that these thieves could be the end of the Lazer’s history and cause for the Formula Vee class losing one of its best cars.
 
Why do I want to be a racecar builder?
After years of working with cars and studying Mechanical Engineering, I believe I would have a great deal to offer as a builder and could bring fresh new ideas and innovations to the class.
Being a builder would put me in a great position to promote the Formula Vee class. Formula Vee really gave me direction in life, and I would like to share that experience with younger drivers and recruit new talent into the Formula Vee class and Engineering field.
 
Why Formula Vee?

          


The reason I first started driving a Formula Vee 10 years ago was the cost. Formula Vee is a relatively inexpensive form of racing, which makes it a great class for those just starting in racing, those in school, those on a budget, or, well...anyone!
The reason that I have stayed in Formula Vee is the great sense of community within the class. The competition is amazing and, while the other drivers never make it easy to win, everyone ultimately just wants to see you succeed, and they’d do anything to help.
Formula Vee is the friendliest group of people I know, and I think it’s the greatest racing class in the world.
 
Why the Lazer?




Not to be shallow, but many people say that the Lazer is the best looking Formula Vee on the market.
That’s important to me because I’m an engineer and not a designer, so my expertise is optimizing the performance of systems and not their appearance. Having a nice, aesthetically pleasing foundation is a good start for me. It also makes the Lazer appealing to young and novice drivers, meaning I could use it to promote the class and recruit new drivers.
However, the Lazer definitely is NOT all about looks. Attention has been paid to every aspect of the car, resulting in an all-around great car that holds many records and can win on any track. The Lazer is an aerodynamic, great handling, easily serviceable, and ergonomically-designed purpose-built racecar... put simply, the Lazer is functional and beautiful!


 

What are my plans for the future?
Luckily I still have the drawings for all of the Lazer’s components. I’ve been in contact with various suppliers and fabricators and am absolutely certain that rebuilding will be possible, but I can't do it alone! Especially not on a student's salary while I finish my Masters program. This $20,000 will allow me to begin rebuilding the jigs and molds necessary for building the chassis, suspension, and body components of the Lazer Formula Vee and save a piece of racing history.
And that’s why I’m hoping that the kindness of others will help me raise funds on Indiegogo and fulfill my lifelong dream. 
I only have a limited time to raise these funds, so please help me and the Formula Vee community by contributing today and spread the word by sharing this campaign with your friends.
Thanks - and see you at the track.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>According to CNN the “U.S. jails its people at a rate 7 to 10 times higher than any other developed nation.” In fact, we house 1/4<sup>th</sup> of the world’s prisoners. My name is Barbara Rhode. I have been a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist for more than 20  years &amp; I started the Red Tent Women’s Initiative (Red Tent) at the Pinellas County Jail in St. Petersburg, Florida in  October of 2012.Our mission is to i<strong>mprove the lives of women, benefiting their families and communities through mentoring opportunities, financial empowerment and the social bonding that is the natural result of creating marketable crafts together in an atmosphere of trust and encouragement.</strong></p>
<p>About 10 years ago, I was asked to assist the staff in a local work release/court ordered drug treatment facility challenged by  the sudden increase in the number of female inmates. I ended up working there for 5 years; teaching life-skills, providing staff trainings and completing mental health assessments for the inmates. It was apparent that many of the women I met with showed signs of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) &amp; most of them were mothers. National statistics report that approximately 3.5% of the general population has PTSD. I started administering PTSD surveys to the clients &amp; I was shocked to see that 65% of the women in the work release center qualified for it. Most of them had never been treated &amp; their symptoms contributed to the downward cycle that landed them in jail in the first place. 10 million children in this country have a mom or dad who is behind bars. 10 million children living through the traumatic pain of parental separation &amp; oftentimes, having been tiny witnesses to their parent’s vicious cycle of substance abuse &amp; incarceration.</p>
<p> <strong>75% of the women</strong> incarcerated in jail or prison today have had to leave behind young children once sentenced and many of them have lost their parental rights. Statistics show that <strong>65-75% of their children</strong> will also be incarcerated someday. Upon release, these women have to beat almost insurmountable odds in order to provide food and shelter for their families or begin the battle to regain custody of their children. I am convinced that this vicious cycle directly affects all of us; our communities are weakened as family bonds are broken instead of healed and ex-offenders are left feeling forced to return to their self-destructive lifestyle when door after door closes to them.</p>
<p>For the past 10 months, Red Tent has served more than 130 women in the Pinellas County Jail by creating a safe, nurturing space  every Thursday &amp; Friday where women create meaningful art while attending workshops on important life skills such as anger management, codependency, addiction prevention &amp; mindfulness training. Under the guidance of a fabric artist &amp; classroom counselor, our participants learn valuable, life changing skills while creating crafts such as pillow shams &amp; prayer flags that are up-cycled from reclaimed jeans, tablecloths or other donations. Many of the women tell us that Red Tent is the only program they signed up for while in jail. Our class is one of the most popular programs for women at the jail &amp; we have a long waiting list to prove it.  </p>
<p>It is estimated that almost 50% of ex-offenders return to jail within the first 3 months of release. Of the 130 women Red Tent has served to date; <strong>less than 10% have been rearrested</strong>. We are having a lot of success in our program at the jail but we need your help to continue and build on these efforts. Red Tent is not a charity. Our goal, with your help, is to grow into a profit making business. Together, we will teach the women to take pride in the work created by their two hands &amp; make an honest profit from their labors instead of depending on others for charitable handouts.</p>
<h2>What We Need and What You Get</h2>
<p>I pay for all the costs of the Red Tent classes at the jail out of my own pocket. I really believe in this program and continually see the powerful effect it has had on so many of the women who have participated. I want to continue providing these services at the jail but I need your help. My original intent was that we would be a self-sustaining business, selling the crafts the women create at local farmers’ markets and through our website with 100% of the profits benefiting the women. I now understand that it will take us more time to create a system that generates enough funds for us to continue and even allows us to expand our services without relying on donations and competing for charitable contributions.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It will take a minimum of $ 17,700  to continue classes at the jail for another year. This will pay for the teacher, a classroom assistant/counselor, a very small part of the administrative costs and also allow us to buy some supplies that don’t typically get donated. I cannot afford to continue to pay all of the expenses myself. I believe Red Tent is a concept that deserves an opportunity to blossom into a self-sustaining business but I need your help in order to accomplish what we have set out to do.</p>

<p>Whatever funds we do receive will be used to pay for more classes at the jail. If we do not receive the full funding that we are requesting, we will use any &amp; all the money that is donated to provide these services for as long as we can. We are grateful for whatever you can do to help us continue to reach these women. I promise that we will do our best with what we are given.</p>
<h2>Impact:</h2>
<p>There are approximately 3,000 inmates in the Pinellas County Jail &amp; it costs taxpayers about $105 per day to house &amp; feed each of them. That’s $315,000 per day. It costs $10 per day for a Red Tent participant to attend our program. If 54% of the inmates released end up returning to jail within 3 months, approximately 70 of our participants would have been back behind bars if Red Tent was not providing services. ***Less than 10% of the 130 women we have served so far have been rearrested. That means we have saved this county over $5,985 per day in recidivism costs.</p>
<p>Pinellas County Jail is just 1 jail in 1 city but this same story is told over and over again, all over the country. By refusing to break apart this vicious cycle by providing ex-offenders viable options in order to become contributing members of society, we spend countless dollars that could have been used on more important things like our children’s education or healthcare services. By sitting by &amp; refusing to look at this problem &amp; become part of the solution, we are creating a third world country right here in the US. In the upcoming year, with your help, Red Tent can become a self-sufficient, successful business that could be a model for other jails in other cities.</p>
<p>While  working with the work release program, I had an opportunity to read ""The Tending Instinct,"" by Dr. Shellye Taylor which describes a socializing pattern of behavior in women that ""From an evolutionary standpoint ...is a plausible account of female responses to stress."" In her book, Dr. Taylor states that as social animals, women produce increased levels of oxytocin, a brain chemical that helps them feel safe &amp; secure, from spending time in the company of other women. Tending &amp; befriending includes the act of coming together to share stories, offer help, empathize &amp; create mentoring relationships. Dr. Taylor goes on to build the case that women are hardwired to need to connect with each other and  require ample opportunities to express and satisfy this instinctual urge.</p>
<p>Years of private practice have  shown me that modern society actually inhibits tending &amp; befriending through its obsession with safety, addiction to technology, competitive spirit and independent, individual lifestyles. Men &amp; women live, often isolated, behind locked doors raising children who grow up feeling the fear and feeling alone.</p>
<p>A few years later, someone suggested that I read Anita Daimant's novel, ""The Red Tent."" By then, I had incorporated Dr. Taylor's information into my workshops; teaching others that the need women often feel to talk through problems with loved ones or professionals was instinctual &amp; that satisfying this urge would ultimately benefit families and communities. Reading “The Red Tent” reinforced my belief that something needed to be done; preferably a grassroots effort to encourage and empower women to schedule in time spent in the company of other women. Daimant’s story, which is set during Biblical times, described a red tent where women could stay when ill, depressed, alone, grieving or afraid; a place where young &amp; old  could share stories, wisdom and compassion. Where is our red tent now?  What happened to a tradition that benefitted men, women &amp; children and brought about a sense of community &amp; togetherness?</p>
<p>Last year, this urge to start a red tent became more real for me.  Within minutes after walking into a neighbor’s house for an estate sale, I realized that something felt very odd; as if the owner of all this stuff had left one morning and never returned.  I asked another neighbor also shopping there if he knew the story behind this strange sale. He whispered that the woman who had lived there had killed herself recently &amp; that her daughter was sitting by the front door, managing the sale. It looked as if everything  of hers was for sale; the comb that still had some of her hair in it, her worn-out, well-loved teapot &amp; even a 1/2 bottle of her favorite perfume. I decided to leave but for some reason, I took a walk through her bedroom, maybe to try to get a better understanding of who she had been and why she had taken her own life. There on her nightstand was a copy of ""The Red Tent.""</p>
<p>Her book now sits on my office shelf; reminding me that this woman might have made a different choice if there had been a red tent to go to when the world closed in on her. Since that day, I have worked to provide women with a place to come together; my own small attempt at creating a red tent where women can reach out for help, share stories and mentor the young &amp; in need. A safe place where women can come together to tend &amp; befriend.</p>
<p>The class we currently provide at the jail is the first step in creating a Red Tent space for women in this area. I chose to reach out first to incarcerated women after watching the challenges they &amp; their children face on a daily basis. Florida is #2 on the list of unchecked prisoner population growth. The women who graduate out of our classes are keeping in touch with us &amp; many of them attend the Monday support group I offer in my private practice office. We hear over &amp; over again that Red Tent made it possible for them to make better, wiser choices after release; just knowing that there are people in the community that care for many has been enough to keep them out of jail.</p>
<p>With your help, we will be able to continue providing classes at the jail 2 days per week while we focus on establishing a community drop in center for any woman, not just ex-offenders, to participate in. Please help us make a difference. Their stories &amp; challenges affect all of us, even when you pretend not to notice them. They are your neighbors, your sisters, your daughters &amp; you…..</p>

together while chasing our love of music thru the years.Running a hifi shop is by no means a get rich proposition, it is a labor of 
love and every contribution, no matter how small, will make sure that Audio Vision SF stays in San Francisco and continues to bring the joy of music to our patrons. BIG NEWS ! We have found a space and will be relocating to 1628 California Street! That's only 1.5 blocks away! It is an empty shell..So now we need your support to build out this space to better serve you in the future.What We Need & What You GetWe have a goal of $50,000, every penny of which will go to the relocation and interior construction of our new home in SF.  And if we don't reach our goal, the funds received will still go to our relocation fund, NOTHING goes into our pockets!We also have at least a dozen audio manufacturers who are contributing some really exciting products to our effort.The ImpactAs many of you know, hifi shops are not located on every corner.  Retail (brick & motor) stores are an essential and declining part of experiencing 
something as personal as choosing a hifi system.  Deciding on a music playback system, or a new part 
to add to your current system, is like deciding on a favorite beer or wine. The majority taste good, but only a few will have that distinctive flavor 
that you prefer.  You can’t hear what a particular pair of speakers sounds like on line, nor can you tell how that pair of speakers sounds with a 
particular amplifier or source.  These are things that you need to figure out for yourself and 
to do that, you need a place with the expertise to guide you on your journey and the 
product selection to make sure that you arrive at your destination.  With your help, our decades old shop can continue to help people enjoy the music.Other Ways You Can HelpEvery little bit helps!  If you can't contribute monetarily, please use the Indiegogo Share Tools to pass the word on to friends, family, co-workers, cyborgs or any Wookies that you may know!  Thank you for reading this and taking an interest in Audio Vision SF!AND OF COURSE IF YOU CAN PLEASE TAKE A MINUTE FILL OUT OUR SIMPLE QUESTIONNAIRE!   https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1O3d0kOHZqpB1wAzFAAjv_WdHRSKZQg6fkLSQp2PkZiI/viewform ..",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Hayden, and I've created The Quality
Alternative. And with your generous donation, we can help bring back American
manufacturing jobs all across the United States, from sea to shining sea.<p></p><p></p>
<ul>
<li>The Quality Alternative is an
     internet-based retail business that is strictly going to sell quality
     American-made merchandise from a wide selection of useful, interesting,
     and fun products, with a passion for customer satisfaction, and a true
     dedication to helping less fortunate Americans in need. Imagine a store
     that carries gadgets, tools, toys, electronics, games, musical
     instruments, sporting goods, pet supplies, furniture, decor, clothing
     &amp; accessories, collectibles, memorabilia, etcetera … and they’re ALL
     made right here in the United States! Imagine the impact this could have
     on our economy!<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>We’re also going to offer a TRUE
     customer satisfaction guarantee- Where if your order is not as described,
     or is of poor quality, we’ll simply refund the full product price within
     the stated time frame (excludes shipping, handling, and tax, of course).
     And for returns, you’ll have at least 30 days from the day you <b>receive</b>
     your package, <b>not </b>from the day we ship it. We feel that a customer
     won’t be truly satisfied until the day they receive their order and is
     able to verify it’s how it should be. And we’ll always make sure that our
     products are of respectable quality. So, if we consistently have problems
     with a certain product or manufacturer, and the issue is not resolved when
     brought to their attention in a timely manner, we’ll simply remove that
     product or manufacturer from our product line, because maintaining quality
     control throughout The Quality Alternative is more important to me than
     big profit margins for selling cheap junk.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>And finally, no matter what you buy or
     how much you spend, we will <b>ALWAYS </b>donate at least <b>TWENTY FIVE
     PERCENT</b> of our gross profits from <b>EVERY SINGLE PURCHASE</b> toward
     the qualified charity of the customer’s choice during order check-out.
     This offer has no time limit and will always be available. You won't pay
     anything extra, but you will get to choose where one-fourth of our profits
     go! In fact, you don’t have to pick just one charity to donate to. You can
     pick as many as you want, and the donation gets divided up by the number
     of charities you picked. And we also give you the option to donate directly
     to your local chapters of each charity based on whichever zip code you
     provide us.</li>

</li>
<li><b>Must not be guilty of any

</ul><hr/><p>Now, in order to do all of
this, I do need time and money. I currently spend over 80 hours a week between
work and commuting, which leaves just a tiny bit of time to help raise my
family each night. It also leaves almost no time to work towards this goal. </p>
<p><b><u>So, here are my plans for the funds that are

<p>I will use the necessary
portion of the funds raised for operating costs such as facilities rent,
internet, phone, fax, shipping supplies, web hosting, purchasing inventory, and
other utilities or services required to operate my business. </p>
<p>I will also be applying funds
toward marketing and ad production costs such as radio advertisements, print
advertisements, billboards, social media and other internet marketing, and then
release some video advertisements, giving top priority to the people that
purchased one of our campaign perks. I really want to get creative with this!</p>
<p>Also included will be the
initial production costs of designing the website, writing content, and any
other one-time production assistance required to get The Quality Alternative
going live and taking orders!</p>
<p>So, I am humbly requesting at
least $25,000 to cover the costs for at least 6 months of operation. At that
point, we will have enough revenue to cover our own costs, and can continue to
provide support to these quality American manufacturers, as well as the
charities that deserve it the most. </p>

Our primary job there was working with elementary aged children and I will never forget how sweet and loving these children were who had almost nothing in terms of material possessions.   <br/>      Seeing the news coming in with the devastation that Typhoon Haiyan did to the Philippines is simply heart breaking.  With an estimated 10,000 people dead and another 630,000 est left homeless by one of the biggest storms in history the path to recovery can only be long and difficult.  We at Athena's Wink are doing this fundraiser to try and help the people of the Philippines in any way that we can. We got other artists to chip in additional items to expand the effort.  Every donated dollar helps.  The funds raised will be donated to the Philippine Red Cross.  <br/>      We chose the Tarsier as the mascot for this project as it is a very unique and adorable animal that  is native to the Philippines and can translate easily into a variety of products.  I hope you like what we have made and above all I hope you donate! </p>Who we are: <br/><br/>Athena's Wink is an established company with a presence on Etsy, Amazon, Ebay and ThinkGeek.  The owners Carrie Wink and Carolann Voltarel are two crafters from Brooklyn who make cute hats, flasks and other items and sell them online and at conventions around the US.  They have done fundraising efforts in the past for the Red Cross for the Japanese earthquake and Hurricane Sandy.

Our primary job there was working with elementary aged children and I will never forget how sweet and loving these children were who had almost nothing in terms of material possessions.         Seeing the news coming in with the devastation that Typhoon Haiyan did to the Philippines is simply heart breaking.  With an estimated 10,000 people dead and another 630,000 est left homeless by one of the biggest storms in history the path to recovery can only be long and difficult.  We at Athena's Wink are doing this fundraiser to try and help the people of the Philippines in any way that we can. We got other artists to chip in additional items to expand the effort.  Every donated dollar helps.  The funds raised will be donated to the Philippine Red Cross.        We chose the Tarsier as the mascot for this project as it is a very unique and adorable animal that  is native to the Philippines and can translate easily into a variety of products.  I hope you like what we have made and above all I hope you donate! Who we are: Athena's Wink is an established company with a presence on Etsy, Amazon, Ebay and ThinkGeek.  The owners Carrie Wink and Carolann Voltarel are two crafters from Brooklyn who make cute hats, flasks and other items and sell them online and at conventions around the US.  They have done fundraising efforts in the past for the Red Cross for the Japanese earthquake and Hurricane Sandy. They have also raised over 1k for Child's Play.  https://www.etsy.com/shop/athenaswinkHikari wo Sagasu's mission to make everyone shine in

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 15.0pt;""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman';"">It's always been a dream of mine
to coach youth soccer.  My first week working in the pediatric ward at
""Hopital Albert Schweitzer"" in Lambarene, Gabon, I played pick up
soccer with some of the local teenage boys.   As we wrapped up, I offered
to start coaching them starting the next week.  From then on, when I
wasn't busy taking care of sick children, I gave my heart and soul to these
young men.  It started with 11 boys during the first practice but then
quickly grew to over 40 players and an assistant coach.  We started with
weekend scrimmage games but soon traveled to play other local teams.  Through
activities on and off the field, I became part of these young men's lives,
homes, and community.  I was incredibly happy.  </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 15.0pt;""><span style='font-family: ""Times New Roman"";'>Before
leaving Lambarene, I found a Gabonese coach to take over the team and I signed
them up for a tournament. Now that I'm back in the US, I want to stay involved
and give these children hope for a professional soccer career.</span><span style='font-family: ""Times New Roman""; color: #2A2A2A;'></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 15.0pt;""><span style='font-family: ""Times New Roman"";'>My
fundraising goal is to purchase all the necessary soccer accessories for this
team to progress.  As you can see in the video, we had to be creative.  Many
boys didn't have athletic shoes, there was no goal net, no cones, and we went
through over 10 soccer balls in just 3 months. Because coaching is a major time
commitment and a consistent leader is an absolute necessity for the team, these
funds will also provide a coaching stipend to ensure the team continues year
after year. </span><span style='font-family: ""Times New Roman""; color: #2A2A2A;'></span></p>

</div></div>","It's always been a dream of mine
to coach youth soccer.  My first week working in the pediatric ward at
""Hopital Albert Schweitzer"" in Lambarene, Gabon, I played pick up
soccer with some of the local teenage boys.   As we wrapped up, I offered
to start coaching them starting the next week.  From then on, when I
wasn't busy taking care of sick children, I gave my heart and soul to these
young men.  It started with 11 boys during the first practice but then
quickly grew to over 40 players and an assistant coach.  We started with
weekend scrimmage games but soon traveled to play other local teams.  Through
activities on and off the field, I became part of these young men's lives,
homes, and community.  I was incredibly happy.  
Before
leaving Lambarene, I found a Gabonese coach to take over the team and I signed
them up for a tournament. Now that I'm back in the US, I want to stay involved
and give these children hope for a professional soccer career.
My
fundraising goal is to purchase all the necessary soccer accessories for this
team to progress.  As you can see in the video, we had to be creative.  Many
boys didn't have athletic shoes, there was no goal net, no cones, and we went
through over 10 soccer balls in just 3 months. Because coaching is a major time
commitment and a consistent leader is an absolute necessity for the team, these
funds will also provide a coaching stipend to ensure the team continues year
after year. 
What The Team Needs 
1) 10 soccer balls 
2) 20 soccer bibs
3) 24 water bottles
4) 2 official size soccer nets 
5) Soccer ball pump + needles 
6) 24 Plastic Disk Cones
7) Soccer cleats ~20 pairs
8) 2 small sided soccer nets 
9) Coach Stipend  
10) Equipment Shipping costs
Note: If
the entire goal is not reached, the money will be used for the most essential
items on the list above. 
The Impact
Most of us are fortunate to know how being a part of a team impacts us.  It
teaches us how to work together, work hard, build confidence, discipline and
sportsmanship.  This soccer team may be the only way for these young men
to experience that.  Furthermore, the team impacts the younger kids who
watch in anticipation of playing in the future, and the families and community
members who come together to cheer them on.

They often have few, if any, happy memories of childhood and hosting provides a respite from life in an orphanage, an opportunity to create positive and memorable childhood experiences, an opportunity to travel to a new place, medical, dental and vision care, a chance to eat healthy food, a chance to live in a family setting (some for the first time ever!), a chance to see appropriately modeled relationships, a chance to gain exposure and meet caring people in a country where they might have a chance of being adopted, and a chance to learn English which gives them yet another skill set to help overcome the overwhelming inequality and prejudice they face as orphans in their countries.</p><p>Children who live in orphanages own nothing as most of the orphanages all share community property. This means that even if you go to adopt a child there you have to bring them a change of clothes because nothing is allowed to go with them or leave the property. For many orphans, they have not yet learned that their society looks down on them to the point that they are excluded from many careers such as being a police officer, lawyer, teacher or doing much more than building trades despite their hard work, academic excellence and potential. In these countries, orphans over 9 years old, ones that are part of a sibling set, or ones with any type of mental, physical or learning disability are all considered lost causes and chances are slim to none that they will ever find a family in their own country. Instead they will be forced out of the system at 16 and go straight to work in an attempt to support themselves any way they can. </p><p>Project 143 tries to change that by advertising these great kids to potential host families in the United States. In some instances the host families fall in love and choose to adopt their host child. In situations where that is not a possibility or not desired by either party, the host family can still act as an adoption advocate and try to find a loving adoptive home for the child here in the US where their many talents can be utilized and developed despite their orphan upbringing and status in their home country.

He has lived in the orphanage since he was 5 years old and has a 20 year old sister who was also there at one point, but they have had no contact since she left a few years ago. His bio reads that he is thoughtful, introspective, gentle and caring. He loves animals, swimming, tennis and volleyball and dreams of riding horses if he is chosen to come to the US.

</h3>It all started when a teenage neighbor next door asked me for a lift to a skatepark one town over. ""I'm too busy today"", I told him. ""I wish we had a skatepark, he said."" Fast forward one city council meeting later, and I was ""all-in"" when another kid said before the council, ""[We'd like a skatepark.] We're not bad kids."" No, they aren't bad kids, and why is it we make them feel this way? They're good kids with a passion for skateboarding. Our city spends money on soccer, basketball, baseball, and many other legitimate sports, why not skateboarding? Skateboarding is cheaper, and cities have <a href=""https://www.nclm.org/SiteCollectionDocuments/RiskManagement/Skateboard%20Park%20INFO.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">liability protection</a> against injuries! Skating teens are worthy of our public dollars.<br/><br/>My name is Angela, but my friends call me ""Ange."" I'm a Newark, CA resident, and a mother of a 4-year old son. I'm a technical writer by profession. My friends tell me that I'm highly organized and a shrewd business woman. I am starting a nonprofit, Newark Parks Foundation—to meet a community need, serving as the Foundation's volunteer Executive Director.<br/><br/>Newark's total population under 18 in 2013-2014 was 25.4%. The city and the 
school district expects the number of families to increase as a result 
of the city’s new housing developments (2,500+ homes) currently scheduled for 
construction, yet no new parks are scheduled for construction, investments in existing parks are unsubstantial, and deferred park maintenance is at an all-time high.<br/><br/>My community needs more urban parks and open spaces to meet our growing outdoor recreational needs and desire for gathering places, and I want to do something about it. I want to harness the grass roots volunteers and leaders that I've already mobilized. My team and I have <a href=""https://newarkparks.wordpress.com/projects-programs/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">projects</a> in the planning stage, including:<br/><br/><div>
<ul><li>City's <i>first</i> <b><a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/ikt9ul78mxmyn6v/FlyerSkatePark.pdf?dl=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">skatepark</a></b> for teens and pre-teens. Teens
need safe places to socialize. Skateboarding fosters confidence, resilience,

It all started when a teenage neighbor next door asked me for a lift to a skatepark one town over. ""I'm too busy today"", I told him. ""I wish we had a skatepark, he said."" Fast forward one city council meeting later, and I was ""all-in"" when another kid said before the council, ""[We'd like a skatepark.] We're not bad kids."" No, they aren't bad kids, and why is it we make them feel this way? They're good kids with a passion for skateboarding. Our city spends money on soccer, basketball, baseball, and many other legitimate sports, why not skateboarding? Skateboarding is cheaper, and cities have liability protection against injuries! Skating teens are worthy of our public dollars.My name is Angela, but my friends call me ""Ange."" I'm a Newark, CA resident, and a mother of a 4-year old son. I'm a technical writer by profession. My friends tell me that I'm highly organized and a shrewd business woman. I am starting a nonprofit, Newark Parks Foundation—to meet a community need, serving as the Foundation's volunteer Executive Director.Newark's total population under 18 in 2013-2014 was 25.4%. The city and the 
school district expects the number of families to increase as a result 
of the city’s new housing developments (2,500+ homes) currently scheduled for 
construction, yet no new parks are scheduled for construction, investments in existing parks are unsubstantial, and deferred park maintenance is at an all-time high.My community needs more urban parks and open spaces to meet our growing outdoor recreational needs and desire for gathering places, and I want to do something about it. I want to harness the grass roots volunteers and leaders that I've already mobilized. My team and I have projects in the planning stage, including:
City's first skatepark for teens and pre-teens. Teens
need safe places to socialize. Skateboarding fosters confidence, resilience,
and independence. We've identified a couple of neighborhood parks with space for a skatepark!

City's first native plants garden (""demonstration garden"") for all to enjoy. The proposed site is a neighborhood park that serves at-risk youth and seniors. The park is adjacent to Head Start and a Senior Center. We already have a commitment from SF Don Edwards Wildlife Refuge's Native Plants Nursery to donate the native plants!

Tri-City Area's first dirt-jump pump-track bike park. This is a popular sport among mountain bikers and BMX bikers of all ages, and it's a family sport that brings people together from our neighboring communities and generates economic activity for our city. We've already identified volunteer dirt track shapers/builders!

City's first off-leash dog park. For many residents, their
 pets are part of their outdoor experience, especially for dog owners 
who have limited mobility. We have the public land!
To successfully deploy these projects, my team and I need to start up a nonprofit organization to acquire the necessary legal structure and status. Our Cause & Case

According to California Department of Education data for 2013-2014 
school year, the health risk of Newark’s teens is more than double and 
sometimes triple than that of Fremont’s, Newark’s neighboring city.

<p><b>It's Time to Expand</b></p>
<p>We've learned many things over the last few years. Being a completely mobile business, driving from place to place and promoting each event on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/thegingerarmadillo/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/thegingerdillo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> has worked very well for us (we doubled our revenue from 2014 to 2015). </p>
<p>The question we get all the time is ""Where are you normally located?"" We've realized that we're at the maximum for our mobile capacity, so it's time to open a stationary location. Not only will a stationary truck increase our purchases from our farming neighbors and allow us to employ more people, but instead of having to wait for us to come to you, you can come and eat with us on a regular basis. </p>
<p>Our philosophy works because the goal of our business is to reinvest into our community. But that continual reinvestment limits our ability to spend the kind of large one-time capital that expansions depend on. That's why we're running this campaign.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><b>The New Truck</b></p>
<p>Here's our canvas. We have some pretty exciting ideas for the exterior design. Finding the truck is always a challenging step, so we're pleased to have already passed that hurdle. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454546319/mfkdrluavovi4c9af55n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>We're excited about getting it up and cooking! This is what we need to do.<ul>
</ul>
<p><b>What We Need</b></p>
<p>The truck needs to be remodeled on the outside and have a standards-compliant kitchen installed on the inside. Here is some of what that entails:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>The interior of the truck must be lined with a fire resistant material (for obvious reasons), plus a new floor, and a window cut out for service.<br/>
</li>
<li>We'll need a new fryer, char grill, freezer, and reach-in fridge. That's just the appliances. We'll also need to build counters and storage cabinets.</li>
<li>For sanitation, Austin requires a three-compartment sink,  extensive plumbing, and waste-water disposal system. It's a good thing.</li>
<li>A vent-a-hood is required to get smoke out, and an air-conditioner is required to prevent everyone from turning into puddles in August.</li>
<li>We're going to install all new metal siding - we plan on leaving the new sheet metal exterior exposed. We're also working on a design to have the roof shaped into a covered wagon. Think of it as airstream meets chuck wagon. Something like this:                                                                               <span style=""background-color: initial;"">                                                                                            </span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454547115/uyxz4zs8mxgv9vlcs6bb.jpg"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; width: 339.126px; height: 248px; background-color: initial;""/>
</li>
<li><p>This new truck will need all new inspections and permits, because the city of Austin needs to sustain the lavish lifestyles of its bureaucrats somehow. </p></li>
<li><p>Plus all the inevitable pitfalls and setbacks waiting for us along the way.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><b>What We Will Do For You</b></p>
<p>Our perks section reflects our philosophy. We think of this campaign as an opportunity to have more people join our food community; which means making it easier for y'all to eat our food. Your donation will be rewarded with vouchers to be exchanged for Ginger Armadillo food, and they'll be good at either our future stationary or current mobile location. So as soon as the campaign ends, you can redeem your vouchers before our stationary location is even up and running. Just go to our on-line <a href=""http://thegingerarmadillo.com/locate"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">calendar</a> and track us down! We'll be waiting for you!</p>

We've learned many things over the last few years. Being a completely mobile business, driving from place to place and promoting each event on Facebook and Twitter has worked very well for us (we doubled our revenue from 2014 to 2015). 
The question we get all the time is ""Where are you normally located?"" We've realized that we're at the maximum for our mobile capacity, so it's time to open a stationary location. Not only will a stationary truck increase our purchases from our farming neighbors and allow us to employ more people, but instead of having to wait for us to come to you, you can come and eat with us on a regular basis. 
Our philosophy works because the goal of our business is to reinvest into our community. But that continual reinvestment limits our ability to spend the kind of large one-time capital that expansions depend on. That's why we're running this campaign.


The New Truck
Here's our canvas. We have some pretty exciting ideas for the exterior design. Finding the truck is always a challenging step, so we're pleased to have already passed that hurdle. 

We're excited about getting it up and cooking! This is what we need to do.

What We Need
The truck needs to be remodeled on the outside and have a standards-compliant kitchen installed on the inside. Here is some of what that entails:


The interior of the truck must be lined with a fire resistant material (for obvious reasons), plus a new floor, and a window cut out for service.

We'll need a new fryer, char grill, freezer, and reach-in fridge. That's just the appliances. We'll also need to build counters and storage cabinets.
For sanitation, Austin requires a three-compartment sink,  extensive plumbing, and waste-water disposal system. It's a good thing.
A vent-a-hood is required to get smoke out, and an air-conditioner is required to prevent everyone from turning into puddles in August.
We're going to install all new metal siding - we plan on leaving the new sheet metal exterior exposed. We're also working on a design to have the roof shaped into a covered wagon. Think of it as airstream meets chuck wagon. Something like this:                                                                                                                                                                           

This new truck will need all new inspections and permits, because the city of Austin needs to sustain the lavish lifestyles of its bureaucrats somehow. 
Plus all the inevitable pitfalls and setbacks waiting for us along the way.



What We Will Do For You
Our perks section reflects our philosophy. We think of this campaign as an opportunity to have more people join our food community; which means making it easier for y'all to eat our food. Your donation will be rewarded with vouchers to be exchanged for Ginger Armadillo food, and they'll be good at either our future stationary or current mobile location. So as soon as the campaign ends, you can redeem your vouchers before our stationary location is even up and running. Just go to our on-line calendar and track us down! We'll be waiting for you!


We'll also being offering traditional merchandise like T shirts and bumper stickers so you can spread the good news and tell people that you are keeping central Texas cuisine alive in Austin.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>My name is Stewart Thompson. Living here in Orange County, California, I have noticed that there are no actual personal training gyms in the whole county that focus on the wellness and well being of those who have suffered a Spinal Cord Injury and are left in a wheelchair. I myself have had an ""SCI"" for 3 years now and having to travel all over for treatment, San Diego, Brea, Huntington Beach, Etc. My wife and I thought, ""Why not have it all in one location?"" </p>
<p>This is exactly what we have decided to do. We started a Non-Profit company right here in Irvine, the business heart of the county, where there are 65,000 disabled people in all of Orange county and have already contracted a Acupressure professional, and three Acupuncturist who will work out of our gym with us. We have contracted with a Chiropractor and have several personal trainers who are very well trained in the field of ""SCI"" and are confident, that with all these things combined, all of our clients, including myself, will be able to get back something that we lost, maybe even Walking!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are asking for a minimum of $5,000, however, could certainly use much more:</p>
<p></p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>We need this to fund our cause and Start-Out</li>
<li>This will be used to lease a space and get things operational</li>
<li>It will also be used to help start a local fundraiser to raise more money</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>When people are thrown into this new lifestyle, like I was, it is extremely hard to adjust and know exactly what to do next:</p> <ul>
<li>We will be the choice for these new ones to come and understand that movement is going to be the best option possible!</li> <li>We have a highly trained and extremely skilled staff at each clients disposal.</li> <li>And with a combination of Personal Training, Acupuncture, Acupressure and Chiropractic care, we are sure to see major results, and major life changes.</li> </ul>

</div> <p>Thank you!</p></div>","Short Summary My name is Stewart Thompson. Living here in Orange County, California, I have noticed that there are no actual personal training gyms in the whole county that focus on the wellness and well being of those who have suffered a Spinal Cord Injury and are left in a wheelchair. I myself have had an ""SCI"" for 3 years now and having to travel all over for treatment, San Diego, Brea, Huntington Beach, Etc. My wife and I thought, ""Why not have it all in one location?"" 
This is exactly what we have decided to do. We started a Non-Profit company right here in Irvine, the business heart of the county, where there are 65,000 disabled people in all of Orange county and have already contracted a Acupressure professional, and three Acupuncturist who will work out of our gym with us. We have contracted with a Chiropractor and have several personal trainers who are very well trained in the field of ""SCI"" and are confident, that with all these things combined, all of our clients, including myself, will be able to get back something that we lost, maybe even Walking!   What We Need & What You Get We are asking for a minimum of $5,000, however, could certainly use much more:



We need this to fund our cause and Start-Out
This will be used to lease a space and get things operational
It will also be used to help start a local fundraiser to raise more money





  The Impact When people are thrown into this new lifestyle, like I was, it is extremely hard to adjust and know exactly what to do next: 
We will be the choice for these new ones to come and understand that movement is going to be the best option possible! We have a highly trained and extremely skilled staff at each clients disposal. And with a combination of Personal Training, Acupuncture, Acupressure and Chiropractic care, we are sure to see major results, and major life changes. 
  Risks & Challenges  The major risk involved here is not getting enough to start up our company and losing out on bettering these peoples lives. And too, another risk is that it is too costly for the individual client to pay for: 
We don't want to miss out on this opportunity to change peoples lives and really help the community. 
We want to really give people like me a fighting chance at recovery, something that doctors can't even do.  When a client can't pay, as a Non-Profit, we cannot carry a profit at the end of each year, so we are planing on being able to gift one or more clients $5,000-$10,000 to use at our facility as a gift to the client. 
  Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help: 
We would love to have more help in funding and hope that you would feel moved to assist through getting the word out via Facebook or whatever means And you can always contact us and visit our website LetsWalkINC.com

<p>The crowdfunding guide says I should type a short summation
of my story. That’s a hard thing to do when any amount of words is already not
enough to describe what my son and I are going through. Have you ever noticed-
in the middle of some personal tragedy- that the words in our language really
can’t describe much of what we go through? Well, hopefully this is short: There
was love, and then there was a baby. Things were very sweet, or so I thought,
and then I found out that when my love was visiting an old college friend in
San Diego he was actually visiting a girl. We tried to work it out. We went to counseling.
I became one of those girls you lose respect for- the ones who try to save the
relationship at all costs, the ones who love when all hope is gone. </p>
<p>Then, he walked out. Literally. He said he had tried to love
me, but he couldn’t. He said he wanted to love me, but he didn’t. Then he
walked out the door and got in his car, but he didn’t go anywhere. He started
sleeping in his car every night. Sometimes at night I would sneak downstairs to
see what he was doing. He was just sitting in his car, drinking beer and
watching movies. In the morning, he would come in and loom over us while we
slept. I often woke up to find him standing over me in a towel, fresh from his
shower, just standing there, staring. At first, I thought that he didn’t really
want to leave us and I felt hopeful we would work it out. As the weeks passed,
I started to get scared. Often, after work, he would let himself in with his
key and come in and sit down as if nothing had ever happened. A few times, he
even asked “What’s for dinner?” He was always cheerful and happy, as if
everything was going great. I started to feel uneasy that he didn’t understand
boundaries. Then, he told me his “grand plan”. I was allowed to go back to work
part time, either in Target or at a flower shop (extremely weird considering I
have two postgraduate degrees and we met at work). We were going to get either
adjoining apartments or houses on the same street. We would spend many evenings
together having dinner and playing with our son. In two years, we would move
together either to Colorado or Texas, whatever he decided was better for his
career. Hopefully, in the meantime, we would both meet someone we would actually
love. I tried to explain how weird this plan was, and how he didn’t understand
what breaking up meant. He refused to listen to any of it. He was downright
chipper about the entire thing. To me, it sounded like he had completely lost
his mind. When I told him that I felt very uncomfortable having him around so
much, he told me that when he came to visit our son, I had to leave. The next
time he came over he did, in fact, make me leave my own house so he could spend
time with our son alone. My son, who is almost two, completely stopped talking
during this time. I believe he was traumatized by the situation, and I was very
worried he was regressing in his development. </p>
<p>I was offered a job by my old boss, and I took it. It was in
Virginia, but I felt the distance would be good. At this point, I felt like my
X was delusional, scary, and possibly dangerous. I packed the baby up, left
most of our possessions for my X, and took off. I told him I was leaving the
day that I left, but not before. My X was furious. He didn’t want me to work
full time, because he didn’t want a “Juanita” to raise our baby. He wanted me
to stay in California, so he could continue with his career unimpeded. He
wanted us to all see each other almost every day- to spend all our time together,
although he would be free to explore other women and other relationships. I
refused to come back, and started my new job. </p>
<p>Although he was angry, he said if I found a lawyer and paid
for custody papers to be drawn up, he would sign them. So I did. I found a
lawyer in Virginia and had papers drawn up that offered him three days visitation
a week and joint custody, provided he moved. I didn’t even ask for child
support. He came to visit our son on the weekend and he took the papers home
with him to look them over. The Monday after he left I was served. He had
secretly retained a lawyer in California and filed for sole custody, with no
visitation rights for me at all. He additionally asked that I be investigated
for kidnapping, and further, he asked that our <b>son be put in foster care while the court granted him sole custody</b>. He stated that he had no idea where I was that and I was
holding our son hostage, even though he had just left from visiting us. He
asked that I pay his lawyer fees. He also included many personal details in his
filing (I assume just to upset and shame me) about how he had never found me
attractive after I had the baby because of my babyweight and nursing. About a month later- this past weekend, his
lawyer sent me more papers, asking for a record of all my financial holdings
since 2012. Long story short, he wants the apartment I bought before I ever met
him. He wants to be reimbursed for the money he spent during our relationship. He
wants half of anything I got for Christmas, for birthdays, everything. Even
though I had already paid for a lawyer here in Virginia, I have now had to retain
lawyers in Orange County, where he filed, to fight him in that jurisdiction. I have to fly out to California for the court date, missing work (and I haven't earned any paid time off yet) pay for a plane ticket, leave my son with my parents, and hope that I'm not held in California for future court proceedings. My X is not giving me any kind of normal child support. At first, he agreed to pay $100 a week, but for example this week he decided to give me $93, for no reason I can discover, and then he deducted the cost of Netflix from my payment (which he watches on the Wii I bought but left for him in our old apartment in California) so I ended up with a little less than $70. His goal is to completely destroy me and make it so I'm unable to raise our son.<br/></p>
<p>I didn’t work after our son was born. I thought I was lucky
to be a stay at home mom, but I gave up all my financial independence to care
for the family. This is my first job in almost three years. I paid a full
retainer for a lawyer in my new state of residence. I’ve only had one paycheck
so far and I have two months of unpaid bills. I have had to retain a second
lawyer in California because that is where my X filed his suit. I was only able
to pay part of their retainer because my financial situation is so dire. I only
need the last $2,000. I’ve never done a crowdfunding request before, but I’m so
afraid of losing my son, my new job and our only means of support, and now my old
apartment which being sold because I can’t afford the mortgage in my new
situation. Please help me to make a stable, normal space for my precious little
one. Even though I’m dealing with heartache, harassment and constant fear and
stress, my goal is to provide a bubble for him so he doesn’t know anything is
happening and he can exist, and grow and thrive in the eye of the storm. I need
the lawyers to help me fight against my X’s weird, innapropriate and cruel
requests, so I can focus on the best thing that’s ever happened to me, my
little boy. In America, ‘right’ is only who has the best lawyers and ‘wrong’ is
who couldn’t afford them. He has never had anyone stand up to him before, and frankly, he's just an angry and thoroughly selfish person without morals or remorse. I need to try and stand up to him, and keep my beautiful and innocent son safe. <br/></p>

The Cash Stash is a community-driven scavenger hunt dedicated to promoting the stories of animals in need of adoption at local animal shelters. By contributing to this campaign, you will help us to bring this fun and actionable event around the country, and ultimately help local shelter animals find their forever homes! (Note: If you are participating in this Saturday's (11/8) Cash Stash event in Nashua, sign up for email alerts here).

How it Works
We’ll be hiding cash in cities all across the east coast of the United States. When people find this cash, they’ll also find the picture and story of a shelter animal currently up for adoption. 
         
When someone finds the picture of a shelter animal and shares it on Facebook, VidFall makes a matching donation to the local shelter where the animal lives!

                                 
Our Goal - 
Get as many animals adopted as we can!


The donations provided through this campaign will allow us to take the event to bigger cities and help a much larger number of animals get adopted. As winter approaches, it’s important to help the strays who may not make it through the cold. 
Here’s our list of cities, and we’ll be adding new cities if we reach our $10,000 goal!



Manchester, NH - September 18th, 2014 - SUCCESS!


Nashua, NH - November 8th, 2014 ($1,000 Raised) SUCCESS!


Boston, MA - Spring, 2015 ($2,500 Raised)


Baltimore, MD - Spring, 2015 ($3,500 Raised)


Manchester, NH - Spring, 2015 ($6,000 Raised)


New York City, NY - Spring, 2015 ($10,000 Raised)

Your City? - Spring, 2015 ($15,000 Raised)







Why do people love Cash Stash

1. We're lending a helping hand to animals in need.


In each cash-filled envelope, we hide the story of an animal in
need of adoption. When someone finds the envelope, we unlock the power of
social sharing by asking participants to post the story online in hopes of
finding forever homes for the animals. Please read the story above about
two soul-mates, Roy and Libby! 




2. Cash drives action!


We want to motivate everyone
to go out and support their local animal shelter, so all of the cash-filled envelopes
will have prizes that range from $5 to $50. The more cash we can hide, the more
motivation there will be for everyone to participate in our treasure hunt to get animals adopted!
   



3. It's fun and exciting to hunt for clues!

A large part of the excitement is figuring out where the cash is hidden. We do our best to make the treasure hunt as fun and as family friendly as possible. Although we can’t guarantee everyone will win a prize, we can promise you will have a fun time searching. Watch one of clue videos from Manchester, below.

<p>We
are genuine artisans in Vermont who labor lovingly in the business
niche known as craft chocolate. Doing business as Middlebury
Chocolates, we make chocolate straight from directly traded cacao
beans, and we use this fresh chocolate to create some of the finest
of chocolate bars and confections. All of our chocolate products are
truly luxurious, made in small batches from the finest ingredients
available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We
founded our business in February of 2010 and a few months later
launched a small chocolate café. The following year, we began
producing our own chocolate, and quickly outgrew our tiny kitchen
space. We have moved twice to enhance our production
capabilities, most recently in February 2013, but in doing so we
sacrificed our small café business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now,
effective July 1, 2014, we are leasing a beautiful, commercial space
in downtown Middlebury, next to a picturesque waterfall; the river
runs underneath and next to the building! We expect that the special
qualities of this leased space, combined with our extraordinary
products and our hard work, will produce a wonderful, economically
successful business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Middlebury
is one of the most economically healthy and culturally rich small
towns in Vermont. In our new location, we’ll be benefitting from,
and contributing to, the vitality of the downtown business district.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We
are excited—almost ecstatic!—about bringing our chocolate
café and dessert lounge back to downtown Middlebury!</p>

</p><p>We
are self-sufficient already as producers of super-premium chocolates.
What we need now is additional money to enable us to open the
café and dessert lounge in a timely fashion. With your help, we can
have them open by October 1.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here
is what we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A
	functional POS system and cash register, with software for tracking
	inventory for both retail and wholesale accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Signage
	and accent lighting.</p>

</h3><p></p>
<p>We
have been sharing production space with our kind friends at Daily
Chocolate, which is located in the tiny city of Vergennes, near
Middlebury. This arrangement doesn’t give us enough space and
time. In Vergennes we can produce just enough chocolate bars to
supply our existing 26 wholesale accounts.</p>
<p>When
we move our production into our new space during the month of July,
our production capacity will increase by 40% almost immediately. Our
goal is to double production and sales by the end of this year, so it
is key that we continue adding necessary equipment to achieve these
goals.</p>
<p>When
our café-and-dessert lounge is up and running, it will provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Steady
	employment for three to five local residents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A
	place to go that serves the social and [dietary] needs of many
	Middlebury area residents and visitors. Our dessert lounge will be
	an amazing place to hang out and decompress—especially on

will be produced exclusively for this Indiegogo campaign, made from a
particularly exceptional micro-lot of Venezuelan Patanemo cacao. This
batch will be like nothing you have ever experienced before—the
beans will be lightly wood-fire roasted, mellowed for 10 days in
cocoa ash, then winnowed, crushed, and ground at a low temperature

will be 2.0 ounces (57 grams) and will be delivered in custom

We
are genuine artisans in Vermont who labor lovingly in the business
niche known as craft chocolate. Doing business as Middlebury
Chocolates, we make chocolate straight from directly traded cacao
beans, and we use this fresh chocolate to create some of the finest
of chocolate bars and confections. All of our chocolate products are
truly luxurious, made in small batches from the finest ingredients
available.

We
founded our business in February of 2010 and a few months later
launched a small chocolate café. The following year, we began
producing our own chocolate, and quickly outgrew our tiny kitchen
space. We have moved twice to enhance our production
capabilities, most recently in February 2013, but in doing so we
sacrificed our small café business.

Now,
effective July 1, 2014, we are leasing a beautiful, commercial space
in downtown Middlebury, next to a picturesque waterfall; the river
runs underneath and next to the building! We expect that the special
qualities of this leased space, combined with our extraordinary
products and our hard work, will produce a wonderful, economically
successful business.

Middlebury
is one of the most economically healthy and culturally rich small
towns in Vermont. In our new location, we’ll be benefitting from,
and contributing to, the vitality of the downtown business district.

We
are excited—almost ecstatic!—about bringing our chocolate
café and dessert lounge back to downtown Middlebury!
{a view of our new location, overlooking the Otter Creek falls}What We Need & What You Get...
We
are self-sufficient already as producers of super-premium chocolates.
What we need now is additional money to enable us to open the
café and dessert lounge in a timely fashion. With your help, we can
have them open by October 1.

Here
is what we need:


A
	functional POS system and cash register, with software for tracking
	inventory for both retail and wholesale accounts.


Signage
	and accent lighting.


Indoor
	and outdoor tables and chairs for the café.


An
	additional grinder that makes chocolate from cacao beans, which will
	allow us to greatly increase our chocolate.


An
	additional chocolate tempering machine, which will allow us to
	produce confections and specialty desserts without interfering with
	our production of chocolate bars.


A
	beverage dispenser for homemade sodas, root beer floats, and
	hopefully the hosting of some special local brews in the future.

A
	major upgrade of our website, <middleburychocolates.com>.

{a peak inside our new space}What Difference This Will Make...

have been sharing production space with our kind friends at Daily

Middlebury. This arrangement doesn’t give us enough space and

<p></p><h3>Short Summary<br/>
</h3><p>Despite
global progress in the campaign to address the challenge of HIV/AIDS, Uganda
still ranks higher on world HIV/AIDS prevalence list. According to UNAIDS 2013

other countries continue to experience diminishing statistics, results indicate
an increase in the rate of infection in Uganda.</p>
<p>HIV/AIDS prevalence
rates are on the increase in rural areas of Uganda due to lack of access to interventions
available to urban dwellers. Last year I lost a family member and three friends
to HIV/AIDS and the major cause was lack of access to treatment and early
intervention, a reason why I contacted fellow Directors at <a href=""http://www.fhi-usa.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Face of Hope International USA</a> to create this
project “The Mobile HIV/AIDS Clinic” which is intended to partner with <a href=""http://www.aidshealth.org/#/countries/ug/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">AHF Uganda Cares</a> to take
HIV/AIDS services closer to people in rural areas with this mobile HIV/AIDS
clinic. The Ambulance will stocked with supplies and health professionals will
go deep to villages and provide free testing, counseling, and IRVs, and make
follow-up with those who need advanced treatment. </p>
<p>Face of

I found the courage to leave my abusive husband just under two years ago, in that time I have had another child and rebuilt emotionally but not financially.  

We had run a business together that when I left I was locked out of, I was given the legal choice of funding either to fight for possessions or access to my children, (when I left I decided they were better off with a roof over their head than homeless like I was) so I chose the children and left with a lot of debt, a car and my clothes.  
Through 18 months of courts we now have shared care of our two beautiful children Jack and Selina and absolutely no contact with each other,  and I have Layla to my new partner.  
Now that I am settled into a new life, I want to secure a financial future for my children.  Up until now we have been supported by our government and we could continue to be, but I want to set a better example.  
With young children I was searching for a work from home option and have a business idea selling promotional and humorous products for everyone from businesses to children's parties, a select line of products that has numerous possibilities in our local area and world wide. I have saved enough for a website, business cards, etc, however I need a little more help.

Your $5.00 donation can make my dreams come true, that's less than a cup of coffee.
Why do I want to work from home with my children, being there for them through what could soon be a very trying time is vitally important to the grieving process.  (I have heard that my ex-husband has cancer) I don't have proof but I have seen him recently and he certainly looks ill).   I want to grow strong, confident children that know the world is there oyster.

<p><i>Wasandi Foundation is a
community-based organization focused on on bio-gas and water filtration
projects. Starting in May 2009, our founder, Dr. Abdul Khalique provided the
funding which has allowed Wasandi to build bio-gas plants

has also distributed many bio-sand water filters
in different areas. In April 2010 we launched
the Wasandi Savings and Loan. Our mission is to break the Cycle of
Poverty in our area by providing loans to people who otherwise are not able to

recently, we have started to focus on organic farming. We have planted three
acres of sugarcane crop as a test case while instructing the community to learn
the process in order to be self-sustaining. Our goal is to have farmers using organic
fertilizer for their crops within 12-18 months.</p>

Prices are too high, the service provided isn't what it should be and a lot of lies are being told. By contributing you will help us take over a large part of this service, providing good quality parts, and excellent service & repairs, at an honest price.
We start with Media Markt Gent, most devices get send to big corporate companies with only profit in mind. Repairs take weeks and service is bad & expensive.  Roughly 60% of devices that are send in for service are 'Out of Warranty'. The client has to wait up to 3 weeks before getting their devices back, at a high price, not known in advance.
We take over all these repairs, repair time is cut back to a maximum of 2 days, plus the client knows the price in advance & gets another 6 months of warranty on the service.   What We Need & What You Get How will we spend the funds:  In order to start this service the way it should be, we have to acquire around € 7500. 
The funds will be used to cover some of the expenses we need to make;
50% of the funds WILL be donated to charity!
This includes part of the start-up expenses, professional tools and parts.
We work with the biggest multimedia company on the Belgium market.
We will work with schools, providing training & support to students & teachers. Should we not meet our goal, the funds raised will all go to charity (chosen by the contributors). Because, without it, we can't start at all.    The Impact

We no longer live in a society that throws away a product when it breaks, we recycle. With this project, even less products will get discarded, causing less waste. Everything that can be used again, will be. If even 1 person doesn't trow away their electronic device, it means less junk.
    Risks & Challenges  We are in a unique position with a big player on the market. We start with Media Markt Gent and are already talking to several others, hoping to expand to Media Markt Belgium within the first year. Competition is high in this field, but with the service we offer, and by partnering up with Media Markt, we have the opportunity to get to the top of the pile, providing a better service for everyone.     Show us your support!  If you can't contribute but are interested in what we plan to do, please show your support by sharing our project with your friends,family and associates! Please do use the Indiegogo share tools to do this!   Thank you for reading, hope you liked what you saw!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Actual products may not be exactly as shown in the video and photos of this campaign. We are making Upa Chair and Desk even better, therefore products resulting from this campaign will have improvements, namely Upa Chair will have a curved seat for increased ergonomics.</p>
<p>Manufacturing furniture for children is challenging, that's why we decided to partner with a manufacturer that has an installed capacity ready to respond to our requests and the necessary experience to guarantee the highest quality possible.<br/></p>
<p>Our estimates for delivery are conservative and our partnership is reliable but delays may arise from the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Sourcing of sustainable harvested FSC plywood</li>
<li>Delivery time for screws, nails, fixings and fasteners<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will keep you posted on a weekly basis, and in the event of unexpected situations, we will work hardly to minimize impact on delivery time.</p>

Actual products may not be exactly as shown in the video and photos of this campaign. We are making Upa Chair and Desk even better, therefore products resulting from this campaign will have improvements, namely Upa Chair will have a curved seat for increased ergonomics.
Manufacturing furniture for children is challenging, that's why we decided to partner with a manufacturer that has an installed capacity ready to respond to our requests and the necessary experience to guarantee the highest quality possible.
Our estimates for delivery are conservative and our partnership is reliable but delays may arise from the following: 

Sourcing of sustainable harvested FSC plywood
Delivery time for screws, nails, fixings and fasteners


We will keep you posted on a weekly basis, and in the event of unexpected situations, we will work hardly to minimize impact on delivery time.",48.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Who Are We &amp; How Did We Get Here?</strong></p>

<p>We are Kate Merrill and Paige Tyler - Chefs and Co-Owners of Edge of Sweetness Bakery located in Edgewater, a lakefront community on the North Side of Chicago.  We met last year while building our individual bakery brands at a local shared kitchen. We instantly connected - sharing a passion for quality homemade baked goods and a dream to own a neighborhood bakery.  It didn't take long for us to merge our existing bakery brands, and Edge of Sweetness was born! </p>
<p>We quickly identified what we wanted our business to accomplish - and narrowed it down to three overarching goals: </p>
<ol>
<li>To create a community bakery and coffee shop where neighbors can come together and enjoy quality baked goods, coffee, and teas. We are dedicated to producing an array of fresh and delicious products, ensuring each customer has a memorable experience that will keep them coming back for more. </li>
<li>Because we started our baking careers working in a shared kitchen space, it is also important for us to extend our spacious kitchen to other chefs who are starting or building their own culinary businesses.</li>
<li>And as parents, we have a passion for our local community and will actively support causes that promote exercise through school sports programs and healthy eating programs for the children based in the Edgewater neighborhoods. </li>
</ol>
<p>Keeping those objectives top of mind, we've worked diligently to fine tune a solid and profitable business plan and select the perfect retail location for Edge of Sweetness. We decided on a 3,200 square foot, corner retail spot with expansive windows and room for an outdoor patio in the warmer months. The spot is the perfect gathering space for Edgewater families, commuters, tourists and ""work from home"" employees; and is spacious enough to allow for events and parties, as well as cooking classes. And keeping in line with our goals, we also have room for designated shared kitchen spaces where other chefs can have an opportunity to expand their growing businesses, especially throughout the Edgewater community.</p>

<p>But having a solid business plan and finding the perfect empty retail space was only the beginning. We spent this past Summer working  tirelessly on securing the bakery space, and the multitude of city licenses and building permits required to get our bakery going. </p>

<p>In the meantime, we scoured the city for bakery and coffee equipment - ovens, sinks, coolers, freezers, bakery tables, floor mixers, rolling racks and oh-so-many cookie sheets, cake pans, and whisks - oh my! We met with countless retail vendors- for tables, chairs, counters, display cases, window blinds, lighting, flooring, and shelving! Who knew they even made washable ceiling tiles, let alone required them in a kitchen? Then there were the never-ending interviews with construction contractors, plumbers, and electricians - that all promised they could take all of this stuff and whip it into a working bakery! </p>

<p>We never knew the challenges of being women business owners until we began the process of opening our own brick and mortar bakery.  We were initial challenged by the male-dominated field of commercial architecture and construction, until they realized we were tenacious, teachable, and willing to roll up our sleeves and do the dirty work.  We're no longer strangers to a jack hammer, sledge hammer, concrete saw, or shovel! We've been there every step of the way, contributing where we can - all while continuing to expand our bakery clientele. We have a fabulous and collaborative team of contractors who see our passion and vision, and are working diligently to help us make it a reality. </p>
<p>As strong women, we would like to think we can do everything on our own. But we've learned, the hard way, that we can't do it all. And sometimes you have to ask for help. Amazingly, every time we ask for help, we get an army of assistance. We want to fund this project ourselves, do as much work as possible, and continue to serve our amazing customers.  It has been those amazing customers who have encouraged us to reach out and open ourselves up to ""the village"" approach! <i>If you join us, we promise to uphold our end of the bargain!</i></p>

<h3>The Michelle Wie Tournament of Champions<br/>
</h3>
<p>We are so excited to have Michelle Wie join us as the official ambassador of 
the Hawaii State Junior Golf Association (HSJGA) Tournament of Champions. The TOC is 
an annual event that gathers top talents in Hawaii junior golf to the beautiful 
Wailea Resort in Maui to battle it out for the coveted Tournament of Champions 
title. Michelle herself won the 15-18 age division in 2002 as a 12 year 
old! </p>
<p><em>Purpose of the event</em>: The Michelle Wie Tournament of Champions will 
be the key fundraiser for the HSJGA, and the funds will go towards tournament 
operation costs, new tournament development, and 
Hawaii youth golf development in general. With the funds raised through this 
campaign, we would like to start awarding <span>travel scholarships to help our 
juniors travel inter-island and to the mainland for golf tournaments. These 
scholarships would allow some extremely talented kids on HSJGA that may lack the 
resources to cover high travel expenses to compete on the national 
junior/amateur circuit. </span></p>
<p><strong>Michelle Wie's statement:</strong> </p>
<p>HSJGA and I go way back to when I was just a kid who loved to hit the 
ball a long way. They gave me the opportunity to develop my game and competitive 
drive in an open, nurturing environment - they really made it possible for me to 
take my game to the next level. This is my chance to give back to the 
organization and help the young golfers in Hawaii grow in this game that's given 
me so much.</p>
<p><em>Partners:</em></p>

<p>Hi guys! My name is Cierra and I am currently volunteering at Mombasa, Kenya for the summer with WOFAK (Women Fighting AIDS in Kenya) through DukeEngage, a summer program funded by Duke to send their students all over the world to participate in civic engagement work. It's been a great experience and I am asking for your support as I am trying to do something really impactful here. I am currently starting a pilot project to bring HIV/AIDS testing and basic medical services to unreached slum communities who lack access to even the most basic care, but we lack the financial means to fully implement it. The project will cost $4000, but $3000 is already funded via local resources and organizations (Deutsche Stiftung Weltbevolkerung, Tupange, Dream Achievers Youth Organization, Foundation for Sustainable Development, WOFAK) so I need raise $1000 by August 1<sup>st</sup>. Money will go towards mobilization for all involved staffs and medical supplies, water and snack supplies during the camp, mobilizers for the community, and airtime for communication. It would be so great if you could support me in this endeavor.</p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h3><span>A little background</span></h3>
<p><span>But before anything, a little about the first targeted community... Junda is a slum community of approximately 40,000 people dispersed throughout an area of 10.5 km</span><sup><span>2</span></sup><span>. Many of the households, if not all, live in poverty and cannot afford transportation to government medical facilities to receive care because the time they must sacrifice to travel the distance by foot. Also, many of the homes are inaccessible by vehicles. From personal accounts, some have to walk for hours and sometimes, wait for days to finally get any sort of medical care. The consequences: Days of no work, no pay, no dinner.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h2><span>The big project</span></h2>
<p><span>To address this, I want to implement a one-day pilot-program medical camp called Inuka Uangaze (rise and shine; a saying that lifts up spirits here in Kenya) here in Junda to give the community members free HIV/AIDS-related testing and medical support. Through our partnership with multiple organizations, we will provide medical services (i.e. cervical cancer screening, family planning, HIV/AIDS testing and counseling) and an interactive assembly, where community members will be informed on the importance of their testing and ways to over the feelings associated with the stigma for HIV/AIDS. We will also connect the participants to support groups, community health workers, and organizations based on their needs.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h3><span>Future development</span></h3>
<p><span>Most medical outreaches choose locations that are convenient for the general population, thus isolating a rather large portion of Kenya’s population. This pilot program, if successful through your support, will be the pioneer and an example for future endeavors in reaching and impacting once unreached slum communities. This camp is not about making a one-time impact; it’s about creating a life-sustaining change for a neglected group of people. At the conclusion of the camp, we will have once unavailable compiled data to present to the government and donors for further funding and interventions.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h3><span>Help us be a blessing</span></h3>
<p><span>So please help me raise $1000 by <span class=""aBn""><span class=""aQJ"">August 1</span></span></span><sup><span>st</span></sup><span> and I will be ever grateful. Any amount will help tremendously. Seriously. I’ll take anything! Anything over our goal will go towards supporting the future of this program. And last but not least, please, share this with your friends and family! Thank you so much!</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h2>And last but not least... rewards!</h2>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Any donations $25 or above will get... </h3>
<p>a personal thank you note and a wonderful group photo of the people you graciously supported. AND, you will get an authentic Masai bracelet (some images below; more can be found at <a href=""http://goo.gl/Dt8bR"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://goo.gl/Dt8bR</a>). These are vibrant bracelets that surely make you stand out! As you can see, these vary GREATLY so if you have a color/design preference, please let me know via comments and I will try my best to find something that matches that.</p>
<h3>Any donations $75 and above will get....</h3>
<p>everything from above and an authentic handmade kikoy blanket (image below; more can be found at <a href=""http://goo.gl/AuWjj"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://goo.gl/AuWjj</a>).  Soft and thin, they serve as great beach towels, light blanket, or just something to throw over while watching TV. Again, these vary a lot too so if you have a preference, please leave a comment and I will do my best to find something for you!</p>

Future development
Most medical outreaches choose locations that are convenient for the general population, thus isolating a rather large portion of Kenya’s population. This pilot program, if successful through your support, will be the pioneer and an example for future endeavors in reaching and impacting once unreached slum communities. This camp is not about making a one-time impact; it’s about creating a life-sustaining change for a neglected group of people. At the conclusion of the camp, we will have once unavailable compiled data to present to the government and donors for further funding and interventions.
 
Help us be a blessing
So please help me raise $1000 by August 1st and I will be ever grateful. Any amount will help tremendously. Seriously. I’ll take anything! Anything over our goal will go towards supporting the future of this program. And last but not least, please, share this with your friends and family! Thank you so much!


 
And last but not least... rewards!


Any donations $25 or above will get... 
a personal thank you note and a wonderful group photo of the people you graciously supported. AND, you will get an authentic Masai bracelet (some images below; more can be found at http://goo.gl/Dt8bR). These are vibrant bracelets that surely make you stand out! As you can see, these vary GREATLY so if you have a color/design preference, please let me know via comments and I will try my best to find something that matches that.
Any donations $75 and above will get....
everything from above and an authentic handmade kikoy blanket (image below; more can be found at http://goo.gl/AuWjj).  Soft and thin, they serve as great beach towels, light blanket, or just something to throw over while watching TV. Again, these vary a lot too so if you have a preference, please leave a comment and I will do my best to find something for you!

<h3>Why do we care?</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>Approximately 842 million people (one in eight people in the world) do not have enough to eat and suffer from chronic hunger. Each year more than 11 million children die from preventable health issues such as malaria, diarrhea and pneumonia. Over 1.4 billion people live on $1.25 a day or less and 22,000 children die each day due to conditions of poverty. Over 1.7 billion people lack access to clean water and 2.3 people suffer from water-borne diseases each year. </span></p>

<p>We need a website in order for us to be accessible to the grassroots organizations that need our services the most. It will cost us $500 for a website. We are working with a web designer who has offered to design and set up our website at a reduced cost due to our non-profit status.</p>
