<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Topper Sundquist. A couple years back, I IndieGogo'd funds to illustrate and publish a book co-written with my daughters, titled 'Princess Ninja'.  It was the story of a young girl who was born a little... different, than the rest of her family. The final result was more awesome than I could have imagined, and I couldn't have done it without the help and support of friends and family.</p>
<p>WHELP... I'm at it again. </p>
<p>'Powered By Candy' is a story about two siblings, tasked with the nearly insurmountable task of most awesome breadth and peril: clean their bedroom. Realizing that this was, indeed, a fate worse than death, they turned their vast intellects to the most obvious solution, namely a robot that will clean their bedroom FOR them. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to poor planning, their robot was designed to be powered by candy, which they can't afford until they get their allowance. </p>
<p> </p>

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>Young Adult Life: Navigating the Best and Worst Years contains stories from everyday people navigating young adult life and mental health. This book was made to be your friend in times of loneliness and in times of growth.<br/><br/>My name is Colleen Finney, and I am the author of Young Adult Life: Navigating the Best and Worst Years. I wrote this book because, throughout my own mental health journey, I read many self-help books that made me feel like what I was going through wasn’t acceptable or okay. They made me feel like an alien and often gave me a three-step guide to changing my life. It never worked and made me feel worse. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that there are many people your age dealing with similar struggles. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for navigating the highs and lows of life as well as the stigma behind mental health. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you not feel alone in the worst times and to use the advice given from everyday people in the best times. <br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about many mental health topics and how people worked through them, as well as the struggles people deal with every day and the advice they give to get to the other side of the tunnel. You'll hear stories about:<p>Being in relationships and going through breakups as a young adult.</p>
<p>Breaking down your childhood trauma and seeing how it sets the foundation for the rest of your life. </p>
<p>How depression can consume you and what it can teach you in the long run.</p>You will love this book if you have dealt with the highs and lows of life, struggles throughout your own mental health journey, or just need to feel like you’re not alone. <br/><br/>Young Adult Life: Navigating the Best and Worst Years is a nonfiction book that speaks to young adults and people juggling mental health who want to look at mental health topics surrounding people, moments, and internal struggles in a new way.<p> </p>
<h2>The Book — Young Adult Life: Navigating the Best and Worst Years</h2>The book is written in three parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1 (People)</strong> contains the introduction and chapters Family Isn’t Everything, Relationships: the good, the bad, &amp; the ugly, and Friends: they come and go. This section covers the outside source of mental health that you can’t control: other people. This section includes stories of being in relationships and going through breakups, as well as weird family dynamics and the trauma they can cause. <br/><br/><strong>Part 2 (Moments)</strong> contains chapters Childhood Trauma: the foundation of it all, The Best and Worst Years of Your Life, and “That will never happen to me.” This section covers the moments in your life that have a lasting impact on your past, present, and future. This section includes stories about how childhood trauma affects the rest of your life and my own story with being sexually assaulted. <br/><br/><strong>Part 3 (Internal Struggles)</strong> contains chapters Normalizing Depression, The Power of Support with Depression, The Fear of the Unknown: exciting, but oh so scary, Accepting Living with the Impossible, Therapy and Seeking Help, and the Conclusion. This section covers the biggest part of mental health: the mental part. It includes everything that affects you internally and the world around you. This section includes stories from others about their struggles with depression and anxiety, as well as the ups and downs of living with an illness or diagnosis. <h2> </h2>
<h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>

<p>The Cover Design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)</p>
<p>The Layout Design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).</p>
<p>The Copyediting for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</p>
<p>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this winter. </p>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:<p>You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish and a handwritten thank-you note.</p>

<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p>Colleen Finney is an aspiring broadcast journalist who just recently graduated from the University of Kentucky and is on the hunt for her first “big girl” job!<br/><br/>During her time at UK, she published many blogs about her struggles with depression and mental health, and the feedback she received was alarming! She knew then that someday she wanted to write a book that was the friend her blog post had been for others. She is also very passionate about mental health and wants to help change the stigma behind it. She thinks it’s time we start talking about our feelings and struggles because they are the things that make us human. <br/><br/>Outside of this book, she is your average, everyday young adult trying to figure out life, just like the rest of you. She still goes to therapy and is very much still trying to figure out what makes her feel alive and what drags her down. She loves spending time with her friends and family and making memories any way she can. <br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Colleen at cefinney99@gmail.com and on social media!<br/><br/>Instagram: <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/_colllleeeen_/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.instagram.com/_colllleeeen_/</a><br/>Facebook: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/colleen.finney.3/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/colleen.finney.3/</a><br/>Twitter: <a href=""https://twitter.com/_colllleeeen_"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://twitter.com/_colllleeeen_</a><br/>LinkedIn: <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/colleen-finney/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/colleen-finney/</a> </p>

</ul>
<p><br/>Meeting the $2,500 goal guarantees 100 copies of the book get made. If we more than meet the goal, and if Perk requests exceed 100 – well, then we'll print more books. That just means you all are more awesome than I could've imagined. </p>

We’d like to change the physical dimensions of the book, transforming its chapbook-like shape into a less traditionally bound medium. This year, we also want to incorporate more visually engaging art--since last year LUX was limited to printing only two full-color pieces. <br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/883426/files/20140925202807-IMG_0092.jpg?1411702087"" src="""" style=""""/></p><a href=""http://luminajournal.com/the-gravedigger-by-donna-emerson-originally-publish-in-lux-vol-i-2013/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">(Click here for a multimedia experience ) </a><div>
<h1><b><br/></b></h1>
<h1><b>GOALS </b></h1>
<div>
<p>This year, we seek to deepen the connections between color and literary expression. We want the journal’s visual elements to be as rich as its written and spoken ones.  We also want to deepen LUX’s breadth of content; last year we had fiction, poetry, and one moving film, and this year, we’d like include storytelling through the form of podcasts, songs, both written and instrumental, along with a greater number of film submissions.<br/></p>

</div>
<div>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Help Us Bring LUX to A Greater Audience</h3>
<p>In order to make these expansions and build upon the artistic intent of the project, we’ll need to raise at least $3,000 to account for both higher quality print materials and the necessary marketing budget for spreading awareness of LUX and increasing its annual submissions, as well as to compensate both new and established artists for their contributions to the journal.  The more resources we have available to further our vision of LUX as a rare hybrid of interactive media, the more we can share it with a greater audience and create a rich array of work by artists of all mediums. <br/></p>

<h3><i>We strive to connect with the world simultaneously through the beauty of the printed page and by engaging with the limitless space of technology. </i></h3>
The success of LUX largely depends on how effectively we will be able to cull and collaborate with a range of artists across the media spectrum.  With greater funding and resources, the production schedule of the journal is destined to be more labor intensive than it was for prior publications.  We face the challenge of coordinating and synchronizing the vastly varied visions of the painters, photographers, writers, filmmakers, and podcasters chosen for each publication.  As such, our layout planning and execution using technology will also be more involved.  Despite these potential obstacles, however, we know our staff will rise to the challenge and maximize opportunities made available by greater funding and wider community support.<br/>

</div></div>","LUX uses technology to re-imagine the relationship between written and spoken word, visual art, and the traditionally bound journal.
LUX was created in 2013. It was the brainchild of the combined efforts of Sarah Lawrence alumni Nicole Cloutier, Christina Harrington, and Carolyn Silveria. And it was an instant hit. This multimedia oriented creation takes the concept of a literary journal and spins it on its head. The end result? QR codes and poetry; photography and short stories; fiction and film; and, we hope, a continued interplay of other mediums.  (Learn more about Lux) This year, as we put together LUX Volume II, we want to take the word ‘multimedia’ to a new level. We seek to build upon the strong foundation begun last year by expanding the journal’s print quality, visual arts technology, and spread of artistic content.Last year, while we still managed to create a beautiful, letterbound journal with a simple, eye-catching cover, we are ready to take the printing to a new level. We’d like to change the physical dimensions of the book, transforming its chapbook-like shape into a less traditionally bound medium. This year, we also want to incorporate more visually engaging art--since last year LUX was limited to printing only two full-color pieces. (Click here for a multimedia experience ) 

GOALS 

This year, we seek to deepen the connections between color and literary expression. We want the journal’s visual elements to be as rich as its written and spoken ones.  We also want to deepen LUX’s breadth of content; last year we had fiction, poetry, and one moving film, and this year, we’d like include storytelling through the form of podcasts, songs, both written and instrumental, along with a greater number of film submissions.


(Listen to MEMBRANE) 



Help Us Bring LUX to A Greater Audience
In order to make these expansions and build upon the artistic intent of the project, we’ll need to raise at least $3,000 to account for both higher quality print materials and the necessary marketing budget for spreading awareness of LUX and increasing its annual submissions, as well as to compensate both new and established artists for their contributions to the journal.  The more resources we have available to further our vision of LUX as a rare hybrid of interactive media, the more we can share it with a greater audience and create a rich array of work by artists of all mediums. 






We strive to connect with the world simultaneously through the beauty of the printed page and by engaging with the limitless space of technology. 
The success of LUX largely depends on how effectively we will be able to cull and collaborate with a range of artists across the media spectrum.  With greater funding and resources, the production schedule of the journal is destined to be more labor intensive than it was for prior publications.  We face the challenge of coordinating and synchronizing the vastly varied visions of the painters, photographers, writers, filmmakers, and podcasters chosen for each publication.  As such, our layout planning and execution using technology will also be more involved.  Despite these potential obstacles, however, we know our staff will rise to the challenge and maximize opportunities made available by greater funding and wider community support.

<p><b>Kaia and the Birthday Kites </b>is a fictional story of one determined young girl's mission to spend her birthday with the man she admires most, and for her dad to spend his birthday with the daughter he loves.  Dad is an inmate at Jessup, a maximum security prison in the suburbs of Baltimore.</p>

<p><b><i>Approximately 2.7 million children under the age of 18 have a parent in state or federal
prison</i> </b>according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, and the
number keeps growing. These
children have a higher risk for drugs and alcohol abuse, antisocial behavior,
dropping out of school or declining in schoolwork, as well as aggression,
disruptive behaviors, and depression when compared to other children. These factors make it more likely that the children will enter the prison system
when they are adults. <b>Kaia and the
Birthday Kites</b> author, Larry Bratt, is an inmate at Jessup and sees these
statistics become reality all too often. This book is
positioned to give hope to the children of the nation's incarcerated, and
to encourage them to follow a different path than their incarcerated parents. We also hope that this book can start a dialogue within our nation, and throughout the world, about these often hidden victims of incarceration. </p>

<h2><b>HOW CAN I HELP?</b></h2>
<p>Author Larry Bratt has turned around his life and, in the main, has turned around the lives of many others inside and outside the walls of Jessup.  That's why we're asking you to help us get him published. We want to spread Larry's (and Kaia's) message of perseverance and why it's important to do what's right even if your life didn't start out that way.</p>
<p>We need your help by donating funds and spreading the word about this book. Larry needs your help, too.  After covering production costs, Larry intends to take his portion of sales revenue from 'Kaia and the Birthday Kites' and reinvest in the young and the old. Larry will commit a portion of his proceeds to the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland's 'Camp Amazing Grace' for the children of incarcerated dads and moms so that they can attend summer camp. He will also invest his proceeds into the Prison Hospice program to bring comfort to and improve palliative care for inmates who are terminally ill. Your donation will continue to give long after this book is completed. </p>
<p>Our intention is to first publish 'Kaia and the Birthday Kites' under our TNP banner.  But we won't stop there. We will present the story, along with data from the book's first year of release (2016), to a leading children's publisher, one that already has the distribution channels to bring Kaia to a much larger readership. </p>

<p><b>WHO WE ARE:</b></p>
<p>Too Nuts Productions (TNP) is
an online collaboration of writers, editors, producers, sound designers,
composers, and illustrators spanning six cities across the U.S.  We also
have a troupe of in-house voiceover actors who bring many of our stories to
life. And we are represented by one of the most respected licensing agents in
the industry.</p>
<p>The TNP team develops literary content for application to a
variety of print, audio, and digital platforms. One of our projects, 'The
Salivating Salamander,' captured The Pacificus Foundation Award in the
Children's Literature category.  As you read this, the TNP collaboration
has projects in review at three of the largest children's entertainment
distributors and third-party content developers in the industry. Most of our
projects are generated from our in-house production team, however, we do
consider a handful of intriguing, creative, and spirit-enriching projects from
outside the company.  Kaia and the Birthday Kites is one of those
projects. </p>

<p></p>
<p><b>WHY WE DECIDED TO SIGN
THE PROJECT AND TO WORK WITH AN INMATE-TURNED-AUTHOR...</b></p>
<p>Larry’s story, which he started in 2006, and which was only
18 pages at the outset of his venture into publishing, was rejected by more
than 30 publishers. That's when he came across our company. About this
time, TNP was moving offices. We discovered the nondescript 10x14 clasp
envelop stamped ""Inmate Mail,"" which had been placed in a box for
unsolicited manuscripts the year before. We opened it and began to read. The note inside this envelope almost moved us to
tears. Within, Larry had enclosed a speech he had given back in 2001, when he
already had spent more than 19 years behind bars for homicide. The speech,
titled, Think
Tank Realities, opened with this
paragraph: The Roman philosopher Lucretius said, “The moment a man decides to
change is the exact moment of that man’s death.” Inside this room and outside
this building are many men who long ago decided to change not only their
behavior but also their character. For those of us who have changed from
criminal to responsible and caring human beings, we have been transformed just
as the caterpillar crawling in dirt is transformed into a butterfly capable of
flying with a celestial beauty.</p>
<p>When 'Kaia and the Birthday Kites' is published under the Too
Nuts Productions banner, TNP will own the rights to the story but Larry, the
author, will receive 60% of the proceeds from future sales. He will use his
revenues to fund his prison causes. </p>

<p><b>WHERE WE ARE NOW: </b></p>
<p>The story is currently in second round editorial. It will
undergo a minimum of three editorial passes: Draft A w/ Edits, Draft B w/
Edits, and Draft C w/ Edits. To ensure continuity, strong characterization,
believable dialogue, unpredictable plot twists and an overall really exciting
read, TNP has tapped two of the most engaging editors in the industry. TNP is
currently exploring both foreign and domestic printing sources. We would like
to produce the project entirely in the U.S.  Budgetary considerations may
render this option futile.  But we are exploring the option.</p>
<p>At $29,000, you might at first conclude that ""Hey, that's a
lot of money only to produce a children's book, isn't it?"" In fact, when
you factor in illustration, book design, editorial and manufacturing costs, as
well as support services like legal (intellectual property protection /
contracts) and accounting (to make sure we stay on budget), you'd be impressed
at how quickly you can burn through the production budget. We are not going to
allow that to happen. Hence why we've contracted the accounting firm of 'Dawn
Catherine Taxes &amp; Accounting' (DawnCatherine.com). Dawn Catherine, E.A., an

</div></div>","Kaia and the Birthday Kites is a fictional story of one determined young girl's mission to spend her birthday with the man she admires most, and for her dad to spend his birthday with the daughter he loves.  Dad is an inmate at Jessup, a maximum security prison in the suburbs of Baltimore.

Left: 'Kaia'  (Illustration by Christopher Hunter.) 
Approximately 2.7 million children under the age of 18 have a parent in state or federal
prison according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, and the
number keeps growing. These
children have a higher risk for drugs and alcohol abuse, antisocial behavior,
dropping out of school or declining in schoolwork, as well as aggression,
disruptive behaviors, and depression when compared to other children. These factors make it more likely that the children will enter the prison system
when they are adults. Kaia and the
Birthday Kites author, Larry Bratt, is an inmate at Jessup and sees these
statistics become reality all too often. This book is
positioned to give hope to the children of the nation's incarcerated, and
to encourage them to follow a different path than their incarcerated parents. We also hope that this book can start a dialogue within our nation, and throughout the world, about these often hidden victims of incarceration. 


THE STORY:
Kaia is about to turn 13. 
Her birthday is on March 25th.  So is her dad's. Like any young girl about to celebrate a big day, she wants to celebrate it with the one she loves most. Only one problem. She'll have to get past the guards.  And the watchtower.  And the electric fence.  And the angry dogs tethered to leather straps.  Because Kaia wants to deliver dad a present, the perfect gift for dad and daughter to share. And the ultimate symbol of freedom: two kites. On father and daughter's birthday, Kaia wants to fly those kites with dad...in the prison yard.

HOW CAN I HELP?
Author Larry Bratt has turned around his life and, in the main, has turned around the lives of many others inside and outside the walls of Jessup.  That's why we're asking you to help us get him published. We want to spread Larry's (and Kaia's) message of perseverance and why it's important to do what's right even if your life didn't start out that way.
We need your help by donating funds and spreading the word about this book. Larry needs your help, too.  After covering production costs, Larry intends to take his portion of sales revenue from 'Kaia and the Birthday Kites' and reinvest in the young and the old. Larry will commit a portion of his proceeds to the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland's 'Camp Amazing Grace' for the children of incarcerated dads and moms so that they can attend summer camp. He will also invest his proceeds into the Prison Hospice program to bring comfort to and improve palliative care for inmates who are terminally ill. Your donation will continue to give long after this book is completed. 
Our intention is to first publish 'Kaia and the Birthday Kites' under our TNP banner.  But we won't stop there. We will present the story, along with data from the book's first year of release (2016), to a leading children's publisher, one that already has the distribution channels to bring Kaia to a much larger readership.

THE INMATE WHO WROTE 'Kaia and the Birthday
Kites'...
AUTHOR LARRY BRATT, now 62, is no stranger to correctional
institutions. He's been serving time for involvement in a double
homicide since 1981 and has been in the real Jessup Penitentiary since
2001. Larry has changed. He is no longer the man who, at a much younger age,
committed a serious felony. Larry has pulled together the
support and insights of his fellow inmates to launch and drive a
hospice program for terminally ill prisoners, a children's book program that
provides picture books to inmates with kids, and a gang intervention program
that strategizes ways to encourage gangs to redirect their hunger for
power into powerful actions for positive change in the communities
where they live. Larry has won numerous awards and certificates of
commendation. More than 350 of his
articles and Op-Ed pieces, many addressing the issue of prison
reform, have been published in major market newspapers likeTHE WASHINGTON POST and THE BALTIMORE SUN.

BALTIMORE SUN BREAKS THE STORY ON LARRY BRATT'S CHILDREN'S BOOK
Among the programs he has helped inspire and initiate are:
'READING UNITES FAMILIES'-- a reading program that allows incarcerated fathers and
mothers to read with their children;
'EXTRA LEGALESE GROUP'-- awarded a Certificate of Recognition by the State of Maryland
Attorney General, this in-prison group develops proven strategies for gang
violence intervention within the community outside the prison; and
'HOSPICE BEHIND THE
WALLS'-- one of the first programs of its kind, this hospice 
proactively addresses and helps meet the physical, emotional, and spiritual
needs of inmates with terminal illnesses.











WHO WE ARE:
Too Nuts Productions (TNP) is
an online collaboration of writers, editors, producers, sound designers,
composers, and illustrators spanning six cities across the U.S.  We also
have a troupe of in-house voiceover actors who bring many of our stories to
life. And we are represented by one of the most respected licensing agents in
the industry.
The TNP team develops literary content for application to a
variety of print, audio, and digital platforms. One of our projects, 'The
Salivating Salamander,' captured The Pacificus Foundation Award in the
Children's Literature category.  As you read this, the TNP collaboration
has projects in review at three of the largest children's entertainment
distributors and third-party content developers in the industry. Most of our
projects are generated from our in-house production team, however, we do
consider a handful of intriguing, creative, and spirit-enriching projects from
outside the company.  Kaia and the Birthday Kites is one of those
projects.

WHY WE DECIDED TO SIGN
THE PROJECT AND TO WORK WITH AN INMATE-TURNED-AUTHOR...
Larry’s story, which he started in 2006, and which was only
18 pages at the outset of his venture into publishing, was rejected by more
than 30 publishers. That's when he came across our company. About this
time, TNP was moving offices. We discovered the nondescript 10x14 clasp
envelop stamped ""Inmate Mail,"" which had been placed in a box for
unsolicited manuscripts the year before. We opened it and began to read. The note inside this envelope almost moved us to
tears. Within, Larry had enclosed a speech he had given back in 2001, when he
already had spent more than 19 years behind bars for homicide. The speech,
titled, Think
Tank Realities, opened with this
paragraph: The Roman philosopher Lucretius said, “The moment a man decides to
change is the exact moment of that man’s death.” Inside this room and outside
this building are many men who long ago decided to change not only their
behavior but also their character. For those of us who have changed from
criminal to responsible and caring human beings, we have been transformed just
as the caterpillar crawling in dirt is transformed into a butterfly capable of
flying with a celestial beauty.
When 'Kaia and the Birthday Kites' is published under the Too
Nuts Productions banner, TNP will own the rights to the story but Larry, the
author, will receive 60% of the proceeds from future sales. He will use his
revenues to fund his prison causes.

WHERE WE ARE NOW: 
The story is currently in second round editorial. It will
undergo a minimum of three editorial passes: Draft A w/ Edits, Draft B w/
Edits, and Draft C w/ Edits. To ensure continuity, strong characterization,
believable dialogue, unpredictable plot twists and an overall really exciting
read, TNP has tapped two of the most engaging editors in the industry. TNP is
currently exploring both foreign and domestic printing sources. We would like
to produce the project entirely in the U.S.  Budgetary considerations may
render this option futile.  But we are exploring the option.
At $29,000, you might at first conclude that ""Hey, that's a
lot of money only to produce a children's book, isn't it?"" In fact, when
you factor in illustration, book design, editorial and manufacturing costs, as
well as support services like legal (intellectual property protection /
contracts) and accounting (to make sure we stay on budget), you'd be impressed
at how quickly you can burn through the production budget. We are not going to
allow that to happen. Hence why we've contracted the accounting firm of 'Dawn
Catherine Taxes & Accounting' (DawnCatherine.com). Dawn Catherine, E.A., an
'Enrolled Agent,' sits on the boards of 10 banks and is one of the most
respected accountants in Northern California. A portion of the budget will go towards donating some Kaia and the Birthday Kites books to different prisons.

There are loons in Wisconsin too! And in Maine, so we've been told.<br/><br/>We read ""Goodnight Moon"" to our kids all time and have come to love the nuance and detail brought out by illustrator Clement Hurd. The change in the moon's trajectory, the advancement of the clock, the little mouse's explorations and the dying fire. We've worked hard to capture the original book's lyrical charm and detail while at the same time making it local from start to finish, top to bottom. The book features walleyes, pies, rod, fish, a hotdish, ticks, food on sticks, an old voyageur, a hungry raccoon, a curious loon and much more. <br/><br/>""Goodnight Loon"" will be a full board book, made of stout, durable cardboard pages. Throw it against the wall, run over it with a bicycle, spill ice cream on the cover... this book will be printed to endure. (Look at the prototypes above; so pretty!)<br/><br/>Even better, a portion of each sale will benefit northwoods wildlife and habitats.<br/><br/>With the help of a few generous donors and your support, we will be able to minimize the funding target to make ""Goodnight Loon"" possible while at the same time offering the books at the low price of $10... including shipping. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/115372/files/20131005210725-007-proof-1.jpg?1381032445"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

EVERYONE!While we came just a few hundred dollars short of our goal, ""Goodnight Loon"" is a success. Nearly 100 people supported us, getting themselves a truly unique book and in the process raising $711 for the Audubon Center of the North Woods and 48 (!) books for the Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota's Wee Read, a program that provides books to children staying in the hospital's NICU, ICC or SCN. For those waiting for books (and books with extras), we expect to have them delivered to you by Dec 13. Meanwhile, for those interested in meeting us or in more books, the authors will be part of a small ""Goodnight Loon"" event at Garrison Keillor's Common Good Books in St. Paul, MN on Dec. 21 at 2:00 pm. For more information or to ask us anything, please email info@goodnightloon.com. Thank you!UPDATE 1: MONDAY WEE READ
PROGRAM BOOK MATCH!One support level allows you to buy a copy and donate a copy of ""Goodnight Loon"" to the Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota's Wee Reads, a program that provides books to children staying in the hospital's NICU, ICC or SCN. We will now MATCH every Ole and Lena Level, Wee Read book donation made, one for one. That means, if 30 books are donated to Wee Read, we will match and donate ANOTHER 30 books! UPDATE 2: ""GOODNIGHT LOON"" IS
HAPPENING NO MATTER WHAT As we move into the last hours of funding, we want to thank everyone for their valuable support. As ""Goodnight Loon"" was flexibly funded, we will be producing and sending everyone their books even if we do not meet our target. Our current target date to deliver the book to you is December 13. Meanwhile, to get a fun idea of what you get with the book, watch the video above of one Minnesota grandfather reading ""Goodnight Loon.""
'GOODNIGHT LOON' THE BOOK


AT ITS SIMPLEST, this book is ""Goodnight Moon"" for the northwoods. By ""northwoods"" we mean both the glorious Boundary Waters Canoe Area as well as all of the canoeing, camping, fishing and hunting areas in the American mid-north (or Canadian south). There are loons in Wisconsin too! And in Maine, so we've been told.We read ""Goodnight Moon"" to our kids all time and have come to love the nuance and detail brought out by illustrator Clement Hurd. The change in the moon's trajectory, the advancement of the clock, the little mouse's explorations and the dying fire. We've worked hard to capture the original book's lyrical charm and detail while at the same time making it local from start to finish, top to bottom. The book features walleyes, pies, rod, fish, a hotdish, ticks, food on sticks, an old voyageur, a hungry raccoon, a curious loon and much more. ""Goodnight Loon"" will be a full board book, made of stout, durable cardboard pages. Throw it against the wall, run over it with a bicycle, spill ice cream on the cover... this book will be printed to endure. (Look at the prototypes above; so pretty!)Even better, a portion of each sale will benefit northwoods wildlife and habitats.With the help of a few generous donors and your support, we will be able to minimize the funding target to make ""Goodnight Loon"" possible while at the same time offering the books at the low price of $10... including shipping. 
YOU GIVE A BOOK TO 'WEE READS' / WE GIVE 25% TO THE AUDUBON CENTER OF THE NORTH WOODS
ONE OF OUR REWARDS allows you to buy a copy and donate a copy of ""Goodnight Loon"" to the Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota's Wee Reads, a program that provides books to children staying in the hospital's NICU, ICC or SCN. We will also be donating 25 percent of all profits from the ""Goodnight Loon"" launch to the Audubon Center of the North Woods. On Grindstone Lake, the Audubon Center operates a 535-acre sanctuary for local animals, hardwood forests, wetlands and prairies and, of course, loons. The center also operates a wildlife rehab facility and an environmental learning center that is visited by thousands of area K to 12 students every year.  


FUN, LOCAL REWARDS INCLUDING GARRISON KEILLOR AND DULUTH PACK
IN ADDITION TO THE BOOK, we have a collection of fun, odd and local rewards. Make your copy of ""Goodnight Loon"" interactive with a plush loon. Other support levels include a copy of the excellent crop art biography ""Seed Queen,"" a plush walleye, and a vintage ""Man of Action"" Jesse Ventura special ""Governor of Minnesota edition"" action figure. Or, have the book's creators write and illustrate a letter to the Minnesota mayor of your choice complaining about the potholes on your street.As its iconic bag makes an appearence in the book, Minnesota's own Duluth Pack has generously donated a few of its durable products to help make the book possible. There is either the official miniature #3 Duluth Pack (perfect for dolls or the Christmas tree) or several full size classic #51 Utility Canoe Packs. All, of course, include the book.There is the buy one, give one reward for the Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota's Wee Reads program which is really two rewards. And last but not least, we are lucky enough to be offering a limited number of opportunities to have Garrison Keillor personalize a copy of the book for a child you know.

ABOUT THE AUTHORS 
BROTHERS, we were born and raised on one of those Midwest family dairy farms that hardly exist anymore. We grew up in profound sincerity, milking cows and listening to Garrison Keillor and longing for the day when we could leave. And we did. Then something changed. We don't milk cows anymore and when we listen to Garrison Keillor it's a little less sincerely. But we've come to value regional personality, especially what it means to be from a place. We think this book is an excellent characterization of our life philosophy: Copy other ideas. Wait, no. We mean that everyone should value connecting with others on a single, shared level while at the same time staying proudly particular in ways those others might not understand.   Abe Sauer lives in Minnesota and Wisconsin and is the author of, in addition to other things, the book of humor ""How to be: NORTH DAKOTA.

<br/><br/><br/>This is it. We’re in what Bucky Fuller
labeled “humanity’s final examination,” and we must each answer the cosmic question
he often posed,
<br/><br/>
“Are humans a worthwhile to Universe experiment?”
<br/><br/>
The purpose of this project is to help us answer “yes” and create a sustainable,
peaceful, abundant life for all people and life on the fragile planet
Bucky called Spaceship Earth.
<br/><br/>
I’m asking you to help us fund this very important piece of the global success puzzle.I’m asking you to financially support my new book <i>""A Fuller View</i> so that it can reach the most
people in the shortest amount of time because time is critical to our survival and success as a species.  My first Bucky Fuller book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Buckminster-Fullers-Universe-Life-Work/dp/0738203793/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""""><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;""><font color=""#0000ff"">Buckminster Fuller's Universe</font></span></a> has made a difference to thousands of people, but we now need to make Bucky's wisdom and solutions even more available.

Bucky said, ""Love is metaphysical gravity.""  I agree.  What else could it be? 
Without gravity you would float like an astronaut in a spacecraft.  Up and down 
would mean nothing to you.  … Without love the same thing happens.  Every experience 
of anger, jealousy, resentment, and fear sends you spinning out of control.
<br/><br/><b>By John Robbins</b><br/>
The innocence of young people is not a fault to be corrected, nor an ignorance 
to be educated, but a strength to be celebrated.  Sometimes it takes courage to be 
innocent.  Sometimes the truly daring thing to do is to be naive.  Bucky's words remind 
me that my cynicism can be a trap, that my suspiciousness and defensiveness and 
know-it-all-ness can blind me, can keep me from awe, wonder and amazement.<br/><br/>
Of course it is our task to guide our children so that they may live with respect 
for themselves and respect for others.  But Bucky reminds us that our function is never 
to seek to impose our limited and limiting  beliefs upon them, but rather to help them 
to develop so they may give the gifts they are here to give, and to receive the gifts 
that others have for them, as well.<br/><br/>

both difficult and enjoyable at the same time.<br/><br/><b>By Kevin J. Todeschi</b><br/>
As a longtime resource on the Edgar Cayce information, I would have to say that my favorite 
Bucky quote is the one-line in which he states, ""I am a passenger on the spaceship Earth.""

of possibilities and truths about the nature of humankind and the interconnectedness of the 
entire human family.<br/><br/>

Selfishness is unnecessary. War is obsolete. It is a mater of converting the high technology from weaponry to livingry.”""Humanity is taking its final examination.  We have come to an extraordinary moment when it doesn't have to be you or me.  There is enough for all.  We need not operate competitively any longer.  If we succeed, it will be because of youth, truth and love."" - Dr. R. Buckminster Fuller
This is it. We’re in what Bucky Fuller
labeled “humanity’s final examination,” and we must each answer the cosmic question
he often posed,

“Are humans a worthwhile to Universe experiment?”

The purpose of this project is to help us answer “yes” and create a sustainable,
peaceful, abundant life for all people and life on the fragile planet
Bucky called Spaceship Earth.

I’m asking you to help us fund this very important piece of the global success puzzle.I’m asking you to financially support my new book ""A Fuller View so that it can reach the most
people in the shortest amount of time because time is critical to our survival and success as a species.  My first Bucky Fuller book Buckminster Fuller's Universe has made a difference to thousands of people, but we now need to make Bucky's wisdom and solutions even more available.

US Pavilion at the 1976 Montreal World's Fair.This SkyBreak Geodesic Dome designed by Bucky Fuller was the top attraction at the Fair and became known as his Taj Majal Masterpiece.


This initiative is designed to be the spark that brings Fuller and his wisdom back into the public spotlight so that we can all live lives filled with peace, joy and love. It is not some
pie-in-the-sky vision. The book A Fuller View and the initiatives surrounding it will educate people to the fact that there is enough to support all life and that war and selfishness are now obsolete.

This was not something that could have been known or experienced by our parents or grandparents. This is a new phenomenon, and we have to accept our responsibility as stewards of Spaceship
Earth and begin taking action on behalf of all sentient beings.
“The most important thing about Spaceship Earth - an instruction book didn't come with it.”  - Bucky FullerWe’re all in this together, and Fuller was one of the first people to recognize our plight.  He also realized that we humans don’t have a clue as to how to operate our tiny,  fragile Spaceship Earth, and he wrote the classic “Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth” to help people more fully appreciate what is needed to create a sustainable environment that supports all life on Earth.This project returns Fuller’s vision of  “A World That Works for Everyone” and the simple solutions he posed into the public spotlight.   This is extremely important as we teeter on the brink of destroying much of the life on Earth as well as the sustainability of our environment.“There is something patently insane about all the typewriters sleeping with all the beautiful plumbing in the beautiful office buildings -- and all the people sleeping in the slums.” - Bucky FullerLong before most of us woke up to the fact that we’re living in a crazy culture where there are plenty of resources to house machinery and to create more and more weaponry, Bucky was championing the importance of “livingry” - things that support life.  Today, this is an even more critical distinction to make, and this project will educate people on resource allocation and how we can be a species that successfully stewards our planet for the benefit of all.I have studied, written and spoken about Bucky’s vision since 1979, and I find it to hold the best solution to all humankind’s problems.  I know it to be useful in my life and the lives of many others.  Now is the critical moment when we need this vision of a positive, sustainable future more than ever, and your financial contribution will help make Bucky’s inspirational perspective more known and visible.The first major tool in this work is my new Bucky Fuller book A Fuller View - Exploring Bucky Fuller's Vision of Hope & Abundance for All to be published by Divine Arts Media in March 2012.  In addition to dozens of essential Bucky Fuller quotes and my writing, the book contains commentaries by luminaries including ·    Gary Zukav - Author - Seat of the Soul - Spiritual Partnership -The Dancing Wu Li Masters·    John Robbins - Author - Diet for a New America - The New Good Life·    Dr. Jean Houston - Author - Mind Games & A Mythic Life & The Search for the Beloved ·    Dr. Joel Levey - co-author ""Wisdom at Work"" & ""Living in Balance""·    Michelle Levey - co-author ""Wisdom at Work"" & ""Living in Balance""·    Barbara Marx Hubbard - Founder of the Foundation for Conscious Evolution·    Dr. Rick Ingrasci - Co-founder of Interface, American Holistic Medical Association, Hollyhock·    Dr. Hazel Henderson - Founder of Ethical Markets Media·    Ocean Robbins - Founder of YES!·    Peter Meisen - Founder of the Global Energy Network Institute (GENI)·    Ann Medlock - Founder & Director of The Giraffe Project·    David Spangler - Author of Blessing: The Art and the Practice & Coming Home·    Bobbi DePorter - Founder and CEO of SuperCamp·    Justine Toms - Co-Founder and Director of New Dimensions Radio·    Kevin Todeschi - Executive Director and CEO of Edgar Cayce’s A.R.E.·    Ross Quinn - Facilitator Lifestream; Author - The Love Based Leader·    Jamal Rahman - Muslim Sufi Minister, Cominister Interfaith Community Church·    Medard Gable - CEO, Big Picture Small World·    Michael Wiese - Filmmaker, Author - The Independent Film & Videomaker's Guide

Bucky's 1933 Dymaxion Vehicle.
3 prototypes built. Seated 11, got 30 plus miles per gallon
top speed 120 plus mph. Could easily be parked in a space
just 3 inches longer than the vehicle itself. The car we need
today produced 1933.

A Fuller View is compact guide outlining how we can quickly create a global “you and me” society of cooperation and peace to replace our “you or me” competitive culture of war and domination.  It also plots a course for readers to discover their true gifts and passions and freely contribute them to others.My first Bucky book Buckminster Fuller’s Universe provides a more comprehensive yet very readable examination of Fuller, his life and wisdom.  It was written in response to people seeking an easy to understand doorway to Bucky.
Here’s what some people said about Buckminster Fuller’s Universe:
""Buckminster Fuller was a great man.  Everybody concerned about the planet should read this book.  It fully illustrates that a great man walked among us.""     Larry King""Buckminster Fuller's genius and vision are more relevant than ever before.  Bucky's whole systems view is crucial to the future of humanity and the planet, and Steven Sieden brings his wisdom to life in Buckminster Fuller's Universe.

Who is Bucky Fuller, and why is he important now?
    In 1927 Bucky Fuller was an alcoholic contemplating suicide.  Instead of ending his life, he turned it into a personal experiment to determine and document what one individual could accomplish that could not be achieved by any government, corporation, religion or other institution no matter how rich or powerful.  Bucky’s experiment lasted for 56 years until his death in 1983.  During that period he was recognized as an inventor, futurist, educator, philosopher architect and global visionary.  
Bucky Fuller was often said to be “busy as a beaver.”
This uniquecover from a 1976 programillustrates that characteristic.

He also generated an income of more than one million dollars per year during the early 1950s while remaining true to his commitment to never work for a living.  He was known as ""Grandfather of the Universe,"" a title which acknowledges the magnitude of his wisdom and contribution.Conducting an experiment without follow-up and analysis leaves an enormous void.  The true value of Fuller's experiment cannot be manifest until others learn from it and apply his findings to their lives.Throughout his life, Fuller constantly analyzed his actions to determine what worked well and what was less than useful.  I have now explored and interpreted the entirety of Fuller's life and work so that I can provide deeper insights into his well-documented experiment using books, online recordings and live speeches.Please join me in this most important project.  Our planet and our species are depending on us to educate and inspire people to take action.“We are on a spaceship; a beautiful one.

statements.  Picking one is like being asked to choose one's favorite food amongst a buffet 
of culinary delights where each item has its own unique flavor and attraction.  It's a task 
both difficult and enjoyable at the same time.By Kevin J. Todeschi
As a longtime resource on the Edgar Cayce information, I would have to say that my favorite 
Bucky quote is the one-line in which he states, ""I am a passenger on the spaceship Earth."" 
Although it can certainly be seen by some as a simple statement, for me it embodies a rich array 
of possibilities and truths about the nature of humankind and the interconnectedness of the 
entire human family.


Here’s how we’re planning to use your generous contributions to create Bucky's vision of ""a world that works for everyone"":

<p>Our mission is to share the South Sound's rich literary talent as well as to foster relationships built upon mutual admiration of the written word.</p>
<p>Creative Colloquy is a submission based literary site with a focus on Tacoma and South Sound scribes paying special attention to writers of short stories, essays, and excerpts of novels. <br/></p>
<p>“Colloquy” by definition means to pow-wow, or to open up a dialogue. Monthly reading/open mic events play an instrumental part of that. Created in February 2014, Creative Colloquy was born from the desire to create a platform for writers to share their work and build relationships with those of like minds. Writing is typically something done as an isolated individual but connecting with those who understand the process can be inspiring and necessary to the creative process.<br/></p>

<li>Cover design, visual direction (commercial), etc. We've constructed a team of fabulous creative individuals. A portion of the funds raised will go to monetarily compensate these people for their efforts. </li>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">The truth is . . . <strong>I'm on a mission</strong>.  My mission started about 4 years ago after realizing that I had been listening to every word ""society"" had taught me over the previous 32 years.  </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><em><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">I'm not good enough.</span></em></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">""Society"" could include parents, friends, teachers, church community, magazines, television, etc.  Society is everything around us and the messages that are coming to us is that we need to look or act a certain way and have certain things in order to be ""good enough"".  </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">The truth is the fact that I was BORN is enough.  <strong>The fact that I made it into this world means that I have a REASON for being here. </strong> I've been given this gift of life and so have you.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">My mission is to spread the message that society has it all wrong.  Fortunately, the message is starting to shift and there are great people doing great things to spread the message - that you are great!  Unfortunately, society (typically) has more money and more ad power and is therefore, ultimately sharing a message that we can't live up to.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">That's why I'm coming to you!  I believe that you understand the pressures what it's like to grow up feeling like you aren't good enough:</span></p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">no matter how much weight you lose, you still feel fat</span></li>
<li class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">you don't have the ""right"" clothes or the ""right"" friends</span></li>
<li class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">you look at yourself in the mirror and hate the face you see</span></li>
<li class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">secretly you feel so much pressure to fit in, and instead don't belong</span></li>
<li class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">you might feel obligated to give up your dream so you can be ""normal""</span></li>
<li class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">whatever you do, you can't seem to do it well enough</span></li>
<li class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">add in your own ways you've felt ""not good enough""</span></li>
</ul><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';""><br/> What I've found over the past 4 years as a coach is that teens that feel these things grow up to be adults that still feel like they're not good enough but have learned how to ""cover it up"".  </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 24.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">A girl (Me) on a mission to share the message (You = Gift).</span></strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';""><strong><span style=""font-size: 24.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">Campaign basics...<br/></span></strong></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">You're asking the question, ""So what is it <em>exactly</em> that I'm supporting?""  When you support me and this campaign, you'll be supporting the publishing of an amazing book with amazing resources.  <br/></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">The writing, creating, and publishing of this book shall not rest on society deeming it worthy.  Instead, I'm saying forget about society and let's get this message out -- NOW!!</span></strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';""><strong><span style=""font-size: 24.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">About Jen...</span></strong></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">If you ask me the short version - I am a motivational speaker for the youth industry (especially young women).  Why?  Simple.  Society has taught us that we need to be a certain way, look a certain way, act a certain way, etc. in order to be good enough.  Most of a look for a <em>reason</em> in order to be good enough.  Most of us aren't taught that the fact that we are here IS enough.  I'm tired of what society is teaching and I'm sharing my voice (through speaking AND writing this book) with others so they can step into the life they are meant for.  And, it's meant for all of us, not just some of us!</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 24.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">Why Jen?</span></strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><em><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">In The Beginning</span></em></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">May 7, 2009 - A day that I will forever remember.  For the first time in my life I was told, <strong><em>""You are born into greatness.  The fact that you are here is enough.""  </em></strong></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><em><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">I Always Knew</span></em></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">I remember when I was younger I was always searching and wondering what it is I'm meant to do.  I remember knowing as a young girl that I had a <strong>purpose</strong>.  I was meant for <em>something wonderful</em>.  I also remember searching and seeking, never to find what this ""thing"" was.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">I always knew that I was meant to <strong>HELP OTHERS</strong>, I just didn't know how.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">When I was 32 years old, my life started to change.  That day, back in May of 2009, when I was told I was enough, I finally started believing it.  Unlike the perception, I haven't always felt confident and comfortable in my own skin.  For 32 years I held tightly to knowing ""I'm not good enough, people don't like me, so why even bother.""</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">The truth is that . . . <strong><em>I am amazing</em></strong>.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">And so are YOU!</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">I was in some of my darkest times as a teen and in my early 20's.  I know what it's like to be scared and uncertain, confused and overwhelmed.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 24.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">Why This Campaign? </span></strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">Simple answer:  I broke a board.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">Not-so-simple answer:  Friday, July 17, 2009 - the second day I will forever remember.  I remember knowing that if MY board broke, life would change.  I also remember knowing that it didn't matter because MY board would <em>NEVER</em> break.  Oh how I wanted to believe that I was enough.  </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">The little girl inside of me <strong><em>KNEW</em></strong> that I was enough.  <strong>In fact, she had known all along.</strong></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">Me, my ""adult self"" had let go of this knowing.  You see, we come into this life with an awe, an understanding, a recognition that we have a gift to offer the world.  And then somewhere along our journey, typically as teenagers, that understanding and recognition goes away and is replaced by society and the judgments that come along with it.  Now, in this moment I was back to wanting to believe it, but didn't know how.  The board was my symbol.  IF it broke, I KNEW my life would change.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">It took three tries.</span></strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">My board broke.</span></strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">Over the next 2 days I had grasped that if I had felt this way my entire adult life and possibly longer, then it's likely that others also feel this way.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">So, I did what everyone does at this point and <strong><em>I created an experiment</em></strong>.  I gave myself 3 months to shift my perspective, change my thinking, and watch my new life unfold.  If it changed, I'd drop everything I was doing, let go of my career, quit my job, and start a business supporting others.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><em><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">Can you guess what happened?</span></em></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 24.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">Why Now?</span></strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">After 4 years of my grass roots efforts and spreading the message, it's time to take it further.  </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">This campaign is important because the message is still missing from everyday conversation.  This campaign is important because everywhere I go, when I share these words people are still shocked to think they could be true for them.  This campaign is important for the hundreds of thousands that still don't realize they are a gift and that they've been uniquely designed and divinely created for something spectacular!!</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><strong><em><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">The question isn't whether or not you'll have an impact.  The question is what kind of an impact will you have?</span></em></strong><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">  </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">Ask yourself that question and then please, choose to join me on this mission.  We've been given one amazing life - this isn't a practice run.  This is it.  Help me spread the message that your life is your gift and we need to stand up and CHOOSE to live!</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"">Ultimately, in the end, of course I hope you are able to financially support this mission.  However, if you aren't, I'd still love to hear from you.  Please share this with others, reach out, connect with me, comment below, send a pony express.  I absolutely LOVE connecting with others and look forward to hearing from you too!</span></p>

I'm on a mission.  My mission started about 4 years ago after realizing that I had been listening to every word ""society"" had taught me over the previous 32 years.  
I'm not good enough.
""Society"" could include parents, friends, teachers, church community, magazines, television, etc.  Society is everything around us and the messages that are coming to us is that we need to look or act a certain way and have certain things in order to be ""good enough"".  
The truth is the fact that I was BORN is enough.  The fact that I made it into this world means that I have a REASON for being here.  I've been given this gift of life and so have you.
My mission is to spread the message that society has it all wrong.  Fortunately, the message is starting to shift and there are great people doing great things to spread the message - that you are great!  Unfortunately, society (typically) has more money and more ad power and is therefore, ultimately sharing a message that we can't live up to.
That's why I'm coming to you!  I believe that you understand the pressures what it's like to grow up feeling like you aren't good enough:

no matter how much weight you lose, you still feel fat
you don't have the ""right"" clothes or the ""right"" friends
you look at yourself in the mirror and hate the face you see
secretly you feel so much pressure to fit in, and instead don't belong
you might feel obligated to give up your dream so you can be ""normal""
whatever you do, you can't seem to do it well enough
add in your own ways you've felt ""not good enough""
 What I've found over the past 4 years as a coach is that teens that feel these things grow up to be adults that still feel like they're not good enough but have learned how to ""cover it up"".  
A girl (Me) on a mission to share the message (You = Gift).
Campaign basics...
You're asking the question, ""So what is it exactly that I'm supporting?""  When you support me and this campaign, you'll be supporting the publishing of an amazing book with amazing resources.  
The writing, creating, and publishing of this book shall not rest on society deeming it worthy.  Instead, I'm saying forget about society and let's get this message out -- NOW!!
About Jen...
If you ask me the short version - I am a motivational speaker for the youth industry (especially young women).  Why?  Simple.  Society has taught us that we need to be a certain way, look a certain way, act a certain way, etc. in order to be good enough.  Most of a look for a reason in order to be good enough.  Most of us aren't taught that the fact that we are here IS enough.  I'm tired of what society is teaching and I'm sharing my voice (through speaking AND writing this book) with others so they can step into the life they are meant for.  And, it's meant for all of us, not just some of us!
Why Jen?
In The Beginning
May 7, 2009 - A day that I will forever remember.  For the first time in my life I was told, ""You are born into greatness.  The fact that you are here is enough.""  
I Always Knew
I remember when I was younger I was always searching and wondering what it is I'm meant to do.  I remember knowing as a young girl that I had a purpose.  I was meant for something wonderful.  I also remember searching and seeking, never to find what this ""thing"" was.
I always knew that I was meant to HELP OTHERS, I just didn't know how.
When I was 32 years old, my life started to change.  That day, back in May of 2009, when I was told I was enough, I finally started believing it.  Unlike the perception, I haven't always felt confident and comfortable in my own skin.  For 32 years I held tightly to knowing ""I'm not good enough, people don't like me, so why even bother.""
The truth is that . . . I am amazing.
And so are YOU!
I was in some of my darkest times as a teen and in my early 20's.  I know what it's like to be scared and uncertain, confused and overwhelmed.
Why This Campaign? 
Simple answer:  I broke a board.
Not-so-simple answer:  Friday, July 17, 2009 - the second day I will forever remember.  I remember knowing that if MY board broke, life would change.  I also remember knowing that it didn't matter because MY board would NEVER break.  Oh how I wanted to believe that I was enough.  
The little girl inside of me KNEW that I was enough.  In fact, she had known all along.
Me, my ""adult self"" had let go of this knowing.  You see, we come into this life with an awe, an understanding, a recognition that we have a gift to offer the world.  And then somewhere along our journey, typically as teenagers, that understanding and recognition goes away and is replaced by society and the judgments that come along with it.  Now, in this moment I was back to wanting to believe it, but didn't know how.  The board was my symbol.  IF it broke, I KNEW my life would change.
It took three tries.
My board broke.
Over the next 2 days I had grasped that if I had felt this way my entire adult life and possibly longer, then it's likely that others also feel this way.
So, I did what everyone does at this point and I created an experiment.  I gave myself 3 months to shift my perspective, change my thinking, and watch my new life unfold.  If it changed, I'd drop everything I was doing, let go of my career, quit my job, and start a business supporting others.
Can you guess what happened?
Why Now?
After 4 years of my grass roots efforts and spreading the message, it's time to take it further.  
This campaign is important because the message is still missing from everyday conversation.  This campaign is important because everywhere I go, when I share these words people are still shocked to think they could be true for them.  This campaign is important for the hundreds of thousands that still don't realize they are a gift and that they've been uniquely designed and divinely created for something spectacular!!
The question isn't whether or not you'll have an impact.  The question is what kind of an impact will you have?  
Ask yourself that question and then please, choose to join me on this mission.  We've been given one amazing life - this isn't a practice run.  This is it.  Help me spread the message that your life is your gift and we need to stand up and CHOOSE to live!
Ultimately, in the end, of course I hope you are able to financially support this mission.  However, if you aren't, I'd still love to hear from you.  Please share this with others, reach out, connect with me, comment below, send a pony express.  I absolutely LOVE connecting with others and look forward to hearing from you too!
Make a Difference . . . Lead with Love Jen xoxoP.S. (Can I have a post script in a campaign? - Yes, since I'm making my rules!)
If you care to hear (duh, that means read) from some lives that have already been touched by my words, keep reading . . .
“This type of message (of worth and value, knowing you are a Gift) is important for everyone to hear. It is amazing to see the looks on the girls’ faces when it all starts to make sense. I always feel refreshed and inspired when I leave Jennifer's presentation.” ~ Holly
“Jen was PERFECT.In the beginning Jen said that she believed she was meant to do this, and I am 100% positive that she is on this Earth to help everyday girls get through this crazy life with a smile on their face.” ~ Courtney
“After just one conversation with Jennifer I felt an extra lightness in my heart and peace in my mind.  It was a conversation I really wanted to have for a long time.  Jennifer was absolutely perfect in her words, direction and insights.  She is a gift to others!” ~ Margery
“Jennifer was my first presenter in my company’s “Live Your Best Life” series and let’s just say she’s been a hard one to follow…I would highly recommend Jennifer for any speaking engagement” ~ Katy
You've Made It This Far
First, I want to start by thanking you for taking time to learn more about me, my journey, and this campaign.   I'm so grateful and appreciative!  
Second, I want my perks to be beneficial for you.  If you would like to donate, but the perks don't seem to match your desires, please reach out and connect with me.  I want them to make sense for you and I'm confident we can find something that will work!
Third and lastly, thank you again.  Thanking you is one of the most important things to me (second only to the desire that you know you're amazing!).  I am truly humbled and grateful to be on this journey and having you join me!
What risks and challenges might I run into?
The biggest challenge will be coordinating the personal call/skype conferencing along with travel plans for personal delivery, presentation/speaking engagements. However, with that being said, since I always lead my life with love, and since you're joining me, I'm guessing you want to as well, we'll definitely find a way to make it work!
Additionally, I'm a very open, candid, and vulnerably sharing person...so, you'll be in on every step of this journey. I'm excited to share with you - good, bad, or indifferent!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

behalf of theTransnational Feminist Union in Mexico!            

We are enthused to announce our Feminist Drive campaign in the founding year of our emerging
     feminist labor organization, The Transnational Feminist Union,
 uniting anti-sexist capital to cover some of the utmost crucial 
costs of deconstruing patriarchy & systemic violence in 2015. #TransFemmeDrive!   The vision of united transnational feminist labor is ""rooted from our 
concrete reality & simultaneously imagines possibilities beyond this 
reality. It is a radical dream of revolutionary political mass movement 
that in its reformist stage grants women civil rights within the 
existing imperialist, white supremacist, capitalist, patriarchal system 
while simultaneously working to undermine and overthrow
 that system. The feminist dream of replacing the culture of domination 
with a world of participatory economics grounded in communalism & 
social democracy, a world without discrimination based on race or 
gender, a world where recognition of mutuality & interdependency can 
be the dominant ethos, a global ecological vision of how the planet can 
survive & how everyone on it can have access to peace & well-being""  ~ bell hooks, Feminism is For Everybody #VisionaryFeminism        Liberally, our mission is to unite & expand feminist work & research in all
sectors of the economy, culture & political structures from a
transnational, eco-working class approach. Some of our core central goals include gender inclusive domestic labor policy remunerations, reaching
economic settlements for current unpaid domestic labor, fair wages
for house work & backpay for our mothers, grandmothers & all our ancestral
unpaid domestic labor. Integrate women & gender studies in public
school curricula & amongst
grassroots coalitions. Implement transnational gender justice programs, prioritizing
the needs of the most vulnerable in our global community, cultivate autonomous
eco-feminism & advocate for the worldwide decriminalization 
of reproductive
justice, including for our universal right to choose abortion. Contest 
the mainstream racist & rape
culture media, forming feminist think tanks, town hall conferences &
 promulgating alternative
online feminist media content. As well as continue to embolden & 
develop inclusive
grassroots awareness campaigns & networks to end DV, incest & 
child abuse
worldwide through preventative, community based solutions that educate 
for healthy
interpersonal relationships across generations & connect the 
community with feminist resources or services available. Apply, radiate,
 advance & innovate transnational feminist grassroots research, 
media,
community education, resources, services & libratory 
praxis. #RestorativeJustice #ReproductiveJusticeUNION TRANSNACIONAL FEMINISTA, TRANSNATIONAL FEMINIST UNION, 2015 FOUNDING YEAR AGENDA:
 Our agenda is shaping up as follows yet unless 
specified otherwise this, as all Union publications, is a working draft.
 * Establish location of the Los Angeles
development local; move to new office local.
* Publish work in process,  #BlackLivesMatter #WeGotYouSis   ""The Intersectionality of State Sanctioned Police Brutality & DomesticViolence""  *Solidify Union Council Mission & Vision, Demands & Agenda  (2015-2016)Whereas
Worldwide:
  - Every year 60 million girls are sexually assaulted at or on
their way to school. 
  - 1-3 women have been beaten or sexually abused in their lifetime. - At least 60 million girls are missing form their populations-
mostly in Asia as        a  result of infanticide or sex related abortion.  - Women and Girls are 80% of 640,000 of the
estimated 800,000 trafficked    across national borders annually with the majority
505,600 being trafficked         for sexual exploitation.
  - In some parts of the world girls are more likely to be raped
than to learn  
    how to read.  
  - Over 60 million girls worldwide are child brides, 31.3 million

pregnant, 50% of  
    physically abused Indian women reported being abused
while pregnant

subjected to Female  
    Genital Mutilation. In 6 African countries 80% of
women have been subjected 
    to this torture. (United Nations Statistics)  
  A womanist/feminist transnational

Our Feminist Drive Campaign, has a foundational monetary goal of 
$30,000,  covering the utmost crucial, project
development outlays in the labor union’s inceptional 
year. A major potential
 strategy for reaching our final budget goal is for 30 fabulous 
femmefolk to donate
$300 & for each of these same 30 femfolk to unite 2 matching legacy 
council
member pledges in hopes of surpassing perhaps, the $30,000 foundational 
budget! Our legacy donors have the option of receiving a signed 
copy
of founding council member Tania Xothi Tellez's first book,  ""Praxis: Feminist 
Liberation Theory"", either at
our publishing event or by mail. Legacy founding council membership to 
the Transnational
Feminist Union itself, & fabulous Moringa Oleifera seeds for
harvesting the most nutritive, self-seeding veggy on the planet, today. #Sovereignty #DecolonizetCity

 Basic founding Union membership is a small $25
contribution, moreover, contributors always have the option of giving anonymously, any amount and without claiming a
perk. If 1,000 of us join
the union at basic membership level we will have reached our goal,
can we find 1,000 feminist to join in support our initiatives for a
feminist society?
Conversely, however, please keep in mind the potential strategy of  donating 300$ & affiliating 2 additional femmefolk
to match your gift amount within the incoming days
of the campaign. Needless to say no donation is too big or too small. We
 urge you to give as BIG as you can afford, for ALL CONTRIBUTIONS ARE 
KEY! Visit us on FB & Twitter, #TransFemDrive & share this momentous councilship call-to-action as widely possible. Can
we count on your $300 foundational councilship pledge & on your commitment to
unite 2 additional matching legacy council member pledges to secure
 the foundation of our Transnational Eco-Feminist Labor Union!?

<p>""Laser, quick, go around through the other rooms and come back down the hall towards me. If there is something there you will push it right to me.""</p>
<p> </p>
<p>""By myself?""</p>
<p> </p>
<p>""Of course!  Don't worry, I am right here, you can do it."" Encouraged Doodlebug.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>""Okay... I guess I can do it...""</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Laser crept out of the hall, barely breathing and listening for any tiny sound with his sensitive ears.  Each step he took meant going further out of sight of his sister and further into the darkness. Every inch of his body was tense and waiting for something to jump out at him.  He felt like a helpless little gazelle walking through a lion’s den.  He was sure his pounding heart was loud enough to wake those lions and cause them to attack... except these weren't real lions, these weren't even... alive.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thu-thump, thu-thump, no matter how careful he was to walk as quiet as possible... his steps seemed so loud that they echoed through the empty room.  Or was it empty?  Laser froze.  Did something in the corner of the room just move?  He drew in a slow, quivering, breath as he kept his eyes fixed on that corner. Nothing; must have been his imagination.  He took a few more steps, towards a door that separated two rooms.  On the far end of the second room was another door that opened back out into the hall at the opposite end from Doodlebug.  If anything was haunting this basement then hopefully Laser would push it back towards Doodlebug, or Bugs as he called her.  Just one more room beyond this door and he would be at the far end of the hall from his sister, able to see her again; feel safe again.  She is always so brave; he wished he could be more like her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ahead the next stretch through the second room was going to be tough, ""<em>How does she always talk me into doing these things?""</em> he thought to himself realizing that this wasn't the first time, and it wouldn't be the last that he would find himself creeping through the dark all by himself.  Not just place in the dark... a haunted place in the dark.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He paused in the doorway to the neighboring room steeling himself for enough courage to get through these last few yards of darkness.  A much darker and ominous stretch between him and the safety of the hallway, ""<em>I can creep through here and slowly and take more time, or I can go through with determination and get to that hallway faster""</em> he weighed out his options.  It didn't take long to decide that the latter, go with determination, was the answer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He doubled his speed and stopped caring about walking quietly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>""What was that?"" He said out loud to the air.  He could have sworn he heard a noise to his left, but he couldn't see anything. Just a few more steps to the hallway…  Laser lowered his head and soldiered through until he could see the warm red glow of his sisters’ flashlight hanging around her neck.  The red light helped keep their eyes adjusted to the dark.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Mari Chastain.  I have always been in love with the mystery of the paranormal since I was a child. I remember bringing book after book about “true stories of hauntings” home from my elementary school library and scaring myself so badly that I would lay in bed and shiver myself to sleep. My mother quickly forbade me from bringing any of those books home, so I resorted to reading them in the library during every free minute I had… until I actually ran out (what can I say, it was a small elementary school library)! As a child I would never just walk up to my bed, but take a flying leap from the edge of the room onto my bed so that the monsters and ghouls under my bed couldn't grab my ankles. This was only a relevant exercise at night, mind you; I was monster and ghoul immune during the day. I also practiced the ritual of making sure all stuffed animals were under the covers with me, if they were on top of the covers the ghosts could scare them and steal them. If they were under the covers somehow they could protect me from ghosts. I fell into ghost hunting in late 2008. Once I dove down the paranormal rabbit hole I was hooked! I have not looked back and the paranormal has been my passion ever since.</p>
<p>Several years ago I had gotten the idea to write children’s stories that I could send to my niece, Ady. A little something we could share as we live on opposite sides of the country. She fell in love with Doodlebug and Laser when she met them, and the idea of mixing her little friends with my passion was hatched. The original story and additional ideas for further stories kept growing in my mind. I guess they just ran out of room up there because one day, I just started writing, and didn't stop until the first book was 3/4 finished! Upon completing the first book I read what I had put onto paper and I liked it. I felt that it was time to see what I could do with self publishing.</p>
<p>That brings me to indiegogo.com, a wonderful tool to help me launch this project. I hope you are interested in this project, and most of all, I hope my stories bring you and your loved ones joy!</p>
<p><strong>About my project:</strong></p>
<p><span>Doodlebug and Laser; Ghost Hunters is a line of children’s books. They are designed to entertain as well as teach children that not everything that “goes bump in the night” is harmful or scary.</span></p>
<div> </div>
<div>Doodlebug and Laser live in a close knit community, and help their fellow neighbors (human and furry alike) whenever they think there may be a haunting. Doodlebug is fearless and dives right in to every mystery, while Laser is apprehensive and deals with dark spooky places scaring him. In real life Laser has Lupus, so I have chosen to integrate that into the stories as well.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>For the most part, they might just save the day or learn a valuable lesson, but you never know… they may just run into something they can’t explain here and there!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thank You,</div>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>For my project I have extrapolated the costs to launch this endeavor:</div>
<p>- Publishing services (self publishing to save on costs) and set up fees.</p>
<p>- Publishing books for sale at Phenomenology 105 and other conferences.  This cost will vary based on the number of illustrations myself and Howie agree on.</p>
<div>- Banners and Marketing materials</div>
<div> </div>
<div>- Illustrations, I am getting quotes from:</div>

Thu-thump, thu-thump, no matter how careful he was to walk as quiet as possible... his steps seemed so loud that they echoed through the empty room.  Or was it empty?  Laser froze.  Did something in the corner of the room just move?  He drew in a slow, quivering, breath as he kept his eyes fixed on that corner. Nothing; must have been his imagination.  He took a few more steps, towards a door that separated two rooms.  On the far end of the second room was another door that opened back out into the hall at the opposite end from Doodlebug.  If anything was haunting this basement then hopefully Laser would push it back towards Doodlebug, or Bugs as he called her.  Just one more room beyond this door and he would be at the far end of the hall from his sister, able to see her again; feel safe again.  She is always so brave; he wished he could be more like her.
 
Ahead the next stretch through the second room was going to be tough, ""How does she always talk me into doing these things?"" he thought to himself realizing that this wasn't the first time, and it wouldn't be the last that he would find himself creeping through the dark all by himself.  Not just place in the dark... a haunted place in the dark.
 
He paused in the doorway to the neighboring room steeling himself for enough courage to get through these last few yards of darkness.  A much darker and ominous stretch between him and the safety of the hallway, ""I can creep through here and slowly and take more time, or I can go through with determination and get to that hallway faster"" he weighed out his options.  It didn't take long to decide that the latter, go with determination, was the answer.
 
He doubled his speed and stopped caring about walking quietly.
 
""What was that?"" He said out loud to the air.  He could have sworn he heard a noise to his left, but he couldn't see anything. Just a few more steps to the hallway…  Laser lowered his head and soldiered through until he could see the warm red glow of his sisters’ flashlight hanging around her neck.  The red light helped keep their eyes adjusted to the dark.
 
Short Summary
My name is Mari Chastain.  I have always been in love with the mystery of the paranormal since I was a child. I remember bringing book after book about “true stories of hauntings” home from my elementary school library and scaring myself so badly that I would lay in bed and shiver myself to sleep. My mother quickly forbade me from bringing any of those books home, so I resorted to reading them in the library during every free minute I had… until I actually ran out (what can I say, it was a small elementary school library)! As a child I would never just walk up to my bed, but take a flying leap from the edge of the room onto my bed so that the monsters and ghouls under my bed couldn't grab my ankles. This was only a relevant exercise at night, mind you; I was monster and ghoul immune during the day. I also practiced the ritual of making sure all stuffed animals were under the covers with me, if they were on top of the covers the ghosts could scare them and steal them. If they were under the covers somehow they could protect me from ghosts. I fell into ghost hunting in late 2008. Once I dove down the paranormal rabbit hole I was hooked! I have not looked back and the paranormal has been my passion ever since.
Several years ago I had gotten the idea to write children’s stories that I could send to my niece, Ady. A little something we could share as we live on opposite sides of the country. She fell in love with Doodlebug and Laser when she met them, and the idea of mixing her little friends with my passion was hatched. The original story and additional ideas for further stories kept growing in my mind. I guess they just ran out of room up there because one day, I just started writing, and didn't stop until the first book was 3/4 finished! Upon completing the first book I read what I had put onto paper and I liked it. I felt that it was time to see what I could do with self publishing.
That brings me to indiegogo.com, a wonderful tool to help me launch this project. I hope you are interested in this project, and most of all, I hope my stories bring you and your loved ones joy!
About my project:
Doodlebug and Laser; Ghost Hunters is a line of children’s books. They are designed to entertain as well as teach children that not everything that “goes bump in the night” is harmful or scary.
 
Doodlebug and Laser live in a close knit community, and help their fellow neighbors (human and furry alike) whenever they think there may be a haunting. Doodlebug is fearless and dives right in to every mystery, while Laser is apprehensive and deals with dark spooky places scaring him. In real life Laser has Lupus, so I have chosen to integrate that into the stories as well.  
 
For the most part, they might just save the day or learn a valuable lesson, but you never know… they may just run into something they can’t explain here and there!
 
Thank You,
Mari Chastain


What We Need & What You Get
For my project I have extrapolated the costs to launch this endeavor:
- Publishing services (self publishing to save on costs) and set up fees.
- Publishing books for sale at Phenomenology 105 and other conferences.  This cost will vary based on the number of illustrations myself and Howie agree on.
- Banners and Marketing materials
 
- Illustrations, I am getting quotes from:


Howie Noel - www.hcnoel.com

John Opal - www.opalgallery.com

G Patrick Teran - www.gpatrickteran.com



 
I am hoping indiegogo.com can help me with the initial investment for this project, but my intention is for the sales of this first book to fund the publishing of subsequent books.


Other Ways You Can Help

<p>Hey everyone! My name is Angie Underwood, a professional book designer and the creator of BookCreative – a program that allows writers and book professionals to create beautiful, high-quality books for print or e-book.<br/> </p>
<h3><strong>It all started when...</strong></h3>
<p>Back in 2006, I created a software program called BookCoverPro to fulfill a need for self-publishers who wanted (and deserved!) high-quality book cover design, but didn't have the budget to hire a professional. With that, I designed a library of cover templates so that even the most artistically-challenged could create stunning, high-quality book covers. My goal was to level the playing field so that anyone who worked hard at writing a book could have the same opportunity to get their books noticed and sold as those who had spent thousands on professional design. In the ten years since this program was available, we had tens of thousands of loyal users, many of whom used BCP for dozens of their titles. Several of our authors even won awards for their outstanding designs – <i>with no prior art experience!</i><br/> </p>
<p>Since then, I have developed many friendships with writers, along with a strong sense of respect and compassion for their work. I wanted to take the program even further by offering not only a platform to design covers, but also have a way to edit pages and create marketing materials. With this goal, I teamed up with skilled (<i>and very patient)</i> developers and, in December, launched the initial release of <strong>BookCreative</strong>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">ღ  ღ  ღ</p>
<p><a href=""http://bookcreative.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>BookCreative</strong></a> is a plug-and-go book design program that is both Mac + PC compatible and includes a robust platform for designing book covers, formatting pages, and building marketing media like bookmarks, brochures, postcards, DVD cases, and more. It even includes a built-in ISBN barcode generator, and formatting for PDF, JPG, PNG, GIF, + BMP.</p>

<h3>Some nice things about the program:</h3>
<ul>
<li>NOT subscription-based - this is a one-time cost, good forever.</li>
<li>NOT web-based, but a free-standing desktop app. <strong>There is never a risk of losing your info because of a site outage or being compromised by hacker sabotage. </strong>
</li>
<li>UNLIMITED titles + FREE updates.</li>
<li>ANY STYLE print book or e-book.</li>
<li>PRE-DESIGNED TEMPLATES and FREE images included with your Deluxe order.</li>
<li>Mac &amp; PC compatible.</li>
<li>Supports BookCoverPro files.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fast-forward to today...</h3>
<p>We have customers all over the world using BookCreative and with a lot of positive testimony, we've received some great suggestions – that we would now like to apply.</p>
<p>It's also time to upgrade BookCreative for better functionality – while still remaining easy to use and affordable. Here is what my team and I propose with this next level of development:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easier manipulation from Word or other editing programs</strong></li>
<li><strong>.EPUB &amp; .MOBI formatting</strong></li>
<li><strong>Instant, customizable 3D e-book cover conversions</strong></li>

<ul>
<li>Development costs</li>
<li>Quality Assurance testing</li>
<li>More unique templates and images for our users</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>
<br/>The Impact</h3>
<p>With indie publishers now accounting for <a href=""http://selfpublishingadvice.org/indie-authors-now-top-us-digital-book-sales)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">about 45% of all e-book sales</a> (2016), the playing field has certainly changed in the past decade. Self-publishers tend to be savvy and smart with a refined mindset, and they demand (and deserve) book design that reflects the same quality and professionalism as afforded to traditionally-published books.</p>
<p>BookCoverPro helped leverage this mindset by giving writers the power to design their own covers. BookCreative moves this forward by helping writers create their entire books that are stunning and sellable, and industry-correct for any device.</p>
<p>We believe that a writer should have complete control over their entire book—content AND design—because they know their book better than anyone else. We know the hard work that writers put into their product, and we want them to have the ability to create beautiful design, for <i>unlimited titles</i>, at a cost that is affordable—for anyone, all over the world.</p>
<p>And, we want to have a full library of cover and page design templates to use and customize. These have proven to be very popular with our users, and they help to leverage the design skills for those who are more ""artistically-challenged"".</p>
<p>As always, my professional team and I will continue to provide excellent service to all our customers. ツ<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have secured a devoted QA team and a selection of our own customers to beta test the app while in development and before launch to ensure proper functionality on all platforms and devices. After launch, my developers will remain on board to provide updates, zap any issues that arise, and continue to test UX functionality.</p>
<p><strong>If we do not meet our minimum funding:</strong> Any proceeds raised will go toward development costs and/or helping authors with their design and promotional needs. I promise, every penny will be put to good use with our services.</p>
<p><strong>Any funding in excess:</strong> Will be used to expand our reach with more services such as design workshops and courses–which we are <strong>super</strong> <strong>excited</strong> about. More on that when it happens!<br/> </p>
<h3>Perks &amp; ETA:</h3>
<p>Every contributor who chooses our SILVER, GOLD, PLATINUM, or VESTED perks will immediately receive a link to our current BookCreative program for download, and will receive our new release when ready.</p>
<p>If funding is met, development will commence right after campaign is complete, and we expect the timeframe for development and testing to take about 1-2 months. We will keep everyone up to date on this campaign page. <strong>Estimated date of launch: </strong>October 2017.<br/> </p>

<p>HRVST is not a music magazine. It ́s not about telling you how a new record sounds or how the tour of our favorite band went. Instead we “harvest“ experiences, ideas and stories of people from the DIY music and art scene and produce a magazine that focuses on their individual stories and experiences, shedding light on a very up and close personal level, building on a bigger, more complex and truthful picture of who they really are and what makes them the persons they are. Beyond the stage, beyond the canvas, beyond what you seem to know about them, already. In the end uniting them in one single topic per issue. Following the first issue “Death“, the second issue of HRVST focuses on the topic of “Youth“.</p>
<p><strong>HRVST</strong> is a book project that features various persons that have their roots in the underground / punk / hardcore environment. Be it painters, graphic artists, writers, musicians, photographers, label-guys, or whatnot. It´s not asking about the latest record or tour, or giving out record-reviews and stuff like that. Enough people do that, already, and they are probably better at it than we would. Instead we focus on one topic per issue, making this thing more timeless by featuring pure statements, opinions and stories of people that we think have something to say about a topic that is dear to us. Starting with the end, <strong>""Death""</strong> has been the topic for our premier issue.</p>
<h2><strong><br/>Why we are here. </strong></h2>
<p class=""mhl""><strong>HRVST #2 focuses on ""Youth"". It´s already finished but we need YOU to turn this into a printed reality so that you can hold it in your hands. </strong></p>
<p><strong>So we are sincerely hoping for your support to help us finance the printing process! If you can spare a couple of bucks, we would be more than happy to share some of the perks with you, in the last section of this page.   <br/><br/>Also, please check the various ways you can support us / inform your friends about us:</strong></p>

HRVST is not a music magazine. It ́s not about telling you how a new record sounds or how the tour of our favorite band went. Instead we “harvest“ experiences, ideas and stories of people from the DIY music and art scene and produce a magazine that focuses on their individual stories and experiences, shedding light on a very up and close personal level, building on a bigger, more complex and truthful picture of who they really are and what makes them the persons they are. Beyond the stage, beyond the canvas, beyond what you seem to know about them, already. In the end uniting them in one single topic per issue. Following the first issue “Death“, the second issue of HRVST focuses on the topic of “Youth“.
HRVST is a book project that features various persons that have their roots in the underground / punk / hardcore environment. Be it painters, graphic artists, writers, musicians, photographers, label-guys, or whatnot. It´s not asking about the latest record or tour, or giving out record-reviews and stuff like that. Enough people do that, already, and they are probably better at it than we would. Instead we focus on one topic per issue, making this thing more timeless by featuring pure statements, opinions and stories of people that we think have something to say about a topic that is dear to us. Starting with the end, ""Death"" has been the topic for our premier issue.
Why we are here. 
HRVST #2 focuses on ""Youth"". It´s already finished but we need YOU to turn this into a printed reality so that you can hold it in your hands. 
So we are sincerely hoping for your support to help us finance the printing process! If you can spare a couple of bucks, we would be more than happy to share some of the perks with you, in the last section of this page.   Also, please check the various ways you can support us / inform your friends about us:

<h3>Cracking Heaven's Mirror</h3>
<p>An ancient Persian text and oracle, Masonic ciphers, Angels and Demons, an Illuminati conspiracy, Nazi occultists and mystics retrieving it as a holy relic, the ability to see an hour or 1000 years into the future... sound like the latest Dan Brown novel?  Wrong.  This is true history and the document has been deciphered for the first time in over 200 years and will soon be available for YOU to have!:</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">I am an author, graphic pencil artist, and researcher/translator of Renaissance European texts. While studying a particular French author, a friend clued me into some engravings she had seen in a book. After much research I found the origin of the seven engravings. As I dug deeper into these mysterious engravings and the man behind them, it led me on a journey though Renaissance secret societies such as the Masons and Rosicrucian, Illuminati espionage, deep into occult and esoteric fields of thought.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">After trying to make sense of the text and seven engravings, it occurred to me that there were certain indicators on the engravings and oracular pieces; and what I was looking at was not the true text or oracle, but a system that had been scrambled by a cipher! I've meticulously found every cypher and am working on the translation of the original text from French into English.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">This ancient Persian tarot-like oracle is purported to give future predictions anywhere from minutes or hours into the future to epochs of over 1000 years! In its ciphered form, the oracle is useless, but now that I have the keys, I am working on getting French text translated into English for the first time in history, and also redrawing the engravings which are vital for the oracle to function. All will be compiled into an easy to follow book retracing the original author's steps (who died in a prison for treason), and also my steps as I take you through how the oracle was encoded and decrypted. Also included will be the translation of the original text, the deciphered oracle and everything you will need to start using this 1000+ year old secret system!</p>

<h3>¿Quiénes?</h3>
<p><strong>Tandaia </strong>es una joven editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el crowdfunding.</p>
<p>De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.</p>
<p>Hoy te presentamos a <strong>Belinda Mainar</strong>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Nacida el 18 de febrero de 1977, empezó a escribir a los ocho años en el diario que le regalaron por su primera comunión. Enamorada de los comics de sus hermanos mayores, aprendió a leer con <i>Zipi y Zape</i>, <i>13 Rue del Percebe</i> y <i>Mortadelo y Filemón</i>, abriéndose camino poco a poco a otras lecturas con menos viñetas.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Estando en el instituto ganó el concurso de poesía, participó en la revista del centro y el grupo de teatro eligió y representó una comedia con su firma. Tiempo después comenzó con los talleres literarios, primero en la Universidad Popular de Zaragoza, luego en la <i>Escuela de Escritores</i>, con profesores de la talla de Patricia Esteban Erlés, o el poeta y novelista Julio Espinosa Guerra.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Actualmente trabaja como administrativa y <i>Travel Manager</i> para una empresa de ingeniería y va a publicar su primera novela, <i>Portamento</i>.</p>
<h3>¿Cómo?</h3>
<p>Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 920€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cuarenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.</p>
<ul>
<li>Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.</li>
<li>Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.</li>
<li>Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.</li>
</ul>
<p>Los fondos recaudados, se utilizarán para sacar adelante esta primera edición de <strong>Portamento</strong> que saldría después a la venta.</p>
<h3>Además...</h3>
<p>Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona al autor, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y <strong>Belinda Mainar</strong> vea publicada su obra.<br/><br/>Gracias por vuestro tiempo.</p>

Hoy te presentamos a Belinda Mainar.
Nacida el 18 de febrero de 1977, empezó a escribir a los ocho años en el diario que le regalaron por su primera comunión. Enamorada de los comics de sus hermanos mayores, aprendió a leer con Zipi y Zape, 13 Rue del Percebe y Mortadelo y Filemón, abriéndose camino poco a poco a otras lecturas con menos viñetas.
Estando en el instituto ganó el concurso de poesía, participó en la revista del centro y el grupo de teatro eligió y representó una comedia con su firma. Tiempo después comenzó con los talleres literarios, primero en la Universidad Popular de Zaragoza, luego en la Escuela de Escritores, con profesores de la talla de Patricia Esteban Erlés, o el poeta y novelista Julio Espinosa Guerra.
Actualmente trabaja como administrativa y Travel Manager para una empresa de ingeniería y va a publicar su primera novela, Portamento.
¿Cómo?
Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 920€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cuarenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.

Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.
Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.
Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.

Los fondos recaudados, se utilizarán para sacar adelante esta primera edición de Portamento que saldría después a la venta.
Además...
Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona al autor, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y Belinda Mainar vea publicada su obra.Gracias por vuestro tiempo.",0.0,0,"228 Campaigns

<p>I was lucky enough to be selected to be one of the 8000 to initially explore the new Google Glass, and I thought, wouldn't it be cool if I chronicled my experiences using the product in an e-book that would be published shortly before Google Glass was released the general public? I would also maintain a blog, incorporating images and videos taken using Google Glass, then shortly before it is released to the public, flesh out the material into a full-length e-book (in the Kindle format) that would include additional thoughts and experiences unable to be documented by the Glass. Since the book would be primarily text (with some images), the blog would serve as a natural complement as it would contain all of the images and video clips taken. <br/><br/>As part of this adventure, I would also entertain suggestions from those who followed the blog to embark on novel experiences to be incorporated as events in the book (and share them online). As long as it wasn't illegal, immoral, unethical, dangerous, or unreasonable, I am pretty much up to anything. I also thought it would be fun to visit random people and document their daily routine (with their permission, of course) and incorporate them as featured characters in the book as well.</p>
<p>My biggest challenge is to never be boring, as I'm promising an entertaining ride that is essentially my life to become the narrative of the book. And since this is non-fiction, even though there might be temptation to ""enhance"" events to make them more exciting, my ethics would force me to remain honest. But that is where my viewers become a pivotal part of this process; by suggesting new adventures for me to embark upon, and maybe even becoming part of the story. Initially, only one person in 40,000 will have access to this new technology, so the inherent novelty will fascinate folks, but I will also face individuals who fear the potential abuses of this gadget, especially when it comes to privacy issues. I hope to serve as an ambassador of change, showing folks that in this day of social media, that we must embrace a new world of interconnectivity that spans across all cultures and unifies the globe.</p>
<p>While real life is unpredictable, I feel that I can document an entertaining journey with many unexpected twists that readers will not easily forget. Won't you be part of my trip into a brave new world of social interaction combined with the newest technological development? I'll see you on the other side of the glass.</p>

<p>An excerpt from the book:<br/><br/><span>Privacy, privacy, privacy . . . that seems to be the common theme lately among anyone writing about Google Glass. While I'm an advocate for personal privacy, I also understand that it only applies to private spaces. I don't want the government, or anyone for that matter, ""peeking"" through my bedroom window (or any other window of my house). There are certain establishments that I frequent that I really don't want everyone knowing that I go to, but they're all on private property, and the owners of such spaces are pretty good about restricting the use of recording devices by their patrons (although they may use CCTV for their own security purposes).</span><br/><br/><span>I'm also savvy enough to recognize that there are spaces where it would be inappropriate for me to use a recording device, such as a public restroom or a movie theater (or even a live theatre). I'm also not going to take pictures or video of a stranger without their permission, and I'm especially not going to record pictures/video of kids in a playground to post on pedophile sites; I hate pedophiles as much as any normal person. If I do happen to take pictures that involve other people, it'll probably be part of a crowd scene in a public space, and I won't be specifically targeting an individual.</span><br/><br/><span>I'll be using my Glass to document the minutiae of my own life, which will involve the people that I know (except for the few who have already requested that I don't record them). The only person really giving up their privacy is me, and I'll be choosing which aspects of my life I wish to share with others. I know full well that whenever I'm in a public space, my life is already being recorded from a variety of viewpoints, and for various reasons. I'm not ashamed of anything I might do in public (although I might be embarrassed at times). If people witness me going about my life, it's because I have made the choice to be part of society. If they happen to record me doing so, that's okay, as long as they don't misrepresent me (or unfairly profit from my performance).</span><br/><br/><span>I look around and see how the plethora of cameras has actually benefited society. When bombs went off in Boston, official examination of the collected recordings made by those in attendance quickly identified the suspects (after a few false starts) and eventually led to circumstances that prevented them from doing any more harm.</span><br/><br/><span>We live in a much different world than we did a decade ago, but that's the way it has always been. Society is changing at an accelerated rate, and with the cyber-genie released from the vacuum tube, fantastical technology will constantly be developed that will allows us to reshape our reality in ways only imagined in the best science fiction offerings. I, for one, welcome the opportunity to finally live in the future that I once only dreamed about.</span><br/><br/><span>The technophobes will always fear change, but that's because they don't fully understand the actual capabilities of the newest gadgets. However, I don't want to be held back by their misconceptions. I am an explorer, one of the chosen, who is willing to navigate the waters where there be dragons. I will lead by example, and I'm joined by others who understand that many feel we're sailing over the edge of the world. But we'll prove that there are new lands waiting for us, and we're more than willing to share with others what we discover, while at the same time, respecting the privacy of those who wish to remain anonymous.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><br/><i>To Murder Galatea </i>is about a young museum warehouse keeper’s journey during a time of crisis and social anxiety. He has to fight off a mob of iconoclasts and save artworks from the museum's evil curator.<br/><br/>My name is Moyu Chen, and I am the author of <i>To Murder Galatea</i>. I wrote this book because I want to explore the thrilling theme of iconoclasm in a secular context. It is always fascinating to think that people actually destroy artworks, which are usually lionized and preserved, on some occasions. I also wrote this story to explore social anxiety due to the rise of social injustice and the consequent protests. I want to help readers and myself make sense of current events and affairs in the real world. As a result, I imagined a world in which social injustice is ‘exterminated.’ People celebrate the unity of humanity and at the same time they are haunted by their dark past. The world in the book is fictional, but it also alludes to our reality in which people are and were desperate to find a path to justice and to fight, protest, and survive. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that we cannot forget history by simply getting rid of the reminder of it. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to confront our own shared history with the book creating a twilight zone that is ostensibly fictional but cautionary in nature. I hope you will realize that when diversity and disparity are forbidden, and when inclusivity is driven by law, a world with unity can be much less of a Utopia than one without it.<br/>You will love this book if you are an art enthusiast and ardently care about social change. <br/><br/><i>To Murder Galatea</i> speaks to art lovers and “all good people” who want to grapple with art and artworks and social change in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>To Murder Galatea</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing us into engaging questions like:<br/> </p>
<ul>
<li>Is it possible that an artwork, though representing an artist’s voice, can hold some degree of neutrality before the beholder? </li>
<li>Should seemingly offensive artworks be preserved or destroyed?</li>
<li>To what degree do those objects, artworks and monuments have power over us and our way of thinking?</li>
</ul>
<p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing art, art history, and social changes will shape us all for the better.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April, 2021.</li>
<li>The Cover Design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)</li>
<li>The Layout Design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).</li>
<li>The Copyediting of my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</li>
<li>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book when I ultimately publish in Spring, 2021.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I pre-sell 130 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 155 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 205 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover and an audiobook.<br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish and a handwritten thank-you note.</li>
<li>Your name will appear in the Acknowledgments section of my book (“with Special Thanks to”).</li>
<li>You will receive early access to the Introduction and some excerpts from my book, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback.</li>
<li>You will have the opportunity to be involved in selecting my cover and title.</li>
<li>You will be invited to join my Author Community and get behind-the-scenes sneak peeks into the publishing process.</li>
<li>And much more!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Moyu Chen is a part-time author and a senior Art History major student at Franklin &amp; Marshall College.<br/><br/>During other times when he does not sit in front of his laptop, pulling his hair out while writing, Moyu is a mediocre piano player, a barely abstemious chocoholic, a cream-sherry lover, and most important, an introvert proud of his taciturnity. <br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Moyu Chen at moyu.chen@icloud.com and c._moyu on Instagram.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:<br/><br/>Please share my pre-sale campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family, and network. Please use #ToMurderGalatea* and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press, so we can help amplify your efforts. You can easily share my Pre-Sale Campaign Page via Indiegogo at the top of the page. <br/><br/>Please share my book with 5 friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it via text or direct message on social media.<br/><br/>Thank you so much for all of your love and support!<br/><br/>Thanks again,</p>

As a result, I imagined a world in which social injustice is ‘exterminated.’ People celebrate the unity of humanity and at the same time they are haunted by their dark past. The world in the book is fictional, but it also alludes to our reality in which people are and were desperate to find a path to justice and to fight, protest, and survive. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that we cannot forget history by simply getting rid of the reminder of it. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to confront our own shared history with the book creating a twilight zone that is ostensibly fictional but cautionary in nature. I hope you will realize that when diversity and disparity are forbidden, and when inclusivity is driven by law, a world with unity can be much less of a Utopia than one without it.You will love this book if you are an art enthusiast and ardently care about social change. To Murder Galatea speaks to art lovers and “all good people” who want to grapple with art and artworks and social change in a new way.Ultimately, I hope that To Murder Galatea inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing us into engaging questions like: 

Is it possible that an artwork, though representing an artist’s voice, can hold some degree of neutrality before the beholder? 
Should seemingly offensive artworks be preserved or destroyed?
To what degree do those objects, artworks and monuments have power over us and our way of thinking?

I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing art, art history, and social changes will shape us all for the better.

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Chidera Ubah, and I am the author of Chasing Passion. I wrote this book because I felt like there are certain perspectives missing from the advice and stories people give when you ask them what to do about “finding your passion”, and I wanted this book to address a couple of those perspectives. My book details the journey of a Nigerian English teacher by the name of Adanna Ikeji, who is fulfilling her desire to find something she is passionate about that will inspire her to do something ambitious and leave an interesting legacy.My hope is that, in reading this book, you’ll realize that that the idea of passion, or living a passion-filled lifestyle doesn’t look the same for everybody, and it shouldn’t have to. Just because your passion doesn’t mirror someone else’s, or your experiences don’t match, doesn’t mean that you lack passion. It just means that it manifests in your life differently.  As long as it makes sense to you, then that’s all that counts!<br/><br/>In this book, you’ll get to explore different themes that concern:</p>
<ul>
<li>Passion &amp; Fame/Accolades: People believe that if you’re truly passionate about something, your enthusiasm for it should be able to translate to views, clicks, likes, retweets, etc. This causes some people think that if they can’t get attention or recognition for what they do, their passion is invalid.</li>
<li>Passion &amp; Legacy: Most of us would like to be remembered for something special or noteworthy; we don’t just want to be another passing face among everyone else. But should we be more concerned about creating a legacy for the world, or being a kind and memorable person to those who know us intimately?</li>
<li>The Nature of Passion: When people hear passion, they’re likely to first think of a single career or hobby. However, people can be passionate about a quality or trait (like being kind, reliable, trustworthy, understanding, etc.), people can be passionate about a role they play (being a good sister, being a good friend, being a good mother, etc.), or people can be passionate about multiple things, choose their career based off one thing, and do the rest on the side, or blend them in with their career (i.e. a doctor who is passionate about writing can be a medical journalist).</li>
</ul>

<p>I have studied Biological Sciences and a Minor in Public Health at Wayne State University, and have participated in a series of unique extracurriculars that reflect my interest and passion for experiencing all the opportunities that life has to offer. I wrote this book somewhat as a self-reflection of my journey in trying to define passion in a way that made sense for me, and not trying to box myself into the vision of passion that society has framed for itself. I want people to know that their passion doesn’t have to look or function a specific way in order for it to be valid, a realization that took me some time to make.<br/> </p>

<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you.

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Chidera Ubah, and I am the author of Chasing Passion. I wrote this book because I felt like there are certain perspectives missing from the advice and stories people give when you ask them what to do about “finding your passion”, and I wanted this book to address a couple of those perspectives. My book details the journey of a Nigerian English teacher by the name of Adanna Ikeji, who is fulfilling her desire to find something she is passionate about that will inspire her to do something ambitious and leave an interesting legacy.My hope is that, in reading this book, you’ll realize that that the idea of passion, or living a passion-filled lifestyle doesn’t look the same for everybody, and it shouldn’t have to. Just because your passion doesn’t mirror someone else’s, or your experiences don’t match, doesn’t mean that you lack passion. It just means that it manifests in your life differently.  As long as it makes sense to you, then that’s all that counts!In this book, you’ll get to explore different themes that concern:

Passion & Fame/Accolades: People believe that if you’re truly passionate about something, your enthusiasm for it should be able to translate to views, clicks, likes, retweets, etc. This causes some people think that if they can’t get attention or recognition for what they do, their passion is invalid.
Passion & Legacy: Most of us would like to be remembered for something special or noteworthy; we don’t just want to be another passing face among everyone else. But should we be more concerned about creating a legacy for the world, or being a kind and memorable person to those who know us intimately?
The Nature of Passion: When people hear passion, they’re likely to first think of a single career or hobby. However, people can be passionate about a quality or trait (like being kind, reliable, trustworthy, understanding, etc.), people can be passionate about a role they play (being a good sister, being a good friend, being a good mother, etc.), or people can be passionate about multiple things, choose their career based off one thing, and do the rest on the side, or blend them in with their career (i.e. a doctor who is passionate about writing can be a medical journalist).


What We Need & What You Get
This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:

I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:

<div>The book will definitely make you think a lot, that's for sure! Sometimes it will make you smile and agree. Sometimes it will make you go all pissed off about something you are not sure about what it is. Boring is the only thing I'm certain that this book will never be! The core idea is to push you out of your comfort zone, and from there, support you find a way to design your own path.

<p>I just want to have the freedom to fully dedicate my next two months to finish the book without having to worry financially and then defocusing by engaging in other revenue generating activities. I also want my travels within the next two months to be fully dedicated to gather more stories to make the book better without having to worry about anything else.</p>
<p>I've been working on this book for quite a while and have the complete draft ready. Now I want to dedicate myself to compile the exercises within the different chapters and add the stories that give personality to each one of them. The idea is to have the book ready for self-publishing by the end of September; so, if you support me with any of the perks that includes a signed book, you'll receive your copies by the end of October 2012!</p>
<p>Your support to this campaign will give me the freedom I need to enter into my <em>""popcorn creation mood""</em> and get the book finished. And I have to say that this is all I dream about for the past month or so!</p>

<div>
<p>If you can't contribute money, I understand <em>(believe me!)</em> Or if you prefer to wait for the release of the book to buy it, I understand that as well!</p>
<p>The book will be available to be purchased online only, and <strong>the shipping costs plus my hand written personalized dedication truly make it a better deal to pre-buy it here</strong> - <em>I had to say it!</em></p>
<p>Please notice that no matter what you contribution is, your name <strong>will be listed</strong> in a special acknowledgments page of the book! Also notice that all perks that involve copies of the book <strong>include</strong> shipping from Portugal to <strong>anywhere in the world</strong> using express not trackable shipment. I'll start shipping the books in October, so depending on where you are you will be receiving yours latest by the end of November 2012.  </p>
<p>So, <strong>why should YOU support this campaign?</strong> Simple: Because - <em>as I mention it earlier -</em>  it will be cheaper for you; because your book will arrive with a personal dedication handwritten from me; and because in that way you will make sure that I can completely focus the next two months to finish something totally awesome for YOU!</p>

<h3>""This is either genius masquerading as psychosis or the other way around- And as to which, Ganje has blissfully left it to the reader to decide.""- Eldon Thompson, Author of ""The Legend of Asahiel"" and ""Warder"" trilogies. </h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>(An unnecessarily wordy summary)</h3>
<p>Well hello there. If by some magical stroke of luck you've arrived here, you're probably wondering a very simple and biblical question: ""Who the hell are you?"" Well. That one's easy enough, even though I must admit I don't like your tone. I'm Luke Ganje and I like to tell stories. Very specific stories, in this case. Horrible stories. The kinds of stories you probably wouldn't want to read aloud in the presence of priests, rabbits (not a typo, they're finicky), or your dear Aunt Ida who is prone to bouts of prayer and dementia. </p>
<p>This is a collection of 11 episodes of the absurd. From answering the question we always wanted to know ""If Air Bud were real, all the balls to the face would have catastrophic health consequences... right?"" to a fine dissection of why it's a terrible idea to take your sociopathic son on a hunting trip, this anthology (we actually prefer ""almost-novel"", it makes us sound sexier) has it all. There's profanity (a lot. We counted), violence (trust us on that one, but the severed limbs are tastefully done), absurdity (I mean...naturally), and a cast of miscreants so repellent that they will routinely cause you to wonder ""How in the Hell could this possibly be a good idea?""</p>
<p>The truth is, we don't know. We have absolutely no clue.</p>
<p>But it seemed like a good idea at the time.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>JOIN THE PREORDER! </h3>
<p>In this, my first foray into self-publication, we're seeking funding to get this book released unto the masses (not unlike a hoard of locusts) through pre-orders to streamline the whole process with a can-do spirit. What this will be is a revolutionary (narrator: he clearly doesn't know what that word means) way of publishing wherein I'll either ship you signed copies or you can collect them at a release party that is sure to be the event of the century. </p>
<p>Get the book signed! Get some swag! Get one of the rare Advanced Readers Copies! Pay a little more and find a version of yourself in the next absurd story! (About that last one: Tread carefully. It's a one-track road to seeing yourself put through a literal gauntlet of the ridiculously macabre). </p>
<p>In short, support this venture. Support a stark raving lunatic and his cast of unforgettable monsters. And maybe, just maybe, you'll laugh. </p>
<p>Either that or you'll burn the thing in a demonstration sometime in August, but at that point I'll already have your money. </p>
<p>I win. </p>

We counted), violence (trust us on that one, but the severed limbs are tastefully done), absurdity (I mean...naturally), and a cast of miscreants so repellent that they will routinely cause you to wonder ""How in the Hell could this possibly be a good idea?""
The truth is, we don't know. We have absolutely no clue.
But it seemed like a good idea at the time.
 

JOIN THE PREORDER! 
In this, my first foray into self-publication, we're seeking funding to get this book released unto the masses (not unlike a hoard of locusts) through pre-orders to streamline the whole process with a can-do spirit. What this will be is a revolutionary (narrator: he clearly doesn't know what that word means) way of publishing wherein I'll either ship you signed copies or you can collect them at a release party that is sure to be the event of the century. 
Get the book signed! Get some swag! Get one of the rare Advanced Readers Copies! Pay a little more and find a version of yourself in the next absurd story! (About that last one: Tread carefully. It's a one-track road to seeing yourself put through a literal gauntlet of the ridiculously macabre). 
In short, support this venture. Support a stark raving lunatic and his cast of unforgettable monsters. And maybe, just maybe, you'll laugh. 
Either that or you'll burn the thing in a demonstration sometime in August, but at that point I'll already have your money.

Keduanya melambangkan keseimbangan antara tua-muda, pemikir-pekerja, pebisnis-birokrat, Indonesia Timur-Barat. Terlebih lagi, saya percaya mereka jujur, terpercaya, memiliki track record bersih, pluralis, dan cinta Indonesia.Sonni. Sonni adalah alumni Universitas Bina Nusantara Jakarta, mengambil jurusan manajemen dan ekonomi. Saat ini ia adalah seorang wiraswasta. Mengapa saya memilih Jokowi-JK? Pertama, karena mereka sudah teruji prestasinya di mata ibukota maupun di mata dunia. Kedua, karena Indonesia butuh figur orang yang jujur serta merakyat. Ketiga, karena Indonesia butuh perbaikan sistem di segala aspek yang tidak berpihak pada kepentingan sekelompok orang berkuasa.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Story of My Book</span></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Brian Ely, and I am the author of <i>The Passionate Professional: Finding Fulfillment through a Work-Life Balance</i>. This book is about building balance between a passion and a career. Leveraging this balance in meaningful ways can merge these spheres into a union that is more fulfilling than the sum of its parts: work-life balance. <br/><br/>I wrote this book because of an overwhelming sense of imbalance I encountered during my first two years at college. Academics and professional development had pushed almost everything else I had loved and pursued out of my life. <br/><br/>This didn’t sit right. <br/><br/>So I set out to to bring back not only my passions, but pieces of my own identity. In short, I strove to regain balance. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how to pursue a similar balance between your own passions and career. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for building a work-life symmetry. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you find greater fulfillment and satisfaction from both the creative and material sides of your life. <br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about building work-life balance as well as its practical and meaningful applications. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<p>How Eman Rahman, a Georgetown alum, was able to land a career on Wall Street while majoring in English. </p>
<p>How Eric Anslyn, a chemistry professor at the University of Texas Austin, maintains his childhood hobby of building and racing go-karts while simultaneously pursuing a decorated career in supramolecular chemistry. </p>
<p>How David Solomon, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, spins records and produces his own electronic music in his spare time. </p>
<p>You will love this book if you feel that one or more area of your life are unbalanced; if you seek new ways to find fulfillment from your endeavors; or if you strive to explore new dimensions of success. <br/><br/><i>The Passionate Professional</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to landed professionals and college students who want to look at work-life balance and personal fulfillment in a new way.</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>The Book - <i>The Passionate Professional</i>
</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The book is written in three parts...</p>
<p><br/>Part One contains the Introduction and Chapters One and Two. In this section, I introduce the concept of work-life balance. I discuss how in many instances, success is regarded as a one-dimensional concept when now, more than ever, individuals should be cognizant of not just their careers, but their passions and their hobbies. With these ideas serving as a foundation for the rest of the book, I then showcase a handful of stories from landed professionals such as Warren Buffett, who have found ways to pursue effective work-life balances in their own lives. <br/><br/>Part Two contains Chapters Three-Five. I delve deeper into the work-life balance, exploring how to engage passion and productivity simultaneously, whether it’s in a career or in college academics. Additionally, I address the question of specialization, and how to refine the work-life balance without leaving it devoid of passion and creativity.  <br/><br/>Part Three contains Chapters Six-Eight, as well as my Closing Thoughts. These chapters take the idea of work-life balance and apply it to larger concepts such as student start-ups and company culture. Additionally, I discuss how the college admissions process can lay an ideal foundation for a successful work-life balance. That said, it remains a powerful philosophy that can accompany an individual throughout his or her life. </p>

I believe that dreams can come true and anything is possible if we keep working towards our goals. This is my dream and I am asking for help to bring it to life. This story is close to my heart and I feel it can be a great tool to bring joy to many kids and make a positive impact in various ways.I am raising money with this page so that I can publish my book, share it with kids in all types of environments such as libraries, schools, parks, skate shops, book stores and anywhere else where kids can be reached. I want to make a difference in other people's lives using my gifts. Any contribution will go towards making this happen, you can be a part of this exciting project.I need to raise $3,800 for printing costs, I am offering rewards in exchange for donations and a small fraction of this money goes to shipping and there is also a processing fee for indie go go and paypal. Some of the perks for your help include signed book marks, 1st edition signed copies of the book, t-shirts, artwork, handmade wooden toys, skateboard racks, book ends and personal appearances and readings.If you can't donate, any support will be helpful such as telling friends and family or sharing on all types of social media. Thank you for checking out my project, it means a lot to me.",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

The 6 Pillars of Success (however you define success, btw) will <b>have

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Every Believer must fully understand how vitally important the understanding of faith is to our success in the Kingdom of God.  Faith is the “currency” of the Kingdom, but it is also the “current” of the Kingdom.  Faith makes everything work, it makes everything move,  it makes everything happen.  The lack of faith displeases God, but the proper application will allow us to literally bring countries to their knees. The revelation that miracles were never designed by God to be used <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">for</span></em> the believer, but <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">by</span></em> the believer has never been more of a critical teaching than in today’s time.  There is a move occurring in the Kingdom of God, an outpouring of His Holy Spirit which is perhaps the greatest move the world will know before the second coming.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this book, Jassen R. Grant reveals from the scriptures key elements of faith that will literally change the course and destiny of every believer that accepts the truth of God’s word.  These laws when applied on a consistent basis will allow God to work His perfect work in our lives moving us into our destiny and bringing Him the glory due His name.  Learn “12 Critical Laws of Faith” that will change your life, starting today!!!</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Many thanks to the more than 115 persons who have put me over my initial goal of $10,000.  These funds as described below will help me cover the expenses of researching and writing Hunger, Incorporated. I intend to use any additional funds raised to pay myself a stipend. The more I am able to raise the more I can focus on writing. With only a few days left, I’m hoping we can make it to $15,000! </p>
<h2><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Who am I?</span></strong></h2>
<p>My name is Andy Fisher. I played a lead role in catalyzing and shepherding the good food movement since the mid 1990s, as co-founder and leader of the Community Food Security Coalition. I have worked tirelessly during this time to build connections between the public health, anti-hunger and local food movements.</p>
<h2><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What is the issue?</span></strong></h2>
<p>Big business stands in the way of eliminating hunger, of reducing income inequality, of reducing obesity, and of creating a sustainable and economically democratic agriculture. For example, up to 80% of employees in some Wal-Mart stores receive food stamps. Fast food and soda companies deliberately target communities of color for their obesity-creating products, despite the fact that African American, Latino and Native American populations often have higher rates of diseases caused by poor diets, such as diabetes. Big agri-businesses lobby hard to keep in place farm policy that benefits their bottom lines, but harms the environment or puts family farmers out of business.</p>
<h2><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What am I writing?</span></strong></h2>
<p>I am writing a book about how big corporations benefit from the way we deal with hunger in the US. Not only do they receive tens of billions of dollars from federal food programs, such as food stamps and WIC, but much of the anti-hunger community sees big business as a partner in ending hunger. This evolution of the anti-hunger movement from being at the epicenter of social justice concerns to more of a middle of the road corporate-friendly position has had positive short-term effects, but negative long-term impacts on eliminating hunger. These partnerships have also unintentionally made it more difficult to address obesity and reforming the nation’s detrimental farm policies.</p>
<p>Tentatively entitled Hunger Inc., the book will be published in 2014, most likely by MIT Press.</p>
<p>I have one chapter completed, and will be writing about a chapter per month from now until late summer or early fall 2013.</p>
<h2><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Funding and Budget</span></strong></h2>
<p>I have been funding this project out of my family’s pocket to-date. As I am currently unemployed, our pockets are none too deep these days. I’ll get very modest royalties once the book starts selling, but I won’t see that money until 2015. I anticipate that my research costs through next summer are about $10,000:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cell Phone (pre-pay  $25/month x 10 months)                   $250</p>
<p>Supplies, such as toner cartridges, paper                           $250</p>
<p>Purchase of publications, subscriptions                              $250</p>
<p>Travel for interviews                                                    $7,000</p>
<p>(Northern California twice , Southern California, New York City  twice, Washington DC twice, Pittsburgh, Youngstown, OH, New England, Phoenix, and Chicago)</p>
<p>Research Assistant, 150 hours x $15/hour                          $2250</p>
<p>Any funds over and above the $10,000 I raise will go toward paying myself a small stipend. If I don’t reach the $10,000 goal, I will need to forego having a research assistant or try to raise the funds elsewhere.</p>
<h2><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Impact</span></strong></h2>
<p>My hopes and dreams – and my plans – are that this book and a subsequent organizing campaign will ignite a dialogue about the future of how we fight hunger in the US.</p>

<p><u>Story of My Book</u></p>
<p><i>Creating New Medicines: strategies for building the next biotech start-up</i> is about a new model for helping future biotech innovators think strategically and successfully turn scientific concepts into patient-impacting new medicines. </p>
<p>I wrote this book because I was deeply impacted by seeing the number of patients that ran out of medical options. People deserve and need more medicines and medical options, but this requires more people willing to take the risk of starting or building companies that will pursue this. In my experience, young scientists are often interested in applying their skills to help real people, but aren't sure how to start. This book is meant to show you how.<br/><br/>Experience is crucial in science. This is undeniable. But it's also not everything, and there are ways for young scientists to add value to new companies when they can combine having a teachable attitude with openness to straying off the traditional academic career path.</p>
<p>In the book, I will also cover case studies of famous scientific innovations with original interviews:</p>
<ul>
<li>The stories of blockbuster drugs Tysabri and Remicade, from experienced entrepreneur and angel investor Dr. Martin Sanders</li>
<li>Creating medicines with a patient-centered view, with John Crowley's personal story (fun fact, his life story was turned into a Harrison Ford movie, called <i>Extraordinary Measures</i>)</li>
<li>The Gleevec Story - themes for translating basic science and an interview with the clinician who ran the pivotal clinical trials, Dr. Brian Druker </li>
<li>Insights on the biotech industry and investing from Keith Crandell, Managing Director and Co-founder of ARCH Venture Partners</li>
<li>How to bootstrap a biotech start-up creatively with an interview with Jake Glanville, who was featured in Gimlet Media's <i>Start-Up </i>podcast </li>
</ul> <p><u>What You'll Get</u></p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<ul>

I also talk about how the United States can learn from the education systems and cultures in other countries in order to get more women to work in STEM.<br/><br/>My name is Leanna Chester and I am the author of Importing STEM. I wrote this book because I was shocked at some of the things women who work in STEM fields face and was curious if women in other countries around the world faced similar situations.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover what it is like to be a woman in STEM in today's world. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for equality in tech. And ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you create safe spaces for women and encourage the girls in your life to pursue whatever they want, even if everyone else tells them otherwise.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about cultural differences and technology including:</p><ul>
<li>how we instill societal expectations on children based on their gender</li>
<li>the issues that women in tech face</li>
<li>how we can change our views to allow women to feel safe and thrive in STEM</li>
</ul><p>You will love this book if you are curious about how cultural differences affect us, want to learn more about various education systems, or wonder why STEM fields are male-dominated (at least in the United States).<br/><br/>Importing STEM is a non-fiction book that speaks to young girls who are interested in math and technology and people who are looking at gender differences in certain fields and why we need equality in these fields.</p><h3>The Book - Importing STEM</h3><p>The book is written in 3 Parts....<br/><br/>In Part 1, I talk about the history of women in STEM in the United States and other western countries. I also talk about the stereotypes that exist about women in STEM and why having more women in these fields is important.<br/><br/>In Part 2, readers will learn about the impact of cultural and societal expectations. I also challenge the beliefs and stereotypes mentioned in Part 1 and talk about the importance of role models and mentorship.<br/><br/>In Part 3, I talk about how the United States can get more women and girls to pursue careers in STEM based on what other countries are doing. I pull examples from other countries that have a very high rate of women working or studying in technology and other STEM fields and show that the US can learn quite a bit from the education systems of other countries.</p><h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p><ul>
<li>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in July 2020.</li>
<li>The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!</li>
<li>The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)</li>
<li>The Copyediting for My Book - to help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</li>
<li>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this summer</li>
</ul><p>When I pre-sell 100 copies of my book, I will publish. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish an audiobook. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition.<br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:</p><ul>
<li>You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish.</li>
<li>A Personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering my book</li>

<li>The opportunity to help give me feedback and be involved in selecting my cover</li>
<li>I will do a book topic/workshop seminar where I will share experience the experiences of writing my book</li>
</ul><p>And more...</p><h3>About the Author</h3><p>Leanna Chester is a computer science student at Boston University. She wrote this book because she noticed that there were such a small amount of women in her classes and in her meetings at work. Leanna began to wonder why this was, and especially if this was the case in other countries around the world. She hopes to show that women can succeed in STEM and that the female perspective in these fields is not only important but necessary.<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Leanna at leanna.r.chester@gmail.com and instagram, twitter and linkedIn.</p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.</p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:<br/>Please Share my Pre-sale Campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network.

<p>Brad Beatty, the father of Lillian Bay, has teamed up with author Ron Knight and Melissa Link of Brand Eleven Eleven to raise awareness for children born with Cystic Hygroma, along with inspiring families that need to make impossible choices when it comes to the medical needs of their child.<br/> <br/>We are currently developing an adult version (Saving Lillian Bay) and childrens version (Miracles Happen) of Lillian Bay’s amazing story. It is our goal to get these books into hospitals and to families that need inspiration, hope, and faith.</p>
<h2><strong>What is Saving Lillian Bay About?</strong></h2>
<p>Millions of dollars, endless prayers, and several miracles were needed to save Lillian Bay’s life. She did not understand medical reports, or the odds of living. She has not been on this earth long enough to grasp the idea of fighting with all her strength. She does not comprehend strength, love, or faith, and yet, displays those gifts with each breath.<br/> <br/>Lillian Bay defied all odds and is now a blessing to others.<br/> <br/>Lillian's community, Boca Grande, believed in giving more than receiving, pulling together all their resources to send Lillian to the most skilled doctors in the world.</p>
<h2>The Impact:</h2>
<p>While this story is about a little girl and an amazing community, this story can inspire renewed hope for those that are struggling. We would love to be able to donate books to the children's hospitals for their patients and parents. Our goal is truly to let anyone that is losing hope know that MIRACLES HAPPEN.</p>
<h2>What we need?</h2>
<p>We are raising money to kick off this MIRACLES HAPPEN Campaign. Our goal is to purchase books and share Lillian’s story with others. The majority of funds raised will go to our intial inventory purchase, website development, marketing/PR, and fees to have the book become available through as many outlets as possible. The more money we raise the more books we can purchase and the more marketing we can do to let people know about Cystic Hygroma. </p>
<p>Once we have published the books, profits will go towards raising awareness for Cystic Hygroma, funding for those that need a miracle, organizations that support those that need a miracle and a portion will go towards Lillian Bay's ongoing medical expenses.</p>
<h2>What do you get?</h2>
<p>Of course you receive all the perks associated with your level.  But the true value is that you get to be a part of an amazing journey to inspire the world to believe in miracles again. I think we could all use a little bit of faith and hope that MIRACLES can and do HAPPEN all around us.</p>
<h2>When will the books come out?</h2>
<p>Both books have already been written and are currenlty being edited. We have a great team that has been willing to work hard at no pay to make this project move forward. During the indiegogo campaign we will be sharing book covers and launching the first phase of the SavingLillianBay.com website. We are aiming for ebook completion in August and paperback copies of the books due out in September.</p>

lovers worldwide.</p><p>3.  You are providing readers who can't afford to buy a book with a chance to own a copy of KEAGON OF THE REDBLADE, or find it at their local library for check out.</p><p>4.  Every level but one provide you with a FREE BOOK in one form or another!  In other words, you are truly getting back something of value in return for your hard earned bucks.<br/><span

WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THIS CAMPAIGN?  
We are trying to raise money to defray the costs my 86-year-old father incurred to redesign the cover of his book KEAGON OF THE REDBLADE.  These costs include paying the artist and change fees to the publisher.  We are also hoping to raise money to pay for books we can donate to local libraries, or readers who can't afford to buy a book themselves.
86?  THAT'S OLDDDD!  WHAT'S THIS OLD COOT LOOK LIKE?
You can see what Lee looks like as of August, 2013 in his video, but here's a pic from a few years ago as well.

I WORKED HARD FOR MY MONEY.  WHY SHOULD I GIVE YOU SOME OF MY  GREENBACKS?We know you worked hard for your money!  We also understand you have many worthy choices on IndieGogo that are equally deserving of your financial backing.  Here are some reasons to support our campaign:1.  You are backing an author who has devoted years of his life to writing and has completed five books, so he's a proven entity.  Much different than a novice who is hoping to write a book one day (and may never actually follow through).2.  You are supporting a well-written book, that has thus far existed in obscurity, to reach the light of day and get discovered by book lovers worldwide.3.  You are providing readers who can't afford to buy a book with a chance to own a copy of KEAGON OF THE REDBLADE, or find it at their local library for check out.4.  Every level but one provide you with a FREE BOOK in one form or another!  In other words, you are truly getting back something of value in return for your hard earned bucks.YOU'VE REACHED YOUR GOAL.  WHY ARE YOU GREEDY PIGS LOOKING FOR MORE!?  Yep, it's true!  With the help of our friends, family, and some AWESOME IndieGogo members like YOU, we have reached our minimum goal.  Wooo hooooo!!!  But the key word there is minimum.  We set that number as the lowest amount we wanted to raise, knowing there were higher fees due if we did not meet our goal.  We have always hoped to surpass that number as $500 will not actually cover all of the expenses involved.After the expenses of IndieGogo fees, shipping costs,  and buying the books, we will probably be left with about half of the money raised.  The remainder will cover half of my dad's expenses.  Plus, we would like to give away some additional books, so any additional money will also allow us to share KEAGON with more readers.HOW BAD WAS THE OLD COVER?  DID YOU REALLY NEED TO CHANGE IT?It was bad.  But don't take my word.  Take a look yourself.GOOD LORD!  THAT'S AWFUL!  BUT CAN THE NEW DESIGN BE THAT MUCH BETTER?Uh, yeah.  A heck of a lot better.  OKAY, SO GREAT JOB ON THE NEW COVER DESIGN, BUT FACT IS, I DON'T HAVE MUCH MONEY TO GIVE.We have changed our perks recently and now even with a contribution for as little as $10, you can get an eBook version of KEAGON!NO, I MEAN I HAVE NO MONEY TO GIVE.  NOT A SINGLE DIME...BUT I WOULD REALLY REALLY LOVE TO READ KEAGON OF THE REDBLADE.  HELP A BROTHER OUT?Ohhh!  Got it.  Sure!  Like we said, our goal is to get KEAGON read by fantasy book lovers around the world.  If you just can't afford to contribute, message us and we will make sure to get you an eBook or PDF version of the book.  We have already given away five copies of the paperback thanks to generous donors and might have additional copies to giveaway depending on how much we end up with at the end of our campaign.Bottom line, if you want to read KEAGON, we will do our best to make that happen!TELL ME MORE ABOUT THE BOOK.Here's an excerpt from KEAGON OF THE RED BLADE:""Keagon regarded the fat stranger, who sat across the game rug like a pile of camel dung.  He called himself Akim and claimed to be a merchant, although Keagon suspected he had lied on both accounts.

<h3>Story of My Book / <i>Historia de mi libro</i>
</h3>
<i>Creativity and Play at Work</i> is a book about how to leverage the small cracks in the system to innovate right where you are. It provides inspiration, strategies and tools to begin your very own <strong>#playfulrevolution</strong>.<br/><br/>My name is Begoña Pino and I am the author of <i>Creativity and Play at Work</i>. I decided to write this book because I feel the world really needs more creativity right now in order to solve big problems in a volatile and uncertain context. Also, I think most people need to activate their creativity to deal with change, new situations and new emotions.<br/><br/>This book explores the intersections of <strong>creativity, play and the workplace</strong>, making the most of the opportunities that you have. It describes <strong>processes and tools</strong> to bring the best of people’s imagination out in the world, and it makes a strong case for <strong>inclusion and diversity</strong> as a core component of innovation. The main point is about finding the small cracks in the system where you can plant the seed of innovation, and then be patient enough to keep finding more cracks and planting some more. Over time, even a small seed can grow in concrete.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the value that play and humour can bring to the work space, and how neurodiversity can be a real asset in any innovation team. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for creativity in all its forms (theory, my own practice, facilitation in others). Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you grow in creative confidence first and activate it in teams and groups (including friends and family).<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about creative mindset, confidence and environments as well as the importance of patience, discipline, play, humour and risk taking. You'll hear stories such as:<ul>
<li>One man who organised a 1 hour game session and saved the company $6.5 million</li>
<li>A team leader who took his team on a secret self-funded teambuilding weekend</li>
<li>A marketer who created a viral campaign with 10M views out of a joke</li>
</ul> You will love this book if you have an itch for innovating, want to bring more playfulness to your life or need to get a team up to speed in a challenging project.<br/><br/><i>Creativity and Play at Work</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to team leaders in technology and any changemaker (human resources, executives) who want to look at creativity and play in a new way that elevates innovation, productivity, engagement and team happiness.<br/><br/><br/><strong>ESPAÑOL</strong><br/><br/><i>Creatividad y Juego en el Trabajo</i> es un libro sobre cómo aprovechar las pequeñas grietas del sistema para innovar justo donde estás. Proporciona inspiración, estrategias y herramientas para comenzar tu propia #revoluciónlúdica.<br/><br/>Me llamo Begoña Pino y soy la autora de <i>Creatividad y Juego en el Trabajo</i>. Decidí escribir este libro porque creo que el mundo realmente necesita más creatividad en estos momentos para resolver los grandes problemas en un contexto volátil e incierto. Además, creo que la mayoría de la gente necesita activar su creatividad para afrontar los cambios, las nuevas situaciones y las nuevas emociones.<br/><br/>Este libro explora las intersecciones de la <strong>creatividad, el juego y el lugar de trabajo</strong>, aprovechando al máximo las oportunidades que se tienen. Describe <strong>procesos y herramientas</strong> para sacar lo mejor de la imaginación de las personas en el mundo, y defiende firmemente la <strong>inclusión y la diversidad</strong> como componente central de la innovación. El punto principal es encontrar las pequeñas grietas en el sistema donde se puede plantar la semilla de la innovación, y luego ser lo suficientemente paciente para seguir encontrando más grietas y plantar algunas más. Con el tiempo, incluso una pequeña semilla puede crecer en hormigón.<br/><br/>Mi esperanza es que, al leer este libro, descubras el valor que el juego y el humor pueden aportar al espacio de trabajo, y cómo la neurodiversidad puede ser un activo real en cualquier equipo de innovación. En este libro, espero inspirarte el mismo tipo de pasión y entusiasmo que tengo por la creatividad en todas sus formas (teoría, mi propia práctica, facilitación grupal). En última instancia, quiero que veas este libro como una herramienta que te ayude a crecer en confianza creativa primero, y a activarla en equipos y grupos (incluyendo amigos y familiares) después.<br/><br/>En este libro, aprenderás sobre la mentalidad, la confianza y los entornos creativos, así como la importancia de la paciencia, la disciplina, el juego, el humor y la asunción de riesgos. Verás historias como las de:<br/> <ul>
<li>Un hombre que organizó una sesión de juego de una hora y ahorró a la empresa 6,5 millones de dólares</li>
<li>Un jefe de equipo que llevó a su equipo a un fin de semana secreto y autofinanciado de formación de equipos.</li>
<li>Un vendedor que creó una campaña viral con 10M de visualizaciones a partir de una broma</li>
</ul> Te encantará este libro si tienes ganas de innovar, si quieres incorporar más juego a tu vida o si necesitas poner al día a un equipo en un proyecto desafiante.<br/><br/>Creatividad y Juego en el Trabajo es un libro de no ficción que se dirige a los líderes de equipos de tecnología y a cualquier agente de cambio (recursos humanos, ejecutivos) que quieran ver la creatividad y el juego de una forma nueva que eleve la innovación, la productividad, el compromiso y la felicidad del equipo.<br/><br/> <h3>The Book - Creativity and Play at Work /</h3>

</div></div>","Story of My Book / Historia de mi libro

Creativity and Play at Work is a book about how to leverage the small cracks in the system to innovate right where you are. It provides inspiration, strategies and tools to begin your very own #playfulrevolution.My name is Begoña Pino and I am the author of Creativity and Play at Work. I decided to write this book because I feel the world really needs more creativity right now in order to solve big problems in a volatile and uncertain context. Also, I think most people need to activate their creativity to deal with change, new situations and new emotions.This book explores the intersections of creativity, play and the workplace, making the most of the opportunities that you have. It describes processes and tools to bring the best of people’s imagination out in the world, and it makes a strong case for inclusion and diversity as a core component of innovation. The main point is about finding the small cracks in the system where you can plant the seed of innovation, and then be patient enough to keep finding more cracks and planting some more. Over time, even a small seed can grow in concrete.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the value that play and humour can bring to the work space, and how neurodiversity can be a real asset in any innovation team. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for creativity in all its forms (theory, my own practice, facilitation in others). Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you grow in creative confidence first and activate it in teams and groups (including friends and family).In this book, you'll learn about creative mindset, confidence and environments as well as the importance of patience, discipline, play, humour and risk taking. You'll hear stories such as:
One man who organised a 1 hour game session and saved the company $6.5 million
A team leader who took his team on a secret self-funded teambuilding weekend
A marketer who created a viral campaign with 10M views out of a joke
 You will love this book if you have an itch for innovating, want to bring more playfulness to your life or need to get a team up to speed in a challenging project.Creativity and Play at Work is a nonfiction book that speaks to team leaders in technology and any changemaker (human resources, executives) who want to look at creativity and play in a new way that elevates innovation, productivity, engagement and team happiness.ESPAÑOLCreatividad y Juego en el Trabajo es un libro sobre cómo aprovechar las pequeñas grietas del sistema para innovar justo donde estás. Proporciona inspiración, estrategias y herramientas para comenzar tu propia #revoluciónlúdica.Me llamo Begoña Pino y soy la autora de Creatividad y Juego en el Trabajo. Decidí escribir este libro porque creo que el mundo realmente necesita más creatividad en estos momentos para resolver los grandes problemas en un contexto volátil e incierto. Además, creo que la mayoría de la gente necesita activar su creatividad para afrontar los cambios, las nuevas situaciones y las nuevas emociones.Este libro explora las intersecciones de la creatividad, el juego y el lugar de trabajo, aprovechando al máximo las oportunidades que se tienen. Describe procesos y herramientas para sacar lo mejor de la imaginación de las personas en el mundo, y defiende firmemente la inclusión y la diversidad como componente central de la innovación. El punto principal es encontrar las pequeñas grietas en el sistema donde se puede plantar la semilla de la innovación, y luego ser lo suficientemente paciente para seguir encontrando más grietas y plantar algunas más. Con el tiempo, incluso una pequeña semilla puede crecer en hormigón.Mi esperanza es que, al leer este libro, descubras el valor que el juego y el humor pueden aportar al espacio de trabajo, y cómo la neurodiversidad puede ser un activo real en cualquier equipo de innovación. En este libro, espero inspirarte el mismo tipo de pasión y entusiasmo que tengo por la creatividad en todas sus formas (teoría, mi propia práctica, facilitación grupal). En última instancia, quiero que veas este libro como una herramienta que te ayude a crecer en confianza creativa primero, y a activarla en equipos y grupos (incluyendo amigos y familiares) después.En este libro, aprenderás sobre la mentalidad, la confianza y los entornos creativos, así como la importancia de la paciencia, la disciplina, el juego, el humor y la asunción de riesgos. Verás historias como las de: 
Un hombre que organizó una sesión de juego de una hora y ahorró a la empresa 6,5 millones de dólares
Un jefe de equipo que llevó a su equipo a un fin de semana secreto y autofinanciado de formación de equipos.
Un vendedor que creó una campaña viral con 10M de visualizaciones a partir de una broma
 Te encantará este libro si tienes ganas de innovar, si quieres incorporar más juego a tu vida o si necesitas poner al día a un equipo en un proyecto desafiante.Creatividad y Juego en el Trabajo es un libro de no ficción que se dirige a los líderes de equipos de tecnología y a cualquier agente de cambio (recursos humanos, ejecutivos) que quieran ver la creatividad y el juego de una forma nueva que eleve la innovación, la productividad, el compromiso y la felicidad del equipo. The Book - Creativity and Play at Work /
El libro - Creatividad y juego en el trabajo
The book is written in 4 parts.Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-4. This section introduces the urgency to activate global creativity, and the environment needed to do so, from the role of the team leader, to the culture and the relevance of having a diverse team.Part 2 contains chapters 5-7. In this section general creative processes are introduced as well as the topic of activating team creativity.Part 3 contains chapters 8-13. This part presents all the strategies that are necessary to successfully increase creativity, from patience and discipline, to risk taking, playfulness, humour and being strategic about opportunity finding.Part 4 contains chapters 14-16. In this part you will find sample sessions, activities and templates to help you implement different tactics described earlier. It is your one stop shop, with contributions such as creative tools by Franc Ponti or Jose Ochoa, and a culture manifesto by Mario Armstrong to inspire your own.ESPAÑOLEl libro está escrito en 4 partes.Parte 1 - Contiene la introducción + los capítulos 1-4.

<p>My name is Lisa Liljegren and I am the author of <i>Cast: The True Story of a Mom who Learned to Embrace the Unknown through Urban Fishing</i>. I wrote this book to share the secret world of  urban fishing with you; a world I discovered quite by accident. In my book you'll meet a diverse and generous cast of characters who regularly meet along the banks of urban waters. Some show up to escape home responsibilities, a few angle to feed their families, all the folks I met were open to connection. While waiting for the fish to bite, we swapped stories about survival, love, family, and recipes. They treated me, a first-time fisherman, like one of them.</p>
<p>Everyone loves a good coming of age story and this is mine, only the second time around. As I learned to fish, I also learned to let go of my fears of inevitable family change. We were heading into the season of parental ""lasts"" the summer before our only child's senior year in high school. I didn't know it at the time, but I was searching for my ""nexts"" to soften the blow.<br/><br/>This experience brought me back to the city I love, yanked me out of my comfort zone, and introduced me to new friends and a new passion. In this book, you'll learn a little about fishing and a lot about being in the moment surrounded by the kindness and patience of strangers. I hope my stories make you smile and inspire you to think about your own “river bank.” There is nothing stopping you from going out there and creating your next.<br/> </p>

<h3>Paperback Writer is a Mac/Windows/Linux application that makes it easy for novelists to publish their ebooks as a valid ePub file.</h3>
<p>As an aspiring author who has gone through the ebook publishing cycle, I was surprised by how difficult it is to create a good quality ebook. I ultimately had to dig into the code to create the quality I was seeking.</p>
<p>As I looked into why this was such a challenge, the answer became clear: Word processors like Microsoft Word or Apple's Pages (which are great) were never meant for ebook creation. They come with alot of baggage, such as handling hundreds of fonts, font sizes, tables, lists, columns, images and image placement... the feature list is huge. Any program that handles such a complex list of features must also have a very complex file format and structure to accomodate them. What's more, these programs are meant for the printed page. They deal with margins and page sizes and so forth - concepts that do not translate well to the electronic world.</p>
<p>Novels, by contrast, are simple. They deal with simple data: a table of contents, chapter titles, paragraphs. Sometimes you want to emphasize things with italics, bolds, or (much less likely for novels) underlines. That's about it.</p>
<p>Paperback Writer is a novel writing tool designed from the ground up for ebook publishing. It's a highly focused tool for a very specific purpose. It doesn't allow for any fancy formatting options. You only get what a novelist would typically require to write their story.</p>
<p>The result is a high-quality ebook that will work in your standard e-readers and can be submitted to self-publishing sites like Amazon or Lulu.</p>

</div></div>","Paperback Writer is a Mac/Windows/Linux application that makes it easy for novelists to publish their ebooks as a valid ePub file.
As an aspiring author who has gone through the ebook publishing cycle, I was surprised by how difficult it is to create a good quality ebook. I ultimately had to dig into the code to create the quality I was seeking.
As I looked into why this was such a challenge, the answer became clear: Word processors like Microsoft Word or Apple's Pages (which are great) were never meant for ebook creation. They come with alot of baggage, such as handling hundreds of fonts, font sizes, tables, lists, columns, images and image placement... the feature list is huge. Any program that handles such a complex list of features must also have a very complex file format and structure to accomodate them. What's more, these programs are meant for the printed page. They deal with margins and page sizes and so forth - concepts that do not translate well to the electronic world.
Novels, by contrast, are simple. They deal with simple data: a table of contents, chapter titles, paragraphs. Sometimes you want to emphasize things with italics, bolds, or (much less likely for novels) underlines. That's about it.
Paperback Writer is a novel writing tool designed from the ground up for ebook publishing. It's a highly focused tool for a very specific purpose. It doesn't allow for any fancy formatting options. You only get what a novelist would typically require to write their story.
The result is a high-quality ebook that will work in your standard e-readers and can be submitted to self-publishing sites like Amazon or Lulu.

What tells us an apartment? All about the people. And about himself. I'll write it. In a book. In fanciful and grotesque short stories. On a double page. You want to see the apartment. But the images are hidden: Japanese paperback. You want see the homes, want to meet the people. You want to see the world. Do it. Nobody prevents you. Please take the book with you. And make the world better.
What We Need

3000 € to go on a trip by interrail through europe and for example north-africa. I will visit only airbnb flats and to write and produce the whole book. 
The more money is acquired, the longer is the journey. And the more bizarre and odd stories emerge.
The language: German. 
If the book is a success, publishers are aware and the book will be translated.
But what i really need is Passion. Enthusiasm. Going global. Fancy stories. On cities. Countries. Read. And on people and their homes. And yes, money. I will inform my financiers with a first manuscript about the progress. For just a simple book is a fascinating read, a design and a product guide. And for all of us there is a feeling that there are still people who are so open to disclose their innermost open: the home. Only in this way we will create something that can make the world better: Living in foreign places at local flats with soul, instead of anonymous check-in at the hotel. That is ""Foreign living.

 What Do you get – the pears

Whenever you're in Vienna, at my apartment is available for 1 free night. Every night in my flat is priced at €50 at airbnb. 
The first 10 people can check my apartement for a whole weekend (friday till sunday) – for free.
Free copy.
Free admission to all lectures.

<p>Hi, I'm Rohini
Singh. I hail from the small island of Trinidad in the Caribbean. After ten
years of translating my overactive imagination into words, I've finally put the

<p>I’m
launching this campaign to help my fun-filled, imagination-stretching story and
its message of <b>self-acceptance, self-appreciation, and anti-bullying</b> to get
into the hands of children. If I reach my $2,500 goal, it

</h3>
<p></p>
<p>In our world today, too many children find themselves on the outside looking in. It’s quite heartbreaking to see children who don’t “fit in” being made to feel bad about themselves. They are often bullied, with terrible consequences. When I was a kid, I went through my own struggles with being different, but by developing my own style and learning to be comfortable in my own skin, I was able to turn my differences into a positive.</p>
<p>We all serve different purposes in life, and in so doing, we make the world a better place.  <b>With your donation, we can help children and adults to understand this intuitively... to learn how to deal with the bullying that can come with being different… and, importantly, to have a great time along the way.</b> We Trinidadians are all about having a great time along the way.</p>

<p>First, there was a <b>story</b>. It was about a boy and a girl, and about a curse they shared  in a land called <strong><em>Heskilia</em></strong>. I named this story<i> Spring Charmers.</i><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445855328/cgsxlgijxfh7eds3m9l8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>As I wrote down the story of <i>Spring Charmers</i>, I realized that it was compelling and  fun - 
and
 it <b>worked</b>. <span><span><span><span> I know this because I saw it. First with my own children, and then wi</span><span><span>th other children. </span></span></span></span></span>I saw the 
sparkle in their eyes as they read or listened, I saw them being swept 
away by the story. When <b>children want to play the characters of your story, you know 
it works. </b><br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>But then there were those children who weren't so keen on reading. I knew they would enjoy my story, but perhaps starting a whole book was just too much for them. That was when I began <b>delivering <i>Spring Charmers</i> one chapter a week</b>, ending each chapter with a cliffhanger. And the feedback was amazing: <b>children loved it!</b> They just couldn't wait for the next chapter to be delivered - and that also applied to those who had originally thought that reading was not for them. <br/></p>
<p>But there was a small problem - my story was written in Finnish. <br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447837202/zrybloqhiz8hyybrvzlu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Please don't misunderstand me - Finnish is a beautiful language. It is an old and rich language and it's the language I know the 
best. But I wanted my story to travel the world! So to begin with, I wanted to <b>translate<i> Spring Charmers</i> into English.</b></p>And that's why I'm here. <br/><p></p>
<p>My name is Katja Törmänen and I'm a writer and an illustrator from Finland. I wrote <i>Spring Charmers</i> without targeting my story to any particular age group. Instead I  thought whether I would like to read that story, and the end result is that <b>both children and adults</b> just love my story! I believe<i> Spring Charmers</i> is <b>best suited for children between the ages 8 and 13</b>, but of course every child is unique when it comes to reading. <i>Spring Charmers</i> is also well-suited to be read out loud, <span><span><span><span><span>though it may be a bit too exciting as a bedtime story for the youngest.</span></span></span></span></span>..;)<br/></p>

To be honest - if I would have had the money, I probably would have hired a professional illustrator to cooperate with me. But since I didn't, I was kind of enchanted about the idea of illustrating the book myself. After all, I was the only one who knew what all the characters, places and dragons should look like!<p></p>

<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<br/><br/>
</div></div>","Let the Magic in!
First, there was a story. It was about a boy and a girl, and about a curse they shared  in a land called Heskilia. I named this story Spring Charmers.

As I wrote down the story of Spring Charmers, I realized that it was compelling and  fun - 
and
 it worked.  I know this because I saw it. First with my own children, and then with other children. I saw the 
sparkle in their eyes as they read or listened, I saw them being swept 
away by the story. When children want to play the characters of your story, you know 
it works. 

But then there were those children who weren't so keen on reading. I knew they would enjoy my story, but perhaps starting a whole book was just too much for them. That was when I began delivering Spring Charmers one chapter a week, ending each chapter with a cliffhanger. And the feedback was amazing: children loved it! They just couldn't wait for the next chapter to be delivered - and that also applied to those who had originally thought that reading was not for them. 
But there was a small problem - my story was written in Finnish. 

Please don't misunderstand me - Finnish is a beautiful language. It is an old and rich language and it's the language I know the 
best. But I wanted my story to travel the world! So to begin with, I wanted to translate Spring Charmers into English.And that's why I'm here. 
My name is Katja Törmänen and I'm a writer and an illustrator from Finland. I wrote Spring Charmers without targeting my story to any particular age group. Instead I  thought whether I would like to read that story, and the end result is that both children and adults just love my story! I believe Spring Charmers is best suited for children between the ages 8 and 13, but of course every child is unique when it comes to reading. Spring Charmers is also well-suited to be read out loud, though it may be a bit too exciting as a bedtime story for the youngest...;)



There are 1-3 black-and-white illustrations in each chapter of Spring Charmers, and I've personally drawn every single illustration in the story. To be honest - if I would have had the money, I probably would have hired a professional illustrator to cooperate with me. But since I didn't, I was kind of enchanted about the idea of illustrating the book myself. After all, I was the only one who knew what all the characters, places and dragons should look like!







What I'm asking and what's in it for you?


So where does the money go? 
The money raised with this campaign goes to the editing and printing costs of the book. I'm going to translate Spring Charmers into English myself, and then hire a professional for proofreading the text. My husband and I both  have studied English at the university, so practically you will get two translators for the price of one ;)  
And I have already invested a lot into this book: my time, obviously,
for  writing and drawing (and redrawing). But also money: firstly to get a 
professional cover and layout for the original story written in Finnish, and then to set up 
the web site where the digital delivery takes place. I believe in Spring Charmers, I believe in this possibility to get children into reading,
 and therefore I'm ready to take the risk myself. However, your help will enable me to dedicate enough time for the translation process and then get the editing done.

<p><b>ABOUT THE PELEE ISLAND BOOK HOUSE &amp; WRITERS’
RETREAT</b><br/></p>
<p>My
name is Dawn Kresan, and I am the founder of the Pelee Island Book House &amp;
Writers’ Retreat. It has been my dream to create a writers’ retreat on Pelee
Island for over a decade. Pelee Island, Ontario, is renowned for its birding,
monarch migrations, sandy beaches, and serene beauty. Situated near the Canada/USA boundary between Sandusky,
Ohio and Essex County, Ontario, Pelee Island is the perfect setting for a
retreat. There are no other writing retreats like it! When not reading or
writing, participants might go for a bike ride to the lighthouse, visit the
Pelee Island Winery, walk along the beach, or listen to the birds and enjoy the
breeze from the lake. Home of the annual Springsong reading series hosted by
Margaret Atwood as well as the Island Unplugged music festival and the Artworks
artists’ outlet, Pelee is proud of its burgeoning arts community.</p>
<p>Taking
part in a Pelee Island writing retreat will give authors the opportunity to
focus on their work, free of distraction. Their fees include accommodations,
meals, and workshops, with the time and space needed to work on a manuscript
while benefiting from inclusion in a creative community. Each retreat offers
writers the chance to work on their own and also to take part in facilitated
workshop sessions, which will combine group discussion and individual text
critiques. The 7-day retreat will include two master classes, and the 5-day
retreat will have one master class. On an annual basis, one of the retreats
will be sponsored by Pelee Island Bird Observatory (PIBO), which will offer a
nature related writing workshop. Participants will go on a bird identification
walking tour and spend some time at the bird-banding station. Additional
options for all retreat participants, depending on booking dates, include bike
rentals, Island tours, wine tastings, vineyard tours, yoga classes, and Springsong
tickets. There will also be 6-day self-directed residencies, which are a low
cost alternative for writers who need time away to focus on a manuscript. There
will be no instructors or workshops, but plenty of time to write, read, walk,
and explore the Island.</p><p>Confirmed workshop leaders include Margaret Atwood, Cassidy McFadzean, Alissa York, Steven Heighton, Iain Reid, and Chuck Wendig. Every year there will be a variety of genres represented through the workshops — novels, poetry, memoir, graphic novels, sci-fi, horror, children's lit... and so on.</p>
<p><br/></p><p><b>WHAT YOUR DONATION WILL BE USED FOR</b></p><p>The retreats and residencies will begin in the spring
of 2017. The
funds raised will be used for the start-up costs of the writing program. Costs include promotion, websites, and advertising in literary journals. A lot of the promotion can be done on-line, though Facebook, blogs, and twitter. Those incentives take time, but not money, and I am willing to put in the work because I believe in this project. The bulk of the donation money will be put into paying the instructors for their workshop time and bringing them to Pelee Island. By bus, train, plane,  ferry, or some combination of! Authors should never be expected to do work pro bono or for the promotion of their work. Although a few can command a large sum of money, most authors are paid very little or no fee for readings. It is important that all professional writers are paid for their labour. I intend on creating an afternoon reading series, free and open to the public, where the instructors will read (and get paid for their reading), and where the participants in the workshop can read short pieces on the same stage as their mentor. This will give workshop participants the opportunity to ""try out"" their pieces and it may be the first time some of them publicly read. Donation money will be primarily used for instructor workshop fees, readings, travel, lodging, and catering for both instructors and writers. Three meals a day for a dozen writers over the course of a week means a lot of food, and a lot of coffee.</p><p>This is a one-time campaign to get things going. I don't want to apply for grants, or even worse — become reliant on them. After this initial year, there should be enough money flowing in at a regular basis that the retreats and residencies will  be paid through the participants tuition fees.</p><br/><div><b>PERKS MAKE GIVING REWARDING</b></div><div>
<br/><p>Perks
are offered in every price range, from $10 to thousands. For those interested in taking part in a
retreat or residency—if you give $100 now you’ll get 10% off a future booking,
and for $200 you’ll get a 20% discount. Why give a  donation now, when you can enrol later? Because you can save money and you are ensuring the success of the Pelee Island writing retreats. You can save $200 by pre-booking a
7-day retreat, and you’ll have five years in which to use it. Having the money upfront better allows me to budget the upcoming retreats and gives me a better idea of how many people are interested in enrolling. All this is useful from a promotional aspect. How much advertising do I need to do? There are only 12 spots available for each session, so pre-enrollement means I know my numbers and I know how hard I need to push. It also tells me which workshops are more popular and what genres are in demand. I can plan the following years's retreats accordingly.  There are lots of fun perks, from signed copies of books, vouchers for Pelee Island retailers, bookstore vouchers,   festival tickets, and even exclusive party invitations to hobnob with literary greats. How fun!</p>
<p>Please note that session 3, in both the spring and fall, is a special purchase that must be made through this IndieGoGo campaign. There have been some spots already taken in the Atwood session, which is why it is down to six spots left. There are 12 spots available in each session. Participants will be assigned a room with someone of their own gender. Travel is not included.<br/></p>

</div></div>","ABOUT THE PELEE ISLAND BOOK HOUSE & WRITERS’
RETREAT
My
name is Dawn Kresan, and I am the founder of the Pelee Island Book House &
Writers’ Retreat. It has been my dream to create a writers’ retreat on Pelee
Island for over a decade. Pelee Island, Ontario, is renowned for its birding,
monarch migrations, sandy beaches, and serene beauty. Situated near the Canada/USA boundary between Sandusky,
Ohio and Essex County, Ontario, Pelee Island is the perfect setting for a
retreat. There are no other writing retreats like it! When not reading or
writing, participants might go for a bike ride to the lighthouse, visit the
Pelee Island Winery, walk along the beach, or listen to the birds and enjoy the
breeze from the lake. Home of the annual Springsong reading series hosted by
Margaret Atwood as well as the Island Unplugged music festival and the Artworks
artists’ outlet, Pelee is proud of its burgeoning arts community.
Taking
part in a Pelee Island writing retreat will give authors the opportunity to
focus on their work, free of distraction. Their fees include accommodations,
meals, and workshops, with the time and space needed to work on a manuscript
while benefiting from inclusion in a creative community. Each retreat offers
writers the chance to work on their own and also to take part in facilitated
workshop sessions, which will combine group discussion and individual text
critiques. The 7-day retreat will include two master classes, and the 5-day
retreat will have one master class. On an annual basis, one of the retreats
will be sponsored by Pelee Island Bird Observatory (PIBO), which will offer a
nature related writing workshop. Participants will go on a bird identification
walking tour and spend some time at the bird-banding station. Additional
options for all retreat participants, depending on booking dates, include bike
rentals, Island tours, wine tastings, vineyard tours, yoga classes, and Springsong
tickets. There will also be 6-day self-directed residencies, which are a low
cost alternative for writers who need time away to focus on a manuscript. There
will be no instructors or workshops, but plenty of time to write, read, walk,
and explore the Island.Confirmed workshop leaders include Margaret Atwood, Cassidy McFadzean, Alissa York, Steven Heighton, Iain Reid, and Chuck Wendig. Every year there will be a variety of genres represented through the workshops — novels, poetry, memoir, graphic novels, sci-fi, horror, children's lit... and so on.
WHAT YOUR DONATION WILL BE USED FORThe retreats and residencies will begin in the spring
of 2017. The
funds raised will be used for the start-up costs of the writing program. Costs include promotion, websites, and advertising in literary journals. A lot of the promotion can be done on-line, though Facebook, blogs, and twitter. Those incentives take time, but not money, and I am willing to put in the work because I believe in this project. The bulk of the donation money will be put into paying the instructors for their workshop time and bringing them to Pelee Island. By bus, train, plane,  ferry, or some combination of! Authors should never be expected to do work pro bono or for the promotion of their work. Although a few can command a large sum of money, most authors are paid very little or no fee for readings. It is important that all professional writers are paid for their labour. I intend on creating an afternoon reading series, free and open to the public, where the instructors will read (and get paid for their reading), and where the participants in the workshop can read short pieces on the same stage as their mentor. This will give workshop participants the opportunity to ""try out"" their pieces and it may be the first time some of them publicly read. Donation money will be primarily used for instructor workshop fees, readings, travel, lodging, and catering for both instructors and writers. Three meals a day for a dozen writers over the course of a week means a lot of food, and a lot of coffee.This is a one-time campaign to get things going. I don't want to apply for grants, or even worse — become reliant on them. After this initial year, there should be enough money flowing in at a regular basis that the retreats and residencies will  be paid through the participants tuition fees.PERKS MAKE GIVING REWARDING
Perks
are offered in every price range, from $10 to thousands. For those interested in taking part in a
retreat or residency—if you give $100 now you’ll get 10% off a future booking,
and for $200 you’ll get a 20% discount. Why give a  donation now, when you can enrol later? Because you can save money and you are ensuring the success of the Pelee Island writing retreats. You can save $200 by pre-booking a
7-day retreat, and you’ll have five years in which to use it. Having the money upfront better allows me to budget the upcoming retreats and gives me a better idea of how many people are interested in enrolling. All this is useful from a promotional aspect. How much advertising do I need to do? There are only 12 spots available for each session, so pre-enrollement means I know my numbers and I know how hard I need to push. It also tells me which workshops are more popular and what genres are in demand. I can plan the following years's retreats accordingly.  There are lots of fun perks, from signed copies of books, vouchers for Pelee Island retailers, bookstore vouchers,   festival tickets, and even exclusive party invitations to hobnob with literary greats. How fun!
Please note that session 3, in both the spring and fall, is a special purchase that must be made through this IndieGoGo campaign. There have been some spots already taken in the Atwood session, which is why it is down to six spots left. There are 12 spots available in each session. Participants will be assigned a room with someone of their own gender. Travel is not included.

<p>*END UPDATE*</p>
<p>My name is Marty</p>
<p>I'm a bit of a poet,</p>
<p>And given the chance</p>
<p>I'd love to show it.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, I despised reading. My mom would sit me down with a book and tell me to read, and I would skim over the pages, counting to what I thought was an appropriate amount of time per page, and after a while, plop a bookmark in somewhere, and go off and play. Finally, in third grade, I picked up a copy of ""the Hobbit,"" and all of a sudden, reading wasn't so bad. I started reading more and more. Eventually, I came across the works of Shel Silverstein, and fell in love with poetry. Silverstein led me to Robert Frost, who led me to Edgar Allan Poe. Soon, I wasn't just reading it, I was writing it. I learned to love and appreciate all kinds of poetry, but the childish simplicity, and deep messages found in many of Silverstein's rhymes have always held the largest place of my poetic heart. <br/></p>
<p>I pull most of my inspiration from Shel, and have found myself styling many of my poems similar to his, but my particular life experiences are where I draw most of the differences. I grew up with four brothers and four sisters in a suburb of Chicago, but moved to West Michigan in my early teens. After graduating high school, I spent a semester at a private college before joining the military*. I served as a tank turret repairmen for a time, but have bounced around to fill other capacities. I was deployed for a year in Afghanistan, and will be deploying again before too long. Stateside, I have worked as a shoe salesman, a meat cutter, a vacuum salesman, a custom furniture builder, a bouncer, and, most recently, a husband.</p>
<p>Though I've changed jobs and titles several times, one of the few consistencies in my life has been my writing. I've dabbled in short stories, both fiction and non-fiction, but I keep coming back to my poems. Since I began writing, it's been a dream of mine to see my own words on a shelf alongside those same authors who inspired me to write. I want to be able to affect children the same way I was affected as a child. If even one person of any age reads my poems and finds excitement, joy, a bit of sadness, lots of laughter, and most importantly, hunger for more literature, then I will feel more than accomplished. My hope is to be able to reach more than one person, but even one inspired individual would be a wonderful thing.</p>
<p>Now, why do I need money to publish my book? Aren't there publishers out there who don't take money except out of sales? Well, yeah. The thing is, though, that after having some of the jobs I've had, I've learned to appreciate the feeling of working for myself. I don't want to have to go through the hassle of sending my manuscript to dozens of publishers, having to wait for who knows how long, just to maybe get some small kind of chance to get my book printed. With my next deployment on the horizon, I don't want to have to put things on hold, and have my manuscript get lost in the sauce while I'm out of the country. I've been building up the courage to do this for years, I don't want to wait longer, so I'm self-publishing via Amazon.com. It will be available through Amazon.com, Amazon Europe and UK, through Kindle, and some other retailers. I'm willing to bet that 1 of the last 5 books you bought was through an online retailer.</p>
<p>So how about it? Why not give an aspiring author the chance to inspire others?</p>
<p>A short example of my style:<br/></p>
<p>Tell lots of jokes</p>
<p>To lots of folks</p>
<p>To see all kinds of smiles.</p>
<p>To make amends</p>
<p>With long lost friends</p>
<p>Go those extra miles.</p>
<p>Treat others with care</p>
<p>Don't forget to share</p>
<p>And you won't regret it.</p>
<p>When you show others kindness</p>
<p>With loving blindness</p>
<p>Believe they won't forget it.</p>

<h3><u>Millennial Tales Summary</u></h3>
<p>Millennial Tales is a book of fables and other tales, beautifully illustrated, designed to teach the lessons particular to what the American millennial child needs to know. They're about growing up with unexpected hardship and learning to appreciate all that's at your disposal. In four spirited stories, you will learn about the lives of Americans of many walks as life gives them some important lessons. These stories are longing to be heard, to give voice to the lived experiences that go unnoticed every day.</p>

<h3><u>Our Journey to Publishing</u></h3>
<p>This project has been up and running for months now. Millennial Tales has gone through a name change, many edits, and falling short of our original campaign goal. Yet, throughout all of these changes and trials, our team has acquired a number of important assets.</p>
<p>We have acquired a consultant. She has provided us with a great deal of insight in this realm of publishing. Having had her available to us for several months now, we have identify resources that are critical for our publishing. In doing so, we have streamlined our process and removed some of our cost as we've invested more efficient means of reaching our audience and publishing this first installment of Millennial Fables.</p>
<p>Additionally, we've identified our most important assets our human assets. In our campaign we were blessed to find some many people willing to give and excited to support this project. These were people that we knew personally and some who heard and wanted to support. These relationships are integral to our success and we are so grateful that these people are still looking for their chance to support.</p>
<p>That said, this is our final campaign! We are taking <strong>31</strong> days to raise <strong>$1,200 </strong>through the support of <strong>30</strong> people. The funds raised in this campaign will go towards illustration, publishing costs, cost of shipping of our perks, perks and other merchandise, and towards reaching schools, children, and communities from Atlanta to Chicago.</p>
<p>With your donations, you'll be awarded perks like: <strong>Digital Artwork, Concept art from the author and illustrator, Posters, Book Marks, A first edition copy of Millennial Tales, A name in the special thanks page of the book, etc.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>Our Impact</u></h3>
<p>The impact that the Millennial Tales team seeks in this project is twofold. When I originally wrote these fables, I wanted to reach a generation of children who I believed lived in a culture that was drifting farther and farther away from its moralistic center. The environment that modern children are being exposed to nowadays has departed from a general atmosphere of insulated good and has instead adopted an atmosphere that, while good, lacks a sense of order. Young children haven't heard the older tales that teach morality. It isn't popular television or music for them anymore. More than ever the onus is on the parent to provide an environment that is intellectually stimulating and morally enriching to their children. They can't rely on media or schools to provide this gratis especially if they don't have the means to afford the best of these things. Children haven't heard the folktales or the nursery rhymes. They don't remember the fairy tales, and the ones they've heard have new lessons. They don't know songs like ""I love you, you love me"". Millennial Tales was created for my very small students who I could never assume knew the stories or lessons that they needed to know, regardless of their age. Millennial Tales is not seeking to replace the foundation that we as a culture have for our children, but rather to fill the cracks in it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Secondly, because this project is about stories inspired from the American life, it was important that these fables reflected the American people. The American people are diverse. They are wildly creative and adaptive. I sought to show this in the pages of Millennial Tales by tasking our wonderful illustrator with drawing these fables in 4 completely different art styles with a diverse cast of characters. This was no small feat! In creating this book, we looked at art inspired from American cartoons, Japan, France, Mexico, and pockets of American culture across the nation. At the end of the day, when Millennial Tales reaches a child's hands, we want them to be able to see themselves in the pages and thereby foster a greater understanding of the lessons they teach. If Millennial Tales succeeds, the young ones that it reaches will sooner become the intelligent, compassionate, altruistic individuals that they're meant to be.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now, the primary purpose of this project is to get these stories into the hands of children. We are based primarily in the Metro Atlanta Region and the greater Chicagoland Area. We would like to see our greatest impact in these areas.</p>

</div></div>","Millennial Tales Summary
Millennial Tales is a book of fables and other tales, beautifully illustrated, designed to teach the lessons particular to what the American millennial child needs to know. They're about growing up with unexpected hardship and learning to appreciate all that's at your disposal. In four spirited stories, you will learn about the lives of Americans of many walks as life gives them some important lessons. These stories are longing to be heard, to give voice to the lived experiences that go unnoticed every day.
 
Gifts of the Shopkeeper 

Three children fall on hard times. Three gifts give them the inspiration to make it through.
 
Sarah the Contrary

Sarah is a contrarian who always tries to do things her way, even against her parent's sage advise.
 
Isaac and the Summer Storm

Isaac following a storm and gaining some friends along the way.
 
The Governor's Daughter

Alyssa accepts the help of a mysterious little girl in choosing who she loves most.

 

Our Journey to Publishing
This project has been up and running for months now. Millennial Tales has gone through a name change, many edits, and falling short of our original campaign goal. Yet, throughout all of these changes and trials, our team has acquired a number of important assets.
We have acquired a consultant. She has provided us with a great deal of insight in this realm of publishing. Having had her available to us for several months now, we have identify resources that are critical for our publishing. In doing so, we have streamlined our process and removed some of our cost as we've invested more efficient means of reaching our audience and publishing this first installment of Millennial Fables.
Additionally, we've identified our most important assets our human assets. In our campaign we were blessed to find some many people willing to give and excited to support this project. These were people that we knew personally and some who heard and wanted to support. These relationships are integral to our success and we are so grateful that these people are still looking for their chance to support.
That said, this is our final campaign! We are taking 31 days to raise $1,200 through the support of 30 people. The funds raised in this campaign will go towards illustration, publishing costs, cost of shipping of our perks, perks and other merchandise, and towards reaching schools, children, and communities from Atlanta to Chicago.
With your donations, you'll be awarded perks like: Digital Artwork, Concept art from the author and illustrator, Posters, Book Marks, A first edition copy of Millennial Tales, A name in the special thanks page of the book, etc.
 

Our Impact
The impact that the Millennial Tales team seeks in this project is twofold. When I originally wrote these fables, I wanted to reach a generation of children who I believed lived in a culture that was drifting farther and farther away from its moralistic center. The environment that modern children are being exposed to nowadays has departed from a general atmosphere of insulated good and has instead adopted an atmosphere that, while good, lacks a sense of order. Young children haven't heard the older tales that teach morality. It isn't popular television or music for them anymore. More than ever the onus is on the parent to provide an environment that is intellectually stimulating and morally enriching to their children. They can't rely on media or schools to provide this gratis especially if they don't have the means to afford the best of these things. Children haven't heard the folktales or the nursery rhymes. They don't remember the fairy tales, and the ones they've heard have new lessons. They don't know songs like ""I love you, you love me"". Millennial Tales was created for my very small students who I could never assume knew the stories or lessons that they needed to know, regardless of their age. Millennial Tales is not seeking to replace the foundation that we as a culture have for our children, but rather to fill the cracks in it.
 
Secondly, because this project is about stories inspired from the American life, it was important that these fables reflected the American people. The American people are diverse. They are wildly creative and adaptive. I sought to show this in the pages of Millennial Tales by tasking our wonderful illustrator with drawing these fables in 4 completely different art styles with a diverse cast of characters. This was no small feat! In creating this book, we looked at art inspired from American cartoons, Japan, France, Mexico, and pockets of American culture across the nation. At the end of the day, when Millennial Tales reaches a child's hands, we want them to be able to see themselves in the pages and thereby foster a greater understanding of the lessons they teach. If Millennial Tales succeeds, the young ones that it reaches will sooner become the intelligent, compassionate, altruistic individuals that they're meant to be.
 
Now, the primary purpose of this project is to get these stories into the hands of children. We are based primarily in the Metro Atlanta Region and the greater Chicagoland Area. We would like to see our greatest impact in these areas.

<h3>The Ultimate Guide to Getting Your Writing in Print &amp; Getting Paid for It</h3>
<p>Ever since I learned that my full-time hobby could also become a lucrative part-time job, I've lived and breathed, thought, dreamed, ate, and slept writing and publishing. I've attended conferences and retreats, read books and blog posts, joined forums and critique groups, experienced and observed in all forms the process of getting books to readers. To date, I've published a short science fiction novel with an indie publisher and have over 70 short story publications in venues such as Every Day Fiction, Beneath Ceaseless Skies, and the Sword and Sorceress series. I've been a writer, a beta reader who helped several friends find publishers for their stories, and an intern assisting a published author with her first novel. Through it all, I've tried to help others achieve the same: to fulfill their dream of finding readers and making money from their writing. </p>
<p>The book started from a collection of blog and forum posts I've shared over the years, which I'm now revising and expanding. When finished, it will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tips for defeating writer's block and finishing your story</li>
<li>Things to look out for as you revise to make the strongest manuscript possible</li>
<li>How to find markets for your writing and keep track of your submissions</li>
<li>How to concisely and engagingly describe your story to agents, editors, and potential readers</li>
<li>The relative merits of submitting to a press or self-publishing, as described by someone who has done both. The media is always eager to tell you about the latest self-publishing bestseller, but what is life like for the vast majority who never see the New York Times top ten?</li>
<li>Scams to avoid when getting your work published</li>
<li>How to advertise your work, including tips on everything from author's websites (and who actually reads your blog) to promotional bookmarks, plus the outline of a marketing plan for a novel</li>
</ul>
<p>The book offers an on-the-ground view of publishing, with a focus on using the internet and inexpensive resources (after all, writers should make money off their writing, not pay for it!). Its holistic perspective aims to build skills that will continue to assist writers at any stage of their careers.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The goals of this campaign are twofold: to raise funds to make publishing and distributing the book a faster and easier process, and to offer interested readers a chance to 'pre-order'.</p>
<p>The smallest amount IndieGoGo allows as a goal is $500, so that's what I'm setting for this campaign. I believe I can get the project done for less than that, but this also provides a chance for everyone interested in getting a copy of the book or a manuscript review to sign up for one.  My needs for the project are:</p>
<ul>
<li>$40 for formatting the ebook through Smashwords</li>
<li>$40 for expanded distribution with CreateSpace</li>
<li>$70 for formatting and distributing the ebook on Kindle, through CreateSpace</li>
<li>$50 for cover art</li>
<li>$125 to purchase an ISBN (needed for some distribution channels)</li>
<li>$110 to purchase a download of Microsoft Word as I replace my computer (a necessity for formatting and preparing the manuscript)</li>
</ul>
<p>That's $435. Further funds will be used to pay for perk fulfillment and IndieGoGo and card fees. With more funding, I will be able to provide a better quality product (above and beyond the text, which I will edit to perfection no matter what) in a shorter timeframe. Even if this campaign's goal isn't met, I will still publish the book, just with a simpler cover, more basic formatting, and without the ISBN. Also, even if the goal is met or exceeded, if I find a more inexpensive way to publish the book at the same level of quality, I will go for that (this may mean different cover art, alternative distribution, or going without the ISBN after all). </p>
<p>If this campaign's goal is met, donations will continue to be accepted as a way to allow orders of the book and to give everyone who wants to a chance to sign up for the first chapter, short story, and novel edits. </p>
<p>The perks:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, I'm offering the chance to pre-order copies of the book. The ebook will retail for $4.99 and the print book for $6.99 + shipping, equivalent to the donation amounts for those perks.</li>
<li>This is your only chance to get a signed copy of the book, unless you want to order a print copy and then hunt me down in person. </li>
<li>I do freelance manuscript editing as a part-time job (it was also part of my internship during my last undergraduate semester). My suggestions have helped several writer friends land their first sale. Along with the developmental and line-by-line critiques, these perks include an ebook copy of the <em>Starter Guide.</em>
</li>
<li>I should note this campaign is your <em>only </em>chance to get a First Chapter review of the first 4000 words of your manuscript. Usually I only offer this service as part of a larger package, and for the first 2500-3000 words. If the First Chapter review sells out, I may begin offering it outside of this campaign.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>FAQs:</h3>
<p><strong>Q. If your book is about professional writing, why are you self-publishing it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>I define 'professional' as any writing the writer is paid for, and if self-publishing is successful, then the writer gets paid! Of course this means the <em>Guide </em>has an entire section dedicated specifically to self-publishing, and I'll amend that section with what I learn from this experience. I've chosen self-publishing for this project especially because I like the ability to determine my own content, design, distribution, and sales price. I feel confident in my ability to market this specific nonfiction work without a publisher.</p>
<p><strong>Q. I haven't finished my story--is it too early to buy your book?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>No! The <em>Starter Guide for Professional Writer </em>contains advice for how to complete your work in progress (writer's block or writer's schmock), revise and polish your prose to make a solid manuscript, and then what to consider as you get it published. Having some idea what comes next in the process will guide how you write your story, and it's never too early to learn the basics of a professional writing career.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: I've already written my story--is it too late to read the book?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>No! Now comes the real fun as you prepare to submit your story to editors and/or agents (or to readers directly). This step is at the heart of the <em>Guide</em>, as it's what makes the professional writer a professional. Tips on how to market the story once it's published--including steps you can take to build a platform right now--and advice on writing your next work are a bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I've already finished and published my book--it's too late now, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Not at all! The <em>Guide </em>still contains plenty of advice on how to market your book, work on the next one (avoiding the ""curse of the second novel""), and offers a broad perspective on your options if you choose to publish your next book differently. It also offers some perspective on what your first publishing process was like--as it can be a bewildering experience to go through. A professional writer's career usually consists of more than one story, so the <em>Guide </em>will assist you as you go to work on your next one. And the next. And the next.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I'm Stephen King, J.K. Rowling, and J.A. Konrath. All of them at once. They're all the nom de plumes of Myself, a multi-bestselling writer in the shadows.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Okay, you probably don't need the help of my book. You still might find it a fun read, though (and I'll keep your secret).</p>
<p><strong>Q. I have a story I want critiqued that is more than 8,000 words and less than 50,000 (or more than 100,000). Am I out of luck?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. </strong>Not at all--I do offer novella critiques (my own published book is a novella), though I chose to list just the staple review options as perks for this campaign. I also critique epic-length novels, for a slightly higher fee than the standard. Actual fees will depend on the length of the manuscript and the level of service desired. For more information, click the link to my website (linked to at the bottom of this page) and contact me at the email address provided. Mention this campaign and I'll be sure to throw in a free ebook download along with your edit!</p>
<p><strong>Q. What's the worst that could happen with this campaign?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. </strong>I'm glad you asked!</p>
<h3><strong>Worst Case Scenarios</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>I might not meet the funding goal</strong>
<ul>
<li>The goal should be more than enough to meet my publishing needs; however, if I don't raise enough to cover a particular service (like formatting or cover art), I can do the formatting myself using Smashword's useful guide and my own time, bribe an artist friend into designing my cover, fast for a week to save money for distribution, use ISBNs from CreateSpace and PubIt rather than buy my own, etc. The core of the book, its text, will be a high-quality, high-density informational guide unaffected by any changes to its packaging, although I will ensure the package is durable and attractive as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>The book might flop</strong>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span>It might, but that won't affect you. You will get your copy and use its wisdom to launch your writing career whether or not anybody else decides to do the same (their loss, alas!).</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>The book might suck</strong>
<ul>
<li>Anything's possible, but I don't believe this'll happen. I've been writing and getting my work published--and helping others do the same--for over five years. As this campaign runs I am putting the completed manuscript through a grueling revision, though I've already <span style="""">received</span> rave feedback on excerpts that I've shared on my blog and writing forums. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>I might waste my money </strong>
<ul>
<li>The most you can spend ordering a copy of the book is $15, and I made more than that on my first day of selling short fiction (seriously--and I'll share that tidbit of autobiography in more detail in the <em>Guide)</em>. I guarantee that, following the advice in this book, you will be able to make at least $20 off your writing (provided you finish the stories) and that will recoup even the cost of a signed copy + shipping. I so much gaurantee it that if you buy the book, read it, and find yourself struggling to apply its advice, you're invited to email me and get step-by-step guidance to recoup your investment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>The Apocalypse may come about as Cthulhu Itself rises from the deeps to take advantage of the great perks offered in this campaign.</strong>

<li><span>Oops. </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>Let your writer friends know about this book and campaign! IndieGoGo offers a lot of easy tools for sharing.</li>
<li>If you can't buy the book now, buy it when it's out!</li>
<li>Reviewing books is something you do for other readers, not the author, but this author sure appreciates it when people talk about her books</li>
<li>If you're not a writer but more a reader, you might check out <a href=""http://theresearkenberg.blogspot.com/p/publications-list.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my published stories</a>.</li>
<li>Consider Eileen Flanagan's advice for <a href=""http://www.eileenflanagan.com/blog/2009/7/24/if-you-love-a-writer.html)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""If You Love An Author,""</a> even if you in <span style="""">actuality</span> feel nothing more than vague affection for me. </li>
<li>If you have any leads, advice, or connections in the way of formatting ebooks, setting up distribution, or developing cover art (perhaps you or a friend are looking to build up a portfolio), get in touch! And maybe I can help you with your own project. </li>

The relative merits of submitting to a press or self-publishing, as described by someone who has done both. The media is always eager to tell you about the latest self-publishing bestseller, but what is life like for the vast majority who never see the New York Times top ten?
Scams to avoid when getting your work published
How to advertise your work, including tips on everything from author's websites (and who actually reads your blog) to promotional bookmarks, plus the outline of a marketing plan for a novel

The book offers an on-the-ground view of publishing, with a focus on using the internet and inexpensive resources (after all, writers should make money off their writing, not pay for it!). Its holistic perspective aims to build skills that will continue to assist writers at any stage of their careers.


What I Need & What You Get
The goals of this campaign are twofold: to raise funds to make publishing and distributing the book a faster and easier process, and to offer interested readers a chance to 'pre-order'.
The smallest amount IndieGoGo allows as a goal is $500, so that's what I'm setting for this campaign. I believe I can get the project done for less than that, but this also provides a chance for everyone interested in getting a copy of the book or a manuscript review to sign up for one.  My needs for the project are:

$40 for formatting the ebook through Smashwords
$40 for expanded distribution with CreateSpace
$70 for formatting and distributing the ebook on Kindle, through CreateSpace
$50 for cover art
$125 to purchase an ISBN (needed for some distribution channels)
$110 to purchase a download of Microsoft Word as I replace my computer (a necessity for formatting and preparing the manuscript)

That's $435. Further funds will be used to pay for perk fulfillment and IndieGoGo and card fees. With more funding, I will be able to provide a better quality product (above and beyond the text, which I will edit to perfection no matter what) in a shorter timeframe. Even if this campaign's goal isn't met, I will still publish the book, just with a simpler cover, more basic formatting, and without the ISBN. Also, even if the goal is met or exceeded, if I find a more inexpensive way to publish the book at the same level of quality, I will go for that (this may mean different cover art, alternative distribution, or going without the ISBN after all). 
If this campaign's goal is met, donations will continue to be accepted as a way to allow orders of the book and to give everyone who wants to a chance to sign up for the first chapter, short story, and novel edits. 
The perks:

First, I'm offering the chance to pre-order copies of the book. The ebook will retail for $4.99 and the print book for $6.99 + shipping, equivalent to the donation amounts for those perks.
This is your only chance to get a signed copy of the book, unless you want to order a print copy and then hunt me down in person. 
I do freelance manuscript editing as a part-time job (it was also part of my internship during my last undergraduate semester). My suggestions have helped several writer friends land their first sale. Along with the developmental and line-by-line critiques, these perks include an ebook copy of the Starter Guide.

I should note this campaign is your only chance to get a First Chapter review of the first 4000 words of your manuscript. Usually I only offer this service as part of a larger package, and for the first 2500-3000 words. If the First Chapter review sells out, I may begin offering it outside of this campaign.


FAQs:
Q. If your book is about professional writing, why are you self-publishing it?
A: I define 'professional' as any writing the writer is paid for, and if self-publishing is successful, then the writer gets paid! Of course this means the Guide has an entire section dedicated specifically to self-publishing, and I'll amend that section with what I learn from this experience. I've chosen self-publishing for this project especially because I like the ability to determine my own content, design, distribution, and sales price. I feel confident in my ability to market this specific nonfiction work without a publisher.
Q. I haven't finished my story--is it too early to buy your book?
A: No! The Starter Guide for Professional Writer contains advice for how to complete your work in progress (writer's block or writer's schmock), revise and polish your prose to make a solid manuscript, and then what to consider as you get it published. Having some idea what comes next in the process will guide how you write your story, and it's never too early to learn the basics of a professional writing career. 
Q: I've already written my story--is it too late to read the book?
A: No! Now comes the real fun as you prepare to submit your story to editors and/or agents (or to readers directly). This step is at the heart of the Guide, as it's what makes the professional writer a professional. Tips on how to market the story once it's published--including steps you can take to build a platform right now--and advice on writing your next work are a bonus.
Q: I've already finished and published my book--it's too late now, right?
A: Not at all! The Guide still contains plenty of advice on how to market your book, work on the next one (avoiding the ""curse of the second novel""), and offers a broad perspective on your options if you choose to publish your next book differently. It also offers some perspective on what your first publishing process was like--as it can be a bewildering experience to go through. A professional writer's career usually consists of more than one story, so the Guide will assist you as you go to work on your next one. And the next. And the next.
Q: I'm Stephen King, J.K. Rowling, and J.A. Konrath. All of them at once. They're all the nom de plumes of Myself, a multi-bestselling writer in the shadows.
A: Okay, you probably don't need the help of my book. You still might find it a fun read, though (and I'll keep your secret).
Q. I have a story I want critiqued that is more than 8,000 words and less than 50,000 (or more than 100,000). Am I out of luck?
A. Not at all--I do offer novella critiques (my own published book is a novella), though I chose to list just the staple review options as perks for this campaign. I also critique epic-length novels, for a slightly higher fee than the standard. Actual fees will depend on the length of the manuscript and the level of service desired. For more information, click the link to my website (linked to at the bottom of this page) and contact me at the email address provided. Mention this campaign and I'll be sure to throw in a free ebook download along with your edit!
Q. What's the worst that could happen with this campaign?
A. I'm glad you asked!
Worst Case Scenarios


I might not meet the funding goal

The goal should be more than enough to meet my publishing needs; however, if I don't raise enough to cover a particular service (like formatting or cover art), I can do the formatting myself using Smashword's useful guide and my own time, bribe an artist friend into designing my cover, fast for a week to save money for distribution, use ISBNs from CreateSpace and PubIt rather than buy my own, etc. The core of the book, its text, will be a high-quality, high-density informational guide unaffected by any changes to its packaging, although I will ensure the package is durable and attractive as well.



The book might flop

It might, but that won't affect you. You will get your copy and use its wisdom to launch your writing career whether or not anybody else decides to do the same (their loss, alas!).



The book might suck

Anything's possible, but I don't believe this'll happen. I've been writing and getting my work published--and helping others do the same--for over five years. As this campaign runs I am putting the completed manuscript through a grueling revision, though I've already received rave feedback on excerpts that I've shared on my blog and writing forums. 



I might waste my money 

The most you can spend ordering a copy of the book is $15, and I made more than that on my first day of selling short fiction (seriously--and I'll share that tidbit of autobiography in more detail in the Guide). I guarantee that, following the advice in this book, you will be able to make at least $20 off your writing (provided you finish the stories) and that will recoup even the cost of a signed copy + shipping. I so much gaurantee it that if you buy the book, read it, and find yourself struggling to apply its advice, you're invited to email me and get step-by-step guidance to recoup your investment.



The Apocalypse may come about as Cthulhu Itself rises from the deeps to take advantage of the great perks offered in this campaign.

Oops. 



Other Ways You Can Help

Let your writer friends know about this book and campaign! IndieGoGo offers a lot of easy tools for sharing.
If you can't buy the book now, buy it when it's out!
Reviewing books is something you do for other readers, not the author, but this author sure appreciates it when people talk about her books
If you're not a writer but more a reader, you might check out my published stories.
Consider Eileen Flanagan's advice for ""If You Love An Author,"" even if you in actuality feel nothing more than vague affection for me. 
If you have any leads, advice, or connections in the way of formatting ebooks, setting up distribution, or developing cover art (perhaps you or a friend are looking to build up a portfolio), get in touch! And maybe I can help you with your own project.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>Now this book helps everybody to understand the how's and why's of love. It helps to keep on moving without pain when you break up with somebody and explains why being positive and full of love is so important for your environment and yourself. It also gives courage to do in life what you ""feel"" you should do.</p>
<p>Yes, it is a kind of motivational book. Yet, it differs from similar books in that it uses pictures and imagery to explain what love is all about; and we all know that an image is worth more than a thousand words! So it sticks life long in the head. This book is loaded with facts, stories, and experiments about emotions, and it reveals some secrets of the laws of love.</p>
<p>Oh yes you will laugh, wonder and smile.</p>

Well, this book is about love and that is a subject you don't learn about at school. Instead you learn all about mathematics, science, language,... but about emotions?No, this is a subject you have to figure out yourself and after many years you may eventually end up knowing something more about it. Yet, we all know that love is a bumpy road, with lots of tears and pain, that we will all have to march through.
Now this book helps everybody to understand the how's and why's of love. It helps to keep on moving without pain when you break up with somebody and explains why being positive and full of love is so important for your environment and yourself. It also gives courage to do in life what you ""feel"" you should do.
Yes, it is a kind of motivational book. Yet, it differs from similar books in that it uses pictures and imagery to explain what love is all about; and we all know that an image is worth more than a thousand words! So it sticks life long in the head. This book is loaded with facts, stories, and experiments about emotions, and it reveals some secrets of the laws of love.
Oh yes you will laugh, wonder and smile.


Some questions that ""Love Vibrations"" answers:
Do you know that when you get dumped the reason is very logical?Do you know the different sound beats of the heart?Do you know what to do when you are alone and have a heart attack?Do you know the heart pulses of our different species on earth?Do you know the most romantic love story in the world?Do you know the law of vibration of love?Do you know the law of rhythm of love?Do you know the law of polarity of love?Do you know what is wrong with lists of love?Do you know why we don't have to be afraid when we are single?Do you know why they hang padlocks on bridges?Do you know all types of relationships?Do you know when you break up a relationship, it is the right thing to do?Do you know the road of love?Do you know the crush table?Do you know the percentage money makes a guy more attractive?Do you know the relationship between a younger partner and life expectancy?Do you know who is on your side from the moment you live till the moment you die? Do you know the influence of words?Do you know the energies of words? Do you know the percentage they will cheat on you in your relationship?Do you know the rice experiment?Do you know my results with the rice experiment?Do you know by how much your chances of divorce increase when you know someone who is divorced?Do you know what Leonardo Da Vinci, Einstein and Nicolas Tesla had in common?Do you know Cleve Baxter's amazing experiment with plants?Do you know the experiment of the two cabbage plants and hate?Do you know the color of rose you may never give to a girl and why?Do you know the top 5 regrets when you die?

So many of you have asked me this question.  A lot of you know I've been working on a book about my family's work on the Panama and the Canal and life on the Canal Zone. The book is called Where There Is Pride In Belonging, which is the slogan for my father's high school alumni association from La Boca in Panama.

Be Bigger! Help Me Shout!
Sometimes you are called to be larger than you envision. If I
could, I'd sit back writing snarky articles about stuff I see on the subway and
things that puzzle me. I’d be the black Ellen on paper and the web and chill.
But I believe we are all called to do more than what's comfortable. I have been
called to tell this story. Most of the books written about
the Panama Canal’s construction talk about Teddy Roosevelt’s vision, about the
marvel of American ingenuity and engineering it is, considered the 8th wonder of the
world. But here's what they don't say:
-200,000 black laborers recruited from the West Indies
-60,000 of those from Barbados
-Every single one of those black workers lived under segregation on the Canal Zone --pay scales, housing,
bathrooms, water fountains, schools for children of black labor 
- black workers often worked 14-hour days at  a dime an
hour for digging in 100 degree heat and exposing themselves to disease
 One of those workers was Reginald McPherson Dottin, my grandfather. He arrived at 19 years old and worked through the construction and was one of the few black laborers who wasn’t forced off the Canal Zone at the  end of construction. He continued working for the Canal and retired at 62. After 44 years of service he received a $45/month pension in 1953, the most he could get as a black worker. There have been so many voices unheard
in our history, so many everyday heroes who have surmounted ignorance and
prejudice to build the lives we are allowed to have. 
 With your help I can live out this vision.  When Where There Is Pride In Belonging is
published I will be working to create a curriculum about this hidden history in
the public schools and lecturing around the country, being the humbled but
honored voice of my grandfather and the thousands of men like him. Support the
mission.  Help me shout!

PRINTING OF ISSUE THREE DELAYED
 

Dear Readers,
 

It is with mild
annoyance that I write you this message. For around the last 6 months our team
have been working tirelessly on the creation of Gorilla Film Magazine. So far we have produced two shiny issues, a pleasant evening of short films and a stupendous Treasure Hunt.
 

Issue three has been
in production for some time now, content flooding in from far and wide. We’ve
been in cahoots with a learning disabled film festival, we have the latest on a
brand new stereoscopic 3D animation being produced right on our doorstep in
East London- which promises to share how, using only After Effects, one can
make their own 3D motion pictures. There’s the top five alternatives
to summer blockbusters and the usual smattering of hints and tips for all your
filmmaking needs, plus reviews of some of our favourite short films. 
 

Gorilla Film Magazine however is facing a problem. We have
failed to raise enough funds to print
issue three. Do not fear, this is by no means the end, merely a small blip, a
slight delay while we establish our footing in the world of the magazine flim
flam.
 

So what the hell are we doing to sort things out you might
ask? And how can I, your faithful / loving / indifferent reader, be
of assistance?
 

Please note that our team is unanimously against putting a
price on Gorilla. We will fight to the end to keep it a free publication. As we feel this is the best way to keep
our magazine as assessable as possible, plus we don’t really like the idea of
talking about no-budget filmmaking and doing things on a tight budget and then
charging people a fiver to read about it. Perhaps we are being idealistic and
foolish… All I say to this is that it would not be the first time we have been called
these things. 
 

So in a very long-winded way, what I am trying to say is, WE
NEED YOUR HELP.
Even the smallest donation will help to keep our magazine
alive and in print. This is only a temporary solution, while we explore new
avenues to generate funds.

 

In the mean time, Gorilla
is ploughing on. have just set-up a new Blog which we will endeavour to update as often as
possible. We have another Monkey with a Movie Camera short film night in the planning. A 46-hour film jam competition coming in June, register here. Plus much more….
 

Thank you for your time.

</div><p><b>Pontus J. Back</b></p><p>My name is Pontus J. Back, from Vasa, Finland. Since the age of 12 I was filled with fear of death and tried to numb the fear with alcohol. I was only sixteen years old when I already was an alcoholic. I had one dream and that was to become a rock star. For 15 years I toured around the world and I worked with musicians from bands such as Whitesnake, Status Quo, Molly Hatchet, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Cinderella to name a few. My life was a mess and I was a heavy drinker and I was now also using drugs.</p><p><b>The miracle</b></p><p>In 2006 when I had tried everything I wanted to give Jesus a try as a friend had told me about Him for a period of 16 years. I received Him into my life and immediately He started to help me. I fell back and in February 2007 I was laying on my deathbed at the hospital in Vasa, Finland with incurable damages on my liver, kidneys and pancreas. I had several bleeding ulcers as well as 2 gallons of fluid in my stomach that was coming out through my skin. According to the doctors there were no hope for me to survive.</p><p>One night I met Jesus and He told me to do what I am doing today and I have been doing that for seven years full time now. It has been the best seven years of my life and I have a story to tell and songs to sing about what took place in my life.</p><p>To see a life get changed and one soul get saved is worth way more than all the money in the world and my prayer is that this is something we could do together!</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Mission America 2014</b></p><p>Just a short testimony about our last missions trip to the USA in March 2014. We spent one week at the <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Daytona Bike Week and served together with Music For The Soul Ministries. After that we had 11 meetings </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">within five days in prisons, drug rehabs, a ranch for children in need as well as a few churches.</span></p><p>One of the strongest memories was in one of the prisons we did. We were told not to pray with the inmates so <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I just shared my testimony and sang some songs. They were all listening and at the end of every meeting I usually </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">give the inmates an opportunity to ask questions. Many questions are related to forgiveness and forgiving themselves.</span></p><p>This day one of the inmates asked me if I remember the prayer I prayed when I got saved. - Of course I said and it <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">became natural to lead them into the sinner prayer. I told everyone who said the prayer and meant it with all their hearts </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">that I wanted to give them a hug. While many of the inmates walked out there were still around 20 you men who wanted </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">a hug and that day those gave their lives to Jesus. We saw people receive Christ into their lives almost every day and God </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">confirmed to me why He wants me to visit USA twice a year. It is just grace that God is using someone like me.</span></p><p><b>Dates:</b> </p><p>November 1st until December 9th</p><p><b>Where:</b> </p><p>Texas November 1st until November 14th</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Florida November 15th until December 9th</span></p><p><b>Mission: </b></p><p>To share my testimony and music at the different locations.

We have also featured over 120 artists from Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, France, Israel, Japan, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Spain, and United Kingdom, among many others.</p>

<p>Our approach to the Issue Nº1 goes back to the basics of Parallel Planets: monochrome matters, parallel perspectives, and spatial subjects. We spoke to our favourite artists whom we’ve featured since our website launched last October 2013 and they agreed to contribute something that coincides with our manifesto – all of which are exclusive and have never been published.</p>
<p>Aside from putting the spotlight on our previously featured artists, we are also going to include special articles and photo essays by our staff. Issue Nº1 is going to be a mishmash of all things creative the way you haven’t seen before. We plan on releasing it by mid-2015.</p>
<p>However, we don’t want to spoil the sense of surprise that you’ll experience when you flick through the “colourless” pages of Issue Nº1, so we’ll leave most things unannounced until you get your eyes and hands on the actual book.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> <i></i></p>
<p>The magazine industry is a challenging one but we, over at Parallel Planets, are sincere and starving to conspire with your Universe. We hope that this Indiegogo campaign will help Parallel Planets gain more readership, establish a worldwide community, and create a space – both virtually and tangibly – for people to explore, share, and appreciate creativity from a new perspective.</p>
<p>Parallel Planets is independent and currently ad-free but we are also working to build relationships with advertisers and sponsors to ensure that we’ll be printing for the years to come.

I have written the first two books to inspire readers to delve into long, nostalgic, and hopefully, enlightening conversations with their loved ones.  The first book will be published by May of 2019. It has been beautifully illustrated by Xitlhali Treviño (@xitlhali_trevino on Instagram) and is being designed by Jud Burgess (@judburgess on Instagram).  The book will be available in print and will be sold online, primarily. </p><p>By contributing to this campaign, you will be helping to pay for:</p><ul>
<li>the illustrator’s advance</li>
<li>graphic design</li>
<li>logo design</li>
<li>proof prints</li>
<li>rewards for contributors of this campaign </li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Tonya McClearin. I grew up in Dayton, Ohio, one of six children. As an overweight child I faced bullying from other children and adults in my family. Then there was the sexual abuse. As a child, I tried to forget what I endured. I wanted to pretend it wasn't happening. I was an angry child. I would fight anyone that posed as a threat, even as an adult. It wasn't until my own two children were nearly grown that I found out that I needed to examine who and what I had become. I have always known the was a nice, sincere and gentle person on the inside, now I needed to bring that person to the surface. When I finally stopped and looked in the mirror, physically looked in the mirror, the first time I didn't recognize who that person was. It wasn't until I took a second look that I realized the person I wanted to become. I knew my life was not going in the direction I had desired for myself. It was time for a change. My connection with God gave me the strength to find the true me, the person I was always meant to be. Finally, I discovered that I deserve to live my life the way I had always wanted it to be.</p>
<p>Writing this book has given me a purpose in life. It has shown me how I can help others, not just through my writing, but as a future speaker who is willing to share the uncertainty of the past, and hope for the future. My trust in God has only become stronger as I share the often painful and burdensome reality of my past. Through God's strength I have learned that even in the most dire of circumstance you can overcome anything, and that we are all loved, no matter what choices we make in life.</p>
<p>Your contribution to this project will help me to establish myself as an author, mentor and speaker. Something I had never dreamed of being just a short time ago.  I hope to encourage and inspire others to achieve their goals, not matter what walk of life they may come from. I am ready to start a new journey as I forgo the past.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>I am seeking $2,500 to cover the cost of editing, printing, typesetting, and publishing of my book. Part of the funds will also cover the cost of the book launching. I want to start of on the right foot by making this book a celebration of my life.  </p>
<p>For a $20 donation you will receive a signed copy of my book. For a $50 donation you will not only receive a signed copy, but also a chance to mingle with my family and friends as we celebrate a new chapter in my life. For $100 you will be invited to also break bread (have dinner) with me and my closest friends to celebrate this new day. For a $250 donation, you will receive the book, cocktail party, dinner and a ""Thank you for helping to fund this project"" inside the book that will forever be a reminder that I could not have done this alone, and that someone is always there to have your back. </p>
<p>Most of the funds will go toward the editing, formatting and printing. My book cover is complete. If I don't reach my goal, I will not give up. I will move forward with my book. However, for those who would like to share this journey with me, donating for a book will go a long way. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It is time for me to give back. It is time to show the world that I have changed. I know I have it in me, and I know I can make a difference for others by sharing my journey. I have learned to accept others for who they are, the mistakes I've made  and to accept who I am. I have learned to appreciate the blessings that I failed to realize in the past. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are always risks associated with anything. I would be a fool to say there is none with this project. There is never a guarantee when it comes to anything we attempt in life. But I am determined to make my book, my future a success. I will publish this book, even if I have to wait a little long to make it happen on my own. I will not be discouraged. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand if you cannot financial help fund my project. All I ask is that you share it with those that are not burdened with financial obstacles. Please ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about my campaign. I want to show the world I can make a difference in the lives of others.</p>

Ultimately, I want you to see <i>Stirring the Pot</i> as a tool to help you unearth your own purpose and live it everyday.<br/><br/>In <i>Stirring the Pot</i>, you'll learn about women who are killing it in their personal and professional lives.

<li>My interview with Oprah who talks about what she’s doing that most of us are not. </li>
<li>An entrepreneur who made hooch in her bedroom at 12 years old and is now reaching for new heights that may include billionaire status. </li>
<li>A woman who took years to figure out that she is enough.</li>
<li>And, my personal stories of struggles and triumphs. </li>
</ul>You will love <i>Stirring the Pot</i> if you’re trying to find meaning in your life, if you want to uncover your own gifts and if you love a good story of women succeeding.<br/><br/><i>Stirring the Pot</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to women of all ages who want to wake up from their daily grind, get unstuck and find joy and meaning in their lives.<br/><br/> <h3><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></h3>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<p>The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in August 2021.</p>

<p>And much more!</p> <h3><strong>About the Author</strong></h3>
<p>Smart, persistent, and always enthusiastic, Traci excels at efficiently examining and assessing situations, utilizing creative ways to tackle seemingly impossible tasks. She’s not afraid to stir the pot if she knows something good is cooking on the other side. Helping women unearth their gifts is a genuine source of joy for her which is why she wrote <i>Stirring the Pot</i>. She hopes the words and wisdom spoken in the book will inspire women around the world in believing the impossible is possible and spark a fire in pursuing their passions and purpose. </p>
<p>With her background as an Emmy award-winning journalist, Traci prides herself on being an eloquent communicator, and a strategic thinker. She loves hearing a good story.  Over the years, she has heard some of the deepest secrets and the most incredible successes. </p>
<p>Traci has endless energy and positivity.  She also has a deep appreciation and love for her southern roots in New Orleans where she believes good people and good food go hand in hand. </p>
<p>Traci sincerely values time spent with her husband and children, which is why she often volunteers for events and activities at her children’s school. Her altruism doesn't end with her own family, as her efforts extend to a membership with the Junior League of Washington—a local organization that focuses on funding resources for complex literacy issues for all age groups. </p>
<p>Since she was a young child learning to read, Traci's imagination has always run wild when she curls up with a good book. When she wants to quiet the noise, she pulls out her sewing machine and morphs into her creative maker side.</p>

I wrote this book because I felt unseen and misunderstood after my brain injuries. I’m hoping my story can help others feel validated and show the possibility of resiliency.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the truth behind living with a brain injury and the difficult process of recovery. I want you to see this book as inspiration and an opportunity to overcome hardship, escape from personal lock down, and learn alongside me about the importance of healing, in your own way. <br/><br/>In this book, you will encounter multifaceted dimensions of identity and adventure through narratives like:</p><ul>
<li>How my concussions severely impacted my well-being — challenging how I defined myself when I could no longer work, go to school, exercise, or even communicate in the same way; </li>
<li>How subtle impacts and slip ups, caused by my brain injuries, severely impacted my decision making skills leading me question my ability to live independently;</li>
<li>Overcoming the natural challenges faced hiking through the Southern Alps, including river crossings, cyclones, and uncontrollable diarrhea, as well as the incredible moments of silence in the mountains, filtering through the light of the rising sun. </li>
</ul><p><br/>You will love this book if you are passionate about mental health, feel a connection with nature, and like a good adventure. <br/><br/><i>I Need a Walk </i>speaks to people coming of age and survivors who want to grapple with finding themselves and healing from trauma in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that I Need a Walk inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p><ul>

</h3><p><br/>The book is written in four parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> <i>Reward</i>  to <i>Resting</i>. As a young adult, I’m just trying to find my place in the world. I discuss how my life began to unravel as I tried to navigate a concussion. I was forced to realize how serious the injury was and start making adjustments in my life. <br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> <i>Finding the Sun</i> to <i>Entering the New</i>. One concussion turned out to be three separate concussions, leading to a traumatic brain injury diagnosis and long lasting impacts. I took my recovery seriously, going through therapy and continuing on with life, learning the value of a supportive community and advocating for myself. <br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> <i>The Beginning</i> to <i>Hike Your Own Hike</i>. I found a way to continue my recovery by backpacking over 800 miles, the length of the South Island of New Zealand, with a dear friend. I continued to struggle with my head, but found the space to really start healing. As I climbed mountains, experienced trail magic and unexpected challenges, I regained my sense of identity and confidence, realizing the unstoppable power of a human being. <br/><br/><strong>Part 4</strong> is an afterword, glancing into my life after the walk and how I’ve continued to heal, thrive, and find my own way. </p><p> </p><h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p> Tanner Roan is a community leader from St. Petersburg, FL. He is the founder of Ecstatic Dance St. Pete and works as a freelance writer and designer. He is incredibly passionate about self-work and aspires to be the best person he can be. He has presented transformative workshops across the country and is currently working to help improve the lives of others through writing. </p>
<p>Growing up, Tanner was perhaps the last person you'd expect to be hosting a popular dance event or presenting workshops on self-development. He was reserved, quiet, and suffered from bouts of severe depression, social anxiety, and suicidal ideation. He was reclusive and anti-social, and up until about 20 years old, severely overweight. </p>
<p>As a young adult, Tanner began his journey of self-development. He dropped his excess weight, began researching into psychology, spirituality, philosophy, and began experimenting with yoga and psychedelics to gain a deeper insight into the nature of reality and into himself.</p>
<p>Over the years, Tanner has been exploring different ways to improve himself, first to be able to function as a ""normal"" adult and then to improve himself to be able to better spread seeds of transformation to those who would benefit.</p>
<p>Today, Tanner employs many practices in order to function at his best including dance, writing, yoga, meditation, and more - all modalities exploring flow states. His goal is to reach as many people as possible who would benefit from his experience and story. </p>
<p>Here's a quote from Tanner:</p>
<p>""In my adolescence, I always felt like an outcast. I went without a true feeling of belonging until my early twenties when I finally began connecting with my self and with my tribes - when I finally built up enough courage to form my own sense of identity. In my work and my writing, it is my prime purpose to lend to my readers the agency to form their own identity, to live genuinely, and find what it truly means to be happy - to be who they are and love it.""</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>About the Letters</h3>
<p>I began “letters to my self” as a daily writing practice to bring attention to self-talk; as well as, the importance and impact of positive self-talk.</p>
<p>We all have a problem at times with being too hard on ourselves. If we were to talk to other people the way we often talk to ourselves, those people may never speak to us again. We should treat ourselves the way we treat those we love and avoid perpetuating negativity within us which only serves to take away from our happiness. If anything, this is a project about self-love. It’s about loving your self.</p>
<p>As you begin to improve your self-talk, you frame your experience with positivity. You can begin to see obstacles not as challenges to overcome, but opportunities for growth. You learn to build yourself up rather than putting yourself down. You stop beating yourself up for little things and start encouraging yourself to do bigger and better things.</p>
<p>Through these letters, I show how I talk with myself and share the messages I need to hear. I play with notions of self to express the balance between perceptions of self, between ego and soul, between self and other. I aim to blur the boundary lines between these to release an underlying message of love and oneness. That in writing to myself, I am also writing to you.</p>
<p>These letters are all raw, unedited, messages of positivity between my selves. They are spiritual in nature, as I take the time to allow connection with my intuition, with my unconscious, higher self, in order to express the truth I see. I write them to remind myself of beauty and love. I write them to keep myself on track and doing what matters. I write them so that I remember who I am and why I do what I do. I write them for myself, but just as much, I write them for you.</p>
<p>I hope that through these letters, you may look at and improve your own self-talk. I hope you take the time to connect with yourself and realize just how miraculous you really are, what you’re capable of. I hope you realize how much I love you.</p>
<p>The world can often seem a divided place. People can seem hateful and mean. But these expressions we see are reflections of internal states. People are mean because they’re mean to themselves, because they haven’t been shown another way. The world is becoming ever more loving and open, and it begins with you. With the way you talk to your self.</p>
<p>Love your self.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Publishing </h3>
<p>I want to get these letters out to whomever could benefit from them, in front of whomever will appreciate them. To do that, I would like to order an initial run of 100 art-style books, which will cost roughly $1200 - or 500 for roughly $3600, depending on how much we can raise. There will be additional costs for professional image editing and marketing , but I am only asking for help with the initial publishing costs.</p>

<h3>How you can help</h3>
<p>The most straight forward way is by making a donation to the campaign and preorder a book. Otherwise, simply sharing the campaign and sending it out to your friends would also help out immensley.</p>

To do that, I would like to order an initial run of 100 art-style books, which will cost roughly $1200 - or 500 for roughly $3600, depending on how much we can raise. There will be additional costs for professional image editing and marketing , but I am only asking for help with the initial publishing costs.

How you can help
The most straight forward way is by making a donation to the campaign and preorder a book. Otherwise, simply sharing the campaign and sending it out to your friends would also help out immensley.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

It tells the stories of people who I greatly admire as they find and remember their own happiness despite harsh circumstances in life. <br/><br/>My name is Elizabeth Lucy Ivanecky, and I am the author of <i>The Child in Us</i>. I wrote this book because I want more people, especially young people, to have the opportunity to reflect on their happiness and what happiness means to them. I want to show that even though we may not have our paths fully figured out in life that we are not any less valuable than those who do. Wouldn’t it be great if today’s youth could create more opportunities to understand each other, and our individual paths, without casting judgment? And even better, if young people could learn early on the importance that happiness plays throughout the rest of their life! It would certainly save them so much time and energy in the long run.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover what happiness means to you. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to remember your inner child and keep that child alive within you. </p><h2>About My Book</h2><p>In this book, you'll encounter multifaceted dimensions of happiness and unhappiness, acceptance and judgment, and innocence and experience through narratives like:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Haley Newlin</strong>, who has come such a long way from her days as a writing intern at several magazines, to writing her second novel, “Take Your Turn, Teddy.” Through her main character, she shared her struggles with depression and anxiety in her first horror novel “Not Another Sarah Halls” as a way to help her readers overcome their own struggles and fears. It was also incredible to hear about the wonderful people who support her in life like her twin sister, Hanna, and boyfriend, Jeremy.</li>
<li>
<strong>Tanveer Kalo</strong>, whose joy comes from learning and writing about the relatively untold history of his American-Indian community in the U.S. His passion for these stories sprouted from his own family tree which continue to grow the more he learns about his ancestors, their struggles, their joys, and their quest for the American Dream.</li>
</ul><h2>Audience</h2><p>You will love this book if you are interested in reflecting on, understanding, and remembering your own happiness. As you read these stories of other people’s happiness, I challenge you to take ownership over your own journey and story and reflect on who you are as a person. If you’re not where you want to be in life, you are never too young or old to make a positive change.<br/><br/><i>The Child in Us</i> speaks to people of all ages who are interested in staying connected to their inner child while finding and remembering their happiness. It is an especially important message for young people to learn sooner, rather than later in life.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>The Child in Us</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p><ul>
<li>What does happiness mean to you?</li>
<li>How do you keep your inner child alive while at the same time being a responsible, passionate adult?</li>
<li>How can I be happy even if I don’t have the things that I want yet in life?</li>
</ul><p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing happiness, our inner child, and our journeys as a work of art, will change us all for the better. </p><h2>The Book - The Child in Us</h2><p>The book is written in 3 Parts:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Part 1</strong> contains my <strong>author’s note</strong>, <strong>introduction</strong> and <strong>Chapters 1-5</strong>.

They are still early on in their journeys and are still in the process of understanding their own happiness.</li>
<li>
<strong>Part 2</strong> contains <strong>Chapters 6-10</strong>. Here you’ll meet people who have reflected more on their happiness and are actively pursuing their happiness.</li>
<li>
<strong>Part 3</strong> contains <strong>Chapters 11-13</strong> and the <strong>conclusion</strong>. Here you’ll meet people who are living out their happiness and looking back in time and remembering their journey — both the difficult times and the good times. I’ll also share what I’ve learned in the process of writing this book while having the opportunity to reflect on my own happiness.</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Rector Girls tells the story of an extraordinary woman who dedicated her life to serving others and the impact her legacy had on her daughter. The death of Grace’s mother took a toll on her life and fueled Grace’s journey to discover how to carry on her mom’s legacy. <br/><br/>My name is Grace Mariana Rector and I am the author of The Rector Girls. I wrote this book because I wanted to share the spectacular lessons on family, honesty, generosity, independence, and more that my mom taught me throughout her life. The wisdom she carried inspired everyone around her, and I want to pass that wisdom along so her memory never dies.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the intimate bond between my single mom and I, and learn what family means along the way. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement I have for storytelling, traveling, loving friends and family, and even talking with strangers. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you realize that you cannot control life, but you can control how you react to its ups and downs. My mom faced limitless setbacks, but she always remained calm, only changing what she could control.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the importance of traveling and never taking life too seriously. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>When my mom was in the hospital, I came to visit her. But rather than be sad and apologetic that her health had failed her, she and I decided to have fun, so I went shopping and made a nice picnic on the hospital side table! After eating our fun array of meats and cheeses, I crawled into her hospital bed and we watched a romantic comedy.</li>
<li>The time I got stuck on the Bolivian-Chilean border and had to hitchhike 7 hours in a 16-wheeler cargo truck.</li>
<li>My entire family, except my mom, is an adopted family, because my mom handpicked her tribe and invested in those relationships so I’d have a support network, even after she left me.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you care about untraditional families if you love hearing about travel adventures, and if you’re a romantic, just like me. The Rector Girls is a creative nonfiction book that speaks to young women exploring their journey forward and to adults reflecting on how they want to be remembered. </p>

<p><strong>Story of My Book</strong></p>
<p><i>The Nature of Work In The 21st Century…thinking of organizations as organisms</i> is about a new solution to a very human problem — how do we collaborate more effectively to achieve shared goals? My name is Greg Morris and I am the author of <i>The Nature of Work In The 21st Century</i>. I wrote this book because organizations and individuals are in dire need of an ability to adapt more quickly to change. We need new approaches to tackle the unprecedented extent of technology and pandemic driven change that we’re facing. Just working harder is not sustainable.<br/><br/>My book frames a new way of thinking about <i>work</i>, meaning efforts to achieve goals. This perspective enables a shared understanding of the work required to achieve goals. As a result, we can be more aligned, productive, and more likely to achieve goals effectively by simply thinking differently.<br/><br/>I will share how my work in medicine, health care, and consulting have defined the perspectives painted throughout the book. For example, the approach to enhancing problem-solving and value creation in business is modeled after how physicians learn to diagnose problems in the human body. I hope reading this book will instill in you the passion and excitement that I have for exploring the world by thinking differently.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you enjoy exploring different points of view,  you need to be a more effective problem solver, or you are just looking for something different to read on a quiet weekend. <br/><br/>The <i>Nature of Work In The 21st Century</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to business leaders and individual agents who want to lead, work in, and collaborate with organizations focused on creating value in the 21st-century economy. This book also offers a framework for students to understand leadership, management, and execution in a new way. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you be your best self — as an individual with big goals, as a team, or as a whole organization.<br/><br/><strong>The Book - The Nature Of Work In The 21st Century</strong></p>
<p>My book is written in three parts.</p>
<p>Part I: Work and organizations are human…<br/>In Chapters 1-2, I offer a perspective that presents work and organizations as intrinsic elements of human existence. My goal is to help you see past all the complexity and see work and organizations as manifestations of our humanity. For example, for as long as we have been human, we have “worked” to meet our needs and have “organized” to do that work. Here we are, many thousands of years later, still organizing to do work to meet our needs. <br/><br/>PART II: Work has changed...the system, not so much… <br/>In Chapters 3-5, we will bring into focus the paradigm — Frederick Taylor’s Scientific Management — that defines how we work in organizations. Our focus on efficiency, adherence to hierarchy, and predilection for bureaucracy are derivatives of this 100+ years old way of doing business. We will explore how the current system was designed with efficiency in mind, but how now, with the evolution of our economy, it undermines the effectiveness of knowledge work and problem-solving. We will consider this dilemma from an organizational perspective and from a knowledge worker point of view. We also will consider the role of ambiguity in suppressing productivity.<br/><br/>PART III: A choice to think differently (about the system)…<br/>In Chapters 6-9, we will stop to consider how every major advancement in human history is rooted in people embracing a new way of thinking. One example is that, at one time, we believed that the earth was at the center of the universe. Advances in communications and space travel would not have been possible without continuously relearning and redefining the way that we think. We will consider how frameworks play a critical role in disseminating and creating shared knowledge. I will introduce a framework for understanding how we can collaborate to achieve goals more effectively. Finally, we will look toward a better understanding of major trends or headwinds that we face. We will explore how we can use this framework to create greater value as we move further into the 21st century.<br/><br/><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></p>

<h3>Who is Heather?</h3>
<p>As a teen girl Heather was bullied and excluded by her peers. But instead of being crushed by those experiences, she found herself surrounded by big sisters in the faith who walked with her and helped her overcome those challenges. Now Heather is passionate about helping young women overcome their struggles and live their God-given dreams. She does this through motivational speaking, book writing and life coaching.</p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1547238202/ehpti0c50pdbrhdelpiu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>""Letters from a Big Sister: Shared wisdom to Encourage and Equip Teen Girls"" is a book birthed out of a dream to connect big sisters in the faith with their little sisters. Each chapter begins with a letter written from a big sister sharing a struggle she went through as a teenager and the truth she wishes she would have known then that could have helped her through. Our hope is that these stories will remind teen girls that they are not alone and there are other women who believe in them and are cheering them on. </p>
<p>Our Big Sisters are: Jess Connolly, Jamie Ivey, Kristene DiMarco, Jenna Kutcher, Jessica Honneger, Tiffany Thurston, Rach Kincaid, Leslie Crandall, Carrie Lloyd, Lauren Vallotton, Summer Wright, Hannah Giddens, Alisha Mckay and Shezza Ansloos. (read more about them under ""Contributors"")</p>
<p>When you contribute to this project you are becoming a big sister or big brother to these little sisters. You are saying to the teen girls in your life, whether daughters, grand daughters, sisters, nieces or cousins, that you believe in them and want them to live their best lives.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>We are hoping to raise $20,000 to cover the cost of design, editing, publishing and printing the first run of 1000 books. Heather has been working on this book since January 2017 and has personally invested about $10,000 into the project so far (design, editing and some of the publishing costs). To print the first 1000 copies will cost just over $10,000 so that is what we are hoping to raise with this campaign. </p>
<p>When you contribute to this campaign you get discount pricing on the book, fun perks (bonus chapter, free ebook, digital prints and more), plus access to our exclusive ""SISTER"" sweatshirts at wholesale pricing.</p>
<p>All money raised will go towards printing the first 1000 copies of the book, whether our goal is met or not. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>""Letters"" is unlike any book on the market right now for teen girls. Not only is it a full colour book with beautiful images and design, it is full of raw and vulnerable stories addressing the issues teen girls face, but rarely feel safe to talk about. The book covers topics like anxiety, body image, sexuality, family challenges, dating, and more from a biblical perspective. At the end of each chapter is a section set aside for different reflection activities such as bullet journal pages, scriptures for further study, action steps and song suggestions. </p>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Some of the challenges with this book will be getting the word out beyond Heather's personal platform. Because we are publishing with a small Canadian publishing house rather than a larger American publisher, we'll definitely need your help in spreading the word! </p>
<p>By having each of our 14 contributors share on their platforms we will be able to get the word out beyond where any one of us could on our own. And with your help there's no telling how far this message will spread!</p>
<p>We also plan to do radio and TV interviews, contact church youth groups to buy books for small group studies or grad gifts, advertise on social media and more. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know that not everyone will be able to contribute financially to this project but another powerful way to help is by sharing this campaign with your circle of friends. Posting about it on facebook or instagram, or telling your church youth pastor will make a huge difference in getting the word out! </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>The Changing Face of Power explores the power, influence, and visibility of the new generation of Latinx leaders in the United States while deconstructing what Latinx Excellence really means, who it’s for, and how the contributions of Millennial and Generation Z Latinx leaders are profoundly impacting the trajectory of the United States.</i><br/><br/>My name is Claudia Alarco Alarco and I am the author of <i>The Changing Face of Power</i>. I wrote this book because Millennial and Generation Z Latinxs in the United States are fundamentally transforming this nation and they’re doing so in ways that are more disruptive, innovative, and inclusive than ever before.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover and realize the limitless power and potential of Millennial and Gen Z Latinx leaders, while also learning about the ways in which this new generation of Latinx leaders are leading the fight for a more inclusive redefinition of what it means to be Latinx in the United States.</p>
<p>In this book, I hope to instill the same passion and excitement that I have for the deconstruction of Latinx Excellence in <i>you</i>. I want you to see this book as a tool to help you better understand how Latinx Excellence has perpetuated white supremacy and the deeply rooted anti-blackness within the Latinx community and how we can begin to dismantle this and redefine Latinx Power.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you are passionate about the power that the new generation of Latinx leaders hold in this country, if you are committed to uplifting and elevating all Latinx voices and if you are invested in seeing a progressive and inclusive change in this community and in the United States at large.<br/><br/><i>The Changing Face of Power </i>is a non-fiction book that speaks to those in the Latinx community who are aware and cognizant of the systems of power that intentionally oppress those who are not proximate to whiteness and those who are looking to deconstruct, dismantle, and redefine. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
The Changing Face of Power explores the power, influence, and visibility of the new generation of Latinx leaders in the United States while deconstructing what Latinx Excellence really means, who it’s for, and how the contributions of Millennial and Generation Z Latinx leaders are profoundly impacting the trajectory of the United States.My name is Claudia Alarco Alarco and I am the author of The Changing Face of Power. I wrote this book because Millennial and Generation Z Latinxs in the United States are fundamentally transforming this nation and they’re doing so in ways that are more disruptive, innovative, and inclusive than ever before.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover and realize the limitless power and potential of Millennial and Gen Z Latinx leaders, while also learning about the ways in which this new generation of Latinx leaders are leading the fight for a more inclusive redefinition of what it means to be Latinx in the United States.
In this book, I hope to instill the same passion and excitement that I have for the deconstruction of Latinx Excellence in you. I want you to see this book as a tool to help you better understand how Latinx Excellence has perpetuated white supremacy and the deeply rooted anti-blackness within the Latinx community and how we can begin to dismantle this and redefine Latinx Power.You will love this book if you are passionate about the power that the new generation of Latinx leaders hold in this country, if you are committed to uplifting and elevating all Latinx voices and if you are invested in seeing a progressive and inclusive change in this community and in the United States at large.The Changing Face of Power is a non-fiction book that speaks to those in the Latinx community who are aware and cognizant of the systems of power that intentionally oppress those who are not proximate to whiteness and those who are looking to deconstruct, dismantle, and redefine.

</h2><p><i>Missing Pieces</i> is a true story about childhood sexual abuse, the effects of leaving trauma unhealed, and finding the courage to fight for your life.<br/><br/>At ten years old, I realized that I was different. The way I interacted with others, or lack there of, was a struggle. At twenty-five, I found out why. I wanted to forget it, and I did... Or so I thought.<br/><br/>My name is Andi Hunt and I am the author of <i>Missing Pieces</i>. I wrote this book because I believe part of my journey in this lifetime is to help encourage others, like me, to persevere to get the help they need to feel whole again. This book actually became part of my pathway to finding peace, one paragraph at a time.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover your ability to achieve healing, recovery, and peace. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to openly talk about sexual abuse, childhood abuse, trauma, PTSD, panic, anxiety, depression, suicide, and addiction. Use my story to open up a conversation with a friend or a family member who may need the encouragement to seek help. Something that I’m grateful to have finally managed, at forty-four years of age.<br/><br/>One reason I wrote this book is that I wanted to understand why I suffered for thirty-one years with depression, anxiety, and fear. The day I realized that no pill would fix me, and I couldn’t leave my house without having a panic attack, I decided that was enough. I was going to take my life back no matter what it took. I asked a friend for a referral to their therapist and made an appointment. That was the day I met my monster, face to face.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you love stories of victory and overcoming the odds, enjoy learning about other people’s journeys and the obstacles they faced and succeeded against. You will find yourself eager to learn how you can help encourage others to do their part to change the view of mental health in todays world.<br/><br/><i>Missing Pieces</i> speaks to adults and teenagers who want to learn about mental health and how to achieve a peaceful state with the right counseling and daily practices.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Missing Pieces</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p><ul>
<li>Why am I never enough?</li>
<li>Why do I have to hide this thing that happened to me or how I feel?</li>

Fall 2021</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Why I wrote <i>Out To Lead</i></strong></h3><p>My name is Jonathan Dromgoole and I am the author of Out to Lead. My book is about resilience and leadership within the LGBTQ+ community, and the reasons why we are currently seeing a rise in LGBTQ+ leaders in all industries. <br/><br/>LGBTQ+ people have always existed and played an influential role in society. So influential in fact that society wrote laws to exclude the community for centuries. I wrote this book because the LGBTQ+ community’s history needs to be shared. For so long our stories have often told and portrayed through the lens of someone else - someone who is usually straight - and it's important that we get to share our own stories. <br/><br/>In reading this book, you will discover how LGBTQ+ leaders have overcome adversity throughout their lives to become the resilient and effective leaders we have begun to see. My hope for this book is that it will inspire future leaders, motivate allies to hire and support Queer individuals, and break down barriers with those who need to realize the value of people that identify as LGBTQ+. </p><p> </p><h3><strong><i>Out to Lead</i></strong></h3><p>The book is written in three parts...<br/><br/>Part 1 looks at the rise of queer rights and resilience focusing on the lack of LGBTQ+ history and what our community looked like before the concept of “pride.” It also looks at the first out LGBTQ+ elected official in the United States – no it wasn’t Harvey Milk. <br/><br/>Part 2 looks deeper into the creation of queer resilience through personal stories and those from cultural, business, and political LGBTQ+ leaders. <br/><br/>Part 3 focuses on the value of coming out and using your authentic voice. It also takes a step back to look at the diversity within the LGBTQ+ community and what comes next.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></h3><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

Then suddenly sitting there on those steps I looked out into the street full of people walking in and out of stores, out of the metro, simply going about their day-to-day without a care in the world and then I realized. I was lost, alone, and confused. The tremendous blow shook the world around me like one does a cheap souvenir snow glob you play with, but don't buy, at the airport gift shop just to pass the time between flights. I just sat there, numb, letting it all swirl and clash around me. Letting the rush of emotions enter and consume me in only the way a life-changing moment can. I couldn’t deny it anymore this was it, this was me, it had always been me and it was time to let him out."" - Out To Lead. Fall 2021 Why I wrote Out To LeadMy name is Jonathan Dromgoole and I am the author of Out to Lead. My book is about resilience and leadership within the LGBTQ+ community, and the reasons why we are currently seeing a rise in LGBTQ+ leaders in all industries. LGBTQ+ people have always existed and played an influential role in society. So influential in fact that society wrote laws to exclude the community for centuries. I wrote this book because the LGBTQ+ community’s history needs to be shared. For so long our stories have often told and portrayed through the lens of someone else - someone who is usually straight - and it's important that we get to share our own stories. In reading this book, you will discover how LGBTQ+ leaders have overcome adversity throughout their lives to become the resilient and effective leaders we have begun to see. My hope for this book is that it will inspire future leaders, motivate allies to hire and support Queer individuals, and break down barriers with those who need to realize the value of people that identify as LGBTQ+.  Out to LeadThe book is written in three parts...Part 1 looks at the rise of queer rights and resilience focusing on the lack of LGBTQ+ history and what our community looked like before the concept of “pride.” It also looks at the first out LGBTQ+ elected official in the United States – no it wasn’t Harvey Milk. Part 2 looks deeper into the creation of queer resilience through personal stories and those from cultural, business, and political LGBTQ+ leaders. Part 3 focuses on the value of coming out and using your authentic voice. It also takes a step back to look at the diversity within the LGBTQ+ community and what comes next. What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press.

<h2>The Golden Thread: Where to Find Purpose in the Stages of Your Life</h2>
<p>The book is a storied expose on how Purpose lives within us, and right in front of us. I wrote it because it is time for us all to contribute our Golden Thread to the tapestry of humanity. My book will publish in April, 2020.</p>
<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p>This book will dispel any notion that your life doesn’t matter. I’ll show you how your own nuanced one-of-a-kind Purpose is right there in front of you, waiting to be discovered, so you can listen to its whispers and let it guide you like a GPS to a more fulfilling and impactful life.  I'll also show how your nuanced Purpose shows up uniquely at different stages of life (related to Stage of Consciousness), which is part of why we can't see our Purpose so clearly.<br/><br/>Most people think or believe that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purpose is a job or career, or a passion, and that you usually figure it out as an adult, if at all.</li>
<li>Childhood wounding is bad, and prevents you from living a good life. </li>
<li>We are “defined” at an early age, which becomes the identity our lives get stuck in.</li>
</ul>
<p>BUT, based on my 30-plus years of research and in activating thousands of clients to “find themselves,” and then to live powerful, aligned lives guided by their deep Soul Purpose, I’ve come to witness that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purpose is the seed that guides us throughout our life.</li>
<li>Passions and curiosities are indicators of Purpose, and jobs and careers are expressions of Purpose, but they are not inherently our Purpose.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>In this book, I’ll demonstrate how Purpose shows up in different parts of our lives through our unique expression.</p>
<p>Our childhood wounding is an indicator of Purpose, which we can use to uncover our Purpose as we explore and heal that wound. In this book, I’ll show why we’re required to do this “growing up”, and accomplish the developmental tasks at different stages of life, in order to fully express our Purpose.</p>
<p>Our Soul Purpose is evident at very early stages in life, as our soul pulls us in the direction of our longings. In this book, I’ll demonstrate how we sabotage that pull and limit our own evolution and purposeful expression. </p>
<p>I’m Holly Woods, and I am the author of The Golden Thread. I was compelled to write this book after uncovering these patterns that debunked the myths about Purpose. <br/><br/>Most people don’t think to “find themselves” until serious turmoil or trauma forces them to explore who they are, or later in life, as they experience a deep longing for more meaning. I wondered if it didn’t have to be that hard or come so late in life. So I put on my scientist hat and found a childhood pattern of extremely nuanced soul expression that was repeated over and over, like a “thread” throughout our lives. <br/><br/>This Golden Thread is evident very early, and somehow we miss it.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you’ll discover where to look for the Golden Thread in your life stories. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same passion and excitement that I have for living my Purpose. And then ultimately, I want you to use this book as a tool to help you watch for and create a different trajectory for a life with more meaning, intention, and success.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about how the GPS of your Purpose pulls you forward, and how it shows up distinctly over your life span. You’ll meet numerous former clients, a handful of colleagues and Purpose mentors and hear about the Golden Threads that run through their lives. These include:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Gregg Levoy, Author, former reporter and behavioral specialist at USA Today, whose explorations of the secret passageways of his grandfather’s house led him to have courage to step into the dark crevasses of his psyche to find his calling;</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Tim Kelley, Author and Founder of the True Purpose Institute, whose childhood experiences caused him to have a loss of faith but ultimately led to his work to resolve intractable social problems around the globe; </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Agathe Daae-Qvale, a former tech consultant in Norway turned serial entrepreneur whose childhood desire to include strangers turned into several start-ups to aid the integration of immigrants into European countries;</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">And many other stories highlighting the early nuanced expression of Purpose and how it shows up over a lifetime.</p>
<p>You will love this book if you are someone who has been searching for your own Purpose and wondering why you can’t find it. Or maybe you want to read stories and be inspired by people who’ve learned to successfully live into their Purpose so you can learn from them. <br/><br/>And especially if you want to contribute your greatest gifts in this time of crisis on the planet, this book is for you. <br/>.<br/>The Golden Thread is a non-fiction book that speaks to Visionaries who want to execute their ideas, veteran Professionals who want to find more meaning in their career, Seekers who want to embody their spirituality, and Parents who want to help their children find their Purpose earlier than they did. It’s for anybody who is looking at finding their Soul Purpose and creating a life aligned with that.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Golden Thread: Where to Find Purpose in the Stages of Your Life</h2>
<p><br/>The book is written in Three Parts.<br/><br/>Part One contains the Introduction and Chapters 1 and 2, and shows how Purpose shows up as the Golden Thread, guiding us forward. You’ll see how the thread has shown up in your life, and why you may have missed it. You’ll read about the science behind Purpose and how it can affect every area of your life, from health and well-being, job or career satisfaction, abundance and even organizational success.<br/><br/>Part Two contains Chapters 3-6. These Chapters go into detail about how Purpose shows up in different phases of life, starting with childhood through mature adult, using several frameworks to help you think about how Purpose may have shown up in those stages in your own life. You’ll see the Golden Threads of the book’s characters depicted across these stages.<br/><br/>Part Three contains Chapters 7-9. Here you’ll learn about what it means to live “on Purpose,” as the existence of living in flow and coming to know yourself newly, rather than the over-identified personality which creates most of the turmoil of our lives. We’ll discuss what the world needs now, and why living your own “why” matters most of all. You’ll get top-notch advice to start looking for your own Golden Thread so you can move into your Purpose adventure. <br/> </p>

</div></div>","La Spatula Clark, langue de cuisine  concept
La cuisine est un lieu du plaisir, de l'invention, du partage.

En revisitant la spatule de nos cuisines, la jeune designer Hélène Olive allie la technicité de cet incontournable ustensile au détournement poétique et drolatique qui en décale les habituelles caractéristiques.
La Spatula Clark arbore une insaisissable incongruité inventive : c'est une langue bleue et souple qui remue, mélange, tourne, étale, agite ou prélève au bout d'un manche tout aussi bleu et tendre.
L'objet est en silicone alimentaire. Sa souplesse et sa couleur inhabituelle en font une spatule unique dans la cuisine. Son nom rend un hommage teinté d'humour respectueux à la plus frenchie des chanteuses anglaises des années 70...



Spatula
Clark, tongue of cooking   conceptThe
kitchen is a place of pleasure, invention, sharing.
By
revisiting the spatula  of our kitchens, the young designer Hélène
Olive allies the technicality of this inescapable utensil to the
poetic and funny gap which moves its usual characteristics.Spatula Clark raises an imperceptible creative incongruity : it is a blue and soft tongue which stires, mixes, turns, spreads, shakes at the tip of a handle also blue and soft.



The
object is made with food silicone. Its flexibility and its unusual
color make a unique spatula  in the  kitchen. its name pays a tribute
tinged with respectful humor to the most frenchie of the 70s' english
singers...

La Spatula Clark, langue de cuisine    qui ?
Une nouvelle collaboration qui réunit Smoll, petites opportunités des créations contemporaines animé par Brigit Meunier Bosch et la jeune designer et designer sonore  toulousaine Hélène Olive
                                                                    
Les installations et les objets d'Hélène Olive donnent aux matières sonore et tactile un rôle essentiel et singulier qui métamorphose définitivement la relation avec notre environnement proche, le fonctionnel, les animaux, la nourriture. Ce ""design"" sensible, curieux, exigeant et non dépourvu d'humour est une invitation originale et multiple à la rencontre de ce que nous sommes avec les autres.    
                                                                                                                                          
L'engagement de longue date pour la création contemporaine et les artistes est le socle de l'aventure artistique personnelle et professionnelle sans cesse renouvelée de Brigit Meunier Bosch. Des collaborations multiples et enrichissantes qui se sont concrétisées entre autres dans l'édition de livres contemporains d'artistes, la direction du BBB centre d 'art à Toulouse ou de l'école supérieure d'art de Dunkerque... Elle crée Smoll en septembre 2012.

Spatula Clark, tongue of cooking  Who ?A new collaboration which gathers  Smoll, small opportunities of the contemporary creations managed by Brigit Meunier Bosch and the young designer and sound designer Hélène Olive



Installations,
objects and Hélène Olive's spaces give to the sound material an
essential and special role which definitively transforms our relation
with our close enviromnent, fonctionnal objects, animals or food.
This sensitive, curious, exigent ""design"", not lacking in
humour, is an original and multiple invitation to the meeting of what
we are with others. 



The
long-time commitment for contemporary creation and artists is the
base of Brigit Meunier Bosch's personal and professional artistic
adventure. Multiple and enriching collaborations which became a
reality among others in the edition(publishing) of contemporary
artist's books, the management of the BBB, art center to Toulouse or
the Art school of Dunkirk... She creates Smoll in September, 2012

Smoll est une toute petite entreprise en train de pousser qui prend ses repères en couveuse entrepreneuriale. Juste un bureau/atelier pas très loin de Toulouse. Pour le reste de l'énergie, des idées, des projets, des complicités, un site, des hôtes...
Avec le livre de cuisine radiophonique, édité en 10 exemplaires au printemps dernier par Smoll avec Hélène Olive, une rigoureuse boîte blanche cachait de savoureuses et baroques recettes narrées avec drôlerie par l'étonnante mamie de la designer.


Avec la Spatula Clark, c'est une nouvelle invitation à expérimenter votre cuisine ...

 Alors oui nous avons besoin de vous !
Parce que nous croyons que la poésie et la fantaisie riment avec création et innovation  et peuvent trouver naturellement leur place dans une cuisine. 
Parce que nous soutenons l'idée que la création est à vivre avec intensité au quotidien. Un certain Robert Filliou l'a exprimé bien mieux que nous (""l'art, c'est ce qui rend la vie plus intéressante que l'art..."")

Then
yes we need you!
Because
we believe that the poetry and the whim are rhyming with creation and
innovation and can find naturally their place in a kitchen.

day. Robert Filliou expressed it much better than we ("" Art, it's what makes life more interesting than art "")

</div><h3>¿Qué?</h3><b>El Rey Bufón</b> es una novela que asienta su argumento sobre una base histórica, sin renunciar por ello a un ritmo trepidante y unas tramas llenas de diversión.<br/><blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Aseguran
las crónicas que el mítico rey de Tartessos, Arganthonio, vivió más allá de los
120 años de edad, y que esto fue posible tras robar una manzana a las
Hespérides de su jardín al igual que hiciera el mismísimo Hércules en uno de
sus doce trabajos. Pero los años pasaron y aquel rey poderoso se convirtió, a
cambio de su longevidad, en un anciano decrépito. </p>
<p>El
don de la longevidadacarreaba, además, asumir
una maldición: Arganthonio sería el último rey de Tartessos y, a su muerte, el
reino desaparecería con él. Apremiados por esta vieja leyenda los druidas de
las diez tribus que conforman el reino deciden enviar a alguien para robar otra
manzana del jardín de las Hespérides que le permita a Arganthonio vivir cien
años más y, con ello, asegurar la pervivencia del reino. El elegido no es otro
que el deforme bufón del rey, que será acompañado en tan incierto viaje por un inexperto
druida.</p>
<p><span> El viaje hacia el jardín de las Hespérides les llevará más
allá de Gadir, enfrentándose a un imperio naciente, Cartago, que parece dispuesto
a engullir Tartessos y sus codiciadas minas de plata.</span></p>
