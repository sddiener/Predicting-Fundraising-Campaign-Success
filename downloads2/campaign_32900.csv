<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We are 5 students from a high school in North Charleston, South Carolina attempting to go on the trip of a lifetime to Costa Rica in June 2013. We are members of the National Honor Society of our school, which means we excel in leadership, character, scholarship, and service. Working hard throughout our years at school, has given us some hope that our hard work could be rewarded with an educational trip to Costa Rica. We have many aspirations in becoming a multitude of professions such as: an engineer, veterinarian, doctor, politician, and teacher, and we feel this trip could greatly benefit our goals. Most of us have barely been out of the state, let alone the country, and this presents us with an exciting opportunity. All the new experiences and cultural exposure while traveling through Costa Rica, will serve as life-long lessons for us as we grow and will undoubtedly change our perspective of ourselves and even our place in the world. While we have set our goals high, we can't do this without you. Many of us come from low income families and our collective goal of $10,000 seems unattainable. We have been struggling and working hard all year, but we still have a long way to go. We understand we have a lot of obstacles in our way, but we won't let our zip code, our family's income, nor any of the other hardships prevent us from reaching our goals. We forever thank you for reading about our story and donating to our cause. By donating you are improving our lives and our education. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why This Is Important To Us</h3>
<p>Educational travel is a key component of our new globally-focused curriculum. The opportunity to witness new cultures firsthand and experience history typically only learned in a textbook is one that only enhances a student’s enthusiasm for learning. By traveling to Costa Rica, we have an excellent opportunity to earn an elective credit toward our education. This credit will help us when we apply for college because colleges look for applicants who have international experience. More colleges and universities are making cultural awareness part of the curriculum, and no matter what their college prospects are, experiencing life abroad will give us an edge on college applications.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em><strong>""To see the exotic places, meet new people, and actually go somewhere new is thrilling to think about.

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em><strong>""I'm excited to see everything!

I want to be a vet, so seeing monkeys everywhere is going to be fascinating!""<br/></strong></em></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Trip</h3>
<p>We will be in Costa Rica for 9 days. During our trip to Costa Rica we will be able to visit important landmarks such as the Pas Volcano and hotsprings, zipline through the canopy in the Santa Elena Cloud Forest, visit a local school, and hike Manuel Antonio National Park to learn about a broad range of flora and fauna and how to protect the rainforest.</p>
<p><br/>Your generous donation will help one student make his or her dream come true. Your money will go towards:</p>
<div>Round-trip flights, transportation within Costa Rica, 8 overnight stays in hotels, 3 meals daily, full-time tour director, comprehensive sightseeing of natural attractions, and entrance to INBioparque • Poás Volcano • Hot springs • Lake Arenal kayaking • La Fortuna Waterfall • Santa Elena Cloud Forest • Canopy adventure • Carara Biological Reserve • Manuel Antonio National Park •  Whitewater rafting • horseback riding •  folklore evening with locals</div>

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>As a senior at The Ross School, I have a unique opportunity: I'll be spending my last year of high school focusing on a personal passion. Our “Senior Project” is something Ross students think about - and plan for - as soon as we start high school.</p>
<p>Cars have been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember. In fact, if you ask my parents, they’ll say I’ve been pointing at cars and trucks since before I could talk. As a kid, my room was filled with Matchbox and Hot Wheels, my shirts, sheets and walls were covered in cars and trucks, and I would only read books and watch videos with automotive themes. My first car was a battery operated Fisher Price Jeep that I drove endlessly around the backyard, navigating in and out of the orange cones that my folks had cheerfully put out for me.</p>
<p>As I got older, my tastes matured, but my passion remained. I started watching the British TV show “Top Gear,” going to the Auto Show at the Javits center every year, playing driving simulator games on my Playstation, and challenging myself to identify any car on the road, type and model, at a single glance.</p>
<p>During my freshman year of high school, I spent three weeks interning at <a href=""http://www.joesgarageinc.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Joe’s Garage</a> in Southampton, under the mentorship of Joe Frizell. That took my passion one step further, by allowing me to learn about the inside of a car as well as the outside. It was also the first time it occurred to me that I might, one day, restore a classic car of my own… maybe even for my Senior Project.</p>
<p>I started saving up - birthday and Christmas gifts, and later, paychecks - and over the course of the past four years, I finally accumulated the funds to purchase a fixer-upper. </p>
<p>This past June, after several months of dreaming and searching, I found the project car of my dreams: a <strong>1966 Mustang Coupe</strong>. </p>
<p>I'll be doing as much of the work myself as I can, and documenting every step on my blog, <a href=""http://www.mustangsam.net,"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.mustangsam.net,</a> as well as via a short Before-and-After film that will be part of my final presentation. In addition to the <strong>engineering, mechanics and design lessons</strong> I will be learning, I am experiminenting with <strong>entrepreneurship</strong> by <strong>building and following a budget, launching this IndieGogo fundraising campiagn,</strong> and continuing to develop strength in my other two passions: computers and film-making. </p>
<p>But I need help funding the restoration. Thank you for any and all support you can provide in realizing this long-held dream... (and strengthening my college transcript in the process!)</p>

The Silicon Valley Vision Center is a 14,000 square foot creative
arts and technology facility for the community in San Jose, California.
 
Creative Arts, Media Production, Computer Technology, and Health
Awareness community classes for under-served kids and youth.   WATCH OUR VIDEO



We believe that every child, and youth should have access to creative
arts programs, cutting-edge technology that will benefit their future.  We
want to encourage a healthy and wellness lifestyle, as well as, enjoying fun
foods!  

 The
Silicon Valley Vision Center after school program, is open to the community.
 We are putting together dynamic programs using industry leaders, in each
discipline, as instructors, from the Bay Area.  Our schools have struggled
to keep creative arts programs vibrant with school budget cuts.  As a
community, it is imperative that we shoulder some responsibility of keeping
dying programs alive and active in our community.  The Silicon Valley Vision Center's goal is to lead the community in this effort.         

We will have recitals,
     showcasing music and dance achievements. 
We will have art contests, and
     art gallery shows. 
We will work with school
     leaders and community officials, on how we can better serve them and the

<p>My name is Brandon
Peak. Originally from central Pennsylvania, I was led in the spring of 2013 to
pack up and move (along with my wife and two daughters) down south to sunny New
Port Richey, Florida. In short order, we bought a wonderful home, made great
friends, and started to settle in. </p>
<h2><b>A Problem</b></h2>
<p>It didn’t take long
for us to begin to notice just how radically different this area is from what we
were used to – housing wise. For instance, we saw nice, well kept, well-loved
homes right next to run down empty houses with busted windows and overgrown
lawns. <i>(Come to find that about
20% of all housing in the city is vacant) </i>Or one side of the street will be clean and
attractive while the other side is abandoned and dilapidated. The blight was so
widespread and didn’t seem to be limited to one area over another. No
neighborhood… no street… is exempt. The next thing I noticed was just how many
people rented their living space rather than owning. (<i>One third of all single family homes in the
city are renter occupied. This is about double the county average</i>) I wrongly assumed that it must be a “rent-because-it’s-cheaper”
climate. In fact it costs MORE to rent here than it does to have a mortgage on
a home. Rents are high and many landlords are less than reputable. The more I
talked with longtime residents, the more the real problem became clear. Many
people want to plant roots in New Port Richey, commit to buying a home, and
take some pride in caring for their property – but can’t. Why?</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Bad credit</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">No down payment savings</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Poor condition of homes in their price range</span><br/>
</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>It was quickly obvious
that this trend of housing, and the negative ripple effect it causes, was not
going to correct itself any time soon. Something new needed to be done.</p>
<h2><b>A Solution</b></h2>
<p>I was motivated to
really examine what I could bring to the table. What I could do. Steps I could
take. Since I work in the field of Architecture as a Project Manager, I was
able to draw on a pool of close friends in real estate, construction,
insurance, lending, and the like. Through those chats, these notions kept
coming back up:</p>
<blockquote><i>What if there was a way to purchase these
blighted properties, renovate, and connect them with people who are struggling
with the credit and down payment issues? What if there was a way to set up a
program for them to be able to move into the new house and for 12 months, build
an escrow account, build credit, and learn a bit of how to care for their
property? What if 100% of the profits from one project were put right back into
doing more projects? Helping more people? What impact would this make? </i></blockquote>

people want to plant roots in New Port Richey, commit to buying a home, and
take some pride in caring for their property – but can’t. Why?


Bad credit


No down payment savings


Poor condition of homes in their price range


It was quickly obvious
that this trend of housing, and the negative ripple effect it causes, was not
going to correct itself any time soon. Something new needed to be done.
A Solution
I was motivated to
really examine what I could bring to the table. What I could do. Steps I could
take. Since I work in the field of Architecture as a Project Manager, I was
able to draw on a pool of close friends in real estate, construction,
insurance, lending, and the like. Through those chats, these notions kept
coming back up:
What if there was a way to purchase these
blighted properties, renovate, and connect them with people who are struggling
with the credit and down payment issues? What if there was a way to set up a
program for them to be able to move into the new house and for 12 months, build
an escrow account, build credit, and learn a bit of how to care for their
property? What if 100% of the profits from one project were put right back into
doing more projects? Helping more people? What impact would this make? 
What impact would it
make? Blight would be transformed into beauty. Neighborhoods would be more
desirable. Surrounding property values would improve. Pride in home ownership
would be restored. Families could finally plant in the city – and save money on
living expenses. True equity would be built. And through it all, a sustainable
cycle of improving the city would be born.
317Development
So this is what we’re
setting out to do. I’m working to pool all of the resources, friends,
consultants, and contacts I have to do exactly what I just described. I’m
setting up 317Development to oversee and facilitate the vision:
“Developing high quality home ownership
opportunities for individuals and families with a focus on self-sufficiency,
neighborhood revitalization, and overall housing sustainability.”
I will be donating all
of my time to make this work. This is not an investment angle. This is a
natural desire to make a change around me – and a will to do whatever it takes
to succeed.
What We Need & What you get
This campaign has been
set up to help offset the costs of doing the first project. Your support will
go directly towards:

Fees to set up 317Development as a legal entity.
Purchase down payment and closing costs on a real New
     Port Richey property.
Deposits on renovation costs.
Please keep in mind,
that one of the best parts of this effort, is that from just this one project,
the seed gets planted to grow many future projects. Your donation will grow

<h3>Why This Is So Important</h3>
<p><br/></p> <p></p>
<p>When Gov. Neil Abercrombie signed Senate Bill 2545 in 2012, repealing 
the junior kindergarten program at the end of the 2013-14 school year, 
it created a pool of children who, unless conditions change, will fall 
through the cracks when it comes to early childhood education. </p>
“There is a shortage of preschools on the 
island. I’ve never seen it this bad,” said Val Rita, director of A Room 
to Grow school in Lihue.  “I know in Lihue and Kapaa, in particular, 
there are a lot of pre-schools with waiting lists. Now that the law has 
gone into effect, parents are getting desperate. I’m getting a lot of 
calls from parents of 4 year olds that don’t have any place for their 
children to go.”<p></p>
<p>That law, coupled with the age change requirements created by an earlier act compounded the problem. </p>
<p>Children who turn five years old on or after Aug.
 1 this year will need to wait until the 2015-16 school year to enroll 
in kindergarten. Prior to that bill being signed, children could enter 
public school if they were at least five years old on or before Dec. 
31. </p>
<p>The age requirements are forcing hundreds of parents to scramble for preschools where they can enroll their children.</p>

landscapes nature can offer, and we take advantage of it.  Youth in our community grow up skiing,
snowboarding, climbing, hiking, and all kinds of other activities that most can
only dream of doing.  But these
activities don’t make a complete childhood, and the arts are woefully
underrepresented in our community.  The
Bow Valley Music Festival is trying to change that. </p>
<p>I’m Noah
Borin, representing the Bow Valley Music Festival.  I have been teaching music for almost a
decade and have seen firsthand what this creative outlet can do for
children.  </p>
<p>For the
past 5 years, we have run on a budget designed to cover costs and continue
offering this festival to our community. 
Now we are at a crossroads.  It’s
time to grow in both size and scope and offer more, but we need your help to
make this growth happen.  The Bow Valley
Music Festival is unique in our area, and the service it provides our youth in
invaluable.  Thank you in advance for
your support.  </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>The Bow
Valley Music Festival is looking at growing in several key areas.  Your $2,500 in contributions will help us do
many things.  But first, we need to point
out a few things.  First, our board is
entirely volunteer-based and we have no staff members.  None of your contributions will go towards
wages or honorariums for the BVMF team. 
Second, we set our registration prices to be as low as possible in the
hopes that nobody is barred from entry because of money.  Our fees are set to cover the normal
operating costs of our festival (mostly hiring adjudicators and renting
space).  Your contributions will allow us
to both expand into our dream festival and keep our registration fees
down.  </p>
<p><b>Provincial Festival Plans</b></p><p>We have joined the Alberta Provincial Music
Festival Association (<a href=""http://www.albertamusicfestival.org/default.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://www.albertamusicfestival.org/default.aspx</span></a>).  As part of this group of festivals across
Alberta, we can send our best to Edmonton to compete in the Provincial Music
Festival in May.  The Youth in our
community finally have an artistic goal to strive for – to represent us in
Edmonton with the best-of-the-best from around the province. In Edmonton they
have a reason to strive to be better, the chance to meet other like-minded
students, be rewarded for their years of hard work, and the chance to make a
memory they’ll never forget.  These
things already exist in sports in our community, but now they can exist in the
arts too.  More, we dream of these kids
coming home and telling their friends how cool it was to travel and do music! </p>
<p>This doesn't come free.  Joining this group will cost us in terms of
membership dues.  If we raise enough
money here, we would love to offer financial aid to those students chosen to
travel.  </p>
<p>Additionally, joining requires us to adopt new organizational systems to meet provincial regulations.  This is exactly the kind of one-time cost
that your contributions here will help us make. 
</p>
<p><b>New Instruments, More Adjudicators</b></p><p>A Music Festival is only as good as its
adjudicators.  These charismatic,
talented, and knowledgeable people are the cornerstone of our festival.  A good adjudicator makes the difference
between not just a good and a bad experience, but a good and a great experience
for our participants. </p>
<p>The larger we get, the more adjudicators we
need.  We are looking to expand our class
offerings into vocals and winds, but this means more adjudicators and we may
not have enough entries in the first year to pay their fees.  We cannot afford to “cheap out” on this part
of the festival, and committing to extra instruments means committing to this
cost especially.  We pay competitive
rates with other music festivals, and it will be very difficult for us to take
this risk without your contributions here. 
We know there are vocalists and wind players in the valley for whom our
festival would be a great experience, and we believe they will show up.  We need your help to get over this first
hump. </p>
<p><b>New Festival Programs</b></p><p>Many participants and audience members have, in
the past, been disappointed that we did not have a festival program where they
could see all the participants, their performance times, learn about our
adjudicators, and hear about like-minded people in the community.  This year, we hope to put one of these
together to satisfy this demand.  Printing
costs are high, however, and none of us have any design experience.  This would be the first thing we would need
to pay somebody else to do for us.  </p>
<p><b>...And If the $2,500 Doesn't Happen?</b></p><p>If we
don’t our entire goal, our priorities would be:</p>
<p>1)Fulfill Provincial Obligations and give support to invited students</p><p>2)Make new instrument groups available in our festival</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">3)Make a  Festival Program</span><br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>The Bow
Valley Music Festival has already run, successfully, for five years.  This project is about creating a festival as
good as any other here in the Bow Valley. 
Whether or not this project funds will not change whether or not we have
a festival; funding this project allow us to grow into what we all dream it
will be.  </p>
<p>The Bow
Valley Music Festival is not a competition, but a celebration.  It celebrates the countless hours of hard
work by all the performers.  It showcases
them, proudly, as musicians and artists. 
It puts them in touch with others their age who also love music and want
to excel at it.  It celebrates who they
are. </p>
<p>It’s
easy, here in the Bow Valley, to love sports and outdoor stuff – and that’s
great! It’s hard to love music and arts, but we can change that.  With your help, we can make arts cool too. </p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>As I
mentioned, the Bow Valley Music Festival will run whether or not we are fully
funded here.  We will simply need to
assess what we are able to do.  Instead
of “all of it”, we will have to piecemeal it. 
With no funding, growth will be nearly impossible.  The biggest challenge of all will be staying
relevant at our current size and funding amount.  </p>
<p>It is
possible that we hire adjudicators for these new instrument groups and nobody
shows up.  We have already been spreading
the word amongst teachers and community members that we intend to do this, and
the response has been positive.  It is
impossible to know before registration opens whether or not this will be an
opportunity that the community capitalizes on, but we are out there doing what
we can so that, at least, nobody can say “I didn’t know”.  </p>
<p>Rest
assured that your contribution will be used. 
100% of our funding goes directly to programming, and it will be no
different here.  We will use every dollar
contributed to better our festival.  </p>

    The Impact Highly acclaimed educator, Gloria Ladson-Billings (1999) noted that the most current innovations in schools are not typically written about and communicated, because the people doing the work are busy doing the work.  We are trying to counter that reality, because we truly believe we have a lot to offer to the greater urban education community, particularly teacher preparation programs, urban teacher pipeline programs, teacher development providers, and of course, schools.  At the same time, we are not arrogant to say that we have all the answers, so we know that through our systematic research, we will be able to problematize, name, and better understand our current work in order to determine how to intentionally improve for our students.


    Other Ways You Can Help Even if you can't financially contribute to our cause, you can still help.  Please spread the word to your family, friends, and colleagues.  You can also set us up to use your timeshare in Philadelphia, if you have one.  If you have experience publishing your work, we would love to get your advice and expertise for making our findings more widely accessible.",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p></p><h1><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">What is Papalotes?</b></h1>
<p>Papalotes is a community project run by parents and teachers in Puerto Escondido, Mexico. We believe there is a huge need to offer an alternative education model in Mexico since the traditional model is failing. That is why we have taken the initiative to create a different option, turning a tiny part of the world into a friendlier place.</p>
<p>The project currently offers a Waldorf-inspired activities for nearly 30 students, ages 2 to 10 from a variety of backgrounds including local kids with full scholarships. The project is 100% non-profit and legally established. Living in one of the poorest states in Mexico, we firmly believe that if we want to create a better world, we need to educate our children differently.</p>

<h1><b>What do we want?</b></h1>
<p>We think that children have the right to develop healthily in body, mind and spirit. We teach them how to deal with their emotions, to respect nature and their fellow beings. We let them explore the world freely, inspire them to question themselves and to learn things that make sense to them in their lives. Although academics are important, there is so much more to life than that! We are encouraging critical reasoning and the social and artistic sensitivity that form free and morally responsible individuals. Children naturally love learning, and we support ours to become learners for life. Educating our young ones for an uncertain future that we cannot predict but that we can create, we want our students to keep their human side intact. That is why we foster them to be compassionate and empathetic; share and work as a team.</p><p><br/></p>
<h1><b>We are pioneers</b></h1>
<p>We are pioneers planting new seeds: loving and caring teachers; free children; committed parents. We have created a project where exploration and experimentation is the base, and where it is alright to make mistakes because it is the mistakes that make us learn and grow. We are pioneers of a project that respects the rhythm of each child, where play is part of the learning process. More than pioneers of an alternative system, we are pioneers of education as the only true alternative for a positive change in the world.</p><p><br/></p>
<h1><b>Success = Growth</b></h1>
<p>Due to our success in the first three years of the project we have outgrown our current campus, but thankfully we have found the perfect building that suits our pedagogical and philosophical needs, with a beautiful garden where the children can explore freely and safely.</p>

Se llama ""Estadio de Los Ángeles"", en honor a la generosa donación realizada por la gente de Los Ángeles.Mi padre Lino, quien me inspiró a comenzar esta caridad en 2011, lamentablemente murió de cáncer de estómago en julio de 2013.  Dedico esta caridad a él y me gustaría seguir dando  a mi comunidad guatemalteca en su honor, e inspirar a otros a hacer lo mismo.El trabajo de caridad sólo puede continuar con el apoyo de personas como usted. Sus amables donaciones darán a los niños de Guatemala una oportunidad para una educación y con la educación que pueden ayudar e inspirar a su comunidad a crecer y prosperar.  Con su regalo, usted ayudará a cumplir con las esperanzas y los sueños de estos niños para un futuro mejor.

<p> With your help, In March 2016, I will be traveling to Hoi An, Vietnam .  It will be a difficult four-month training period that will prepare me for the real world of professional SCUBA diving.  With this certification, I will be qualified to safely lead divers into the water.  My mission will be to change lives and alter perspectives on our Oceans .  As a divemaster, I can help to tackle
environmental issues concerning our oceans through awareness, and by facilitating a divers direct, intimate relationship to the underwater world.  The closer I can bring people to the ocean, the less they are going to want to harm it.</p>

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>Positive Impact for Young People CIC was established in 2017 to tackle social exclusion by supporting vulnerable young people aged 11-19 who are disengaged from Education, Employment or Training from Nuneaton, North Warwickshire and surrounding areas.  Positive Impact for Young People CIC use a strength-based approach to develop young people’s skills, increase resilience and re-engage young people into Education, Employment or Training.    </p>
<h3>The Bakery</h3>
<p>We're extremely excited to announce our brand-new project, The Bakery, a social enterprise that will invest in supporting young people to develop transferable skills and learn the art of baking in a real working environment.</p>
<p>The Bakery is exactly what it says on the tin, serving real, honest and fresh artisan breads, cakes and pastries to the general public and trades. The Bakery project will sustain and support the growth of the organisation, ensuring we work and support more and more young people who need us.</p>
<p>But this is where we need your help.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have our premises, our managing director is a trained bakery chef, and has a degree in Youth Work, we even have the young people who need this support. What we require now is to fill our bakery with the equipment we need!</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to raise <strong>£10,000</strong> to create the exciting bakery and cafe space we want these young people to <strong>feel proud to work in</strong>, and for our customers to <strong>love to spend time in</strong><br/> </li>
<li>We're offering you the chance to be one of our <strong>early investors</strong>, by donating your money in return for <strong>lifetime membership</strong> of our<strong> investors club </strong>at bronze, silver, gold or platinum level - giving you <strong>exclusive discounts</strong> at The Bakery<br/> </li>
<li>We've even got some great branded <strong>items to give away</strong> to our investors<br/> </li>
<li>Whatever we're able to raise through this campaign will all go to supporting <strong>vulnerable young people aged 11-19</strong> who are disengaged from Education, Employment or Training from Nuneaton, North Warwickshire and surrounding areas</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Bakery will make a huge difference to the lives of local vulnerable young people, allowing them to develop their confidence, knowledge, self-esteem, communication skills and teamwork.</p>
<p>There is <strong>no other provision of this type</strong> within the local area.</p>
<p>We will focus on young people’s ability to engage in an workplace environment to gain important life skills which will promote sustainability, increase confidence, build teamwork through peer to peer engagement and improve physical and mental well-being, supporting them to reach their full potential.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We're in this for the long-run, but as well as our setup costs, there are ongoing costs for the premises, energy, staffing etc - we're <strong>really confident </strong>we'll easily be able to cover these costs in the long term - our current plan actually shows us able to reinvest some of our surplus into other local projects for young people.</p>
<p>There's always a risk with starting a new venture like this - but we think it's a risk worth taking to support these vulnerable individuals, allowing them to fulfil their potential.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Although financial support would be amazing... if you're not able to help us in that way, there's still so much you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the word out and make some noise about us - the more the merrier</li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools to share online with your friends</li>
<li>We'd also love to hear from you if you'd like to volunteer your time to help us get set up</li>

<h2><span>What is Lemonade Day?</span></h2>
<p>America was built on the back of small business. Entrepreneurs take risks believing they can realize their dream if they work hard, take responsibility and act as good stewards of their resources. Today’s youth share that optimism, but lack the life skills, mentorship and real-world experience necessary to be successful.</p>
<p>Lemonade Day is a nationwide event that teaches kids the skills they need to be successful in life. Kids learn to set goals, develop a business plan, establish a budget, seek investors, provide customer service, save for the future, and give back to the community. Lemonade Day is the perfect opportunity for a community to show kids they care and train the next generation of entrepreneurs through a free, fun, engaging, and empowering activity.</p>Lemonade Day is a <b>FREE</b>, step by step program that walks youth from a dream to a business plan, while teaching them the principles required to start and run their own company...a lemonade stand. Inspiring kids to work hard and make a profit, Lemonade Day also teaches them to spend some, save some, and share some by giving back to their community.<img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><br/><p></p>

<h2><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Who's in charge?</b></h2>
<p>My name is <a href=""http://linkd.in/1CavVzd"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chip Conrad</a>. I am a serial entrepreneur from here in the Pacific Northwest. From an early age I knew I wanted to start and run my own business. Since that time I have started 4 businesses of my own and been involved in many other start-ups. Last year I started the Center for Entrepreneurial Education and Development (CEED) and shortly after we adopted the <a href=""lemonadeday.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lemonade Day</a> program, a nationally franchised program that teaches middle schoolers how to start and run their first business...a lemonade stand.</p>
<h2><b><b>How does it work?</b></b></h2>
</div><div>In early March we launch the program by opening up online registration. Simultaneously marketing through TV, radio, print and social media will start to direct audiences to our registration page. Participants sign up and receive and email guiding them to the nearest pick-up locations where they get a backpack full of materials and helpful inserts from our sponsors.

</div></div>","What is Lemonade Day?
America was built on the back of small business. Entrepreneurs take risks believing they can realize their dream if they work hard, take responsibility and act as good stewards of their resources. Today’s youth share that optimism, but lack the life skills, mentorship and real-world experience necessary to be successful.
Lemonade Day is a nationwide event that teaches kids the skills they need to be successful in life. Kids learn to set goals, develop a business plan, establish a budget, seek investors, provide customer service, save for the future, and give back to the community. Lemonade Day is the perfect opportunity for a community to show kids they care and train the next generation of entrepreneurs through a free, fun, engaging, and empowering activity.Lemonade Day is a FREE, step by step program that walks youth from a dream to a business plan, while teaching them the principles required to start and run their own company...a lemonade stand. Inspiring kids to work hard and make a profit, Lemonade Day also teaches them to spend some, save some, and share some by giving back to their community.



Who's in charge?
My name is Chip Conrad. I am a serial entrepreneur from here in the Pacific Northwest. From an early age I knew I wanted to start and run my own business. Since that time I have started 4 businesses of my own and been involved in many other start-ups. Last year I started the Center for Entrepreneurial Education and Development (CEED) and shortly after we adopted the Lemonade Day program, a nationally franchised program that teaches middle schoolers how to start and run their first business...a lemonade stand.
How does it work?
In early March we launch the program by opening up online registration. Simultaneously marketing through TV, radio, print and social media will start to direct audiences to our registration page. Participants sign up and receive and email guiding them to the nearest pick-up locations where they get a backpack full of materials and helpful inserts from our sponsors. From there the mentor and youth participant start their journey towards entrepreneurship by taking part in several of the community events we have planned for them along the way. Then, on May 3rd, they open their lemonade stand putting to use the principles they've learned throughout the experience.


What We Need & What You Get
We need to hit our goal in order for us to pay to execute the program. This covers the required educational materials for the participants and operational expenses in each of our three cities.
Your donation has a massive impact at any level. When you decide to donate $25, you have changed one kids life forever. And when you decide to donate by signing on as a sponsor, the advertising benefits and community engagement are outstanding.
Lemonade Day is an annual program so the extra funds we receive will roll over to next year when we hope to launch to more states here in the west.
How will the funds be used?





The Impact

In Salem last year over 1,000 kids started their first business. In a 4 hour period they sold $30,000 worth of lemonade. What would you have done with the Lemonade Day program if it had been an option when you were in middle school? What would you have done with 14 basic principles teaching you how to start a business? What affect would it have on your career now?
At CEED, we move fast and break things. We took a risk by bringing the first Lemonade Day to the west coast and we broke records. We are now taking more risk than we ever have by expanding so quickly. We have added to that risk by pre-purchasing the licenses and materials to run this program because we feel our community deserves this and we are the organization to bring it to our youth. 
We have formed partnerships with amazing organizations like Oregon Entrepreneurs Network, Technology Association of Oregon, Portland Incubator Experiment, the Chamber of Commerce and Google for Entrepreneurs that give us that reach into all three cities. These organizations bring credibility and know-how to help us execute on the highest level.

<div>Help me open a centre dedicated to helping people with neurological disorders (such as Autism Spectrum Disorders, Traumatic Brain Injuries, and learning/developmental delays) live up to their full potential.  The focus will be on social skills, life skills, and managing behaviours.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The Way I Learn will begin by offering two essential services with plans to provide more in the future. Two services that will be available immediately are; Full day services for adolescents and adults, Intensive Behavioural Intervention services for all ages.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Full Day Services: All day programs designed to keep the mind and body engaged throughout the day.  Although these programs will take place in a group setting, an individualized method of teaching is necessary.  This is to ensure that each person is learning at their own pace and based on their specific level of functioning.  The goal is to help them maintain skills learned over the years and to acquire new ones which would promote independence, initiation and self regulation.  </span><br/>
</li>
<li>Intensive Behavioural Intervention:  IBI is an evidence-based intervention for children with autism.  IBI is based on principles and techniques of Applied Behavioural Analysis.  It can be a mixture of instructional strategies.  Intervention should be implemented twenty to forty hours a week for at least two years.  The purpose of IBI is to learn skills equivalent to the level of neuro-typical children around the same age.  Some of these skills include academic, communicative, social and life skills.  Because every child is different, an individualized assessment is required to determine the child’s <p>strengths and weaknesses.  Based on this assessment, an individualized curriculum is created and covers a wide range of domains and is then implemented by well trained and supervised staff. </p>
<p>Data is collected to monitor and measure changes in behavior as well as progress in acquiring new skills.  Acquisitions need to be generalized.  This is important in order to ensure the child’s acquired skills are used in different environments with different people and that they are retained over time.  In order to achieve generalization of skills, the use of varied materials, instructions, settings and instructors are crucial.  A child’s program will change based on progress in order to continue acquiring skills. </p>

<h3>About Myself</h3>
<div>I'm a Registered Social Service Worker, happy to say I have been working with people with Autism Spectrum Disorders as an Instructor Therapist for the last eight years.  I have been providing one on one in-home therapy to people of all ages ranging in severity on the spectrum. I work with a multidisciplinary team of experts and use evidence based interventions and strategies to work on social skills, life skills, academics, and manage behaviour.  I have seen so much progress with my clients over the years, this includes increasing language and communication skills, gaining independence, reducing behaviours,  and school success.  Last year I also began working with people who acquired Traumatic Brain Injuries.  My past experience also includes conducting psychological assessments to identify psychological outcomes for people involved in catastrophic motor vehicle accidents to identify need or urgency for psychological treatment.</div>

<h2><b>Why More Services Are Needed</b></h2>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Over the years it has become more and more evident that there are not enough services for people with special needs.   There is a huge service gap in Mississauga, especially for adults.  Since being in this field, many people have expressed concerns in finding quality programs for their loved ones.  Many also expressed they are having difficulty financing them, services are too far, and individual needs are not being met.  T</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">here are not enough high quality and affordable services available and the few that offer full day programs are too far, long wait lists, basic services are costly, essential programs are not included in price and cost extra. </span>

<div>The purpose of this centre to help people live up to their full potential regardless of age or level of functioning. The two services available are designed to be individualized with an emphasis on Natural Environment Teaching to ensure skills and knowledge gained are generalized and maintained.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Full day services for adults: I want to keep the price of services fair and include all activities in the original cost at no extra charge.  I do not want any of the future clients to be excluded from activities that would be beneficial just because families can't afford to pay the extra cost.  It can become very expensive for families to pay extra for each activity.  Although this will be done in a group setting (5:1 ratio clients:instructors), goals are individualized and activities can be modified to ensure each person is engaged to the best of their ability and encouraged to maintain, acquire and generalize skills. The focus is teaching life skills, social skills, promote independence and manage/self regulate emotions and behaviors.  </span></p>
<p>IBI: It is with great honor to say the brilliant Psychologist Dr. James Porter will be available for diagnostic and psycho-educational assessment and is one of the potential Clinical Supervisors.  The multidisciplinary team so far really is a dream team! Properly trained and supervised instructors,
individualized programs, generalization and accurate data collecting are all
key ingredients to successful IBI. Natural Environment Teaching is one of those key ingredients to success and will be a major component in IBI programs. <br/></p>

<p>Your contribution will help me achieve my goal to get The Way I Learn up and running.  If I meet my goal, I will have it open for October 2015.</p>
<p>This centre will help so many people with special needs!  My ultimate goal is to see more people with special needs succeed in school, join the workforce and live an independent life.  With my years of experience, history of success, the extraordinary multidisciplinary team, I am confident everyone enrolled in this centre will benefit greatly in a variety of ways on different levels from the services it has to offer. </p>
<p>The Way I Learn will help fill a service gap,  and will create jobs in my community and surrounding areas. My plan is to also employ people with disabilities, I believe in equal opportunities and unfortunately the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is way too high.  This needs to be changed. </p>
<br/></span></span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></span></div> </div> <div> <h3>What The Way I Learn Needs &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>I need this funding to help with the start up costs of this centre.  The first month I need to set up the centre, furnish it, and train staff in order for potential clients to be able to come in and take a look around.  Clients who sign up for services will have individualized programs which takes some time to put together because each person's individual needs and goals are very important to ensure they benefit from programs offered.  The centre will not generate money the first few months, yet I will still need to cover the overhead costs which includes but not limited to rent, hydro, payroll, insurance, etc. </div>
<div>
<p>I really need this funding because I have applied for business loans,
personal loans, lines of credit and I have been denied for all of them.  I have been self employed for 8 years, and
even though my credit score is excellent, the fact that I’m self employed is an
issue for the banks.  It doesn't help that the interest rates have gone down once again and expected to continue to drop along with the Canadian dollar.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If I cannot reach my goal, whatever funds gained could be used to show
the bank that there is a big interest in the centre and will have a much better
chance at getting a loan.  I have already
looked into this and I feel confident I would get a loan or line of
credit.  I have been and will continue to
host events to raise money.  It may take
me longer to open the centre, but it will open! Should I surpass the goal I can make huge
improvements to the centre, hire more staff, offer ride programs for pick up
and drop off and much more.  Should
anything happen to me before the centre opens, money raised will go to ErinOak
Kids family services and is included in my will.</p>
<p>Since every contribution regardless of the amount plays an important role in the opening of the centre, I will have a page on the website dedicated to all those who supported The Way I Learn.  </p>

However, this is not yet the case for most of the Former Soviet Union countries within our network. The waste management system in these places is still a remnant of the past; it's badly out of date and can’t fulfill the needs of modern world citizens. Therefore, the conference will be a cornerstone for development of strong partnerships in order to create and implement new technologies, raise awareness of waste management bottlenecks in former Soviet nations, and evaluate strategies to replicate citizen-led solutions that have proven themselves in Western European countries. <strong><br/></strong></p><p><strong>WHAT WE NEED</strong></p><p>We need financial support to organise our conference where we plan to:</p><ul>
<li><p>Exchange experience between existing volunteering teams and new partners to better and more efficiently enact successful campaigns in new host countries</p></li>
<li><p>Develop and strengthen the partnerships between Let’s Do It! teams, NGO’s and Public Institutions in Eastern Co-op Countries</p></li>
<li><p>Recruit, educate and motivate new teams to expand the reach of their project</p></li>
<li><p>Develop 3-year strategic plans for Let’s Do It! Eastern Co-op Countries to achieve success</p></li>
</ul><p>Funds will be used to organise translation services, logistics and facility costs, educational materials, basic administrative costs, and production of follow up materials.</p><p><strong>WHAT YOU GET</strong></p><p></p><p>As a token of our gratitude, we’ll be happy to present you with a small special thank you from Let’s Do It community.

При нормальных обстоятельствах правительству для достижения такого результата потребовалось бы три года и 22500000 €.

World (www.letsdoitworld.org). In 2008, 50,000 people from Estonia (around 4% of the population) came together to clean 10,000 tons of trash from roadsides, forests and towns in 5 hours. Under normal circumstances it would have taken the government three years and €22,500,000 to clean up the same amount. Our initiative inspired our Latvian and Lithuanian neighbours to adopt the One-Day-One-Country  model, and by 2015 our community has grown into strong network that unites 112 countries and 13 000 000 volunteers around the world.WHY WE DO ITWe do what we do because we truly believe that with as little as 5% of the world’s population, we can launch a global clean up campaign to shift public attitude and civic policy for each participating nation. We believe that social activities of such scale are crucial to prepare the residents of our planet for major changes on personal, social and governmental levels and catalyze sustainable solutions for governments, communities, private enterprise and society overall.  HOW WILL WE DO IT Our goal is to engage 5% of the population of Eastern Europe and Central Asia by 2018 within an unprecedented clean-up campaign and ignite a major social change. In order to make this happen, we rely on funding for a number of educational and development initiatives. Our current project is to organise a workshop filled conference for Eastern Co-op Countries (Ukraine, Russia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Moldova, Mongolia, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Georgia, Turkmenistan and Belarus) planned for this November in Kiev, Ukraine.Clean streets and effective waste management system are taken for granted within much of the EU. However, this is not yet the case for most of the Former Soviet Union countries within our network. The waste management system in these places is still a remnant of the past; it's badly out of date and can’t fulfill the needs of modern world citizens. Therefore, the conference will be a cornerstone for development of strong partnerships in order to create and implement new technologies, raise awareness of waste management bottlenecks in former Soviet nations, and evaluate strategies to replicate citizen-led solutions that have proven themselves in Western European countries. WHAT WE NEEDWe need financial support to organise our conference where we plan to:
Exchange experience between existing volunteering teams and new partners to better and more efficiently enact successful campaigns in new host countries
Develop and strengthen the partnerships between Let’s Do It! teams, NGO’s and Public Institutions in Eastern Co-op Countries
Recruit, educate and motivate new teams to expand the reach of their project
Develop 3-year strategic plans for Let’s Do It! Eastern Co-op Countries to achieve success
Funds will be used to organise translation services, logistics and facility costs, educational materials, basic administrative costs, and production of follow up materials.WHAT YOU GETAs a token of our gratitude, we’ll be happy to present you with a small special thank you from Let’s Do It community. Don’t forget to check the “perks” section to find out more about the different things you can get as a thank you for your support. We offer:

(www.letsdoitworld.org). В 2008 году 50000 человек из Эстонии (около 4% населения) собрались вместе, чтобы очистить окраины дорог, лесов и населенных пунктов от 10000 тонн мусора всего за 5 часов. При нормальных обстоятельствах правительству для достижения такого результата потребовалось бы три года и 22500000 €. Инициатива движения вдохновила соседние с Эстонией страны, Латвию и Литву, перенять сработавшую модель - одна страна - один день, а к 2015 году наше движение выросло в сильную сеть, объединяющую 112 стран и 13 000 000 волонтеров по всему миру.ПОЧЕМУ МЫ ЭТО ДЕЛАЕММы делаем то, что делаем, потому что действительно верим, что с вовлечением всего 5% населения планеты во всемирную кампанию по уборке, мы сможем изменить отношение общественности к проблемам и нуждам окружающей среды, что повлечет за собой глобальные перемены. Мы убеждены, что социальная активность такого масштаба имеют решающее значение для подготовки жителей нашей планеты к крупным изменениям на личном, общественном и государственном уровнях и послужит стимулом к принятию взвещенных и осознанных решений для устойчивого развилия цивилизации.КАК МЫ ХОТИМ ДОБИТЬСЯ РЕЗУЛЬТАТАНаша цель заключается в привлечении 5% населения Восточной Европы и Центральной Азии к 2018 году в рамках беспрецедентной кампании по уборке для создания крупных социальных изменений. Для осуществления задуманного, мы расчитываем на финансовую поддержку ряда образовательных инициатив и проектов. Наш текущий проект - организация международной конференции для стран Восточного содружества Let’s Do It! (Украина, Россия, Азербайджан, Узбекистан, Молдова, Монголия, Таджикистан, Кыргызстана, Казахстан, Армения, Грузия, Туркменистан и Беларусь), запланированной на ноябрь этого года в Киеве, Украина.Чистые улицы и эффективная система управления отходами являются само собой разумеющимися вещами в большей части ЕС. Однако, для большинства стран СНГ в рамках нашей сети, эти блага еще не являются реальностью: система управления отходами устарела и не может удовлетворить потребностям современного человека. В виду выщесказанного, конференция станет краеугольным камнем для развития прочных партнерских связей в целях создания и внедрения новых технологий, повышения уровня осведомленности среди населения о проблемах загрязнения окружающей среды и изменение поведения как отдельного человека, так и общества в целом, разработке стратегий внедрения практик, которые успешно зарекомандовали себя в странах Западной Европы  для устойчивого развития всего региона.ЧТО НАМ НУЖНОМы нуждаемся в финансовой поддержке в организации конференции, где мы планируем:

Обмен опытом между существующими командами добровольцев и потенциальными членами движения Let’s do it!, для проведения более эффективных кампаний в странах Восточного содружества


Развитие и укрепление партнерских отношений между командами Let’s do it!, представителями различных некоммерческих организаций и правительственных учреждений в странах содружества


Набор новых участников движения, обучение и мотивирование новые команд для расширение границ проекта


Разработка единого 3-летнего стратегического плана развития стан Восточного содружества Let’s do it! для достижения поставленной цели к 2018 году

Средства будут использованы для организации услуг по переводу, логистики и покрытия проектных затрат на учебные материалы, основные административные расходы, а также производство необходимых материалов.ТО, ЧТО ВЫ ПОЛУЧАЕТЕВ знак нашей признательности, мы будем рады сделать Вам небольшой подарок от движения Let’s do it!

<p>We love pie. To say that we are pie enthusiasts would be an understatement. In fact, we think that pie can change the world. AND WE NEED YOUR HELP!!!. The youth leaders of Pie Ranch need to get to Philadelphia on July 27th to attend the Rooted In Community National Network conference. These youth leaders are inspired to connect people to know the source of their food and to work together to bring greater health to the food system from seed to table. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Every year hundreds of young people gather in a different city to share this common vision at the Rooted in Community conference. RIC is a national grassroots network that empowers young people to take leadership in their own communities. It is a movement of youth and adults working together, committed to fostering healthy communities and food justice through urban and rural agriculture, community gardening, food security, and related environmental justice work. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pie Ranch's connection to Rooted In Community helps support the critical work we do with our youth here in the bay area. RIC offers technical training in community organizing, hard skills in organic agriculture, the opportunity to network with youth across the country, and is a tremendous inspiration to the young people at Pie Ranch. </p>
<p>This year we are striving to bring a talented group of 4 to represent Pie Ranch's commitment to food justice, to enhance and inform our efforts, and to bring critical information and connections back to California.  <br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It is our belief that if our team can make it to Philadelphia, we can create a healthier bay area. After attending the RIC conference two years ago, one youth leader from Pacifica returned as a high school sophmore to start a 1/8 acre school garden, organize fellow classmates, and rally teacher and administartive support! At 15 yrs. old.! Being able to send this group of youth provides the training and support they need to commit to social &amp; food justice projects here in California that create a healthier world for us all. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>""Having Attended RIC two years ago, I have seen the power of RIC to inspire individuals and give insight in to the work that hundreds of other people are doing throughout the country. It is an amazing opportunity to share what we are doing with other people and to see and be inspired by the projects of others. The opportunity presented by RIC to collaborate with others and learn from their work is one that is unparalleled and one that has allowed me to employ the skills and ideas I acquired at RIC two years ago in my community back at home. I intend to return from RIC with new skills and renewed inspiration to continue my work at Pie Ranch and at Oceana High School.""  Naftali Moed, Oceana High School Student<br/></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $3500 to get to Philadelphia. </p>
<p>The plane tickets are $600 each, and the conference fees are $155 per youth and $205 per adult. </p>
<p>We also need $300 extra for food, travel and misc. expenses related to the trip.</p>

Where are we going? When will we get there? What will we do when we get there?</em></p>
<p>As you might imagine, the parents didn’t have the answers ... well, none that would satisfy their children, who really needed - some might say deserved - answers.</p>
<p>An idea started to form in my head and I set about combining my business, marketing and writing experience with my passion for travel.</p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://www.boundround.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bound Round</a> was born.</strong></p>
<p>At Bound Round we've begun creating interactive travel guide apps for children.  Yes, there are plenty of popular travel guides already – but the significant gap in the market is for <strong>interactive </strong>travel guides that are <strong>designed for children</strong> but are <strong>relevant to both children AND parents</strong>. </p>
<p>What are my qualifications in this area? Well, it turns out I have had to draw on all my experience to bring this idea to life – my skills in marketing strategy and business development, writing and project management. Add to this my passion for travel and my interest in children’s entertainment and education, and my fabulously supportive network of friends and colleagues, and in 12 months, Bound Round has gone from concept to reality.</p>
<p>Bound Round apps entertain and educate children who are lucky enough to travel, but we also want to help those who are not so fortunate. So we've partnered with not-for-profit <a href=""http://www.roomtoread.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Room to Read</a>, and will donate $0.05 from every Bound Round app sold to help them educate children in need.</p>
<h3><strong>What makes Bound Round fun <em>and</em> educational for kids?</strong></h3>
<p>We think that children should be given every opportunity to explore and experience the different cultures the world has to offer. Simple black and white text doesn’t exactly engage children or help parents plan their holiday.</p>
<p>Bound Round apps use stories, photos, videos and games to help kids uncover all the fun things to do while holidaying in a particular location. This gives them more of a vote in holiday planning, resulting in a more enjoyable trip for the entire family.</p>
<p>With Bound Round, children will be able to preview their destination and flag the places they think sound like fun, while the parents will have access to exclusive discounts for the venues the children rated on their ‘to do’ list.  </p>
<h3><strong>So kids, it means you can...</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Play Bound Round before you arrive at your destination and find out what's going to be fun to do there.</li>
<li>Highlight the places you like so you can show your parents (before they drag you to loads of places that sound boring).</li>
<li>Unlock cool games, videos and extra information for each place you read about... and play them any time, even without an Internet connection!</li>
<li>Use your Bound Round travel journal to keep track of all the amazing stuff you do on your trip, and even print it out to show your friends and family when you get home.</li>
<li>Get stamps in your Bound Round passport for each place you end up visiting.</li>
<li>Hunt for your Bound Round animal tour guide – like Kook the kookaburra -  while visiting any of the locations mentioned in the story and take your photo with them so you can show everyone you've been there</li>
<li>Send e-postcards to your friends and family while you’re away so they can see all the fun you’re having!</li>
</ul><h3><strong>And what about the adults?</strong></h3>
<p>Bound Round isn’t just for the kids –there are real benefits for parents, too.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bound Round guides entertain children on long journeys, giving you at least 45min of 'quiet time'.</li>
<li>Once downloaded, Bound Round can be used without an Internet connection, making it perfect for the car and the plane.</li>
<li>The apps keep track of the places your kids think sound fun, so you can build them into your itinerary.</li>
<li>We know the last thing you want is to do MORE research! So, Bound Round has an ‘Info for Adults’ section that reduces your workload by providing things like opening hours, contact details, locations and, where possible, a link to the venue's website, so you can find out all the information you need before you go there.</li>
</ul><p>But wait! There’s more!</p>
<ul>
<li>We know that holidays can be expensive, so we’ve negotiated some great Bound Round discounts for the destinations your kids have been reading about and want to visit. </li>
<li>The apps also capture feedback from other adult Bound Round users about specific destinations and the Bound Round app itself.</li>
</ul><p>If you’ll pardon the pun, we believe we’re creating well-rounded apps that will help make your family holidays even more enjoyable!</p>
<h3><strong>So why the campaign?</strong></h3>
<p>Creating Bound Round is very exciting, and we've got an amazing team working to launch Sydney, our first location, in November.</p>
<p>So far I've funded the app entirely on my own.  My team has put in thousands of hours for free to get the first Bound Round Sydney guide to where it is ... ready to launch in time for the Christmas holiday season!</p>
<p>But there's still a lot of work to do.... because let's face it, kids travel to loads of places other than Sydney!</p>
<p>The $30,000 we want to raise with this campaign will allow us to finish building Bound Round Sydney.  The money raised here will help cover the costs of development... which on their own are $30,000.</p>
<p>By supporting this campaign you'll be helping develop our future destinations ... you’ll have a vote in our creative process and the opportunity to feature in the app yourself! Getting involved at this stage of development also means you'll get access to some pretty cool perks that won’t be available in the future ... like a personalised, signed postcard from our award-winning photographer, Fiona Riches.</p>
<p>And for only $50, you'll get an invitation to the Bound Round launch party where you'll get to meet the creative team, and the kids will get to experience some of the fun things that are included in Bound Round Sydney.</p>
<p>Check out the other rewards listed over on the right side of this page!</p>
<h3><strong>What can I do to help if I can't pledge?</strong></h3>
<p>Spreading the word about Bound Round is just as helpful as contributing cash.  So, if you can't pledge money, we'd love you to share our story!  There are lots of ways you can do that:</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Welcome My Fiends !  </p>
<p>The Best Fiends Forever show!!  The above video is only a taste of what we have in the works and is mainly a sneak peek of whats to come and we wanted to make it fun, but we need your help!  Think of the Muppets or Sesame Street, but with some edge and some Batitude ;)  This is a project thats been in the making for many of years and started from ideas written in a notebook. Its now finally brought to life after putting the pieces together and the Fiends coming all together to make it happen . But it's in need of some support to help produce the shows in all areas. Your pledges will help us create sets, set pieces, props and so much more that we are in need of to continue. We are creating more characters along with storyboards for future episodes and thinking of great ways to entertain and most importantly teach the youth of today some much needed old fashion lessons in a very fun and very cool way.</p>
<p>We are in need of some decent audio equipment to record with, a lot of other gear that is too much to list, but it all will help us get the job done. Along with all the equipment and supplies, a lot of time and money is put into set building and cast. There is so much that goes into each episode and we would really love your help!</p>
<p>Please make a pledge and become a part of history!  We really hope to surpass our goal to continue to bring you bigger and better episodes. Every penny goes into the shows we create, and we set a small goal to at least help us get started. Thanks so much and stay tuned !!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As we stated above, we really feel that the values of the Golden Age are almost completely lost in the youth of today. We want to make it fun and mix in great lessons to help teach kids and the fans of those values, traditions, music, arts and entertaining material that is educating.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

I own a company called Green Beat Solutions which provides consulting in sustainabililty, and we are currently trying to create a Permaculture Institute in Tulum, Mexico.</p>
<p>During October and November of 2011, my wife Melanie and I led a permaculture project in Congo, where we helped a community of 500 Pygmies become self sustainable:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_YUQfHTKE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_YUQfHTKE</a></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.congoproject2011.blogspot.mx/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.congoproject2011.blogspot.mx/</a></p>
<p>During this amazing experience, we learned that it is sometimes better to provide help closer to one's own country; after all, charity begins at home... With just the money it cost us to buy the airplane tickets to Africa, we could have started a project here in Mexico.</p>
<p>Sadly, there are too many places in the world that need help, nutritious food, and education. So why not start nearby, within our own local communities and friends?</p>
<p>The Green Beat Permaculture Institute of Tulum will provide a center for local and Mayan peoples to get training and education in fields such as organic, bio-intensive agriculture, rain water catchment systems, residual water treatments, garbage management, soil creation by composting and mulching, and business skills in order to sell their surplus in local co-ops and to local restaurants and hotels.</p>
<p>Our goal is twofold: one, to have a center where courses, workshops, and guided tours can educate children and adults from Tulum and nearby Mayan communities  on the importance of eating healthy, organic, nutrient-packed foods as well as learning how to grow it without the use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers which are polluting the fragile underground river system that flows beneath the Yucatan Peninsula. The mission is to empower them so they can sell their produce to local restaurants and hotels.</p>
<p>Severe droughts in the past three years have prevented local Mayans from cultivating their stapled corn, squash and bean crops. Famined farmers need to learn rain water catchment systems in order to secure enough of this precious liquid for their crops to grow. Children need to learn that industrial agriculture, mismanaged cattle and GMO's are rapidly turning our planet into a dry, arid desert, and that it is possible to cultivate nutrient rich food in small areas through intensive, organic, friendly methods that save energy and resources and produce high yields.</p>
<p>The funding will go towards building the huts where we will host the workshops and courses. We will also use the money to build a volunteer/woofing facility where we will be able to sponsor up to 10 people to trade their work in exchange for food, shelter and educational experience.  This they will take back to their communities, where they will be able to implement what they learned and build a better, healthier life for themselves.</p>
<p>Funding will directly assist the building of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Woofing &amp; Volunteer cabins</li>
<li>Classroom and teaching hut</li>
<li>Buying tools for students: machetes, shovels, spades, etc</li>
</ol><div>If we dont reach the goal of $6000 USD, rest assure that your money will go towards the building of infrastructure for this project and that we will not stop working until the campus is finished and operational. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Your contribution will contribute not only to the local Mayan community who will have a center to learn, grow and sell their produce, but to the world at large, since we will also be providing a model that can be replicated in many rural areas of the world, while at the same time helping the tourism industry by providing fresh, organic produce grown by local communities for local restaurants and hotels.</div>

<p>Only 25% of Americans eat their daily fruits and veggies. And this number is even lower for people in low-income, high-risk neighborhoods like the one our kids live in.</p>
<p>That’s a big reason why 38% percent of kids in California are obese. They have adult diseases like high blood pressure and diabetes – and they’re carrying these problems into adulthood. </p>
<p>This makes us sad.</p>
<p>So we're changing that – saving the world with broccoli smiles.</p>
<p>We teach food literacy: understanding the impact of food on your health, your community and your environment. And we make it fun.</p>
<p>You can learn all about it on our website: <a href=""http://californiafoodliteracy.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://californiafoodliteracy.org/</a>.</p>
<p>The kids in our classes are learning how to cook, about nutrition, to eat right and enjoy healthy food. Our founder, Amber Stott, even dresses up like a giant carrot. We’re not interested in scaring people about bad food. We want people to feel inspired to eat good food.</p>
<p>This makes us smile. We hope it makes you smile too.</p>

<div><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></div>
<div>
<p>Since our inception, we have struggled fighting for student loan justice.  Specifically, we are fighting for the return of standard bankruptcy protections, refinancing rights, and other standard consumer protections to all student loans.  It is clear that no one in Washington DC is fighting for the citizen's interests on this issue.  This is why the problem has become so bad, and why we exist. <br/>We have, to this point, been self financed through our membership, and this has proven difficult given the size of our task with Congress.</p>
<p>We are currently seeking $3500 to pay for travel and lodging for 3-4 people to go to Washington D.C. to correct the massive dis- and misinformation that has been showered upon Congress by the student loan industry.  Our belief is that when Congress has the true facts, they will do the right thing, and pass legislation that meets our requirements for student loan justice.  We have already raised about half of the total trip cost of $6500</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
While no one wishes to file for bankruptcy for any reason, not having this (and other standard protections) has caused predatory lending behavior, led directly to astonishing increases in college tuition, resulted in inexcusably bad government oversight, criminal lending behavior, and academic waste and unchecked spending... all on the backs of the students...both rich and poor. Please see our <a href=""http://studentloanjustice.org/argument.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">argument</a> at the website, and read the articles posted on the main page to understand the problem, and read some of our member's <a href=""http://studentloanjustice.org/victims.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">stories</a> to understand the harm this has done to ordinary, decent citizens.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>By achieving our goal, the system will once again be reoriented such that all of these problems will begin to right themselves.  This will benefit ALL students, rich or poor.  It will also re-stabilize the lending system, which currently is certain to suffer the same fate as the subprime home mortgage system- or worse- if nothing is done.</div>

She was a writer, and during the times that she was procrastinating from her writing (which was most of the time) she enjoyed riding her bike, growing vegetables in a very small patch of dirt, and thinking up clever ways to earn money for the few extra things in life that would make her most happy. The budget was pretty tight, since she was still not a best-selling author, and she had about $20,000 in medical debts looming over her.</p><p>Aside from some health issues (which she didn't like to use to get pity) and those pesky debts, life was pretty good. Amanda had learned to find happiness in the little things of day-to-day life. She figured if she could be happy sitting on her tiny patio on a sunny day, listening to the wind breezing through the cottonwood leaves, and watching Bunnerz crunch on a stalk of parsley, that she was leading a pretty fulfilled life. No matter what might come tomorrow, if today was a good day, then she felt like she had done a good job with the time she had been allotted on this earth.</p><p>What she hadn't been expecting was an alien invasion, especially not right before her 40th birthday!</p><h3>Chapter One</h3><p>Amanda sat on the weathered bench, under the shade of a ""Walmart-special"" patio umbrella. The umbrella tilted awkwardly because it was cheap, and meant to be paired with a table for additional support. But there wasn't any room on the patio, or in the budget for both. </p><p>Suddenly, there was a horrendous roar overhead, but Amanda didn't look up. She was used to airplanes coming in to the Bellingham airport. The roar was going on for a bit longer than usual. Bunnerz was standing on her hind legs, ears erect. Amanda cooed at the startled bunny. ""Don't worry Bun, it's just a plane.""</p><p>But the noise didn't stop, and then the sky grew dark. Amanda peeked out from under her patio umbrella. The sun was gone, swallowed by the blackness of an enormous round Frisbee shape. A Frisbee even a giant would have trouble tossing! It obliterated half the sky. And she could see tiny dots floating down from it. </p><p>""Oh my God. What is that?"" Part of her wanted to run screaming, but as usual when there was an emergency, she slipped into calm, clinical mode. Maybe it was her writers' brain, or maybe it was because she had lost her adrenal glands to a surgery before she turned 21, but she never panicked in a crisis. Sometimes she panicked for ridiculous things, but not in the usual circumstances when other people were panicking.</p><p>And people were panicking. She heard screams and shouts from road, and from some of her neighbor's houses. She just squinted up at the sky trying to figure out what the little dots were.</p><p>When they got close enough to make out clearly, her first thought was: <i>""Boy those alien robots look really familiar, I could swear I have seen them before, like in some really awesome British Sci-Fi series on TV.""</i> But she dismissed the thought, because TV shows were fiction, of course. Not to mention, as a writer, she was sensitive to intellectual property stuff and didn't want to violate anyone's rights by stray thoughts, especially if she wrote the story down one day. So she settled on thinking of them as alien robots.</p><p>She opened the patio door and shooed the bunny inside. Bunnerz was terrified enough that for once she did not argue or lead Amanda on a merry chase. She hopped inside and went straight to her cage.

She was a writer, and during the times that she was procrastinating from her writing (which was most of the time) she enjoyed riding her bike, growing vegetables in a very small patch of dirt, and thinking up clever ways to earn money for the few extra things in life that would make her most happy. The budget was pretty tight, since she was still not a best-selling author, and she had about $20,000 in medical debts looming over her.Aside from some health issues (which she didn't like to use to get pity) and those pesky debts, life was pretty good. Amanda had learned to find happiness in the little things of day-to-day life. She figured if she could be happy sitting on her tiny patio on a sunny day, listening to the wind breezing through the cottonwood leaves, and watching Bunnerz crunch on a stalk of parsley, that she was leading a pretty fulfilled life. No matter what might come tomorrow, if today was a good day, then she felt like she had done a good job with the time she had been allotted on this earth.What she hadn't been expecting was an alien invasion, especially not right before her 40th birthday!Chapter OneAmanda sat on the weathered bench, under the shade of a ""Walmart-special"" patio umbrella. The umbrella tilted awkwardly because it was cheap, and meant to be paired with a table for additional support. But there wasn't any room on the patio, or in the budget for both. Suddenly, there was a horrendous roar overhead, but Amanda didn't look up. She was used to airplanes coming in to the Bellingham airport. The roar was going on for a bit longer than usual. Bunnerz was standing on her hind legs, ears erect. Amanda cooed at the startled bunny. ""Don't worry Bun, it's just a plane.""But the noise didn't stop, and then the sky grew dark. Amanda peeked out from under her patio umbrella. The sun was gone, swallowed by the blackness of an enormous round Frisbee shape. A Frisbee even a giant would have trouble tossing! It obliterated half the sky. And she could see tiny dots floating down from it. ""Oh my God. What is that?"" Part of her wanted to run screaming, but as usual when there was an emergency, she slipped into calm, clinical mode. Maybe it was her writers' brain, or maybe it was because she had lost her adrenal glands to a surgery before she turned 21, but she never panicked in a crisis. Sometimes she panicked for ridiculous things, but not in the usual circumstances when other people were panicking.And people were panicking. She heard screams and shouts from road, and from some of her neighbor's houses. She just squinted up at the sky trying to figure out what the little dots were.When they got close enough to make out clearly, her first thought was: ""Boy those alien robots look really familiar, I could swear I have seen them before, like in some really awesome British Sci-Fi series on TV."" But she dismissed the thought, because TV shows were fiction, of course. Not to mention, as a writer, she was sensitive to intellectual property stuff and didn't want to violate anyone's rights by stray thoughts, especially if she wrote the story down one day. So she settled on thinking of them as alien robots.She opened the patio door and shooed the bunny inside. Bunnerz was terrified enough that for once she did not argue or lead Amanda on a merry chase. She hopped inside and went straight to her cage. Amanda snapped the cage door closed before running back outside. No sense having to deal with an alien invasion and chewed speaker wires.As she stepped back out onto the patio robots with shiny metal dome heads and blocky bodies with no visible legs were slowly descending toward the ground with hover thrusters. There was one at each of her neighbor's homes, and one landing square on her patio. ""Hey!"" she shouted as the force of his thrusters blew her umbrella off its base. Without thinking, she grabbed the nearest object, an empty cooler. She gripped it by the handle and swung it with all her might at the robot's single eyepiece sticking out of its dome. The lens shattered and the robot spun in circles.""Error, error, error!"" It screamed in a voice that sounded like it was gargling water and speaking at the same time.""That's what you get when you mess with my umbrella you digital defect!"" She threw the cooler at it's head and then rammed the robot with her shoulder, toppling it over. Another hovering robot detached from its route and swung in her direction.""Desist human!"" It also screamed in the same voice as the one she had attacked. These robots seemed to only have one voice setting--overkill. Amanda didn't stick around to wait for it to arrive. Her neighbors were being herded out of their houses under guard. She was about to be wrangled with them. She dashed back into the house. Her cats were nowhere to be seen, probably hiding.

<b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 36px; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 40px; background-color: initial;"">Inspire youth to change the world through STEM!</b><br/>
</h2><p>Science and technology lie at the heart of the modern world, yet intensive STEM (science, tech, engineering and math) education is often regarded as too expensive, difficult or out of reach to bring to students in today’s under-resourced schools. ELiTE aims to change this notion by bringing cost-efficient, rigorous, and cutting-edge STEM programs to secondary school students across the world.</p><p>ELiTE is an education-focused nonprofit based in New York City. We are a young organization, composed of teachers, engineers, non-profit leaders, scientists, lawyers and entrepreneurs who came together five years ago to tackle the growing rift between science education and society, especially for students from lower income brackets. ELiTE seeks to empower low opportunity students from under-resourced backgrounds with engineering and science education to promote creative thinking and social responsibility. What began five years ago as a hands-on science summer camp in rural Ghana has since expanded to high school summer camps in Tanzania, Jamaica and Mexico, and year round student activities in Ghana and Harlem, NYC.</p><blockquote>
<b>“The ability to create is the most empowering thing to happen to an individual”</b>  <br/><span style=""font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;"">- Patrick Awuah, an ex-Microsoft techie and founder of Ashesi University, the top-ranked private liberal arts college in Ghana</span>
</blockquote><h2>Help ELiTE bring rigorous science education to more students!</h2><p>In the past six months, ELiTE has expanded programs across Harlem and abroad, running credit-bearing classroom instruction in computer programming, robotics and environmental science for students in 6th through 12th grade during the academic day, after school clubs, and summer camps. This summer we are developing new curriculum to include a bioengineering course that empowers students to address issues in global health through scientific principles. In this new course, students will apply the engineering design process to create low-cost medical devices that can be used in developing communities.</p><p><i>The catch? With a full-time staff of one employee (and many dedicated volunteers!), ELiTE needs to deepen it’s pockets and hire new team-mates!</i></p><p>ELiTE was founded on the support of friends, family and the ‘crowd’. In the next year, ELiTE has plans to expand the reach of our programs, through new curricula in more classrooms. We are once again calling on the public to support our cause and broaden the reach of impactful science and technology education to students in need. Every dollar we raise on this campaign will directly impact one of the new students we reach with enabling hands-on science education.</p><h2>The ELiTE Engine: A Recipe for Impact</h2><ul>
<li><p><b>Gears </b>(Equipment) - Equipment and materials are necessary in order to keep our wheels turning. Funding to purchase equipment for new STEM curricula, including open source-electronics like Raspberry Pi computers, Arduino microcontroller, probes, and other cool stuff will allow us to engage students in new ways this year.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Fuel </b>(Team) - Stipends for new hard-working facilitators who can guide students through our hands-on curricula and mentor them during their design projects. At ELiTE, we don’t call anyone ‘teachers’, because our students learn through discovery, exploration and team-work. Our facilitators lead and encourage our students, they don’t ‘instruct’ them!</p></li>
<li><p><b>Oxygen </b>(Capacity) - ELiTE has accomplished so much without a full-time staff, but imagine what we could accomplish with a team devoted entirely to ELiTE. Help us raise funds to hire a new staff member!</p></li>
</ul><h2>Let’s match donations from Google!</h2><p>Google has generously offered to match every dollar raised on Indiegogo up to $5,000. If we can reach $5000 in donations by June 27th, Google will give us another $5,000!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/632711/files/20140607163023-10346314_689607851104250_2029067796785392887_n.jpg?1402183823"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><h2>All students deserve access to STEM education!</h2><p>A traditional lack of access to exceptional academics, typically reserved for their affluent counterparts, significantly limits boys and girls alike from pursuing STEM coursework at a secondary or post-secondary level. The driving force of ELiTE’s school based programs is to deliver rigorous, high quality STEM instruction and expose underrepresented students to lucrative technology driven careers. Our programs also seek to better prepare students for success in their STEM coursework in and beyond high school. ELiTE partners with public schools who may not have the capacity to facilitate after-school and enrichment programming of this nature.</p><p>Schools systems, such as the NYC Board of Education, the largest in the nation, have been slow to respond to the urgency of increasing access to quality STEM instruction, leaving behind 70% of the student body. And although the NYCDOE is comprised of approximately 32% African American and 39% Latino students, African Americans and Latino students make up only 7% and 9% of the population in NYC’s top 10 high schools. High-needs students continue to lack access, enrollment and participation in more rigorous science and mathematics courses, greatly reducing their chances of gaining admission to top universities.</p><p>Various factors have been identified that significantly influence the participation of racial and ethnic minority students in STEM at the K-12 level. Among them are early exposure to STEM fields; STEM opportunity and support programs; interest in STEM careers; and self-efficacy in STEM subjects. Self-efficacy emphasizes the role of observational and experiential learning in a social context embedded in the learning process.</p><p>ELiTE’s program model directly addresses these core factors in an effort to guide more minority students into STEM careers. Our ambitious efforts to expand access to high-quality STEM academic programs have reached over 200 middle school and high school students in the past two years, along with hundreds of high school students at our international summer programs in Ghana, Jamaica, Tanzania and Mexico. Rather than leaving at-risk and under-resourced youth behind, let’s recognize their true potential and give them the tools to drive change in the future!</p><h2>Join the movement!</h2><ul>

Science and technology lie at the heart of the modern world, yet intensive STEM (science, tech, engineering and math) education is often regarded as too expensive, difficult or out of reach to bring to students in today’s under-resourced schools. ELiTE aims to change this notion by bringing cost-efficient, rigorous, and cutting-edge STEM programs to secondary school students across the world.ELiTE is an education-focused nonprofit based in New York City. We are a young organization, composed of teachers, engineers, non-profit leaders, scientists, lawyers and entrepreneurs who came together five years ago to tackle the growing rift between science education and society, especially for students from lower income brackets. ELiTE seeks to empower low opportunity students from under-resourced backgrounds with engineering and science education to promote creative thinking and social responsibility. What began five years ago as a hands-on science summer camp in rural Ghana has since expanded to high school summer camps in Tanzania, Jamaica and Mexico, and year round student activities in Ghana and Harlem, NYC.
“The ability to create is the most empowering thing to happen to an individual”  - Patrick Awuah, an ex-Microsoft techie and founder of Ashesi University, the top-ranked private liberal arts college in Ghana
Help ELiTE bring rigorous science education to more students!In the past six months, ELiTE has expanded programs across Harlem and abroad, running credit-bearing classroom instruction in computer programming, robotics and environmental science for students in 6th through 12th grade during the academic day, after school clubs, and summer camps. This summer we are developing new curriculum to include a bioengineering course that empowers students to address issues in global health through scientific principles. In this new course, students will apply the engineering design process to create low-cost medical devices that can be used in developing communities.The catch? With a full-time staff of one employee (and many dedicated volunteers!), ELiTE needs to deepen it’s pockets and hire new team-mates!ELiTE was founded on the support of friends, family and the ‘crowd’. In the next year, ELiTE has plans to expand the reach of our programs, through new curricula in more classrooms. We are once again calling on the public to support our cause and broaden the reach of impactful science and technology education to students in need. Every dollar we raise on this campaign will directly impact one of the new students we reach with enabling hands-on science education.The ELiTE Engine: A Recipe for Impact
Gears (Equipment) - Equipment and materials are necessary in order to keep our wheels turning. Funding to purchase equipment for new STEM curricula, including open source-electronics like Raspberry Pi computers, Arduino microcontroller, probes, and other cool stuff will allow us to engage students in new ways this year.
Fuel (Team) - Stipends for new hard-working facilitators who can guide students through our hands-on curricula and mentor them during their design projects. At ELiTE, we don’t call anyone ‘teachers’, because our students learn through discovery, exploration and team-work. Our facilitators lead and encourage our students, they don’t ‘instruct’ them!
Oxygen (Capacity) - ELiTE has accomplished so much without a full-time staff, but imagine what we could accomplish with a team devoted entirely to ELiTE. Help us raise funds to hire a new staff member!
Let’s match donations from Google!Google has generously offered to match every dollar raised on Indiegogo up to $5,000. If we can reach $5000 in donations by June 27th, Google will give us another $5,000!All students deserve access to STEM education!A traditional lack of access to exceptional academics, typically reserved for their affluent counterparts, significantly limits boys and girls alike from pursuing STEM coursework at a secondary or post-secondary level. The driving force of ELiTE’s school based programs is to deliver rigorous, high quality STEM instruction and expose underrepresented students to lucrative technology driven careers. Our programs also seek to better prepare students for success in their STEM coursework in and beyond high school. ELiTE partners with public schools who may not have the capacity to facilitate after-school and enrichment programming of this nature.Schools systems, such as the NYC Board of Education, the largest in the nation, have been slow to respond to the urgency of increasing access to quality STEM instruction, leaving behind 70% of the student body. And although the NYCDOE is comprised of approximately 32% African American and 39% Latino students, African Americans and Latino students make up only 7% and 9% of the population in NYC’s top 10 high schools. High-needs students continue to lack access, enrollment and participation in more rigorous science and mathematics courses, greatly reducing their chances of gaining admission to top universities.Various factors have been identified that significantly influence the participation of racial and ethnic minority students in STEM at the K-12 level. Among them are early exposure to STEM fields; STEM opportunity and support programs; interest in STEM careers; and self-efficacy in STEM subjects. Self-efficacy emphasizes the role of observational and experiential learning in a social context embedded in the learning process.ELiTE’s program model directly addresses these core factors in an effort to guide more minority students into STEM careers. Our ambitious efforts to expand access to high-quality STEM academic programs have reached over 200 middle school and high school students in the past two years, along with hundreds of high school students at our international summer programs in Ghana, Jamaica, Tanzania and Mexico. Rather than leaving at-risk and under-resourced youth behind, let’s recognize their true potential and give them the tools to drive change in the future!Join the movement!

There are formalities and procedures to follow both within the institution and also during reporting process with the relevant governmental authorities. Founding and establishing an institution is a great challenge that is what the eight years of the school has practically taught us and we will keep it up. The Impact: Female education in Afghanistan is not warranted by certain religious and traditional people. Refah School has the pride of educating female in co-education system in Afghanistan where females are not allowed even to attend segregated schools. Moreover female teachers have been employed who are restricted from jobs and appearing in public. Value to the contributor and to the world:Education is basic to a peaceful and prosperous life and society. It is the responsibility of all to take part in educating others especially when participation is possible by contributing a small amount of money otherwise it is a life long struggle. In countries like Afghanistan which has been destroyed because of international politics and interference, by now we are fortunate enough to play a positive role in bringing tranquility once again. Successful track record:It is the 8th successful year of Refah School serving the communities. During this period of time the capacities of the staff have been built in management and teaching. The reporting and communications with the Ministry of Education also have been properly established. A reality and a trust:Refah School has proved itself as a standard and capable institution educating the young pupils. The whole community has confidence in the school and they appreciate its role in over all development of the area. The Ministry of Education always gets the periodic reports on time and its officials has recorded their satisfaction during their periodic visits to the school. Risks & Challenges: Afghanistan is one of the most dangerous places on earth where ongoing insurgency is causing casualties on daily basis. Our children and teachers is under threat of being killed and school are bombed. We are already taking the risks for educating our new generation and making the world safer for us and also for our fellow beings. So far we have been successful and faced all the challenges and we expect that we will definitely win against all the odds.  Other Ways You Can Help: The Refah School as an institution has a comprehensive role in the lives of its pupils. We are in need of in-kind contributions as well. You can help us by donating your old computers, lap tops, printers, laboratory equipment, stationary and sports tools.Contact: Musarat Hussain,email: musarat.hussain@gmail.com",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","What We Do 

SCHOOL Kids Yoga Classes integrate yoga and meditation techniques, mindful movement, calm breathing, and themed stories to teach children how to self-initiate a calm body, brain, and most importantly, a calm heart.
We teach weekly, 20-minute classes for Pre-K through 5th grade students throughout the school year, because consistency is key to fostering positive social, emotional, and academic skills.
""My students have been able to focus more, listen more attentively, show respect for each other's feelings, and think before acting. I find myself stopping to breathe and calm my mind before reacting to stressful situations, especially in my classroom. I am so grateful to have been given the opportunity to be a part of this new learning for my students and for myself.” –Liz, 4th Grade Teacher 


We know the importance of giving children tools to self-regulate their emotions in the early years of life. SCHOOL nurtures social/emotional learning in our students at a crucial stage in their development. We teach self-confidence and the importance of caring for others -- so that today's children grow into adults who contribute to healthy communities. 
What sets us apart is our holistic approach, which addresses the needs of students, teachers, and the classroom as a whole. In addition to SCHOOL classes, we offer Teacher Trainings for public school teachers, who are eager to learn practical methods for managing the classroom and reducing stress.






Our Background
Kelly Wood (E-RYT 200, RCYT, RPYT) created the 501(c)(3) nonprofit SCHOOL, Inc. in 2012, drawing from more than 12 years experience teaching over 220,000 elementary school children. Kelly developed SCHOOL Kids Yoga Classes to help children and teachers in underserved public schools adapt constructively to growing stress and distraction, in school and in life. 


Our Goal
After a successful crowdfunding campaign last year, we were able to provide SCHOOL Kids Yoga Classes for 1,000 children and 50 public school teachers each week of the 2013-2014 school year. This year, more teachers and schools are requesting our classes. 
Your support will help us meet the growing demand for our programs in LA County schools for the 2014-2015 academic year. 
We are raising $5,000 to cover:
* Program expenses for SCHOOL classes
* Teacher fees ($20/class for lead teacher and those trained by Kelly)
* Training scholarships for public school teachers ($250 per teacher) 



DONATE NOW and join our mission to create positive, healthy learning environments!
With your generous donation, we will again reach over 1,000 children in LA Unified and Pasadena Unified School Districts in 2014-2015. Your support will also provide 20 scholarships for public school teachers to attend SCHOOL Teacher Trainings.

<h3>I have a student in Cambodia who I've been in touch with for the last few years. He currently works 20 hours per day and only makes the equivalent of $60 US per month, which is very little even considering how cheap the living costs are there. He asked me to help him with some money so he can return to school and provide for his family and village, as they can only afford rice and have very little to be sustained.</h3>
<h3>While I was teaching English there, he offered to help me be an interpreter for other students since his English was the best in class, and I have a special place for him in my heart. He's a wonderful person and it's hard for me to hear that he is struggling like this. I'm wondering if you'd be willing to help me by donating a few dollars so I can raise money for him to return to school so he can get a better job. Anything would help- There's no pressure at all, but it for a good cause.  Good Karma!  Always remember to pay it forward :)</h3>

<h3>What We're About...</h3>
<p><strong><em>Youth on the Move</em> (YOTM) is an after-school enrichment program for vulnerable middle school youth. These students are underserved and under-supported youth from low-income households.  </strong>Priority registration is given to students referred by counselors and teachers at Davidson Middle School in San Rafael, CA, where 60% of students qualify for free/reduced lunch (parents living at poverty level). Access to quality afterschool and summer activities for middle school youth is the number one concern of their parents, who often work two jobs to support their family in this otherwise affluent area of Marin County, California.</p>
<p>A unique component of this program is service-learning opportunities that teach youth life-skills as well as giving them the opportunity to make a real difference in their community. Service trips impact the students’ sense of belonging to a community in positive ways as they interact with intergenerational mentors.</p>
<p><em>Youth on the Move </em>provides a “safe place” for youth after school while promoting the many benefits of altruism, including increased self-assurance, empathy, mental and physical health, social and leadership skills. </p>
<p>YOTM is a non-sectarian program with no religious instruction. We are a 501 (3) (C) non-profit organization and 100% of your donation is tax-deductable.</p>
<p><strong><em>Help us raise $5,000 by August 23 to provide much-needed scholarships for this  program!</em></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why we need this funding...  KEEPING LIVES ON TRACK</h3>
<p>Students moving into adolescence face myriad challenges and opportunities, both in school and after school.  These students are too old for after-school child care programs, and opportunities for positive social, recreational, and developmental experiences are non-existent, not convenient, or too expensive for many Davidson students’ parents.  Many students need special help with school work as they undertake more challenging math, English and <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">social studies classes</span>.  Failure to successfully complete the middle school work and achieve positive transition to high school can lead to higher drop-out rates and the temptation to become involved in high-risk activities and groups.  </p>
<p>YOTM is offered Monday through Thursday from the end of school to 6 p.m., concurrent with both summer school and the regular school year.   At least two YMCA Counselors supervise daily activities, and volunteers assist with homework, snacks and field trips.  The program offers students: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>support</strong> for academic progress </li>
<li>
<strong>group community service</strong> with education and reflection components</li>
<li>
<strong>a wide variety of enrichment activities</strong> such as trips to museums</li>
<li>
<strong>wellness opportunities</strong> including sports, healthy cooking and snacks  </li>
</ul>
<p>Special experiences during the 2012-13 school year included a trip to the NASA Museum in Novato, swimming lessons at the YMCA, healthy cooking classes with <em>Kids Cooking for Life</em>, instruction in bike riding and care from “Trips for Kids,” visits to the Museum for the American Indian, the Marin Humane Society , “Wild Care,” and much more!</p>

<p>FPCSR members have funded this program for an entire year.</p>
<p>This project is sponsored by our Social Justice Committee, chaired by Board Member Leslie Purdy, a retired community college president; other leaders on the Committee and for this project include Nancy and Ed Boyce, founders of MarinLink, and Lorna Wuertz, retired assistant principal of the middle school that we will serve.  Assoc. Pastor Jan Reynolds, with a background in business and non-profit management directs the project.  Members of our church and other congregations, local students and non-profits leaders volunteer.</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Our congregation has funded this program through individual donations, but wider community support is now needed for this program to continue long-term.

<p>We were fortunate to get through this year; however, we felt it necessary to use some of the district budget to move forward. </p>
<p><strong>What does this mean?</strong> We are using district funds to match a grant application and at the same time begin the most critical work at West Park.  If we get the grant, we will replace some of the money into our 2012-2013 budget for necessary expenses.</p>
<p><strong>What will the project involve? </strong>We will fix the heating and water pipes at West Park this summer and replace most of the unit ventilators in classrooms.</p>
<p><strong>When will this portion of the repairs be complete? </strong>Prior to the start of the 2012-2013 school year.</p>
<p><strong>What do we lose when we spend these dollars? </strong>We lose text materials, classroom equipment and supplies and the ability to do any other high cost repairs that may be needed during the school year.</p>
<p><strong>Does this mean that we do not need any other funding for West Park or the district? </strong>No.  This is an emergency and must be done; but we are not fixing all the systems that need to be repaired at West Park including installing a sprinkler system, fixing the electrical wiring and upgrading technological capabilities in that building.</p>
<p><strong>What about the high school? </strong>We have applied for a grant and must either go to the voters to match the grant or go to the voters to pay for the urgent repairs at the high school.  The systems are fragile; hopefully they will continue to function!</p>

<p>The Dance 411 Foundation is an Atlanta-based nonprofit which exposes inner-city youth to quality arts education and performances. Originally founded in 2004 as the Journey Arts Program, Director Samara Michelle wanted to ensure all children have access to the transformative dance education she received at a local nonprofit dance school in Detroit as a child, regardless of their socio-economic standing.</p>
<p>In January 2012, Journey Arts partnered with Dance411 Studio owners Sindy and Ed Schneider to form the Dance 411 Foundation. With strong roots in the East Atlanta community, Dance 411 provided the perfect base to support a mission of fostering the well-being of urban youth and adults through self-expression by providing quality education and exposure to the art and discipline of dance, drama, &amp; music.</p>
<p><strong>What is our project?</strong></p>
<p>We are funding a new project: BRING ARTS BACK to School. This Campaign will provide Atlanta-area schools and community programs with both school supplies and arts education throughout the 2012-2013 academic school year. In order to pay the working artists and performers, the Dance 411 Foundation is raising $7500, which will cover our Artist Salaries. The planned recipients are Parkside Elementary ,The Kindezi School ,Dobbs Elementary, Dunbar Elementary ,Peyton Forest Elementary, CityCamp Program. More than 2500 children will be impacted by this initiative.</p>

<p><strong>Why is this a big deal?</strong></p>
<p>School budget cuts are at an all time high. A 2008, national survey follow-up analysis by the Center on Education Policy showed, in the five years after enactment of No Child Left Behind, that 16 percent of school districts had reduced elementary school class time for music and art. Artistic programs like dance, drama and music were labeled “Non-essentials” and were the first to go. But according to recent studies highlighting the benefits of arts education; formal arts instruction for children result in the following:</p>
<p>Pro-social behavior</p>
<p>Enhanced academic achievement</p>

<p><span>Picture your perfect language tutor: patient, understanding, knowledgeable, perfectly in tune with your needs, and available 24/7.  Now, where would you go to find such a tutor?  How much would you have to pay for a lesson?  Good luck with the unicorn search.  In the meantime, we’ve created LearnYu, an online computer tutor that can be all that and more.</span></p>
<p>Inspired by Khan Academy and Duolingo, LearnYu is an intelligent learning system that will automatically optimize your learning program.  As you learn, LearnYu will also learn about you.  It will dynamically generate exercises designed to reinforce your weak points, help you build your vocabulary and improve your conceptual understanding.  With a vast knowledge base and infinite patience and memory, LearnYu is like a superhero language tutor.</p>
<p>LearnYu's primary focus is spoken Mandarin Chinese. We are now crowdfunding the first level, where you will learn to understand and produce practical phrases -- introducing yourself, talking about your family, your likes and dislikes, the weather and all the juicy small talk. This level will prepare you to take the HSK 1 standardized test to prove your knowledge of Chinese.  We are also already planning the lessons for HSK 2. Besides the bragging right, an HSK certificate can also help you fulfill university requirements and land a better job.</p>

<p>But with your support, I’m confident that I will be able to focus all of my attention on LearnYu and recruit the outside help I need to really achieve the level of polish I want. We will be able to complete all of the above tasks and go public before April 2015. We will also start work on level 2, which corresponds to HSK 2.</p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Do I need to have Facebook in order to use LearnYu?</b></p>
<p>No. Facebook login is convenient because it's a single click, but we can give you a traditional password-based login as well. </p>
<b>Will you teach traditional characters as well?</b><p>Yes, by October we will support traditional characters. We already support simplified characters.</p>
<p><b>When will you have more levels?</b></p>
<p>If this campaign succeeds and we can forge ahead at full speed, we should be able to release a new level every 1-2 months. </p>
<p><b>What if this campaign doesn't reach its funding goal?</b></p>
<p>We will still be able to provide all the perks and we will still develop lessons for HSK 2 and beyond. Progress will just be slower than if we could hire Chinese teachers full-time.</p>
<p><b>Will you support more languages?</b></p>
<p><span>Creating this kind of site for Chinese or Japanese has vastly different requirements from creating this kind of site for languages written in the Latin alphabet. That's why </span><span><span>LearnYu will only do Chinese for the foreseeable future, though we have an agreement with the Esperanto Association of Britain to allow them to use our code to create a site teaching Esperanto. If we did do another language, it would be Japanese. But I'm a firm believer in doing one thing really well rather than trying to do everything in a mediocre way.</span></span><br/></p>
<p><b>Can my students use LearnYu?</b></p>
<p>Yes, contact us for class or school licenses. We will soon also have features for teachers to track their students' progress through the lessons and see the mistakes they make most often.</p>

<blockquote>LearnYu is a very intuitive course that takes you through one word at a time and with plenty of ways to get the pronunciation repeated, you also learn the tones quite effectively. What I found best with the way the course is built up is that you feel like you are playing a game where you are levelling up, little bars tell you how far you’ve come in the lesson and the greener they are the better you know each individual word.<br/>

<p> </p>
</div></div>","The campaign is over and rewards have been sent out. Go to www.learnyu.com for a demo lesson and write me at judith@learnlangs.com if you still want to purchase any of the perks. Prices may have changed.




Picture your perfect language tutor: patient, understanding, knowledgeable, perfectly in tune with your needs, and available 24/7.  Now, where would you go to find such a tutor?  How much would you have to pay for a lesson?  Good luck with the unicorn search.  In the meantime, we’ve created LearnYu, an online computer tutor that can be all that and more.
Inspired by Khan Academy and Duolingo, LearnYu is an intelligent learning system that will automatically optimize your learning program.  As you learn, LearnYu will also learn about you.  It will dynamically generate exercises designed to reinforce your weak points, help you build your vocabulary and improve your conceptual understanding.  With a vast knowledge base and infinite patience and memory, LearnYu is like a superhero language tutor.
LearnYu's primary focus is spoken Mandarin Chinese. We are now crowdfunding the first level, where you will learn to understand and produce practical phrases -- introducing yourself, talking about your family, your likes and dislikes, the weather and all the juicy small talk. This level will prepare you to take the HSK 1 standardized test to prove your knowledge of Chinese.  We are also already planning the lessons for HSK 2. Besides the bragging right, an HSK certificate can also help you fulfill university requirements and land a better job.




 






LearnYu is already live and usable, but with limited content. You can already study lessons and review them by reading short passages in Chinese and having conversations with the computer.  Try it for yourself! (Lesson 1 is publicly available, further lessons are only for people supporting this campaign at this point.)

(see the Gallery for more pictures)
Development of Level 1 is 50% complete and includes more than 1000 audio recordings (real voices, no machines!). We’ve already recruited more than 100 beta testers, who keep giving us valuable feedback. 
Your contribution will allow us to complete the work so that we can open the site to the general public. Here are some of the things we will use the money for:


Finish writing the remaining lessons of the first level


Record audio for new vocabulary and sentences, and edit them for lessons


Hire a web designer to ensure LearnYu looks good across different platforms	


Design more user & AI conversations


Add dictionary look-up

Support optional lessons based on user interests


Improve matching algorithm


Allow fuzzy word recognition for simple typos


Rework parts of the design


Fix various bugs as they get reported



Over the past year, I have devoted a lot of my personal funds and thousands of hours of sweat and toil to get the system to where it is now.  I’ve managed to build it up to the point where I can show people how this approach can work.  But we still have a way to go to build the learning platform that we envision.  I want to continue to push LearnYu ahead, but I cannot do this without your support.
But with your support, I’m confident that I will be able to focus all of my attention on LearnYu and recruit the outside help I need to really achieve the level of polish I want. We will be able to complete all of the above tasks and go public before April 2015. We will also start work on level 2, which corresponds to HSK 2.



Do I need to have Facebook in order to use LearnYu?
No. Facebook login is convenient because it's a single click, but we can give you a traditional password-based login as well. 
Will you teach traditional characters as well?Yes, by October we will support traditional characters. We already support simplified characters.
When will you have more levels?
If this campaign succeeds and we can forge ahead at full speed, we should be able to release a new level every 1-2 months. 
What if this campaign doesn't reach its funding goal?
We will still be able to provide all the perks and we will still develop lessons for HSK 2 and beyond. Progress will just be slower than if we could hire Chinese teachers full-time.
Will you support more languages?
Creating this kind of site for Chinese or Japanese has vastly different requirements from creating this kind of site for languages written in the Latin alphabet. That's why LearnYu will only do Chinese for the foreseeable future, though we have an agreement with the Esperanto Association of Britain to allow them to use our code to create a site teaching Esperanto. If we did do another language, it would be Japanese. But I'm a firm believer in doing one thing really well rather than trying to do everything in a mediocre way.
Can my students use LearnYu?
Yes, contact us for class or school licenses. We will soon also have features for teachers to track their students' progress through the lessons and see the mistakes they make most often.






LearnYu is a very intuitive course that takes you through one word at a time and with plenty of ways to get the pronunciation repeated, you also learn the tones quite effectively. What I found best with the way the course is built up is that you feel like you are playing a game where you are levelling up, little bars tell you how far you’ve come in the lesson and the greener they are the better you know each individual word.

I even met a Chinese guy in the bar and he was able to understand my basic: “I am Danish”  that’s a huge win.-- Chris Broholm, actualfluency.com

I really recommend you invest in LearnYu if you're a beginner in Chinese. Already, the tool is great to prepare you for HSK 1.  With plans to add more levels and new features, it'll be unstoppable.-- Olly Guest, chinesemusings.com

<p>I nostri studenti, di
Colleferro e dei paesi limitrofi, in questi anni hanno potuto
collaborare con scuole e studenti di tanti paesi europei e asiatici,
un’esperienza culturale e umana davvero grandiosa,  che è
possibile realizzare solo con progetti che prevedono uno scambio

contributo di tutti. Tutto questo fa decollare la motivazione degli
studenti sia nell’approfondimento del tema che nell’apprendimento
della lingua inglese che rende possibile il contatto e la
collaborazione. I computer, internet, le piattaforme su cui
lavoriamo, le classi virtuali che costruiamo sono gli strumenti che
rendono possibile la nostra apertura al mondo, ma sempre a servizio
di una valida e consapevole mediazione didattica. Siamo stati

Come potete contribuire e cosa vi possiamo offrire

 
Tutti gli scambi culturali sono basati sull'ospitalità delle famiglie proprio per determinare il maggior impatto culturale possibile. L'esperienza ci ha infatti dimostrato che vivere nelle famiglie e nelle scuole dei propri partner fornisce allo scambio un valore culturale ed educativo eccezionale, che elimina ogni preconcetto: nascono veri rapporti, amicizie che, più di ogni altro insegnamento formale a scuola, cambiano la mentalità dei ragazzi. Come già positivamente sperimentato negli anni precedenti i criteri per la scelta degli studenti italiani che visitano le scuole partner all’estero sono i seguenti: motivazione, impegno nell'International Club, competenza linguistica, interesse personale.
Nel 2015 continueranno gli scambi culturali con  il Millennia Institute di Singapore (http://www.millenniainstitute.moe.edu.sg/ ). Il preside di Singapore, visti i risultati estremamente positivi della collaborazione iniziata nel 2008 con progetti online e 3 anni di visite nelle rispettive scuole, ha proposto all’ITIS Cannizzaro di continuare per ulteriori tre anni le nostre attività comuni.
Spesa prevista per tutte le attività internazionali per l'anno scolastico 2014/2015 è di circa € 9000.
Contribuite per costruire un pezzettino di questa cifra, insieme alla scuola, le famiglie, il lavoro dell'International Club, gli sponsor privati e gli enti locali.
Se riusciremo a raccogliere di più, potremo invitare almeno un'altra scuola da un altro paese asiatico ed iniziare un altro scambio che si potrà concludere il prossimo anno scolastico!
In cambio vi possiamo offrire un magnifico video reportage della nostra visita a Singapore, non dimenticate che frequenteremo la scuola dei nostri amici e abiteremo nelle loro famiglie. La nostra prospettiva è del tutto particolare, non saremo turisti! Credeteci, sarà un video davvero interessante.
  L'impatto della comunità tutta sulla scuola 
Dal punto di vista economico, gli scambi vengono finanziati in parte dalle famiglie degli studenti, in parte da quanto ricavato dalle iniziative dell’International Club, in parte da contributi provenienti da sponsor privati, da Enti locali e dalla scuola.  
Ci piace molto l'idea che l'intera comunità che riconosce la validità delle nostre attività internazionali si impegna affinchè i ragazzi veramente motivati a partecipare agli scambi culturali possano prendervi parte, indipendentemente dalle loro possibilità economiche.
Le famiglie contribuiscono per circa la metà del costo del volo aereo, in modo tale che lo scambio culturale costi allo studente come un classico viaggio di istruzione.
Ovviamente le famiglie dei nostri studenti contribuiscono in modo totale quando ospitano gli studenti stranieri. L'esperienza di ospitare, in tutti gli scambi realizzati in questi anni, si è sempre dimostrata estremamente positiva dal punto di vista culturale e umano, non solo per gli studenti ma per l'intera famiglia ospitante.
  Rendiconto finale Alla fine dello scambio un rendiconto dettagliato dello scambio, inclusa la lista delle spese e delle entrate, sarà pubblicata sulla pagina Facebook dell'International Club dell'ITIS Stanislao Cannizzaro di Colleferro  https://www.facebook.com/groups/332328300144710/

<p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>We have been raising funds and
supporting the center for more than 10 years. This center is a non-profit
institution established in 1990 by the Sisterhood of Mary of Schoensttat. The center feeds and takes care of 100 children. Its
main purpose is to offer health, hygiene, education and nutritional services to
malnourished children (ages 0-5 years) of the impoverished community of La
Victoria, north of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>A couple of years back the sisters
shared with us the set backs the children would face on Christmas break (the
center closes for 2 weeks during Christmas). Most of the children’s families do
not have enough to eat. The children come back from break thinner and with their
immune system weakened. So we decided to focus on two important objectives,
providing a Christmas Nutritional Care Package for the children and their
family, and filling up the center’s Milk Bank for the upcoming year.</p>
<p>With your donations we will be helping 100
families have a happy Christmas!</p>

Hello, My name is David Sha. I'm reaching out to you today to help me accomplish something near and dear to my heart. Make no mistake, this is not about me, but an issue concerning the children in the neighborhood that I grew up in.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Pacific Pinball Museum, founded ten years ago, is a 501c3 non profit dedicated to preserving the art, science and history of pinball. The museum currently has  90 games set to free play for one admission price. Our museum is educational, interactive and fun.</p>
<p>It is also free! If you don't want to play you can visit our museum for free and learn all about pinball.  We are serously passionate about our mission.</p>
<p>We intend to see pinball preserved for future generations to learn from and play! Your contribution can help us ensure everyone still gets to play these original American masterpieces. You can help us get more than 1500 historic games to see the light of day again in a new, larger location -- potentially the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco.</p>
<p><img alt=""Palace of Fine Arts SF, CA"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/416268/pictures/original/20120831233020-Palace_of_Fine_Arts_004_edited-1.jpg?1346563311"" src="""" style="""" title=""PFA SF,CA""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>With your funding we will create exhibits about the history, science and art of pinball games from Pinball's birth as Bagatelle to the current day's Xmen and Tron.</p>
<p>Your help gets us to the next stage of this unparalleled effort.  America needs a pinball museum celebrating our uniquely American art form in a comprehensive and learned manner.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're looking for $1.5 million to help fund several aspects of our move. The nest egg we're building will help us negotiate terms with the city of San Francisco to  occupy a site there. We need to hire additional staff. There's moving costs and maintenance costs, plus we'll have to rent at least five big rigs to get everything over there. We plan to create new signage and exhibits for the big museum, apply for grants and continue our mural  and travelling exhibition programs.</p>
<p>In thanks, we'll hand you your very own PPE6 Poster, PPM logo T shirts and hats, a membership to the museum, passes to PPE6 (a $60 value) and lots more. Our angel donors will receive a lifetime membership to the museum allowing discounted access to themselves and a friend for the rest of their pinball-playing lives!</p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, your funding could still provide all these aspects in a different location in the Bay Area.  The Exploratorium's soon-to-be vacated site at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco is what we really want.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We already have 500 pinball games restored and ready to display at our nascent museum but there's no room in our current location to display them. We also have established the largest pinball show in the world: the Pacific Pinball Expo, now in its sixth year. This grass-roots effort is well on its way, our museum is fully self-sustaining in its current location, and reflects a herculean effort by more than 200 volunteers.</p>
<p>We've already seen great success with our ""History of Pinball"" exhibition at the San Francisco Airport Museum, our ""Pinball Oddity"" exhibition at Rhythmix Cultural Works of Alameda, CA and the ""Lil Juju"" portable pinball museum which goes to schools, the Maker Faire, and many other locations.</p>
<p>We've also used our pinball curriculum in classes for grade school children we held for the first time this year.</p>
<p>Pinball is global. People of all ages, backgrounds and walks of life instinctively know how to play pinball. This truly American art form has no equal in modern culture. America needs something to be proud of again, and pinball captures the engineering and artisitic ingenuity of our nation. Pinball brings together people of all backgrounds in a social setting outside the home.</p>
<p>Not only can you help us display our warehoused collection of more than 2,000 historic games, but your funding will help us develop our curriculum and offerings to students of all ages.</p>
<p>The timing is critical as the Golden Gate Parks and Rec will be putting out a Request For Proposals as soon as the Exploratorium has vacated the building in spring of 2013. If we can get a war chest together with our ready to go collection, we have a good chance at creating the most incredible museum of fun, learning and gaming in the world.</p>

</div></div>","At STAR Education, we believe that innovative enrichment should be available to all students, regardless of socioeconomic background. We've been pursuing this goal for over 27 years as an educational nonprofit operating primarily in Los Angeles, with offices San Diego, Sacramento, Nashville, and New York.Last year, we partnered with West LA College, LAUSD’s Beyond the Bell and LA County Office of Education to inspire 2,000 underserved students from across Los Angeles with exhibits, speakers, and activities designed to ignite their passion to explore a future in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math. Hosted at West LA College, it was an exciting and transformative event. We're hoping that, with your help, we’re able to make the event even more dynamic this year!   
S.T.E.A.M. Nation is a huge undertaking, as the event spans much of the West Los Angeles College campus for a day. Students from underserved communities from all over Los Angeles come to be inspired and excited by motivational shows, interactive exhibits, and hands-on activities. At the end of the day, students get to take home a bag filled with toys and games geared toward continuing the learning and exploring at home.
All of this is provided at no cost to the students who attend the event!
We're building on last year's successes, expanding the hours of the event, booking bigger presenters and sponsors, and providing lunch for students and volunteers. Needless to say, putting this together takes time, donated goods, volunteers, and a not-insignificant amount of money.
STAR Education is a nonprofit with over 27 years of experience and a reputation for excellence, so you can be confident that your support will go directly to improving this event for our deserving students. Last year, we were able to pull together the resources to make S.T.E.A.M. Nation happen with very little help, but this year we are hoping to strengthen our efforts with the support of our community! Every dollar you donate will help make the event more exciting and engaging for the students who need it most.
Everyone who pledges at least $5 will be included in a list of our supporters on the S.T.E.A.M. Nation website.
If unique swag is your thing, we're designing silicon bracelets, awesome NFC tags, and t-shirts so you can show your support offline as well. More details and images coming soon!
Those able to do more can be recognized as sponsors for sections of the event, with limited opportunities to get your organization's name on a booth or even on one of the four quadrants of the event.

Help spread opportunity and equal access to education by supporting S.T.E.A.M. Nation, and you'll be in the company of some big names who have already pledged their time and resources to making the event happen.

A range of unique perks are available to cater for all budgets, starting with our limited edition Mosquito Supporters Tee Shirt, through to the once in a lifetime opportunity to be on board the aircraft during a daily engine ground run.                       
Supporters T Shirt. 100% cotton (Only available through this campaign) 

Miracle of KA114 Short Film DVD



Your seat for the engine runs!




Please Note:  An average level of fitness and physical ability is required to climb the ladder and enter the cockpit.


 
Your Money is Safe!     Should we not reach our funding goal and the Mosquito does not attend Airventure 2015 you will have the opportunity to remain a supporter and receive the Tee shirt, or the Tee shirt + DVD. If you do not wish to receive these items, or if you have chosen the cockpit tour or engine run, then you will be refunded your contribution less the admin fee charged by Indiegogo of 9%.


How to redeem your Perk!   After paying for your Perk you will receive a confirmation email from Indiegogo confirming your contribution. Please print off that email and bring it with you to our tent situated next to the Mosquito. This email contains your unique Pledge ID  which will enable you to redeem your Perk.  



Risks 
 
The Mosquito is a complex aircraft and like all things mechanical, can occasionally become unserviceable.  In the unlikely event that some mechanical problem prevents the aircraft from attending the show then a refund will be offered just like if we fail to reach the funding goal as detailed above.   
 If the aircraft is late arriving then we will endeavor to fit everyone in for their tour or engine run, but if that is not possible then you too will be refunded.
Weather can also play a part in messing up our arrangements and if this happens, then the remedies offered for mechanical problems will similarly apply.

<p><b>Who Are we?</b></p>
<p><span>The last few months have been extremely exhilarating with introduction of robotics in our high school, St Mary's. This wonderful experience has truly widened our horizons in all aspects. Robotics has helped us take learning beyond the realm of our classroom and mundane textbooks. None of us ever imagined how exciting Science and mathematics could actually be!</span></p>
<p>Until we joined robotics, “united we stand, divided we fall” was just a trite saying that was inscribed within our minds. However, this experience taught us its true meaning. As a team we had several highs and lows; but we rose above these challenges and developed friendships that will last a lifetime. One Important lesson that we have learnt is that there is no problem that we can’t solve if we are determined; Be it a missing screw or a huge ego battle! We’ve learnt to understand matters in depth even if it may entail long debates, like the one we had on the difference between speed and velocity! Meeting deadlines, efficient division of tasks, working under pressure and team management are some of the many skills that will take us a long way.</p>
<p>Working along with three other teams, we have realised the impact that “gracious professionalism” has in general. Treating everyone with respect and promoting healthy competition has created a positive environment that favours our ultimate goal of learning. </p>
<p>We have realised that building a robot was just a minor part of our journey; The real experience has been the prodigious learning that will be a part of our lives forever. </p>
<p>And finally we have learnt that life like our programs has immense possibilities with each stage full of syntax errors; We just have to push ourselves and conquer them all!</p>
<br/> </div> <div> <h3>What we have achieved and why we need funds.</h3> <p>After a wonderful experience at the regionals we went to Delhi for the FTC Nationals. At the nationals we  won the Third place <b>Inspire Award</b> for our overall excellence, the <b>PTC Design Award</b> for our robust robot design and the <b>Motivate Award </b>for our undying enthusiasm. And now we are all pumped up to go to Sydney for the <b>Asia Pacific Invitational 2015</b>. We are all set to win it. However, such an endeavour will definitely require a considerable amount of monetary input; To be exact, it is around ten lakh forty thousand rupees. We would love if you could help us realise our dream and fund us 8 innovators in our journey. Even a small amount would help!</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>How will you help us?</h3> <p>This competition, organised by the multinational non profit organisation FIRST, is a road that we have never traveled. It all seems so surreal. We truly are representing our country on a worldwide scale event. The different people we will meet, the virtues that we will imbibe, the knowledge that we will gain, will all help  us develop as better individuals. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity, and we really do not want to lose it. It's an open door that we cannot afford to miss!</p>

</div><p></p><h3></h3><p>Hello! </p>
<p>We, from
Chaild, are four motivated students of the Nyenrode New Business School. In
November we went to India and saw a lot of beautiful, but sadly also a lot of
heart breaking things. We saw both children who were very happy and enjoyed
education, but we also saw children who stood on the side of the highway
begging for money.</p>
<p>This
project is to get the kids away from the dangerous highway and get them in the
schoolbanks. </p>
<p>I guess
that at this moment you are thinking: How are those four students in the
Netherlands help the poorest children in India? Well, when we were in India we
also met The Round Table of India. They have a program called Freedom Trough
Education, where they build schools and improve existing schools so every child
has the opportunity to get educated. </p>
<p>We will
give the money that we raise to The Round Table and they will make sure it goes
to the places where they need it the most.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To raise
money we thought it was a good idea to sell something that comes from India;
tea, or as they call it in India, Chai. The tea is of course fairtrade and no
children labor is used in the production of this tea. </p>
<p></p>
<p>We sell
packages of tea, which are nice as a gift or just for your own use, but also do
we sell an one year subscribtion for the real tea-lovers. With the subscription
you will receive 12 months long every month some tea.</p>
<p>Awareness
is really important in order to help as much children as possible. To draw as
much attention as possible we would like to ask if you could share our story and
our product as much as possible.</p><p>For contact, please send an email to chaildnnbs@gmail.com</p>

The money raised will buy me time away from teaching in order to design and implement creativity workshops for individuals, organizations, and businesses.
 
I am an award-winning teacher who wants to take what I’ve learned about creativity and apply it beyond the classroom. 

 I’ve taught at UW-Richland since 1992, typically four full courses a semester. 

 I’m a writer who has published poetry (in journals like Prairie Schooner and the Antioch Review) as well as fiction, creative nonfiction, and craft articles (in the Writer’s Chronicle). 

 But I’ve also been studying creativity as a scholar, particularly in the respected Wisconsin Teaching Fellow and Teaching Scholar programs. I’ve presented my findings at state and international conferences. 

You can read more about me and my creativity research on my blog, at http://marniere.wordpress.com/ (You can also contact me through the blog.)
 
Creativity can impact us in so many ways. Everything from “what’s for dinner?” to “how can politicians work together” can benefit from a creative approach. 
 
It’s not about being artistic—it’s about using what research shows us about the stages of creativity, how successful creativity comes about, how to measure it, and how to increase it.
 
I almost called this ""the Wisconsin Idea Mill"" because what I'm trying to do really does embody the Wisconsin Idea--the notion that the borders of the university are the borders of the state (and beyond).

 The goal for Marnie’s Idea Mill on Indiegogo is $4,000, but I’m hoping to exceed that goal. 

 I will be seeking the remainder of the funds from individuals and businesses.

 I am working with the Richland County Campus Foundation—they are collecting the funds, and if I reach the $24,000 goal by July 1, my time away from teaching will be an official UW System Sabbatical.  If  I don’t reach the full $24,000, I will negotiate time away from teaching a course at a time for Fall 2013.  Any funds raised in excess of $24,000 will be donated to the Richland County Campus Foundation, to be used for student scholarships or faculty/staff professional development.

NOTE: Funds can be sent directly to the Richland County Campus Foundation between June 17 and July 1, at UW-Richland.

through the death of a baby have described it as a silent loss saying, “Not
everyone can hear your pain"" and “You
need to be recognized as a parent, but where do you go to get that recognition
when no one knew your baby?”
<span><span><span><a href=""#_ftn1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[1]</a></span></span></span> Scrapbooking is an avenue toward helping parents heal and helping communities, including family
members, friends, and healthcare providers, understand child loss.</p>
<p>The Scraps of the Heart Project is a partnership between  Erin Willer along with her students in the <a href=""http://www.du.edu/ahss/schools/comn/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Department of Communication Studies</a> at the <a href=""http://www.du.edu/ccesl/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">University of Denver</a> and <a href=""http://www.coloradopregnancyloss.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Colorado Pregnancy and Newborn Loss Services (CPNL)</a>. CPNL is a 501(c)(3) non-profit
community-based organization whose mission is “healing parents to promote
healthy families” following the loss of a child. Together we are building a
program to begin in Fall 2014 that will provide scrapbooking workshops to bereaved parents. Creating
scrapbooks is a way for parents to memorialize, celebrate, and share their
babies. Parents in our program also will be invited to display their
scrapbooks publically if they choose at venues such as CPNL's annual wine and chocolate benefit. This community expression of grief has
the potential to offer education to those who lack understanding of the pain of child loss and healing to those who know such sorrow all too well.</p>
<p><b></b></p><p><b><b>Where Did This Idea Come From?</b></b></p><p>Erin Willer is the mother to Matilda Plum and her twin angel brother Milo Juniper, who died on February 8, 2013 when he was three hours old. Erin also experienced two miscarriages before giving birth to Matilda and Milo; these angels are Our Baby (O.B.) and Baby Willer (B.W.). Although Erin had never scrapbooked before, after she and her husband Mark lost O.B., she had a strong desire to capture her memories. The scrapbook not only became what she and Mark had instead of their baby, but it also became a way to help others understand their grief and the significance of O.B.’s life. As a professor of interpersonal and family communication at the University of Denver who studies infant loss, Erin joined with Dorotha Cicchinelli, the Executive Director of CPNL, in order to support bereaved parents through scrapbooking. Erin and her students will bring their research skills to the project in order to study the scrapbooking process and further educate community and academic audiences about infant loss. In short, the Scraps of the Heart Project is a gift from O.B., B.W., and Milo Willer. Erin and Mark thank you in advance for helping their babies give it.   </p><b>What Your
Contributions Will Help Us Do</b><p></p>
<p>Our goal is to provide scrapbooking materials to at least 50 families. The cost of the materials for one scrapbook is approximately $100. Part of a Public Good Fund research grant from the University of Denver's <a href=""http://www.du.edu/ccesl/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Center for Community Engagement and Service Learning</a> is helping us purchase supplies for 20 families.  Therefore, our
campaign goal is to raise enough money to provide materials for at least 30 more families. All funds we
raise up to our funding goal will help us provide parents with scrapbook supplies
(e.g., scrapbook, stickers, paper) for the workshops. If we go over our funding
goal, we will purchase scrapbook supplies for additional families and other items for the project, including supplies for
exhibiting the scrapbooks (e.g. bookstands) and promotion materials for the
exhibits (e.g., flyers, invitations).</p>

Healing Hearts

En su catálogo alberga más de 10000 </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">obras entre literatura, poesía o cómic escritos casi en su totalidad por mujeres; ensayos sobre </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">feminismo, sexualidad, salud o maternidad; y libros infantiles no sexistas, realizando una </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">importante labor de visibilizar a mujeres escritoras, filósofas, poetas.</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">En el año 2009 Relatoras inauguró su sede física en Sevilla, donde, además de libros, </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">ofrecemos distintas actividades: presentaciones de libros, charlas, conferencias, talleres, </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">exposiciones.</span></p>
<p><b>La escuela</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">La escuela de Relatoras se divide en dos partes. Por un lado está la Escuela de Escritoras <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Helvéticas, en la que se imparten los talleres de escritura creativa, autobiográfica y </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">terapéutica. Por el otro, el Campus Relatoras, cuyos talleres son de temática más variada: </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">fotografía, deconstrucción del amor romántico, maternidades, coaching, etc.</span></p>
<p>• <b>Helvéticas</b></p>

</div></div>","Para cambiar tu vida necesitas tener las herramientas apropiadas. En la escuela de Relatoras las hemos creado y queremos abrir un Fondo de Becas para que puedan acceder a ellas todas las mujeres que las necesiten. ¿Nos ayudas?When you`re up to change your life, you need to have the right tools. In Relatoras school we´ve created them and we want to fund scholarships and make theese tools available to all the women in the world. ¿Will you help us to achieve it?(Whole text in english here)(Fond de bourses de Relatoras en français ici)¿Qué es Relatoras?Relatoras es un proyecto destinado a las mujeres. Aunque nuestra sede está en Sevilla, España, la parte más importante de nuestra labor es virtual e involucra a personas de todo el planeta. Nuestro trabajo se desarrolla en dos proyectos independientes. Por una parte, una librería física en Sevilla y una librería de mujeres online. Por la otra, nuestra plataforma de aprendizaje, formada por Helvéticas Escuela de Escritoras en la que impartimos talleres presenciales y ONLINE de escritura autobiográfica, creativa y terapéutica; y el Campus Relatoras, donde ofrecemos cursos de diversas temáticas (fotografía, psicología, et.), también presenciales y ONLINE, que acompañan a las mujeres hacia el empoderamiento. En los siete años que llevamos con el proyecto, han pasado por Relatoras más de 700 alumnas de todo el mundo, de entre 20 y 70 años. Casi la mitad de nuestras alumnas proceden de América del Sur.Sin embargo, cada día nos llegan cartas y llamadas de mujeres en situaciones económicas complicadas que no pueden pagar el precio, ya ajustado, de los talleres. Al ser un proyecto autogestionado e independiente, podemos hacer pocas excepciones. Por eso necesitamos tu ayuda para crear un Fondo de Becas y hacer que muchas más mujeres puedan acceder a nuestros cursos.
Ahora te estarás preguntando: ¿Por qué Relatoras? ¿Por qué nuestra escuela?
Porque es diferente. Todos nuestros talleres y cursos están enfocados al trabajo autobiográfico e interior de cada alumna, a la vez que propician la reflexión colectiva en torno a los estereotipos y las vivencias de las mujeres de nuestro tiempo. En todos los talleres, las alumnas exploran sus emociones, revalorizan su propia vida y sus experiencias como fuente de sabiduría e inspiración y reciben herramientas concretas con las que dinamizar el cambio que quieren ver en sus vidas. 
Nuestro taller ONLINE más exitoso, sin duda, es el “Señoras que… dejan de sufrir por amor”, coordinado por la antropóloga Coral Herrera Gómez, que ya va por su tercera edición. 
En la comunidad de nuestra escuela hemos podido observar cómo se transformaban algunas alumnas después de realizar un taller: hemos visto a mujeres que se atrevían a publicar sus obras después de haberlas escondido toda su vida; mujeres mayores que ingresaban por primera vez en la universidad; incluso mujeres que llegaban a denunciar situaciones de maltrato o abusos o un caso muy especial de una alumna se logró quedarse embarazada después de hacer un taller sobre la maternidad… pero, sobre todo, mujeres que dicen haber encontrado un lugar de pertenencia en el que son libres de ser ellas mismas.




¿Qué necesitamos?


Relatoras es un proyecto joven y autogestionado y tenemos que hacer malabares para poder pagar dignamente a las coordinadoras de los talleres, las facturas, los impuestos… Desde que comenzara la crisis económica en 2008, hemos reducido nuestras tarifas casi un 15% y hemos creado descuentos especiales para personas desempleadas. Pero aun así, hay muchas mujeres que no pueden pagarlos.

Con el Fondo de Becas podremos ofrecer descuentos de 80 % a las mujeres desempleadas. Cada beca estará destinada a pagarle a la profesora del taller (50 % del precio): Relatoras renunciará a su porcentaje (30 %) y la alumna pagará los gastos técnicos del taller (20 %). También crearemos descuentos especiales (de hasta 50%) para trabajadoras precarias.
(Las becas se otorgarán por orden de solicitud, siendo necesario demostrar la situación de desempleo. Las plazas becadas no superarán el 30% del total de las plazas ofertadas en cada taller)
También necesitamos difundir esta campaña y llegar a oídos de personas con posibilidad de ayudarnos. Comparte esta iniciativa en las redes sociales o reenvíala a todas tus amistades vía email. Si tienes una web o blog, puedes poner allí el logo de nuestra campaña y darle así más visibilidad.

¿Qué ofrecemos a cambio?

A cambio, te ofrecemos lo mejor que tenemos: nuestros talleres y nuestros libros. Hemos creado diferentes descuentos según la cuantía de dinero donado (las puedes ver en la columna de la derecha). Si no hablas español, no es un problema: en otoño de 2014 haremos una edición especial de un taller en inglés (¡no te olvides de indicarlo¡). 
Si no te apetece realizar ningún taller, también tenemos pegatinas, cuadernos y fantásticas bolsas con el dibujo de nuestra campaña. 




Si donas más de 500 € ¡te regalamos un taller, el que quieras y en la edición que prefieras! Y para aquellas organizaciones o personas que donen 1000 o 2000 euros, les obsequiaremos con un TALLER EXCLUSIVO, para 5 y 10 personas respectivamente, a elegir entre “Señoras que… dejan de sufrir por amor” y “Revelaciones de un mundo”. 

¡Imagínate poder hacer un taller con tus amigas, o regalarlo a las socias de tu fundación! Los talleres tendrán una duración de 4 semanas y están valorados en 90 €/persona. Además, tu organización aparecerá como patrocinadora de nuestra escuela el tiempo que duren los talleres becados. 



Nuestro proyecto de cerca.
La librería
Relatoras nació como librería virtual y hoy en día se ha convertido en la librería de mujeres online de referencia en el mundo de habla hispana. En su catálogo alberga más de 10000 obras entre literatura, poesía o cómic escritos casi en su totalidad por mujeres; ensayos sobre feminismo, sexualidad, salud o maternidad; y libros infantiles no sexistas, realizando una importante labor de visibilizar a mujeres escritoras, filósofas, poetas.En el año 2009 Relatoras inauguró su sede física en Sevilla, donde, además de libros, ofrecemos distintas actividades: presentaciones de libros, charlas, conferencias, talleres, exposiciones.
La escuela
La escuela de Relatoras se divide en dos partes. Por un lado está la Escuela de Escritoras Helvéticas, en la que se imparten los talleres de escritura creativa, autobiográfica y terapéutica. Por el otro, el Campus Relatoras, cuyos talleres son de temática más variada: fotografía, deconstrucción del amor romántico, maternidades, coaching, etc.
• Helvéticas
Helvéticas es una escuela para mujeres entre siglos, entre estereotipos, entre roles, entre lo público y lo privado, entre lo íntimo y lo político, entre lo individual y lo grupal. Mujeres por inventarse a través de la invención. Mujeres que a través del disfrute del conocimiento, alteran la visión de su realidad y la recrean, aportando así nuevas formas de vivir, de mirar, de contar y de escribir el mundo. La nueva apuesta de Helvéticas es “Viaje al centro del Deseo”, un taller de escritura terapéutica, coordinado por la escritora Raquel Campuzano y la terapeuta Nuria Guerra. Más información aquí: http://www.escuelahelveticas.com/page/somos-1
• Campus Relatoras 
Es la iniciativa más joven de Relatoras. Queríamos abrir nuestra escuela a mujeres que no estaban interesadas en la escritura. En el Campus ofrecemos talleres tanto presenciales (en Sevilla y en Madrid) como online, con una amplia variedad temática: fotografía, dinámicas psicológicas de las mujeres, coaching etc. El taller más exitoso, sin duda, es el “Señoras que… dejan de sufrir por amor”, coordinado por la antropóloga Coral Herrera Gómez. El curso va por su tercera edición online y se ha creado un laboratorio permanente con las más de 100 alumnas que ya lo han realizado o están haciéndolo ahora mismo. Nuestro objetivo es crear una amplia red de mujeres que reflexionen, dialoguen, se autocritiquen acerca del amor romántico patriarcal e inventen entre todas nuevas formas de querer(se) más sanas, igualitarias y placenteras.Entre los proyectos futuros podemos destacar un taller sobre maternidades, uno sobre violencia machista (coordinado por una autora feminista de renombre en España) y la puesta en marcha de un proyecto de coaching con perspectiva de género.

<h3>Campaign Summary</h3>
<p>Victims of domestic violence often turn to religious leaders for help. Families in immigrant communities especially turn to their faith leaders, as they fear that an official report of domestic violence might jeopardize immigration status for the entire family. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, few faith leaders are equipped to counsel their congregations about domestic violence, and even contribute to the culture of silence about the issue by not addressing it in worship services. </p>
<p>For over 2 years, the Interfaith Center of New York and CONNECT NYC have been conducting professional trainings for religious leaders, to give them the skills they need to bring help to their communities, and provide victims with resources they can use to regain their safety, health and happiness.  We want to continue this important work, but can't manage to sustain the program without help.  </p>
<p>All donations to this campaign are fully tax deductible, and all money raised (even should we exceed our target amount) will be used to conduct training classes for religious leaders, and counsel them as they launch DV support projects in their respective communities.  Our goal of $5,000 would enable us to continue this valuable mission, and through the work of faith leaders around New York City, extend a hand of trust, safety and guidance to victims of domestic violence.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">Over 15% of persons under 25 years of age are on the live register. This lack of education, disparity of access and high levels of youth unemployment is one of the major social issues in Ireland today.

Thank you for visiting our page. 
Our PayPal issues have now been resolved. 
We are ready and waiting to process your contributions.
 
 
Thanks so much from all here on the FirstWorks Team!
 
 
The Situation...
Over 15% of persons under 25 years of age are on the live register. This lack of education, disparity of access and high levels of youth unemployment is one of the major social issues in Ireland today. Yet companies in Ireland source approximately 55% of their high level ICT skills from inward migration and there is an ongoing vacancy rate of 4-5% for ICT skills.
Our Solution...
Through intensive, targeted training programmes in IT, financial services and other critical skills that today’s employers are looking for. Along with extensive, meaningful internships in top companies, the First Works programme will provide a new outlook for students, exposing them to a culture of success that inspires them to maximise their full potential. Equally, companies will benefit from talented, diverse, determined young people that they wouldn’t otherwise find.
The Impact...
In Ireland we have built a team of three dedicated and passionate professionals - Mary, David and Siobhan. We have also partnered with Dublin City University to provide the unique First Works training programme. First Works is modelled on Genesys Works (http://www.genesysworks.org/), an American organisation that has already demonstrated the success of such an approach for both students and companies. Participation in the First Works programme will allow young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to reach their full potential.

The Roll-Out...
To launch the pilot of the First Works programme, we need to raise a seed fund of €18,000. This funding will be used to support the development of the programme content/materials and oversee the roll-out of the pilot. Once we meet our funding goal, the pilot will launch this September with 25 students from the Donahies Community School in Donaghmede, Co.Dublin.

The Result...
A student's future should not be defined or limit by their background. By supporting this campaign you have a unique opportunity to give others the chance to redefine their futures and change the trajectory of their lives. If you can not support First Works financially, please spread the word about our campaign and keep up to date with us on Facebook and Twitter!

<h4>Why Study, Teach, Learn, and Sing Francis Scott Key's Anthem?</h4>
<p>I believe that ""The Star Spangled Banner"" is so well known as to be surprisingly unknown. Very few know the song's real history. Yet, the story of Francis Scott Key's anthem and the ways that Americans have used it to express their feelings about our nation offer a unique educational opportunity not only to celebrate Key's lyric, but to consider the meaning of citizenship today. The story of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" is the story of America — with all its stars, stripes, strife, and triumphs — and with your help, we can get students from kindergarten through high school across the nation to celebrate, sing, and think about the Banner and help celebrate the song's upcoming bicentennial.</p>

<h3>Project Impact</h3>
<p>Publishing the <i>Poets &amp; Patriots</i> recordings and the <i>Star Spangled Songbook</i> will realize a dream I've been pursuing in my teaching and research for over a decade, yet my devotion to this project appeals to bigger goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>To share the amazing story of ""The Star Spangled Banner"" with every K-12 student in the United States.</li>
<li>To build a coalition of informed teachers excited about teaching the anthem.</li>
<li>To correct misinformation about the Banner—for example, the tale that someone other than Francis Scott Key connected text and tune. In fact, Key knew ""The Anacreontic Song"" well and had used it for patriotic poetry before, notably a song titled ""When the Warrior Returns,"" which we've recorded for the CD.</li>
<li>To show how the art of music and the creativity of Americans has helped us navigate crisis and imagine ourselves as a nation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Our Success So Far</h3>
<p>We are not seeking funds to make the recordings or to do the basic research to identify and edit the musical scores. This work has already been paid for by grants from the University of Michigan's Office for the Vice President for Research, Humanities Institute, and its School of Music, Theatre &amp; Dance, as well as a Sight and Sound subvention from the Society for American Music. However, these grants cannot be used for publication or distribution expenses—which is why we need your help.</p>
<p>We are especially excited that the National Endowment for the Humanities has funded the U-M American Music Institute's summer teacher training program ""<a href=""http://starspangledmusic.org/?p=240"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Banner Moments</a>."" It will feature a performance — including our scores — by baritone and art song scholar <a href=""http://www.thomashampson.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Thomas Hampson</a> at the U.S. Library of Congress! With your help, each of the thirty teachers participating in the institute will receive both the CDs and the Songbook.</p>
<h3>Our Stretch Goals...</h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">If we exceed our initial goal of $11,700 (and I'm keeping my fingers crossed for good luck), we will use any extra funds to develop further educational materials, videos, and curriculum guides to be distributed for free on our website. Additional funds will help spread the word to teachers nationwide through educational publications and advertising. In fact, we have so many more ideas and programs, some already underway and some awaiting fundraising, that our success here will inspire us to be even more ambitious. See, for example, our <a href=""http://starspangledmusic.org/?page_id=35"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Star Spangled Stories Contest</a> and the National <a href=""http://starspangledmusic.org/?p=215"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Star-Spangled Music Day</a> planned for September 12, 2014. We will put your donation to good use. </span></p>

If we exceed our initial goal of $11,700 (and I'm keeping my fingers crossed for good luck), we will use any extra funds to develop further educational materials, videos, and curriculum guides to be distributed for free on our website. Additional funds will help spread the word to teachers nationwide through educational publications and advertising. In fact, we have so many more ideas and programs, some already underway and some awaiting fundraising, that our success here will inspire us to be even more ambitious. See, for example, our Star Spangled Stories Contest and the National Star-Spangled Music Day planned for September 12, 2014. We will put your donation to good use. 
Other Ways You Can Help
Any donation helps our cause and helps build our coalition. Yet while we need money, there are many ways you can put your excitement about our anthem anniversary project into action:


Shout about our campaign on your Facebook page, Twitter or other social media.

Like our Facebook page, follow us on Twitter, and sign up for email updates.


Tell a teacher about our plans—share links to the educational materials we've already created for our website and YouTube channel. Tell them to join our national Star Spangled Teachers Network for more information. 
If you're interested in volunteering for the Star Spangled Music Foundation to share your skills and contacts to advance these projects, please email info@starspanglemusic.org.


The Star Spangled Music Foundation
SSMF is a federally recognized U.S. 501(c)(3) non-profit organization formed to spark a national celebration of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" bicentennial in September 2014 with a continuing mission to provide materials on American song to teachers for the benefit of K-12 and college students across the nation. The foundation is led by two music historians—board chair Mark Clague and executive director Susan Key. For more information, see http://www.starspangledmusic.org

						Behind this sexy mustache, lies a dream: To become an entrepreneur who'll change the world. After starting his BT in System Analysis, Alexandre developed an enormous passion for programming. However, he soon realized that college wouldn't be enough, so, he started to pursue knowledge, and discovered an enthusiastic learner inside himself. Alexandre started to go deeper into his interests and soon college became boring to him. However, one subject got his attention: Entrepreneurship. With an amazing instructor, Alexandre started to study about Entrepreneurship and couldn't avoid to became more excited as he entered the entrepreneurial world. All sounded beautiful theoretically, but in the real world, it's not that easy. Despite the fact he had an amazing instructor, Alexandre realized that the knowledge about entrepreneurship learned in college was at all, superficial. He knew that to become a good entrepreneur, he'd need more than that. He'd need to be immersed in an amazing environment, supported by an amazing community sharing the same passion and eager to help each other become better entrepreneurs. Based on that, he started his search and soon, Alexandre ran into <a href=""http://exosphe.re/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://exosphe.re/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Exosphere</a>.

						On March 29, 2012, American entrepreneur Skinner Layne posted his 27 Theses of Education Reform to the Internet, distilling his years of thinking about the problems with contemporary education, entrepreneurship, and the needed reforms. He envisioned remaking the University into a place of open inquiry, curiosity, customized learning, entrepreneurial exploration, and community-building. Unsatisfied with the purely technological solutions to the problems with education, Skinner argued that we must preserve the human elements of learning, interaction with other people, and the exchange of ideas in person as well as online--fusing technology and physical-world experience into a seamless and unified whole. This was the beginning of Exosphere. He was Antonio Manno, an experienced Italian entrepreneur and soon after by Carlos Miceli, an Argentinian wunderkind who had personally experienced the pains of the traditional educational system and had forged his own path in life. They were supported along the way by Skinner’s long-time close friend and business confidant, Andy Ellwood, one of the leading business development experts and practitioners in the start-up world. Together the four of them tried several approaches to turn this vision into reality. On September 23, 2013 a diverse group of 27 people from 11 countries, and spanning in age from 19 to 57 arrived in Santiago for Exosphere’s first entrepreneurship boot camp. From this small beginning, the Exosphere team is setting a new course for the way we learn, work and live and are spreading this vision to the world.</p>

						In November 2013, Exosphere announced their upcoming Boot Camp for entrepreneurs, that'll happen from March to June 2014, this time, for 45 people.

<p>Hello!
Thank you for taking the time to check out my Campaign! </p>
<p>My name is Renzo
Rebuffo, and let me introduce you to my new start-up called SpillOut.
 SpillOut is an app specifically designed to help ease any student’s
collegiate life, by bringing the classroom to the palm of their hands. It is a
virtual study group, open 24 hours a day for the duration of a class or semester.
What makes this App unique is having the option of subscribing to a chat room
with all of your classmates that are taking the same course as you, without the
need of giving out any personal information. </p>
<p>This idea dawned on me
one day as I was sitting at home panicking about missing class due to a bad cold that kept me home for over a week.  I thought about emailing the
professor to see what I missed, when I remembered that on the syllabus, the
professor wrote in bold:</p>
<p>""MISSED CLASSES ARE
ON YOU! I WILL NOT REPLY TO EMAILS THAT ASK, ""WHAT DID I MISS?"" SO
TRY TO STAY HEALTHY"". </p>
<p>Great professor huh?? LOL... And being that I'm a little shy, I never got around to asking my
classmates for their numbers, or email addresses.. So in the end I read some
chapters, but was completely lost during the next few classes......... sound familiar?</p>
<p>This
is one of the reasons I decided to create SpillOut. </p>
<p>Now,
let's learn a little
more about it!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What
is SpillOut?</b></p>
<p>SpillOut is a social
networking app designed for college students, by a college student. It will
unite social networking and the classroom into one, allowing students to
connect with each other and discuss class work anytime of the day anywhere in
the world, through their Smartphone.  By allowing students to create
individual chat rooms for each of their courses, students will have the ability
to communicate with everyone in their class through their cell phone without
having to share personal information. </p>
<p>Imagine that! Having a
group chat for every class you are taking a semester! How convenient!</p>
<p>Students are no longer
held to communicating with the few sitting around them, because normally that is what happens. Studies show that most of the
time, students will only get to meet 4-5 students from each class. And generally,
these are the students who sit nearest you. Now, with SpillOut you can communicate
with every single person in that class room.</p>
<p>Think about it! </p>
<p>Study groups no longer
have to take place in the same room, with SpillOut, you can message your
classmates directly and discuss quizzes, homework, or readings from the comfort
of your home. SpillOut also helps you organize your school life by providing
you with dedicated features strictly made to alert you when homework,
assignments and quizzes take place or are due.

</p><p><u><span>The main features
include</span></u>:</p>
<ul><li>Class-Course Chat Rooms- A class chat room can be
     created by any student from any College or University. The teacher has no
     control over this chat room, meaning comments or posts are not monitored.
     The chat rooms are created easily by selecting simple criteria to identify
     your class like: school name, teacher, time, and course number. Then, once
     a classroom is made, any student in your class can easily search for the chat
     room by typing the criteria in the 'search for chat room page’ and
     register for the chat. When registered, a student will be able to message
     the entire class and everyone will see what topics are being discussed.  The best part about it is that, at the
     end of the semester every course automatically closes.</li></ul><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/692061/files/20140703083157-PRESENTACION_PROTOTYPO-_FIXES-9.jpg?1404401517"" src="""" style=""width: 599.6563876651983px; height: 463px;""/></p><br/><p></p><br/><ul>
<li>Classmate Book- Basically an address book. This
     feature allows you to see classmates which you have added to your
     personal contact list. These contacts may be classmates who you talk to
     constantly, or you consider a friend.</li>

<li>Direct Messaging: With this feature you are able to
     message the classmates you have added to your contact list, privately.
     Here you can hold conversations, transfer files to each other, and hold
     private study sessions with a single classmate.</li>
</ul><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/692070/files/20140703083449-PRESENTACION_PROTOTYPO-_FIXES-8.jpg?1404401689"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><br/><ul><li>Class Schedule: This feature works as a dedicated calendar
     for your school work. Here you can note quiz dates, homework' deadlines,
     and any reminders for school related activity.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/653502/files/20140616140854-PRESENTACION_PROTOTYPO11-12.jpg?1402952934"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""/>

to come once the App goes live. However, with these basic features, students
will have the means to talk directly with each other about that one specific
course they are taking that semester. </span></p>
<p><b>About myself, and what is my Goal?</b></p>
<p>To tell you a little
about myself, I am 25 years old and I am a student at Florida International
University (FIU). As a current student, I know the feeling of being on campus
having to go through the uncomfortable struggle of meeting new people every
semester for not just one course, but sometimes up to 4-6 at a time. Which is great, we students want to meet new people and make new connections. But there has to be a simpler way of connecting with everyone. Asking each and every person for their contact info is awkward at times, and sometimes makes you feel a little embarrassed.</p>
<p>My goal is to make an
application that allows you to connect with your classmates in a simpler way. And also, an application that makes communicating in school safer. An app that puts everyone together with just a few clicks.  </p><p></p><p><b>The Impact</b></p><p>To date, there is no App with these capabilities for students to interact with each other. This App will allow students to talk outside of class without constricting them to be someplace physically, like in a library or on campus. You will be able to discuss school work, while still being able to take care of your personal responsibilities. College students have been waiting for an application that facilitates academic communication and this will solve that problem. </p><p>I have learned that students want to help each other, and learn better by working together, but some students have demanding schedules: Some have families and children of their own, or like most of us, a job, and cannot make time to meet on campus for study groups. This App makes it much easier for students to connect. </p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Privacy</b></p><p>Don’t you wish you didn't have to give out your cell phone number and email address as often to people you do not know?

Hello!
Thank you for taking the time to check out my Campaign! 
My name is Renzo
Rebuffo, and let me introduce you to my new start-up called SpillOut.
 SpillOut is an app specifically designed to help ease any student’s
collegiate life, by bringing the classroom to the palm of their hands. It is a
virtual study group, open 24 hours a day for the duration of a class or semester.
What makes this App unique is having the option of subscribing to a chat room
with all of your classmates that are taking the same course as you, without the
need of giving out any personal information. 
This idea dawned on me
one day as I was sitting at home panicking about missing class due to a bad cold that kept me home for over a week.  I thought about emailing the
professor to see what I missed, when I remembered that on the syllabus, the
professor wrote in bold:
""MISSED CLASSES ARE
ON YOU! I WILL NOT REPLY TO EMAILS THAT ASK, ""WHAT DID I MISS?"" SO
TRY TO STAY HEALTHY"". 
Great professor huh?? LOL... And being that I'm a little shy, I never got around to asking my
classmates for their numbers, or email addresses.. So in the end I read some
chapters, but was completely lost during the next few classes......... sound familiar?
This
is one of the reasons I decided to create SpillOut. 
Now,
let's learn a little
more about it!



What
is SpillOut?
SpillOut is a social
networking app designed for college students, by a college student. It will
unite social networking and the classroom into one, allowing students to
connect with each other and discuss class work anytime of the day anywhere in
the world, through their Smartphone.  By allowing students to create
individual chat rooms for each of their courses, students will have the ability
to communicate with everyone in their class through their cell phone without
having to share personal information. 
Imagine that! Having a
group chat for every class you are taking a semester! How convenient!
Students are no longer
held to communicating with the few sitting around them, because normally that is what happens. Studies show that most of the
time, students will only get to meet 4-5 students from each class. And generally,
these are the students who sit nearest you. Now, with SpillOut you can communicate
with every single person in that class room.
Think about it! 
Study groups no longer
have to take place in the same room, with SpillOut, you can message your
classmates directly and discuss quizzes, homework, or readings from the comfort
of your home. SpillOut also helps you organize your school life by providing
you with dedicated features strictly made to alert you when homework,
assignments and quizzes take place or are due.

The main features
include:
Class-Course Chat Rooms- A class chat room can be
     created by any student from any College or University. The teacher has no
     control over this chat room, meaning comments or posts are not monitored.
     The chat rooms are created easily by selecting simple criteria to identify
     your class like: school name, teacher, time, and course number. Then, once
     a classroom is made, any student in your class can easily search for the chat
     room by typing the criteria in the 'search for chat room page’ and
     register for the chat. When registered, a student will be able to message
     the entire class and everyone will see what topics are being discussed.  The best part about it is that, at the
     end of the semester every course automatically closes.
Classmate Book- Basically an address book. This
     feature allows you to see classmates which you have added to your
     personal contact list. These contacts may be classmates who you talk to
     constantly, or you consider a friend.

Direct Messaging: With this feature you are able to
     message the classmates you have added to your contact list, privately.
     Here you can hold conversations, transfer files to each other, and hold
     private study sessions with a single classmate.
Class Schedule: This feature works as a dedicated calendar
     for your school work. Here you can note quiz dates, homework' deadlines,
     and any reminders for school related activity.
       Many more features are
to come once the App goes live. However, with these basic features, students
will have the means to talk directly with each other about that one specific
course they are taking that semester. 
About myself, and what is my Goal?
To tell you a little
about myself, I am 25 years old and I am a student at Florida International
University (FIU). As a current student, I know the feeling of being on campus
having to go through the uncomfortable struggle of meeting new people every
semester for not just one course, but sometimes up to 4-6 at a time. Which is great, we students want to meet new people and make new connections. But there has to be a simpler way of connecting with everyone. Asking each and every person for their contact info is awkward at times, and sometimes makes you feel a little embarrassed.
My goal is to make an
application that allows you to connect with your classmates in a simpler way. And also, an application that makes communicating in school safer. An app that puts everyone together with just a few clicks.  The ImpactTo date, there is no App with these capabilities for students to interact with each other. This App will allow students to talk outside of class without constricting them to be someplace physically, like in a library or on campus. You will be able to discuss school work, while still being able to take care of your personal responsibilities. College students have been waiting for an application that facilitates academic communication and this will solve that problem. I have learned that students want to help each other, and learn better by working together, but some students have demanding schedules: Some have families and children of their own, or like most of us, a job, and cannot make time to meet on campus for study groups. This App makes it much easier for students to connect. PrivacyDon’t you wish you didn't have to give out your cell phone number and email address as often to people you do not know? I feel the same way; however, it is the only way to effectively stay in touch with classmates. And from my point of view, as well as other students with whom I've discussed this with, agree that we shouldn't have to share personal information in order to stay connected in school. There ought to be another way! And SpillOut is the solution.Consider this:Students, imagine yourselves having a question about a topic you didn't understand in class, and being able to ask the entire classroom for their perspective.Forgot the pages to study for next week’s exam? Ask the classroom!Picture you are absent from class, and as soon as you know the class is over, you message your classmates to see what you've missed.Or think of this, you are stuck in traffic and need to communicate to the teacher that you are running late.  Now, you will have the option to message a classmate directly and have them tell the teacher for you, because honestly, if you email the teacher, they will not see the email until well after the class is over.The scenarios are endless and an app like this can definitely help us out!
Current Progress and Fundraising
As of today, I have
designed all of the Front-End wire framing for the app. I have mapped out the
app completely and I now need a developer to implement the app.  But
unfortunately, I do not have the sufficient funds to hire a professional
developer. This is an idea and concept that I have been brainstorming and
researching for many months and with your help will be launching by the end
2014.
I have not raised any
money from an individual or company. As a student and full time employee, I
have tried my best to put aside as much money as possible to start this
project. My main focus has been to get this app started as far as I could
without outside funds, but unfortunately, it will take me a couple of years to
gather the money I would need to launch this by myself. Together with your
generosity, I hope to get the
app off the ground and developed.
· 
To have the App developed
in both iOS and Android platforms I have been quoted by the developing company $10,500,
which is what I will need to get this started. 
· 
Another $1,500 will go
towards the designing and launching of the SpillOut official website.
With
your help I will make this dream come true. And more importantly give our
fellow classmates a way to communicate better.

As you might know, I’ve been living in a very special place as of late…Bali. And for me, what makes Bali so special is the Balinese people themselves. They are the most reverent, honorable, gentle, gracious, and humble people that I’ve ever met. I love being there and being their humble guest.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In my short time there, I’ve wanted to give back in some way. One day I decided to speak to the head of the village I live in and I posed the question, “How can I help?” The first words out of his mouth were, “The school. They need the most help.”</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The school is the only one in our small village and serves 100, K-5 students. I then set up a meeting with the head of the school and met with several teachers to find out what their biggest needs were. To my surprise, the most needed item was chalk! If this was their situation, I wondered what other vital needs the school would have. I proceeded to inventory all the items that were in need. They consisted of general supplies like writing instruments, notebooks, chalk, chalkboards, musical instruments (they have one old keyboard that no longer works), PE supplies (they have only one soccer ball for all 100 students), biology models, teachers’ rulers, art supplies, classroom maps, etc. etc. etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After making the list, the village head and myself went to the nearest big town and priced out all the items necessary to supply each child and classroom with what they needed for the rest of the year and hopefully some of next school year.  The cost came out to be $5000 for all necessary and immediate supplies. This amount will provide what’s necessary now, but won’t get them through the next school year. This will essential buy supplies for 150 students, which gives them a 50% buffer on supplies. But ideally, I would raise $10,000 which would get them through the entire next school year!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I return to Bali on 12/17 and will be purchasing these items myself and delivering them to the school. All funds go 100% directly to buy school supplies and I will stay in control of said funds until all items have been purchased and delivered. My ask is that you become part of this project and find it in your heart to donate any funds that you can. If 100 people donate $100, we are there!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I would have loved to get super creative, and make a video and flashy website for this cause, but life lately has left me with little time. But none of that matters in the end. What matters is that these children get the necessary supplies so that they have the same chances that we all want in life. Thank you humbly for helping the children in the village of Nyuh Kuning, Ubud, Bali.</p>

<h2><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Here's the Big Idea:</span></h2>
<p>I'm a self-financed (bootstrapped) Norwegian startup entrepreneur in Cologne, Germany and I've recently been invited to receive the official Lean Launchpad Instructor training and certification at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stanford</a>, California from professor <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Steve Blank</a>, one of the godfathers of Silicon Valley, the father of Customer Development and the grandfather of the Lean Startup movement.</p>
<p>Blank teaches the Lean Launchpad curriculum at Stanford, Berkeley, Colombia and more on Customer Development, Business Model Generation and the Lean Startup Methodology. It's a big deal in entrepreneurial education. Harvard Business Review recently published an article about <a href=""http://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">why</a>.</p>
<p>And in between founding my own startups, I also teach at our universities because I am incredibly passionate about creating more capable entrepreneurs in our region and great entrepreneurial education is one of the pillars of a great startup ecosystem.</p>
<p>Now I want to take it to the next level and officially bring the most amazing educational program for startup entrepreneurs to Cologne and build a bridge from Silicon Valley, Stanford and Steve Blank to us in Cologne.</p>
<p>And that's not all! I've also been asked to hold a talk at Stanford about our Cologne ecosystem, what makes us unique and what we are doing over here and I think it would be a damned shame if we'd lose out on this incredible opportunity to get our voice heard in Silicon Valley, at Stanford, in front of Steve Blank himself!</p>
<p>And YOUR help is needed to build this bridge over the Atlantic because I believe this should be a team effort. This is not about me. It's about us in Cologne, about our future as a leading startup city, and we should all be able to own a part of this effort to lay these first fundamental building blocks.<br/><br/>Because for a nominal one-time effort, together we can bring the world's leading startup entrepreneurial education from Stanford to Cologne and gain an awesome advantage for our ecosystem for years and years to come - AND to get our voice heard and be noticed in the birth-place of the startup.</p>

<h3>What's Needed &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need around 1.999,- EUR in total for the flight, accommodation, sustenance and some pocket change. I have the great fortune to have been offered the educational program and certification at Stanford for free, which means we don't have to pay the 3.300,- USD fee on top of that.</p>
<p>Economy Flight:               800,- <br/>Late booking due to short notice unfortunately made it pricier</p>
<p>Discounted Accommodation:625,- <br/><a href=""http://blackbox.vc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blackbox.vc</a> will graciously host me at a discount for 10 nights</p>

<p>Pocket Money:                   266,- <br/>Taxi, bus, rails, unexpected stuff, etc. 19 a day for 14 days</p>
<p>IndieGoGo Fee:      minus ca. 42,-</p>
<p>Which leaves us at a aproximate total of 2.000,- and I'm putting my money where my mouth is and paying half of that - So now we only need 1042,- to make this happen.</p>
<p>If we are unable to reach the goal of 1042,- within June 16th - I will not be able to go. I will not be able to share our story about the Cologne startup scene at in Silicon Valley, at Stanford, to Steve Blank and the other international students. There will be no bridge to the Valley, no amazing startup entrepreneurial education to take home to Cologne, no  incredible advantage for our ecosystem for years to come.</p>
<p><strong>If we however manage to beat the goal, I promise to donate every cent above the goal towards the next <a href=""http://cologne.startupweekend.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Startup Weekend Cologne</a> 2014 and name each and every one of you as official private sponsors of that amazing event!</strong></p>
<p>And what do I have for you in addition to the satisfying feeling of supporting entrepreneurial initiative and great entrepreneurial education in our region and getting our scene represented in Silicon Valley and helping to make great things happen for a lot of people for years to come?</p>
<p>Well, I thought it would be only fair to give you something more material on top of that, so I created some unique gifts and rewards to each and every one of you supporting this venture in entrepreneurial education for Cologne.</p>
<p>I'll share the insights shared with me at Stanfrod exclusively with you and I'll also help your startup or company create content and publicity from and in the Bay Area.</p>

<h3>Hi!</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div><div><div><div><div><div><div>My name is Stacy. I
 have been teaching this particular martial arts for about 10 years now 
and I have finally decided to open my own school. Over the past 10 years
 we have helped children and adults with their set goals, whether it be 
gaining self esteem, learning to defend themselves, or just plain 
physical fitness.<p></p>
<p><br/>
In starting this we have put our heart and soul into making a 
great school where our students and their family members feel safe and 
at home.</p>
<p>But...</p>

My name is Stacy. I
 have been teaching this particular martial arts for about 10 years now 
and I have finally decided to open my own school. Over the past 10 years
 we have helped children and adults with their set goals, whether it be 
gaining self esteem, learning to defend themselves, or just plain 
physical fitness.

In starting this we have put our heart and soul into making a 
great school where our students and their family members feel safe and 
at home.
But...
Martial arts studios are one 
of these community resources that has to run as a for-profit, but, in 
practice, runs similarly as a non-profit, due to we are more in the 
field of education than a sport.

For us, we would rather focus on the education of our students
 than on profiting from them. We prefer to enrich our students and their
 families' lives, at the same time making the community around us a 
stronger one.

We are here to help people learn to defend themselves, whether
 it be a six year old learning to defend against a bully or a 70 year 
old gaining the confidence to fend off an attacker.And this is why we need your help.

By helping us over that first year hump you help us continue 
helping the local community and being a community resource for years to 
come.

<p>We are a group of friends who, worried about the low quality education that children in poor communities of the Dominican Republic receive, decided to act. We implemented our first project this past summer, when we hosted a summer camp for children in Los Higos, Jarabacoa, a rural and unprivileged community in the Dominican Republic.<br/></p>This three-weekend-long summer camp was designed to contain
fun, educational activities for children ranging in ages 9-11. The content was
based on the idea of meaningful play, which would allow the children to have
fun while at the same time learn the values that we wished to encourage in
them.  In order to make a stronger
impact, we engaged the children’s families by visiting their homes to talk about
their kid’s progress, as well as inviting them to a final presentation in which
the children performed the play “The Little Prince.”<p></p>
<p>Throughout the summer camp, we realized how much these
children needed our support and the great impact that it was having on them.
Thus, after an incredibly successful summer, we decided to find ways to
continue to work with them. We have designed a 4-month workshop program, which
we want to implement during the second semester of their school year with the
purpose of helping them continue to grow at an intrapersonal, interpersonal,
and academic level. </p>
<p></p>
<p><i>[ Somos un grupo de amigos que, preocupados por la baja calidad de educación

Jarabacoa, una comunidad rural y poco privilegiada de nuestro país. </i></p>
<p><i>Este campamente tuvo una duración de tres fines de semana y su programa contenía
actividades divertidas y educativas diseñadas para niños entre 9 y 11 años de
edad. El contenido se basaba en la idea del juego con sentido, el cual permitiría a los niños recrearse y al mismo tiempo aprender los valores que deseábamos inculcarles.
En miras a tener un mayor impacto, involucramos a las familias de los niños a través
de visitas a sus casas para hablar del progreso de sus hijos, así como también invitándolos
a una presentación final en la cual los chicos recrearon la obra “El Principito”.</i></p>

<p>If you would like to see more women in <strong>Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math</strong> (STEM) fields, here is a chance to directly support that goal.<br/><br/>Dana Whitmore is a young woman seeking a degree in a STEM field -- bioengineering, to be precise. She has a plan for her academic career and a goal for how she wants to apply her learning after she completes her education. She selected a university not for convenience, or ease of studies, or to stay connected with friends and family, but instead with laser-sharp focus on a specific academic program.<br/><br/><b>Montana State University</b> offers more research opportunities for undergraduate students than is typical for a research-focused institution, allowing Dana to explore and pursue her interests while streamlining her career path after school. Engineering graduates from Montana State enjoy high levels of placement as well as strong starting salaries. Completion of her coursework at MSU will offer a solid launch for her STEM-focused career.</p>
<h2>Academic Performance</h2>
<p>Smart, dedicated, and competitive, Dana sets a high standard as a student. An AP class teacher wrote about her, ""[A] rare combination of intellectual rigor with a degree of humility makes Dana an ideal scholar."" She has great grades and was well within the top 10% of her high school graduating class. She participated in track and lettered in lacrosse, played bass clarinet in band and wind ensemble, and pitched in to help on school theater productions. During high school, Dana spent countless hours volunteering for a variety of organizations, handling tasks ranging from transcribing videos and audio recordings, to restoring trails, to guiding new students at school. She's an <b>AP Scholar with Distinction</b> (<a href=""http://www.collegeboard.org/apscholar"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">see what that means</a>). She's an Honor Society member. She has academic awards adorning her walls. She is delighted that she has a room assignment in a quiet, all-female dorm, on a floor that is set aside for female engineering students.<br/><br/>When Dana found out, during Orientation on campus, that Montana State has an Honors program that she could try for, she sat down and wrote an essay with zero preparation. She promptly qualified for entry into the program, despite having had little sleep and a long road trip from the Seattle area.</p>
<h2>And then... Finances</h2>
<p>What does Dana not have? She lacks a wealthy family to support her through college. While financial aid covers a large part of her estimated cost of attendance (primarily through loans), and although she received a scholarship to bring the cost of her attendance from the out-of-state rate almost down to the in-state rate, there's still a significant gap that was expected to be covered by a parental loan -- a loan that is simply not possible for her financially-struggling family.<br/><br/>Dana started at MSU as a Freshman in Fall 2013. Classes began in late August, and by early August she needed to have paid her bill for tuition, housing, dining (the least expensive meal plan, which does not even include weekends), and various fees. To the extent that work study is a part of her financial aid package, any funds from that would not be available until well after the bill was due. Still lacking sufficient funds when it came time to pay the bill, Dana used a deferred payment plan to split the payment into parts. The remaining payments will be due soon.<br/></p>
<h2>This Crowdfunding Project</h2>
<p>All funds raised through this Indiegogo project will go into an education-only account. We don't expect to be able to raise the tens of thousands of dollars that are actually needed, but every dollar will help. <strong>Even a $1 donation helps the visibility of this project on Indiegogo.</strong><br/><br/>If you would rather not donate but prefer to buy something directly, please see the variety of items available in the <a href=""http://www.cafepress.com/danasdragons"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Dana's Dragons"">Dana's Dragons</a> shop on CafePress.

Kosovo and Serbia drove tens of thousands of refugees into Macedonia,</b> a country
of around 2 million people. This large influx of people placed great stress on
Macedonia society, leading to conflicts between the ethnic Albanians and ethnic
Macedonians. <b>These tensions have remained a point of stress, causing the
eruption of ethnic violence as recently as 2012.</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/742442/files/20140724200735-Flag_Map_Of_Fyr_Macedonia_clip_art_hight.png?1406257655"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><b><br/></b><p></p>
<p><b>While in Macedonia I will develop a sports program that will
bring the diverse ethnicities in Skopje together to play sports and enable
people from the different groups to build trust and friendships that strengthen

will play sports together and learn life skills, from healthy living to
conflict resolution to leadership skills. <b>Most importantly it will give them a
safe, fun environment to get to know one another and build friendships.</b> These
relationships have the potential to positively impact many aspects of
Macedonian society as these youth learn the value of ethnic diversity at a
young age and bring about unity that has yet to take root. </p>
<p><b>BTIF is unable to provide a salary so we are raising our own
funds for the internship. We need to raise a total of $12,500 to cover flights, health
insurance and living expenses, including rent. We hope to raise AT LEAST $6,000 through this campaign. </b></p>

to see people live to their potential I am working towards an MA in Human
Security and Peacebuilding at Royal Roads University in Victoria, Canada.
My wife, Erin, our two children, and I are relocating from
Oregon, USA to Skopje, Macedonia to work with the Boris Trajkovski
International Foundation (BTIF) to fulfill my degree’s requirement of a
six-month internship.  (To learn about
the good work that BTIF does please visit http://www.boristrajkovski.org/en/.)
Macedonia is a very diverse country with a long history of
various people groups residing in the region. In 2001 the conflict between
Kosovo and Serbia drove tens of thousands of refugees into Macedonia, a country
of around 2 million people. This large influx of people placed great stress on
Macedonia society, leading to conflicts between the ethnic Albanians and ethnic
Macedonians. These tensions have remained a point of stress, causing the
eruption of ethnic violence as recently as 2012.
While in Macedonia I will develop a sports program that will
bring the diverse ethnicities in Skopje together to play sports and enable
people from the different groups to build trust and friendships that strengthen
society. This will be accomplished through weekly gatherings where participants
will play sports together and learn life skills, from healthy living to
conflict resolution to leadership skills. Most importantly it will give them a
safe, fun environment to get to know one another and build friendships. These
relationships have the potential to positively impact many aspects of
Macedonian society as these youth learn the value of ethnic diversity at a
young age and bring about unity that has yet to take root. 
BTIF is unable to provide a salary so we are raising our own
funds for the internship. We need to raise a total of $12,500 to cover flights, health
insurance and living expenses, including rent. We hope to raise AT LEAST $6,000 through this campaign. 
We appreciate any support you can give as we begin to work
towards building strong cross-ethnic relationships in Macedonia.To get updates before and after our move, please follow Erin's blog, Home & Grace.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>For the past couple months we have been seeking Jesus's face and asking him what's next for us and our nation. We really felt that the Lord was speaking to our hearts about change not only for us in our personal lives, but our nation as well!</p>

I have been trying to get the school to give me funding since November of last year and the only type of funding they have given me, has been to approve me for two $1,000.00 loans to my endeavor, which are sadly not enough.I'm not asking for a lot from each person, but all I am asking is that if you have a little bit to give I would appreciate it.I would need this money within the next 7 days, by April 25th, 2014. If you cannot help please feel free to pass this along to someone who can, thank you for your time.-Shaquille Anderson",0.0,0,"1 Campaign
