intended to reinforce our Defeat In Detail range of models, by adding more models to the existing ranges.As we cross stretch goals, we'll be unlocking more models, some of which can be seen in silhouette below...We have many designs already sculpted, and without a crowdfunding campaign it would be another year or even two before we could afford to put them all into production, so your interest and support at this stage means we can put out more metal models at a much faster rate than would otherwise be possible.The ModelsAll of the models in this campaign are to be METAL models, unless otherwise stated.Most of the models have already been Matter Printed and are awaiting a trip to the casting foundry, whilst other models only exist as-yet in CAD form - your support now will ensure they become real tiny toy fighty models!  Novan Elites PathfindersNovan Elites Pathfinders are highly trained and equipped with the very best armaments and reconnaissance assets.Each set of

<h2><i>A játék előkészületei és célja:</i></h2>
<p>A cél elnyerni A NAGY EMBER kegyeit, mindenki más kárára. Ez úgy érhető el, ha a strómanjaid biztonságban hazaérnek, összesen 10 sikeres akciót végrehajtva.</p>
<p>A strómankártyákat először keverjétek össze, majd helyezzétek el a táblára, szöveggel lefelé.</p>
<p>Egy játékosnak négy különböző színű bábuja van, ezeket kezdés előtt a pályán kívül kijelölt helyekre kell tenni.</p>
<p>A játék célja mind a négy figurát a pályán körbejáratva eljuttatni a pálya közepén levő kis területre, amelynek neve <i>ház</i>.</p>
<p>A játék másik teljesítendő célja összeszedni 10 strómanpontot.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">A játék szabályai</h2>
<p>A játékosok egy kockával dobnak.</p>
<p>Egy bábut a saját startmezőn át kell játékba hozni, az óramutatóval ellentétes irányban.</p>
<p>A játékba hozásra akkor van lehetőség, ha a játékos 1-est vagy 6-ost dob.</p>
<p>Amennyiben nincs a játékosnak játékban egy bábuja sem, háromszor dobhat.</p>
<p>A bábut a színes mezőre kell helyezni, ilyenkor a játékos még egyet dobhat.</p>
<p>Ha a startmezőn bábu áll, akkor oda kitehető új bábu, ezáltal kidobatik az ott álló.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1546358654/ai9osxbzzk0jyls8co3d.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>6-os dobás esetén nem kötelező pályán kívül levő bábut játékba hozni.</p>
<p>A játékosok bármelyik játékban lévő bábuval léphetnek, amennyiben az adott színű bábujuk játékban van.</p>
<p>A játékos a dobás után bármelyik, színben megegyező bábuval a megfelelő számú mezőt lép menetirányba.</p>
<p>A menetirány abban az esetben lehet fordított, ha így lehetőség nyílik egy másik játékban lévő bábu kidobására.</p>
<p>Megegyező színű bábuk kidobása lehetséges, sőt, ajánlott.</p>
<p>Amikor több bábuja van a pályán, akkor a játékos eldöntheti, hogy melyikkel lép.</p>
<p>A bábuk átugorhatják egymást, de az átugrott mező is beleszámít a lépésbe.</p>
<p>Ha egy bábu eléri a startmezőt olyan játékosnál, akinél az adott színű bábu játékban van, befordul a kerti útra, és halad a ház felé. Amelyik bábu beért a házba, az nem lép többet.</p>
<p>Ha a játékos egy bábuval olyan mezőre lép, amelyen egy másik játékos bábuja van, akkor azt a bábut kiüti, és azt visszaadja az általa választott játékosnak, akinek játékban volt ilyen színű bábuja, amit a szabály szerint kell újra játékba hozni.</p>
<p>A „kerti úton” haladó bábu már nem üthető ki. Leüthető viszont az a bábu is, amelyik a színes startmezőn áll.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1546358674/nqfhww1lx983zlfcafhl.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h2><i>Strómanpontok</i></h2>
<p>Strómankártyát a játékos három különböző módon szerezhet:</p>
<ul>
<li>A bábujával „hazaért” / ezzel teljesítette a strómanra bízott feladatot</li>
<li>Kiütött egy strómant / ezzel mással kapartatta ki a gesztenyét</li>
<li>A táblán a strómankártya mezőre lépett / ezzel elnyerte A NAGY EMBER dicséretét</li>
</ul>
<p>A kártya húzása után derül ki, hogy sikeres volt-e az adott Stróman-akció. A sikeres akciók után (NYERTÉL kártyák) jár egy + strómanpont, a sikertelenek után (VESZTESZ kártyák) egy – strómanpont.</p>
<p>A játék befejezéséhez 10 + strómanpont elérése szükséges.</p>
<p>Amennyiben a negyedik stróman „hazaérkeztekor” nincs meg a kellő számú strómanpont, úgy a negyedik stróman nem léphet a házba, tovább kell köröznie a pályán mindaddig, míg meg nem szerzi a szükséges számú strómanpontot.</p>
<p>A strómanpontok megléte után pontos számú dobással „hazatérhet”.</p>

</div></div>","A Játék
Valahol, egy messzi-messzi galaxisban, épül a NER (Némileg Erkölcstelen Ripacsok) Rendszere. Megállítani nem lehet, és neked nem is ez a célod!

Irányítsd a Strómanjaid!
Gyűjts Stróman-pontokat!
Mássz minél mélyebben A NAGY EMBER... kegyeibe



Mit szeretnénk & Mit kapsz
Egy csodás játékot, ami szórakoztat

A játékot azért fejlesztettük, hogy ne csak sírjunk, nevessünk is
Mindenképp megkapod a rendelésed, a cél elérésétől függetlenül
Reméljük, tartalmas szórakozást kínálunk Nektek!



A csomagok
Amennyiben csak ajándékokat szeretnél kapni, annak sincs akadálya.

1 dollárért kaphatsz egy eredeti strómanérmét, ami kiválóan alkalmas bevásárló kocsikba
5 dollárért kaphatsz egy gyönyörű Káder János-posztert


A játék célja
A célod elnyerni A NAGY EMBER kegyeit, mindenki más kárára. Ezt úgy érheted el, ha a strómanjaid biztonságban hazaérnek összesen 10 sikeres akciót végrehajtva.

A játék előkészületei és célja:
A cél elnyerni A NAGY EMBER kegyeit, mindenki más kárára. Ez úgy érhető el, ha a strómanjaid biztonságban hazaérnek, összesen 10 sikeres akciót végrehajtva.
A strómankártyákat először keverjétek össze, majd helyezzétek el a táblára, szöveggel lefelé.
Egy játékosnak négy különböző színű bábuja van, ezeket kezdés előtt a pályán kívül kijelölt helyekre kell tenni.
A játék célja mind a négy figurát a pályán körbejáratva eljuttatni a pálya közepén levő kis területre, amelynek neve ház.
A játék másik teljesítendő célja összeszedni 10 strómanpontot.

A játék szabályai
A játékosok egy kockával dobnak.
Egy bábut a saját startmezőn át kell játékba hozni, az óramutatóval ellentétes irányban.
A játékba hozásra akkor van lehetőség, ha a játékos 1-est vagy 6-ost dob.
Amennyiben nincs a játékosnak játékban egy bábuja sem, háromszor dobhat.
A bábut a színes mezőre kell helyezni, ilyenkor a játékos még egyet dobhat.
Ha a startmezőn bábu áll, akkor oda kitehető új bábu, ezáltal kidobatik az ott álló.

6-os dobás esetén nem kötelező pályán kívül levő bábut játékba hozni.
A játékosok bármelyik játékban lévő bábuval léphetnek, amennyiben az adott színű bábujuk játékban van.
A játékos a dobás után bármelyik, színben megegyező bábuval a megfelelő számú mezőt lép menetirányba.
A menetirány abban az esetben lehet fordított, ha így lehetőség nyílik egy másik játékban lévő bábu kidobására.
Megegyező színű bábuk kidobása lehetséges, sőt, ajánlott.
Amikor több bábuja van a pályán, akkor a játékos eldöntheti, hogy melyikkel lép.
A bábuk átugorhatják egymást, de az átugrott mező is beleszámít a lépésbe.
Ha egy bábu eléri a startmezőt olyan játékosnál, akinél az adott színű bábu játékban van, befordul a kerti útra, és halad a ház felé. Amelyik bábu beért a házba, az nem lép többet.
Ha a játékos egy bábuval olyan mezőre lép, amelyen egy másik játékos bábuja van, akkor azt a bábut kiüti, és azt visszaadja az általa választott játékosnak, akinek játékban volt ilyen színű bábuja, amit a szabály szerint kell újra játékba hozni.
A „kerti úton” haladó bábu már nem üthető ki. Leüthető viszont az a bábu is, amelyik a színes startmezőn áll.

Strómanpontok
Strómankártyát a játékos három különböző módon szerezhet:

A bábujával „hazaért” / ezzel teljesítette a strómanra bízott feladatot
Kiütött egy strómant / ezzel mással kapartatta ki a gesztenyét
A táblán a strómankártya mezőre lépett / ezzel elnyerte A NAGY EMBER dicséretét

A kártya húzása után derül ki, hogy sikeres volt-e az adott Stróman-akció. A sikeres akciók után (NYERTÉL kártyák) jár egy + strómanpont, a sikertelenek után (VESZTESZ kártyák) egy – strómanpont.
A játék befejezéséhez 10 + strómanpont elérése szükséges.
Amennyiben a negyedik stróman „hazaérkeztekor” nincs meg a kellő számú strómanpont, úgy a negyedik stróman nem léphet a házba, tovább kell köröznie a pályán mindaddig, míg meg nem szerzi a szükséges számú strómanpontot.
A strómanpontok megléte után pontos számú dobással „hazatérhet”.

TAKTIKÁK:
 
A „Dögöljön meg a szomszéd tehene” hadmozdulat:
A „Kék“ játékos vagy, kettőt dobtál, sárga bábud van játékban, akárcsak az ellenfelednek, a „Zöld“ játékosnak.

Bár a hozzád közelebb eső sárga bábu mozgása esetleg közelebb hozhatna téged a „házadhoz“, de a távolabbival lépve a „Zöld“ játékosnak lehetetlenné teszed, hogy hazaérjen.
Valódi NERLOVAG húzás, neked nem jó, de az ellenfelednek nagyon rossz!
A „Kibedobás”
A „Kék” játékos vagy, ellenfeleidnek játékban vannak a sárga bábuik, neked nincs, viszont épp egyest / hatost dobtál.
Egyes / hatos dobással behelyezed te is a sárga bábut a játéktérre.

Újra egyes / hatost dobsz, így fogsz egy másik bábut, és kidobod vele az általad előző dobásnál játékba hozott sárga bábut

Kiválaszthatod, melyik ellenfeledet dobtad ki!
Csodás mozdulat, páratlan élmény látni ellenfeleid felháborodását, valódi, NERLOVAGhoz illő megmozdulás!
A „Hátra az új előre” hadmozdulat
A „Kék” játékos vagy, épp egy egyes / hatos dobással sikerült játékba helyezned a piros bábudat, a következő dobásod egy hármas.

A szabályok értelmében hátrafele akkor mehetsz a pályán, ha lehetőséged van kidobni az ellenfeled, ami a fent említett eset, tehát kidobhatod a mögötted álló sárga bábut.

Ezt követő körben azonban, mivel a bábud már megmozdult a kiindulási helyéről, a piros bábuddal nyugodtan beléphetsz a „házba”, nem számít, hogy hátrafele indultál el.
Csodás hadművelet, ami garantáltan idegessé teszi ellenfeleid!",13.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>The drink coasters are being shipped by the USPS (United States Postal Service) both for domestic and world-wide rewards.</p>
<p>They are being sent in #10 size security-tinted business envelopes. Each envelope can hold up to four (4) coasters.</p>

<p>A pledge for a set of 4 coasters would be packed into one envelope.</p>
<p>A pledge for 8 coasters will be packed into two separate envelopes: (four coasters in each of 2 envelopes). </p>
<p>A pledge for 12 coasters will be packed into three separate envelopes: (four coasters in each of 3 envelopes).</p>
<p>The coasters will be fitted securely into a very simple holder I'm making out of paper and will slide into the envelope, fitting from edge-to-edge. This should keep the coasters from slipping around inside the envelope.</p>
<p>I’ve already done numerous test shipments in business envelopes, both to locations within the US and overseas. No problems with damage to the coasters as of yet!</p>

This book goes into the in-depth lore on our 12 core races: Earth Ponies, Pegasi, Unicorns, Zebras, Griffons, Dipped Alicorns, Natural Born Alicorns, Diamond Dogs, Hellhounds, Dragons, Ghouls and Foals. GM Bullshit The Overmare: This is our Game Master’s guide, filled with chart tables, NPCs and boss guides, traps, taint, and more! This book is designed to be everything a GM needs and then some!Hoofticuffs:Our martial arts guide, with over 20 different martial arts to master, from the well-known styles like Fallen Caesar to our own invented martial arts like Titan Slayer, this book focuses on everything you'll need to be a Martial Arts Master!The Locked Safe:List porn. Every item, perk, trait, spell, and mechanic we’ve devised for this project and more! With 1000+ items, 1500+ perks, and over 300 spells across nine spell schools, this compendium is sure to tickle your tumblers! The Gilded Cage:This is our Bestiary. It will contain… well, all the beasts, and monsters, and mobs, as well as a section on how to make your own monsters, and the necessary tools to make your own, including monster perks!You think we’re done? We’re just getting started!3D printed figurines, which are being sculpted out of clay, scanned with a 3D scanner, then being cleaned up in a 3D editing software, are also being developed.We will also be releasing a folding map board with your very own PipBuck 3000 world map.A GM Blind with all the tools necessary for any GM to bring out the best (or worst) the Wasteland has to offer.An RPG dice set with a custom-minted D2 coin.CDs/thumb drives with digital copies of the books, character sheets, and more, as well as links to the most up-to-date lists and sheets.All of this will be available in a complete Box Set, wrapped up in in a pretty box and shipped to your front door.After the initial release, we also plan on releasing a series of Character, Mechanics, and Universe expansion packs, bringing 40+ new playable races, new dark and mysterious magics, vehicles, and new faraway lands tainted by the Megaspells in weird and mysterious ways. What does your money accomplish? (Stretch Goals)Long and short? A lot! If we manage to raise $160,000, we will be able to make minimum orders on all of our books, boxes, CDs, and everything else promised in this project!At $200,000: We can not only make minimum orders, but also purchase extra stock for year-round availability and eliminate the ""Annual Print Project Cycle"" that plagues similar projects such as this.At $300,000: Our promises of expansion packs become more tangible. Raising $300,000 will allow the DTS team to focus more on our next Fallout: Equestria PnP release, including a serious look at: map packs, pre-generated campaigns, more advanced mini figurines, and MORE.At $500,000: Day jobs become less of an issue. Everyone here at Dead Tree Studios has so far been supporting this company with funds from their day jobs. Juggling a 9-5 and working on this project is exhausting, and meeting this stretch goal means the DTS Team not only gets to focus on creating tabletop games in a more full time manner, but it also allows us to have some extra funds for proper advertising, convention representation, hiring MUCH NEEDED help (including artists, editors, and web designers), and more, without financial worry.1,000,000: For a small loan of 1 MILLION DOLLARS, we can complete our dreams of returning to the 80's and making tabletop games for a living (seriously, the thought of leaving the 80's terrifies us)! Meeting this stretch goal will allow us to turn this tabletop passion of ours into a full time job. With this, we will be able to acquire proper office space, guarantee minimum orders on our next big project, set up warehousing, and fund the development of the original games we have planned AFTER our Fallout: Equestria PnP Expansions.  That's right folks, you heard it here first! We are officially powered by BackerKit! What does that mean for you? A lot, actually!Not only will the BackerKit survey allow us to efficiently and professionally organize shipping, ensuring that you fine folks get your rewards AS QUICKLY as possible, it allows us to charge you for shipping AFTER we get all of our products made. This means that you, yes YOU, do not have to over pay on shipping due to our guesses, resulting in you SAVING money and not having to pay a dime more than needed for shipping. It also allows you to upgrade your pledges halfway through the campaign, including add-ons!  BackerKit add-ons, you say?We do! We do say BackerKit add-ons!By either over paying for your reward tier, and receiving in-store credit with Backer-Kit, or by simply paying for your add-ons in BackerKit, you can add on:
Any one book of your choice for $40 each.
The CD with digital copies of all the books and more for $25 each.
A dice set with a set of Chessex dice, a grey velour dice bag, and our custom minted D2 coin for $12 per set.
Any one, 2 inch tall mini figurine for $5 each.

<h3>The Character Crate has 3 primary functions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Miniature Figurine Container: The Character Crate will come in 2 designs; one with a single miniature pocket and one with two miniature pockets (you will decide after the campaign. Perhaps you want to store two characters in a Crate or maybe you have a trusty companion or familiar who deserves their own space. These pockets will have foam padding to protect your heroes. These pockets are designed with plenty of room for standard 28mm miniatures.</li>
<li>Dice Container: The larger pocket will comfortably accommodate 2 - 3 sets of polyhedral dice plus some extras. Many oversized dice will also fit, just in case you are bringing a special set of chunky D6s or other dice to the game.</li>
<li>Dice Rolling Tray: The lid of the Character Crate is completely removable from the Crate itself and is designed to be used as a dice rolling tray. With half inch walls it should contain even the most exuberant dice rolling enthusiast. The lid/tray can be placed back on the Crate in any rotation and is held on by the lip as well as 8 rare earth magnets.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Construction</h3>
<p>The Character Crate is crafted from American Black Cherry wood. This is one of the most prized hardwood's in America for furniture and cabinetry. As an added bonus Cherry is one of few sustainable hardwoods. Cherry ages beautifully over time. It begins light brownish-pink and over time these colors become slightly darker and richer. The Character Crate will come treated with a special finish which will enhance the natural beauty of the wood without the use of harsh chemicals. We designed each component of the Character Crate to be created out of one solid piece of wood so there will be no chance of glue failure due to changes in humidity and environment.</p>

<p><i><strong>Hello and welcome! </strong></i></p>
<p>After nearly two months of hard work I am proud to present to you the Nomadic Caravan Project, which is a collection of wagons, tents, fire camp and various props for different characters that travel around a challenging world facing hardships. Each character has their own unique backstory.</p>

<span style=""display: none;""> </span> <strong>Fortune teller</strong> :<span style=""display: none;""> </span> A woman with a good heart and the founder of the caravan, this fortune teller can reveal what lies ahead of time. She possesses magical abilities, among which is transforming herself into a younger and more seductive self! Who knows, it might come in handy one day! If you enter her tent please do not touch anything! Especially not the chest! Everyone has their secrets, right?</li></ul> <ul><li>

Hello and welcome! 
After nearly two months of hard work I am proud to present to you the Nomadic Caravan Project, which is a collection of wagons, tents, fire camp and various props for different characters that travel around a challenging world facing hardships. Each character has their own unique backstory.
 
The story behind this project

 Merchant :  This merchant offers a broad range of wares, from llama spit to dragon scales! Find what you need, as long as you have the money! 
  Merchant`s wife :  selling medicinal herbs and spices. If something ails you she might be able to sooth your pain! 
  Fortune teller :  A woman with a good heart and the founder of the caravan, this fortune teller can reveal what lies ahead of time. She possesses magical abilities, among which is transforming herself into a younger and more seductive self! Who knows, it might come in handy one day! If you enter her tent please do not touch anything! Especially not the chest! Everyone has their secrets, right? 
  Sisters of the war pact :  Every camp needs guards, and these three sisters are it for our caravan! They have a strong bond with the caravan's founder, our fortune teller, who brought these orphaned girls up as her own daughters. With the proper fee, they'll happily join you in your adventures! 
  Torn face :  Fighting a ferocious monster with sharp claws left his face torn and disfigured! Lacking the proper expertise, the fortune teller resorted to just stitching the two sides of his face together. Blindness has sharpened his sense of hearing into an almost superhuman ability! His physical strength remains! No one can survive under his iron fists!  
   Hunter :  A sharp shooter with high visual acuity! No hunt is finished without securing a bounty, bringing game and valuable live specimens back for trade.
 
 Dishonored knight : Only a true warrior knows the depths of shame after a defeat in combat. Being overwhelmed by his loss he contemplated suicide, but some mysterious events and the arrival of the caravan prevented this outcome. The battlefield cost him one of his arms, which made possible a curious innovation!
 
 Troupe group : Sit a while and listen! You will find entertainment for hours while you repose after a long day's journey.  Servant girl : She was found unconscious, with any recollection of the events that had just passed. The only thing she could remember was a dragon... yes, there was a dragon somewhere! (Stay tuned for future project!)  Hunter - zombie version : Damn, that crate definitely had a ""do not touch"" sign on it! Our brave and adventurous hunter dared to get near a zombie that was found dormant in the jungle. The creature quickly sensed his presence and fiercely attacked him, succeeding in infecting him with a bite. Not being severely injured, he managed to put the creature back in its crate! But our hunter now has a secret, that will end up transforming him! (Stay tuned for future project!)  Dwarf : Who ever heard of a dwarf that doesn't like his liquor!? This renowned merchant sells the best wines around, sometimes rarities found in deep and forgotten cellars!   Merchant`s daughter : Are you looking for fresh wild berries, fruits and vegetables? This is the place to look! This young merchant has a vibrant connection to nature and is easily able to source food!

<p>The Gamefolio System is totally unique. It’s got that special “one of a kind” quality that makes people take notice. It adapts to your games and your gaming lifestyle.</p>
<ul>
<li>Games are different. They use various combinations of boards, cards, miniatures, tiles, dice, tokens, coins, and other components.</li>
<li>Gaming situations are different. They can include game nights at home, out with friends, hanging out with your local guild, at your local game store or cafe, or hitting up gaming conventions and tournaments. They can also include traveling across town or around the globe.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our gear was designed with all of this in mind and has got your back!</p>

<p>Your games and our gear will become best friends! Our gear will allow you to instantly customize your game carrying, organization, storage, and protection. Gamefolio cases and the Vault bag maximize the number of games and gear you can carry in a minimized amount of space. Board games, card games, miniatures, dice, RPG? There’s a Gamefolio for that and the Vault duffle works great directly with your game boxes, our Gamefolio cases, foam trays or a combination. Using Gamefolios has the added benefit of protecting your game boxes and the artwork thereon while keeping your game pieces from getting jumbled like a tossed salad or falling all over the place should you accidentally drop, bump or knock over a Gamefolio or the bag they are in. Game boxes aren’t so forgiving.</p>

<p><b>How Add-Ons Work:</b></p>
<p>Want to add additional items from the above list to your reward? How about extra Gamefolio cases, another Vault bag, or some additional foam trays? No worries, it’s easy to do:</p>
<p><b>1. Choose a reward level during the campaign:</b> Choose one reward level on the campaign to become a backer of this project. You will get all items in that reward level.</p>
<p><b>2. Want to add-on something?</b> If you want to add something additional to your reward, check out the Add-On Menu above. If it's in the Add-On Menu you will be able to add it to your reward through the pledge manager after the campaign ends. The pledge manager works like a typical website shopping cart. You will be able to go through it and select any add-ons you want to add to your pledge reward.</p>
<p><b>3. Relax, you're done for now:</b> Once the campaign ends, you’ll get an email invite to the pledge manager. Through the pledge manager, you will be able to add any additional items you are interested in from the Add-On Menu above to your rewards. Other details like shipping information, color choices, and shipping fees will also be collected through the pledge manager after this campaign has ended.</p>

<p>All shipping fees and shipping info for your rewards will be collected through our pledge manager after this campaign has ended.</p>
<p>We ship <b>Worldwide</b> and our project is US, EU, AU, CA, and CN Friendly! This means that rewards bound for those areas will ship from within the specific country/region, resulting in no additional customs charges for backers within these areas. We will look to do the same in other regions if we get a high enough number of backers in each region to make it viable. If you are outside of those areas we will be shipping to you from a fulfillment center as near you as possible to keep shipping as low as possible. We work hard to ensure the best shipping fees and care for your reward shipments.</p>

<p><b>Shipping Fees</b></p>
<p>Below are the actual shipping rates for each reward level. <b>REMEMBER:</b> All shipping fees will be collected through our pledge manager after this campaign ends. If you have any questions on shipping please send us a direct message.</p>
<div data-id=""18609937""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/018/609/937/9f003e8b4498ad7172fcf7c12cb37105_original.png?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1507150292&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=1f5f6c78127269578a4f54b49b04f966"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>Please note that the shipping fees listed above are for the specific reward listed at the top of each column. Any additional rewards that you add-on in the pledge manager may add to the cost of shipping, but they will be bundled with your overall package so the total shipping will be much less than if the items were to be shipped separately.</p>

<p>We will be using the Backerkit pledge manager after the campaign ends to collect shipping info, shipping fees, color options, and for any additional reward add-ons or upgrades you choose.</p>
<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Once we have it ready, you will receive an email invite to the pledge manager, so please make sure the email you have on your account is accurate. We will also send an update through the campaign to make sure everyone is aware that the pledge manager has opened.

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>We delivered successfully on our original Gamefolio System 1.0 project and have a ton of business success in our DNA from other endeavors. We’ve also teamed up with experienced manufacturers to take this dream to the next level. They produce products for Nike, Adidas, and other high profile clients. They know how to manufacture high-quality goods at scale. We are confident that we will deliver what we say we will. Should unforeseen issues come up, we will handle them with transparency and care for you, our backers.</p>
<p>Forecasting Risk<br/>If all goes well during our funding campaign, we'll finish up with a lot of backers and demand. Of course, we're trying our hardest to predict our future demand and plan accordingly, but it's not an exact science. However, we have put in place systems and partnerships that allow us to scale up as needed.</p>
<p>Supply Chain Risk<br/>As outlined above, our manufacturer is more than capable of handling our needs now and into the foreseeable future. Though highly unlikely, should any major issues arise that could jeopardize our current manufacturer's ability to produce and deliver on this project, we have additional manufacturer relationships we can shift to. We have established these backup manufacturing supply chains to make sure we can take care of our backers and bring our products to life. However, as prepared as we are there is still some risk in this area and some things that are out of our direct control. If a container shipment is delayed for 2 weeks in customs or a batch of new material doesn't pass QA testing, our fulfillment schedule — even if padded — can start to slip.</p>

The Gamefolio System 2.0 is an adaptable, intelligent, purpose-built system of bags, cases, and accessories for gaming enthusiasts. Our solutions work with tabletop games, board games, card games, miniatures games, dice games, RPG, and more! Our gear is perfect for gaming on the go and will take your gaming experience to a whole new level!
Our products feature a lifetime guarantee, durable, highly water-resistant fabric, protective, impact resistant foam padding, high-quality metal hardware, self-healing zippers, seat belt grade handles and shoulder straps, and a variety of pockets, pouches, compartments, and configurations to take care of your gaming gear like a boss.
Our 1.0 system was a huge success on Kickstarter in 2016 and we are excited to share with you the next step in our evolution, The Gamefolio System 2.0. Pledge now to help us bring this project to life!

The Gamefolio System is totally unique. It’s got that special “one of a kind” quality that makes people take notice. It adapts to your games and your gaming lifestyle.

Games are different. They use various combinations of boards, cards, miniatures, tiles, dice, tokens, coins, and other components.
Gaming situations are different. They can include game nights at home, out with friends, hanging out with your local guild, at your local game store or cafe, or hitting up gaming conventions and tournaments. They can also include traveling across town or around the globe.

Our gear was designed with all of this in mind and has got your back!

Your games and our gear will become best friends! Our gear will allow you to instantly customize your game carrying, organization, storage, and protection. Gamefolio cases and the Vault bag maximize the number of games and gear you can carry in a minimized amount of space. Board games, card games, miniatures, dice, RPG? There’s a Gamefolio for that and the Vault duffle works great directly with your game boxes, our Gamefolio cases, foam trays or a combination. Using Gamefolios has the added benefit of protecting your game boxes and the artwork thereon while keeping your game pieces from getting jumbled like a tossed salad or falling all over the place should you accidentally drop, bump or knock over a Gamefolio or the bag they are in. Game boxes aren’t so forgiving.

The Vault duffle bag works with tabletop games, board games, card games, dice games, miniatures, and more. It works great directly with game boxes, all types of Gamefolios, and foam trays for cards and miniatures! It's durable, highly-water resistant, padded construction is perfect for game nights with friends, traveling with your games, gaming conventions or tournaments, as well as taking care of your games at home. The Vaults innovative full zipper opening gives you easy access to everything inside. This latest version of the Vault has an upgraded padded handle with snap closure to let you get down to gaming lightning fast. It also has seat belt grade handles and shoulder straps. The side pouches can hold Small Gamefolios, Binder Gamefolios or additional games, snacks, drinks, electronics, pens, paper, and whatever else you need while gaming on the go!

 
 

The Large Gamefolio has the same durable, highly-water resistant, padded construction as our other bags and cases. It comes with its own shoulder strap and is perfect for gaming on the go on its own or inside the Vault duffle bag. (Up to two Large Gamefolios can fit inside the Vault duffle) It pairs perfectly with our foam trays for card heavy games and miniatures or without to hold larger games with lots of pieces. It has 2 large pockets inside for play mats, card binders, boards, and other gear. The outside has pen holders and a drink pouch that can also carry a play mat or other gear.

  

 

This is the 2.0 version of our Classic Gamefolio, the one that started it all! It has the same high quality, durable, water-resistant, padded construction as our other bags and cases and is also shoulder strap compatible. (Shoulder strap not included) This 2.0 version now has removable pocket strips, further increasing the modularity and usability of this case. It also has a large dedicated pocket for game boards and comes with 6 removable zipper pouches for organizing all your game pieces. Use Classic Gamefolios on their own or with our Vault duffle bag. The Vault can hold 4-5 Classic Gamefolios, depending on how full each case is. One to three games or more can fit inside each Classic Gamefolio depending on the size and structure of each game.

 
  

The Small Gamefolio case has the same high quality, durable, water-resistant, padded construction as our other bags and cases and is also shoulder strap compatible. (Shoulder strap not included) It is perfect for smaller games, card games, dice games, and similar. The Small Gamefolio works great on its own or with our Vault duffle bag. The Vault can hold two Small Gamefolio cases in each side pouch, for a total of four. One to three small games can fit inside each Small Gamefolio depending on the size and structure of each game.

    
 

The Binder Gamefolio case has the same high quality, durable, water-resistant, padded construction as our other bags and cases. Its modular design includes a removable one-inch, three-ring binder insert as well as a large inner pocket and pen holder. It is excellent for CCG and other card games. Removing the three-ring binder insert makes the Binder Gamefolio usable for game boards and other options. The Binder Gamefolio works great on its own or with our Vault duffle bag. The Vault can hold one Binder Gamefolio case in each side pouch. (Card pages are not included).

 

 

Our EVA Foam Card Tray is perfect for card heavy games, CCG, TCG, Deck Builders, and more. So whether you're into Magic the Gathering, Pokemon, Dominion or other card heavy games, the EVA Card Tray has got your back. With 9 modular removable foam dividers included, organizing your decks is a snap. Our Card Tray works with loose cards, sleeved cards, double sleeved cards, deck boxes of all kinds, dice bags, and more. The Card Tray fits right inside our Large Gamefolio, making gaming on the go with large numbers of cards an easy endeavor. It holds 2,000+ cards depending on sleeve or deck box use and what kind.

 

Our Foam Trays for Miniatures come in various sizes to fit either directly in the Vault duffle bag or the Large Gamefolio case. Options include 1"", 2"", 3"", & 4"" pluck foam or solid foam trays. You can customize the pluck foam trays by simply plucking out the pre-cut foam cubes in the configuration you want. The solid foam trays give you full control to customize them exactly how you want, allowing you to cut them to the specific design and depth needed to cradle each game piece perfectly. Each foam tray features a high-quality, durable EVA foam base with a soft foam upper, ideal for protecting your game pieces.

Color Options
Gamefolio Cases and Vault Duffle Bags come in the following 4 color options as shown in the image below; Blue, Green, Gray, Purple. (Black will become an option if that stretch goal is met):

 
 

To back The Gamefolio System 2.0, choose a reward level that contains the specific reward you want in the right side column toward the top of this page. It's that simple! Once you have pledged, sit back and relax... But, only after you've told all your friends about us!!! We'll collect your shipping info, color options, add-ons, and shipping fees after the project ends, through our pledge manager.
Once you pledge, you're in for a fun ride. Throughout our campaign, we'll be updating backers with info and pictures, game nights with the team, and other fun stuff.
 

 

 

 

Backers will be able to add-on additional reward items and upgrade their pledges through our pledge manager after the campaign ends. Add-ons are completely optional and may require increased pledge amounts and shipping fees. ALL add-ons will be managed through the pledge manager; so no need to increase your pledge through the campaign for add-ons but if you do, any extra funds will automatically roll over into the pledge manager for use there.
Add-On Menu: (The following items will be available as add-ons through the pledge manager. Let us know if you don't see something that you'd like us to consider adding as an add-on.)

$1 Each: Tasty Card Sleeves, Pack of 50 (by Tasty Minstrel Games)
$5 Each: Extra Zipper Pouches, Bundles of 6
$15 Each: Vault Rain Cover
$10 Each: Additional Shoulder Straps
$10 Each: Foam trays for Miniatures for the Large Gamefolio

How Add-Ons Work:
Want to add additional items from the above list to your reward? How about extra Gamefolio cases, another Vault bag, or some additional foam trays? No worries, it’s easy to do:
1. Choose a reward level during the campaign: Choose one reward level on the campaign to become a backer of this project. You will get all items in that reward level.
2. Want to add-on something? If you want to add something additional to your reward, check out the Add-On Menu above. If it's in the Add-On Menu you will be able to add it to your reward through the pledge manager after the campaign ends. The pledge manager works like a typical website shopping cart. You will be able to go through it and select any add-ons you want to add to your pledge reward.
3. Relax, you're done for now: Once the campaign ends, you’ll get an email invite to the pledge manager. Through the pledge manager, you will be able to add any additional items you are interested in from the Add-On Menu above to your rewards. Other details like shipping information, color choices, and shipping fees will also be collected through the pledge manager after this campaign has ended.

All shipping fees and shipping info for your rewards will be collected through our pledge manager after this campaign has ended.
We ship Worldwide and our project is US, EU, AU, CA, and CN Friendly! This means that rewards bound for those areas will ship from within the specific country/region, resulting in no additional customs charges for backers within these areas. We will look to do the same in other regions if we get a high enough number of backers in each region to make it viable. If you are outside of those areas we will be shipping to you from a fulfillment center as near you as possible to keep shipping as low as possible. We work hard to ensure the best shipping fees and care for your reward shipments.

Shipping Fees
Below are the actual shipping rates for each reward level. REMEMBER: All shipping fees will be collected through our pledge manager after this campaign ends. If you have any questions on shipping please send us a direct message.

Please note that the shipping fees listed above are for the specific reward listed at the top of each column. Any additional rewards that you add-on in the pledge manager may add to the cost of shipping, but they will be bundled with your overall package so the total shipping will be much less than if the items were to be shipped separately.

We will be using the Backerkit pledge manager after the campaign ends to collect shipping info, shipping fees, color options, and for any additional reward add-ons or upgrades you choose.
IMPORTANT: Once we have it ready, you will receive an email invite to the pledge manager, so please make sure the email you have on your account is accurate. We will also send an update through the campaign to make sure everyone is aware that the pledge manager has opened. Please help us get your rewards to you as soon as possible by completing the pledge manager as soon as you can once it is open. Be prepared to fill out the pledge manager with your shipping info, color choices, and any add-ons you want.

What do real gamers think about the Gamefolio System?

  Years ago we were hanging out with several friends, discussing various aspects of gaming and the industry in general.We discussed our love of games, various ways to organize and transport them easily, and ways to make sure they were safely protected and well taken care of. We were tired of subpar non-solutions and thought it absurd that our beloved games were stuck being carried around from place to place in big blue shopping bags, or plastic tote bins, continually scuffing, scratching and damaging the beautiful box art along the way. (Not to mention the inevitable tossed salad effect on the game components inside.)As we discussed our frustrations with one another, we decided we were done settling and that something had to be done. A better solution needed to be created. We set out to do just that. Over the years, with continual feedback, testing and design ideas from our team, loyal fans, and industry insiders, we have developed and refined The Gamefolio System to make playing, transporting, storing and protecting your games simple and safe.We are excited to take this dream to the next level with your help!

</div></div>","About
PitchEasy is a creative card game for ideas that uses real products, real key phrases and adult humour. Perfect for 4 to 10 people with a playing time approx 20 to 60 minutes.
 
We've created 3 PitchEasy editions for you to choose from:

Filtered Edition​ (contains light humour) 

Perfect for professional settings, events and workshops
 
Unfiltered Edition (contains adult humour and innuendos)

Perfect for relaxed social and business settings
 
Filthy Edition (contains adult humour, innuendos and political incorrectness)

Only suitable for social settings - play at your own risk
 

 
How it works

Each round has a FundIt card that sets the pitching criteria for everyone.

The colours indicate the order in which the cards are introduced
A normal eye icon means that players are free to look at their cards before pitching
A blind icon indicates that the round is a Blind Mode: players are not allowed look at their cards - until they flip them during their pitch
A single person icon indicates that all players have to pitch individually for the round
A group icon indicates that players need to form teams and divide the cards amongst themselves and bring out a pitch together

 

Each player/team will be given a product to pitch about
 

Each players/teams are given phrases to include in their pitch.
 

Players/teams need to incorporate their cards into a pitch. it's just like comparing apples for apples - the pitch doesn't need to be perfect.
 
Here's some examples:

Study mode examples (Players allowed to look at their cards)


 
Individual pitch: Study Mode -  (Unfiltered Edition)



 
Group pitch: Study Mode (Filtered Edition)


 
Individual pitch: Study Mode (Filtered Edition)


 
 
Blind mode example (Players are not allowed to look at their cards before their pitch)
 
Individual pitch: Blind Mode (Unfiltered Edition)

 


 


After all players/teams have pitched, they vote for their favourite pitch/product  - giving their blue card to that player/team - don't vote for yourself, it's sad.
 

The aim of the game is to win the most FundIt cards, so if you have the most blue cards... you win the game and the bragging rights is all yours.

<p>We have always been fascinated by dice. Somehow we consider them as mystical objects, but all dice we've ever bought and used to play with didn't have a soul. After a walk in Vesuvius National Park, we realized that we wanted to have dice directly from Mother Earth which would be able to evoke old world feelings now lost in the traffic of the modern metropolis. So what material could be more evocative and pleasant to the touch and sight than the lava of a volcano?</p>

<p>Straight from the slopes of Vesuvius and forged one by one entirely by hand, these dice are made of lava (sculpted solid stone) and finely worked and certified by an artisan from Torre del Greco (Naples) specialist in the processing of lava.

I adored deeply strategic board games and history. You'd think these two tracks would have crossed long ago but to a great extent they haven't at all. So I set out to fill the void myself and Legendary Historia Games became reality. Over the course of the games development I found that most of the people I worked with had the same desires as myself for their gaming experiences. After months of testing and strategic refinement we've finally completed our goal by gamers for gamers. </p><h3>Who We Are</h3><h3>My name is Holden Nash the creator of Conquer the Citadel and founder of Legendary Historia Games. I've been board gaming my whole life video games just never finding a home in my heart like the tabletop feel could. You'll see this passion projected into every aspect of CTC and I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I've loved creating it. </h3><h3>The Game</h3><p>Conquer the Citadel incorporates elements of balancing power, alliances, enemies, and resources like no other board game has ever dreamed of accomplishing. All while maintaining a simple overall structure that just about anybody can understand. Take five minuets and read the rulebook, play a round and you'll be a puppet master in no time. Claim one of six political offices in the wake of political upheaval all vying to claim the palace for yourself. Play attack cards that smear your enemies and rob them of their wealth. That's just the tip of the strategic iceberg as you take your rightful place on the throne.</p><h3>Why We're Here</h3><p>Now while every element of our game has been worked out to the finest detail we still have one hole that's proven insurmountable until today. We want to give our game a more immersive feeling and to do that we need beautiful artwork that encapsulates the tone of the game while depicting your acts of political genius accurately. While we have an extremely talented artist on board with CTC it costs serious money. After all great artwork carries a hefty price tag in this case a 3000 dollar one. Once we raise the money to finish the games overall design we can workout the numbers and methods for production so we can deliver it to you. We have to take this one step at a time. Our rewards incorporate the wonderful artwork so you can get a taste of our games look to come. </p><h3>Rewards</h3><p>For your tributes to Conquer the Citadel our tiers all have something to be desired. We offer patches, stickers, t-shirts, even one sheets of the art signed by the creator. No matter how much you donate you wont be disappointed. </p><h3>Thank You </h3><p>Whether you donate to our campaign, share this video, or simply tell your friends about us maybe even all three thank you for making one of my dreams a reality.

Once we raise the money to finish the games overall design we can workout the numbers and methods for production so we can deliver it to you. We have to take this one step at a time. Our rewards incorporate the wonderful artwork so you can get a taste of our games look to come. RewardsFor your tributes to Conquer the Citadel our tiers all have something to be desired. We offer patches, stickers, t-shirts, even one sheets of the art signed by the creator. No matter how much you donate you wont be disappointed. Thank You Whether you donate to our campaign, share this video, or simply tell your friends about us maybe even all three thank you for making one of my dreams a reality. I'll see you in the Citadel!Remember Don't Inherit The Crown Conquer The Throne!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

A friend had great luck with cards that night, getting best cards over and over again. He was winning by a large margin. We, the unlucky ones, were angry.</p><p>Then someone asked if there is a card game where luck is not the main factor to win the game? A card game which enables you to win even if you get bad cards? We pondered a while and we couldn’t think of a game like that. Then there was an idea: why don’t we develop one?</p><p>And we did just that. Developing was a long process and hard work, but we also had a lot of fun and a lot of laughter.</p><p>Between November 2015 and December 2017 we organized many tests of this new card game and test players gave the game phenomenal grades. And most importantly, the test players had a lot of fun playing the game. Positive feedback and our own excitement about our card game FATE REMEDY encouraged us to start working on a crowdfunding project.</p><p>We are so happy to be here! We are also proud that we succeeded in making something positive, a card game that brings joy and laughter.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513447869/qhi1zrjikp3midwgcqor.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Don’t hesitate to talk about this project with your friends, to make a review of the game and to share the link, review or information of the Fate Remedy card game on social networks. If you follow blogs, celebrities or radio/TV/press journalists, ask them to take a look of the project or of your review of the game.

The Fate Remedy card game is different than typical card games because it is designed in a way that even if a player gets very bad cards he can still win the game. After cards/pet events are dealt you have two options:The only way to win the Fate Remedy card game is to collect the highest sum of points. To achieve this goal a player has to avoid bad events for all costs and has to hunt good events ruthlessly. Player has more options, tactics and alternatives to win (live the best possible pet life).  So fate can punish you with bad cards, but you still have a chance of winning this game or it can give you the most desired card and you will end up losing the game.  Card Deck DescriptionAs expected for a dynamic and fateful card game, the game consists of 4 main card types: - good events/cards (2 sets)- bad events/cards (two sets)- food cards (1 set)- bittersweet cards (1 set)- Sets are pictured in the upper left corner (also recognised by the color of the frame).- Numbers in icon show the value of the card in set (1 = smallest).- Card point values are printed in coin icon in the upper right corner.- Food cards and good events/cards bring positive points, bad events/cards bring negative points and bittersweet cards can surprise you with positive and negative points. How to Remedy FateThere are many options, strategies, tactics, systems and beliefs how to remedy fate. If you can make your pet happy, you are on the right path. Avoid fleas, bark in to the moon, eat moderately, do not get run over, twist your master around your finger, take pleasure in your hunting drive, etc. And if your cards are not good – punish your competitors with worst possible events. And above all never leave a good cat to others! The Game So Great That the Prototype Has Been Stolen!In the last two years more than two hundred people have tested the game. Vast majority of test players immediately loved it. Based on those test results we are very confident that a vast majority will enjoy playing the Fate Remedy card game if they will get an opportunity to play it. Most test players rated the game with an excellent rating, but one event convinced us that it was time to start the campaign.In the year 2017 the Fate Remedy card game prototype has been stolen. Stealing is a crime that can be punished with a prison sentence, but the thief has estimated the game is worth it. This fact convinced us that the time has come for the game to be presented to the world. Test FATE REMEDY Card Game for YourselfThe game is so good that we don't have to use a lot of great marketing words to sell you a ""pig in a poke"" as many other campaigns do. A lot of us haven't forgotten how dissapointed we were when we received and tested a best seller game (or games) and found out that it is dull and boring. Don't buy ""a cat in a sack"" and test our play before you decide to back our project. You can download and test print-make-and play FATE REMEDY card game edition and rules here:Download Print-make-and play FATE REMEDY editionDownload FATE REMEDY rulesAll the cards are in low resolution, black and white and single-sided.

You are more than welcome to send your review (with some photos) to our e-mail address as well.

We are confident in our ability to get Fate Ramedy cards to our backers and we will do our best to keep to timeline.We will send perks by postal service.  The Story of FATE REMEDY Card GameIt was card night in May 2012. A friend had great luck with cards that night, getting best cards over and over again. He was winning by a large margin. We, the unlucky ones, were angry.Then someone asked if there is a card game where luck is not the main factor to win the game? A card game which enables you to win even if you get bad cards? We pondered a while and we couldn’t think of a game like that. Then there was an idea: why don’t we develop one?And we did just that. Developing was a long process and hard work, but we also had a lot of fun and a lot of laughter.Between November 2015 and December 2017 we organized many tests of this new card game and test players gave the game phenomenal grades. And most importantly, the test players had a lot of fun playing the game. Positive feedback and our own excitement about our card game FATE REMEDY encouraged us to start working on a crowdfunding project.We are so happy to be here! We are also proud that we succeeded in making something positive, a card game that brings joy and laughter.Other Ways You Can HelpDon’t hesitate to talk about this project with your friends, to make a review of the game and to share the link, review or information of the Fate Remedy card game on social networks. If you follow blogs, celebrities or radio/TV/press journalists, ask them to take a look of the project or of your review of the game. Don't forget to test the free edition of the game with your friends, family and other beautiful people around you.  This would be an enormous help!Music: Daniel Alan Gautreau, License agreement/certificate No. 59477-MTR-89244 Neo soundsAll rights reserved.",19.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>It All Started When ...</h3>
<p>I accidentally wrote a 5E fantasy RPG adventure! Wanna help me print it? This is a short campaign ... it ends on June 16, 2017.<br/><br/>I started playing fantasy RPGs in 1982 at seven years old. (Yes, THAT fantasy RPG.) I accidentally stumbled into a career publishing supplements and adventures for THAT game along with designing RPG systems of my own. Check out my <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/36182.Jamie_Chambers"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Goodreads page</a> or visit <a href=""http://www.jamiechambers.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my website</a> for more info.<br/><br/>On my recent trip to Texas for a <a href=""http://www.chupacabracon.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">regional game convention</a> I scribbled out two pages worth of adventure notes for 5th Edition of the world's oldest and most popular roleplaying game (yes, THAT one) and ran a few players through it before we packed up and drove back to Atlanta.</p>

</div></div>","It All Started When ...
I accidentally wrote a 5E fantasy RPG adventure! Wanna help me print it? This is a short campaign ... it ends on June 16, 2017.I started playing fantasy RPGs in 1982 at seven years old. (Yes, THAT fantasy RPG.) I accidentally stumbled into a career publishing supplements and adventures for THAT game along with designing RPG systems of my own. Check out my Goodreads page or visit my website for more info.On my recent trip to Texas for a regional game convention I scribbled out two pages worth of adventure notes for 5th Edition of the world's oldest and most popular roleplaying game (yes, THAT one) and ran a few players through it before we packed up and drove back to Atlanta.

Then I sat down and ended up typing almost ten thousand words (26 pages worth of text in the manuscript writing program I use). I was originally thinking of posting this online via the DM's Guild, but ...

I really like it and I'd like to sell it in retail stores, not just online. I got a really talented cartographer to do the map and my illustrator I've worked with for more than a decade to draw the new monster type. It has a neat story, but is modular so it can be dropped into an existing sword & sorcery-style game or serve as the beginning of a more heroic fantasy campaign. The current plan is to assemble it as a 16-page saddle-stitched adventure module that's somewhat reminiscent of the old glory days of RPGs, but written in my voice with my own signature style.

Otherwise we'll print smaller batch of products for backers to sell directly. No matter what, everyone will get what they pay for!
What's Already Done?
There is a complete manuscript that's already been through one rewrite and independent copyediting. Anyone who backs this will get a PDF of a fully playable version of this adventure within 48 hours of the campaign coming to a close! We also have a finalized adventure map and an illustration of the new monster that's a part of the scenario.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey there, sonny! I'm BOBEYO! I'm immortal, live at the north pole, own the entire world, and all of the countries pay me taxes. And if you piss me off, I WILL KILL YOU.</p>
<p>This is a card game about me and some other idiots who don't matter, like my worthless computer hacker son Edddeyo (he added the third D when video games went 3-D), and Cocky Bob, who is my other worthless son who thinks he's cool. There's also my sort of enemy, the MOON GOD, who isn't really my enemy because I honestly don't care if he uses his army of idiots on rampage to destroy the world. That's his business. I'm too busy killing off my insane clones and avoiding my nagging wife Sueyo, who always tries to feed me $&amp;%@# Brussels sprouts.<i> I hate Brussels sprouts!</i></p>
<p>Anyway, this awesome card game is so simple even you morons could figure it out! Just draw cards out of the pile and do stuff that's written on them. If you get a full set of ""Collect 4"" cards, like Rare Cheeses or Bobeyo Clones, you win! You also win if you survive longer than anyone else by avoiding me, ANGRY BOBEYO! If you draw me, I get pissed off and kill you. Use other cards to avoid me, trick other players into drawing me, and collect the winning cards!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>It's really simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>The game is <strong>ALREADY COMPLETELY DESIGNED</strong>, barring any last-minute changes. We just need your help funding the first printing of it, so we can sell it!</li>
<li>Once it's printed, we ship your rewards! You get a copy of the card game, plus other goodies depending on your reward level! Here are some details about <strong>the rewards:</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>The Game:</strong> This is the physical card game. It consists of 56 playing cards in a fancy cardboard box with an instruction booklet!</li>
<li>
<strong>The Card:</strong> A personalized Thank You card for our top backers, signed by all 3 creators (Justin, Ryan, and Maegan), with a Bobeyo drawing by Justin just for you!</li>
<li>
<strong>The Minifigure:</strong> This is a customized LEGO® minifigure based on Bobeyo. Please note that LEGO® is a trademark of The LEGO Group, which does not sponsor, authorize, or endorse this product.</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Again, barring last-minute edits, the design phase of the game is ALREADY FINISHED! So the only problems that might arise would be from the manufacturing. We will keep our backers fully updated on manufacturing progress and any hiccups along the way. The rewards will ship to you as soon as the finished game is in our hands.</p>
<p>Why flexible funding? Because if we can't reach the full goal amount, we will just have to order fewer copies of the game than planned, or fund the rest some other way. But we WILL make this game!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't contribute, you can help by spreading the word! We always - <i>always</i> - appreciate help with promotion. Please share our campaign on social media, or just tell your friends!</p>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>If we exceed our goals, we have plenty of ideas for how to spend the extra funds! In fact, while we were designing Bobeyo, I came up with an idea for another game that I would love to get off the ground...</p>

<h2><strong>Our Story</strong></h2>
<p>Hello! Zodi-Kay here. Ash Bonnelli and I founded the <a href=""http://www.zodicollective.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ZODI [“zoh-dee”] Collective</a> to bring astrology into an whole new dimension.</p>
<p>ZODI is the first of its kind. There is no other product out there for exploring astrology and charts through a systematic deck of cards and chart diagram mat. By backing our campaign, you will be helping bring something truly unique to the astrology market: an entirely new way to discover astrology.</p>
<p>Transcend the traditional one-on-one, two-dimensional experience of astrology with ZODI. Hold it in your hands or move it around on the ZODI Map. ZODI makes exploring astrology a kinesthetic experience. Share it with friends at a dinner party, explore it with your partner on a weekend away or even bring it to work for a team-building exercise. ZODI brings astrology into real life relationships. It's now a group activity!</p>
<p>Bring your astrology readings into a new dimension, ZODI brings astro charts to life. The symbols/glyphs translated in archetypal images and color make the building blocks of astrology tangible and relatable. Birth, transit, and compatability charts, now in card form, layer and move around on the ZODI Map!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541657895/e1k4hhbrqlnwvklgjda1.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>My years of practicing psychotherapy have shown me again and again, the life-changing impact of knowing ourselves more deeply and how we fit in the larger order of things. Enriching our self-understanding in this way can make deeper connections with others possible, and allow us to bring our unique brand of positive change to the world. Ash's years of experience in the healing arts, photography and practicing astrology give her a perspective through which to see astrology and photography as conduits for healing in the world.</p>
<p>Together, Ash and I share the belief that astrology brings the unique gift of self-understanding for individuals, their relationships and communities. We feel that presenting this star theory in an entirely new, engaging and approachable format could help more people experience the benefits. We created the ZODI project from this vision.</p>
<p>After more than 14 months of business planning and development, product design and focus groups, we are ready to reach out to YOU for help funding the first production run of the ZODI Deck, Guidebook and Map! Thanks for being here. We hope you will join us in this groundbreaking campaign by pre-ordering a product perk or backing our campaign with a donation.</p>
</div><h2><strong>Our Goal</strong></h2><p>We need your help to raise $20,500.<br/>After IGG fees, these dollars will go directly to production of our initial, minimum order batch of 500 units of ZODI Decks, Guidebooks and Maps ($18,833 including taxes and sea freight shipping.)</p><p>Our ZODI products are designed to last with heavy use, and as a result we have selected high quality, durable materials. Held in the hand, the ZODI Deck's 154-card count is roughly twice the size of a Tarot deck and two to three times that of an average oracle deck. Production costs reflect the sheer size of the deck, the number of products we're batch producing (deck, guidebook and map) and the durable materials used. Although our goal is significant, it is the minimum necessary to successfully bring our first edition of the ZODI collection to market.</p><p>To date, we've invested just under $21,000 in resources to develop the business foundation - form our corporation and secure US trademark registration, design our brand and ZODI products and launch our ecommerce website.</p><p>With this campaign, we are reaching out to you, the Indiegogo community, to boost our efforts and help take ZODI the final step of the way.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541659984/vost9iysg9g3h6xkdq2p.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h2> </h2><h2><strong>ZODI Perks!</strong></h2><p>Our perks are the ZODI products themselves.

We are both passionate about deepening the greater understanding of astrology and have put significant time and resources into setting ZODI up for success.</p><p>We have galvanized ZODI with protections for our brand design and products through US trademark registration, and operations for the business as a licensed corporation.

Hello! Zodi-Kay here. Ash Bonnelli and I founded the ZODI [“zoh-dee”] Collective to bring astrology into an whole new dimension.
ZODI is the first of its kind. There is no other product out there for exploring astrology and charts through a systematic deck of cards and chart diagram mat. By backing our campaign, you will be helping bring something truly unique to the astrology market: an entirely new way to discover astrology.
Transcend the traditional one-on-one, two-dimensional experience of astrology with ZODI. Hold it in your hands or move it around on the ZODI Map. ZODI makes exploring astrology a kinesthetic experience. Share it with friends at a dinner party, explore it with your partner on a weekend away or even bring it to work for a team-building exercise. ZODI brings astrology into real life relationships. It's now a group activity!
Bring your astrology readings into a new dimension, ZODI brings astro charts to life. The symbols/glyphs translated in archetypal images and color make the building blocks of astrology tangible and relatable. Birth, transit, and compatability charts, now in card form, layer and move around on the ZODI Map!
 

 
My years of practicing psychotherapy have shown me again and again, the life-changing impact of knowing ourselves more deeply and how we fit in the larger order of things. Enriching our self-understanding in this way can make deeper connections with others possible, and allow us to bring our unique brand of positive change to the world. Ash's years of experience in the healing arts, photography and practicing astrology give her a perspective through which to see astrology and photography as conduits for healing in the world.
Together, Ash and I share the belief that astrology brings the unique gift of self-understanding for individuals, their relationships and communities. We feel that presenting this star theory in an entirely new, engaging and approachable format could help more people experience the benefits. We created the ZODI project from this vision.
After more than 14 months of business planning and development, product design and focus groups, we are ready to reach out to YOU for help funding the first production run of the ZODI Deck, Guidebook and Map! Thanks for being here. We hope you will join us in this groundbreaking campaign by pre-ordering a product perk or backing our campaign with a donation.
Our GoalWe need your help to raise $20,500.After IGG fees, these dollars will go directly to production of our initial, minimum order batch of 500 units of ZODI Decks, Guidebooks and Maps ($18,833 including taxes and sea freight shipping.)Our ZODI products are designed to last with heavy use, and as a result we have selected high quality, durable materials. Held in the hand, the ZODI Deck's 154-card count is roughly twice the size of a Tarot deck and two to three times that of an average oracle deck. Production costs reflect the sheer size of the deck, the number of products we're batch producing (deck, guidebook and map) and the durable materials used. Although our goal is significant, it is the minimum necessary to successfully bring our first edition of the ZODI collection to market.To date, we've invested just under $21,000 in resources to develop the business foundation - form our corporation and secure US trademark registration, design our brand and ZODI products and launch our ecommerce website.With this campaign, we are reaching out to you, the Indiegogo community, to boost our efforts and help take ZODI the final step of the way.  ZODI Perks!Our perks are the ZODI products themselves. Check them out in more detail on the sidebar, but below is a brief overview.We are offering our early supporters special pricing on our ZODI Bundle (Deck, Guidebook and Map) for the first 48 hours of the campaign, and Ultimate ZODI Collection (Deck, Guidebook, Map and Tote) for the duration of the campaign.The ZODI Deck is a brand-new way to experience your astrology. Get to know yourself through exploration of your planets and their relationships with one another. Discover themes and energies that lie ahead through exploring transit charts. Illuminate relationship potentials, strengths and challenges through exploration of astro compatibility with your closest people. ZODI makes all of this tangible. Included with the deck, our ZODI Guidebook contains gems of information about the components of astrology and guidance on how to use your deck.The ZODI Map (sold separately) is an invaluable tool for using your cards to bring astrological charts to life. Birth charts, transit charts, compatibility charts…It all happens on our 24”x24” soft rubber, non-slip mat with a smooth surface printed with the zodiac wheel. It the perfect foundation for exploration!We have also created the ZODI Tote (sold separately) for all your ZODI gear. This mid-weight, gusseted canvas tote bag holds it all. Have Tote...ZODI will travel!If you’d like to experience ZODI with its creators, we’re offering a couple special perks: ZODI astrology readings with Ash, and ZODI parties, where we will come to your house and lead fun ZODI experiences with you and six of your friends - each person receives a deck and guidebook.The traditional astro reading...The ZODI astro reading! Why is ZODI worth backing?ZODI is the first of its kind.There is no other product out there for exploring astrology and charts through a systematic deck of cards and chart diagram mat. By backing our campaign, you will be helping bring something truly unique to the astrology market.ZODI is engaging for all.The ZODI format will make learning more about astrology interactive and fun for beginners, and bring a new dimension to professional astrological readings, coaching sessions, or even organizational team building workshops. Whether you're an astro novice or seasoned professional, ZODI has something illuminating to offer.  
ZODI can foster self-discovery and connection with others.Astrology is a theory - a system - through which we can find meaning in our lives, discover more about ourselves and bridge connections between ourselves and others. Our goal in creating ZODI is to bring this star theory to more people and experience oneself through its fascinating lens.  Risks & ChallengesBeing the first of its kind, ZODI doesn’t have truly comparable competitor products. However, in exploring other card deck (Tarot and oracle deck) crowd fund campaigns, our funding goal is higher than most.Having put the time, work and resources toward creating ZODI's business foundations and completing the design and branding, the ZODI collection is complete and ready for production. We have jumped many hurdles and put our plans in place for going forward.The main remaining hurdle we foresee will be raising the funds necessary for our initial production batch. We need your help to get there! Why We Can SucceedWe are uniquely poised to launch ZODI.I have launched two successful businesses over the past 12 years (a psychotherapy private practice and web design business) while Ash has launched her own business as a practicing astrologer, has 15+ years experience in the healing arts and endless creativity. We are both passionate about deepening the greater understanding of astrology and have put significant time and resources into setting ZODI up for success.We have galvanized ZODI with protections for our brand design and products through US trademark registration, and operations for the business as a licensed corporation. In addition to these solid business and legal foundations necessary to launch our ZODI products, we have focused earnestly on building a trusted and compelling brand reputation.Our well-framed general business plan, as well as specific development and promotional plans for 2019 and beyond, inform our stages as we learn and dynamically grow the ZODI enterprise.We are committed to continually learning what is needed to create, launch, bring to market and maintain a thriving product. We are also willing to put in the work necessary to make these things happen.Ways We’ve Mitigated RiskWe've followed Indiegogo’s recommendations for launching and managing a successful campaign. We gathered an advisory committee that served as a focus group for our ZODI products and business plan; the group also provided strategic support for this campaign. We have reinforcements!We have also spent several months developing our brand and reputation on social media platforms and realized an audience that fits into the larger communities of astrology, philosophy and healing arts. We are ready to engage these communities in reaching our goal! What if this campaign falls short of its goal?If we don’t reach our campaign goal, the fundraising doesn’t end here.

Short Summary

Do you want to have a unique army with a non-generic theme?

Not another orc-elf-human army...

You do not wish to spend a lot on the army?
We might have a solution for you.

Couple of years ago I saw an army made of simple rocks. I liked it a lot, but I wanted more than stones with painted on eyes. I started to tinker about this idea and after many years, the idea is now a real thing. 
First I wanted the rock army just for myself along with my own ideas. I wanted to use them for Warhammer Fantasy and Kings of War.
First I wanted to do them from real stones, but then I met someone who was proficient in sculpting and who also loved the idea of living rocks. 
Several people told me, that if I do the army with him, why not share with others too? As I am good at resin casting, now I open the opportunity for others too via the crowdfunding campaign.




Who we areI am Daniel. I already participated in several campaings already as resin caster. I work with resin and you can see lot of my work on my FB page.www.facebook.com/sebitarworkshopwww.facebook.com/28mmrockarmy

<p> Hi there! I'm Sam Milham, an illustrator working in the toy industry in Melbourne doing what I love, and in my spare time I draw things.</p>
<p>This will be my third Kickstarter, having Kickstarted a successful card game, 'Fairy God Plumber' last year which was delivered to backers all across the world, and before that, an art book.</p>
<p>I have just finished working on Spaceship Zoo, a hilarious card game for all ages (but great for parents or uncles/aunties to play with their kids) and I can't wait to share it with more awesome people just like you.</p>
<p>I've had the pleasure to be published on a range of awesome websites with a small selection below:</p>

<p>We have our awesome manufacturer lined up and we’ll begin printing the cards as soon as we’re funded. The cards will be printed on 56 poker-sized cards with a full colour printed tuckbox for security. Here is a general timeline from now until your Spaceship Zoo cards arrive.  </p>

<h2>Hello and Welcome To Monsters of Nature Featuring the Steam Pod!</h2>
<p>We are Real Game FX. With the help of a little mad science we create marvelous machines that add special effects to tabletop games for the most immersive experience possible. We are owned and operated in the USA and have been designing and selling electronic components since 2005.</p>
<p>Last year backers helped us make a really cool fog machine for tabletop games called the <a href=""https://www.realgamefx.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Fog Monster""</a>. This year we bring you the monstrous power of Steam in our new battery operated ""Steam Pod"". We have also created a few terrain pieces that use the Steam Pod for awesome FX. We hope you will support us in this effort to make tabletop gaming as realistic and immersive as possible.   </p>
</div><h3>Introducing The Steam Pod</h3><p> The Steam Pod offers almost zero water condensation, especially when used vertically.  You can even aim the LEDs inside to light up the Steam with color. And it's gamer friendly, no foul smelling oil only pure water. How awesome is that?</p><p><strong>Battery no longer required!</strong> The Steam Pod can now be operated using any of the following power sources:</p><p>1. A Li-Po battery. </p><p>2. A AAA or AA Power Bank.</p><p>3. A Li-ion Power Bank.</p><p>4. A USB Cord directly plugged into the Steam Pod with no battery.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul>
<li>Colorless - Will not stain or leave an oily residue on your terrain. </li>
<li>Odorless - No unpleasant burning smell. </li>
<li>Runs on water - No expensive formula or ""juice"" to purchase. </li>
<li>Instant - Steam begins when it's turned on.</li>
<li>Continuous on or Puffer mode, (Puffer turns on and off every 8 seconds like a geyser)</li>
<li>Comes with 2 Red LEDs in the cap to create colored fog! (LEDs are plugs so you can use your own LEDs to change colors.)</li>
<li>Battery: Works with any 3.7v Li-Po battery with Connector Type: 2P 2.0mm Pitch.  633048 900mAh recommended. Max battery length 63mm. Max width 34mm (battery not included) </li>
<li>Battery charges by plugging a Micro USB plug into the Steam Pod from a 5v power supply. Battery available on <a href=""http://www.realgamefx.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.realgamefx.com</a> website, Amazon, or Ebay.</li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Smart Game Host.</strong> The Outsmarted AI host runs the show for you! Just choose your teams, select which question packs you'd like, and if you need to keep the game time within a certain limit, let the game's AI do the rest!</p></li>
<li>
<strong>Fantastic Team / Party Mode</strong>. Supporting up to 6 teams of 4 players (24 players). But beware - even in team mode, Outsmarted sometimes selects one member of the team for an important solo question.  </li>
</ul>
<ul><li>
<strong>Remote Play. </strong>Outsmarted is the first board game DESIGNED to support remote play. Perfect in these times when friends and family cannot always be together.  Even better is that only YOU need to own the game - your friends and family can use the FREE Outsmarted app to join your game!</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<strong>Localised Questions.</strong> The questions in Outsmarted are dependent on the region that you select within the software. At launch the US, British, Canadian and International English versions will be available with further foreign language versions in 2021. </li></ul>
<ul><li>
<strong>Play it your way.</strong> Outsmarted is as much fun with just 2 players as it is with a huge team of 24! Play it with your Windows laptop, an iPad, Android tablet or mobile phone. You can share just one device or connect a second or third as well as up to 6 mobiles as handheld controllers (one for each player or team).    </li></ul>
<ul><li>
<strong>Almost no learning curve.</strong> Outsmarted has almost no learning curve.  The AI hosts the show.  It always knows who's turn it is and which IQ Rings each player / team has collected. Anyone in the family can play straight away.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<strong>Questions by professional question writers. </strong>To make sure we have the best content on the planet, we have a small team of highly experienced question writers that have been involved in major TV show question writing.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>A lifetime of free updates.</b> Outsmarted is the world's first board game that constantly evolves with new surprises and great free new content on a regular basis. It means it never gets boring like other board games tend to over time!</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<strong>In-game leaderboard. </strong>The in game leaderboard at the end of each round shows the positions of all players / teams. It also shows correct answer percentages for each player / team.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<strong>The 3D Genius Miniatures. </strong>We have put a lot of effort into the design of the 3D painted miniature genius characters that feature in Outsmarted and they're adorable as a result!! You can see the full line up below with more to come in future versions.  Got an idea for a new 'Genius'?  Drop us a line with your nominee!  </li></ul>
<ul><li>
<strong>The Question Store. </strong>Outsmarted includes enough questions for hundreds of hours of play. If you need more questions or just want to customise the game with questions about topics you love - no worries!  The Question Store gives you instant access to an amazing library of additional content for free or low cost. </li></ul>

<p>There's more than one way to play Outsmarted! From intimate two-player games with just an iPad to the real Game Show experience on a big screen TV.  Which one are you?</p>
<p><strong>The Purist - </strong>The purist has trouble letting go of that dusty old question pack, but soon realizes Outsmarted is just.. A lot better!  So they opt for intimate candle-lit iPad sessions (with the volume set low), playing with their partner or perhaps even a guest or two on very special occasions.</p>
<p><strong>The Family Guy - </strong>The family guy (or girl!) understands Outsmarted is the perfect way to get the whole family involved. They have struggled to find a game that everyone enjoys playing and their kids spend more time glued to their phone than reality. But with Outsmarted everyone's happy and can compete together, best of all... Their kids are learning without even knowing it!   </p>
<p><strong>The Frenemy  - </strong>The frenemy is your best friend until they get around a table with a board game. They suddenly become uber competitive. They are prone to sending invites weeks in advance - ""How about Outsmarted three weeks on Saturday?"". They make sure their new iPhone 12 is fully charged before the game starts, because they somehow believe all that processing power and a full battery gives them an edge.    </p>
<p><strong>The Show Off - </strong>The show off streams Outsmarted to their 4K projector with their 8 speaker Dolby Digital setup providing an arena-like atmosphere, maximizing the video and audio-based question experience. They place a large leather chair in front of the screen and everyone has to take the hot-seat during their turn with a spotlight shining down on them for extra pressure! </p>
<p><strong>The Control Freak -</strong> The control freak runs Outsmarted on their Windows laptop and streams their laptop screen to the TV. They then act as a TV show host using their mouse to control the game. They can be heard frequently saying ""Is that your FINAL answer?"" &amp; ""That's the WRONG answer!""</p>
<p><strong>The Party Animal - </strong>The party animal invites everyone over for a mass team game of Outsmarted. Rounding up 6 teams of 4 players (24 total)! They also have a giant trophy for the winners and an endless supply of drinks and snacks on hand.    </p>

<p>This category is about pure Trivia.  The questions are similar to those you might find in old school trivia games or quizzes. Crazy facts, unusual events, things you should've known and things you didn't know you knew!      </p>

<p>No self-respecting Quiz Show would be complete without a category covering TV, Film &amp; Books. What's great about Outsmarted is that many of the questions in this section include photos and video clips!     </p>

<p>And of course we haven't forgotten Music!  In addition to Musical themed trivia and specialist knowledge, we hope to have finalised a licensing deal by the time of launch which permits us to offer ""name that tune"" sound questions.      </p>

<p>Outsmarted includes 2,500+ multimedia questions. Perfect for hours and hours of play. This already exceeds the number of most 'card' questions provided by our traditional board game competitors, so in theory, the average player shouldn't feel the need for additional questions for a long time.  But if you do get the itch for something new... </p>
<p>The in-game Question Store is there for you!  It's a world first.. being able to expand your board game and add exciting new content for years to come with one swipe.  We'll also introduce entirely new question categories!</p>
<p>So what does this mean for you?     </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602536714/vjeifetabhldcqmuq8ma.png"" src=""""/></p>

<ul><li>
<strong>Focus.</strong> A lot of questions are designed to leave you with no time to think. Complete focus is needed from the first second of the countdown to give you the best possible chance. </li></ul>
<ul><li>
<strong>Know when to use an assist. </strong>If you go out all guns blazing with your assists, you won’t have any in reserve for the crucial ring questions. Likewise, if a question comes with a significant surprise bonus, it’s often worth using an assist or two to nail that question and grab the bonus.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<strong>Stay goal oriented.</strong> For example, when playing a fixed time-length game of 60 minutes and there is a tie for first place, the winner could be decided by the number of assists each player has remaining when the time is up.  So conserve your assists in a fixed-time match - unless you’re going all in on a ring question.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<strong>Make quick decisions. </strong>Quite often it’s clear that one, or two possible answers are definitely wrong.  When under pressure, quick decisions to eliminate these is often the difference between winning and losing. </li></ul>
<ul><li>
<strong>Plot your path. </strong>Going for your strongest categories can be a good idea in a fixed time game of 30 or 60 minutes. And if possible, memorize the 'roll again' opportunities so you don't miss them.         </li></ul>

</div></div>","Finally! A 21st Century Board Game...

That's Christmas 2020!! 
There are two fantastic versions of Outsmarted available on Indiegogo, offering a $10 - $15 discount on the future retail price of Outsmarted. More importantly, if won't be in stores until April 2021, Get your copy today, whilst stock lasts. You can choose between the:

Outsmarted Retail Edition ($35)
Outsmarted Limited Edition ($45)

Once you have your game, gather round the TV and/ or the tablet and get the home board game + quiz show experience, the 21st Century demands! With questions based on the age of your team members and interactive video-based questions, it'll be an interactive experience for the whole family to enjoy in Christmas 2020!




 
Outsmarted means no one player, of any age, has an unfair advantage over the competition! With 2,500+ questions, and more added daily, including video-based questions, that can be streamed to your TV, what better way is there to spend Christmas 2020! You can EVEN play remotely with friends & family, as long as they have the app!
 

    Outsmarted Features - The New Era of Board Games!

Smart Game Host. The Outsmarted AI host runs the show for you! Just choose your teams, select which question packs you'd like, and if you need to keep the game time within a certain limit, let the game's AI do the rest!

Fantastic Team / Party Mode. Supporting up to 6 teams of 4 players (24 players). But beware - even in team mode, Outsmarted sometimes selects one member of the team for an important solo question.  


Remote Play. Outsmarted is the first board game DESIGNED to support remote play. Perfect in these times when friends and family cannot always be together.  Even better is that only YOU need to own the game - your friends and family can use the FREE Outsmarted app to join your game!

Localised Questions. The questions in Outsmarted are dependent on the region that you select within the software. At launch the US, British, Canadian and International English versions will be available with further foreign language versions in 2021. 

Play it your way. Outsmarted is as much fun with just 2 players as it is with a huge team of 24! Play it with your Windows laptop, an iPad, Android tablet or mobile phone. You can share just one device or connect a second or third as well as up to 6 mobiles as handheld controllers (one for each player or team).    

Almost no learning curve. Outsmarted has almost no learning curve.  The AI hosts the show.  It always knows who's turn it is and which IQ Rings each player / team has collected. Anyone in the family can play straight away.

Questions by professional question writers. To make sure we have the best content on the planet, we have a small team of highly experienced question writers that have been involved in major TV show question writing.

A lifetime of free updates. Outsmarted is the world's first board game that constantly evolves with new surprises and great free new content on a regular basis. It means it never gets boring like other board games tend to over time!

In-game leaderboard. The in game leaderboard at the end of each round shows the positions of all players / teams. It also shows correct answer percentages for each player / team.

The 3D Genius Miniatures. We have put a lot of effort into the design of the 3D painted miniature genius characters that feature in Outsmarted and they're adorable as a result!! You can see the full line up below with more to come in future versions.  Got an idea for a new 'Genius'?  Drop us a line with your nominee!  

The Question Store. Outsmarted includes enough questions for hundreds of hours of play. If you need more questions or just want to customise the game with questions about topics you love - no worries!  The Question Store gives you instant access to an amazing library of additional content for free or low cost. 


There's more than one way to play Outsmarted! From intimate two-player games with just an iPad to the real Game Show experience on a big screen TV.  Which one are you?
The Purist - The purist has trouble letting go of that dusty old question pack, but soon realizes Outsmarted is just.. A lot better!  So they opt for intimate candle-lit iPad sessions (with the volume set low), playing with their partner or perhaps even a guest or two on very special occasions.
The Family Guy - The family guy (or girl!) understands Outsmarted is the perfect way to get the whole family involved. They have struggled to find a game that everyone enjoys playing and their kids spend more time glued to their phone than reality. But with Outsmarted everyone's happy and can compete together, best of all... Their kids are learning without even knowing it!   
The Frenemy  - The frenemy is your best friend until they get around a table with a board game. They suddenly become uber competitive. They are prone to sending invites weeks in advance - ""How about Outsmarted three weeks on Saturday?"". They make sure their new iPhone 12 is fully charged before the game starts, because they somehow believe all that processing power and a full battery gives them an edge.    
The Show Off - The show off streams Outsmarted to their 4K projector with their 8 speaker Dolby Digital setup providing an arena-like atmosphere, maximizing the video and audio-based question experience. They place a large leather chair in front of the screen and everyone has to take the hot-seat during their turn with a spotlight shining down on them for extra pressure! 
The Control Freak - The control freak runs Outsmarted on their Windows laptop and streams their laptop screen to the TV. They then act as a TV show host using their mouse to control the game. They can be heard frequently saying ""Is that your FINAL answer?"" & ""That's the WRONG answer!""
The Party Animal - The party animal invites everyone over for a mass team game of Outsmarted. Rounding up 6 teams of 4 players (24 total)! They also have a giant trophy for the winners and an endless supply of drinks and snacks on hand.    

In Outsmarted there are six Ring Categories, each representing a unique challenge that you will have to master.  Land on a Ring Question and answer it correctly - you win that Ring. Collect all 6 Rings to reach the Final Round.      

Raw brain power.. this category involves observation, logic, reasoning, pattern recognition and sometimes a bit of quick arithmetic.  The catch is...  it's all against the clock!        

This category is about all the things you could or probably should have learned at school. Questions cover - History, Geography, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, English Language and Mathematics.       
 
If it happened yesterday it could be featured in the game today! New content is added to the Breaking News category daily. Questions cover World News, Celebrity News, Regional News, Political News, Tech news, Scientific News and Environmental News.       

This category is about pure Trivia.  The questions are similar to those you might find in old school trivia games or quizzes. Crazy facts, unusual events, things you should've known and things you didn't know you knew!      

No self-respecting Quiz Show would be complete without a category covering TV, Film & Books. What's great about Outsmarted is that many of the questions in this section include photos and video clips!     

And of course we haven't forgotten Music!  In addition to Musical themed trivia and specialist knowledge, we hope to have finalised a licensing deal by the time of launch which permits us to offer ""name that tune"" sound questions.      

Outsmarted includes 2,500+ multimedia questions. Perfect for hours and hours of play. This already exceeds the number of most 'card' questions provided by our traditional board game competitors, so in theory, the average player shouldn't feel the need for additional questions for a long time.  But if you do get the itch for something new... 
The in-game Question Store is there for you!  It's a world first.. being able to expand your board game and add exciting new content for years to come with one swipe.  We'll also introduce entirely new question categories!
So what does this mean for you?     

More Questions whenever you need them!
If you play a lot, you will eventually require more questions.  With all of our cardboard competitors, that's game over...  But not with Outsmarted!  We can provide you with an entire new game's worth of questions in an instant... And at a fraction of the price of buying a new game!   
An entire Core Question Pack of 2,500+ Questions is available in-game from only $8.99 / $11.99. Incredible value!  Incredible longevity!    
Get the question categories YOU WANT!
The questions categories in Outsmarted are great, but If you ever want more of the kind of questions you really love, you can get them instantly in the Question Store. 
Add Specialty Question Packs to the existing library of questions so they are added into the mix, or you can switch out a whole category you don't want and replace it with your chosen pack.  What's more, you can do this on a game-by-game basis... In seconds.
Don't like Breaking News... Switch it for the 1990's.  
Don't like Back to School... Switch it for Sports! 
In fact.. you can customize all the categories to your chosen subjects, should you wish!
Eventually, hundreds of Speciality Question Packs will be available, some are completely FREE OF CHARGE and others will start at only S2.99 / $3.99 for lifetime ownership.   
If you have a suggestion for a question pack you would like to see in the future get in touch and tell us!

<p><strong>A note from our founder:</strong></p>
<p>Hi. I’m Bryce Brown, the board game designer for Rescuing Robin Hood. After working 6 years in pricing, finance, and marketing at Caterpillar and TDS Telecom, I decided to take a year off from work to serve the homeless, learn Spanish, and grow in my faith. In July 2019 I began my sabbatical. It has been a fruitful time of helping many and I am now conversational in Spanish!</p>
<p>Out of this time I also started designing a board game called Rescuing Robin Hood. Playtesting has been very successful. Only 1 of the first 30 people who played the game did not have fun playing it, and it has brought a lot of joy to people. Seeing the way that my game brought life and laughter to so many people, I decided in March 2020 to incorporate Castillo Games (named in honor of my grandmother) to publish my game with a vision of bringing joy to thousands of people across the world.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1592586181/qy2iqifucze9xb1bsmh8.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>I also see this business as a way of giving back to the community.

</div></div>","Rescuing Robin Hood is a new collaborative deck-building game. Work together using your Wit, Stealth, Brawn and even your Jolliness to rescue the villagers from the Sheriff of Nottingham’s men. Once you have built up your Merry Band, select your dream team, storm the castle, and fight one final battle to rescue Robin Hood! Our talented illustrator, Paul Vermeesch, has worked incredibly hard on the art behind this exciting game. Help support Paul and the team at Castillo Games to finish this journey, and you’ll get stickers, posters, and an online version of the game in return!
This board game art sponsorship is the first of its kind. Our dream is to create a model that allows fans of the art and the game to be involved early on in the developmental stages in order to make games that are truly fantastic. Through your support both financially and by providing your feedback on our Tabletopia version, you can be a part of making this game incredible! If this model catches on, it could transform board game art across the industry!
Each character has a story. Meet Agnes Daisy and Fyrmyn. 

These characters fearlessly lead the Merry Band in their attempt to rescue Robin!
A note from our founder:
Hi. I’m Bryce Brown, the board game designer for Rescuing Robin Hood. After working 6 years in pricing, finance, and marketing at Caterpillar and TDS Telecom, I decided to take a year off from work to serve the homeless, learn Spanish, and grow in my faith. In July 2019 I began my sabbatical. It has been a fruitful time of helping many and I am now conversational in Spanish!
Out of this time I also started designing a board game called Rescuing Robin Hood. Playtesting has been very successful. Only 1 of the first 30 people who played the game did not have fun playing it, and it has brought a lot of joy to people. Seeing the way that my game brought life and laughter to so many people, I decided in March 2020 to incorporate Castillo Games (named in honor of my grandmother) to publish my game with a vision of bringing joy to thousands of people across the world.

I also see this business as a way of giving back to the community. After thinking through the business need and the current difficult employment situation, I decided to hire a number of people to work part-time at Castillo Games. They have done an incredible job and I am very grateful for them. I would love to hire them full time and increase their pay, but I need your help!

Obviously it is not always easy to please everyone, but we do our best. We have therefore set only a few Stretch goals at the moment, but they can change during the campaign, so we are open to your proposals that you can see added to your pledge. MiniatureScenicMiniature MiniatureScenicAnother small update for our beloved backers!We followed one of your suggestions and we created an alternative piece for the crypts.Ruined and partially collapsed roofs, to give a more sinister appearance to your graveyard.MiniatureStill a small addition, following one of your suggestions here is our interpretation of the nightmare.ScenicSome simple elements but I think they will please many of you.of the ruins of a circular building.And broken tombstones.MiniatureOne more miniature for you.A necromancer or an exorcist if you prefer, we really like this miniature, what do you think?Scenic A funeral scene, with the coffin about to be dropped into the grave, while the second is the same tomb a few nights later! but with surprise!ScenicA bell fallen to the ground coming from some kind of abandoned bell tower.ScenicAs you suggested we created a chapel, which can be used where space is not sufficient to insert the cathedral with its bell tower.ScenicA small bridge in our usual style.We did not want to make a very large bridge with buildings above or very long.We thought that our sculptures are ideal for building wargame and exterior scenarios, and we believe it is extremely difficult to place a large bridge together with all our other sculptures.So we made a bridge that crosses a ditch or a stream.MiniatureA plague doctor who wanders in the cemetery with bad intentions!ScenicThe house of the watchman, we have created this very versatile and compact house that you can easily insert in your scenarios.MiniatureScenicSo here is the last sculpture for you that we decided to add: the requests were many, many beautiful ideas, but in the end we decided to make a well, we consider it a characteristic element that is good with the rest of the scenics in over a medium-sized piece that you can easily place within your landscapes.Crosslances studios is founded by 3 artists and their commons passion for the world of games. Students at the Comics courses in Florence, made by the greebo games sculptures, they approached the world of miniatures. It has actually became a revelant studio in the world of miniatures and digital miniatures prototyping. Our products can be found in many places, we had collaborations with: Labmasu, Megalith Godslayer, Hidden Dreams, Minuteman miniatures, Fireforge , and many others  Risks and challengesCrosslances is a dynamic studio researching for innovation, our challenge is to renew ourselves by renewing our opening game, hoping it could give us a good lift. We hope the world will always be more prepared to our little revolution: bringing 3D printable games into houses. Risks for customers are minimal, with a good preparation with your own 3D printer, it will impossible to have problems. Biggest difficulties are found in supports positioning, in fact printing quality of complex objects can be improved wit adequate supports.",69.0,0,"6 Campaigns

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>There is something magical about toys. Inspiration, imagination, and wonder machines that return us to a brighter time and bring some of our wildest dreams to reality! However, it has never been enough for me to just be a toy collector or appreciator. I have always wanted to create. To flush out my own ideas into the three dimensional world. Enter 3D printing!</p>
<p>In 2015 I purchased my first 3D printer as a kit and hand built the machine more or less as a personal science project. The build looked nice and printed fairly well but was a bit unreliable, and the hobby was still fairly expensive in both cost and time.</p>
<p>So it went to the back burner until 2018 when I was randomly gifted with a 3D printing pen that was still on back-order. Even without the machine in hand it immediately triggered my past curiosities and I began researching the new printers out there and a short time later found myself with a newer, full factory made printer!</p>
<p>I had originally designed the concept for DRAUGHTNAUTS in 2015 but could not accurately print them till I had this newer machine, and the machine just happened to be perfect for printing the parts needed to make these figurines! Long story short the new machine printed so well I just had to get two more to print more figurines faster! And I began thinking of variant color schemes, and helmets and weapons! And each new idea seemed totally possible and I got that amazing sense of magic I felt when I was a kid! That’s when it dawned on me to create the game. That I could create something that everyone could enjoy and hopefully bring back that feeling to others. That return to a playful magic, that feeling of something new!</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Breaking Down the Costs</h3>
<p>So lets get down to business. This is obviously a crowdfunding campaign which means we are looking to the community for help in getting to our next goal, of being able to fully mass produce this game and supply it to our eager fans!</p>
<p>Here's what we need. We are looking to raise <strong>$7500</strong> in order to kick our little start-up into full gear. Here's how we break down the costs.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539023697/a9ibtes8b7evpa6cwncm.png"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>1/4 of the funds will go to buying the rest of the printers and filament we need to get to full mass production. With only 3 printers right now we are only running at about 1/3 our capabilities. With the new additions we speed up production by 50%!</li>
<li>1/4 of the funds go to the packaging and the other design elements. This allows us to get all the raw elements and machinery to create the packaging, literature, and game boards in house, saving our customers in the final retail costs.</li>
<li>1/4 of the funds goes to the completion of our studio workshop! We've got a lot accomplished already but we still need the proper finishing and furniture before we can move in and begin full production!</li>
<li>And the final 1/4 of the funds will address the legal costs, fees associated with creating the business, as well as crowdfunding costs.</li>
</ul>

</div></div>","Our Story
There is something magical about toys. Inspiration, imagination, and wonder machines that return us to a brighter time and bring some of our wildest dreams to reality! However, it has never been enough for me to just be a toy collector or appreciator. I have always wanted to create. To flush out my own ideas into the three dimensional world. Enter 3D printing!
In 2015 I purchased my first 3D printer as a kit and hand built the machine more or less as a personal science project. The build looked nice and printed fairly well but was a bit unreliable, and the hobby was still fairly expensive in both cost and time.
So it went to the back burner until 2018 when I was randomly gifted with a 3D printing pen that was still on back-order. Even without the machine in hand it immediately triggered my past curiosities and I began researching the new printers out there and a short time later found myself with a newer, full factory made printer!
I had originally designed the concept for DRAUGHTNAUTS in 2015 but could not accurately print them till I had this newer machine, and the machine just happened to be perfect for printing the parts needed to make these figurines! Long story short the new machine printed so well I just had to get two more to print more figurines faster! And I began thinking of variant color schemes, and helmets and weapons! And each new idea seemed totally possible and I got that amazing sense of magic I felt when I was a kid! That’s when it dawned on me to create the game. That I could create something that everyone could enjoy and hopefully bring back that feeling to others. That return to a playful magic, that feeling of something new!
 

Breaking Down the Costs
So lets get down to business. This is obviously a crowdfunding campaign which means we are looking to the community for help in getting to our next goal, of being able to fully mass produce this game and supply it to our eager fans!
Here's what we need. We are looking to raise $7500 in order to kick our little start-up into full gear. Here's how we break down the costs.


1/4 of the funds will go to buying the rest of the printers and filament we need to get to full mass production. With only 3 printers right now we are only running at about 1/3 our capabilities. With the new additions we speed up production by 50%!
1/4 of the funds go to the packaging and the other design elements. This allows us to get all the raw elements and machinery to create the packaging, literature, and game boards in house, saving our customers in the final retail costs.
1/4 of the funds goes to the completion of our studio workshop! We've got a lot accomplished already but we still need the proper finishing and furniture before we can move in and begin full production!
And the final 1/4 of the funds will address the legal costs, fees associated with creating the business, as well as crowdfunding costs.

 
What You Get
Let's talk about donation rewards!

Our tier 1 Street Team level donation of $20 will get you a bumper sticker, 2 base character stickers, and a coupon for 25% off a retail full set.
 

Our tier 2 Gamer level donation of $50 gets you a full set of Draughtnauts, a bumper sticker, and a coupon for 25% off a retail expansion set!**
 

For a $100 donation you'll enter into our Super Fan tier! You'll get a full set of Draughtnauts plus a designer t-shirt*, as well as a bumper sticker, and 2 coupons for 25% off retail expansion sets.**
 


Our 4th tier is appropriately called the Collector tier! For your donation of $250 you will get everything we will be offering once we launch. You'll get the full set, an expansion set, a t-shirt*, a bumper sticker, 2 base color stickers, and 50% another retail expansion set. But you'll also be one of the first people to receive our expansion game board, the Mega Board which also includes an additional Standard Board of your choice (*see below for choices).
 


CHOOSE CUSTOM EXPANSION
COLOR AND NAME!!
 
And finally we have the mega lode! The Draughtnaut General tier! For a donation of $450 you become a Draughtnaut master with 2 Full sets, 2 expansion sets, 2 t-shirts*, the bumper sticker and the base color stickers, 2 coupons for 50% off retail expansion sets as well as 25% off another full set, a Mega Board with 2 additional Standard Boards of your choice (*see below for choices), and you even get to choose the color scheme and name of the next expansion line! But lets keep it G rated!
 
*You will be contacted by email after donating to select your T-Shirt size (Tier 3, 4 & 5), your standard board choice (Tier 4 & 5), and color/name of your choice (Tier 5).
**Tier 2 and Tier 3 donations will be charged a flat rate for 1-3 day priority shipping.  Free shipping for Tiers 1, 4, & 5!
Tier 4 and 5 Standard Board options!

<p>Welcome to the 27th volume of Dimgaard's DnD adventures. Thanks for the consideration. These are PDFs delivered through our proprietary document management system. If you want to see what a Dimgaard adventure module looks like, samples of the opening chapters in the two current campaigns (Patron Wars and Encounters with Gold) are available at <a href=""http://www.dimgaard.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.dimgaard.com</a> – as well as other information about the Dimgaard setting - including other free modules from past campaigns.</p>
<p>We would note the six principles that Dimgaard builds its adventures around (each of which is elaborated on at <a href=""http://www.dimgaard.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.dimgaard.com</a>):  </p>
<ul>
<li>A strong story.   </li>
<li>Strict adherence to Rules As Written (RAW). </li>
<li>Largest set of player options. </li>
<li>Challenge PCs at all levels of play. </li>
<li>Low DM prep time. </li>
<li>Easy presentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two 21 chapter Dimgaards currently in play. <i>Encounters with Gold</i> explores the dragonkin culture in Dimgaard. And the <i>Patron Wars</i> brings the Blood War to Dimgaard.</p>
<p>As an useful supplement in the examination of the Blood War, the next installment in the scaling of monsters from CR0-20 takes a look at barlguras - the apelike demons - with <i>GLD28 Barlguras CR0-20</i>. The other supplement reward is another expansion of the NPC galleries that are useful in many campaigns beyond Dimgaard with <i>DGN4 NPCs Vol. IV</i>.</p>
<p>Here are the summary statements for the seven modules offered:</p>
<h3><strong><i>Encounters with Gold</i></strong></h3>
<p><strong><i>EG14 Draconic Sanctums. </i></strong>For weeks the Dragon Cabal has terrorized southern Dimgaard with the assassinations of influential citizens. However, everyone who observed the campaign realized that this was a prelude – but to what? The answer threatens the lives and freedom of all who aren’t a part of the Dragon Cabal – even other dragonkin. Can heroes slow the Cabal’s onslaught? A Dungeons and Dragons® 5th Edition Adventure for 1-8 14th level characters. Episode 14 in <i>Encounters with Gold</i>.</p>
<p><strong><i>EG15 Draconic Escape. </i></strong>War has gripped southern Dimgaard as the Dragon Cabal makes its move. The defenders were destabilized and are fighting to regroup. Can heroes rescue the important assets from the beleaguered city of Odill before it falls? A Dungeons and Dragons® 5th Edition Adventure for 1-8 15th level characters. The 15th episode of <i>Encounters with Gold</i>.</p>
<p><strong><i>EG16 A Draconic Ally.</i></strong>  All southern Dimgaard is on the verge of falling under the dominion of the Dragon Cabal. The events have evolved so quickly that – although rumors are that the Metropolitan is attempting to coordinate a broad reactionary force – the Dragon Cabal has faced very little resistance. But a few forces are holding out – such as the Verdadis barony. Can heroes unify the disparate opposition to the Dragon Cabal into a force to turn the tide of the onslaught? A Dungeons and Dragons® 5th Edition Adventure for 1-8 16th level characters – the 16th episode in <i>Encounters with Gold</i>.</p>
<p><strong><i>EG17 The Draconic See.</i></strong> The Dragon Cabal has overwhelmed the communities of southern Dimgaard. They have begun to solidify their positions by ruthlessly eliminating resistance and coopting resources. Can heroes’ help keep the only center of organized resistance independent?

</div></div>","Welcome to the 27th volume of Dimgaard's DnD adventures. Thanks for the consideration. These are PDFs delivered through our proprietary document management system. If you want to see what a Dimgaard adventure module looks like, samples of the opening chapters in the two current campaigns (Patron Wars and Encounters with Gold) are available at www.dimgaard.com – as well as other information about the Dimgaard setting - including other free modules from past campaigns.
We would note the six principles that Dimgaard builds its adventures around (each of which is elaborated on at www.dimgaard.com):  

A strong story.   
Strict adherence to Rules As Written (RAW). 
Largest set of player options. 
Challenge PCs at all levels of play. 
Low DM prep time. 
Easy presentation.

There are two 21 chapter Dimgaards currently in play. Encounters with Gold explores the dragonkin culture in Dimgaard. And the Patron Wars brings the Blood War to Dimgaard.
As an useful supplement in the examination of the Blood War, the next installment in the scaling of monsters from CR0-20 takes a look at barlguras - the apelike demons - with GLD28 Barlguras CR0-20. The other supplement reward is another expansion of the NPC galleries that are useful in many campaigns beyond Dimgaard with DGN4 NPCs Vol. IV.
Here are the summary statements for the seven modules offered:
Encounters with Gold
EG14 Draconic Sanctums. For weeks the Dragon Cabal has terrorized southern Dimgaard with the assassinations of influential citizens. However, everyone who observed the campaign realized that this was a prelude – but to what? The answer threatens the lives and freedom of all who aren’t a part of the Dragon Cabal – even other dragonkin. Can heroes slow the Cabal’s onslaught? A Dungeons and Dragons® 5th Edition Adventure for 1-8 14th level characters. Episode 14 in Encounters with Gold.
EG15 Draconic Escape. War has gripped southern Dimgaard as the Dragon Cabal makes its move. The defenders were destabilized and are fighting to regroup. Can heroes rescue the important assets from the beleaguered city of Odill before it falls? A Dungeons and Dragons® 5th Edition Adventure for 1-8 15th level characters. The 15th episode of Encounters with Gold.
EG16 A Draconic Ally.  All southern Dimgaard is on the verge of falling under the dominion of the Dragon Cabal. The events have evolved so quickly that – although rumors are that the Metropolitan is attempting to coordinate a broad reactionary force – the Dragon Cabal has faced very little resistance. But a few forces are holding out – such as the Verdadis barony. Can heroes unify the disparate opposition to the Dragon Cabal into a force to turn the tide of the onslaught? A Dungeons and Dragons® 5th Edition Adventure for 1-8 16th level characters – the 16th episode in Encounters with Gold.
EG17 The Draconic See. The Dragon Cabal has overwhelmed the communities of southern Dimgaard. They have begun to solidify their positions by ruthlessly eliminating resistance and coopting resources. Can heroes’ help keep the only center of organized resistance independent? A Dungeons and Dragons® 5th Edition Adventure for 1-8 17th level characters. Episode seventeen in Encounters with Gold.
Patron Wars
PW5 The Corrupting Patron. With the River Styx cutting through Dimgaard, the Blood War floods into the region. While Farjvad is under attack, but relatively safe, the lesser communities are not faring well. Palga is a small community built around the caretaking of a sacred burial site. It has become the focus of Ansitif the Befouler. Can heroes protect the sanctity of Palga’s sites and relics? A Dungeons and Dragons® 5th Edition Adventure for 1-8 5th level characters. Episode 5 in the Patron Wars.
PW6 The Criminal Patron. Ulskov has long had a sketchy reputation – a haven for those wanted by justice, and rumored to be the source of many criminal plots. Word arrives that a new order is in place. Can heroes ensure that the newly forming syndicate will have not be an instrument of chaos, havoc, and murder? A Dungeons and Dragons® 5th Edition Adventure for 1-8 6th level characters. Episode 6 in the Patron Wars.
PW7 The Quiet Patron. Positioned closest to the breach the River Styx has created to the Abyss, Farberg should have been the first community to come under attack, but the agrarian community – an independent fief – has been quiet, and replied to inquiries that it is secure. But questions have arisen. Can heroes discern investigate this curious situation and bring revelations to light? A Dungeons and Dragons® 5th Edition Adventure for 1-8 7th level characters.

We developed a healthy board game rivalry (Henry always wins) after moving in together, playing a huge range of board games but particularly enjoying the more competitive ones where our unscrupulous natures are allowed to come to the fore. When not gaming we're always sharing games ideas together, which is how Manipulate was born. </p><p>The idea stemmed from Josh reading The Establishment by Owen Jones, and thinking about how the Media, Big Business and the Government are all in cahoots with each other and struggling for Power and influence. Originally just made as a bit of fun for us to play between us and our mates, we enjoyed it so much and the feedback was so good that we started to take it seriously and develop it into a marketable game.

The game has changed and improved so much through countless play tests and blind tests, such as at the UK Games Expo in Birmingham where we got awesome feedback. </p><p>We've hired Laura Payne to design it, who we think has done a fantastic job and finally have a prototype that we are really proud of and are incredibly excited to launch on Indiegogo! An absolute ton of hard work and effort has gone in to the game, as well as a lot of first hand experiences from living and working in London, and a lot of our sense of humour. We hope you love it as much as we do and really, really appreciate any support. Please feel free to share with your friends, family and on social media (and follow us on @manipulategame on any social media)!</p><p>Finally, we'd like to say a huge thank you to everyone who has helped in the development of the game - the friends and family who have playtested with us and helped us work through ideas. The guys at the UK games expo who tried out the game and gave us really helpful feedback.

We've listed these below with how we have mitigated them, but if you have any further questions then please get in touch with either of us at josh@walrusventures.com or henry@walrusventures.com.</p><p>1) Risk - that our manufacturer will not be able to produce the game in the time required and to the standard expected.</p><p>Mitigation - to mitigate this we've done extensive research on the best supplier for us. We got in touch with people who have previously created games and asked their advice and recommendations, we requested samples from a host of suppliers, and we've done online research into all the companies we spoke to. In the end we met and partnered with Long Pack Games because we have had the best experience with them, they have a great reputation and are very confident that they can get the job done to the standards we expect. We'll be in touch if there are any delays to the project, but we're hoping there won't be any! Our estimated fulfilment date in December 2018 includes leeway, but delays outside our control may still occur. Our project updates will keep all backers notified.</p><p>2) Risk - that our distributor will not be able to distribute the game to the dates required / fully intact.</p><p>Mitigation - see Risk 1's mitigation. Again, we've taken the necessary time and effort to research distributors and make sure we're getting the right people for the job. We're going with Games Quest for their excellent reputation and a recommendation from one of our friends after his successful campaign</p><p>3) Risk - potential impact of Brexit on currency increasing our costs.</p><p>Mitigation - While any major swings in currency will impact our manufacturing costs, we are mitigating this by buying USD towards the end of our pitch, which we will then use to pay Long Pack Games. This should minimise our risk and mean that no matter what the politicians do, your copy of Manipulate is safe.</p></div>","Facebook | Instagram | Twitter | WebsiteLink to reviewPlease see the link for the full Manipulate Rule Book (please note these are the rules in their current form, there may be some tweaks to the final version).  Below is a very quick summary of how to play the game.While setting up the game, players pick or randomly draw a Character (Celebrity, Criminal Mastermind, Head of Police, Media Mogul, Politician and Tech Entrepreneur) and associated Super Favour. Your Super Favour is a one time special ability that you can use to attack other players during the game. Players then take turns to build up their empire by setting up Ventures, attacking other players and making deals. At the end of the game, players count up Power from all Ventures, any Power bonuses and from their mountain of cash and declare a winner.The recommended game length is 8 rounds, but you can easily play for more or less. The reversible turn guide Rake in a ""chicken feed"" salary of £100k in your first turn which you can increase in following turns by setting up some Ventures. Build your empire - Set up Ventures to give you a steady stream of income and to build up your Power.Some Ventures have a white header bar with symbols, such as Jetsetter, and any Character can collect a set of these cards for extra Power at the end of the game.

Our estimated fulfilment date in December 2018 includes leeway, but delays outside our control may still occur. Our project updates will keep all backers notified.2) Risk - that our distributor will not be able to distribute the game to the dates required / fully intact.Mitigation - see Risk 1's mitigation. Again, we've taken the necessary time and effort to research distributors and make sure we're getting the right people for the job. We're going with Games Quest for their excellent reputation and a recommendation from one of our friends after his successful campaign3) Risk - potential impact of Brexit on currency increasing our costs.Mitigation - While any major swings in currency will impact our manufacturing costs, we are mitigating this by buying USD towards the end of our pitch, which we will then use to pay Long Pack Games. This should minimise our risk and mean that no matter what the politicians do, your copy of Manipulate is safe.",29.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Devil's Staircase Wild West is a fast, fun wild west roleplaying game played using poker cards. Rather than rolling a die and random chance  of high or low results, in this game you have a hand of cards and play the one that hits the goal. You will know when you are down to just a pair of 2s. Realistic it isn't, fun it most certainly is.</p>
<p>Character creation is as fast as being dealt a hand of cards and deciding what brought you out west.</p>
<p>Devil's Staircase is the diceless roleplaying game engine best suited to genres where gambling and poker were prevalent, the Wild West is the first game to use the engine.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The game is complete. It featured as a playtest on DriveThruRPG.com for a year and was downloaded 385 times and a companion supplement was downloaded 275 times. Since the end of the playtest the Quickstart pdf booklet has been downloaded a further 15 times in the past couple of weeks.</p>
<p>The development is all paid for and the game is ready to go. This campaign is all about reimbursing the costs involved in having the setting chapters professionally written by Neal Lithland and about funding more expansions and adventures. There is a lot of interest in Weird West and that would make a great follow up supplement.</p>
<p>Everyone who pledges, even $1, will get the full game text as a PDF and their name in the book as a backer. The pledges get bigger so do the rewards.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The funding target for this campaign is just £500 which is minimum allowed by IndieGoGo. Even if the game does not reach that target every pledge level will be met. £500 meets the expenses already paid out and allows for future marketing</p>
<p>In the future I would like to write a 1920s prohibition era game using the same game engine and a First World War Aces High rpg. Both of these I think will suit the poker style play. A successful campaign here would be a great motivator to write those other games.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is an exceptionally low risk project. Everything bar the print on demand proof copies has already been bought and paid for by me.</p>

<p>Fulfillment will be by OneBookShelp and DriveThruRPG.com. PDF documents will be send directly to backers within 2 weeks of the end the the campaign, to allow time to add the names to the PDF and for IndieGoGo to do their part. Printed books will be fulfilled by sending out at cost coupons, you only have to pay post and packaging.</p>

Utilizing our proprietary InSync system, the F18 is an integrative wireless mouse and mousepad solution that is always communicating with each other to provide a seamless user experience. With continuous wireless charging and synchronization through the mousepad, you will never have to worry about lag, transmission dropouts, or battery loss. By reducing the transmission distance to nearly zero, you can experience an unparalleled gaming experience that is lightning fast, precise, fully responsive, and comfortable. The future of PC gaming is here.   The newest Ford PowerFlow wireless charging technology ensures the endless charging while playing. FirstBlood invented its own proprietary fast wireless charging technology to deliver the ultimate high-performance wireless gaming experience. Unlike most of the existing wireless charging technologies, the F18 doesn’t require the mouse to sit steadily while charging. With the independently developed wireless charging chipset, the mousepad itself becomes a controllable electromagnetic field to achieve wireless transmission to the mouse. Thus, the mouse can be charged even when it is in play. No cables, no more battery replacements, no more fuss.

The ups, downs, elation and despair are what have always drawn me to the game. I revel in the dark underbelly of the setting - the blood, guts and treachery that counterpoint the simple task of carrying the ball to the end zone.</p><p>The Indiegogo campaign I present to you today captures, distils and refines these emotions into physical form. The campaign aims to raise enough funds to produce some incredibly high-quality coins and tokens for use with your favourite fantasy football game.</p><p>Let's take a walk on the dark side as we peruse in more detail the deadly delights of the art of corruption…</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521115250/diyh1epgzdrrkumwz7e9.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The coins and tokens for this for this project will be produced in a zinc alloy, which is then die stamped into the shape required and finished with hard coloured enamel. Ready to play with from the box and, within reason, indestructible, you'll be able to enjoy these items for many, many years to come.</p><p>As every game gives you the opportunity to foul, carry the ball, argue with the ref and of course flip for kick-off think of these less as accessories than as vital game aids alongside the scatter template or range ruler. Bribes too are a huge part of the game whether from inducements or just getting lucky at the kick-off!</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523804456/eon9qw6lj0htafzvpodm.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The ball. For some of us it’s the be-all and end-all of the game. For others it simply gets in the way of a good punch-up. Nevertheless, it’s important that we know where the ball is at any given point in the match. This token has been designed to fit easily around your player's base, be that <strong>25mm or 32mm</strong> in size. Moreover, with its cunningly designed shape, it fits snugly into the most crowded of cages or scraps. If the ball is loose on the pitch, simply flip the token to indicate it's up for grabs. Never again will you forget who’s holding the ball (and scrag them). </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523625163/mbjdbj3phc4gjiixbexx.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Being the coach of a fantasy football team is a difficult and frequently violently curtailed career choice. Some are better than others at dealing with the stresses of coaching a team, prowling the side-lines barking orders and questioning the calls and parentage of the referee.

Should they go too far and have to be removed from the game just for politely suggesting at knifepoint that the ref lets their poor little chainsaw back on the pitch then simply turn this coin over to show your coach has left the dugout.

In the excitement of the match we sometimes forget if and who has performed a foul action. Not anymore! This handy token slips over your player's base to show they have completed the foul action. Should the player in question be ejected from the field after attracting the attention of the referee then simply turn this token over to identify this player as caught and remove to the dugout.<br/><br/><u><strong>WARNING!</strong></u> Use of this token in the last turns of the game may lose you friends.

Such a wonderful thing. If you have deep enough pockets you can really gain an advantage with these. Foul to your heart's content, safe in the knowledge that you can just pay off the referee should they have the temerity to try to enforce the rules. Careful though, referees can be greedy bastards and you may need more than one to convince them to look the other way. Spend these valuable coins wisely.

My first dice project was to produce my very own Block Dice; I wanted to pour my creativity into something other than my day-to-day job. I produced around 100 sets of Block Dice and have successfully shared these with Blood Bowl leagues and fellow fanatics around the world. This led me to launch an Indiegogo Campaign for my Casualty Dice which successfully funded in under 24hrs and went on to raise 946% of the original goal.

You're well on your way to awesome levels of corruption! Don't worry, your desire to save money on shipping is celebrated here! The first step is to order your first Perk which will include your shipping fee and create an order number in the Indiegogo backend. <strong>To be eligible</strong> for no extra shipping charges on multiple perks or Add-Ons, your first perk ordered must be the <strong>'The Bribe Coins Pack' or any Perk above that tier</strong>. These perks are Tracked &amp; Signed Delivery and most importantly have insurance to cover loss or damage of all items.  This can be done by clicking the 'Get This Perk' button that sits on the Perks box. The next step is to order the extra Perks and/or Add-ons you’d like. To do this you need to use the ‘<strong>BACK IT</strong>’ button that sits above the Perks and below the Campaign Progress Bar on the right-hand side of the campaign web page, shown here:</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518444039/e9n3jgl2f0h5z6xkggdt.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>When you click ‘Back It’ it will ask for a ‘<strong>Donation Amount</strong>’. Here you need to add a figure that covers your requirement. So, for example, if you’ve ordered the ‘Absolute Corruption Pack’ but also require two extra sets of Bribe Coins for a couple of friends, you would enter £18 x the number of Bribe Coins Sets you require, in this case, two. That would make an extra donation amount of £36 and cover the extra Perks required. Of perhaps you'd like some freaking awesome Casualty Dice, just add an extra donation of £14 etc. </p><p>Once you’ve made that Donation, take a look at your original<strong> ABSOLUTE CORRUPTION PACK (or whatever it is you ordered) </strong>order details in your Indiegogo page. Take note of your ‘<strong>Order ID</strong>’ (a two or three-digit number). Once you have that number you can then use the Contact Button to send me a message. Here you will be able tell me your original<strong> Order ID </strong>and what you would like to order as extra items and/or Add-ons. It’s <strong>VERY</strong> important that those details are given to me, so I can compile your order and ship to you on time at no extra cost. Any extra items that are ordered this way will also include any stretch goals that are available to them.</p><p>If you have any problems during the process of adding to your original order, please do not hesitate to contact me via this website, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/CharlieVictorProducts/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a>, <a href=""https://twitter.com/CV_Products"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twitter</a> or email me at <a href=""mailto:charlievictorproducts@gmail.com?subject=Multiple%20Items%20Order"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">charlievictorproducts@gmail.com</a> - I’m here to help.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521115277/r9rsqc6jj3dclztvxdpv.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>This project does not aim to break any technological bounds nor does it pretend to be anything other than an opportunity for me to bring my design ideas to life, and for you in the community to have fun with them.

The ups, downs, elation and despair are what have always drawn me to the game. I revel in the dark underbelly of the setting - the blood, guts and treachery that counterpoint the simple task of carrying the ball to the end zone.The Indiegogo campaign I present to you today captures, distils and refines these emotions into physical form. The campaign aims to raise enough funds to produce some incredibly high-quality coins and tokens for use with your favourite fantasy football game.Let's take a walk on the dark side as we peruse in more detail the deadly delights of the art of corruption…The coins and tokens for this for this project will be produced in a zinc alloy, which is then die stamped into the shape required and finished with hard coloured enamel. Ready to play with from the box and, within reason, indestructible, you'll be able to enjoy these items for many, many years to come.As every game gives you the opportunity to foul, carry the ball, argue with the ref and of course flip for kick-off think of these less as accessories than as vital game aids alongside the scatter template or range ruler. Bribes too are a huge part of the game whether from inducements or just getting lucky at the kick-off!The ball. For some of us it’s the be-all and end-all of the game. For others it simply gets in the way of a good punch-up. Nevertheless, it’s important that we know where the ball is at any given point in the match. This token has been designed to fit easily around your player's base, be that 25mm or 32mm in size. Moreover, with its cunningly designed shape, it fits snugly into the most crowded of cages or scraps. If the ball is loose on the pitch, simply flip the token to indicate it's up for grabs. Never again will you forget who’s holding the ball (and scrag them). Being the coach of a fantasy football team is a difficult and frequently violently curtailed career choice. Some are better than others at dealing with the stresses of coaching a team, prowling the side-lines barking orders and questioning the calls and parentage of the referee. Sometimes they go a little too far…Assuming all's well, this coach coin shows your head coach where they belong, in the dugout. Should they go too far and have to be removed from the game just for politely suggesting at knifepoint that the ref lets their poor little chainsaw back on the pitch then simply turn this coin over to show your coach has left the dugout. With any luck, they'll recover from their 'security escort' in time for the next match…Fouling is a fantastic part of the fantasy football world. There is no greater feeling than having a no-name lineman suddenly become the hero after booting a fallen star player to death! In the excitement of the match we sometimes forget if and who has performed a foul action. Not anymore! This handy token slips over your player's base to show they have completed the foul action. Should the player in question be ejected from the field after attracting the attention of the referee then simply turn this token over to identify this player as caught and remove to the dugout.WARNING! Use of this token in the last turns of the game may lose you friends. Charlie Victor Products does not accept liability for loss of limbs, life or rides home in such circumstances.Bribery! Such a wonderful thing. If you have deep enough pockets you can really gain an advantage with these. Foul to your heart's content, safe in the knowledge that you can just pay off the referee should they have the temerity to try to enforce the rules. Careful though, referees can be greedy bastards and you may need more than one to convince them to look the other way. Spend these valuable coins wisely. You can track your spending by turning each one over after use. The bloody tears on the reverse side of each coin will be a dead giveaway as to its status. Try not to roll too many ones…Nobody and I mean NOBODY bribes as hard as Goblins do. They are masters at it, which is just as well as they're terrible at everything else. They work hard to subvert the rules, so much so that the little buggers stole the original bribe coin stamps and produced their own versions, with some very dubious amendments! They have even tried to dodge showing if they have used them at all - very sneaky stuff the gits! Never fear though, because the bloody tears reverse side always gives away the status of the bribe. Charlie Victor is very proud to present this special kick-off coin. Every game of fantasy football starts with a kick-off. The referee flips the coin after a coach has picked a side. Heads or Tentacles? There are old stories of coaches rolling dice to see who kicks and receives. Well, no more!We at Charlie Victor are very proud of this coin, confident that it is at least the equal of any fantasy football community produced coin in existence. A quality item for a momentous choice - kick or receive?This Limited Edition of the Kick-Off Coin will be produced in a Black Dye Metal finish with Coloured Soft Enamel, ONLY 100 units will ever be produced making this the most collectable coin in the campaign.One of my duties as Commissioner of the Leicester Blood Bowl League is to attract and retain Blood Bowl Coaches from all over the shire of Leicester and beyond. To achieve this, each coach that takes part in and completes a league season with us is presented with a 'loot' item. Previously we’ve had unique dog tags, poker chips, dice bags and, in Season III, the set of high quality bribe coins that you see below. These went down very well and the spare sets that I did have (due to a minimum order amount of 100) sold very quickly to overseas collectors.Inspired by the success of these coins I’ve always wanted to reproduce them for the community at large. This naturally led me to produce a new campaign celebrating the glorious corruption of fantasy football and all the awesome shenanigans that go with it.As with my previous project for the Casualty Dice, this project will also include Stretch Goal Inducement Cards. These have proven to be very popular indeed, and as a result I’m excited to announce that there will be more cards in this project, created at the same size as before and by the same artist Rob Parham, so, for anyone who already has a set from the original project, these new cards will fit seamlessly into your deck. If you don't have a set of cards from the Casualty Dice project then never fear, you can now buy a set of Casualty Dice and Cards as an Add On to your pledge to this campaign.These cards will be two very different wizards for use in your matches. Never again will you ever forget to zap that ball carrier or firebomb a cage in the second half.Next up is a High Quality Embroidered Patch for the 'FAS' - the Foul Appreciation Society! This patch will be produced to a high standard and come with an iron on material on the reverse. I plan to slap mine onto my favourite shirt and show the world just how foul I am.Introducing, Fouling Dice. As anyone who backed the Casualty Dice project will know, I’m a bit of a dice fanatic! I LOVE dice. I could not do a campaign that does not include them, so here we have the ‘Armour & Blood Dice’ A special set of D6 with all sides engraved with some pretty brutal foul manoeuvres. Each side will also detail the number equivalent to the foul performed, so that calculations can be made after rolling. Be careful though, should you happen to perform two of the same manoeuvre on the downed player the referee is bound to notice and may eject you from the game. Don’t worry though, your coach I’m sure will argue your case and everything will be just fine!This assistant can be used to help your coach and their dodgy dealings during the match. Careful though, if you push too hard, your coach and assistant can both face the consequences!It's important to note which Perks include which Stretch Goals. Please take careful note of the graph above to clarify which Stretch Goals you will receive with your Perk. Any addition items you order (instructions below) will also come with the relevant Stretch Goal items included.Back by popular demand are my Casualty Dice from my first Indiegogo Campaign. You can now order yourself a set(s) of Casualty Dice as an Add-On to any of the Perks you have back on this project. Once you have backed a Perk, please then follow the instructions further down this page to see how to order Add-On's or extra items from the campaign. Remember, cards from both campaigns will seamlessly fit together as they are designed to the same specification.Add the regular Kick-Off Coin to your Limited Edition Corruption Pack purchase, completing the set! NOTE: This Add On is ONLY available to backers who have backed the 'Limited Edition Corruption Pack' Once you have backed the Limited Edition Corruption Pack, please then follow the instructions further down this page to see how to order this Add-On.My name is Duncan; I’m a 38-year-old self-employed designer with 20+ years of industry experience, living in Leicester, UK. I’m also the founder and current Commissioner of the Leicester Blood Bowl League (LBBL).As a designer and design fanatic I have a good feel for what good design should look like and how it should perform. My first dice project was to produce my very own Block Dice; I wanted to pour my creativity into something other than my day-to-day job. I produced around 100 sets of Block Dice and have successfully shared these with Blood Bowl leagues and fellow fanatics around the world. This led me to launch an Indiegogo Campaign for my Casualty Dice which successfully funded in under 24hrs and went on to raise 946% of the original goal. The link for the project can be found here:Charlie Victors Casualty DiceI just love to produce design, no matter how small or large the idea. I get a real kick out of seeing people using products I have created, and this is where I hope you, the community can come in and help my vision for these Coins of Corruption to become a reality. Here is a selection of my previous creative work, some of which you may recognise. Congratulations! You're well on your way to awesome levels of corruption! Don't worry, your desire to save money on shipping is celebrated here! The first step is to order your first Perk which will include your shipping fee and create an order number in the Indiegogo backend. To be eligible for no extra shipping charges on multiple perks or Add-Ons, your first perk ordered must be the 'The Bribe Coins Pack' or any Perk above that tier. These perks are Tracked & Signed Delivery and most importantly have insurance to cover loss or damage of all items.  This can be done by clicking the 'Get This Perk' button that sits on the Perks box. The next step is to order the extra Perks and/or Add-ons you’d like. To do this you need to use the ‘BACK IT’ button that sits above the Perks and below the Campaign Progress Bar on the right-hand side of the campaign web page, shown here:When you click ‘Back It’ it will ask for a ‘Donation Amount’. Here you need to add a figure that covers your requirement. So, for example, if you’ve ordered the ‘Absolute Corruption Pack’ but also require two extra sets of Bribe Coins for a couple of friends, you would enter £18 x the number of Bribe Coins Sets you require, in this case, two. That would make an extra donation amount of £36 and cover the extra Perks required. Of perhaps you'd like some freaking awesome Casualty Dice, just add an extra donation of £14 etc. Once you’ve made that Donation, take a look at your original ABSOLUTE CORRUPTION PACK (or whatever it is you ordered) order details in your Indiegogo page. Take note of your ‘Order ID’ (a two or three-digit number). Once you have that number you can then use the Contact Button to send me a message. Here you will be able tell me your original Order ID and what you would like to order as extra items and/or Add-ons. It’s VERY important that those details are given to me, so I can compile your order and ship to you on time at no extra cost. Any extra items that are ordered this way will also include any stretch goals that are available to them.If you have any problems during the process of adding to your original order, please do not hesitate to contact me via this website, Facebook, Twitter or email me at charlievictorproducts@gmail.com - I’m here to help.This project does not aim to break any technological bounds nor does it pretend to be anything other than an opportunity for me to bring my design ideas to life, and for you in the community to have fun with them. It’s in my nature to share and I very much want to share this with you.I’m deliberately using die stamping and hard enamel because, despite it being more expensive, it’s by far the best quality finish and has an increased longevity over any other type of production process.Backers can choose from eleven different Perks. Ranging from just £16 all the way up to £54. As with my previous project I always want to keep the barrier to entry as low as possible, while offering the high end of the Perk levels to those who wish to have a complete collection.All coin designs featured here in 2D & 3D are for visual purposes only and could be subject to small changes. Some small details can be lost in the process of stamping, so, for an accurate feel for detail and finish on these coins, please reference the LBBL Bribe Coins pictured above.I like to think I’m a trusted member of the Fantasy Football Community and I value that trust immensely. I responsibly manage the finances of the LBBL and have previously produced and delivered to hundreds of backers around the world my Casualty Dice Project. I have produced a similar product in the past so I’m very confident in completing this project to the standard I’ve seen before. I think the point I’m trying to make is you can trust in me to deliver this project to you, my reputation depends on it.There is not really much in terms of challenges that haven’t already been overcome. I have the designs completed and prototyped and I’m using a trusted producer that can produce the quantities we might need. I’ve been designing products for many years so understand the challenges of shipping products across the world. I’m 100% confident that I’m equipped to deliver this project. I aim to ship this project to Backers around October 2018.Please consider backing this project and spread the word to as many people as you can. After the Casualty Dice project closed I had many people message me wanting to have a set of dice. It’s great to have these people come forward, even better if this back the project in the first instance. If however you choose not to back this project then please feel free to share this project with people you think would like to get involved. This support would be very much appreciated and could make all the difference.Thank you for taking the time to read my pitch, and I hope you choose to help me succeed on this passion project of mine. Should you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask; I'll be ready and waiting to answer them.Cheers!Duncan",29.0,0,"5 Campaigns

</div></div>","Why did we make the Vortex?We’re a team of three designers and too often we realised we weren’t giving ourselves any time out from work. We’re the generation that’s overworked to the brink with deadlines, meetings and targets to hit and so, we just wanted something that would let us put it all on pause for just a minute.Think back to the time when you’re at the checkout and fumbling to put all the coins and cash away, if you had a minute where everything just paused, the relief that comes with it is like nothing else. Now apply that to your work, life and everything else you have going on.Oftentimes, that moment to breathe is all you need to help you refocus and get your attention back. A moment of tranquility in the palm of your hand.This is what we set out to achieve.
 The Vortex fits any size of fingers, from small children (while supervised) to the biggest of adults. We all need to take a moment to just detract ourselves from the stressors of daily life. 
 Throw your Vortex into an exhilarating nose dive and let it tear up a paradoxical upside down spin on your desk space.Turn your world in the opposite direction and let the Vortex animate your desktop.  The scores along the neck are designed purposefully to give you the maximum grip while providing a dazzling show.Even with the stickiest of fingers, the Vortex provides enough tension to spin it your way.  Nestle it in your front pocket or day bag to ensure you always have it to hand whenever and wherever you need it.You'll never forget the restful relaxation you get each and every day with your Vortex.  Have a good ol’ fashioned spin off and pit yourself against a worthy adversary to see who can spin the longest.With over a minute of spin time, you can have plenty of tiny games to let off some steam throughout the day.
 Checking our smart tech on breaks immediately raises levels of anxiety without us even knowing.Watching the soothing spiral of the Vortex helps settle your blood pressure, heart rate and breathing into a harmonious pattern, all at once, achieving a refreshingly peaceful timeout.  In the haze of stress, our cognitive functions and memory become confused which leads to unwanted mistakes and missed timescales.Vortex is there to help you step back from the noise. By taking a spin, we allow ourselves a little time to re-centre and our brain.  How many times have you put your phone down, only to pick it right back up again right after, for no good reason? It’s all too easy to feel restless at work.Let Vortex take you to a world where you can refocus your brain and reanimate your desk with the twist of a finger.  Immerse yourself in present mindfulness and lift your mood. Engage every part of your senses to notice each touch and sound so that you savour every sensation.Let Vortex lift your mood and be present in the moment. Raise your spirits organically with each spin, with a feeling of all-round wellbeing.   Brass is commonly used for the decorative and low friction properties it has. It’s the perfect centrepiece for a sophisticated mahogany workspace. The more you use it, the more the gold sheen will patina over time to create a more personal piece.It’s weighty feel and increased spin time makes this a firm favourite amongst spinning top aficionados. 316 Stainless Steel is the strongest and most robust version we could mill into the silhouette of a Vortex. Made up of Nickel, Chromium, Manganese and a few other elements, it is ultra-durable and provides excellent resistance to corrosion. It is used in hospitals and the automotive industries, so it's made to last.Lose yourself in the endless shimmer of the sharp, clean and contemporary finish of the Stainless Steel. 
 Vortex fits perfectly between your finger tips. Its ergonomic and reassuringly familiar feel sends us back to our roots of classical and comforting entertainment.  Having a beautifully crafted classical desk spinner at your finger tips, yet light and small enough to fit into the small jean pocket, ensures you are ready wherever and whenever to immerse yourself in the Vortex.  Vortex enhances the feeling of space and time on our desk space and looks right at home. An outlet at hands reach to remind us to take regular breaks, but without the distracting effects of modern technology.  Our day bag is often filled with clutter that only adds to the daily stresses. By placing Vortex into your daily arsenal of tools, it adds an escape to ‘me time’, unlike anything else you carry.

<p> Initially, we laser-cut a keyboard-shaped box from thick cardboard to store our cards, just for fun. To our surprise, people went crazy over the box! There were actually some people who bought our early test version of the game just for the box, without even trying the game! We knew we had something special on our hands.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/SYLv04q.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We could have went with the conventional cardboard box but <strong><i>we wanted all of you to feel the same sense of amazement</i></strong> we felt when the cards were stored in such an amazing box. We've searched high and low for a manufacturer in China who would be willing to work on a project like this for an affordable rate with high standards for manufacturing quality. We're glad to give you a quick preview of the final design and we'll update you as manufacturing progresses!</p>

<p>Due to cost issues with manufacturing small quantities, we are only able to print the game in English.

<li>The Note cards will come with an extra 8 cards of B and H. If you use the ""ABCDEFG"" system, you can simply throw away the extra B and H cards and vice versa. </li>
<li>All Note cards will also include the fixed-do solfege notation on them. An ""A"" Note will have a ""La"" on it and so forth.</li>
<li>All descriptions involving time value of Notes will have both the American and English versions in it. It will appear as ""Eighth Note / Quaver"" for example.</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Lord of the Chords LLP was founded in 2018, by Jonathan, Jun Yu and Keith. All three of us engineering majors at university. We are proud to say that the three of us have taken a year's leave of absence to ensure that fulfilment goes smoothly. There's nothing more that we want than for Lord of the Chords to be in your hands, wow-ing your friends, making you laugh, and showing you that music theory can in fact be fun!</p>
<p>At Lord of the Chords, we strive to make products that are beautiful, hilarious, and enlightening, and we think we've done that with this game.</p>
<p>The money raised by this campaign will be used to fund the first round of production for Lord of the Chords. This includes injection molding for the box, manufacturing costs for the cards, rulebook and tokens, and shipping.</p>
<p>We have done our best to accurately gauge our costs by building relationships with our future manufacturers and suppliers.</p>
<p>While printing, shipping, and processing delays are always a possibility, we have set a reasonable delivery date based on our experience.</p>
<p>Fun Guaranteed! <br/>We want you to love your experience with Lord of the Chords. If you don't enjoy the game after you've received and played it, just send it back to our headquarters and we'll issue you a full refund, no questions asked.</p>
<p>Refunds – Indiegogo<br/>If you'd like a refund before your item ships, you have until one week before the scheduled ship date to request one. We can offer you a 90% refund since the Indiegogo retains about 10% of your pledge for various fees. If there is something wrong with your item, we appreciate the opportunity to replace or exchange it. If a refund is preferred and there is no defect with the product, you'll be responsible for shipping it back to us. Upon receipt of the returned item, we'll issue you a 90% refund. Refund requests must be made within 30 days of the date the item was delivered to you.</p>
<p>Replacements <br/>We are always happy to replace defective or damaged tokens, cards, or other components. Just send us photos of the damage, and we will ship a replacement at no additional cost to you. If your item needs to be returned, we will cover the cost of the return shipping. We provide replacement pieces while titles are active in our catalog, which is typically at least a year after their initial printing. Replacement requests must be made within 30 days of the date the item was delivered to you.</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","Initially, we laser-cut a keyboard-shaped box from thick cardboard to store our cards, just for fun. To our surprise, people went crazy over the box! There were actually some people who bought our early test version of the game just for the box, without even trying the game! We knew we had something special on our hands.

We could have went with the conventional cardboard box but we wanted all of you to feel the same sense of amazement we felt when the cards were stored in such an amazing box. We've searched high and low for a manufacturer in China who would be willing to work on a project like this for an affordable rate with high standards for manufacturing quality. We're glad to give you a quick preview of the final design and we'll update you as manufacturing progresses!

Whether you need a memorable boss fight at the end of a dungeon, a random encounter more engaging than 2d6 goblins, or just a little inspiration to help you design your own masterwork challenge, The Total Party Kill Handbook will help your campaign level up.The encounters included in The Total Party Kill Handbook span the full range of character levels from 1 to 20, and each includes scaling guidelines and suggestions for altering the challenge for higher or lower level adventurers. More than just stat blocks and a grid, you get notes on monster tactics, reminders about which rules are likely to come up during play, and suggested reactions to common (or uncommon) actions the players may take. Each encounter includes a number of helpful tags covering appropriate terrain types for the encounter to take place in as well as which types of characters will do well in the challenge, and which types will struggle.What exciting adventures await your players? 
An unassuming pool of shallow water, hiding crafty water elementals determined to drag trespassers into an aquifer beneath the ground! 
A gang of doppelgangers lurking in a trap-filled maze, ready to divide and conquer! 
Innocent looking bridges that conceal nests of harpies, a long fall, and hungry carrion crawlers in the depths below! 
Iron golems, a crazed pyromancer, and too many deadly gnomish contraptions to count guarding a fantastic treasure hoard! 
Top it all off with a crazed hydra trapped inside a ruined keep, with each of its heads in a different, dangerous room!
Beyond the encounters, you also get The Trap Workshop. A new way to build traps for the 5th Edition game, The Trap Workshop contains a broad selection of types, triggers, and modifiers to help you build traps that are both exciting (for you) and terrifying (for your players). How does it work? You start by picking from the list of trap types, which range from simple pit traps or projectiles to complex moving floor systems and clouds of gas with multiple effects. Each of these types is scaled by party level, with damage and difficulty checks figured out for you. Then, you select a triggering mechanism, anything from the typical tripwire to the more unusual trap that goes off if anyone speaks louder than a whisper. Finally, you can add modifiers to your contraption, including encounter changing terrain effects, illusions to confound your players, as well as a collection of effects designed to split the party, for when you really want to push your players.On top of that, the book includes several example traps with a bit more flair than your typical swinging blades. You can look forward to reading about The Early Retirement, The Used-to-be-an-Adventurer-Like-You, and the mad wizard’s favorite, The Spellctacular Finisher. The challenges in this book aren’t designed to require lucky dice rolls or optimized characters; they are designed instead to challenge the players to think critically, work as a team, and react to the unexpected. They reward good planning, preparation, and generally doing something other than drawing their weapons and charging at the first thing they see. Finally, The Trap Compendium contains 50 unique traps, each more devious than the last, totaling close to 80 pages. We'll design these traps using the mechanisms from The Trap Workshop portion of The Total Party Kill Handbook, and include additional supplements to The Trap Workshop's creation process. Are your players ready?We're excited to bring you The Total Party Kill Handbook, but we've got some awesome ideas for follow-up projects that'll really knock this out of the park! The Trap Compendium -- UNLOCKED via Kickstarter!The TPK Adventure Module -- $25,000If we reach $25,000 in total funding (Kickstarter and IndieGoGo), we’ll unlock an official Total Party Kill Adventure Module as an Add-On for $15 (digital PDF) or $20 (physical softcover).

<h3>Barnorsk Orcs of the Wild North</h3>
<p><i>A reclusive Orc tribe who share little of their culture with others, the Barnorsk dwell in the deep north where the biting cold of the never-ending winter is a brand of torture all its own. The harsh inhospitable nature of the Barnorsk environment, and the fact that few traders ever enter their lands, has skewed their world view to the point where all non-Orc races are viewed as imperfect and they enter into alliances only after much consideration. As their lands are rumoured to contain great wealth, the occasional warband or adventurer's party will take a chance with the inclement weather but these are almost always unsuccessful. Initially, their Frontier Guard were unrelenting in their attacks on the unwelcome visitors in an attempt to be rid of them but now they allow the weather to do their job for them.</i></p>

Sonic the Hedgehog: Battle Racers comes with 5 iconic Sonic characters as Pre-Painted Miniatures, each with a different Racing style.

Each Racer has a Pre-Painted Miniature, Racer Profile, and Speed Token. Each Racer Profile contains the Racer’s unique special Ability, Power, and is used to track the Racer’s Speed, and Rings collected throughout the game.

If racing against four opponents isn’t enough of a challenge, try adding a Boss to your game. Included in the Super Pledge, characters such as Dr. Eggman can be used as a normal Racer or a Boss in the game with different abilities and effects.

Bosses are not controlled by any player and have a Boss Profile detailing their special rules and effects, combined with their own specific set of Boss Cards used during the game, each Boss presents a new challenge for Racers to overcome.

What Sonic game would be complete without Badniks getting in the way and causing trouble for the Racers? Buzz Bomber, Crabmeat, Spinner, and Moto Bug each present a different threat, and with them covering the track, you will have to consider the risks and plan your route carefully.
Sculpted Badniks are a LIMITED-TIME BONUS to this campaign (they are included in the Super Pledge and Hyper Pledge) and will not come in the retail version of the game.

Every track section presents a new set of challenges to be navigated. With a variety of different tracks being randomly placed throughout the game, so no two races will be alike!

Each round, every player will choose an Agility Card to play. Agility Cards are a combination of one Action and one Movement. The Action portion can adjust a Racer’s Speed, allow them to Jump over obstacles and Badniks, or even activate a Racer’s Power, to name just a few choices. The Movement portion allows you to Run or Jump, and is always mandatory — this is a racing game after all!

Shipping will be charged after the campaign through our pledge manager, based on the actual cost to ship your pledge and any additional rewards you select. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all.
We will ship your rewards from the closest of several fulfillment hubs around the world.
Our current estimate for shipping costs are listed below:
Africa: $80 to most countriesAsia: $10 - $15 to China and Hong Kong, $30 - $40 to most other countries, $50 - $60 to Russia and Israel, $70 to Turkey, We cannot estimate Malaysia.Canada: $15 - $30 to most cities.Europe: $20 - $30 to Germany. $20 - $30 to most other countries. $35 - $50 to Scandinavia, Estland, Lettland, Latvia, Bosnia/Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia. $50 - $60 to Bulgaria, Lithuania, Romania, and Iceland. $70 to Greece and Ukraine.Latin America: $60 - 70 to most countries.Oceania: $20 - $45 to Australia. $30 - $40 to New Zealand.UK: $10 - $15 to most cities.USA: $10 - $15 to most cities. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.

We cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.

<p>Dear backers!</p>
<p><strong><i>BLOOD OF THE NORTHMEN </i></strong>is the latest game by <strong><i>Carl Chudyk</i></strong> (Glory To Rome, Innovation, Impulse) taking players north of Europe into the wild Nordic lands of the 9th century. Each player controls his own Viking clan with a unique ability. Players playing tiles from hand together build a board on which they place their warriors. Each tile in the game is both a board element, an action card, and strength in a fight. During the game, players gain victory points by fighting other clans, as well as by taking strategic settlements. The game is filled with negative interaction and a huge amount of strategy and tactics. The game has an unusual and unique mechanics of using tiles, not yet seen in other games. <strong><i>120 unique tiles, 48 high detailed figures and 12 Strongholds</i></strong> are just some of the items in the box. Carl Chudyk is back with a really innovative game, BIG game, that we would like to fund and publish with your help. It won't work without you. As always, we count on your help and support.</p>

<h3>What is the Core Codex?</h3>
<p>The Codex contains a complete RPG 'engine' designed to allow players the freedom to build characters of their liking. For the GM it provides a toolkit from which any campaign setting can be built from the ground up. </p>

<p>It wasn't until well into my adulthood that I discovered my autism. Looking back with that knowledge I can see just how much RPGs helped me to socialise and develop. For me, this is what the Codex represents. That is to say, it is more than just a hobby project or something I just want to share with people, but a statement about how we as individuals grow and change.</p>

Mysterious Cases combine the drama and intrigue of a long lost tale, with the puzzle solving marvels of an Escape Room.Part game, part book, and part interactive adventure, each Mysterious Case contains codes to crack, puzzles to solve, letters to snoop, boxes within boxes to unlock...all leading to the dramatic conclusion of an intriguing mystery. STRETCH GOAL ANNOUNCED! If our campaign reaches $100,000, EVERY backer will get an EXCLUSIVE 3D pop-up vignette of a stand-alone, Mysterious Case moment - designed by Robert Sabuda!This pop-up will be EXCLUSIVE to the campaign. While we hope to continue offering our Mysterious Cases after the campaign ends (though we can't guarantee our current low prices), this pop-up will ONLY be available to you, our supportive and faithful Indiegogo backers! Exercise your detective skills from the comfort of your armchair!These boxes contain:
An intriguing tale of mystery to solve
Tactile, hands-on puzzles

 We’re raising funds to produce the first three Mysterious Cases:  Mysterious Case No. 117:The Kidnapped Crossworder
  An underground den of gangsters where everyone is keeping secrets. A vanished inventor…a million motives.Ms. Angela B. has invented a new game. Eager to show it off, she brings it to her local crossword puzzle enthusiasts’ club. However, the prototype is stolen soon afterwards, and she begins to suspect her fellow club members of foul play. She sets about gathering evidence…only to disappear herself.       The Kidnapped Crossworder is a code breaker’s dream, with puzzles galore and a winding plot full of secretive characters. Decode the mystery of the stolen prototype and the secret of its vanished inventor!  Mysterious Case No. 238:The Druids’ Catacomb
  A curious traveler discovers an ancient tunnel and a gauntlet of tests. But as his explorations deepen, the questions only multiply, and something is lying in wait… An ancient megalithic stone structure has collapsed in a forest in Europe, and Dr. Richard Wise has arrived to assess the damage. As he sets about documenting the site, he finds an entrance to a series of underground chambers, evidently untouched for thousands of years.     The chambers have been perfectly preserved, and as he explores, he discovers a peculiar wooden box, locked and covered in ancient Celtic carvings. What tests lie within? And are these tunnels as empty as they claim to be?     Can you solve the mystery of The Druid’s Catacomb? Like a Russian nesting doll, this Mysterious Case contains a box within a box, within a box, within a box, with each puzzle providing the solution to open the next. You’ve never experienced tactile tasks like these before!  Mysterious Case No. 354:The Star-Crossed Scientists  Two brilliant minds, two unforgiving societies. How can theybe together when everyone wants them apart? Travel back intime and around the world to reveal the mystery! She’s a brilliant researcher at one of the most prestigious universities in Victorian England......he’s a passionate and reckless expert funded by the greatest wildlife society of all time. It seems everyone, and everything, is working to keep them apart. Can they overcome the odds and find a place for themselves in a savage world? Follow the clues, unlock secrets, and reveal who is behind the devious plot!  As a special bonus, Star-Crossed Scientists contains something not seen since 19th century Victorian England: a mechanical drawing automaton!

<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p><br/>We would like to invite you to support our second crowdfunding campaign dedicated to <strong>high quality resin miniatures</strong>. All of them are <strong>compatible with Fantasy Battles: The 9th Age.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>During our first campaign we showed our possibilities and strong orientation for reaching customers needs and vision of miniatures. Also projects presented in this campaign were started some time ago and developed with The 9th Age community to be as good as it was possible. <strong>Our very talented sculptors, artists and manufacturers are doing all their best to provide you with the best products possible.</strong> We have hope, and strongly believe, that you will enjoy what you see below.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your support is very important for us. While we see that our products are still needed we will run future releases. So thank you in advance to give us that possibility.<br/> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480445876/cdjxjdmnkmazey1p3pms.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h2>What our process look like:</h2>
<p><strong>1. 3D sculpt</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480612487/pf7hsvk24tfmhhis9fsn.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>1b. 3D sculpt of alternative options (as stretched goal)</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>2. Printing than casting resin models</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>3. Professional painting (as special option)</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p>All 3D sculpts has already been made. We need your help to invest in production molds and materials. Also stretch goals will help us raise finds to make some alternative versions and options for our miniatures, which for sure you will also like as base versions. <br/><br/>We would like you to contribute during the development with your ideas. Please send emails (<a href=""http://hiddendreamsminiatures@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hiddendreamsminiatures@gmail.com</a>), make comments here or post on Facebook, telling us any suggestions you may have. Your ideas will be base of mentioned before alternative options. Some of them we noticed during the development process but there is still a chance to integrate yours. You will feel that your ideas are coming alive.<br/><br/>As mentioned in the process example, for those of you that don't particularly enjoy painting miniatures and view it more as a chore that needs to be done, <strong>Hidden Dreams will also paint your miniatures with a color scheme of your choice and send you the finished models.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480447081/knpjhtfnnaskug93exyo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the bottom of the site there is a list showing the current status of models sold required to make alternative options of the miniatures and that status will be updated over time. <strong>All presented miniatures will be cast.</strong> The question is only which ones will receive their alternatives.<br/><br/>One last thing: the delivery times are an approximation. Everything should be delivered in time, but some things could be delayed, while others could be faster. The delivery times are flexible at this point and will be changed based on the demand for specific miniatures. We will do our best to provide them at least in March 2017 and this is a very real date.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>So if you like the look of the miniatures below, please support us, so we can create them for you. If you know someone who might be interested, tell him/her about this crowdfunding campaign. Visit and like our Facebook page and please spread the word wherever you can.<br/><br/>And last but not least <strong>we would like to thank everyone who supports our company.</strong> We would also like to thank the crew of The 9th Age, and everyone who is involved in the development of that great project.

</div></div>","Welcome!
We would like to invite you to support our second crowdfunding campaign dedicated to high quality resin miniatures. All of them are compatible with Fantasy Battles: The 9th Age.
 
During our first campaign we showed our possibilities and strong orientation for reaching customers needs and vision of miniatures. Also projects presented in this campaign were started some time ago and developed with The 9th Age community to be as good as it was possible. Our very talented sculptors, artists and manufacturers are doing all their best to provide you with the best products possible. We have hope, and strongly believe, that you will enjoy what you see below.
 
Your support is very important for us. While we see that our products are still needed we will run future releases. So thank you in advance to give us that possibility. 

 
What our process look like:
1. 3D sculpt

 
1b. 3D sculpt of alternative options (as stretched goal)

 
2. Printing than casting resin models

 
3. Professional painting (as special option)

 

 
All 3D sculpts has already been made. We need your help to invest in production molds and materials. Also stretch goals will help us raise finds to make some alternative versions and options for our miniatures, which for sure you will also like as base versions. We would like you to contribute during the development with your ideas. Please send emails (hiddendreamsminiatures@gmail.com), make comments here or post on Facebook, telling us any suggestions you may have. Your ideas will be base of mentioned before alternative options. Some of them we noticed during the development process but there is still a chance to integrate yours. You will feel that your ideas are coming alive.As mentioned in the process example, for those of you that don't particularly enjoy painting miniatures and view it more as a chore that needs to be done, Hidden Dreams will also paint your miniatures with a color scheme of your choice and send you the finished models.
 

 
At the bottom of the site there is a list showing the current status of models sold required to make alternative options of the miniatures and that status will be updated over time. All presented miniatures will be cast. The question is only which ones will receive their alternatives.One last thing: the delivery times are an approximation. Everything should be delivered in time, but some things could be delayed, while others could be faster. The delivery times are flexible at this point and will be changed based on the demand for specific miniatures. We will do our best to provide them at least in March 2017 and this is a very real date.
 

 
So if you like the look of the miniatures below, please support us, so we can create them for you. If you know someone who might be interested, tell him/her about this crowdfunding campaign. Visit and like our Facebook page and please spread the word wherever you can.And last but not least we would like to thank everyone who supports our company. We would also like to thank the crew of The 9th Age, and everyone who is involved in the development of that great project. See you all on battlefield!

<p>​As gamers in “Crippled God Foundry” we based our modular tile system in the common base size of miniatures and therefore we increased the common square dimensions from 2,5 cm x 2,5 cm to 3cm x 3cm. In this way each flat tile can easily fit 4 miniatures .</p>
<p>In more detail each tile, is 6cm x 6cm, divided into 4 squares of 3cm x 3cm and with 2cm wall height (if there is any). With maximum height of 2 cm, it is easy to move miniatures, dice, and accessories without much effort.</p>

</div></div>","“Crippled God Foundry” is a new company based in Greece created by people who are passionate with role playing games, board games, miniature modeling, painting and sculpting.
We are proud to present our products, the handcrafted modular terrain dungeon tiles and accessories using our best skills in sculpting, molding and casting!
With the mentoring of our associate, master sculptor Michael Kontraros from “Michael Kontraros Collectibles”,  “Crippled God Foundry” brings high detailed modular tile sets and accessories  that enhances the gaming experience of your favorite role playing games!
 


​As gamers in “Crippled God Foundry” we based our modular tile system in the common base size of miniatures and therefore we increased the common square dimensions from 2,5 cm x 2,5 cm to 3cm x 3cm. In this way each flat tile can easily fit 4 miniatures .
In more detail each tile, is 6cm x 6cm, divided into 4 squares of 3cm x 3cm and with 2cm wall height (if there is any). With maximum height of 2 cm, it is easy to move miniatures, dice, and accessories without much effort.
​
- Hand sculpted and hand casted.
- Made from high quality resin.
- Durable, can withstand hard usage.
- Paintable with hobby acrylic paints of your choice.
- Available into two style variations: resin gray or  painted.

- Each Tile comes with and anti slide base to allow a firm grip as you build your scenery. It comes unglued or glued if requested.
​
- Reusable, so with one or more tile sets, can make infinite number of terrain variations!

- Suitable for the heroic scale miniatures and games (25mm-32mm).
 











 











​
Our vision is to deliver best quality and interesting looking terrain, miniatures and accessories for gamers, painters and hobbyists!

<h3 style=""font-weight: big;""><strong>What is Iron Battlefield?</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A new Sci-fi scenery range for 28mm wargames, designed to create heavy and industrial style structures over the battle board, through a highly configurable system for inner and outer game.</p>
<p><strong>Appearance:</strong></p>
<p>This range has been designed to make a realistic industrial environment: dark and metallic colours on main areas, like walls, floors, catwalks, grids... combining with high colourful and special items than provides sophistication to the group, like vivid colour plates, or crystal fences and tiles.</p>
<p>In sum, a metallic and heavy landscape, to recreate an industrial complex, big space hulks, and outer colonial facilities.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<p>The offered sets have a great versatility, both in assembly and use. Designed under the MINEX standard, sectioned parts offer huge advantages:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431025664/eqr8i5ak01oaq8tr1tc2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Compatibility:</strong> all sections, as rooms, corridors, catwalks... are totally compatible. It is not only about the connection possibilities between them, but the different modules can be assembled to maximize the usable space within the same area.</li>
<li>
<strong>Extensible:</strong> in the same way, they will be compatible with any new design, made by us or by another manufacturer as it is designed under the same standards.</li>
<li>
<strong>Easy to paint and mount:</strong> Kits are made in <strong>medium grey pre-painted MDF lasercutted</strong>, and are served with a lot of autoadhesive plates of color and metal textures, and full color stickers. It allows a very easy assembly process, with a nice basic coloured result (just as a new car!!). If you want a more realistic finish, you can get it easily with washes and drybrush technics.</li>
<li>
<strong>Realistic textures:</strong> As well as the basic MDF structure, the kits contains a lot of pieces made of several materials. Fiberglass metal finish grids, very thin and ultra clear crystals, and all kind of metallic appearance plates which will provide you the best results.</li>
<li>
<strong>Versatility:</strong> almost all sections allow several assembly mods, also you can exchange parts with other sections after the main assembly. You will never get bored with this!!</li>
<li>
<strong>Inside and outside options:</strong> With no doubt one of the most interesting feature. Sections can be used externally for a battleground wargame (Warhammer 40.000, Infinity), or internally (Space Hulk mainly), using the disassembled pieces too and enjoying the interior details.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""font-weight: big;""><strong>Why from a campaign?</strong></h3>

<p> </p>
<p>EnCobertura is a Spanish brand since 2007, and has been engaged in the scenery and wargame terrain manufacture. Our main offer has been the natural and geographic items, and also basic battlefields items (walls, ruins...). Now, from our experience on vector works and CNC technologies, we want offer the most ambitious futuristic scenery.</p>

<h3 style=""font-weight: big;""><strong>¿Qué es Iron Battlefield?</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Es nuestra nueva línea de escenografía temática Sci-Fi para wargames en 28mm, que pretende recrear entornos de estructuras pesadas y construcciones de diseño industrial, utilizando un sistema de piezas altamente compatible y configurable para el juego interior y exterior.</p>
<p><strong>Estética:</strong></p>
<p>Esta línea ha sido diseñada para recrear un entorno puramente industrial: tonos oscuros y metálicos en las áreas principales, como paredes, suelos, pasarelas, rejillas... combinados con elementos que aportan color, diseño y sofisticación al conjunto, como paneles en colores vivos, signalética variada, y barandas y baldosas de cristal.</p>
<p>En resumen, un paisaje metálico y pesado, propio de complejos industriales, grandes pecios espaciales, e instalaciones coloniales de exterior.</p>
<p><strong>Funcionalidad:</strong></p>
<p>Las construcciones ofrecidas poseen un alto grado de versatilidad, tanto en montaje como en empleo. Diseñadas bajo nuestro estándar MINEX, las secciones ofrecen las siguientes ventajas:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431025664/eqr8i5ak01oaq8tr1tc2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<div align=""center""><p><font size=""2""><i>Pincha las imágenes para agrandar</i></font></p></div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431026179/jmuosq3devp3fefcbzhp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Compatibilidad:</strong> todas las secciones son compatibles entre ellas, ya sean habitaciones, corredores, pasarelas... Esto no quiere decir solamente que puedan ser conectadas, sino que lo harán respetando unos tamaños y medidas que permitirán la “más comprimida de las configuraciones posible”. Es decir, las secciones se “molestarán” entre ellas lo menos posible a fin de permitir el máximo posicionamiento de piezas en una misma área.</li>
<li>
<strong>Ampliable:</strong> Del mismo modo, serán compatibles con cualquier pieza diseñada en el futuro, por nosotros u otro fabricante gracias a estar diseñado bajo un mismo estándar de fabricación.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fácil de montar y pintar:</strong> Los kits en DM pre-pintado y cortado a láser, y se siven con un montón de láminas autoadhesivas de color y de texturas metálicas, además de acompañarse de pegatinas a todo color. Esto permite un fácil proceso de montaje, con un acabado de color básico muy agradable (¡como un coche nuevo!). Si deseas un acabado más realista, puedes conseguirlo fácilmente a través de sencillas técnicas de aguadas y pincel seco.</li>
<li>
<strong>Texturas realistas:</strong> Además de la estructura en DM, los kits contienen muchas piezas en diversos materiales: Rejillas de fibra de vidrio pero de aspecto metálico, cristales muy finos y ultra transparentes, y todo tipo de láminas de aspecto metálico te ayudarán a conseguir los mejores resultados.</li>
<li>
<strong>Versatilidad:</strong> casi todas las secciones permiten varios modos de montajes básicos, además de la posibilidad de cambiar algunas de sus partes de posición en cualquier momento, o incluso intercambiarlas con partes de otras secciones después del montaje básico. ¡¡Nunca podrás aburrirte con ellas!!</li>
<li>
<strong>Juego para interior y exterior:</strong> tal vez, la principal característica. Las secciones pueden ser utilizadas en juegos de campo abierto (como Warhammer 40.000, Infinity...), y desmontarse parcialmente para ser utilizadas en juegos de interior (como Space Hulk...), dando utilidad a las piezas desmontadas y disfrutando de su detallado interior.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""font-weight: big;""><strong>¿Por qué desde una campaña?</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Recaudar fondos a través de una campaña de mecenazgo nos facilita programar una producción a medio-largo plazo, lo cual nos permite la adquisición de materiales y maquinaria adecuada para una fabricación a un precio muy competitivo.</p>
<p>Además, y como bien es sabido, la oferta a través de un mecenazgo tiene un fuerte poder de convocatoria, ideal para lanzar un proyecto de nueva creación.</p>
<p>Participar en nuestra campaña tendrá ventajas adicionales sobre la futura venta directa: Los artículos son ofrecidos a un precio más competitivo, y los contribuyentes serán incentivados con material adicional a su contribución, ¡¡cuya cantidad irá en aumento según se consigan diferentes metas!!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""font-weight: big;""><strong>¿Y la fecha de entrega?</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Nos gustaría enviar en <strong>Diciembre de este año</strong>, ¡¡procurándoos así unas navidades entretenidas!! Pero no sabemos qué problemas pueden ocurrir, ya que debemos adquirir una cortadora láser nueva, aprender a utilizarla, y optimizar todos los diseños. Por tanto, queremos avisar que el proyecto <strong>puede retrasarse algunos meses</strong>, motivo por el cual, la fecha estimada mostrada en las contribuciones es de <strong>Enero de 2016</strong>.</p>
<p>Obviamente, mantendremos el contacto después del proyecto, actualizando todos los meses como mínimo.</p>
<p>Tened en cuenta que los primeros interesados en entregar somos nosotros, porque eso significa poder publicar más campañas antes, y mantener nuestra reputación.</p>

<h3 style=""font-weight: big;""><strong>Y... ¿es nuestra primera campaña?</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>EnCobertura es una marca española nacida en 2007 dedicada a la fabricación de escenografía y terrenos para wargames. Nuestra principal oferta siempre han sido los elementos naturales y los accidentes geografícos, además de elementos básicos para campos de batalla (muros, ruinas...). Ahora, gracias a nuestra experiencia con el trabajo vectorial y las tecnologías CNC, queremos dedicarnos también a la escenografía futurista más ambiciosa.</p>
<p>Esta no es nuestra primera campaña. Podemos presumir de tener dos campañas presentadas y entregadas en menos de un año, que además generaron una gran satisfacción en nuestros clientes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/armoured-defences/x/3993583"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Amoured Defences</a>:</strong> Nuestra primera campaña de éxito, aunque de muy corto alcance. Realizada en Septiembre de 2013, fue entregada en menos de 4 meses.</li>
<li>
<strong><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/battlefield-operation-ii/x/3993583"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Battlefield Operations II</a>:</strong> Nuestra segunda campaña de éxito, siendo un gran éxito sobre dos intentos fallidos previos, con mayor alcance y recaudación. Realizada a principios de 2014 con una recaudación total de 10.110€, y entregada entre los 6 y 9 meses posteriores a su finalización.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ahora esperamos que Iron Battlefield sea nuestra tercera campaña de éxito, aunque sabemos que será posible ¡gracias a vuestro apoyo y difusión!</p>

What is Iron Battlefield?
 
A new Sci-fi scenery range for 28mm wargames, designed to create heavy and industrial style structures over the battle board, through a highly configurable system for inner and outer game.
Appearance:
This range has been designed to make a realistic industrial environment: dark and metallic colours on main areas, like walls, floors, catwalks, grids... combining with high colourful and special items than provides sophistication to the group, like vivid colour plates, or crystal fences and tiles.
In sum, a metallic and heavy landscape, to recreate an industrial complex, big space hulks, and outer colonial facilities.
Features:
The offered sets have a great versatility, both in assembly and use. Designed under the MINEX standard, sectioned parts offer huge advantages:

Compatibility: all sections, as rooms, corridors, catwalks... are totally compatible. It is not only about the connection possibilities between them, but the different modules can be assembled to maximize the usable space within the same area.

Extensible: in the same way, they will be compatible with any new design, made by us or by another manufacturer as it is designed under the same standards.

Easy to paint and mount: Kits are made in medium grey pre-painted MDF lasercutted, and are served with a lot of autoadhesive plates of color and metal textures, and full color stickers. It allows a very easy assembly process, with a nice basic coloured result (just as a new car!!). If you want a more realistic finish, you can get it easily with washes and drybrush technics.

Realistic textures: As well as the basic MDF structure, the kits contains a lot of pieces made of several materials. Fiberglass metal finish grids, very thin and ultra clear crystals, and all kind of metallic appearance plates which will provide you the best results.

Versatility: almost all sections allow several assembly mods, also you can exchange parts with other sections after the main assembly. You will never get bored with this!!

Inside and outside options: With no doubt one of the most interesting feature. Sections can be used externally for a battleground wargame (Warhammer 40.000, Infinity), or internally (Space Hulk mainly), using the disassembled pieces too and enjoying the interior details.

 
Why from a campaign?
 
To raise money through a crowd funding campaign allow us to schedule for the medium and long term. It help us to get supplies and right machinery for an optimal production and reasonably priced items. Also, everyone knows than crowd funding is a powerful tool for a start-up project.

And... is this our first crowdfunding?
 
EnCobertura is a Spanish brand since 2007, and has been engaged in the scenery and wargame terrain manufacture. Our main offer has been the natural and geographic items, and also basic battlefields items (walls, ruins...). Now, from our experience on vector works and CNC technologies, we want offer the most ambitious futuristic scenery.


Amoured Defences: Our first funded campaign, although not too popular. Finished in September 2013, and all deliveries were completed in less than 4 months.

Battlefield Operations II: Our second funded campaign, was a great success, with higher fundraising response and exposure. It finished in January 2014, raising a total amount of 10.110€, and was delivered within the following 6 to 9 months.

Now we hope that Iron Battlefield gets great results, but we know that it will be possible thanks to your support and help!!

¿Qué es Iron Battlefield?
 
Es nuestra nueva línea de escenografía temática Sci-Fi para wargames en 28mm, que pretende recrear entornos de estructuras pesadas y construcciones de diseño industrial, utilizando un sistema de piezas altamente compatible y configurable para el juego interior y exterior.
Estética:
Esta línea ha sido diseñada para recrear un entorno puramente industrial: tonos oscuros y metálicos en las áreas principales, como paredes, suelos, pasarelas, rejillas... combinados con elementos que aportan color, diseño y sofisticación al conjunto, como paneles en colores vivos, signalética variada, y barandas y baldosas de cristal.
En resumen, un paisaje metálico y pesado, propio de complejos industriales, grandes pecios espaciales, e instalaciones coloniales de exterior.
Funcionalidad:
Las construcciones ofrecidas poseen un alto grado de versatilidad, tanto en montaje como en empleo. Diseñadas bajo nuestro estándar MINEX, las secciones ofrecen las siguientes ventajas:

Pincha las imágenes para agrandar
Pincha las imágenes para agrandar



Compatibilidad: todas las secciones son compatibles entre ellas, ya sean habitaciones, corredores, pasarelas... Esto no quiere decir solamente que puedan ser conectadas, sino que lo harán respetando unos tamaños y medidas que permitirán la “más comprimida de las configuraciones posible”. Es decir, las secciones se “molestarán” entre ellas lo menos posible a fin de permitir el máximo posicionamiento de piezas en una misma área.

Ampliable: Del mismo modo, serán compatibles con cualquier pieza diseñada en el futuro, por nosotros u otro fabricante gracias a estar diseñado bajo un mismo estándar de fabricación.

Fácil de montar y pintar: Los kits en DM pre-pintado y cortado a láser, y se siven con un montón de láminas autoadhesivas de color y de texturas metálicas, además de acompañarse de pegatinas a todo color. Esto permite un fácil proceso de montaje, con un acabado de color básico muy agradable (¡como un coche nuevo!). Si deseas un acabado más realista, puedes conseguirlo fácilmente a través de sencillas técnicas de aguadas y pincel seco.

Texturas realistas: Además de la estructura en DM, los kits contienen muchas piezas en diversos materiales: Rejillas de fibra de vidrio pero de aspecto metálico, cristales muy finos y ultra transparentes, y todo tipo de láminas de aspecto metálico te ayudarán a conseguir los mejores resultados.

Versatilidad: casi todas las secciones permiten varios modos de montajes básicos, además de la posibilidad de cambiar algunas de sus partes de posición en cualquier momento, o incluso intercambiarlas con partes de otras secciones después del montaje básico. ¡¡Nunca podrás aburrirte con ellas!!

Juego para interior y exterior: tal vez, la principal característica. Las secciones pueden ser utilizadas en juegos de campo abierto (como Warhammer 40.000, Infinity...), y desmontarse parcialmente para ser utilizadas en juegos de interior (como Space Hulk...), dando utilidad a las piezas desmontadas y disfrutando de su detallado interior.

 
¿Por qué desde una campaña?
 
Recaudar fondos a través de una campaña de mecenazgo nos facilita programar una producción a medio-largo plazo, lo cual nos permite la adquisición de materiales y maquinaria adecuada para una fabricación a un precio muy competitivo.
Además, y como bien es sabido, la oferta a través de un mecenazgo tiene un fuerte poder de convocatoria, ideal para lanzar un proyecto de nueva creación.
Participar en nuestra campaña tendrá ventajas adicionales sobre la futura venta directa: Los artículos son ofrecidos a un precio más competitivo, y los contribuyentes serán incentivados con material adicional a su contribución, ¡¡cuya cantidad irá en aumento según se consigan diferentes metas!!
 
¿Y la fecha de entrega?
 
Nos gustaría enviar en Diciembre de este año, ¡¡procurándoos así unas navidades entretenidas!! Pero no sabemos qué problemas pueden ocurrir, ya que debemos adquirir una cortadora láser nueva, aprender a utilizarla, y optimizar todos los diseños. Por tanto, queremos avisar que el proyecto puede retrasarse algunos meses, motivo por el cual, la fecha estimada mostrada en las contribuciones es de Enero de 2016.
Obviamente, mantendremos el contacto después del proyecto, actualizando todos los meses como mínimo.
Tened en cuenta que los primeros interesados en entregar somos nosotros, porque eso significa poder publicar más campañas antes, y mantener nuestra reputación.

- VOLVER AL MENÚ PRINCIPAL - Las recompensas son ofrecidas en kits de varias secciones. Cada una muestra un esquema con tales secciones en una distribución aleatoria. Estas son las secciones que encontrarás en cada descripción:

Importante: Por favor, si estás interesado en varios modelos, solicítalos realizando las contribuciones una por una, aunque sean acerca del mismo kit. Sabemos que esto puede ser algo tedioso, pero es fundamental para ayudarnos a procesar el pedido correctamente a través de nuestro sistema de contabilidad. ¡¡Gracias por entenderlo!!
Nota: Las secciones y accesorios que verás son las primeros modelos de este proyecto. Los modelos definitivos pueden variar levemente por motivos de optimización, pero siempre mantendrán el concepto original.

- VOLVER AL MENÚ PRINCIPAL - Además del DM cortado a láser, todos los kits incluyen láminas autoadhesivas para el interior de todas las secciones, proveyendo los diferentes diseños mostrados en la misma cantidad. Igualmente ocurre con las baldosas: se proveerán más que suficientes para cada kit, y de diferentes tipos y diseños para distintas combinaciones. El acabado básico del exterior de las secciones es metálico. Ofrecemos cinco opciones de color (rojo, azul, verde, amarillo y naranja) que puedes adquirir a través de las contribuciones de ""LÁMINAS DE COLOR"". Y por supuesto, instrucciones suficiente para el montaje correcto.  Pincha las imágenes para agrandar. Respecto a los detalles y las piezas ""difíciles de contar"", los kits contienen (Pincha las imágenes para agrandar):
- 3x pantallas de cristal de color (rojo, azul y verde) por cada corredor de 4 casillas (¡puedes ponerlas donde quieras!).  - 2x ventanas de cristal (diseño ""Area 19"" en rojo, ¡pero aparecerán más!) por cada habitación de 3x3 casillas con 2 accesos en L (puedes montarlos también en cualquier espacio de 3 casillas).  - Los diferentes modelos de esquinas de resina (5) serán suministrados en el mismo número, teniendo cada kit suficientes.  - Todas las secciones tendrán 1x puerta (cuando haya 2 ó 3 accesos) ó 2x puertas (cuando haya 4 accesos). Los diseños actuales (3) serán suministrados en el mismo número.  - 1x piezas de tuberías de ""3 casillas de longitud"" por cada ""corredor de 3 casillas"" y 1x piezas de tuberías de ""2 casillas de longitud"" por cada ""corredor de 2 casillas"".   - 1x kit de maquinaria por cada ""habitación de 3x3 casillas y 4 accesos"" (que podrás poner donde quieras...).  - Un montón de etiquetas muy chulas de peligro y otra signalética.  - Y por último, suficientes barandas para todas las construcciones y pasarelas (las construcciones tienen mamparos de cristal y las pasarelas de tipo ""pasamanos""). 
 

 
- VOLVER AL MENÚ PRINCIPAL - Todos los contribuyentes recibirán regalos adicionales por cada meta que nos ayuden a alcanzar.

Y... ¿es nuestra primera campaña?
 
EnCobertura es una marca española nacida en 2007 dedicada a la fabricación de escenografía y terrenos para wargames. Nuestra principal oferta siempre han sido los elementos naturales y los accidentes geografícos, además de elementos básicos para campos de batalla (muros, ruinas...). Ahora, gracias a nuestra experiencia con el trabajo vectorial y las tecnologías CNC, queremos dedicarnos también a la escenografía futurista más ambiciosa.
Esta no es nuestra primera campaña. Podemos presumir de tener dos campañas presentadas y entregadas en menos de un año, que además generaron una gran satisfacción en nuestros clientes:


Amoured Defences: Nuestra primera campaña de éxito, aunque de muy corto alcance. Realizada en Septiembre de 2013, fue entregada en menos de 4 meses.

Battlefield Operations II: Nuestra segunda campaña de éxito, siendo un gran éxito sobre dos intentos fallidos previos, con mayor alcance y recaudación. Realizada a principios de 2014 con una recaudación total de 10.110€, y entregada entre los 6 y 9 meses posteriores a su finalización.

Ahora esperamos que Iron Battlefield sea nuestra tercera campaña de éxito, aunque sabemos que será posible ¡gracias a vuestro apoyo y difusión!",124.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<p>Space Princess is an elegant strategy game for two.  Play as the Space Princess and use wits, holograms, and your trusty blaster to evade the forces of evil and escape the star cruiser. Or play as the Dark Zealot, controlling troopers and sinister powers to trap the Space Princess before she escapes. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>""This is a really great two-player game! It's tense and well-balanced! It's been awesome watching the game evolve and seeing the passion put into this project.""</h3>
<h3>- Jonathan Gilmour, designer of <i>Dead of Winter</i>
</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The game was inspired by our favorite space princess, Carrie Fisher. We are releasing it to honor her memory and inspire new heroes to follow in her footsteps.  You can be a hero by helping us make Space Princess a reality. Each pledge to our campaign contributes to a donation to the International Bipolar Foundation, a world organization that promotes education and awareness of bipolar disorder and offers support to families affected by it.  The cause was supported by Ms. Fisher, and is especially relevant to members of our team whose family members have struggled with bipolar disorder.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:  We have exceeded our charity goal of $1000!  THANK YOU!!!! </strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to raise at least $1000 for the International Bipolar Foundation. For each pledge, Nerdy Pup Games will donate its share from the cost of the game to the cause.</p>
<p>Help us support an important cause, and experience a terrific game as a reward!</p>

<h3>""A clever and quick strategy game with meaningful decisions that allow me to play the player as well as the game."" </h3>
<h3>- Jon Mietling, designer of <i>Palm Island </i>
</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Space Princess is a fast but challenging strategy game for two players.  Each player has a unique set of action cards that makes both sides fun and interesting to play. The goal of the Space Princess is to reach one of two escape pods on the board in order to escape the star cruiser. The Dark Zealot's goal is to capture the Space Princess before she can escape. </p>
<p>Cards are laid out to create the floorplan of the Dark Zealot's starcruiser.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519493611/dezuaakhnsuc0u5ahws8.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>On a turn:</strong><br/>Both players draw 2 action cards from their deck, and choose 1 action to play simultaneously. The remaining card goes to the bottom of their deck.</p>
<p>Players reveal their chosen cards, and resolve them in order value, lowest to highest.</p>
<p>The Space Princess action cards allow her to move and rotate doors to make her way to an escape pod. She can fire her trusty blaster at troopers.  In a pinch, she can place a Hologram as a decoy or Hide, disappearing from the board for a turn.</p>
<p>The Dark Zealot action cards allow him to move himself and his troopers to outflank the Princess.  Troopers can fire at the Princess if they have a clear shot, and the Zealot can capture the Princess if he moves into her space. The Zealot can use his dark powers to Sense, playing a discarded card after the Princess reveals her action, or seal a door shut using the Lock.</p>
<p>The game ends when either the Princess reaches an escape pod or the Zealot captures her.</p>
<p>Space Princess is a game of cat-and-mouse, and typically takes 15 to 20 mins to play. Small, portable, and easy to set up, you can take Space Princess with you anywhere you go and have minutes or hours of challenging play to suit your needs.</p>

<p>International Bipolar Foundation (IBPF) was founded in June 2007 in San Diego, California by four parents with children affected by bipolar disorder. Well aware of the trauma that bipolar disorder causes for consumers and their families, these parents felt compelled to do something constructive to help.</p>
<p>About 5.7 million American adults, or about 2.6 percent of the population, age 18 and older in any given year, have bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder typically develops in late adolescence or early adulthood. However, some people have their first symptoms during childhood, and some develop them late in life. It is often not recognized as an illness, and people may suffer for years before it is properly diagnosed and treated. Like diabetes or heart disease, bipolar disorder is a long-term illness that must be carefully managed throughout a person’s life (National Institute of Mental Health).</p>
<p>You can learn more about IBPF and bipolar disorder by visiting their website at <a href=""http://ibpf.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ibpf.org</a>.</p>

<p>Space Princess is the first game released by Nerdy Pup Games.  Typically, a first game could mean a lot of lessons learned on our part as we navigate manufacturing and shipping and other new challenges. However, we hope to avoid many potential first-time issues by using the print-on-demand service, The Game Crafter, for manufacturing and handling of our bulk orders.  All images of the game on the campaign site are copies of the game printed by The Game Crafter, and our experience with shipping from them has been timely and dependable.</p>
<p>The game itself is rules-complete, and has undergone a year of playtesting at Unpub and with local design groups. Art and graphic design are also complete.  If our campaign is successful, we are ready to place an order with the manufacturer and have the game shipped directly to you.</p>
<p>Our campaign is set to end on April 5th.  If we are successful, we expect funds to release from Indiegogo within three weeks.  At the end of April, we plan to post live on Twitter and Facebook as we make the donation to IBPF so that all of our supporters can share in the warm fuzzies!</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why Indiegogo, and not Kickstarter?</h3>
<p>Indiegogo offers a great platform for funding and has no restrictions on charitable campaigns. Kickstarter is regarded as a destination platform for board games, but its site rules prohibit campaigns with a charitable component. We are proud to join the Indiegogo community and offer backers a chance to not only support a great game, but also a great cause.</p>
<p> </p>

</div></div>","Space Princess is an elegant strategy game for two.  Play as the Space Princess and use wits, holograms, and your trusty blaster to evade the forces of evil and escape the star cruiser. Or play as the Dark Zealot, controlling troopers and sinister powers to trap the Space Princess before she escapes. 
 
""This is a really great two-player game! It's tense and well-balanced! It's been awesome watching the game evolve and seeing the passion put into this project.""
- Jonathan Gilmour, designer of Dead of Winter

 
The game was inspired by our favorite space princess, Carrie Fisher. We are releasing it to honor her memory and inspire new heroes to follow in her footsteps.  You can be a hero by helping us make Space Princess a reality. Each pledge to our campaign contributes to a donation to the International Bipolar Foundation, a world organization that promotes education and awareness of bipolar disorder and offers support to families affected by it.  The cause was supported by Ms. Fisher, and is especially relevant to members of our team whose family members have struggled with bipolar disorder.
UPDATE:  We have exceeded our charity goal of $1000!  THANK YOU!!!! 
Our goal is to raise at least $1000 for the International Bipolar Foundation. For each pledge, Nerdy Pup Games will donate its share from the cost of the game to the cause.
Help us support an important cause, and experience a terrific game as a reward!
 


 

 
""A clever and quick strategy game with meaningful decisions that allow me to play the player as well as the game."" 
- Jon Mietling, designer of Palm Island 

 
Space Princess is a fast but challenging strategy game for two players.  Each player has a unique set of action cards that makes both sides fun and interesting to play. The goal of the Space Princess is to reach one of two escape pods on the board in order to escape the star cruiser. The Dark Zealot's goal is to capture the Space Princess before she can escape. 
Cards are laid out to create the floorplan of the Dark Zealot's starcruiser.

On a turn:Both players draw 2 action cards from their deck, and choose 1 action to play simultaneously. The remaining card goes to the bottom of their deck.
Players reveal their chosen cards, and resolve them in order value, lowest to highest.
The Space Princess action cards allow her to move and rotate doors to make her way to an escape pod. She can fire her trusty blaster at troopers.  In a pinch, she can place a Hologram as a decoy or Hide, disappearing from the board for a turn.
The Dark Zealot action cards allow him to move himself and his troopers to outflank the Princess.  Troopers can fire at the Princess if they have a clear shot, and the Zealot can capture the Princess if he moves into her space. The Zealot can use his dark powers to Sense, playing a discarded card after the Princess reveals her action, or seal a door shut using the Lock.
The game ends when either the Princess reaches an escape pod or the Zealot captures her.
Space Princess is a game of cat-and-mouse, and typically takes 15 to 20 mins to play. Small, portable, and easy to set up, you can take Space Princess with you anywhere you go and have minutes or hours of challenging play to suit your needs.

International Bipolar Foundation (IBPF) was founded in June 2007 in San Diego, California by four parents with children affected by bipolar disorder. Well aware of the trauma that bipolar disorder causes for consumers and their families, these parents felt compelled to do something constructive to help.
About 5.7 million American adults, or about 2.6 percent of the population, age 18 and older in any given year, have bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder typically develops in late adolescence or early adulthood. However, some people have their first symptoms during childhood, and some develop them late in life. It is often not recognized as an illness, and people may suffer for years before it is properly diagnosed and treated. Like diabetes or heart disease, bipolar disorder is a long-term illness that must be carefully managed throughout a person’s life (National Institute of Mental Health).
You can learn more about IBPF and bipolar disorder by visiting their website at ibpf.org.

Space Princess is the first game released by Nerdy Pup Games.  Typically, a first game could mean a lot of lessons learned on our part as we navigate manufacturing and shipping and other new challenges. However, we hope to avoid many potential first-time issues by using the print-on-demand service, The Game Crafter, for manufacturing and handling of our bulk orders.  All images of the game on the campaign site are copies of the game printed by The Game Crafter, and our experience with shipping from them has been timely and dependable.
The game itself is rules-complete, and has undergone a year of playtesting at Unpub and with local design groups. Art and graphic design are also complete.  If our campaign is successful, we are ready to place an order with the manufacturer and have the game shipped directly to you.
Our campaign is set to end on April 5th.  If we are successful, we expect funds to release from Indiegogo within three weeks.  At the end of April, we plan to post live on Twitter and Facebook as we make the donation to IBPF so that all of our supporters can share in the warm fuzzies!
 


You can help support our campaign by sharing on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to help spread the word about the game and the cause.  You can also use Indiegogo's share tools to help others find the campaign.
Thanks again for your support! 
 
Frequently Asked Questions
 
Why Indiegogo, and not Kickstarter?
Indiegogo offers a great platform for funding and has no restrictions on charitable campaigns. Kickstarter is regarded as a destination platform for board games, but its site rules prohibit campaigns with a charitable component. We are proud to join the Indiegogo community and offer backers a chance to not only support a great game, but also a great cause.
 
Can I give more than the Perk level ($5, $25, or $45) to the campaign?
Yes.  Any funds collected beyond the selected Perk level contribute directly to the donation made by Nerdy Pup Games to the International Bipolar Foundation.  Indiegogo collects a 5% fee on all funds given through the platform, so keep in mind that the 5% platform fee will be applied to the entire amount you give.",13.0,0,"1 Campaign

INTERVIEW WITH DIRK DE POL ABOUT KEYANDO  Thanks to Alexia Anastasio! Check out her projects on www.alexiaanastasio.com. WHAT DO TESTERS AND GAMERS THINK ABOUT KEYANDO?António and Dirk would like to thank all beta-testers, friends, gamers, life coaches, trainers and supporters who helped us fine-tune the Keyando cards, rules and routines. Some of them even came up with ideas for new rules and spreads. Here are some of their statements.""What a great game! The world needs more traditions where people can reflect on their own lives and bond with others."" Adam Baltieri, Berlin.""Playing with the Keyando beta cards now! This game is a great idea! Great energy! Thanks Dirk!"" Kirk G., Arizona.""Dirk, I like the concept. Keyando deserves to be heard by many people."" Rukesh Patel, Pune India. ""I played the game two times. I was amazed how quickly I could get to know people who where totally strangers to me before the first time I played it. Second time I was with a group of friends when Dirk came to introduce us the game. While playing the conversation shifted to another level of intimacy. Everybody in the group was included to the conversation and game. I loved to see their smiling faces and to get to know them better then before."" Reinhard Clemens, Berlin. ""I think it's a very versatile game/tool to get to know one another. I realized too, everyone wants to be disconnected and be entertained but not really participate. This is what the generation needs. Let's get this thing moving and shared on social media! And the art is really nice too."" Brandon Roots, Citrus Heights, CA.""I love it! Everyone at the table really opens up. Even our teenage kids..."" Lore T., Long Island.Thanks to Spielwiese Berlin""I'm not a fan of classic tabletop games, but Keyando should be in your cabinet. It is a game in which, through skillful questions, we can squeeze out funny, embarrassing or sometimes even intimate truths from our friends ... all participants try to surpass themselves and more and more new aspects come to daylight. I was thrilled and we played several rounds. The depth during the game was enormous!"" Dominik Birke, Nürnberg.""If we throw these cards into the circle of playful friends or strangers, in only a few minutes we will learn about things from which we have had no idea, and we will know exactly who we want to see more often or never again ... I have not experienced so much wild discussion, laughter, and shouting in the last few years, as in this game ..."" Yvonne Bloesch, Berlin.""Such beautiful artwork and a game for sharing thoughts and strategies for mindfulness and happiness - perfect game!"" Ercan Tekce, Berlin. ""Thrilling! All the fun comes from the contributions and stories of the co-players. So, like in real life: with the selection of interesting players the pleasure doubles. From hearty laughter to tears there are all emotions. Through the frame the game sets, the conversations remained playful despite the depth and the whole group took part. Thus, both extroverted and introverted people were encouraged to participate in the game..."" Jens Berggreen, Hamburg.""Today I finally had the opportunity to play Keyando. All the players (trainers and coaches) were very impressed. It is a great tool to get into deeper exchange and offers a lot of creative possibilities to invent own questions and approaches. We find the cards very stimulating and imaginative. We had fun and recommend it and continue to play!"" Katherina H., Berlin.   THE KEYANDO CARDS  Here you can see our high-quality large format cards (7x12 cm / 2,76x4,7 inch) in comparison with standard poker cards and other playing cards.  Comparison of Card Sizes and Boxes / Lumex PrintWe’ve created all cards in high-resolution, even suitable for poster or canvas prints.   THE RULES OF THE GAME OF HAPPINESSAt the beginning of the game, all players get 5 cards. Whoever plays all his cards first, wins. Going clockwise, the player next to the dealer starts the game. When it’s your turn you have one of the following options: ASKLay down a card in front of a co-player and ask him anything you like about it.ASKFor example, when you play the “Challenges” card, you could ask: “What means this card to you?”, or more specific: “What was your biggest challenge?” Your imagination is your only limit here. Especially when you play an angel or vampire card which can represent whatever you like, and allows you to ask whatever you want.If you are satisfied with the answer, your card stays on the table and the player asked plays next as a reward. If the answer is refused the player asked has to draw a card from the pile and you must withdraw your card and it will be the next player’s turn. LAYInstead of asking or telling something you can simply lay down a card that fits to one which is already on the table. One objective is to arrange the cards played in 4 rows of 12 cards each. The cards form a puzzle with a landscape on it.LAYIt is possible to lay down several matching cards at once. If “Winning” is one of your keys to happiness this might be a good way to go.THAT’S IT! MORE OR LESS … THERE ARE SOME MORE THINGS TO CONSIDER. STOP A TURNWhen it’s getting out of hand or when someone is just about to win you can use a joker (angel or vampire) at any time, and then the next person clockwise will be on!Important: If you interrupt a turn all cards played in that turn have to be taken back. Most likely some co-players will not be happy about that… STRATEGYPart of the fun is to develop your own strategy in this highly dynamic game. No game will be the same, so it will keep you on your toes.Angel and vampire cards are the most powerful cards in the game. They can stop any game situation, and the can represent whatever you like, when you are asking or telling something. END OF THE GAMEWhoever plays all his cards first, wins! However, if you forget to shout „Keyando!“ at the end, you have to take back your last card (or cards) and you get an additional card from the pile!Yikes!SOUNDS LIKE FUN? THEN SUPPORT US! THE PERKS  WHAT ARE YOU FUNDING?

The keys to your happiness are unique. The reason for this is simple. We all grow up in different families and environments, within diverse societies, cultures and historical backgrounds. Our unique experiences make us who we are; the situations and dramas we live through are never the same. We have different genes and character traits that contribute to the complex whole of our personality— and at every given moment we find ourselves in different phases of our personal development.No matter how we use the Keyando cards, they will take on the flavor of our own creativity, thoughts, and wishes. Using the Keyando cards as a game or guide to self-discovery puts us in touch with the keys to our happiness, opening the way to integrating them into our lives so that we can find balance, achieve our goals, and create more satisfaction for ourselves and others. How can the Keyando Cards be used for more Mindfulness, Happiness and Tarot?Here just a few examples of what we can do with the Keyando cards: The Wheel of LifeThe Wheel of Life is a common tool for creating more balance in your life and rethinking and setting your goals. Using the Wheel of Life as a starting point, allows you to reflect how satisfied you are in the different areas of your life.What you see above is an example setup of a nearly balanced Wheel of Life with the areas growth, love, friendship, family, security, health, working, and faith.The Wheel is based on a scoring system from 1 to 10. Simply reflect and rate your satisfaction levels for each area out of 10, where 1 is closest to the center.How you can work with the Keyando cards and the Wheel of Life in order to improve an important area of your life or to define your goals more clearly is described in the Keyando-Booklet in detail. My KeysMy Keys is about answering the question: “What are my keys to happiness?”Shuffle the cards and place one after the other face up on the table. Place the cards to the top which appear important for you. Place a card at the bottom of table if you think is not that important to you.Make up your mind about each card within 3 seconds, decide spontaneously.When you’re done, take your time to look on the cards on the top and select just 7 cards of which you think that these are your essential happiness keys.Congrats, you just detected your individual set of keys to happiness!If you like you can relate them to your goals or areas of life which you like to improve. InspirationsShuffle the cards and then lay down the first 12 cards face up on the table. Select 3 of the 12 cards of which you think that they are important in your current situation or for the near future. Place these cards in a row.Shuffle the remaining cards and place one after another below one of the 3 cards in the row. Place cards that do not fit to just to the side.After you assigned all cards, try to find a hierarchy for the cards in each column. Inspirations allows you identify potential challenges and manage them. THE TEAMAntónio Piedade: António (featured on the faith card) is a professional artist, and is responsible for illustrating the Keyando cards.

<p>Hi, I’m Anastasia, the owner and creator of <a href=""http://tiny-furniture.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tiny Furniture</a>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_400/v1537120417/ydhushttavqxsflwhefq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>For about three years, our small team, has been creating, producing and painting unique miniature accessories for tabletop gaming. We have a huge assortment of small-scale furniture already available; bookshelves, a medieval bakery, tavern accessories, beds, tables, chairs, building accessories, and many other unique miniatures.</p>
<p>With your help and this crowdfunding campaign, we want to blaze a new trail for Tiny Furniture… the creation of miniature characters who live in our small worlds.</p>
<p>The market already has a considerable number of figures to represent the traditional adventurer (knights, wizards, orcs, elves, etc). They fight in battles, defeat the dragons, delve deep into the dungeons, uncover the lost lore and mighty artifacts, sometimes they die heroically… sometimes not so heroically. These are the stories that we tell with miniatures.</p>
<p>But they are never the only actors on the stage. There is a need for the person to be rescued, the one to give the quest or pass on some vital rumor or clue. Someone needs to stand behind the market stall, serve in the church, steal an unguarded coin purse, beg, bake, and entertain. In short, your cities need to breath and be alive.</p>
<p>So, we set out to make our Tiny Villagers. Together with our partners from <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Evocatusmini/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Evocatus Miniature</a> we have custom designed and developed a 3D line of medieval civilans.</p>
<p>All figures will be printed on a high-quality 3D printer and cast in resin. We already have some of this line completely ready, and would like to ask for support in finishing the line.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support and happy adventuring.</p>
<p>Anastasia.</p>

<h3><strong>1. Young Noble *UNLOCKED*</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537119826/styqefh5ctnv7rbivvy7.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The young nobleman put down his feather, sealed the letter in an envelope and secured it with a wax seal. He called the servant and said: ""Take this letter to the market square and give it to a girl named Angelina, who usually stands at the corner near the stall with vegetables."" Looking out the window at the messenger, running across the street, the young duke thought: ""Mother will not approve of my choice. As always.""</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>2. Old Widow *UNLOCKED*</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537119798/rvnmmrp1cs7nggrqgl9y.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>“I FORBID IT!” - shrieked the Noblewoman.</p>
<p>The nearby servants turned their heads and pretended to go about their work. Lowering her voice to a whisper, but not tempering her fury: “ I forbid you to go hunting. Do you not remember the last time you were nearly gored to death?”</p>
<p>“But Mother, I...” - stammered the young Noble.</p>
<p>“Go to your studies. Forget going hunting. Forget your silly little whore.” - replied the Dowager Duchess, indicating that the conversation was over. <br/>“She’s not a whore!” - the young Noble yelled as he stormed away up the stairs to his room.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>3. Thief  <strong>*UNLOCKED*</strong>

<p>With a predatory glance, Derrick had been watching the young and carefree Nobleman for several blocks. The Noble was currently stopped at a stall selling Persian carpets. Previously he had gone into a perfume shop, a flower shop, a chocolatier, and one of those clothing stores that sold those silly impractical frilly outfits that the grossly rich always seemed to be wearing. The Noble was clearly trying to impress someone… a woman perhaps. His pouch still bulged quite nicely even after all of that spending. This man’s excessiveness irked Derrick, whose daughter Mika had complained just this morning that all they had to eat was moldy corn tortillas. All morning, Derrick had been following the Noble like a secondary shadow, and now he was just waiting for the right moment to strike. Licking his fingers and warming them up, Derrick hid a short, wicked blade in his sleeve and began closing with his target like a shark drawn to blood. Mika would have meat for dinner tonight… and for the rest of the month… maybe even a new dress. </p>

<p>Brother Gregor stood at the walls of the cathedral and gazed attentively upwards while nervously rubbing the smooth wooden beads of his rosary between his hard-calloused hands. His long journey from his small monastery in the mountains had worn on him more than he thought it would. Three days past his sandals had fallen apart, and he had continued the journey barefoot. His food had run out a day ago. Gregor was exhausted but had urgent business that he needed to speak with the Bishop about. Now he stood patiently awaiting the appearance of the Bishop and soon he joined the rapidly growing crowd that had gathered for the day’s sermon. The appearance of His High Holiness with his golden staff consecrated in Rome renewed Gregor’s strength and determination.</p>

<p>The old man, in his dirty rags, was sitting in the mud just outside of the tavern. Staring at the sun through the dirty glass of the bottle that he had emptied hours ago; it’s reflection causing him to squint. Lamenting, his mind wandered to better days. Half a century ago, Archie… then Archibald III was a young man of considerable wealth. Born of noble blood, an owner of a large estate, his life was one of luxury. Then he had a whole cellar filled with the finest wines and liquors to be had. Back then he didn’t believe that his life could be any better, and then fate stepped in and introduced him to the love of his life, the lovely daughter of the Viceroy to the King himself. Countless were the times that he would ride to their castle on the hill, a dashing figure on his magnificent black courser Tempest. He showered her in expensive gifts, reading reams of poetry and forever proclaiming his eternal love. Paulina, was her name; and they had spent several secretive nights in each other’s embrace. Often talking of eloping together. One beautiful spring day, Archibald came to the castle, planning on that being the night that they would run away together. But the guards did not let him enter the castle, turning him away after a scuffle. Archibald vowed to return the very next day, but by then it was too late. Paulina, the reason he drew breath, had been married to another. The months after that are still a blur to Archie… his influential father died in a war, his mother soon after of heartbreak or the plague he wasn’t sure. Most of that time Archie was drunk or getting drunk. He drowned his pain in the wine cellar of his families’ estate. One night, the estate burned down under mysterious circumstances. Soon afterwards he was stripped of his lands and family title. Penniless, loveless, and with nowhere to go Archie retreated to the one place he felt safe… the bottom of a bottle. A shadow fell over him, snapping him hazily back to reality… please don’t let it be Rufus and his gang. I copper coin landed in his lap. Above him towered the young Nobleman that lived on the hill with his widower mother. The dashing young man in a beautiful feathered beret, flashed a grin and squatted to meet his eye. “Archie! Why so glum? It’s a beautiful day, full of promise and love. Go my friend, have a beer on me.” Stumbling to his feet, Archie, bowed with gratitude. “Thank you, my Lord,” he managed to stammer. As the young man walked away, Archie smiled to himself as he flipped the coin in the air. Something in the face of that young noble reminded Archie of himself when he was a lad.</p>

<h3>6. The Hermit <strong>*UNLOCKED*</strong>
</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537120113/pdbsk0kyksf99pte6ltj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Ivor, ""Old Ivor"" to some, comes into town hunched over under the weight of his burden every Sunday. His huge wicker bag is filled to the brim with berries that he collects in the woods. He sets himself up off to the side as not to be in the way of other sellers. Ivor does a fairly brisk business as he sells his berries for a pittance; Ivor is not really interested in making a profit. The reason that Ivor comes to town every week is because he wants to see his estranged daughter. Many years ago she left home, breaking off all contact with him and moved to the city. Her dream was to become a famous actress, working in the city's prestigious theater district. But life had other plans for her; she had fallen on hard times, and now Ivor watches with sadness in his eyes. Seeing his beautiful daughter, dressed as a harlot, attracting customers to a city brothel breaks his heart.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>7. Gipsy and Boris <strong>*UNLOCKED*</strong>
</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537120160/cmw6zidspnkwaxa425ca.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Unhooking the chain the man, with the magnificent black mustache, removed the muzzle from the bear. ""Well, Boris, it was a hard day, but now it's time for rest"", as he gently stroked the bear behind the ears. Boris shook his massive frame, grateful to be free of the muzzle, and rubbed his warm nose against the man's palm.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>8. Apple seller <strong>*UNLOCKED*</strong>

<p>Marko has always loved prose, in his youth he had been a flashy poet with some promise. But sadly, these days it seemed that people no longer needed beautiful princesses and their brave knights; or at least didn’t want to pay for them. To feed his family Marko purchased a small piece of land, seeded it with apples and worked from sunup to sunset. Over the years he came to appreciate the beauty and unspoken poetry of growing apples. The feeling of the sunrise on his face, the pattern of sweat as it ran from his brow, the smell of a hot pie made with his apples, the smile of a child as they bit into one of his apples. These were all things as worthy of a ballad as any knight to Marko now. Today he is happy coming to the local market and singing the praises of his labor of love; creating beautiful rhymes about his sweet and juicy apples.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>9. Bishop <strong>*UNLOCKED*</strong>
</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537208676/zworzheh41p9klcw0two.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>From the cathedral baclony, bishop could see the crowds swarming about the market square below. The remnants of his recent meal - rich and dripping with lard - still shone on his chin as he sluggishly thought: ""Seems the city is growing , an increase in the tithe may be in order"".</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>
<strong>10. </strong>Courtesan <strong>*UNLOCKED*</strong>
</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537208737/qrs45gs0rqu7ft4ussmd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The out of breath servant handed Angelina the letter and hurried off as not to be seen. She was right where his master had said she would be standing on the corner of the market square next to the vegetable stall. The beautiful young courtesan smiled and coyly brought the envelope to her perfect little nose. Closing her eyes, she breathed in deeply the smell of the young noble’s expensive perfume. Slowly she traced the outline of the family crest in the seal, and abruptly she tore the letter unread into several pieces and threw it into a pile of rotting vegetables that had accumulated nearby.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>11. Herald <strong>*UNLOCKED*</strong>
</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537208776/yy9qhh170nmhrvnscf5e.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Leaving the Cathedral’s heavy iron gates to close behind him, the Herald tucked the large scroll with the Bishop’s new decree under his arm and hurried on his way. Taking a shortcut though the back alleys, he quickly headed towards the town’s square. The smell of the market made him glad that had just recently cleaned his jacket. Cleaning it had not been cheap; but the special herbs that the washer used overpowered the smells of city life, and Belinda loved the scent. Stepping quickly to avoid a pool of what was possibly urine and rotting tomatoes, the Herald ascended the stairs. Taking his place and unfolding the scroll, he quickly scanned the text. Clearing his voice, the Herald spoke loud enough to be heard by all, “Here ye! Hear ye! A proclamation to all good citizens from his Most Holy Excellency. Be it known by all that there will be an increase in church tithes that will take place starting this holy day…” Looking around the courtyard at the crowd of on-lookers that had gathered for their reaction. Did that woman just pick up a rotten tomato out of that urine pool? Letting out a sigh, he resigned himself to wash his beautiful jacket yet again.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>12. Carpet merchant  <strong>*UNLOCKED*</strong>
</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537208795/xmz7osaciobzpmoek9ag.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The market was abuzz with all manner of sights, sounds and smells. It was a busy day and business should be brisk. Nabir, however did not share in the excitement that surrounded him. For the tenth time in as many minutes he cursed under his breath, “It is already the fifth hour since I’ve opened and have not sold a single carpet. Curse my luck, and curse these people.” Looking around at the other stalls doing a vigorous business Nabir whispered, “I should have listened to my beloved Elaheh… next time I bring a caravan of dry figs and curcuma.”</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>13. Peasant girl  <strong>*UNLOCKED*</strong>
</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537208817/row3vx7hjrkqaj64wiw0.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The young girl, in the simply cut but neatly maintained dress, danced in and out of the swirling mass of humanity that is the marketplace. Deftly jumping a puddle, ducking under a low stall beam, a swirl of the skirt and she was around an upended cart. Where ever she went smiles and greetings followed her, all of which she returned in kind. People were always glad to see Agnes, and not because she worked for the old noble widow on the hill, but because she was a gentle soul. Arriving at her destination, the vegetable merchant smiled broadly as she approached. After greeting the merchant, Agnes began her inspection of the pumpkins and cabbages. After choosing the best available, she waited while the merchant worked his abacus. “Eight pence” the merchant said. Agnes frowned slightly, “Not five days ago this would have only been four pence,” narrowing her eyes she continued, “this seems a little greedy to me Peter.” The merchant looked at the ground, and nudged some dirt with his boot, “I’m sorry Agnes, but I cannot sell my vegetables at my old prices anymore. Last week the Bishop almost doubled the church tithe. I cannot survive and feed my own family at that loss.” Agnes sighed, some of the light leaving her face. Resigned, she put the cabbage back on the stall, shook her head and thought, “My lady will surely curse me again.”</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks and challenges</h3>

<p>We cast miniatures in resin. And it is an intensive manual labor without any automatization.

</div><div><h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3></div></div>","Hi, I’m Anastasia, the owner and creator of Tiny Furniture.

For about three years, our small team, has been creating, producing and painting unique miniature accessories for tabletop gaming. We have a huge assortment of small-scale furniture already available; bookshelves, a medieval bakery, tavern accessories, beds, tables, chairs, building accessories, and many other unique miniatures.
With your help and this crowdfunding campaign, we want to blaze a new trail for Tiny Furniture… the creation of miniature characters who live in our small worlds.
The market already has a considerable number of figures to represent the traditional adventurer (knights, wizards, orcs, elves, etc). They fight in battles, defeat the dragons, delve deep into the dungeons, uncover the lost lore and mighty artifacts, sometimes they die heroically… sometimes not so heroically. These are the stories that we tell with miniatures.
But they are never the only actors on the stage. There is a need for the person to be rescued, the one to give the quest or pass on some vital rumor or clue. Someone needs to stand behind the market stall, serve in the church, steal an unguarded coin purse, beg, bake, and entertain. In short, your cities need to breath and be alive.
So, we set out to make our Tiny Villagers. Together with our partners from Evocatus Miniature we have custom designed and developed a 3D line of medieval civilans.
All figures will be printed on a high-quality 3D printer and cast in resin. We already have some of this line completely ready, and would like to ask for support in finishing the line.
Thank you for your support and happy adventuring.
Anastasia.
 

Miniatures
 
1. Young Noble *UNLOCKED*

The young nobleman put down his feather, sealed the letter in an envelope and secured it with a wax seal. He called the servant and said: ""Take this letter to the market square and give it to a girl named Angelina, who usually stands at the corner near the stall with vegetables."" Looking out the window at the messenger, running across the street, the young duke thought: ""Mother will not approve of my choice. As always.""
 
2. Old Widow *UNLOCKED*

“I FORBID IT!” - shrieked the Noblewoman.
The nearby servants turned their heads and pretended to go about their work. Lowering her voice to a whisper, but not tempering her fury: “ I forbid you to go hunting. Do you not remember the last time you were nearly gored to death?”
“But Mother, I...” - stammered the young Noble.
“Go to your studies. Forget going hunting. Forget your silly little whore.” - replied the Dowager Duchess, indicating that the conversation was over. “She’s not a whore!” - the young Noble yelled as he stormed away up the stairs to his room.
 
3. Thief  *UNLOCKED*


With a predatory glance, Derrick had been watching the young and carefree Nobleman for several blocks. The Noble was currently stopped at a stall selling Persian carpets. Previously he had gone into a perfume shop, a flower shop, a chocolatier, and one of those clothing stores that sold those silly impractical frilly outfits that the grossly rich always seemed to be wearing. The Noble was clearly trying to impress someone… a woman perhaps. His pouch still bulged quite nicely even after all of that spending. This man’s excessiveness irked Derrick, whose daughter Mika had complained just this morning that all they had to eat was moldy corn tortillas. All morning, Derrick had been following the Noble like a secondary shadow, and now he was just waiting for the right moment to strike. Licking his fingers and warming them up, Derrick hid a short, wicked blade in his sleeve and began closing with his target like a shark drawn to blood. Mika would have meat for dinner tonight… and for the rest of the month… maybe even a new dress. 
 
4. Monk *UNLOCKED*


Brother Gregor stood at the walls of the cathedral and gazed attentively upwards while nervously rubbing the smooth wooden beads of his rosary between his hard-calloused hands. His long journey from his small monastery in the mountains had worn on him more than he thought it would. Three days past his sandals had fallen apart, and he had continued the journey barefoot. His food had run out a day ago. Gregor was exhausted but had urgent business that he needed to speak with the Bishop about. Now he stood patiently awaiting the appearance of the Bishop and soon he joined the rapidly growing crowd that had gathered for the day’s sermon. The appearance of His High Holiness with his golden staff consecrated in Rome renewed Gregor’s strength and determination.
 
5. Drinker *UNLOCKED*


The old man, in his dirty rags, was sitting in the mud just outside of the tavern. Staring at the sun through the dirty glass of the bottle that he had emptied hours ago; it’s reflection causing him to squint. Lamenting, his mind wandered to better days. Half a century ago, Archie… then Archibald III was a young man of considerable wealth. Born of noble blood, an owner of a large estate, his life was one of luxury. Then he had a whole cellar filled with the finest wines and liquors to be had. Back then he didn’t believe that his life could be any better, and then fate stepped in and introduced him to the love of his life, the lovely daughter of the Viceroy to the King himself. Countless were the times that he would ride to their castle on the hill, a dashing figure on his magnificent black courser Tempest. He showered her in expensive gifts, reading reams of poetry and forever proclaiming his eternal love. Paulina, was her name; and they had spent several secretive nights in each other’s embrace. Often talking of eloping together. One beautiful spring day, Archibald came to the castle, planning on that being the night that they would run away together. But the guards did not let him enter the castle, turning him away after a scuffle. Archibald vowed to return the very next day, but by then it was too late. Paulina, the reason he drew breath, had been married to another. The months after that are still a blur to Archie… his influential father died in a war, his mother soon after of heartbreak or the plague he wasn’t sure. Most of that time Archie was drunk or getting drunk. He drowned his pain in the wine cellar of his families’ estate. One night, the estate burned down under mysterious circumstances. Soon afterwards he was stripped of his lands and family title. Penniless, loveless, and with nowhere to go Archie retreated to the one place he felt safe… the bottom of a bottle. A shadow fell over him, snapping him hazily back to reality… please don’t let it be Rufus and his gang. I copper coin landed in his lap. Above him towered the young Nobleman that lived on the hill with his widower mother. The dashing young man in a beautiful feathered beret, flashed a grin and squatted to meet his eye. “Archie! Why so glum? It’s a beautiful day, full of promise and love. Go my friend, have a beer on me.” Stumbling to his feet, Archie, bowed with gratitude. “Thank you, my Lord,” he managed to stammer. As the young man walked away, Archie smiled to himself as he flipped the coin in the air. Something in the face of that young noble reminded Archie of himself when he was a lad.
 
6. The Hermit *UNLOCKED*


Ivor, ""Old Ivor"" to some, comes into town hunched over under the weight of his burden every Sunday. His huge wicker bag is filled to the brim with berries that he collects in the woods. He sets himself up off to the side as not to be in the way of other sellers. Ivor does a fairly brisk business as he sells his berries for a pittance; Ivor is not really interested in making a profit. The reason that Ivor comes to town every week is because he wants to see his estranged daughter. Many years ago she left home, breaking off all contact with him and moved to the city. Her dream was to become a famous actress, working in the city's prestigious theater district. But life had other plans for her; she had fallen on hard times, and now Ivor watches with sadness in his eyes. Seeing his beautiful daughter, dressed as a harlot, attracting customers to a city brothel breaks his heart.
 
7. Gipsy and Boris *UNLOCKED*


Unhooking the chain the man, with the magnificent black mustache, removed the muzzle from the bear. ""Well, Boris, it was a hard day, but now it's time for rest"", as he gently stroked the bear behind the ears. Boris shook his massive frame, grateful to be free of the muzzle, and rubbed his warm nose against the man's palm.
 
 
8. Apple seller *UNLOCKED*


Marko has always loved prose, in his youth he had been a flashy poet with some promise. But sadly, these days it seemed that people no longer needed beautiful princesses and their brave knights; or at least didn’t want to pay for them. To feed his family Marko purchased a small piece of land, seeded it with apples and worked from sunup to sunset. Over the years he came to appreciate the beauty and unspoken poetry of growing apples. The feeling of the sunrise on his face, the pattern of sweat as it ran from his brow, the smell of a hot pie made with his apples, the smile of a child as they bit into one of his apples. These were all things as worthy of a ballad as any knight to Marko now. Today he is happy coming to the local market and singing the praises of his labor of love; creating beautiful rhymes about his sweet and juicy apples.
 
9. Bishop *UNLOCKED*


From the cathedral baclony, bishop could see the crowds swarming about the market square below. The remnants of his recent meal - rich and dripping with lard - still shone on his chin as he sluggishly thought: ""Seems the city is growing , an increase in the tithe may be in order"".
 

10. Courtesan *UNLOCKED*


The out of breath servant handed Angelina the letter and hurried off as not to be seen. She was right where his master had said she would be standing on the corner of the market square next to the vegetable stall. The beautiful young courtesan smiled and coyly brought the envelope to her perfect little nose. Closing her eyes, she breathed in deeply the smell of the young noble’s expensive perfume. Slowly she traced the outline of the family crest in the seal, and abruptly she tore the letter unread into several pieces and threw it into a pile of rotting vegetables that had accumulated nearby.
 
11. Herald *UNLOCKED*


Leaving the Cathedral’s heavy iron gates to close behind him, the Herald tucked the large scroll with the Bishop’s new decree under his arm and hurried on his way. Taking a shortcut though the back alleys, he quickly headed towards the town’s square. The smell of the market made him glad that had just recently cleaned his jacket. Cleaning it had not been cheap; but the special herbs that the washer used overpowered the smells of city life, and Belinda loved the scent. Stepping quickly to avoid a pool of what was possibly urine and rotting tomatoes, the Herald ascended the stairs. Taking his place and unfolding the scroll, he quickly scanned the text. Clearing his voice, the Herald spoke loud enough to be heard by all, “Here ye! Hear ye! A proclamation to all good citizens from his Most Holy Excellency. Be it known by all that there will be an increase in church tithes that will take place starting this holy day…” Looking around the courtyard at the crowd of on-lookers that had gathered for their reaction. Did that woman just pick up a rotten tomato out of that urine pool? Letting out a sigh, he resigned himself to wash his beautiful jacket yet again.
 
12. Carpet merchant  *UNLOCKED*


The market was abuzz with all manner of sights, sounds and smells. It was a busy day and business should be brisk. Nabir, however did not share in the excitement that surrounded him. For the tenth time in as many minutes he cursed under his breath, “It is already the fifth hour since I’ve opened and have not sold a single carpet. Curse my luck, and curse these people.” Looking around at the other stalls doing a vigorous business Nabir whispered, “I should have listened to my beloved Elaheh… next time I bring a caravan of dry figs and curcuma.”
 
13. Peasant girl  *UNLOCKED*


The young girl, in the simply cut but neatly maintained dress, danced in and out of the swirling mass of humanity that is the marketplace. Deftly jumping a puddle, ducking under a low stall beam, a swirl of the skirt and she was around an upended cart. Where ever she went smiles and greetings followed her, all of which she returned in kind. People were always glad to see Agnes, and not because she worked for the old noble widow on the hill, but because she was a gentle soul. Arriving at her destination, the vegetable merchant smiled broadly as she approached. After greeting the merchant, Agnes began her inspection of the pumpkins and cabbages. After choosing the best available, she waited while the merchant worked his abacus. “Eight pence” the merchant said. Agnes frowned slightly, “Not five days ago this would have only been four pence,” narrowing her eyes she continued, “this seems a little greedy to me Peter.” The merchant looked at the ground, and nudged some dirt with his boot, “I’m sorry Agnes, but I cannot sell my vegetables at my old prices anymore. Last week the Bishop almost doubled the church tithe. I cannot survive and feed my own family at that loss.” Agnes sighed, some of the light leaving her face. Resigned, she put the cabbage back on the stall, shook her head and thought, “My lady will surely curse me again.”

Road Map
An optimistic view of the ""Tiny Market Square"" campaign future below.
November-December 2018: prototyping
January 2019: making initial molds, begin casting
February 2019: Casting, casting, casting
March 2019: Casting continues and shipping starts
April 2019: no casting anymore! Shipping the last part of orders.
 
Risks and challenges
Risks to this project are minimal. We do mold making and casting every day. And have been doing so for almost 3 years as a small workshop. 3d printing of prototypes is made by us too.
We cast miniatures in resin. And it is an intensive manual labor without any automatization. Casting 10 units or casting 1000 units, its the same amount of time and work to produce each piece. If the project is particularly successful, then this may overstretch our current capacity. If so, we will expand production with new staff and equipment. 
This kind of miniature manufacturing is what we have been doing for years. There is nothing out of the ordinary workflow. Everything will be produced to our usual high standard.

<p>Skyline Chess is a company founded by two London based architects, Chris and Ian. We take iconic architecture from around the world and reimagine it as pieces on a chessboard, allowing you to play with your favourite cities and pit them against each other.</p>

<p>Kiruv vs. Orthodoxy is here to change that. You can continue to engage in halchah, hashkafah, and machshava of Judaism, The Best Religion in The Fucking World TM, even whilst socializing with your friends (of the same gender, obviously). </p>
</div><div>
<h3>A History of the Jewish People</h3>
<p>This idea started as a personal project, and after just a few short nights of going to sleep way too late, had blossomed into 180 cards of highly offensive Cards against Humanity-style of cards. (This game is not in any way affiliated with that brand)</p>
<p>The Hashgacha of the number 18 couldn't be overlooked, and I initially uploaded it to my own humble site, and shared them to Reddit. There, people asked to buy them and I was like, why, taka, fucking not? </p>
<p>So here we are. Collecting a few good men (women, you don't exist) to join together and get these cards printed in a way that's worth my while. If we can raise $500 or more I'll take the time to print these cards and get us all playing this shit. You know you want to. </p>
<h3>So, What Does This Thing Look Like</h3>
<p>Like I'd show you before you paid? But here are a few choice examples.</p>
<p><strong>Sfardi Cards:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The meaning of life is simple. It's ____ .</li>
<li>Mrs. Epstein, I'm afraid we caught your son ____ .</li>
<li>Raboysay, it's time we stopped ____ .</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ashkenazi Cards:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The gimatriyah of your name, minus one</li>
<li>Taking the bone out of the fish and not, chas v'shalom, the other way around</li>
<li>Drowning in a lake because you went swimming during sfira like a total dumbass</li>

<h3>Why I'm Doing This</h3>

<p>And it was cathartic for me to create these cards, and then masturbationally refresh my own site endlessly to see the random combinations it generated, and I hope it might be cathartic/healing/entertaining for you too. </p>
<p>Something about taking these concepts that are touted ad-nausem and used to abuse and manipulate our emotional world, and seeing just how interchangeable they are, and how they are applied in every fucking (yes, I like this word a lot. I only recently learned how to use it. Am I doing it wrong?) opportunity, helped put things in perspective.</p>
<h3>The Halachic Details</h3>
<p>The game is played as follows, in the style of Apples to Apples or Cards against Humanity. </p>
<ol>
<li>Each player receives 7 (the holiest of numbers) Ashkenazi (white) cards</li>
<li>The Sfardi (black) cards are put face down in the middle</li>
<li>The person who said asher yatzar last becomes the Card Nazi and turns over a Sfardi card</li>
<li>Everyone picks an Ashkenazi card from their hand that they feel best matches the Sfardi card in question</li>
<li>Is there a right answer? No! Elu v'elu divrei elokim chayim! The Card Nazi must Pasken which card they like the most, based off their own svara and understanding of the sugya</li>
<li>Whoever submitted the card they pick is the winner of that round, and gets to keep that Sfardi card.</li>
<li>Play continues with the player to the right (a very holy direction) beocming the next Card Nazi and turning over another Sfardi card</li>
<li>The game ends when everyone is completely sick of playing or it's time for kriyas shma of shachris, whichever comes first, and the person with the most Sfardi cards wins (this is just one example of how this game is different than real life)</li>
</ol>
<h3>What's in The Box?</h3>
<p>First off, who said there will be a box?</p>
<p>There's gonna hopefully be 180 cards. If you pledge over $5, you'll get a digital version of them right away. Over $18 (plus shipping), and I'll print a set and send them to you. </p>
<p>I can't guarantee that they will be exactly like Cards against Humanity, but they'll definitely be usable, tangible products that you can hold in your hands (which is better than a lot of the other ideas you've been sold on in the past).</p>
<p>One interesting option is to actually combine these cards with a regular CaH deck and see what happens when you combine Mashiach and Auschwitz (my favorite card, and obviously yours as well).</p>
<p>So yeah, manage your expectations, but don't curb your enthusiasm. This is gonna be great. If you weren't already, this game will send you to hell faster than you can say ""pass the cholent"".</p>
<h3>Haskamos and Brachos</h3>
<p>This project has haskamos from the greatest minds of the generation, who came together from arguing about absolutely everything to agree that ""this was the best fucking game they had ever seen, and whoever backs it will be zoche to a ton of yeshuos and his family definitely WILL NOT get ANY corona.""</p>

One thing that will make you smile though is my idea for this project – <strong>CASUALTY DICE!</strong> This in a nutshell is quite a simple concept, if you are rolling for injury then, whatever the outcome, it’s fun because you get to potentially ruin someone’s day (if you are into that sort of thing) or at the very least remove players from the game.</p><p>The project comprises of two dice, one 6-sided laser engraved 16mm Opaque White Die and the other an 8-sided Translucent Red Die. You will in all likelihood be familiar with this mechanic for your favourite Fantasy Football Game. My dice design for this project shows clearly<strong> </strong>what the result is. No fumbling about getting the two numbers mixed up etc. In an instant you see what’s happened because the sides of the dice are specifically designed this way, and should you require more information detailing the seriousness of the injury, you will be able to reference the handy high quality reference card included with each set of dice backed.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><u>Casualty Dice Sets</u></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505663415/kueym5enrvkpskpmtq34.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505663432/k7gmitcgb5cwwkcskqec.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505663448/jsvijx1rcijbqnplzkum.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505663462/uwlytb0yaltnnffjk5mg.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>How to Order Advanced D8's with League Deals</strong></p><p>To do this you need to use the ‘<strong>BACK IT</strong>’ button that sits above the Perks and below the Campaign Progress Bar on the campaign webpage. When you click ‘Back It’ it will ask for a ‘Donation Amount’. Here you need to add a figure that covers your requirement. So for example, if you require two Advanced D8’s, you would enter £7 x the number of D8’s you require, in this case, 2. Perhaps five backers would like to upgrade out of ten of your Medium League Deal, that would be £7 x 5 = £35 Donation.</p><p>Once you’ve made that Donation take a look at your <strong>ORIGINAL LEAGUE DEAL ORDER DETAILS</strong>. Take a note of your ‘<strong>Order ID</strong>’ (a two or three digit number). Once you have that number you can then use the Contact Button to send me a message. Here you will be able tell me your order number, how many Advanced D8’s you require and the colours required. It’s <strong>VERY</strong> important that those details are given to me so I can complete your order and ship to you on time at no extra cost to you.</p><p>If you have any problems during the process of upgrading please do not hesitate to contact me via this website, Facebook, Twitter or Email on charlievictorproducts@gmail.com - I’m here to help.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><u>The Six Sides Of The Casualty Dice</u></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503578188/fwp3n8zu2lldzkwyehz7.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><u>The Eight Sides Of The Advanced D8</u></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><u><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505663693/hvik1wzh79k0n1iyr0vg.jpg"" src=""""/></u></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><u><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505663706/qjn7m29mf1o0vqivosrw.jpg"" src=""""/></u></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505764202/qflz8cez7pbwztn3hxvf.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><u>Double Sided Reference Card</u></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504891222/fbp2lmryknlgeasgdwhv.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p>The dice icons are designed specifically with a medical theme in mind, with the exclusive use of the red and white colours.

I love to roll these dice and actively look forward to getting to use them against my opponent, and I'm sure you will too!

One thing that will make you smile though is my idea for this project – CASUALTY DICE! This in a nutshell is quite a simple concept, if you are rolling for injury then, whatever the outcome, it’s fun because you get to potentially ruin someone’s day (if you are into that sort of thing) or at the very least remove players from the game.The project comprises of two dice, one 6-sided laser engraved 16mm Opaque White Die and the other an 8-sided Translucent Red Die. You will in all likelihood be familiar with this mechanic for your favourite Fantasy Football Game. My dice design for this project shows clearly what the result is. No fumbling about getting the two numbers mixed up etc. In an instant you see what’s happened because the sides of the dice are specifically designed this way, and should you require more information detailing the seriousness of the injury, you will be able to reference the handy high quality reference card included with each set of dice backed.Casualty Dice SetsHow to Order Advanced D8's with League DealsTo do this you need to use the ‘BACK IT’ button that sits above the Perks and below the Campaign Progress Bar on the campaign webpage. When you click ‘Back It’ it will ask for a ‘Donation Amount’. Here you need to add a figure that covers your requirement. So for example, if you require two Advanced D8’s, you would enter £7 x the number of D8’s you require, in this case, 2. Perhaps five backers would like to upgrade out of ten of your Medium League Deal, that would be £7 x 5 = £35 Donation.Once you’ve made that Donation take a look at your ORIGINAL LEAGUE DEAL ORDER DETAILS. Take a note of your ‘Order ID’ (a two or three digit number). Once you have that number you can then use the Contact Button to send me a message. Here you will be able tell me your order number, how many Advanced D8’s you require and the colours required. It’s VERY important that those details are given to me so I can complete your order and ship to you on time at no extra cost to you.If you have any problems during the process of upgrading please do not hesitate to contact me via this website, Facebook, Twitter or Email on charlievictorproducts@gmail.com - I’m here to help.The Six Sides Of The Casualty DiceThe Eight Sides Of The Advanced D8Double Sided Reference Card The dice icons are designed specifically with a medical theme in mind, with the exclusive use of the red and white colours. I've always felt that Dice should communicate to you and your opponent the result with immediacy, and a good, simple and clean design does just that and that's what I have produced for this project.I will end this project introduction by simply saying that using a set of dice for one specific purpose is great fun. I love to roll these dice and actively look forward to getting to use them against my opponent, and I'm sure you will too! These dice have my love of Fantasy Football, my creativity and my energy poured into them, and I hope you can be part of the journey to bring them to the community for all to enjoy.Stretch GoalsIt's my pleasure to introduce the Stretch Goals to you all.

<h2><strong>About Our Idea</strong></h2>
<p>The idea came to my partner and I when we were looking for a subscription date box that fit our interests. We were particularly looking for a 'date box', or a box that had items for a pre-planned date. However, none of the boxes were themed for couples who like to play games together. Additionally, there are very few subscription boxes that ship within Europe, whereas in America and the UK, business is booming. We wanted to change this. Our idea developed into the 'Board Date' box. A subscription box available in the UK and Europe for couples keen to playing board games.</p>
<p>We are doing this campaign to get the first month of the project started with a select but dedicated group of customers. It’s important for us to get to know our customers, and a platform like IndieGOGO gives us that opportunity.</p>
<p>Our first contributors will help us streamline the process and ensure our product is of the highest quality. Additionally, the contributors will be able to help us further develop the box to fit the needs of our target group through feedback.</p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>The first 50 donations of  €50 or more will receive the exclusive first month’s box. The boxes will be shipped in mid October.</p>
<p>Each box includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>1x - 2(+) player board game/card game</li>
<li>Pre-made snacks to share</li>
<li>Photo props for silly picture perfect memories</li>
<li>*Themed Couple's Surprise*</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the initial 50 donations have been made and the first 50 boxes claimed, any additional donations of €20 or more will add you to the waitlist for the next month’s box (November) with a 20% discount.</p>
<p>The money goes to funding our first month worth of boxes, supply line establishment, and the purchasing of other distribution related item/services. With these payments done we are able to sustain our business model by incoming revenue in the future.</p>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>We wanted to make a subscription box for couples like us and many of our friends. Couples who like to play boardgames, but are too lazy to, or not able to, go to a Board Game Shop. Couples who are missing out on date night because of lack of time, ideas, or motivation to actually go somewhere. With this box we want to provide all that in one package delivered at YOUR doorstep.</p>
<h2><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>The biggest obstacle with successfully maintaining our idea can be summed up in one word: SHIPPING. Since we include items (the board game) that are a bit on the heavier end and combine them with some more items, our boxes tend to weigh more than other subscription boxes. Due to this, our biggest challenge will be finding a balance between the cost of shipping for the customer and the cost of shipping for us. We do not want to put the entire cost of shipping on the customer, nor could we maintain selling boxes should we solely cover the costs.</p>
<p>Therefore our plan is: The first month of boxes will be majorly covered by us, with only a €4.01 cost to the customer. Hopefully, after the first month of boxes are ordered and shipped, we will have a better understanding of how to fairly price the box including shipping.</p>
<p>The final issue regarding shipping is whether or not to include shipping in the price or add it as a separate charge. If you have a preference of how we should add the price of shipping let us know at info@boarddatebox.com</p>
<h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h2>
<p>You can still help us if you are unable donate. Share our IndieGOGO page with your friends and family, or whoever might be interested. We thank you from the bottom of our heart for any help you can give us.</p>
<p>We look forward to talking with you in the #BoardDate Community on Facebook, Instagram &amp; Twitter! @BoardDateBox</p>

The money goes to funding our first month worth of boxes, supply line establishment, and the purchasing of other distribution related item/services. With these payments done we are able to sustain our business model by incoming revenue in the future.
The Impact
We wanted to make a subscription box for couples like us and many of our friends. Couples who like to play boardgames, but are too lazy to, or not able to, go to a Board Game Shop. Couples who are missing out on date night because of lack of time, ideas, or motivation to actually go somewhere. With this box we want to provide all that in one package delivered at YOUR doorstep.
Risks & Challenges
The biggest obstacle with successfully maintaining our idea can be summed up in one word: SHIPPING. Since we include items (the board game) that are a bit on the heavier end and combine them with some more items, our boxes tend to weigh more than other subscription boxes. Due to this, our biggest challenge will be finding a balance between the cost of shipping for the customer and the cost of shipping for us. We do not want to put the entire cost of shipping on the customer, nor could we maintain selling boxes should we solely cover the costs.
Therefore our plan is: The first month of boxes will be majorly covered by us, with only a €4.01 cost to the customer. Hopefully, after the first month of boxes are ordered and shipped, we will have a better understanding of how to fairly price the box including shipping.
The final issue regarding shipping is whether or not to include shipping in the price or add it as a separate charge. If you have a preference of how we should add the price of shipping let us know at info@boarddatebox.com

<p>Each set of Cubble Dice will contain a pair of dice in anodized aluminum. You chose your colors, and I will do the rest.</p>
<h1>Also Comes In Tungsten?</h1>
<p><b>YES!</b> And here are a few reasons why this is one of the <b>strongest</b> dice you'll ever own:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>70%</b> denser than lead </li>
<li>
<b>Denser</b> than Uranium </li>
<li>Nearly <b>impossible</b> to melt </li>
<li>
<b>4x harder </b>than Titanium </li>
<li>
<b>19x denser</b> than water </li>
</ul>
<p>Tungsten as a metal,<b> has the highest melting point </b>of any element. Did you know that? Actually, you can't easily build a container to melt it. You have to use expensive powder compression techniques to shape it. </p>
<p>Needless to say CNC machining is a real challenge and a lot of skill and patience is needed for each piece. </p>
<p>Tungsten is also an <b>extremely rare element </b>(only 100 parts per billion in the earth's crust!!!), that's one of the main reasons behind the high cost. </p>
<p>But it is totally worth the pain, because it really is a <b>beautiful thing</b>, wouldn't you agree?</p>

<h1>DESIGN</h1>
<p>Cubble dice takes the old boring regular dice, and converts each number into simple shapes. As you can see on the design, each number from 1-6 has a different setting, based on the corresponding number. The cool part is these numbers are all connected via custom CNC engraving. Where the pip line of one number, continues on a adjacent face of the dice to create a nice look and feel.</p>

<h1>THE MATH BEHIND IT ALL</h1>

<p>When I decided to create this particular metal dice, I wanted to minimize the rotational Moment of Inertia in order to develop a dice that would roll to stop at statistically even probabilities for each of the six possible outcomes.</p>
<p>I’ve accomplished this, by making sure I’ve subtracted the same amount of material from each face of the cube. This is the result:</p>

<p>Now I’m obviously satisfied with this design, otherwise I wouldn’t have brought it to your attention. BUT, I also want to bring this product into mass production, and here is where you can make a difference.</p>

<p>All the funding I get from this project, will go into initial order, packaging, shipping &amp; handling, and other related costs.</p>
<p>These things come at a steep price, since this is a custom, unique design you won’t find anywhere else in the world. At least for now.</p>
<p>All materials are CNC machined. </p>
<p>The colored dice are 100% Aluminum, not zinc alloy. That's why is pretty expensive, since the process takes time, and can only be completed in 3 phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. The initial outside shape of the dice</li>
<li>2. Anodization</li>
<li>3. CNC machinning </li>
</ul>
<p>The basic set package is $14 (even so you're still getting it cheaper than the estimated sale price of $17)</p>
<p>As an add-on, we have special price for multiple sets you order (check right hand side for specials) in case you want to share this special dice with your loved ones. </p>
<p><i>Cubble Dice will make a perfect gift for your friends or family.</i></p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452634423/tb6d2omecgs72wagfret.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></figure><h1>ADD-ONS</h1>
<p>For any of the basic packs of Colored Aluminum Dice, be it 2, 4, 6, 8 or 10 CUBBLE dice, you can add dice made of different metals according to what you like.</p>
<p>So for example if you order a ""<i>FOUR (4) Cubble Dice - Get 4 CUBBLES in any colors you like""</i>for $25, and you also want a <b>CUBBLE made of Brass</b>, you just add to your pledge another $17. </p>
<p>So your final pledge would be $25 + $17 = $42</p>
<p>If you want to add one <b>CUBBLE in Stainless Steel</b> it would go like this:</p>
<p>$25 + $25 = $50</p>
<p>If you want one <b>CUBBLE in Tungsten</b> it would go like this:</p>
<p>$25 + $55 = $80</p>
<p>Of course, you can also add pairs of the above different metal dice to your <b>Aluminum Colored Dice.</b> You can consult the prices on the diagram above, where each extra is described to let you know how much to add to your main pledge. </p>
<p>That's the plan <b>IF</b> the funding goes well and Cubble Dice is generously funded. This is the extra you gain, because production cost will go down considerably and stretch goal rewards will be unlocked for all backers with more finishing choices AND FREE SHIPPING worldwide will be achievable.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>I’m confident this dice is nothing short of amazing. I have tested, calculated and contacted the best manufacturer I could, to be able to provide quality in due time. The only challenges I have at the moment is producing and distributing it.</p>
<p>Of course, there are possible challenges to this KickStarter project, but I’m confident I can deliver a great experience to each and every one of you that get this dice.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to review this Project, that means a lot!</p>
<p>Now go roll that awesome dice! </p>

A lot of effort, time and thought went into the design, and the math of the dice.Traditional dice was used as a base, and I worked on that. I have taken simple architectural concepts and techniques to implement modern elements into this retro-clean dice. This simple idea, resides in a complex concept, beautifully integrated into this new design.This dice feels so natural in your hand that you don't want to throw it. They are different from everything else I've ever tried, the special design gives it that certain extra excitement you can't feel in regular D6 die.Having a dice, that looks a lot like a decoration for your desk, is definitely a big advantage.


Each set of Cubble Dice will contain a pair of dice in anodized aluminum. You chose your colors, and I will do the rest.
Also Comes In Tungsten?
YES! And here are a few reasons why this is one of the strongest dice you'll ever own:


70% denser than lead 

Denser than Uranium 
Nearly impossible to melt 

4x harder than Titanium 

19x denser than water 

Tungsten as a metal, has the highest melting point of any element. Did you know that? Actually, you can't easily build a container to melt it. You have to use expensive powder compression techniques to shape it. 
Needless to say CNC machining is a real challenge and a lot of skill and patience is needed for each piece. 
Tungsten is also an extremely rare element (only 100 parts per billion in the earth's crust!!!), that's one of the main reasons behind the high cost. 
But it is totally worth the pain, because it really is a beautiful thing, wouldn't you agree?


DESIGN
Cubble dice takes the old boring regular dice, and converts each number into simple shapes. As you can see on the design, each number from 1-6 has a different setting, based on the corresponding number. The cool part is these numbers are all connected via custom CNC engraving. Where the pip line of one number, continues on a adjacent face of the dice to create a nice look and feel.







THE MATH BEHIND IT ALL
I had to take into account the Centroid of the geometric shape. Which is the center of an object. That means I had to keep the Center of Mass (or Center of Gravity) as close as possible to the one of the original pip dice.
When I decided to create this particular metal dice, I wanted to minimize the rotational Moment of Inertia in order to develop a dice that would roll to stop at statistically even probabilities for each of the six possible outcomes.
I’ve accomplished this, by making sure I’ve subtracted the same amount of material from each face of the cube. This is the result:


Obviously there is room for error since the die is CNC machined and obviously the material used is not exactly homogenome in density, but this is as close as it gets to a perfectly balanced dice.
MY CHALLENGE, YOUR GAIN
Now I’m obviously satisfied with this design, otherwise I wouldn’t have brought it to your attention. BUT, I also want to bring this product into mass production, and here is where you can make a difference.

Different Stretch Goals Colors
All the funding I get from this project, will go into initial order, packaging, shipping & handling, and other related costs.
These things come at a steep price, since this is a custom, unique design you won’t find anywhere else in the world. At least for now.
All materials are CNC machined. 
The colored dice are 100% Aluminum, not zinc alloy. That's why is pretty expensive, since the process takes time, and can only be completed in 3 phases:

1. The initial outside shape of the dice
2. Anodization
3. CNC machinning 

The basic set package is $14 (even so you're still getting it cheaper than the estimated sale price of $17)
As an add-on, we have special price for multiple sets you order (check right hand side for specials) in case you want to share this special dice with your loved ones. 
Cubble Dice will make a perfect gift for your friends or family.

ADD-ONS
For any of the basic packs of Colored Aluminum Dice, be it 2, 4, 6, 8 or 10 CUBBLE dice, you can add dice made of different metals according to what you like.
So for example if you order a ""FOUR (4) Cubble Dice - Get 4 CUBBLES in any colors you like""for $25, and you also want a CUBBLE made of Brass, you just add to your pledge another $17. 
So your final pledge would be $25 + $17 = $42
If you want to add one CUBBLE in Stainless Steel it would go like this:
$25 + $25 = $50
If you want one CUBBLE in Tungsten it would go like this:
$25 + $55 = $80
Of course, you can also add pairs of the above different metal dice to your Aluminum Colored Dice. You can consult the prices on the diagram above, where each extra is described to let you know how much to add to your main pledge. 
That's the plan IF the funding goes well and Cubble Dice is generously funded. This is the extra you gain, because production cost will go down considerably and stretch goal rewards will be unlocked for all backers with more finishing choices AND FREE SHIPPING worldwide will be achievable.

Fresh Unlocked Color - Cubble in Light Blue


 CUBBLE Dice in Different Metals


By backing this project you not only help me bring an amazing project to life, but you also help start new ones. But if you can’t afford to back at this time, you can still help by sharing my project via social media, email and word of mouth to let your friends about this brand new dice.


Thanks in advance!
P.S. here's a little preview of the dice rolling

Cubble Rolling


Risks and challenges
I’m confident this dice is nothing short of amazing. I have tested, calculated and contacted the best manufacturer I could, to be able to provide quality in due time. The only challenges I have at the moment is producing and distributing it.
Of course, there are possible challenges to this KickStarter project, but I’m confident I can deliver a great experience to each and every one of you that get this dice.
Thanks for taking the time to review this Project, that means a lot!
Now go roll that awesome dice!

This introductory-level adventure is written for a free-form, old school type of play, as the characters go ""hex crawling"" through the wilderness to discover the secret of a strange map that has fallen into their hands.This classic adventure was originally published in 2010, and contains the original introduction about how to approach ""old-school"" type play with Dungeons & Dragons and similar RPGs. The edition is re-done and is printed in premium quality for three rules-systems: D&D 5e, Pathfinder 1e, and Swords & Wizardry. The Project Frog God Games projects on Indiegogo are simple, focused, and short.
Short in duration (2-3 weeks)
Fast delivery of PDF once funding is completed
Limited to a single title
Have options priced between $5-$30
Stretch goals and project bonuses (if any) affect the principle reward only (usually both the PDF and the softcover).
Are the only guaranteed method to get the premium* print copy (NOTE: the softcover versions  in this printing will not be sold on our website: see FAQ for explanation).
Have a simple fulfillment process that does not use Backerkit
*Premium means heavyweight glossy interior pages enhancing the art and color elements. The  thick, glossy cardstock brings out the vibrant color of the cover illustration. These are the nicest softcover books we have ever sold and we only print a title this way once.Any reprint would use print on demand service that, although nice, do not approach the quality of our INDIEGOGO funded books.Why the Tiny Print Run?Since 2012 our crowdfunding approach has been extravagant in every way. Ambitious with massive page counts, plus numerous add-on options and stretch goals. All supporting a primary title itself as many as 990 pages.This has resulted in Kickstarter's with memorable pledge rewards that include top-quality hardcover books with sometimes dozens of stretch goal bonuses and add-on extras. These are awesome AND they are expensive to buy for customers like you because they are very expensive to make for publishers like us.Why not use Kickstarter?We will still be using Kickstarter, frequently, for our large-scale projects, but we hear the request for less expensive options for our products all the time, especially smaller, faster-paced adventures that can be completed in 2-3 sessions.Product enhancements tied to project success During the funding period for 1975 and after the funding goal is met we will  improve the delivered product based on additional sales.

<p>On February 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2019, my youngest daughter, Harper, was diagnosed with leukemia. The next few days were hard. Two days after diagnosis, while sitting in bed, Kelly from Child Services came in with a gift card from Friends of Kids with Cancer. Harper immediately perked up, and within 15 minutes she’d sent me out of the hospital to spend that money!! Friends of Kids with Cancer gave us our First Good Day. Harp is in remission and we want to give back some of what they’ve given us.</p>
<p>Harper is a gamer; she’s in Tales of the Margreve (Kobold Press) with her sister, Ghoul Island (Petersen Games), and she plays D&amp;D and loves to write stories. It only makes sense that we write a D&amp;D adventure book together and to use it as a platform to raise funds Friends of Kids. This project began as a conversation in the hospital, turned into an outline after she was discharged, and is now an amazing book that we’re all so proud of.</p>
<p>Joining Harper and I are an elite team of creators including: Jeff Stevens, Ben McFarland, Brian Suskind, Hannah Rose, Ashley Warren, Kienna Shaw, Bill Barnett,  MT Black, Donathin Frye, Anna Landin, Gwendy B, Anna Meyer, Dyson Logos, Jessica Ross, and others! Kobold Press and Petersen Games also pitched in to us bring this to life.</p>
<h2><strong>What is Harper's Tale?</strong></h2>
<p>Harper’s Tale is a forest-based adventure path of 10 connected adventures culminating in the party, now 10th level, confronting the source of the plague within their home land. The adventure is intended for players as young as 10, but I promise players of all ages will find plenty to keep them engaged with the story.</p>
<p>The adventure path starts in the Village of Grove as the heroes come to a seemingly deserted village. Through exploration and investigation, they learn that a mysterious illness has taken over the town, leaving only two young women, Rose and Grace, to care for the populace.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564607083/w28enya4yr0kbbsoszzj.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Their investigations take them under the town, and, in learning the source of the illness, they find themselves drawn into a much bigger plot by a mysterious force they know little about. What is clear is that the forest they call home is in danger, and the entity behind the illness of Grove has only just begun its foul machinations as evidenced by a sudden outbreak of madness in a neighboring town.</p>
<p>A second outbreak is staved off by the heroes—surely they are best described as such after saving not one but two villages—and they find themselves traveling to see the arch-druid of the forest, Deng. The journey is arduous, but the clever adventurers comport themselves well, and learn much in their audience with the ancient druid, including the ingredients for fashioning a cure for the otherworldly contagion and, more importantly, the appropriate rites for harvesting the key components.</p>
<p>Harvesting the cure is a greater challenge than the adventurers anticipated as they must deal with a cold war between the hidden powers of the forest in addition to gathering the ingredients in the dark recesses of the primordial wood.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564607051/at5resejmo9hi9hodg9g.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The adventure culminates in a confrontation with the creature whose machinations have been behind the debilitating disease wracking the forest. The heroes have learned much of their enemy, but have they learned all there is to know? How will they react when confronted with the source of so much pain and sorrow? Can it be defeated? Redeemed? Or will it win the day? There’s only one way to find out.</p>
<h2>Meet the Team.</h2>
<p>Harper’s Tale is much more than a story about hope and adventure. It’s more than an opportunity to help kids just be kids. It’s also about inclusivity and hearing the voices of those who aren’t heard often enough. To bring those perspectives we have a team of old pros – Brian Suskind and Ben McFarland have literally dozens of titles, multiple ENnie awards, and have worked with publishers such as <strong>Kobold Press, Rite Publishing, Paizo, Wizards of the Coast, Atlas Games</strong>, and <strong>Storm Bunny Studios</strong>; there’s also MT Black, a guild adept with more titles than I can list whose work appears in official <strong>Wizards of the Coast</strong> products.</p>
<p>Joining these seasoned writers are some new(ish) faces. Myself (author/lead developer for <strong>Kobold Press, Petersen Games, Infinity Black, Chaosium, </strong>and owner of <strong>Saturday Morning Scenarios</strong>), Donathin Frye (<strong>Encounter Roleplay, Saturday Morning Scenarios, Petersen Games, Mage Hand Press, </strong>and <strong>Modiphius</strong>), and Jeff Stevens (<strong>DMsGuild</strong> bestseller &amp; creator of <strong>Savage Encounters</strong> series).</p>
<p>But most exciting of all are the folks that are going to carry us all forward for years to come. Ashley Warren (the amazing <strong>Uncaged Anthologies</strong> and <strong>DnD Beyond</strong> among other things), Kienna Shaw (<strong>Salty Sweet Games</strong>), and Bill Barnett (<strong>Infinite Black</strong>), and Hannah Rose (<strong>Wizards of the Coast, DMsGuild,</strong> and <strong>Kobold Press</strong>). Rounding out our team are Gwendy Bee and Anna Landin whose amazing art is on display on this page, and our editors (Jess, and Craig Judd) and Layout (Craig again).</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Harper’s Tale is not my first crowdfunding campaign, and the biggest challenges for most crowdfunding campaigns is completing the project and getting it to the backers in a timely manner.

A significant portion of the work has been completed, and all printing and shipping of physical product will be handled via DriveThruRPG. This is a very low-risk campaign for you to back.</p>

<p>Fuck You - The Game began actually out of frustration with a shared job between me and my roommate.  The business we worked for basically cheated the workers every chance they could.  They didn't offer fair pay, or customer service when necessary.  Their attitude towards their employees was a big Fuck You.  </p>
<p>I had started creating card games with another roommate, so while sitting around at work, discussing how our job didn't care about us, my roommate Tony joked about having a card game about getting screwed over.  I can't remember the title he suggested, but the object of the game was to spell out this long, inappropriate crude phrase.  Though he was just joking around, I said, ""No, you're joking, but this can be a really great game.  But we got to spell out something simpler.""  From there we tossed around other ideas.  Some too long still...others too short.  Eventually settled on ""Fuck You""....it was perfect!</p>
<p>We created rules, cut out slips of paper and played a trial game.  Then, tweaked he rules where needed until we came up with what I believe is the funnest card game I've ever played.  </p>
<p>It was really important to me to find a game that playable and fun with 4 players or just 2.  Most card games are not fun with only two players.  However, I had recently purchased Exploding Kittens for me and a friend to play at a get together.  It was AWESOME!  I think it's even more fun if it's only two players.  So, I wanted to create something that lived up to those standards.  And, surprisingly, I succeeded.  </p>
<p>So, you now know the story.....wanna find out about the game?  Well, who cares, Fuck You!  </p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Fuck You - The Game began actually out of frustration with a shared job between me and my roommate.  The business we worked for basically cheated the workers every chance they could.  They didn't offer fair pay, or customer service when necessary.  Their attitude towards their employees was a big Fuck You.  
I had started creating card games with another roommate, so while sitting around at work, discussing how our job didn't care about us, my roommate Tony joked about having a card game about getting screwed over.  I can't remember the title he suggested, but the object of the game was to spell out this long, inappropriate crude phrase.  Though he was just joking around, I said, ""No, you're joking, but this can be a really great game.  But we got to spell out something simpler.""  From there we tossed around other ideas.  Some too long still...others too short.  Eventually settled on ""Fuck You""....it was perfect!
We created rules, cut out slips of paper and played a trial game.  Then, tweaked he rules where needed until we came up with what I believe is the funnest card game I've ever played.  
It was really important to me to find a game that playable and fun with 4 players or just 2.  Most card games are not fun with only two players.  However, I had recently purchased Exploding Kittens for me and a friend to play at a get together.  It was AWESOME!  I think it's even more fun if it's only two players.  So, I wanted to create something that lived up to those standards.  And, surprisingly, I succeeded.  
So, you now know the story.....wanna find out about the game?  Well, who cares, Fuck You!  
Just kidding.  LOL

</div></div>","What's going on here then?Carcosa is a board game that successfully funded on Kickstarter in July 2017, exceeding it goal by over 400% and hitting all 10 of its stretch goals.Production is now underway with the manufacturer and this campaign will allow you to pre-order Carcosa to be part of that first print run!Because the crowdfunding campaign is complete on Kickstarter by preordering directly here from Indiegogo you know exactly what you're getting. There's no funding goals, no stretch goals and none of the uncertainty that accompanies being a backer in a crowdfunding campaign but you will still get all of the additional content unlocked or added during the campaign!That means the two mini-expansions, five art cards, four unique chapter house cards, four custom prophet meeples, a box liner, solo rules and multilingual reference cards will be included with every copy sold here!Have a look below - we hope you like what you see.-- One Free ElephantYour copy of Carcosa will contain the following game components:Plus the following:These are some of the features and highlights you'll encounter while playing Carcosa that people have been getting excited about!Each time you play, you summon a different Carcosa. Each player must compete for their choice from a shifting display of tile stacks.
In this animation: The Orange Cult selects a tile.
This makes Carcosa strategic. You must decide not just what’s good for you, but also what you need to deny your opponents! Once chosen, each unstable tile must be added to Carcosa either to expand it or to replace another unstable, unguarded tile.  
In this animation: New tiles are added to Carcosa.
This makes Carcosa rewarding. Even though you are competing, you have, together with your opponents, created a unique landscape through the game.You will deploy your cultists to districts, ley lines and ritual sites to expand your domain, protect it and even invade your opponents.
In this animation: Brown is claiming ley lines, Orange is claiming a district, Purple makes sacrifices and Blue claims a ritual site.These are familiar mechanics but each has unique thematic purpose and benefits that make them strategically different from other tile laying games.Any tile with a yellow tint may have a hidden feature that is only revealed when the tile is “stabilised” (and flipped over)! This gives Carcosa players secret plans, the ability to bluff and the need to analyse their opponents moves to try and discern what secrets they know about Carcosa. 

In this animation: Blue adds a tile and a sacrifice. A feaster is revealed and devours three cultists!
Carcosa played well is a game with a rhythm - you plan, you build and then you reveal over a number of turns. This makes the building tense and the successful reveal (or your opponents thwarting of it!) exciting. Carcosa is balanced to reward long-term strategies over building small things frequently.  Your cultists go mad when they succeed and must recover before they can be reused. Mechanics are built to support the theme, giving a sense of ""person"" to your cultists and a sense of mystery to Carcosa. (What did they see?)

In this animation: Orange cultists recover their sanity.
You will build power in 3 ways in Carcosa:   
Occult Power will simply drive you towards victory.  
You will recruit more cultists as you explore the districts of Carcosa to gain more control over the landscape.  
You will empower Ritual Stones with game changing spells you can use later to sway the game in your favour.  
Choosing what to concentrate on each turn provides short-term goals that will hopefully feed your long-term schemes!There are two, mutually exclusive, ways to win in Carcosa. This means late in the game one or more players can be trying to win one way while the others try and thwart them and work towards their own victories. Uneasy alliances can form and are often betrayed – just like you would expect from a group mad cults with a common goal!Each player leads a Lovecraftian Cult. Taking turns, their Prophet selects a tile representing a part of Carcosa and adds it to a ethereal landscape of ritual sites, ley lines, towers and domes. Players can then deploy Cultists to control a ley line, conduct a ritual or explore the districts they have summoned.But Carcosa is no normal city:
Tiles must be stabilised with power drawn from ley lines or they may be reshaped by other cults! 
New cultists may be recruited by performing the Forbidden Play at theatres you reveal! 
Your cultist will be driven mad by the power they desire or sacrificed to the horrific Feaster from Beyond for even greater power! 
Ritual stones will let you cast game-changing spells! 
The game ends when a Cult completes the Summoning of the King Himself or when enough of Carcosa has been summoned that it becomes a permanent feature of our Earth. Only one Cult can succeed in one of these insane tasks - but in Lovecraft’s mythos, can one truly call that winning?If you want to learn more about how Carcosa plays, you can read the main rule book or the solo rule book by following these links:  Alternatively, and for the first time for us, you can try the virtual version if you have a copy of Tabletop Simulator!

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Any ""Pick-Up"" option ?</strong><br/>• Yes ! For people living in Montreal, once we receive the games at our office, you be able to pass by and we will refund the shipping cost. Note that a 2 months delay may apply (boat shipping takes longer)</p>
<p><strong>Is Kiwetin available in other languages ?</strong><br/>• Kiwetin will be delivered with two sets of cards and rules. French and English. German and Spanish rules will be available in PDF on our website soon.</p>
<p><strong>How many miniatures in the box ?</strong><br/>• ​There is 6 highly detailed miniatures in the box. We only showcase the 3 spirits because there will be 2 of each. Allowing games up to 6 players.</p>
<p><strong>Why no stretch goals ?</strong><br/>• ​We decided not to offer strectch goals because we believe Kiwetin is a game simple enough that already had every mandatory elements. We wanted to give the best. Right away!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The quality of the game’s production is our main concern. We work with BangWee Productions, and quality control is paramount for them. We therefore do not foresee any problems at this level. We received prototypes from them and the quality was beyond expectations.</p>
<p>We are planning to deliver all copies of the game no more than 60 days after the end of the campaign. However, we are not shielded from being a little late beyond our control.</p>
<p>Be aware that some customs fees may apply.</p>
<p>We will keep you informed of the progress made concerning the production and delivery process.<br/> </p>

This is something we'd like to continue!Our goal is to:
Create enjoyable, high quality content.
Fully teach you the game, so you can skip the rule book.
Play the game, so you can see how it works and decide if it is a good fit for you.
Create a community where you know are a valued participant.
Make it easier for more people to discover and enjoy tabletop gaming.
What We Created Last YearDonations to Watch It Played enable me to work on the series full time. Your support last year created 167 videos, where we:
Taught 44 Unique Games
Played 11 Unique Games
Conducted 9 Live Q&A Shows
Previewed 12 Games
Previewed 6 Products
Posted 19 Videos from the GTS Come & Play Event
Posted 4 Table Talk Segments
Created 17 News, Updates and Contest Videos
The Fundraiser Goals!Below you'll find our key goals to success this year (and some fun stretch goals too!). Completed goals will gain this UNLOCKED title!UNLOCKED! - GOAL: $60,000 - Tutorials & Rodney Funded! This goal gets things started by ensuring I'm personally funded and can continue creating tutorial and other related solo content all year long! You can track our progress towards this first goal below. Each $5,000 we raise covers another month that we'll mark on the calendar as FUNDED. UNLOCKED! - GOAL: $70,000 - Gen Con Mountie Cosplay! You funded the show and you're well on the way to ensuring I have a co-host. Your support deserves a display of gratitude! At Gen Con 2018 I will wear a Mountie costume for a full day of cosplay, as requested by a viewer at Origins this past year! Pictures will be taken and shared. UNLOCKED! - GOAL: $80,000 - Game Plays & Pep MacDonald Funded This is a very important goal for Season 7. Being able to record game play episodes requires a partner. It also allows us to cover more tutorials and bring you more fun. Pep MacDonald has been working on the show for the past year, but to support his ongoing contributions, I need to be able to compensate him for all he brings to the table. This stretch goal ensures I can do that. GOAL: $90,000 - We Did It! You've ensured Watch It Played maintains its fundraising from the previous season and can continue to grow in new directions. As an extra thanks I will be letting the viewers vote on a game we feature during the 7th season. Note: Games that I would not find appropriate for the show, or fall outside the boundaries of my capabilities (or are the game featured in the next perk level), will not be included in this vote.GOAL: $100,000 - The Force Is Strong! It has become an online source of jokes and prodding (spearheaded by a certain Marty Connell from Rolling Dice and Taking Names), but at this funding level, yes... for all of you going above and beyond... I will... finally... create a tutorial video for Star Wars Rebellion.UPDATE - August 4, 2017I don't even know where to begin. In response to this stretch goal, a video was secretly created and posted online by some of my most favorite people.  It's... well... just watch.Season 7 PerksUnique Promo Cards: The promos are meant to be a small token of appreciation - rather than the purpose of the donation, but I hope you'll enjoy these offerings from our publisher friends!
Delivery of these promos will be dependent on when I get copies from the publishers. I will keep you updated during the campaign and in regular fundraiser updates following it.
To ensure all backers have the best chance of getting each promo card they want, you may not request duplicate promos within the same donation.
Unless otherwise stated, each pictured promo is a single card. For example, if you want all of the Legacy promos, when making your selection, these will count as 3 separate promos.
If you're looking for a promo we offered during a previous season and don't see it listed, that is because we didn't have enough to offer at this time.
The Dead of Winter Promos are in limited supply. I may not be able to get them again, but I should have enough left over to cover anyone who donates at their perk levels. If I feel we may run out, I'll put an update on the fundraiser page well in advance to indicate it, and donations for them will be fulfilled in order of when the pledge was made.
$5 - The Backer: Every donation counts, and we thank you for yours - you help make the show possible!$15 - The Reader: At this donation level you'll receive a Newsletter after the fundraiser closes, with important information about the next season of the show.

<p>Glad you asked. <i>Ancient Worlds: Atisi</i> is an RPG setting for <i>Dungeon World</i> inspired by Egyptian Mythology and set in a faux Bronze Age world. It was successfully funded in a Brazilian crowdfunding project two years ago and is now available in English... I mean, it will be, with your help.</p>

<p>What will you find in this 280-page 6x9"" book? Let’s see…</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Major rules changes for Dungeon World</strong>, including tweaks to the basic moves, bonds, playbooks (classes), and magic. After all, a Bronze Age setting inspired by Egyptian Mythology is different from standard DW. The land you hail from shapes you, and when you deal with the corrupting power of magic you are subject to taints that will mark your mind and body.</li>
<li>
<strong>Information about the setting</strong>, including descriptions of locations and questions about them. Major points of interest, like pyramids, monuments and cities include the right amount of detail to inspire GMs without restricting the group's input in customizing the world.</li>
<li>
<strong>Monsters and creatures</strong>, including their stats, moves, instincts and descriptions. Are you ready to face the dreadful m'siseks or confront cultists blessed by dark powers?</li>
<li>
<strong>Common equipment</strong> and tools. A bronze weapon is different from one made of steel, but both are lethal: when you are on the battlefield, you don't ask your opponent what material her kopesh is made of.</li>
<li>
<strong>Five compendium classes</strong> the heroes can follow. Will you become a <i>jade acolyte</i> or will you bow your head to the lower powers and accept your fate as a <i>dark servant?</i>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Mystical artifacts and magical items</strong> the heroes can discover. Some of these aren't what they seem... Everything has a price; even when you receive a boon, sooner or later you'll discover banes attached to it. Some may change you, others may tempt you.</li>
<li>
<strong>Game Master (GM) tips</strong> and rules needed to run a game. Do you have what it takes to make this world your own?</li>
</ul>

<p>My name is Marcelo Paschoalin. I've being playing roleplaying games since 1986 and writing novels since the late '90s. I have more than a dozen published books, including dark fantasy novels and other roleplaying games. In no particular order, I'm an author, translator, father, and husband, and I also live with 7 (yes, seven!) cats.</p>

<p><i>Ancient Worlds: Atisi</i> is not only a Bronze Age setting inspired by Egyptian Mythology: it's another milestone in our journey to provide good RPG material to the world! When you back this project, you give us authors and developers tools to create even more and bring excellence to the roleplaying community all over the world.</p>
<p>Now I have two bits of news: the good and the even better.</p>
<p>The good news is the book is almost done! Yes, you read that right: all of the text has been edited and proofread, and I've even got an <i>alpha layout</i> ready for you! Are you with me? This project is ready to receive the green light from the start. The only thing that's missing (and it's a stretch goal) is art. I'm sure we'll be able to raise the needed funds to hire good artists to bring this vision into life.</p>
<p>And the even-better news? Check out the perk/reward levels. We've kept them as simple and inexpensive as possible. You can just donate money if you're feeling generous (or don't have enough for a PDF or book, but still want to see this project succeed), back for a PDF, or back for a physical book.</p>

<p>There are a few ways to help bring this project to life:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>With a little help ($1+)</strong>: When you choose this perk, you are giving us a thumbs up and, in return, you'll have your name listed in the book's credits as thanks for your support.</li>
<li>
<strong>Dyslexic-friendly PDF ($5+):</strong> After some research, I've found that dyslexics have a hard time reading most traditional RPG books. I'm offering a plain PDF book with a simple font/typeface in dark grey over a light yellow/beige background, double-spaced, with no art.

<p>To make <i>Ancient Worlds: Atisi</i> real is a simple and quick process. Basically, this works like a pre-order: you back the project and, at the end of the campaign, you'll receive what you asked for. However, the paramount difference between crowdfunding and preordering it that if we don't reach the goal, you'll have your money back and the book won't happen. You are guaranteed to receive what you pay for. This ensures transparency during the whole process.</p>
<p>Backing this project is as easy as 1-2-3:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose your perk/reward</li>
<li>Back the project</li>
<li>Share the campaign with your friends</li>
</ul>
<p>Choosing the perk/reward is the first step. Check the available perks and see which one calls to you. When in doubt, <i>Sword &amp; sorcery</i> is the most popular reward with the best value, as it includes the PDF file and a print-on-demand softcover book.</p>
<p>Backing the project is the second step. That's why we have that lateral fields to the right: just choose your perk, click on it, confirm the dollar amount and you'll be directed to the checkout screen.</p>
<p>Sharing the campaign is the final step. After all, the more people who know about <i>Ancient Worlds: Atisi</i>, the greater chance we have of reaching the goal. And if you liked the project and invested your money, you want this to be funded -- if you bring two more people to the game, we triple our efforts!</p>

<p>If we reach our main goal and the book becomes a reality, why not take this a step further and dream big? This is what I call a rational dream, as I have my feet firmly on the ground when thinking about what I can offer. If this campaign exceeds the initial plan, we'll have more goodies:</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can you tell me how the money will be spent?<br/><strong>A:</strong> The basic goal is to have physical copies made and so on. Any extra money will be invested in art -- even if we don't reach the stretch goal, I intend to purchase at the very least some stock art -- and related assets.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Do you intend to write sourcebooks or additional material?<br/><strong>A:</strong> Atisi is just one of the insular kingdoms in the setting. There are others, like Kunla, Mungo, Gotai, etc. and, depending on the success of this crowdfunding and the interest of our readers, we may see other books soon.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> I see the estimate delivery date is December/2018. Can you elaborate?<br/><strong>A:</strong> Sure. As soon as the crowdfunding campaign ends, I'll send the backers surveys to confirm the names they want on the credits page. Meanwhile, if we have reached the stretch goal that gives us art, I'll have the hired artists working.  I intend to send all backers updates on this progress every two weeks. Art done (let's say, by October)? Good. The penultimate layout will be done and I'll order softcover and hardcover PoD books to be sure everything is in order. I expect one extra re-order to fix any issues ( most likely in late November), and then I'll be able to ship everything. If anything happens to affect this schedule, I'll promptly send all backers updates as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> I like what I see here, but I don't know about <i>Dungeon World</i>. Can you help me?<br/><strong>A:</strong> <i>Dungeon World</i> is an easy tabletop RPG system: roll 2d6 and add a statistic. On a 10+ you get a full success, a 7-9 is a partial success and you'll get what you want but with a catch, and on a 6- the GM will tell you what went wrong.

In any case, if you want to review my book, send me a message and we'll talk about it.</p>
</div></div>","Glad you asked. Ancient Worlds: Atisi is an RPG setting for Dungeon World inspired by Egyptian Mythology and set in a faux Bronze Age world. It was successfully funded in a Brazilian crowdfunding project two years ago and is now available in English... I mean, it will be, with your help.


What will you find in this 280-page 6x9"" book? Let’s see…


Major rules changes for Dungeon World, including tweaks to the basic moves, bonds, playbooks (classes), and magic. After all, a Bronze Age setting inspired by Egyptian Mythology is different from standard DW. The land you hail from shapes you, and when you deal with the corrupting power of magic you are subject to taints that will mark your mind and body.

Information about the setting, including descriptions of locations and questions about them. Major points of interest, like pyramids, monuments and cities include the right amount of detail to inspire GMs without restricting the group's input in customizing the world.

Monsters and creatures, including their stats, moves, instincts and descriptions. Are you ready to face the dreadful m'siseks or confront cultists blessed by dark powers?

Common equipment and tools. A bronze weapon is different from one made of steel, but both are lethal: when you are on the battlefield, you don't ask your opponent what material her kopesh is made of.

Five compendium classes the heroes can follow. Will you become a jade acolyte or will you bow your head to the lower powers and accept your fate as a dark servant?


Mystical artifacts and magical items the heroes can discover. Some of these aren't what they seem... Everything has a price; even when you receive a boon, sooner or later you'll discover banes attached to it. Some may change you, others may tempt you.

Game Master (GM) tips and rules needed to run a game. Do you have what it takes to make this world your own?



(cover not final)

My name is Marcelo Paschoalin. I've being playing roleplaying games since 1986 and writing novels since the late '90s. I have more than a dozen published books, including dark fantasy novels and other roleplaying games. In no particular order, I'm an author, translator, father, and husband, and I also live with 7 (yes, seven!) cats.

Ancient Worlds: Atisi is not only a Bronze Age setting inspired by Egyptian Mythology: it's another milestone in our journey to provide good RPG material to the world! When you back this project, you give us authors and developers tools to create even more and bring excellence to the roleplaying community all over the world.
Now I have two bits of news: the good and the even better.
The good news is the book is almost done! Yes, you read that right: all of the text has been edited and proofread, and I've even got an alpha layout ready for you! Are you with me? This project is ready to receive the green light from the start. The only thing that's missing (and it's a stretch goal) is art. I'm sure we'll be able to raise the needed funds to hire good artists to bring this vision into life.
And the even-better news? Check out the perk/reward levels. We've kept them as simple and inexpensive as possible. You can just donate money if you're feeling generous (or don't have enough for a PDF or book, but still want to see this project succeed), back for a PDF, or back for a physical book.


Of course! Here you will find some sample pages. Be patient with us since this is just a draft, okay?


There are a few ways to help bring this project to life:


With a little help ($1+): When you choose this perk, you are giving us a thumbs up and, in return, you'll have your name listed in the book's credits as thanks for your support.

Dyslexic-friendly PDF ($5+): After some research, I've found that dyslexics have a hard time reading most traditional RPG books. I'm offering a plain PDF book with a simple font/typeface in dark grey over a light yellow/beige background, double-spaced, with no art. This can be more easily read or even listened to using text-to-speech software. You'll also have your name listed in the book's credits as thanks for your support.

A kind of magic ($14+): When you choose this perk, you'll receive something that the people of the past would surely consider magic -- a PDF file of Ancient Worlds: Atisi! Who can deny PDFs are magical when they bring worlds like this to life? You'll also have your name listed in the book's credits as thanks for your support.

Sword and sorcery ($39+): When you choose this perk, you are saying you don't want simply the ethereal version of the book -- you want the physical thing as well! You'll receive a PDF file and a print-on-demand black & white softcover copy of Ancient Worlds: Atisi. Of course, you'll have your name listed in the book's credits as thanks for your support as well.

Atisi verde e amarelo ($50+): Esta recompensa é apenas para quem está no Brasil: você receberá o livro colorido, com capa dura, ganhará também um PDF, e terá seu nome na página de agradecimentos. -- O frete para esta recompensa (US$ 10) já será incluído ao finalizar o apoio. -- E mais: você também receberá um PDF com os manuais de classe (playbooks) traduzidos para o português!

A gift to give ($52+): When you choose this perk, you'll receive two PDF files of Ancient Worlds: Atisi (so you can gift one to someone else) and a print-on-demand black & white softcover copy. Of course, you'll have your name listed in the book's credits as thanks for your support as well.

Banding together ($60+): When you choose this perk, you are responsible for bringing joy and glory to your gaming group, as you'll receive five PDF copies of Ancient Worlds: Atisi! Your name and the names of your gaming group will be listed in the book's credits as thanks for your support.

Patron of the arts ($100+): When you choose this perk, you are sponsoring a specific art piece that will be in the book, whether we achieve the stretch goals or not. Your money will be invested in hiring an artist to create a special piece and your name will be shown by the artwork (something like ""Art by Jane, sponsored by Josh""). You will also receive a PDF file and a print-on-demand black & white softcover copy of Ancient Worlds: Atisi. Of course, you'll have your name listed in the book's credits as thanks for your support as well.

Hardcover upgrade (+$13): If you are getting a print-on-demand softcover book and want to upgrade your reward in order to receive a hardcover book instead, select this perk in addition to what you have already selected. After you select the first perk/reward and make your payment, you need to do it a second time, selecting this perk.

Color upgrade (+$32): If you are getting a print-on-demand book and want to upgrade your reward to receive a color book, select this perk in addition to what you have already selected. After you select the first perk/reward and make your payment, you need to do it a second time, selecting this perk.

By the way, as soon as you back this project at any perk/reward level except With a little help, you'll have access to the complete alpha book (the working version of the PDF) in order to read everything from day 1 -- it may take up to 24 hours for me to send you the link, as this is a manual process, but you won't need to wait for the end of the campaign.

If your perk/reward includes a print-on-demand book (softcover or hardcover, black & white or color, depending on your choices), we'll assess shipping and charge you after the campaign ends.

Surely I do!

At $5,500 all backers, regardless of perk/reward level, will get a PDF file and at-cost code for purchasing a print-on-demand copy of special decks of cards from DriveThruRPG. Each Playbook Deck will include all of the basic and advanced plus all basic, advanced, and specific moves for that Playbook. The GM Deck will have GM moves and a few play aids. I anticipate each deck to cost around $6.20 plus shipping.

At $10,000 all backers, regardless of perk/reward level, will get a new playbook designed by David Guyll and Melissa Fisher in PDF.

Maybe we'll have more stretch goals, but I don't want to bite more than I can chew. I want this to be a success, and in order to do that I need to be realistic about what I can offer to you.

Art done (let's say, by October)? Good. The penultimate layout will be done and I'll order softcover and hardcover PoD books to be sure everything is in order. I expect one extra re-order to fix any issues ( most likely in late November), and then I'll be able to ship everything. If anything happens to affect this schedule, I'll promptly send all backers updates as soon as possible.
Q: I like what I see here, but I don't know about Dungeon World. Can you help me?A: Dungeon World is an easy tabletop RPG system: roll 2d6 and add a statistic. On a 10+ you get a full success, a 7-9 is a partial success and you'll get what you want but with a catch, and on a 6- the GM will tell you what went wrong. You can read more about Dungeon World here and even find the whole System Reference Document here.
Q: I want to review your book.A: You do realize this is not a question, right?Q: But you answered with a question. That's not right.A: This is not a question either. Moot point.Q: I'm serious.A: You also realize I'm old enough to use that sentence as a really bad dad joke, don't you, Serious? In any case, if you want to review my book, send me a message and we'll talk about it.",17.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Jonathan, and I am an A/C contractor by trade, and have a bachelor's degree in Journalism.  My wife, Elizabeth has her Bachelor's degree in Education.  This is a far cry from Ph.Ds in Philosophy or Theology.  </p>
<p>But last year, my wife and I began attending an apologetics class, taught by Dr. Joe Mulvihill and Pastor Chris Wheeler. </p>
<p>After hearing the compelling evidence for the Gospel of Jesus Christ, we began to ask the question, ""Why is this the first time I am hearing this?"" </p>
<p>With the direction of Dr. Mulvihill, we began reading these Apologetics books incessantly, trying to digest all of the amazing evidence for the Gospels.  </p>
<p>Then we asked, ""How can we take all of this information, and compile it into a single resource that we could learn from, which would also be a ton of fun?""</p>
<p>This birthed our board game, 'Welcome to Truth'.   </p>
<p>I believe that this game is going to change and transform an entire generation of young people to not only proclaim their faith, but also the evidence for their faith to the world around them. </p>
<p>You can see, in the video above that the game is both simple to pick up, and fun to play.  In just five minutes, you will be laughing and learning, as you move your way to the other side of the cross.  </p>
<p>The best part though is, as you pay attention to the questions being asked, you are learning some of the most compelling evidence known right now for the most important event in human history, the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, as well as evidence for the Biblical Creation, etc.  </p>
<p>Please pray about sharing this video and/or page with all of your friends and buying a copy or two for yourselves as well.  </p>
<p>This is an engaging way for your kids to learn the truth about their faith while having a great time in the process.  It's also a way for you to educate your co-workers and community with answers from Christian Ph.Ds across the globe. </p>
<p>Please partner with us as we seek to change the next generation for the Kingdom of Jesus Christ.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Putting this board game together has been one of the most enriching and educational experiences of my life.  However, finding someone to press up thousands of these games at a fair price has been a bit more challenging.</p>
<p>We are needing $50,000 to press these board games up, and get them out to you.  We have found, in our small amount of experience with working with game companies, that ordering in BULK is definitely BEST.</p>

<p><i><strong>Island of Sorrow</strong></i> is an adventure for characters levels 3-5 that takes them on a journey across the sea to rescue the lost scion of a wealthy merchant family. Tavin Lar hoped to reclaim his family's faltering fortunes by discovering the mythical Island of Sorrows. He found it, but via shipwreck. He sent for help using his last magic scroll, and the rescue mission is under way -- but can our heroes survive long enough to find the mythical island, locate Tavin Lar and bring him home?</p>
<p><strong>In Island of Sorrow you will find:</strong></p>
<p>A complete hex crawl adventure across the mythical island and its savage archipelago.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rules for ship travel, operation, and adventure.</li>
<li>New monsters ready to tackle any maritime adventure.</li>
<li>More lizardfolk and dinosaurs than you can shake a stick at.*</li>
</ul>
<p>*Do not shake sticks at lizardfolk and dinosaurs. We are not responsible for character death as a result of ill advised stick shaking. You should probably stay out of the water as well.</p>

<h3>The Project </h3>
<p><a href=""http://froggodgames.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Frog God Games</a> projects on Indiegogo are simple, focused, and short.</p>
<ul>
<li>Short in duration (2-3 weeks)</li>
<li>Fast delivery of PDF once funding is completed</li>
<li>Limited to a single title</li>
<li>Have options priced between $5-$30</li>
<li>Stretch goals and project bonuses (if any) affect the principle reward only (usually both the PDF and the softcover).</li>
<li>Are the only guaranteed method to get the premium* print copy (NOTE: the softcover versions  in this printing will not be sold on our website: see FAQ for explanation).</li>
<li>Have a simple fulfillment process that does not use Backerkit</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>*Premium means heavyweight glossy interior pages enhancing the art and color elements. The  thick, glossy cardstock brings out the vibrant color of the cover illustration. These are the nicest softcover books we have ever sold and we only print a title this way once.</p>
<p>Any reprint would use print on demand service that, although nice, do not approach the quality of our INDIEGOGO funded books.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1589749935/uxl8fa2hepbk48xfywj5.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Why the Tiny Print Run?</h3>
<p>Since 2012 our crowdfunding approach has been extravagant in every way. Ambitious with massive page counts, plus numerous add-on options and stretch goals. All supporting a primary title itself as many as 990 pages.</p>
<p>This has resulted in Kickstarter's with memorable pledge rewards that include top-quality hardcover books with sometimes dozens of stretch goal bonuses and add-on extras. These are awesome AND they are expensive to buy for customers like you because they are very expensive to make for publishers like us.</p>
<p><strong>Why not use Kickstarter?</strong></p>
<p>We will still be using Kickstarter, frequently, for our large-scale projects, but we hear the request for less expensive options for our products all the time, especially smaller, faster-paced adventures that can be completed in 2-3 sessions.</p>
<p><strong>Product enhancements tied to project success </strong></p>
<p>During the funding period and after the funding goal is met we will  improve the delivered product based on additional sales. There are no special tiered collectors editions or add-on purchase extras. Thus, as total project funding increases, the better the final product will be for everybody.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of improvements made to earlier products:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Additional commissions for interior color art specific to the adventure. </li>
<li>The previous Indiegogo project added 2 interior art pieces and 3 extra creature illustrations for its appendix.</li>
<li>Downloadable Options designed for popular virtual table-top software (The rewards for both How Orcus Stole Christmas! and In Vino Gigantus included the new creature/NPC tokens and player maps). </li>
<li>High-resolution files of illustrations to share with players at the table.<br/> </li>
</ul>

</div></div>","Island of Sorrow is an adventure for characters levels 3-5 that takes them on a journey across the sea to rescue the lost scion of a wealthy merchant family. Tavin Lar hoped to reclaim his family's faltering fortunes by discovering the mythical Island of Sorrows. He found it, but via shipwreck. He sent for help using his last magic scroll, and the rescue mission is under way -- but can our heroes survive long enough to find the mythical island, locate Tavin Lar and bring him home?
In Island of Sorrow you will find:
A complete hex crawl adventure across the mythical island and its savage archipelago.

Rules for ship travel, operation, and adventure.
New monsters ready to tackle any maritime adventure.
More lizardfolk and dinosaurs than you can shake a stick at.*

*Do not shake sticks at lizardfolk and dinosaurs. We are not responsible for character death as a result of ill advised stick shaking. You should probably stay out of the water as well.

The Project 
Frog God Games projects on Indiegogo are simple, focused, and short.

Short in duration (2-3 weeks)
Fast delivery of PDF once funding is completed
Limited to a single title
Have options priced between $5-$30
Stretch goals and project bonuses (if any) affect the principle reward only (usually both the PDF and the softcover).
Are the only guaranteed method to get the premium* print copy (NOTE: the softcover versions  in this printing will not be sold on our website: see FAQ for explanation).
Have a simple fulfillment process that does not use Backerkit

 
*Premium means heavyweight glossy interior pages enhancing the art and color elements. The  thick, glossy cardstock brings out the vibrant color of the cover illustration. These are the nicest softcover books we have ever sold and we only print a title this way once.
Any reprint would use print on demand service that, although nice, do not approach the quality of our INDIEGOGO funded books.

Why the Tiny Print Run?
Since 2012 our crowdfunding approach has been extravagant in every way. Ambitious with massive page counts, plus numerous add-on options and stretch goals. All supporting a primary title itself as many as 990 pages.
This has resulted in Kickstarter's with memorable pledge rewards that include top-quality hardcover books with sometimes dozens of stretch goal bonuses and add-on extras. These are awesome AND they are expensive to buy for customers like you because they are very expensive to make for publishers like us.
Why not use Kickstarter?
We will still be using Kickstarter, frequently, for our large-scale projects, but we hear the request for less expensive options for our products all the time, especially smaller, faster-paced adventures that can be completed in 2-3 sessions.
Product enhancements tied to project success 
During the funding period and after the funding goal is met we will  improve the delivered product based on additional sales. There are no special tiered collectors editions or add-on purchase extras. Thus, as total project funding increases, the better the final product will be for everybody.
Examples of improvements made to earlier products:

Additional commissions for interior color art specific to the adventure. 
The previous Indiegogo project added 2 interior art pieces and 3 extra creature illustrations for its appendix.
Downloadable Options designed for popular virtual table-top software (The rewards for both How Orcus Stole Christmas! and In Vino Gigantus included the new creature/NPC tokens and player maps). 
High-resolution files of illustrations to share with players at the table.
