food trucks are to fine dining. These mobile shops are the artisans of the
industry, delivering high quality products at affordable prices with a certain
mystique attached. No wonder their presence in metropolitan areas has
developed a cult like following, both on the streets and social media alike. We
would love to add our vintage flair to the scene with a renovated 1959
Airstream. 

<p>Spirit Love has been a mobile
boutique for five years. We have morphed with time from selling jewelry to
pulling racks of clothes from our trunk, like a Mary Poppins purse, to sell
from tents at festivals and make-shift shops in homes.  With Spirit Love
experiencing positive growth each of those years, we took a leap and purchased
a mid-century Airstream in great condition this past fall. </p>
<p>Having this space, or Glamstream as
we like to call it, where our shop can be permanently set up, will free up our
time to do a few things we love best. Our top priority is to make women feel
comfortable and beautiful, helping them highlight their best features by
teaching them how to shop for their body type and skin tone. You see, we not only
sell high quality clothes, but we style women for any type of event that’s
important to them - from speaking engagements and weddings to a dinner date or
concert.  </p>
<p>Spirit Love’s renovated Glamstream
will not only free up time to connect with our customers, but also with our
community. Rachael Painter, the owner of Spirit Love, has always wanted our
store to be more than merely “profit-driven.” Because of her heart for women
and community, Spirit Love has gifted special occasion outfits to nominated
women, and supported multiple organizations and charities. This past year we
bought shirts from an organization in Denver, who sustainably work to teach
homeless and at-risk youth a trade, giving them a future other than a life on
the streets. Together, we were able to raise $24,000! Our customer’s got the
chance to be part of something bigger, and we are constantly in search of other
social justice movements to take part in, with a few collaborations in the
works. </p>
<p> We’ve created a shopping
environment where women feel comfortable.<span> 
We understand that shopping can be a daunting task, and for some is not
enjoyable.  We have clothes for real
women – those with curves, and lumps, and scars, and fluff, and the tall and
slender.  So many times we have had women
say, I’ll bet you don’t have anything for me, and we are thrilled that we are
able to help her select a special outfit, without feeling embarrassed that it
doesn’t fit.</span></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Now we need your help. We cannot grow our
community with more empowered, encouraged women, supply chic and affordable designer
apparel,  or reach out to those in need without your assistance. Spirit
Love purchased the Glamstream, and we’ve been working extremely hard with our
own hands in the renovation, but we need to entrust the remainder of the
renovations to a professional. Transforming this dated camper into a modern chic
store, bringing a 60 year old tiny house into this century’s fashion truck
boom, has a price tag of $16,000. We need to reach this goal within 30 days to stay within our projected
timeline of having the Glamstream completed and ready to kick off Colorado's
summer festival season, at the end of May. </p> <p>For supporting us, you'll be rewarded!  You'll be sporting locally sourced items for contributing: a WIN-WIN-WIN!!  <br/>Each level is named after important parts of our renovation, like you, if any part is missing, the whole project falls apart!<br/></p>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>I did a lot of financial modeling at my old job.<b> I'd stare at email and Excel for 9 or more hours a day, and by the end of the day my eyes would hurt...a lot.</b> Many of my friends had similar experiences as they also worked jobs that involved staring at computers all day long: investment banking, consulting, web development, etc.</p>
<p>As I began researching, I learned that Digital Eye Strain really was a thing, but that any glasses to correct for computer screens were marketed and branded towards gamers. I thought about <b>how many other people stare at a computer screen all day long, that would want a pair of affordable, cool glasses.</b> So that's how Felix Gray started. We want to create a stylish brand for computer glasses, where<b> our lenses increase contrast and reduce glare </b>leading to an overall more comfortable work (or digital play) experience.</p>

<div><br/></div>
</div><div>
<h3>The Science</h3>
<p>Our eyes never evolved to stare long hours at things up close;
in fact, they're at rest when looking 20 feet away. When staring at closer
objects, the ciliary muscle in our eye spasms back and forth to adjust.
This strains the eye and makes it tired. Our lenses <b>increase the magnification</b> of our
sight, helping the ciliary muscle better stay at rest. </p>
<p></p>
<p>However, digital devices pose two additional problems: back-glare and static glare.</p>
<p>Back-glare is light that hits the back of traditional lenses and then bounces into your eyes. If you've ever been able to notice the reflection of your eye in the lens, you've experienced pretty bad back-glare. In fact, this glare means that traditional lenses actually can exacerbate the damage that staring at screens cause your eyes. <b>Our anti-reflective coating is a thin, hard film layered onto our lens that reduces this back-glare.</b> Essentially, it equalizes the light reflected from the inner surface on the lens to the light reflected on the outer surface of the lens. In layman terms, it gets rid of the reflection of your screen on your lenses. This creates less interference for your eyes, which allows them to be more relaxed.</p>
<p>In addition, our lenses have a special <b>EMI coating</b> (Electro Magnetic Interference) that works similarly to an anti-reflective coating. However, EMI is special in that it reduces the <b>static glare</b> that digital devices produce. This further helps reduce the stress your computer, iPad, or smartphone will place on your eyes.</p>

The Story
I did a lot of financial modeling at my old job. I'd stare at email and Excel for 9 or more hours a day, and by the end of the day my eyes would hurt...a lot. Many of my friends had similar experiences as they also worked jobs that involved staring at computers all day long: investment banking, consulting, web development, etc.
As I began researching, I learned that Digital Eye Strain really was a thing, but that any glasses to correct for computer screens were marketed and branded towards gamers. I thought about how many other people stare at a computer screen all day long, that would want a pair of affordable, cool glasses. So that's how Felix Gray started. We want to create a stylish brand for computer glasses, where our lenses increase contrast and reduce glare leading to an overall more comfortable work (or digital play) experience.



Testimonials from our Beta TestersPlus, they're wearing their frames!




The Science
Our eyes never evolved to stare long hours at things up close;
in fact, they're at rest when looking 20 feet away. When staring at closer
objects, the ciliary muscle in our eye spasms back and forth to adjust.
This strains the eye and makes it tired. Our lenses increase the magnification of our
sight, helping the ciliary muscle better stay at rest. 

However, digital devices pose two additional problems: back-glare and static glare.
Back-glare is light that hits the back of traditional lenses and then bounces into your eyes. If you've ever been able to notice the reflection of your eye in the lens, you've experienced pretty bad back-glare. In fact, this glare means that traditional lenses actually can exacerbate the damage that staring at screens cause your eyes. Our anti-reflective coating is a thin, hard film layered onto our lens that reduces this back-glare. Essentially, it equalizes the light reflected from the inner surface on the lens to the light reflected on the outer surface of the lens. In layman terms, it gets rid of the reflection of your screen on your lenses. This creates less interference for your eyes, which allows them to be more relaxed.
In addition, our lenses have a special EMI coating (Electro Magnetic Interference) that works similarly to an anti-reflective coating. However, EMI is special in that it reduces the static glare that digital devices produce. This further helps reduce the stress your computer, iPad, or smartphone will place on your eyes.

The Numbers









  Our Needs & Your Wants 
Producing eyeglasses are expensive. Especially ones that use
cellulose acetate to create beautiful frames in amazing colors and patterns and
high quality lenses with special coatings to reduce stress from digital
devices. Completing our goal will allow us to produce 3 frame styles; if we fall short, we’ll produce as many frame styles as we can with the cash on hand.

<div>Dive watches are some of the most popular and historically important watches. However, some are just too expensive for many buyers and “affordable” dive watches are often big and heavy while also disappointing with the movements they offer. By cutting out the middleman, SCURO watches are able to provide a rugged yet handsome watch made of titanium, in a thin 11mm thick case. The signature bezel adds a touch of contemporary styling while being discreet enough to allow SCURO watches to exemplify dive watch design. Our design goal was simple: create a no-compromise dive watch that respects history but utilizes cutting edge materials.</div>

<p><strong>The Titanium Case  </strong></p>
<p>Titanium is a very popular material choice for high-end watches for three main reasons: -</p>
<p>First off, it is about five times stronger than steel, making the SCURO watch far more durable than even costlier alternatives on the market.</p>
<p> -Titanium is about half the weight of steel with a density of 4.5g/cc vs. 7.8g/cc for steel. </p>
<p> -Finally, titanium is highly corrosion resistant. This means no rusting and has the added benefit of being hypoallergenic.</p>

<div><strong>Custom S logo crown. 11 mm Thin case only weight 40g without strap.</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Measuring 40mm in diameter with a thickness of 11mm, the model S Titanium watch case is fitted with a scratch resistant anti-reflective Sapphire crystal and a solid Titanium screw caseback. These dimensions make for a very wearable piece that is ideally proportioned and allow for versatility while allowing a water resistance of 200 meters. It’s dive ready with a nicely gripped and simple dive bezel. Thanks to the titanium case, the SCURO model S watch weighs just 40 grams. The SCURO Titanium is features a Miyota 9015 caliber movement. This solid, reliable movement has a 42 hour power reserve, 24 jewels, and a classic three hand display with discreet date display at six o'clock. The spec of the Japanese 9015 is a conscious one that brings with it many benefits. For starters it’s more than a match for its Swiss counterparts on all levels; from accuracy to reliability. Smooth with a decent power reserve it’s an automatic movement that can be hand wound and features a hacking seconds hand for syncing to your chosen time zone. The movement runs at 28,800 vibrations per hour with a power reserve of 42 hours. Granted, there are movements out there with bigger reserves and faster sweeps but they come at a price and tend to spend more time on the work bench. We simply want the model S to spend more time on the wrist. It’s also a nice thin movement, which means we can keep things slim in the case without losing strength.</div>

<div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470663583/hbmozlfte2gnhiumwjks.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT FEATURES OF THE MIYOTA 9015 AUTOMATIC / MANUAL WINDING</strong></p>
<p>The 9015 is powered up by either an oscillating movement of it’s weighted rotor through natural counter clockwise movements. Or manually winding it by the crown. Just pull the crown to position “A” and turn roughly 20 times</p>
<p><strong>HACKING SECOND HAND</strong></p>
<p>Hacking function allows the second hand to completely stop while setting the time. Crown must be pulled to time setting position for the second hand to stop. This is done for precise synchronization between multiple time keeping sources</p>
<p><strong>VIBRATIONS PER HOUR</strong></p>
<p>The standard for modern watches is 28,800 vibrations per hour. Our Miyota 9015 is no different. Beating at 28,800 per hour allows for more precision and greater likelihood to keep accurate time. Higher rates on the other hand can effectively maintain greater accuracy but also lead to more time on the work bench</p>
<p><strong>POWER RESERVE</strong></p>
<p>This particular movement can last, on average, 42 hours between complete power ups. After a days work once you remove your watch and place it back in your black leather roll it can sit motionless for roughly 42 hours before being completely out of power. But you’re not going to let this baby sit are ya?</p>

Crown & Bezel are in the same design style​
 
Dive watches are some of the most popular and historically important watches. However, some are just too expensive for many buyers and “affordable” dive watches are often big and heavy while also disappointing with the movements they offer. By cutting out the middleman, SCURO watches are able to provide a rugged yet handsome watch made of titanium, in a thin 11mm thick case. The signature bezel adds a touch of contemporary styling while being discreet enough to allow SCURO watches to exemplify dive watch design. Our design goal was simple: create a no-compromise dive watch that respects history but utilizes cutting edge materials.

The Titanium Case  
Titanium is a very popular material choice for high-end watches for three main reasons: -
First off, it is about five times stronger than steel, making the SCURO watch far more durable than even costlier alternatives on the market.
 -Titanium is about half the weight of steel with a density of 4.5g/cc vs. 7.8g/cc for steel. 
 -Finally, titanium is highly corrosion resistant. This means no rusting and has the added benefit of being hypoallergenic.


Custom S logo crown. 11 mm Thin case only weight 40g without strap.
 
Measuring 40mm in diameter with a thickness of 11mm, the model S Titanium watch case is fitted with a scratch resistant anti-reflective Sapphire crystal and a solid Titanium screw caseback. These dimensions make for a very wearable piece that is ideally proportioned and allow for versatility while allowing a water resistance of 200 meters. It’s dive ready with a nicely gripped and simple dive bezel. Thanks to the titanium case, the SCURO model S watch weighs just 40 grams. The SCURO Titanium is features a Miyota 9015 caliber movement. This solid, reliable movement has a 42 hour power reserve, 24 jewels, and a classic three hand display with discreet date display at six o'clock. The spec of the Japanese 9015 is a conscious one that brings with it many benefits. For starters it’s more than a match for its Swiss counterparts on all levels; from accuracy to reliability. Smooth with a decent power reserve it’s an automatic movement that can be hand wound and features a hacking seconds hand for syncing to your chosen time zone. The movement runs at 28,800 vibrations per hour with a power reserve of 42 hours. Granted, there are movements out there with bigger reserves and faster sweeps but they come at a price and tend to spend more time on the work bench. We simply want the model S to spend more time on the wrist. It’s also a nice thin movement, which means we can keep things slim in the case without losing strength.
 


 
IMPORTANT FEATURES OF THE MIYOTA 9015 AUTOMATIC / MANUAL WINDING
The 9015 is powered up by either an oscillating movement of it’s weighted rotor through natural counter clockwise movements. Or manually winding it by the crown. Just pull the crown to position “A” and turn roughly 20 times
HACKING SECOND HAND
Hacking function allows the second hand to completely stop while setting the time. Crown must be pulled to time setting position for the second hand to stop. This is done for precise synchronization between multiple time keeping sources
VIBRATIONS PER HOUR
The standard for modern watches is 28,800 vibrations per hour. Our Miyota 9015 is no different. Beating at 28,800 per hour allows for more precision and greater likelihood to keep accurate time. Higher rates on the other hand can effectively maintain greater accuracy but also lead to more time on the work bench
POWER RESERVE
This particular movement can last, on average, 42 hours between complete power ups. After a days work once you remove your watch and place it back in your black leather roll it can sit motionless for roughly 42 hours before being completely out of power. But you’re not going to let this baby sit are ya?

Once our campaign ends, we will immediately place the orders with our manufacturers. Depending on how large the orders are, production will most likely take between sixty to ninety days. We want our backers to receive their watches as quickly as possible without sacrificing their quality. The watches will be individually inspected once they arrived. There will be full disclosure with our backers and they will be updated every step along the way. Thank you so much for being a part of this project!  
We Need Your Help !
In order to keep costs reasonable, we need to order a minimum quantity of watches. By becoming a backer of our project, you will help cover a portion of production costs in exchange for a cool, fun & premium quality timepiece at a highly discounted price!
How the funds will be used
Our Plan & We Need Your Support to build SCURO watches!
We are now ready to make the SCURO model S Titanium watches available to our backers. We have completed the final design and all specifications. We have been testing several prototypes and are fully satisfied with the look, feel and quality of the watch. Our manufacturing partners have confirmed that they are ready to start production as soon as we give them the go-ahead. Once we place the order with our suppliers, they will start the manufacturing and assembly of the different parts of the watch. The completed and assembled watches will then be shipped to us for final inspection and testing. The only thing missing is the initial order fee. I need to order a minimum quantity of watches in order to get the best deal and that's where you come in to make this mission to become a reality and it will not happen without your support. By becoming a backer for this project, you help us fund the first production run and to make this awesome watch to life, not to mention you score an cool & premium quality watch at a huge discount!
Risks and challenges
We realize creating and delivering a product is a complicated process and often comes with unexpected challenges. That is why we have been preparing. We gained tremendous experience through our previous SCURO watch project before with the manufacturer. We have spent the past several months making sure our supply chain is in check. We have well-established relationships with reliable watch manufacturers. We have experienced and we are prepared to deal with fulfillment of goods. We also have contingency plans for all the steps that are out of our control. We are going to keep our backers informed during the production process. We'll do this with regular updates and sharing pictures as often as possible, for example when manufacturing of the watch cases is completed, during manufacturing of components, during final assembly, when the packaging is produced, etc… If somewhere along the way we find that there is a setback in production, or that we cannot make the timeline, we will keep all of our backers informed. In the end, we want to make SCURO a long-lasting brand of affordable watches. We will do whatever it takes to fulfill our promises and to deliver watches that will exceed our backers’ expectations!
Thank you! Thank you for your support. Please remember to pledge and make this cool, fun and premium quality watch a reality.

 - Traditional belts with holes can be frustrating. Having the holes one
 inch apart means your belt is either too tight or too loose most of the
 time. Railtek Belts has replaced the hole with a Rail System on the 
back side of the belt which gives you roughly 44 sizing options 1/4 inch
 apart! Incremental adjustment makes for a PERFECT FIT!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/206413/files/20131118085556-Railtek_Advantage-belt.jpg?1384793756"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><a href=""http://www.railtekbelts.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.RailtekBelts.com</a><br/></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/206411/files/20131118085459-sizes.jpg?1384793699"" src="""" style=""""/><p></p><p><b>#2 Unique Buckle System </b>- Behind the scene of each buckle

 size but just in case it is a little too large and has that annoying 
overhang, you can cut your belt to size. This way it is meant just for 
you. Simply detach the belt from the buckle, cut, and reclamp. (see 
section below on <i>How to Custom Fit</i>)<p></p><h1>HOW TO USE</h1><p>  <a href=""http://www.railtekbelts.com/info/How_to"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Using a Railtek Belt</a> couldn't be easier! Simply insert the belt
 into the buckle and you will hear it start clicking as the rail on the 
belt ratchets with the buckle (step 1). Cinch it up to your desired 
tightness and you are now rockin' the coolest belt on the market.</p><p> 
 To remove or loosen your belt, use your left index finger to locate the lever 
on the bottom of the buckle and pivot the lever away from your body (step 2). 
You may need to relieve the tension in the buckle by slightly pushing 
the belt in with your right hand (as though you are tightening it) before flipping the lever.</p><p>  
You'll notice that you are able to adjust your belt 1/4 of an inch at a 
time which makes it convenient and easier to get that perfect fit...no 
matter how much you had to eat for lunch. Once you try it, you'll wonder
 why you let anything else hold up your pants!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/206445/files/20131118090240-operate_all.jpg?1384794160"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/206444/files/20131118090205-tight-loose.jpg?1384794125"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><a href=""http://www.railtekbelts.com/info/How_to"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><p>

the belt clamp (step 1). Use a good pair of scissors and cut the desired
 length off the end of the belt (step 2). The length that is cut is

</h1>  From 2005-2007, I lived overseas in an East European country. I was out and about nearly every day talking to people so dressing up and looking presentable was a must. As time went by I realized that there wasn't much variation in my fashion. Ties, belts, watches, and shoes seemed as if they were the only option to express some sense of style. One day as I was browsing through an outdoor market, I ran across an interesting belt. But was it a belt? There were no holes so how did it keep your pants up? Investigating further, I discovered the most intriguing buckle system that worked with a rail on the back of the belt. I had never seen this before! It only took a few seconds of investigation and moments later I was the proud owner of this new-way to hold up my britches! Over the course of the next week I realized that not only was this new belt very stylish but it may just be the solution to my fluctuating weight! I was no longer restricted to the daunting gap between holes of traditional belts; I could adjust 1/4 of an inch at a time in either direction...Amazing!<br/><br/>  As my time in Eastern Europe came to a close, I purchased a couple of belts to bring back with me. From then until the fall of 2012 I wore those belts almost every day. Many times I thought, ""People would love these!"" This thought inspired me to develop a business plan to introduce the American people to my favorite belt. What would I call it? <b>Railtek Belts</b>.<p></p><h1>THE PLAN<br/>
</h1>  <strike>Upon successful completion of this project, a production order will be submitted to our manufacturer to begin production of the belts. This process will take anywhere from 30-40 days. Once complete, the belts will be shipped to our office in Salt Lake City, Utah, where we will repackage and ship your rewards to you! Turn around time depends on the number of orders that need to be fulfilled but expect your belt to be sent out no later than two weeks after we have received the bulk shipment from our manufacturer.</strike><br/><i><br/>Because we have chosen the Flex Funding option and have received an early shipment of belts, we have started fulfilling orders.

is a unique buckle system that interacts with the rail on the belt using
 a lever and a magnet. The use of a magnet ensures that your buckle will
 not wear out over time like buckles with springs would.
#3 Customization - Our belts can fit up to a 42 inch waist
 size but just in case it is a little too large and has that annoying 
overhang, you can cut your belt to size. This way it is meant just for 
you. Simply detach the belt from the buckle, cut, and reclamp. (see 
section below on How to Custom Fit)HOW TO USE  Using a Railtek Belt couldn't be easier! Simply insert the belt
 into the buckle and you will hear it start clicking as the rail on the 
belt ratchets with the buckle (step 1). Cinch it up to your desired 
tightness and you are now rockin' the coolest belt on the market. 
 To remove or loosen your belt, use your left index finger to locate the lever 
on the bottom of the buckle and pivot the lever away from your body (step 2). 
You may need to relieve the tension in the buckle by slightly pushing 
the belt in with your right hand (as though you are tightening it) before flipping the lever.  
You'll notice that you are able to adjust your belt 1/4 of an inch at a 
time which makes it convenient and easier to get that perfect fit...no 
matter how much you had to eat for lunch. Once you try it, you'll wonder
 why you let anything else hold up your pants!
HOW TO CUSTOM FIT  Every Railtek Belt can be custom fit to your exact size. This means 
that you can make your belt fit instead of searching around for one that
 almost fits. To do this, detach the belt from the buckle by lifting up 
the belt clamp (step 1). Use a good pair of scissors and cut the desired
 length off the end of the belt (step 2). The length that is cut is 
determined by how much overhang there is when the belt is worn at its 
desired tightness. After cutting, reinsert the belt all the way into
 the buckle and close the belt clamp (step 3). Now your belt is made 
just for you!OUR THREE DESIGNS  We wanted to create designs that you
 would want to wear with anything from suits to jeans. Each buckle 
incorporates a mixture of casual presence and stylish dominance. Below 
are our three designs.www.RailtekBelts.comwww.RailtekBelts.comHOW IT ALL STARTED
  From 2005-2007, I lived overseas in an East European country. I was out and about nearly every day talking to people so dressing up and looking presentable was a must. As time went by I realized that there wasn't much variation in my fashion. Ties, belts, watches, and shoes seemed as if they were the only option to express some sense of style. One day as I was browsing through an outdoor market, I ran across an interesting belt. But was it a belt? There were no holes so how did it keep your pants up? Investigating further, I discovered the most intriguing buckle system that worked with a rail on the back of the belt. I had never seen this before! It only took a few seconds of investigation and moments later I was the proud owner of this new-way to hold up my britches! Over the course of the next week I realized that not only was this new belt very stylish but it may just be the solution to my fluctuating weight! I was no longer restricted to the daunting gap between holes of traditional belts; I could adjust 1/4 of an inch at a time in either direction...Amazing!  As my time in Eastern Europe came to a close, I purchased a couple of belts to bring back with me. From then until the fall of 2012 I wore those belts almost every day. Many times I thought, ""People would love these!"" This thought inspired me to develop a business plan to introduce the American people to my favorite belt. What would I call it? Railtek Belts.THE PLAN
  Upon successful completion of this project, a production order will be submitted to our manufacturer to begin production of the belts. This process will take anywhere from 30-40 days. Once complete, the belts will be shipped to our office in Salt Lake City, Utah, where we will repackage and ship your rewards to you! Turn around time depends on the number of orders that need to be fulfilled but expect your belt to be sent out no later than two weeks after we have received the bulk shipment from our manufacturer.Because we have chosen the Flex Funding option and have received an early shipment of belts, we have started fulfilling orders. Perks can be received for Christmas if made before a certain date (See Updates tab)...So contribute now!Thank you for any of your contributions; every bit helps.

You just need to measure, as you can see the picture, the lenght of the curve of your cups.Measure your size in both curve lines, vertical and horizontal./ How to measure for bottomHip Measurement: Stand on a level surface with feet together. Measure around fullets part covered on hips and bottom (few cm below waitsline), keeping tape parallel with floor. You just need to measure the part of your body you want to be covered by the bottom, as showed in the photo.  Frambosia is a new luxury fashion brand created to change your mind and bring to you a new concept of swimwear.

Handmade traditions all handcrafted with meticulous detail.“Since I was a child, my idea has always been to find out solutions to necessities. I realized that when women are at the beach or swimming pool or enjoying their free time, have really troubles to get a great tan due to the bikini lines. They had just 2 options, topless or keeping the bikini with the straps and changing it every day to avoid the tan lines, but this is not effective. So I came up with the idea of apply this technology on the bikinis. Now women can enjoy their time on the beach, beach club, swimming pool, or wherever and get the ideal tan, even they can carefully enjoy the water.”/ WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT We've been working on Frambosia Ideal bikini for over a year.

<p>We are Sunglasses For Sport Ltd (<a href=""http://www.sunglassesforsport.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.sunglassesforsport.com</a>), established in 2007 and now one of the UK’s leading online retailers for sports sunglasses and sports eyewear with a sizeable customer base. </p>
<p>We are looking for £12 each from 500 individual contributors with an objective of raising £6000 to help fund the manufacture of a new range of sports safety eyewear. In return each £12 contributor gets 2 of the new model in 2 different lens colours worth £30.</p>
<p>One of the 18 brands of eyewear we sell is our own-label range called Evolution which is made especially for us by different factories in the Far East. Evolution has been a great success story and we sell around 15000 units a year to both consumers and trade customers. </p>
<p>Over the last 2-3 years we have had numerous trade enquiries for safety eyewear including one request to tender for 20,000 units. We take the view that if we add safety eyewear models to our Evolution range they must look good - with some style - and bear no resemblance to the type of functional, industrial looking safety eyewear you might find in builders merchants.</p>
<p>Working with the largest safety eyewear manufacturer in Taiwan we have identified the ideal model which we'll call Evolution Hunter. To be successful safety eyewear must comply with the European standard EN166 and European Directive 89/686/EEC. We have already submitted the model for testing (to meet these standards) to INSPEC, the internationally recognised UKAS accredited test house.</p>
<p>Evolution Hunter will have 4 colour variants of the eyewear: clear, yellow, grey and grey with a blue mirror finish.</p>
<p>Technically, the new Evolution Hunter range will be  high specification, featuring Class 1 lenses, anti-fog coatings (to both sides of the lenses), full impact protection (meeting EN166), polycarbonate shatterproof lenses and UV400 rated lenses providing the maximum protection from harmful UVR. Importantly, it will also look good - we believe a winning combination of style and performance. It will retail at £15 each which is competitive for high quality sports style safety eyewear.</p>
<p>There are numerous different markets for safety eyewear. Trade customers will include:<br/>•    Building and construction companies<br/>•    Rail maintenance companies<br/>•    Medical companies and laboratories<br/>•    Hardware distributors supplying factories etc  <br/>•    Civil engineering companies<br/>•    Shooting schools and shooting grounds</p>
<p>We will also sell direct to consumers via our website; customers will include cyclists, shooting enthusiasts, archery enthusiasts and airsoft BB enthusiasts. Airsoft BB is a rapidly growing sport that has taken over from paintballing.</p>
<p>The minimum factory order is 1500 per colour so for the four colours we need to place an initial order for 6000 units which is why we are seeking help with the funding. The order will be placed with the factory in mid-December of this year and it will take 45 days for manufacture.</p>
<p>We are looking for £12 each from 500 contributors to raise £6000 in funding. What each individual contributor gets is 2 different lens colours. This is one of the grey colour models (plain grey <strong>or</strong> the grey with mirror finish), plus a clear or yellow colour (their choice). So they will get £30 worth of eyewear for £12 and we will include a protective soft carry pouch for each one. We will be able to deliver the two colours to each contributor around mid-February 2017 and certainly no later than the end of February.</p>
<p>This eyewear can be used around the home &amp; garden to protect eyes (DIY, gardening etc) and for many different sports. Even though it's categorised as safety eyewear  the grey lens model (with or without mirror) is no different to any other stylish looking sports style sunglass, providing maximum protection from harmful UVR.</p>

</div> <p>Boondocks is a Canadian company aiming to provide the most functional, durable leather on the planet, without compromising the health of it.</p>
<p>After the realization that some of the most popular leather companies are putting profits ahead of quality, and that designs could be significantly improved, Boondocks was started.</p>
<p>By helping Boondocks, you'll be helping the planet. A huge percentage of leather made today is made with harmful chemicals. Sure, it is cheaper. But the cost is not merely financial. The planet pays part of the price. By purchasing leather tanned with natural plant compounds, you'll be respecting the environment rather than destroying it.</p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Perks and Use of Funds</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Whether you need a bag for travel, camping, business, hiking, school, or protection of electronics, you'll find something that you can use.</div>
<div>Each Boondocks item is protected by a 150 year warranty. If your Boondocks item breaks down enough to require a repair, send it back. You pay the shipping, the repair work is free of charge. If the item can't be fixed, it gets replaced!</div>
<div>Boondocks items can be either <b>black like the Raider bag</b>, <b>dark brown like the Nomad backpack,</b> or a <b>red and brown mixture like the drawstring on the Boonie backpack.</b>
</div>
<div>
<b>Note also that when you see that interior pockets are a feature, they are the same quality of leather as the exterior leather, NOT a cheap lining! The leather used is very thick and is smooth on both sides, not hairy, and does not need a lining.</b><br/>

<h3><strong>What is full grain leather? What is vegetable tanning? What type of leather does Boondocks use?</strong></h3>
<div><strong>Boondocks uses thick, full grain, vegetable-tanned water buffalo hides.<br/></strong></div>
<p><strong>Full grain leather</strong> is the best quality leather you can buy. It is from the top of the hide, where the fibers are intertwined and tangled, resulting in extremely high strength.</p>
<p><strong>Top grain leather </strong>from just below that. People use it to avoid the outer layer of the skin, which could have scars on it. It isn't too bad.</p>
<p><strong>Genuine leather </strong>is from even lower on the hide. When you see the word ""genuine"", you may be inclined to think that it simply means that you're looking at real leather. And sure, it may be. But coming from an even lower layer of the hide, its fibers are much less intertwined and closer to being flat. That means it isn't as strong as full grain or top grain. So you probably want to avoid it if you are looking for good quality leather.</p>
<p>Then there is <strong>bonded leather</strong>. Watch out for it. Particles of leather are glued and mashed together. It may even be stamped in an effort to make it look like full grain. Sort of like a fast food hamburger bun. You know, the white bread that is stripped of basically all of its nutritional value with some seeds thrown on top to give it the appearance of a healthy, whole grain bread. </p>
<p><strong>Vegetable tanning </strong>is the process of tanning hide by infusing plant extract. Organic compounds are taken from bark, branches, leaves, and sometimes fruits. An age-old way. It is better for the environment and human health than toxic alternatives.</p>
<h3><strong>Why water buffalo? Why not cow?</strong></h3>
<p>Water buffalo skin is used to protect against crocodiles, lions, and tigers. There is actually a video online showing a water buffalo <strong>calf</strong> <strong>walking away </strong>after an attack by multiple lions and a crocodile. That is a great example of the protective quality of water buffalo skin.</p>
<p>Besides that, cow leather is nice, but so common! Who doesn't own something made of cow? Water buffalo is exotic (for a lot of people). When you combine a rarer animal with a rare, less-practiced sewing style, you get a rare, exotic product that very few people own.</p>
<h3><strong>Is the leather waterproof?</strong></h3>
<p>It actually seems to enjoy the water. It might have something to do with the fact that water buffalo are practically amphibious.</p>
<p>They don't live in the ocean, though. So salt water is a different story.</p>
<h3><strong>Why do you hand-stitch? Wouldn't it be faster to use a machine?</strong></h3>
<p>Hand stitching is superior in strength compared to the typical machine stitch.</p>
<p>The handmade way is reclaiming the popularity it once had. It is not only the way of the past, but it is the way of the future.</p>
<h3><strong>Why do you use hemp for the stitching?</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>Why should I spend this much?</strong></h3>
<p>Cheap items rarely last long, function as well, or look as good as more expensive ones.</p>
<p>Some people may think that they are getting a ""good deal"" when they buy something that is extraordinarily inexpensive. Strangely, though, they don't give much consideration to the chance that the item they are buying could need multiple replacements over the next few years, costing them <em>more</em> money than they would have spent if they had purchased the higher quality alternative in the first place.</p>
<p>Considering those points, the fact that all of the materials used to make each Boondocks product are very expensive, and that a great amount of effort is necessary to craft each item, the answer is obvious.</p>
<p>So invest in your future. Buy nice or buy thrice!</p>
<h3><strong>Does Boondocks ever put on any sales?</strong></h3>
<p>Not other than the campaign, no. So there isn't any point in waiting to get a better price!</p>

</div></div>","About





 Boondocks is a Canadian company aiming to provide the most functional, durable leather on the planet, without compromising the health of it.
After the realization that some of the most popular leather companies are putting profits ahead of quality, and that designs could be significantly improved, Boondocks was started.
By helping Boondocks, you'll be helping the planet. A huge percentage of leather made today is made with harmful chemicals. Sure, it is cheaper. But the cost is not merely financial. The planet pays part of the price. By purchasing leather tanned with natural plant compounds, you'll be respecting the environment rather than destroying it.   
Perks and Use of Funds

Whether you need a bag for travel, camping, business, hiking, school, or protection of electronics, you'll find something that you can use.
Each Boondocks item is protected by a 150 year warranty. If your Boondocks item breaks down enough to require a repair, send it back. You pay the shipping, the repair work is free of charge. If the item can't be fixed, it gets replaced!
Boondocks items can be either black like the Raider bag, dark brown like the Nomad backpack, or a red and brown mixture like the drawstring on the Boonie backpack.


Note also that when you see that interior pockets are a feature, they are the same quality of leather as the exterior leather, NOT a cheap lining! The leather used is very thick and is smooth on both sides, not hairy, and does not need a lining.

What will funds be used for?





 Quality leather is not cheap. And vegetable-tanning is a very long process. Hides are not produced at a rapid rate, so colors aren't always easy to find. Maybe that's why they are called hides.
With the funds from this campaign, Boondocks will be able to purchase a large amount of hides of different colors. That means that products will be able to be developed and shipped more quickly.
Properly-made tools can also be very expensive. Low quality stuff can break easily. That slows production down. So some funds will also be spent on high-quality equipment.
Custom stamps will also be purchased to place the Boondocks logo on products. Don't worry, though. It won't be flashy or distracting.

     A Global Impact
There needs to be a change in modern business practices. Outsourcing, cheap materials, and a lack of quality are plagues that are much too common.
Not only do they damage the economy, but they make life harder in general. It truly isn't fun to have to replace an important item that you spent a lot of money on and that has meaning to you. And you don't want to get caught out in the boonies with a bag that falls apart under demanding conditions.

If you want the best leather you can buy, you need to take multiple factors into consideration. Leather items are actually quite complicated, and there is a huge variety of types of hides, threads, and hardware. Avoiding easily-breakable parts like zippers, cheap fabric linings, and hollow rivets is very important. For a comparison and explanation of the quality of Boondocks leather to that of the competition, look at http://www.boondocksleathercanada.com/details/

   It is Easy to Help! Spreading the word is now the main challenge for Boondocks, since suppliers have been found and product designs made.
Understandably, some people can't contribute financially.
There are other ways to help, though!
Post about Boondocks online. Tell people you know. Remember to check the campaign page frequently for updates.

Note that the products shown are prototypes, so expect some very slight modifications. The modifications are improvements! Hardware will be solid brass, some flaps will be widened for extra protection from rain, and some straps may be slightly lengthened, which makes it easier to use them when you have to carry a lot of items!",24.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Frequently asked questions : from backers</h3>
<p><b>- Is the wallet safe?  </b>GOQI wallets have heat sensor units attached to both the batteries and to the transmitter, and will automatically reduce the power output of the system in the event of overheating past 55 degrees.  The Qi wireless standard emits very minimal electromagnetic waves which are safe for humans.<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">  </span></p>
<p><b>- Will it work with my phone?  </b>GOQI wallets are currently based on Qi wireless technology which is a wireless induction charging method.  There are many cell phones on the market which support this wireless technology, including the new iphone8,8+,X and also most Samsung phones.   Other phones only require a thin charging coil to be placed behind the battery. These can be easily purchased over the web, however we have offered you 2 types of receivers to purchase, which are compatible with most iphones and android phones.   These can be purchased at <a href=""http://www.goqiwireless.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.goqiwireless.com</a></p>
<p><b>- How long will the battery last?  </b>Because every type of phone has a different battery capacity, we can only estimate that a 4000mAH battery can charge a standard iphone 6+  1x wirelessly and 2x with wire.  We suggest that you do not run your phone dry before recharging your phone on the wallet and for faster charge to use the wired option.  We have found that portable power banks have a 30% battery wastage and wireless charging has a further 30% loss in efficiency, so if you are looking for a fast charge we recommend you use the cable option we have.</p>
<p><b>- Will my credit cards be affected?  </b>Most modern credit cards use chips now rather than magnetic strips so the magnetic field from the coils will not affect them.  Old style magnetic strip cards may be affected by magnetic induction charging, however we have installed protection plates between the transmitter and receivers coils which will help minimise any issues you may have.  With our Continental style the card section is also separated from the main transmitter, therefore minimising this issue.  Our own personal testing has not raised any issues to date.</p>
<p><b>- Does it come it other styles or colours?  </b>Based on demand we have increased our offering with vegan leather, sports canvas and high quality leathers.</p>
<p><b>- How heavy and large is it?    </b>The Long wallet is 300g and 19cm x 10cm x 2.5cm.  Travel wallet is 587g and size is  22.5cm long x 12.5cm wide x 4cm deep.  </p>
<p><b>- Can I repair it myself?  </b>As we are professional manufacturers of these wallets, we strongly suggest that you do not attempt to self repair a GOQI wallet.  We have redesigned the new wallet to enable simpler repairs if necessary by professionals.</p>

THE ORIGINAL GOQI TRAVEL WALLET : DESIGNED FOR BUSINESS OR LEISURE
This stylish double zipper wallet keeps your travel documents, boarding pass, cards, pen coins, jewelry and money in one place and keeps your devices fully charged while you travel.
We are travelers too and understand that being organised is the key to a smooth and stress free trip.

 

 

THREE WIRELESS ""PHONE"" CHARGING OPTIONS
1. Flat back       2. Back slip     3. Inside compartment
 ______________________________________


WIRELESSLY RECHARGING THE WALLET
The GOQI Continental wallet was designed so that it not only charges your phones wireless, but itself is also charged wirelessly when placed on a wireless charging station.
A complete wireless charging solution. 
 

We understand that not everywhere will have wireless charging stations, so wired charging is also an option.  You can charge it from any laptop, computer, power strip or wall socket via our USB(A) cable.

______________________________________POWERING UP AND DOWN THE GOQI WALLET WITH A SIMPLE PRESS.

 
For your safety and unnecessary battery waste, we have designed an elegant, hidden on/off button on the gusset of the wallet. 
______________________________________
SNUG AND SECURE WITH TIME, DATES AND NOTIFICATIONS VISIBLE
 

 
We designed the slip compartment because we know you want to review your messages, see the time or charging level, when you are charging.  We know we do. 
______________________________________
EASY CHARGING OF WEARABLE TECH GADGETS
There are many charging methods for each tech gadget out there, so we  offer a micro USB cable with the GOQI Continental wallet.  You can charge your watches, trackers, headsets, rings and glasses with the appropriate adaptor.

_______________________________________
HIGH QUALITY MATERIALS & ATTENTION TO DETAIL

As leather product specialists for over 30 years, we have selected the finest leathers which will pass the test of time.  Metal components and workmanship are also inspected to ensure its finishing will last.  Workmanship is carried out by the best craftsmen in the leather business who make for many famous international brands.
_______________________________________
DESIGNED AND MADE WITH DEDICATION AND PASSION
       
Working with the best in leather accessories and wireless charging technology, we are able to capture the opportunities of scaling up production to international standards, without compromising our dedication and passion.  _______________________________________ A PASSION FOR CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT AND A VISION OF A GRAND FUTURE FOR WIRELESS WEARABLES.

We have tried out of hundreds of iterations.  Here are 12 of them planned for future versions when our campaign is a success.______________________________________
OUR HOPES, DREAMS, BELIEF AND VISION

A couple of awards for best of small accessory design along the way and a lot of hard work to go with it, travelling the world. We are launching the GOQI wallets after many years of designing, making and selling leather bags and accessories.  With a strong belief that there are too many wires in our life and a vision to start eliminating some of them, we hope you can support us and other wireless charging companies so that we can keep reiterating towards the perfect wireless charging accessory.
We have also designed a method to incorporate GOQI tech into your favourite branded accessories so that your business satchels and handbags will be able to charge all your accessories wirelessly.  We are currently in talks with brands at the moment.
By supporting our first step, you will help validate that the time for wireless charging has come.

Frequently asked questions : from backers
- Is the wallet safe?  GOQI wallets have heat sensor units attached to both the batteries and to the transmitter, and will automatically reduce the power output of the system in the event of overheating past 55 degrees.  The Qi wireless standard emits very minimal electromagnetic waves which are safe for humans.  
- Will it work with my phone?  GOQI wallets are currently based on Qi wireless technology which is a wireless induction charging method.  There are many cell phones on the market which support this wireless technology, including the new iphone8,8+,X and also most Samsung phones.   Other phones only require a thin charging coil to be placed behind the battery. These can be easily purchased over the web, however we have offered you 2 types of receivers to purchase, which are compatible with most iphones and android phones.   These can be purchased at www.goqiwireless.com
- How long will the battery last?  Because every type of phone has a different battery capacity, we can only estimate that a 4000mAH battery can charge a standard iphone 6+  1x wirelessly and 2x with wire.  We suggest that you do not run your phone dry before recharging your phone on the wallet and for faster charge to use the wired option.  We have found that portable power banks have a 30% battery wastage and wireless charging has a further 30% loss in efficiency, so if you are looking for a fast charge we recommend you use the cable option we have.

<h3>The Shamagh Project Story</h3>
<p>My name is Majd and I am a Jordanian currently living in Texas.  I moved to the US around a year ago, and have made the states my home.  </p>
<p>I have worked with American students in Jordan for years, and one of my favorite moments with each group is taking them to visit Petra and Wadi Rum, two breathtaking sites in southern Jordan, where my family’s history began.  The Shamagh becomes a trademark and staple item of each trip; it protects my new foreign friends’ faces from the flying red dust as we barrel through the desert on 4x4’s, and shields their heads from the sun as we walk through the exposed siq of Petra in the footsteps of civilizations past.</p>
<p>This square piece of colorful cotton, adorned with tassels and handcrafted in the workshops of my homeland, is full of memories of cultural exploration.  Over the past ten months, since I stepped foot in the USA for the first time, I am consistently experiencing moments of cultural exploration as I struggle and strive to make a foreign place home and connect with the community around me.  Texas may seem like an unexpected settling spot for a Bedouin from the Middle East, but after visiting around twenty cities since I arrived in the US, I have found that the people here are so welcoming and enjoy a familiar way of life. The Lone Star state was one of many inspirations for <i><strong>The Shamagh Project</strong></i>, which is a reflection of my mission to create meaningful cultural fusion between the US and the Middle East.</p>
<p>I have created a final prototype for my American-inspired Shamagh, and hope to create a line of customizable scarves based in the same traditional pattern.  The funding from this campaign will allow me to order a large quantity of my design, and start working on new designs.  My dream is for the wearer to represent their pride on their chest, or head, or back - whether it be their state, city, university, favorite sports team, or social cause.</p>
<div>
<h3>Uncovering the History of the Shamagh:</h3>
<p>The red and white checkered headdress of my homeland has been around for thousands of years, before Islam, Christianity, and Judaism began in the Middle East.  It originated in the village of Shamakh (neighboring my home village of Shobak) in southern Jordan, and stayed resilient as a signature wardrobe piece throughout the Edomite, Moabite, and Nabatean Kingdoms of Jordan.  These kingdoms reached through Iraq to the Arab Gulf, and across Jordan to Syria.</p>
<p>Over time, through the developing of the Arabic and Sumerian languages, the head and neck covering from the village of Shamakh came to be known as the <i>shamagh.  </i>Its most traditional representation is red and white, with the red color coming from the Jordanian poppy that dots the country's landscape during the spring season, and the white existing as cotton in its purest form.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493092198/ojdndmngbzayzquixbio.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>HRH King Hussein of Jordan donning the shamagh in a desert patrol uniform.</i></p>
<p>As other civilizations and countries formed, the colors of the <i>shamagh</i> grew to incorporate black, now known as the Palestinian <i>kuffiyah</i>, or solid white, which is more popular in the Gulf.</p>
<p>The light cotton and wool material of the <i>shamagh</i> allow it to be worn in any climate or season.  It is light enough to wear in the summer, yet serves as a warm covering in the winter.  It can be worn as a simple neck scarf, or tied around the crown of the head for sun coverage, or even around the shoulders.</p>

<p><br/><strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.6808578006457537"">MISSION</strong></p>
<p>Our mission is to allow anyone with a creative mind to express themselves artistically on their clothing while sharing their art with children of less fortune. The impact art has on a childs life is priceless. We want to help children by giving them high quality t shirts as well as expose them to beautiful art that will inspire their own creativity and artistic expression. </p>
<p><strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.6808578006457537"">OUR INSPIRATION</strong></p>
<p>Our current screen printing startup, VeerOut Screen Printing, based out of Santa Barbara, CA, has been greatly expanding in recent months. We now see an opportunity to start giving back to the marginalized communities that often get forgotten about by businesses such as ourselves that serve those who can afford our servcies.<br/><br/>The idea for the VeerOut Project started because people kept asking us to just make just ONE shirt for them with their original designs. We were unable to do so because our screen printing equipment takes too much time to set up, and costs too much for the consumer in the end. We decided that we needed to get a DIGITAL garment printer so we could just make one shirt any time that someone asked us to do so. Our team quickly realized that the opportunity to create individual customized tshirts for our clients at a relatively low cost also presents another, more phillanthropic opportunity to provide a child in need with a BRAND NEW TSHIRT for every order we recieve from our clients. We recognize that there are many foundations in the US dedicated to prividing children and their families with used, hand-me-down garments. A brand new shirt, however, is something that is not commonly received by these children. It is our goal to not only provide a child with a new shirt-- but to give them a gift that will provide them with a sense of pride and excitement--something hand-me-downs cannot provide. The founders of VeerOut were moved by the One-for-One vision and decided to separate this piece of the business into its own project and allow artists to express themselves through philanthropy.</p>

We now see an opportunity to start giving back to the marginalized communities that often get forgotten about by businesses such as ourselves that serve those who can afford our servcies.The idea for the VeerOut Project started because people kept asking us to just make just ONE shirt for them with their original designs. We were unable to do so because our screen printing equipment takes too much time to set up, and costs too much for the consumer in the end. We decided that we needed to get a DIGITAL garment printer so we could just make one shirt any time that someone asked us to do so. Our team quickly realized that the opportunity to create individual customized tshirts for our clients at a relatively low cost also presents another, more phillanthropic opportunity to provide a child in need with a BRAND NEW TSHIRT for every order we recieve from our clients. We recognize that there are many foundations in the US dedicated to prividing children and their families with used, hand-me-down garments. A brand new shirt, however, is something that is not commonly received by these children. It is our goal to not only provide a child with a new shirt-- but to give them a gift that will provide them with a sense of pride and excitement--something hand-me-downs cannot provide. The founders of VeerOut were moved by the One-for-One vision and decided to separate this piece of the business into its own project and allow artists to express themselves through philanthropy.
HELPING THE LESS FORTUNATE

Our entire business revolves around promoting growth in our communities. We decided to start by helping American families first.

According to the US Census Bureau:

US Population: 311,591,917 
Approx. 13.7 million single parents
Responsible for raising 26% of all children




27% of single mothers and their children live in poverty
13% of single fathers and their children live in poverty
Impoverished households rely heavily on medicaid, foodstamps, public housing, rent subsidies and other types of aid.

TO BUILD A COMMUNITY. ONE CLICK. TWO SMILES.

For each t shirts that you purchase, we are donating one identical t shirt to those in need. We chose the buy one, give one model because it makes an immediate and tangible difference in the lives of those in need.

ORIGINAL DESIGNS ONLY?
Yes! We cannot print copyrighted material so we need consumers to upload original art (graphics, fonts, etc).

Let your imagination run wild!
 
 
THE IMPACT
As founders of the VeerOut Project, we are proud to bring together our diverse backgrounds to promote growth in our communities. We want to share original art with families across America to alleviate the stress they ususally face when buying new clothes.Please watch our video so you can get a full picture of what we are doing and why.
PLEASE HELP US BRING THIS PROJECT TO LIFE!
If you are unable to donate you can still help us reach our goal by sharing our cause with your family and friends!

<p><strong>My Background:</strong></p>
<p>Although born in West Covina, California, we moved to Bloomington, Indiana when I was eight where I completed school and attended Indiana University.  After serving in the United States Marine Corps, my deployment to Iraq came to an end in 2005 and I returned home as a disabled veteran.  In 2006, realizing my Infantry skills would not be adaptable to the civilian world I had to make a switch in professions.  Fortunately, I had been in a small, specialized unit that used equipment called an MSIDS (MAGTF Secondary Imagery Dissemination System).  This equipment enabled our unit to take surveillance from photos and rapidly get the intelligence back to the Battalion Commander.  The <em>Panasonic Toughbook</em> we used had a program of “layering” photographs to allow for additional messages for intel within the pictures.  This set me up perfectly to learn <em>Adobe Photoshop</em> and move into web design and later programming.   From websites to even Native Mobile Apps I have published in the <em>Apple</em> ‘App Store’, I have developed a strong base in web and mobile technologies. </p>
<p>In 2008, I made the move to the promotional products industry as I found I could serve my clients better in the promotions of their websites via offline advertising and marketing campaigns.  This gave me the opportunity to do training in various promotional product productions from silk screening to even Pad Printing. </p>
<p>This past year I began learning the art of ‘Direct to Garment’ printing which is what this project is focused on!</p>
<p><strong>Industry Background</strong></p>
<p>Currently, the most cost effective way of getting custom t-shirts are done via silk screening.  Silk screening has many limitations though, such as the time it takes to set up each screen for each color used.  Printing a photograph to a t-shirt is just not possible with silk screening because of the large amount of colors used.   My focus is on the Direct to Garment (DTG) printer systems. The best way to describe these printers is by imagining a t-shirt as a piece of paper printing through a color printer.  Essentially you can print whatever is on your computer screen to a t-shirt within a couple minutes!</p>
<p><strong>The Project</strong></p>
<p>This project you are viewing now is focusing on one key part of the business.  The goal is to develop mobile t-shirt shops.  Mobile t-shirts shops with the capability of instant printing would be a great way to add a new user experience to buying t-shirts at a fair, festival, concert or even sports game!  Even fundraisers can benefit from this system.  Imagine a fundraiser that raises money for something like breast cancer research.  The fundraiser hires us to handle all t-shirt sales.  The public can choose which design they like best for their t-shirt but even customize it with something as specific as a person’s name the purchaser knew who passed away or wishes to honor from breast cancer - or even a photo!  </p>
<p>The actual business model is very simple and great for NPO’s and small business, but even better for clubs or music bands.  Essentially, we come out for a minimum (20 shirts roughly) and sell the shirts for you.  We have a set price for you and a set price for the public, which is where your profits originate from the difference.  At the end of the event we give you a check for your end of the profits!  No more buying or stocking 500 shirts, or more, for events and having too many shirts left over digging into your profits!</p>
<p><strong>What we need</strong></p>
<p>We are seeking at least $15,000 to complete the full development of our mobile t-shirt shop system.  We still need to focus on some programming components to ensure easy use of the system as well as the need for additional products and inventory.  Products we need now are some key components to our current printer, but hopefully we will be able to purchase another printer for back-up purposes in case one printer ever goes down for maintenance.  We also need a hydraulic cart system to move the printer easily from vehicles to any location we need to be - no matter if it’s indoors or outdoors!</p>
<p> <strong>How can you help and BENEFIT!</strong></p>
<p>The benefit to everyone who helps us in this project is that we want to HELP YOU with your <em>IndieGoGo</em> project!  The more you donate to us, the more we can benefit you in your donations for your project by providing promotional products to give out to your donors!  This is in the form of our <em>IndieGoGo</em> Promo Pack.   No matter if you want the Promo Pack for your start-up or if you already have a business, organization or even a band and need promos, you can get them here while helping us build and engineer our mobile custom t-shirt shop!</p></div>","Hi my name is Justin and I want to introduce you to my new project that creates a whole new experience to improve the custom t-shirt industry.  My goal is to see the custom t-shirt industry with a more efficient system that produces high quality customized products with faster turn-around times.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>    Hi everyone! My name is Leah ""Vynarius"" Tatley and this is my first campaign. I've always been passionate about art and felt this was a great way to channel that passion into something tangible with the added bonus of supporting a cause that I care for.</p>
<p>    This campaign is to raise funds for the first batch of T-shirts I wish to print. This campaign also has the added bonus of having a portion donated to the Loggerhead Marinelife Center, a local Florida charity in West Palm Beach. (Amount detailed in the pledges.)</p>
<p>    By supporting my campaign you help an aspiring artist who wishes to have her artwork be beautiful and meaningful. A goal of mine is to create designs that will be liked by many while also having some connection to a cause. I feel it is important to give back where and when you can.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>    The goal is $500 (the minimum you can set) and this money will first be going towards covering the cost of the printing of the first batch of T-shirts (aiming for 40 T-shirts min.) and image prints and the proper amount to be sent to Loggerhead Marine Center based on the pledges. Any remaining amount will be used towards the next T-shirt design printing cost.</p>
<p>    By pledging your funds there are a plethora of perks available, each detailed on the side, with a wide range of amounts to best accommodate those who wish to help!</p>
<p>    (The T-shirt will be the background color of the above image[Kiwi Green], and the dark green color will be the printed color upon the T-shirt.)</p>
<p>   If I don't reach my entire goal the funds will go towards printing as many of the ""Save the Sea Turtles"" T-shirts and prints as possible.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>    This will be the first step towards having my own line of T-shirts in which I can offer, and continue to be able to offer future designs to grow. Not only are you helping an aspiring artist, but you are helping the conservation of sea turtles, which all species occuring in US waters are classified as threatened or endangered.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>    If you can't contribute, that's okay, you can still help! Please, spread the word to your friends and family. Remember there are many tools that Indiegogo has provided to help aid in this, such as the share tools! Thank you for your time and consideration!</p>

<p>Gary Noel is a lovable, hardworking American farmer who is also a pilot, flying a crop duster. He was in middle of work flying his crop duster plane and suddenly his plane dipped out of control, hit a power line and crashed upside down. Gary was in excruciating pain from the severe injuries and couldn’t move. Several bones in his body were crushed from the impact including a huge gash in his head that was bleeding and needed immediate attention. A young college nursing student saw the plane crash and rushed to the site with a few people following her vehicle.  The brave young lady, Kristyn Abshire, single handedly rescued Gary Noel in spite of the bystanders yelling at her not to go near the plane as the fuel was leaking all over and the plane was smoking. Kristyn covered Gary’s bleeding head wound until the emergency rescue team arrived which saved Gary’s life.</p>
<p>We want to raise a total of $100,000 with $80,000 going to Gary Noel to help recover from the plane crash and also give a $20,000 Nursing College scholarship award for Kristyn Abshire for saving Gary’s life.</p>
<p>Gary Noel is currently in a critical condition and going through several painful surgeries to recover from the body damage he sustained from the plane crash. Gary requires our support to get him back on his feet and help his family who depends on him to cope with the expensive medical needs from the accident. As a hardworking American farmer living in Vermilion Parish, Louisiana, Gary has earned an honest living, took care of his family, been charitable all his life, paid taxes on his earnings and contributed to the economy.  This is the most difficult time in Gary’s life and he deserves our support. Please help contribute to Gary Noel and his loving family to get through this difficult time in their life.</p>

<h3>Glorious Resurrection of an Extinct Animal- On a T-Shirt!</h3>
<p>Hello all! My name is Ryan, and I am an artist/illustrator/designer. I run a t-shirt and apparel company called Donkeyshines which specializes in absurd animal designs. Recently, I created an illustration of a flaming dodo bird which I call the Dodo Phoenix. It symbolizes the resurrection of a misunderstood animal that everyone assumed was too dumb to survive. With your help, I'd like to put this majestic creature on a t-shirt and share it with the world!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>I've estimated that this project will cost $1750, which includes Indiegogo processing fees, costs of perks, and of course the printing of the shirt itself. This is for the 3-color Dodo Phoenix design on the front and the 1-color Donkeyshines logo on the right sleeve. I'm looking to do a run of 101 shirts on the very best blanks I can afford. Shirt quality is important to me, and if I fall short of my goal, I will print fewer shirts before I make compromises with the fabric.</p>
<h3>What Happens If I Fall Short of My Goal?</h3>
<p>Taking care of the perks will be my first priority if my goal is not met. Since the Dodo Phoenix shirt itself will be offered as one of the perks, that means there will be at least SOME shirts printed as long as at least one person makes a contribution for that perk. My ultimate goal is to share my art, and all of the perks offered will be examples of my work. In that sense, this project can't fail as long as at least one person makes a contribution for one perk (even if it's not for the shirt and I don't end up printing any).</p>
<p>Of course, getting the entire $1750 would be nice, too...</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p><strong>$5-</strong> Contributions of this amount will get you a piece of hand-drawn original art! What will I draw for you? Whatever pops into my head as I hold my pen over an 8"" x 10"" piece of paper and listen to Berlioz's <em>Symphonie Fantastique</em> or Prokoviev's <em>Semyon Kotko</em>. The drawing is likely to feature a weird monster or alien or something. Example:</p>

<p>In addition to 1 each of the above postcards, you'll get 3 Robot Penguin stickers:</p>

<p><strong>$15-</strong> Contributions of this amount will get you the <strong>Dodo Phoenix shirt</strong>! It quite possibly will look something like this:</p>

<p>This shirt will eventually retail for $19.99 at Donkeyshines, so you can save $5 by getting it as a perk for a donation! Think of it as a discounted pre-order.</p>

</div></div>","Glorious Resurrection of an Extinct Animal- On a T-Shirt!
Hello all! My name is Ryan, and I am an artist/illustrator/designer. I run a t-shirt and apparel company called Donkeyshines which specializes in absurd animal designs. Recently, I created an illustration of a flaming dodo bird which I call the Dodo Phoenix. It symbolizes the resurrection of a misunderstood animal that everyone assumed was too dumb to survive. With your help, I'd like to put this majestic creature on a t-shirt and share it with the world!


What I Need
I've estimated that this project will cost $1750, which includes Indiegogo processing fees, costs of perks, and of course the printing of the shirt itself. This is for the 3-color Dodo Phoenix design on the front and the 1-color Donkeyshines logo on the right sleeve. I'm looking to do a run of 101 shirts on the very best blanks I can afford. Shirt quality is important to me, and if I fall short of my goal, I will print fewer shirts before I make compromises with the fabric.
What Happens If I Fall Short of My Goal?
Taking care of the perks will be my first priority if my goal is not met. Since the Dodo Phoenix shirt itself will be offered as one of the perks, that means there will be at least SOME shirts printed as long as at least one person makes a contribution for that perk. My ultimate goal is to share my art, and all of the perks offered will be examples of my work. In that sense, this project can't fail as long as at least one person makes a contribution for one perk (even if it's not for the shirt and I don't end up printing any).
Of course, getting the entire $1750 would be nice, too...


The Perks
$5- Contributions of this amount will get you a piece of hand-drawn original art! What will I draw for you? Whatever pops into my head as I hold my pen over an 8"" x 10"" piece of paper and listen to Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique or Prokoviev's Semyon Kotko. The drawing is likely to feature a weird monster or alien or something. Example:

See more examples of the kind of drawing you'll get.
$10- Contributions of this amount will get you a pack of stickers and postcards from Donkeyshines. The postcards are prints of 3 digital paintings I've done (Interplanetary Adoption, A Day in the Park, and Gorilla Chef):

In addition to 1 each of the above postcards, you'll get 3 Robot Penguin stickers:

$15- Contributions of this amount will get you the Dodo Phoenix shirt! It quite possibly will look something like this:

This shirt will eventually retail for $19.99 at Donkeyshines, so you can save $5 by getting it as a perk for a donation! Think of it as a discounted pre-order.
$20- Contributions of this amount will get you any Donkeyshines T-shirt I currently have in stock. Here are some examples of my other designs:

<h3>**I WILL ASK YOU YOUR SIZE ONCE THE CAMPAIGN IS OVER SO NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THIS!**</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Help me repropose to my wife!</h3>
This past weekend, my wife, Annie Cline, lost her wedding ring in Indianapolis.  We looked all weekend for it and never found it.  She is deeply saddened that she will never have the ring that I proposed to her with as well as the wedding band she received on our big day.  While I know I will never be able to replace that special keepsake, I am wanting to replace it with a new wedding ring.  I plan to propose to her again and have a small renwal of our vows if you will.</div>
<div>
<h3>How am I going to buy the new ring?</h3>
In order to buy the new ring, I need to raise funds in order to buy it.  I have been kicking around several ideas on how to do this, and the most logical way is for me to make and sell shirts.  The shirt is entitled ""Bring the Ring"" and is printed on a super-soft Tultex fashion fit heather shirt.  The vintage design has our initials in the center of the ring along with the year we got married.  The shirts are available in mens and womens sizes (heather grey is men's only.)  All the shirts are $18 and include shipping.</div>

<div><img alt=""Bring the Ring shirts"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.mycustombandmerch.com/shirtmocks.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Bring the Ring Shirts""/></div>
<div>
<h3>What it will mean to Annie and I</h3>
<p>While there are not many material things that the two of us care about, this is the one thing that both of us are truly saddened that we will never have again.  There are so many memories of the ring.  Saving for it, proposing to Annie, the day we got married, the joys and trials of the first 7 years of our marriage.  I know how emotionally drained Annie is from losing it and I want to see her happy.  It would mean so much to both of us to have family and friends involved in this renewing of our marriage.  By purchasing a shirt, you are helping me raise the needed funds to buy that special item that will signify our undying love for each other.  Thank you!</p>

<h3>Our story</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The Scuro bronzo is a custom designed bronze pilot/dive watch, every part has been designed and build's on the brand's commitment to produce robust and well-designed timepieces that are both versatile and afordable. Like the dive watches that came before, SCURO kept things simple with a strong focus on reliability, which of course, is one of the most important qualities in a watch meant to serve both pilots and divers. With features like a bronze Super Compressor-style case and vibrant dial colors, the SCURO Bronzo also aims to offer tool watch lovers something a little different.</p>

<p>If it wasn't apparent in the Model S dive watches, it should be evident that SCURO prefers to use the best materials available in the development of  watches. In the case of the SCURO Bronzo, that material is CuSn8, a marine-grade bronze alloy that is known to patina nicely with age. This is also a more versatile case material than most people might think and the SCURO Bronzo is equally at home in both casual and formal settings. Whatever situation you find yourself in, it should also be noted that like all SCURO timepieces, it is backed by a one-year warranty.</p>

<p>For the movement, SCURO bronzo chose the venerable Miyota 9015. At just 3.90mm in height, the movement allowed for the relatively slim case profile and also provides reliable timekeeping. It offers both hacking and hand-winding and operates at 28,800 bph for a smooth, sweeping effect. One thing to note is that it also boasts a 42-hour power reserve and supports the discreet date function located at 6 o'clock on the Bronzo's dial.</p>

</div></div>","Our story
 
The Scuro bronzo is a custom designed bronze pilot/dive watch, every part has been designed and build's on the brand's commitment to produce robust and well-designed timepieces that are both versatile and afordable. Like the dive watches that came before, SCURO kept things simple with a strong focus on reliability, which of course, is one of the most important qualities in a watch meant to serve both pilots and divers. With features like a bronze Super Compressor-style case and vibrant dial colors, the SCURO Bronzo also aims to offer tool watch lovers something a little different.

Double domed sapphire crystal with AR coating​
If it wasn't apparent in the Model S dive watches, it should be evident that SCURO prefers to use the best materials available in the development of  watches. In the case of the SCURO Bronzo, that material is CuSn8, a marine-grade bronze alloy that is known to patina nicely with age. This is also a more versatile case material than most people might think and the SCURO Bronzo is equally at home in both casual and formal settings. Whatever situation you find yourself in, it should also be noted that like all SCURO timepieces, it is backed by a one-year warranty.

<p>Reuben and I started living a more eco-lifestyle around 4 years ago and since then we have made an effort to be sustainable and conscious in our buying decisions. The one area where this became a challenge was everyday clothing, like t-shirts. We were shocked at how expensive these everyday items were - with words like organic and eco being used as marketing fodder to hike up prices and segregate buyers - but that’s totally against the nature of sustainability - so we said “rhino balls to that” and started Jungle Snail.</p>
<p>Jungle Snail is a little clothing company that wants to make a big difference. We want to supply simple, quality eco-clothing for everyday living at down-to-earth prices. We also want to start this business off on a sustainable footing and give back from the first t-shirts sold - instead of as part of a PR campaign or tax-break like high street retailers. That means aligning with charities and awesome causes to share the eco love - you buy the t-shirts and the worlds eco-warriors get a helping hand.</p>
<p>Jungle Snail wants to challenge the high street and bring sustainable eco-clothing to everyone - why should you pay a small fortune for a simple organic cotton t-shirt just because it’s a trendy thing? That’s just massive elephant-poo. You know what we do with massive elephant-poo - we get it in paper-form and print on it!</p>
<p>So, elephant-poo aside, we need your support in getting our venture off the ground. Your donations to our startup fund will ensure that we can get the ‘Mother Snail’ launched in exactly the way we want to operate it - by giving a little wherever we can. We also want to ensure that we’re a sustainable company from the ground-up - from our clothing materials, the printing we use, the packaging, the labels, even the food we feed our sausage dog ‘Noodle’.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your support in helping us make this a reality!</p>

<p>(adjective) become much greater in intensity or size or amount.  </p>
<p>Rewondered is expanding, offering new product lines and custom order services.  I am very excited about all the new products I will be introducing over the course of this campaign, and in the future.  Funds raised will support purchasing more supplies to make more samples and products for sale, as well as to make the items claimed through the rewards offered here, and for packaging, listing fees, and other costs associated with making and selling my products.  </p>
<p>I will be listing five new items in <a href=""http://rewondered.etsy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">my Etsy shop</a> for each day for 50 days (my Five X Fifty promotion, see the updates tab for links to my blog posts), so I am redoubling my efforts to raise funds, create new products, and get them available to my customers.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 12/11/12</strong>: I now have the ability to view City of Heroes .costume files, so I'm adding a special perk.  For $100 I will use a .costume file you send me as a prototype, and send you the finished pieces so you can cosplay your character!  Alternately, if you don't want to/can't cosplay your own character, I will make a female costume of your choice for myself to cosplay and do a photo shoot, sending you autographed copies of at least five photos.  Please send your .costume file to <a href=""mailto:rewondered@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">rewondered@gmail.com</a></p>
<p>Caveats:  I will not cosplay any costume that shows more skin than it covers.  No Eden tops, sorry!  I may not be able to make every piece available in the costume creator, so your costume may not be complete if any pieces are too hard for me to make or require skills I don't have (i.e. I can sew, I can't weld).  This project may take me several months, and I will start with the easier costumes first.  I will keep you appraised of my progress on your costume pieces and do my best to recreate it in its entirety, but I cannot guarantee that I will be able to make every piece, nor when I will have it done.  Also, shipping your costume to you will be extra, and I will arrange that with you once the costume is completed.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 12/01/12</strong>:  With the sunsetting of <a href=""http://www.cityofheroes.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">City of Heroes</a> and my acceptance as a merchant for <a href=""http://www.birka.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Birka</a>, I will be redirecting my focus and funding on two main new products (though I'll still be completing the Five X Fifty posts I'm behind on. I have items made, I just need to get them posted!). </p>
<p>One, I will be attempting to recreate City of Heroes costume pieces ""in real life"" particularly those ""classic"" pieces that so many people used and those from some of the fun newer costume packs like the Steampunk and Gunslinger ones.  If you played City of Heroes, please send your screenshots of your favorite costumes to rewondered@gmail.com</p>
<p>Two, I will be working on a line of Practically Period jewelry, garb, and accessories for SCA enthusiasts, particularly a line of mix and match reversible pieces that can be used to create several looks from just a handful of pieces.  For example, a pair of tie-on sleeves, an overdress/vest/apron, a lace-up bodice/corselet, and a belt/sash could be combined in several different ways on top of a basic chemise/dress.  I also want to work on Rewondered Garb, remaking modern clothing to look more period.</p>
<p>If you are going to be at <a href=""http://www.birka.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Birka</a>, you can spend your gift certificate and/or pick out your free item there!</p>
<p>For more information about redeeming your perks, please <a href=""http://rewondered.wordpress.com/2012/11/16/regarding-rewondered-redoubled-rewards/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">read this</a>.</p>

<h3 style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>Rewondered – What is Rewondered?</strong></h3>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><a href=""http://www.rewondered.com"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Rewondered</a> is a one-woman handmade fashion business specializing in items for anyone who wants to express their style in a distinctive and unconventional fashion.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">When I decided to start my own business, I wanted it to express my creativity, as well as do some small part to save the world (I'm not a superhero in real life, but I play one online). I started designing jewelry using a variety of new and used materials, old broken pieces, found objects, leftover craft supplies, and anything else I thought was interesting. I try to reuse and recycle as much as possible, thus keeping perfectly good objects out of the landfills. I love taking something that could be considered “junk” and “rewondering” it into something... well, wonderful.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">I have been planning to expand my product lines for some time, but Rewondered took a bit of a back seat when I relocated to New Hampshire in August of 2011, and when I got married in August of 2012. However, I have since been busy in the studio and I'm ready to start reinvigorating my business.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Here are just a few of the new products I'm working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Period “Replica” Jewelry – Designs based on portraits and artwork from the Middle Ages and Renaissance.</li>
<li>Basic garb – T-tunics, chemises, simple dresses, etc.</li>
<li>“Upcycled” garb – Modern clothing “rewondered” to look more period.</li>
<li>Garb “Accessories” – Sleeves that tie on, aprons, tabards, headdresses, hats, belts and sashes, pouches, corsets, etc.</li>
<li>Steampunk “Accessories” – Bustles and overskirts, corset tops, top hats, bags and purses, belts and harnesses, spats, cuffs, etc.</li>
<li>Costume and cosplay pieces – I’d love to try some recreations of costume pieces that are available in City of Heroes, and I have several other costume patterns I need to play with.</li>
<li>Hair accessories – Barrettes, headbands, hair sticks, elastics, and various headpieces.</li>
<li>More bags – I have a bunch of different patterns and a few other ideas floating around in my head.</li>
<li>Skirts – I’m working on a few of my own design, and I have several patterns.</li>
<li>Wondiosyncra-Tees – Upcycled t-shirts featuring descriptive words.</li>
<li>“Feminized” t-shirts – I’ve seen several nifty ideas for taking a regular t-shirt and making it more fitted and more feminine.</li>
<li>More “rewondered” clothing and costume pieces</li>
<li>More embellished hoodies</li>
<li>More pillows</li>
<li>More wall art – Word art designs using quotes, collages and mixed media, signs, etc.</li>
<li>Adding matching earrings and/or bracelets to some of my current designs</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<div>
<h3>Rewards Redoubled</h3>
Each reward level is actually a double reward.  You get to choose one item in that price range, plus you'll get a gift certificate to Rewondered in the amount of your contribution.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For a $50 contribution, your reward is re-redoubled, and you'll get a gift certificate worth $210!  I am limiting this reward to 210 people.  Why 210?  Because 2/10 is my birthday so I have a special affinity for that number. :)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If I raise DOUBLE my goal (i.e. $2000), all rewards will double!  So you'll get two products in that price range plus twice your contribution as a gift certificate.  And the $50 contributions will get $420 gift certificates!  And yes, the $100 contributions would be able to pick two costumes.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>AND if all 210 of the $50 rewards are claimed, I'll multiply ALL rewards by 5!  So you'd get 5 items and 5 times your contribution as a gift certificate, or a $1050 gift certificate for a $50 contribution, or five costumes.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Rewondered gift certificates do not expire and don't need to be spent all at once, as I will keep track of any balance left.  Most of my prices end in 95 cents, so for the purposes of the price ranges here, all items will be rounded up to the next dollar (i.e. an item priced at $9.95 is a $10 item).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">One great way to help is to spread the word about my campaign to everyone you know through Facebook, Twitter, email, or however else you want to communicate. </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Another is to contribute your unwanted jewelry, craft and sewing supplies, fabric, trims and embellishments, clothing, wedding and prom dresses, costume pieces, curtains, blankets, home decorations, and any other items you think might be useful to me. I don't care if it's broken, ripped, or out of style! Do you have a 10x10 canopy you're not using? Something that will make a good display piece? Adjustable dress forms, portable washing machine, sewing machine, or other equipment? If you live within a 2-3 hours drive of Hillsborough, NH I can arrange to pick things up. Otherwise, talk to me about arrangements for shipping.</p>

</div></div>","Redoubled:
(adjective) become much greater in intensity or size or amount.  
Rewondered is expanding, offering new product lines and custom order services.  I am very excited about all the new products I will be introducing over the course of this campaign, and in the future.  Funds raised will support purchasing more supplies to make more samples and products for sale, as well as to make the items claimed through the rewards offered here, and for packaging, listing fees, and other costs associated with making and selling my products.  
I will be listing five new items in my Etsy shop for each day for 50 days (my Five X Fifty promotion, see the updates tab for links to my blog posts), so I am redoubling my efforts to raise funds, create new products, and get them available to my customers.
UPDATE 12/11/12: I now have the ability to view City of Heroes .costume files, so I'm adding a special perk.  For $100 I will use a .costume file you send me as a prototype, and send you the finished pieces so you can cosplay your character!  Alternately, if you don't want to/can't cosplay your own character, I will make a female costume of your choice for myself to cosplay and do a photo shoot, sending you autographed copies of at least five photos.  Please send your .costume file to rewondered@gmail.com
Caveats:  I will not cosplay any costume that shows more skin than it covers.  No Eden tops, sorry!  I may not be able to make every piece available in the costume creator, so your costume may not be complete if any pieces are too hard for me to make or require skills I don't have (i.e. I can sew, I can't weld).  This project may take me several months, and I will start with the easier costumes first.  I will keep you appraised of my progress on your costume pieces and do my best to recreate it in its entirety, but I cannot guarantee that I will be able to make every piece, nor when I will have it done.  Also, shipping your costume to you will be extra, and I will arrange that with you once the costume is completed.
UPDATE 12/01/12:  With the sunsetting of City of Heroes and my acceptance as a merchant for Birka, I will be redirecting my focus and funding on two main new products (though I'll still be completing the Five X Fifty posts I'm behind on. I have items made, I just need to get them posted!). 
One, I will be attempting to recreate City of Heroes costume pieces ""in real life"" particularly those ""classic"" pieces that so many people used and those from some of the fun newer costume packs like the Steampunk and Gunslinger ones.  If you played City of Heroes, please send your screenshots of your favorite costumes to rewondered@gmail.com
Two, I will be working on a line of Practically Period jewelry, garb, and accessories for SCA enthusiasts, particularly a line of mix and match reversible pieces that can be used to create several looks from just a handful of pieces.  For example, a pair of tie-on sleeves, an overdress/vest/apron, a lace-up bodice/corselet, and a belt/sash could be combined in several different ways on top of a basic chemise/dress.  I also want to work on Rewondered Garb, remaking modern clothing to look more period.
If you are going to be at Birka, you can spend your gift certificate and/or pick out your free item there!
For more information about redeeming your perks, please read this.
 
Rewondered – What is Rewondered?
Rewondered is a one-woman handmade fashion business specializing in items for anyone who wants to express their style in a distinctive and unconventional fashion.
When I decided to start my own business, I wanted it to express my creativity, as well as do some small part to save the world (I'm not a superhero in real life, but I play one online). I started designing jewelry using a variety of new and used materials, old broken pieces, found objects, leftover craft supplies, and anything else I thought was interesting. I try to reuse and recycle as much as possible, thus keeping perfectly good objects out of the landfills. I love taking something that could be considered “junk” and “rewondering” it into something... well, wonderful.
I have been planning to expand my product lines for some time, but Rewondered took a bit of a back seat when I relocated to New Hampshire in August of 2011, and when I got married in August of 2012. However, I have since been busy in the studio and I'm ready to start reinvigorating my business.
Here are just a few of the new products I'm working on:

Period “Replica” Jewelry – Designs based on portraits and artwork from the Middle Ages and Renaissance.
Basic garb – T-tunics, chemises, simple dresses, etc.
“Upcycled” garb – Modern clothing “rewondered” to look more period.
Garb “Accessories” – Sleeves that tie on, aprons, tabards, headdresses, hats, belts and sashes, pouches, corsets, etc.
Steampunk “Accessories” – Bustles and overskirts, corset tops, top hats, bags and purses, belts and harnesses, spats, cuffs, etc.
Costume and cosplay pieces – I’d love to try some recreations of costume pieces that are available in City of Heroes, and I have several other costume patterns I need to play with.
Hair accessories – Barrettes, headbands, hair sticks, elastics, and various headpieces.
More bags – I have a bunch of different patterns and a few other ideas floating around in my head.
Skirts – I’m working on a few of my own design, and I have several patterns.
Wondiosyncra-Tees – Upcycled t-shirts featuring descriptive words.
“Feminized” t-shirts – I’ve seen several nifty ideas for taking a regular t-shirt and making it more fitted and more feminine.
More “rewondered” clothing and costume pieces
More embellished hoodies
More pillows
More wall art – Word art designs using quotes, collages and mixed media, signs, etc.
Adding matching earrings and/or bracelets to some of my current designs
 

Rewards Redoubled
Each reward level is actually a double reward.  You get to choose one item in that price range, plus you'll get a gift certificate to Rewondered in the amount of your contribution.
 
For a $50 contribution, your reward is re-redoubled, and you'll get a gift certificate worth $210!  I am limiting this reward to 210 people.  Why 210?  Because 2/10 is my birthday so I have a special affinity for that number. :)
 
If I raise DOUBLE my goal (i.e. $2000), all rewards will double!  So you'll get two products in that price range plus twice your contribution as a gift certificate.  And the $50 contributions will get $420 gift certificates!  And yes, the $100 contributions would be able to pick two costumes.
 
AND if all 210 of the $50 rewards are claimed, I'll multiply ALL rewards by 5!  So you'd get 5 items and 5 times your contribution as a gift certificate, or a $1050 gift certificate for a $50 contribution, or five costumes.
 
Rewondered gift certificates do not expire and don't need to be spent all at once, as I will keep track of any balance left.  Most of my prices end in 95 cents, so for the purposes of the price ranges here, all items will be rounded up to the next dollar (i.e. an item priced at $9.95 is a $10 item).
 

Other Ways You Can Help
One great way to help is to spread the word about my campaign to everyone you know through Facebook, Twitter, email, or however else you want to communicate. 
Another is to contribute your unwanted jewelry, craft and sewing supplies, fabric, trims and embellishments, clothing, wedding and prom dresses, costume pieces, curtains, blankets, home decorations, and any other items you think might be useful to me. I don't care if it's broken, ripped, or out of style! Do you have a 10x10 canopy you're not using? Something that will make a good display piece? Adjustable dress forms, portable washing machine, sewing machine, or other equipment? If you live within a 2-3 hours drive of Hillsborough, NH I can arrange to pick things up. Otherwise, talk to me about arrangements for shipping.

<p>I'm Ed, the guy sitting on the tree in the picture below.  I am a 43 year old father of 2 young daughters, a pretty decent husband, a business owner, and an entrepreneur. I love the outdoors and years ago developed a prototype for a ski/snow sock, but did not pursue developing a business to sell them. <br/></p>

<p>While thinking over the past year about my next business venture, two things happened--I decided that I wanted my next venture to have social value and, many of the people to whom I had given my sock prototype told me that it was their favorite ski sock and wanted more.  It was my ""Reese's moment"" and the Lift 23 concept was born.  </p>

</div></div>","What is Lift 23?
Lift 23 is a premium ski/snow sock company with a social mission. 
Our product: 
The perfect ski/snowboard sock.  We have refined multiple prototypes over the past 5 years based on feedback from avid snow sport enthusiasts and now bring to you a sock with the optimal thickness and make up for achieving performance, comfort, and warmth. Made from the finest Merino wool, the Lift 23 sock is durable, form-fitting, and will keep your feet warm. 
UPDATE:
These socks are super comfy! I haven't gotten my new free ride boots in yet so I used my wicked stiff and tight race boots this weekend at A-Basin. The socks were quite thick for that style boot but they will certainly be optimal for my loose fit park and pow boots. All and all, these socks are killer and chicks dig them on campus! - Tanner Mottau (Former NCAA U of Colorado Ski Team member)

</div></div>","Short SummaryRaven Roberts. Freelance Wardrobe Stylist.I'm doing what I love and I need your help. I'm looking to take my business to the next level. I want to buy a mirror-less camera for better photo and video quality. Many of you may know that I take my outfit of the day pictures and post videos on YouTube. These social media strategies are helping me to brand myself. I'm looking to brand myself so that I may partner with brands and expand my styling to bigger clients and avenues. What I NeedI'm looking to get the Sony Nex-5T with the following accessories:
Tripod - To take photos and video seamlessly without having to commission someone to take them
SD Card - So that I can store photos on my camera
Case - to protect your investment
Warranty plan - to protect your investment
Wireless Remote - when using the tripod I can take the photos 
Extra Lens - almost free with bundle
Total - about $1200
Why the Sony Nex-5T (main reasons)
Small and Compact, for a mirror-less camera
Wi-fi capabilities to upload pictures straight to my phone 
Great video and photo quality
Video auto focus
Flip Screen

Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTjxBl1fOq0

The Difference
photo quality: my current quality vs a blogger with the Sony Nex 5T







video quality: mine vs another vlogger with the Sony Next 5T

<p><b>Education is important:</b></p>

My education through college was homeschooling
and then I got my GED at age 17, and though I have always wanted to be a designer
at that point I lacked direction and focus. It didn’t help that I had people in
my life who discouraged me from furthering my education. Then at the age of 24
I decided that I wanted to follow my dream of being a designer and started back
to school to cover the deficits in my <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">highschool education. After 3 years of general education
classes and a 3.7 GPA I moved closer to UC to go to school, and after 2 years
got accepted into the Fashion Design program at DAAP.</span>
<p><b>Why I need school to
design clothes:</b></p>
<p>Being homeschooled didn’t allow me the chance to take art
classes, and unfortunately it isn’t something that comes natural to me, but the
fact is drawing is an important part of the design process. I also never
learned to sew, also a fundamental part of designing clothes. So while I have
the passion, creativity and drive to follow my dreams, skills are something I
need to learn.</p>
<p><b>So I got in, now I
have to pay:</b></p>
<p>I have worked hard to get to the school I am in and I am
working hard to get the best grades and learn the best skills I can, but money
is an issue. I originally started school under the impression that I would be
able to get grants and loans, then I found out that there had been a problem
with the loans from my previous school that I would have to get worked out
before I could get that assistance, and at this point (especially with the
government shutdown) it doesn’t look like that will be sorted out in time for
me to register and attend classes next semester. I somehow have to come up with
the $15,000 to cover my bill for this semester before I can continue on, and
because this is a selective program and each semester is a set course if I miss
a semester it could be a couple years before I get the opportunity to start
classes again.</p>

It all started on a tranquil night when we could hear the watch ticking and feel our heart beating. Living in a fast-paced city, our heartbeat is easily forgotten. The ticking of a watch is muted by constant stimulation in a hectic world; where city lights outshine the stars. Sometimes we simply lose sight of the bright and beautiful things around us, the blue sky, blooming flowers, singing birds, smile of loved ones, and your breathe.We hope to create a brand that becomes a reminder of the small wonders in life. Tordney timepiece is our first project. It would be our pleasure to share the lessons learned as startup, as well as precious discoveries made along the way.The Design Dual - time represented by stick and numeric indices for a minimal design.Mono - hour, minute, second represented by stick indices to create a timeless design.When distractions are kept to minimal, we are more likely to discover the small wonders in life! Our design is based on this principle. Instead of creating a feature-packed timepiece, we focus on the details.

This is done by using soft, sleek, and waterproof fleece.    What Makes MINIM Special?Our garments are created for hikers, campers, snowboarders, and anyone who encounters the elements.We use the highest tech fleece in the world to craft pants and hoodies that are not only soft and flexible, but waterproof. The result is clothing that breaks the barriers between comfort and performance, creating gear that can be used whether you're trekking through the woods or relaxing on the couch.WARNING: Once you put these on, you may never take them off.  How We Do ItThe beauty of our technology is layering. Between our brush resistant face and crazy-soft lining lies a razor thin membrane. This membrane is engineered with micro-pore construction, blocking water from entering while simultaneously allowing restricted amounts of airflow to create breathability.We believe MINIM will transform the way you think about outerwear. We want you to feel inspired every time you get dressed in the morning.  The Problem In The Clothing Industry:As a result of fast fashion and over consumption, 80 billion clothing garments are bought each year. With consumers purchasing countless pieces in order to be ready for all situations, it's not wonder why the apparel industry has become the second most pollutant in the world, only behind oil.How We Can Help:People will always need clothes, but if we can own less by using garments that are useful in a multitude of situations, we'll be able to drastically cut back on the industry's negative effects on the world.

We can’t tell you where this pocket is located, because then it wouldn’t be a secret anymore. You’ll have to really look for it to find it when you receive your Sling.</p>

</div><br/></div>","Even though there are tons of bags on the market for “Everyday Carry” we didn’t feel there were any bags out there for “Everyday Adventure”. We wanted a bag that could hold all our modern day tech-essentials but also keep up with our active lifestyle. We wanted to create a bag that could be worn as comfortably skating down the boardwalk or riding your bike down massive hills as it could be walking to your local coffee shop.For most people with active lifestyles a backpack is the only option to carry your stuff. However when you're out all day at things like music festivals or hiking with friends, you necessarily don’t want to carry a massive backpack around as it becomes heavy after a few hours of use.We wanted to make a bag that was so comfortable it could be worn all day, something that had great functionality but also minimal weight and impact. We created the KP Sling Bag to be extremely form fitting, so much so you might even forget you’re wearing it.Sling Demo VideoWe sent a few prototypes to our favorite YouTube channels for them to review, and here is what they had to say about the KP Sling.Dimensions: 14""L x 8""W x 5""D (Inches) / 35L x 20W x 13D (CM)Weight: 12 oz / 0.34 kg 
Exterior: 1000D Cordura Nylon & High Quality Vegan Leather
Interior: Ripstop Nylon & Multi-Spandex
Seatbelt Grade Shoulder Strap
Zamak 5 Zinc Alloy Hardwares
3 Separate (Zippered) Storage Areas
8 Unique Compartments
Center Padded Area (Perfect for Handheld Electronics)
Secret Compartment – Passport Sized
Special Sunglasses Pouch
YKK Waterproof Zippers
100% Water Resistant
Vegan-Friendly
Optional Waist-Strap & Removable Shoulder Pad
Can be worn over left shoulder OR right shoulder
Debossed Minimalist Logo
How many USB flash drives have you lost? With the new KP Paracord USB bracelet, you can keep your projects and files right on your wrist. With 32GB of storage and a 10 foot paracord rope, it’s the ultimate survival bracelet for either getting that project to your client or out on adventures.
32GB USB Flash Drive
High Speed USB 2.0 Compatible
US Military Type III Grade Paracord
Minimum strength 550 lb (single paracord)
Unravel to 10 ft / 3 meters
Debossed Minimalist Logo





Custom KP black carabiner which you can attach to the hook plate of the KP Sling Bag. Perfect for your keys or pocket tools. It also has a built-in bottle opener and hex driver.
Dimensions: 2.75""H x 1.25""W (Inches) / 6.98H x 3.17W (CM)


Whether you're hanging upside down rock climbing or landing kickflips on your skateboard the optional waist strap keeps your KP Sling Bag in place making it the ultimate adventure bag!



The Secret Compartment
We've designed a passport sized secret compartment somewhere in the Sling to store your important belongings. This compartment is so hidden that it's virtually invisible. We can’t tell you where this pocket is located, because then it wouldn’t be a secret anymore. You’ll have to really look for it to find it when you receive your Sling.



Sling’s exterior fabric is treated with durable water repellent (DWR) finish, which makes Sling water-resistant and stain-resistant.

<h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>
<p>George, Jen, and Nazareth -- it's a pleasure meeting you :) We are passionate about raising our son in the Christian faith, and him knowing his Bible.</p>
<p>One night as we were dressing Nazareth for bed, he said ""imagine if my pajamas had David &amp; Goliath all over them, wouldn't that be cool?"". From that moment we knew we had to make it happen.</p>
<p>When we started Holy Pals, we wanted to design products that give children the opportunity to draw near to Christ, and to help parents teach their children about their faith. Another very important part of our mission is to shine a light on child-focused charities in need of support, raising awareness of their worthy causes and supporting them alongside our customers.</p>
<p>We are so excited to announce that we will be collaborating with The Littlest Lamb Orphanage, a privately funded orphanage in Egypt. They have built a home for orphaned and at-risk children who have lost parents to death, imprisonment, or abandonment. The Littlest Lamb provides these children with everything they need to thrive – shelter, food, clothing, education and most importantly A FAMILY that loves them. </p>
<p>The folks at The Littlest Lamb have inspired us so much with their mission, and we’re excited to support them with every pajama sale we make!</p>

<p>As of late I received a letter from Miss Teen Oakland
saying I was eligible to participate for a Beauty Pageant Audition. I was very
surprised as to how I got this letter but I tried it out anyways bringing my
sister along for fun. We both auditioned and the following week we both got our
acceptance letter congratulating us on getting passed auditions. This was now
something we had to take a little bit more seriously. After finding out we got
in the pageant we had to also raise sponsors. We had to somehow achieve $1,000
for the both of us. Though this sponsor money covers everything that we will
need for this pageant.</p>
<p>My sister and I
will be competing, for our share of thousands of dollars in prizes and
specialty gifts that will be distributed to contestants. We will be competing
in the Miss Teen ivision, one of four divisions that will have young
ladies ages of 7 and 19 competing in modeling routines, which include casual
wear and formal wear. Most important, we will display our personalities and
interviewing skills while interviewing with this year's Oakland/San
Jose judging panel. Personality is the number one aspect that each
contestant is judged on during all phases of competition.<br/>
<br/>
If we were to win the title of Miss Teen Oakland/San Jose, she would
represent Oakland/San Jose<span><span> and the surrounding communities at
the National Competition that will take place in Orlando, Florida. Over
$30,000.00 in prizes and awards will be presented at the National Competition
while each winner enjoys this expense paid trip of five nights and six days in
Orlando, Florida.<br/>
<br/>
Community businesses, organizations, and private individuals will assist us in
participating in this year's competition by becoming an official sponsor to
her. Through sponsorship, each contestant receives all the necessary training,
rehearsals, and financial support which will allow us to become<span>  very confident and well-prepared contestants
in this year's </span></span>Oakland/San Jose<span> Pageant.</span></span></p>
<p>We both would be deeply blessed and

<p>I already carry LGBT, Trans, Bisexual, Lesbian (both the 7-shade pink and the new orange-pink variant), Pansexual, Asexual and Non-Binary Pride Fist pins. I also have two pins in the production stages - POC LGBT Pride and the original Gilbert Baker LGBT flag! Help me reach everyone else.</p>

<li>My name is Erik, I'm a soon-to-be 26 year old  gay transgender man living in England. I had an idea a little over two years ago to open an LGBT+ focused clothing and accessories brand and I've not stopped since! Abprallen was born and has continued to grow, providing the community I share in with everything I hoped to deliver and more! </li>
<li>As Abprallen has grown and reached more and more people across the globe I've been able to help people within the community wear their pride in the form of tshirts, pins, patches and badges. I've also had a number of mugs, flags,  bags, prints, and stickers too! With my growing reach and the expanding range of Pride Fist flags I've seen more and more people asking for more specific (but equally important) flags to be represented</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

With the success of this campaign I can make that a thing of the past, making my community (and myself) happy!</li>
<li>Abrallen started with an Indiegogo campaign! I raised over £500 (the minimum I could raise) to cover the costs of my first items! A t-shirt, two pins, and three button badges. Since then I've grown and grown, being able to produce several T-shirt designs, multiple pins and a bunch of button badges!

<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p>My name is Rian Ismadia and I am the cofounder of Maris Equi. About a year ago, I came to the United States from Indonesia. I earned my degree in business from Universitas Gadjah Mada in Indonesia which included a year of classes at Rijksuniversiteit Groningenin in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The goal of my Indiegogo campaign is to raise enough money that I can manufacture a large quantity underwear for my new company, Maris Equi. I need quantities large enough that I can get the true economy of scale associated with large volume manufacturing. My first manufacturing run is complete, but it is only 7100 units. 7100 units is not enough to get the best pricing on fabric, waistbands, and labor costs. Money is also needed to step up marketing, develop my web presence, and cover basic business expenses. </p>
<p>Its important to note, Maris Equi's first manufacturing order is complete and on the way! What I ask of the Indiegogo crowd funding community is to buy out my pilot order before it even arrives. If we can do this, Maris Equi can use that money to make a more substantial underwear buy, benefit from quantity discounts, and have a strong inventory for a proper grand opening of our store on Shopify.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</h3>
<p>The goal of the campaign is to sell out of our first pilot order. If we do sell out, the campaign will raise $71,000. Any amount raised will go right back into the company and go toward a second larger order.</p>
<p>The joy of this campaign is there is no risk to you, the contributor. The product designs are finalized, the products are manufactured, and it is all on the way. The photos you see of our products are all real. The photos are of advance production units.  Nothing is rendered because our products have already been manufactured.</p>
<p>Contributors to our campaign get their choice of underwear or swimwear bundles. We have bundles based on fabric, style, or just go ahead and get one of everything! Our goal is to ship within 30 days. Choose from our Bombacio line if you are looking for fun and fashion.

</div></div>","Introduction:
My name is Rian Ismadia and I am the cofounder of Maris Equi. About a year ago, I came to the United States from Indonesia. I earned my degree in business from Universitas Gadjah Mada in Indonesia which included a year of classes at Rijksuniversiteit Groningenin in the Netherlands.
The goal of my Indiegogo campaign is to raise enough money that I can manufacture a large quantity underwear for my new company, Maris Equi. I need quantities large enough that I can get the true economy of scale associated with large volume manufacturing. My first manufacturing run is complete, but it is only 7100 units. 7100 units is not enough to get the best pricing on fabric, waistbands, and labor costs. Money is also needed to step up marketing, develop my web presence, and cover basic business expenses. 
Its important to note, Maris Equi's first manufacturing order is complete and on the way! What I ask of the Indiegogo crowd funding community is to buy out my pilot order before it even arrives. If we can do this, Maris Equi can use that money to make a more substantial underwear buy, benefit from quantity discounts, and have a strong inventory for a proper grand opening of our store on Shopify.

What We Need & What You Get:
The goal of the campaign is to sell out of our first pilot order. If we do sell out, the campaign will raise $71,000. Any amount raised will go right back into the company and go toward a second larger order.
The joy of this campaign is there is no risk to you, the contributor. The product designs are finalized, the products are manufactured, and it is all on the way. The photos you see of our products are all real. The photos are of advance production units.  Nothing is rendered because our products have already been manufactured.
Contributors to our campaign get their choice of underwear or swimwear bundles. We have bundles based on fabric, style, or just go ahead and get one of everything! Our goal is to ship within 30 days. Choose from our Bombacio line if you are looking for fun and fashion. Choose from our Viridi Sport line if you want underwear for your sporting active life. Our Viridi Sport Underwear is made from a 95% Bamboo, 5% Spandex blend. Our bamboo blend fabric is super soft, moisture wicking, and nonabrasive. It is ideal wear during vigorous activity.
Risks and Challenges:
Maris Equi is in the ""garage stage"" of evolution. We need to grow into a real space, evolve operations, and develop efficient fulfillment procedures. My biggest concern is we risk being overwhelmed in this early stage. As a contributor, our company challenges and concerns are no risk to you.

Help Spread the Word!Whether or not you contribute, we need your help getting the word out! Tweet about BareBands. Facebook about BareBands. Email about BareBands. Draw a picture about BareBands.  And then Instagram it.We’re trying to build a fun watch that you’re going to love wearing and continuously customizing over time. And, more than that, we’re trying to build a brand that wraps all that fun and self-expression up into something meaningful. We just need your help to get there. Thank you.P.S. Maybe you've heard of these ""smartwatches"" and ""activity monitors""? We have, too. With your support we'll be able to look into adding those types of functionality down the road. And our modular system means that when we do, all you'll have to do is slide the old piece out and the new one in. Easy peezy.",14.0,1,"4 Campaigns

<p>ZOOOII sneakers let you show off your style all day and into the night, with dazzling lights that set you apart from the crowd. They go with you comfortably from casual days to the wildest all-night parties.</p>

<p>ZOOOII team has 20 years of shoe industry experience and has cooperated with many famous sneakers and luxury brands. ZOOOII sneaker is our first self-developed product for the consumer market. We’re on a mission to build the world's best smart wearable system.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ZOOOII originated from the discussion with a breaking master on how to make the highly-difficult action show a more dazzling performance effect on the stage. Aaron Cai and Danny Yang, who have extensive experience in making shoes, and Ranto Liu, who are good at developing interactive light effects, were inspired to create a wearable brand that makes movements cooler. In the end, ZOOOII was born.</p>

Most light sneakers aren’t exactly comfortable, and unable to create dynamic, interactive lighting effects based on motions or movement, we get it. So we set out to design innovative light-up sneakers that are smart, comfortable, sleek and stylish.
ZOOOII sneakers let you show off your style all day and into the night, with dazzling lights that set you apart from the crowd. They go with you comfortably from casual days to the wildest all-night parties.

ZOOOII team has 20 years of shoe industry experience and has cooperated with many famous sneakers and luxury brands. ZOOOII sneaker is our first self-developed product for the consumer market. We’re on a mission to build the world's best smart wearable system.
 
ZOOOII originated from the discussion with a breaking master on how to make the highly-difficult action show a more dazzling performance effect on the stage. Aaron Cai and Danny Yang, who have extensive experience in making shoes, and Ranto Liu, who are good at developing interactive light effects, were inspired to create a wearable brand that makes movements cooler. In the end, ZOOOII was born.",50.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>It started as an obsession to find a comfortable pair of jeans that you could put on in the morning and wear cycling, hiking or climbing, and still look stylish for a meeting or night out. This was the foundation for Boulder Denim. Knowing that there are many pants with many features we decided to design a pant that included the most useful of those features, making them the most functional and stylish jeans on the market.</p>

<p><b>Our sizing guarantee to YOU:</b></p>
<p>In the year we spent developing Boulder Denim we realized a few important things about fit and sizing.</p>
<p>For women, we discovered that we could completely simplify the fitting process when we finally settled on the blend that makes up our patented ultra-stretch denim.

</div></div>","It started as an obsession to find a comfortable pair of jeans that you could put on in the morning and wear cycling, hiking or climbing, and still look stylish for a meeting or night out. This was the foundation for Boulder Denim. Knowing that there are many pants with many features we decided to design a pant that included the most useful of those features, making them the most functional and stylish jeans on the market.








Our sizing guarantee to YOU:
In the year we spent developing Boulder Denim we realized a few important things about fit and sizing.
For women, we discovered that we could completely simplify the fitting process when we finally settled on the blend that makes up our patented ultra-stretch denim. After testing our woman’s cut on women that are both slim and curvy, we were able to design a single cut that fits virtually all body types.
Because men don’t typically wear skin tight clothing it was important to design a cut that sits naturally on a man’s lower body, while not being overly tight. This discovery lead to the creation of our two fits, SLIM and ATHLETIC.
We are so confident with our sizing that if your jeans don’t fit, all you do is send them back to us and we will send you another pair on us.
*Customers outside of North America will be charged an additional $20 for international shipping.


 FOR MEN:
To determine your fit, there are two key measurements.
First, measure the smallest part of your waist at your natural waistline. Second, measure your thigh 2 inches below your crotch Then cross reference, your waist and thigh measurement with the sizing chart to determine your fit. Men looking for a skinny fit can size down. The denim will stretch to your body.


FOR WOMEN:
You only need to measure the smallest part of your waist at your natural waistline. Our jeans are so incredibly stretchy to ensure an absolutely skin tight fit we recommend sizing down.


Made with the climber in mind and created to truly combine fashion and adventure for a slimmer fit you can wear anytime.

Medium rise that sits just above the hip, slim through the thigh, knee and calf with a slight taper
Offers a perfectly tailored fit that works for men with slim to medium legs.
Fits well for slim or medium builds as the taper increases proportionally with waist size.

BEST FOR: Men with slim to medium legs that want a tailored look.






For the gym rat, crossfitter or bodybuilder. This fit is muscular-glute approved and designed for men that spend a lot time in the gym.

Medium rise that sits just above the hip, more room through the thigh, knee and calf with a slight taper.
Offers more thigh and calf room for men with muscular legs.

BEST FOR: Men with big legs that have trouble finding pants that can accommodate their thighs. These are for the crossfitter, bodybuilder or football player that never skips leg day. They also look great on men with thicker legs or larger builds that are looking for a roomier fit.






Designed to combine our 360-degree stretch and a perfect cut that embraces the natural movement of a woman’s body. The stretch is perfect for women of all shapes.

Medium/Higher rise, that is meant to move with you as your body bends.
The ultra-stretch denim allows you to have a higher-waist that doesn’t restrict movement or dig in when you bend over.

BEST FOR: Women that are slim to very curvy. The denim is so unbelievably stretchy that it will hug even the most curvaceous women.
So rest assured and order with confidence that not only will these pants fit you perfectly and feel amazing, your butt will look phenomenal!

<p>We’re Anna &amp; Tony, ambitious Industrial designers and the founders of 'DUCKSINAROW'. For long time we worked together in a leading international photo bag company and now we have decided to follow our true passion, break away from the utilitarian world and come back to the world of fashion. We set out to bring our take on urban fashion and lifestyle to the sophisticated urban city cyclists, who cycle to work every day. Cycling is a passion we have both shared for years and since we embraced this fantastic mode of healthier, greener transport we have never looked back. We found it difficult to find a practical and elegant solution for carrying a laptop while riding your bicycle, so we created one. While developing this bag, we focused on creating the best solution for the commuter’s every day needs with a combination of style &amp; fashion!  </p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Both of us worked for a long time for a professional photo bags company, we bring the knowledge and the experience from the top high tech bag industry and we chose an extremely experienced manufacturer which is producing bags for the top brands for years. We will be accompanying the process , hands-on, in every step of the way. Making sure that quality of our products, starting from the finest and carefully chosen materials and up to the sewers and their craftsmanship, is not compromised and that our backers get the product we have been dreaming of.</p>
<p>We are convinced that we will find a solution for every challenge that might appear along the way. Of course, we will keep you updated at every step! We took extra time buffer for shipping and for unprecedented delays, so we will do every thing to keep the time line as scheduled. We have done our homework on shipping and fulfillment, to keep it smooth.</p>
<p>Customer service is a very very important to us and we will continue to work our hardest to make sure everyone is satisfied. Having said that, we know that things can happen during the production process that can cause minor delays. In the event we encounter issues, rest assured, we’re all over it! And of course, we’ll keep you updated, every step of the way.</p>

While developing this bag, we focused on creating the best solution for the commuter’s every day needs with a combination of style & fashion!  


If you went all the way we're in awe! Thank you for the support!


Risks and challenges
Both of us worked for a long time for a professional photo bags company, we bring the knowledge and the experience from the top high tech bag industry and we chose an extremely experienced manufacturer which is producing bags for the top brands for years. We will be accompanying the process , hands-on, in every step of the way. Making sure that quality of our products, starting from the finest and carefully chosen materials and up to the sewers and their craftsmanship, is not compromised and that our backers get the product we have been dreaming of.
We are convinced that we will find a solution for every challenge that might appear along the way. Of course, we will keep you updated at every step! We took extra time buffer for shipping and for unprecedented delays, so we will do every thing to keep the time line as scheduled. We have done our homework on shipping and fulfillment, to keep it smooth.
Customer service is a very very important to us and we will continue to work our hardest to make sure everyone is satisfied. Having said that, we know that things can happen during the production process that can cause minor delays. In the event we encounter issues, rest assured, we’re all over it! And of course, we’ll keep you updated, every step of the way.

I have a story to tell and it's about a 55 yr. young father who means the world to me, that's my dad (Rick). My dad has Cirrhosis of the liver, caused from numerous medications. My dad has worked all his life, until he was let go from his job and became ill. He's been disabled since 2006 and has been coping with his disabilities. He's had some reservations about not  being able to provide for his family. My dad has always been my protector, mentor, provider, best friend, and hero. He's my biggest fan and he always tells me how proud he is of me. Dad enjoys hearing about my day in school and we  spend family time at home, or a night at a hotel. I never thought a night at a hotel would be fun, but if you had parents like mine, I wouldn't trade it for anything else. Dad promised we'll do it again, when he gets better. Dad is in constant pain and mom (Annie) is right there by his side. I catch her crying at times, because she feels she's not doing enough. I see her stressed, tired, and overwhelmed. I help with what I can do, to make it easier on the both of them. Dad has Health Insurance, but mom doesn't. Mom had a stroke last October(2011), and was let go from her job. She was a great Phlebotomist, the patients loved her and still think the world of her. The medical bills are starting to stack up, mom says everything will be okay, but I can see the stress on her face. Dad will need to go have a series of tests, then we wait for the call, to say he's been accepted on the liver transplant list. That's when it starts, the VA will help fly my parents for a week to Houston, Tx. for more tests, and every 3 months for 3 days till there's a match. When the call for a match comes in, then they are flown back to Houston for surgery and stay for a month. The VA will cover the travel, the hotel, and the surgery, but not the every day expenses. That can get very expensive. When dad gets sick and mom calls 911 and he's taken out side of the VA, she worries how the bill is going to get paid. Mom is still trying to pay for her own medical bills, I'm scared for her. The two us have to stay healthy for dad, and she's dad's primary supporter. I need help to relieve some of the stress from the financial burden, Please help me help them breath a little easier. I do know the medical bills are close to $53,500.00, that includes mom's hospital and rehab. bills. HELP! Thank you and many blessings to all of you. My dad has more reason to live longer, me. I just lost my grandpa to lung cancer, this past May, I'm not ready to loose my dad.</p></div>","Hi! My name is Ricky and I'm 16 years old.

<p>The hammock form is full of useful features. The backpack flap doubles as a drink holder and a large velcro pocket to store any loose items.

</div><div><p>The idea for Hammbag first came to us on a road trip up the coast of New South Wales, Australia. We drove from Sydney to Byron Bay, stopping at many beaches along the way.. Tom had brought his regular hammock and slung his towel, water, sunscreen, football and speaker in it like a sack to the beach. We thought, surely we can make this more efficient and... here it is, our final product. We are insanely passionate about our idea, we use ours everyday and we hope to share it with you. </p></div><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464859428/photo_edit_story_yxvm7r.png"" src=""""/></p></div><div><i>The Byron Crew.</i></div><div>

We’ve challenged our product to withstand winters in Europe, beaches in Australia, road trips through New Zealand and everyday life. In every situation the Hammbag has performed beyond our expectations. In fact, we were always surprised at how many places the Hammbag worked.. Whether we'd just stopped to hang and study in the park or needed it as a blanket couch surfing our way around the UK, it was always there! At first the Hammbag was a novelty we took to the beach, but now it has become essential to any great adventure. Even now we've impressed ourselves with how well it works and are constantly finding new ways to use the Hammbag and add to its design. We’re excited to see where the Hammbag will take others as well and want to spread the word!</span></p><div><img alt=""grootTree"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://thecavern132.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/grootTree-.jpg"" src=""""/></div><div>

<p>We're highly passionate about this project and our dream is to one day be walking around Byron and see a Hammbag walk by! </p>
<p>We've been discussing with our suppliers to organise smaller quantities as well as  better shipping rates to make delivery as cheap as possible.  We've also arranged for 6 different designs to give more variety and selection to our range. </p>
<p>Even if our goal is not 100% met, we've discussed with several investors in contributing to our fund. However, we are trying as hard as possible to keep this to a crowed funded project. Either way you'll be getting your Hammbag soon!!</p>

</div></div>","The Hammbag is your backpack anywhere, your towel at the beach, your bed while camping, and that perfect seat in the park. In a minute the Hammbag can transform easily between a bag, towel and hammock. Its durable, reliable, and extremely comfy. We’ve spent the past year fine tuning prototype models in order to bring you the best, most versatile bag we can think of.Get yours Now!http://hammbag.comhttps://thecavern.com.au/shop/hammbag

 

The hammock form is full of useful features. The backpack flap doubles as a drink holder and a large velcro pocket to store any loose items. The two interior pockets can be used as a pillow or neck support. The Hammbag comes with two Grunt pull tie down straps allowing you to use any branch, pole or anything you can find for stable and sturdy hammock support.

When folding the Hammbag into bag form it can be folded into two different bag styles. A normal backpack as well as a single strap bag. Whether you're going on a walk, run or skate you can quickly customise the way you wear your bag.
The Hammbag is duel layered, with a towel interior and a canvas exterior. The soft towel is perfect for beach and the pool, accompanied by the canvas it makes the Hammbag extremely durable and resistant. When in Hammock form the canvas stops all wind, and the towel makes for a cozy sleep.   

We've used a lightweight canvas for the outside and a soft towel lining for the interior. The supporting ropes and straps are heavy duty and will easily support up to 120kg / 260lbs. The adjustable black straps also allow for an expanded volume of up to four times its original capacity.
 
This will not be the exterior design of the Hammbag you will receive. There'll be several designs including a tie dye option made! The Hammbag's large pockets can hold not 1, not 2, 3, or 4 but 5 laptops, text books and more!  All 5 laptops (13"", 14"", 3x15"")! all in separate pockets and fitted very comfortably.
The pillow pockets are a great support for your head when filled with just a couple of items of clothing. They are also a handy way to keep your drinks cool with a few ice-packs or your wallet safe when it's in bag form.
Our side flap has 2 pockets, the larger with Velcro. These pockets are perfect for secure and quick access to your wallet, phone, keys and can even hold your drink!Folding between the towel, hammock and bag is a fast and painless process! in under 2 minutes you can go from your bag, to relaxing in a tree.
  
The idea for Hammbag first came to us on a road trip up the coast of New South Wales, Australia. We drove from Sydney to Byron Bay, stopping at many beaches along the way.. Tom had brought his regular hammock and slung his towel, water, sunscreen, football and speaker in it like a sack to the beach. We thought, surely we can make this more efficient and... here it is, our final product. We are insanely passionate about our idea, we use ours everyday and we hope to share it with you. The Byron Crew.

Our Beds in Byron!

 

We've been using our prototypes in practise for over a year now. We’ve challenged our product to withstand winters in Europe, beaches in Australia, road trips through New Zealand and everyday life. In every situation the Hammbag has performed beyond our expectations. In fact, we were always surprised at how many places the Hammbag worked.. Whether we'd just stopped to hang and study in the park or needed it as a blanket couch surfing our way around the UK, it was always there! At first the Hammbag was a novelty we took to the beach, but now it has become essential to any great adventure. Even now we've impressed ourselves with how well it works and are constantly finding new ways to use the Hammbag and add to its design. We’re excited to see where the Hammbag will take others as well and want to spread the word!
Hanging out in the park after a game of soccer. Finding a spot to chill with mates or just to sit and read outdoors can be a common spontaneous event.  Sleeping in Byron Bay in style!

When road tripping setting up a bed  has never been so easy, comfortable and mobile!

Camping has never been so easy and comfortable; whether you're fully equipped or camping on bare minimum, it suites all occasions.  Having picnics in the park is a no brainer with the Hammbag.  Don't forget those drunk nights where your bed is just to far or your mates couch is 'occupied'.

 
 Our Goal

 
We're highly passionate about this project and our dream is to one day be walking around Byron and see a Hammbag walk by! 
We've been discussing with our suppliers to organise smaller quantities as well as  better shipping rates to make delivery as cheap as possible.  We've also arranged for 6 different designs to give more variety and selection to our range. 
Even if our goal is not 100% met, we've discussed with several investors in contributing to our fund. However, we are trying as hard as possible to keep this to a crowed funded project. Either way you'll be getting your Hammbag soon!!
 
 



Risks & Challenges
 
 
We've done a lot of research over the last 15 months on materials, processing goods and product design to develop the product you see today. We are constantly trying to better our bag, so some minor design adjustments may be made in order to improve your overall Hammbag experience. Our only challenge now is to gain your support so we can continue on our quest to bring the people the bag they deserve.
If you have any other questions that we haven't been covered above or in the FAQs below please don't hesitate to email us: thecavernofficial@gmail.com

<p><strong>Approximately one billion people world-wide have limited access to drinkable water.</strong> Every pair of Waybu you purchase helps support the Waybu crew’s journey through Haiti where we will help give clean water independence to people in need. We’ve partnered with the inventor of the Aquapak (which is a solar water pasteurizer) to help give more of the life saving devices to families in Haiti. </p><p><b>The Waybu crew volunteers to make the life saving Aquapaks at a shop in San Diego.</b> The United Nations reported in 2013 that 80% of people in Haiti live below the poverty line and have to decide between buying clean water or food, something no one should have to go through. Inspired by Monty's near death experience from drinking contaminated water in the Sahara Desert, the Waybu crew strongly believes in sustaining your way while also helping to sustain others. </p>

Approximately one billion people world-wide have limited access to drinkable water. Every pair of Waybu you purchase helps support the Waybu crew’s journey through Haiti where we will help give clean water independence to people in need. We’ve partnered with the inventor of the Aquapak (which is a solar water pasteurizer) to help give more of the life saving devices to families in Haiti. The Waybu crew volunteers to make the life saving Aquapaks at a shop in San Diego. The United Nations reported in 2013 that 80% of people in Haiti live below the poverty line and have to decide between buying clean water or food, something no one should have to go through. Inspired by Monty's near death experience from drinking contaminated water in the Sahara Desert, the Waybu crew strongly believes in sustaining your way while also helping to sustain others.

<p>My name
is John Allen and I’m an Illustrator and Designer. My work is a collision of
both animal and human influences. Strength, individuality, agility, elegance,
&amp; grace.<span>   I attended school at
California College of the Arts in San Francisco majoring in Fashion Design.
 It was there that I honed in my vision. I worked on every project I
could, including a partnership with The Goodwill that promoted sustainability
and repurposing fabrics that had been discarded. Despite my accolades, my
true vision is to change manufacturing into a sustainable fashion. My goal is
to inspire the masses with my craft.<br/><br/>
I love deconstructing the undesired and breathing new life into my garments. I
am meticulous, even down to the texture of each embellishment. It was
the smell of stale fabric while watching my grandmother (Virgie Farmer)
deconstruct classic womenswear that sparked my initial love affair with
fashion. Some of my fondest memories of my childhood were caring for
animals, and vintage shopping with Virgie. She was a Performance Artist, and
serves as a primary inspiration to my overall aesthetic.  The other
dominating inspiration in my life is my Mother, and the thread of her essence
is apparent in all of my pieces. I grew up watching her create bold whimsical hairstyles,
and her work is nothing short of pure art-form. It was that edgy brilliance
paired with memories of Virgie that I will always attribute to the vision of my
lines.</span></p>
<p>I am
happy to share some exciting news; I have been selected as a featured
international designer to present a 20 look runway show at the 2014 Mercedes
Benz Fashion Week Panama on October 31st at 4:00pm in Panama City, Panama.</p>
<p>This will
be my<b> first </b>international runway show, and it will take place on
one of Latin Americas biggest stages in Fashion. I will also be
celebrating my birthday on this memorable occasion. </p>
<p>I will be
presenting my CULT AZ 2015 Summer Collection.  CULTZ AZ will push the
limits of contemporary fashion by revisiting the glamour of the romantic era
but with a modern twist of alternative opulence and the natural world.</p>
<p>In order

</div></div>","Our Story
Hello! We are Paradigm Threads Co. A UK inspired, extreme sports clothing brand. 

Our company is innovative, fairly priced, and creative enough to be the new trend-setter in the clothing industry. We have big ambitions, and we believe our mission is really going to be a PARADIGM for the rest of the industry to look up to.
We are made up of Tom, Jack, Oli & Ellie and our amazing team riders (all working hard for no wage)! As a company we strongly believe that high quality, organic fabrics should be available to our customers for a fair price.

We provide a range of clothing for people who love the lifestyle associated with action sports, and also for you cool seasoned riders.

With your help, we are looking to expand our small business by printing a wider variety of designs, advertising our new web store, and printing our shirts at a lower cost so we can pass the savings to you :)


The Impact
We have struggled to find funding up till now, as we like to absorb a lot of the cost to provide a fair price to the customer. This doesn’t provide big investors with a good enough return to part with their money. That’s where you guys come in!
We have set ourselves a goal of $6,500 as a maximum level goal. This is the amount of cash we need to go ahead with our ""expansion plans for world domination"", or just to get us out there! 
We have sold masses of shirts in our local area and online, however to reach a wider audience, we need all the funding we can get to make this thing huge!

 


In essence, the more we can raise here, the better!




What We Need & What You Get
In order to enhance our plans to take the industry by storm with fresh, inventive and creative ideas, we need to do the following things...
 


Broadening the range by introducing hoodies, new designs and more women's clothing
Speak to larger retailers to stock our garments, and attend trade shows
Ordering a higher number of garments so that we can reduce our per unit cost, and carry this cost to the consumer
Help transport our ‘chill out’ zone to events
Travel to a larger number of events around the UK to promote ourselves, including NASS and Beach Break Live.
Shoot more cool footage of our team riders, and support our cameraman, Jack
Advertise paradigm through Facebook, events and adverts in magazine
Get creative with some really awesome competitions

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Coming up as a teenager in the Bronx of New York, learning and playing Volleyball was one of the most difficult things ever. I remember friends and family members being able to play baseball, basketball, football, or soccer for little or no money at all while some of my other friends and I suffered by turning down offers to play on Volleyball clubs because of the cost.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Coming from the Bronx, asking your parents to pay out between $1,500 or even $3,700 is a ridiculous joke which most parents laugh about and totally dismiss without recognizing the seriousness of their child and the possibilities within. This is where Legacy comes in!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Legacy Volleyball is a non-profit organization working diligently to provide Volleyball training and education not just to elite players, but also to any young athlete who wants to learn the sport of Volleyball. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Every Coach holds a high standard of education, which will be instilled onto the athletes in an effort to promote higher education and a higher standard of living.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There over 1,000 colleges and universities sponsoring woman's Volleyball across the nation. Together, they are offering over 12,000 Volleyball scholarships! By playing club Volleyball, each athlete is exposed to this grand opportunity that might be the difference between going to college or not!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A major distraction from today's world of war, poverty, bullying, and  adolescent pregnancy among many others.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are creating and expanding a network of friends who will share and enjoy the social benefits of Volleyball for years to come!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Without this opportunity, we are leaving thousands of players in New York City without a chance just because they did not make a team or could not afford to pay for a club. Helps us in our efforts to provide Volleyball to all  student athletes!</p>

<p>Hey, I'm Felicia Barth-Aasen and I'm the founder/creative director of The Collective. I graduated from The Fashion Institute of Technology in 2011 with a B.F.A. in fashion design. </p>
</li>
<li>
</li>
<li>I've always wanted to be a fashion designer and after interning with several companies in N.Y.C. I decided I was extremely passionate about creating my own line. So, this May after taking 9 months to save up my own money, I started my line. The goal was to start a business that would impact our local economy by employing artisans within our own community. I wanted to be able to trace where my clothing was coming from. I wanted to know that it was being produced in an ethical way and bring work to the U.S. at the same time. </li>
<li>
</li>
<li>So far we've been able to create consistent work for two artisans and in the future we hope to grow even more in this area by collaborating with artists to create specialty pieces and by sourcing american made materials whenever possible. </li>
<li>We want to create a space where creative minds can meet; where people of different backgrounds can collaborate to build a brand that is responsibly produced and sold. </li>
<li>
</li>
<li>We're currently producing 15 looks for our runway show as an official event of L.A. fashion week in October and getting ready to officially launch The Collective! Fashion week is so important because we need the opportunity to be exposed to buyers, media and consumers. It's an amazing opportunity and we are well on our way to getting there…But we need your support! </li>

<li>The $5,000 goal will help cover the costs of L.A. fashion week, sample making, and marketing for the launch of the collection.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>I am a student at Minnesota School of Business in Richfield, MN. I am finishing my Bachelor's of Fine Arts for Digital Video and Media Production. This project is being broken up into three classes: pre-production, production and post production; spanning over the time of 9 months. My graduation date is expected to be December of 2012.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I want to expose, inspire and educate women about archery. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am looking to raise $3,000 in order to pay for gas, craft services, <em>equipment rental </em>(camera, studio, lab, etc.) , props for the interview room, DVDs, stock photography (if I am unable to get a hold of a DSLR,)  and hopefully enough to pay my crew. </p>

<p>The Senior Show is our opportunity to present our solutions to the public. <b>While our drive to push our projects to reality is unwavering, we cannot do it alone.</b>  </p>
<p><b>With your generosity, we can secure printing costs. </b></p>
<p>But other basic needs include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Professional displays</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Promotional materials</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Furniture and equipment rentals</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Event catering</span></li>
</ul>We want to host an exhibition worthy of the heart and hard work we put into these projects, but to do so will require significant funding, as printing costs alone surpass our listed campaign goal.<br/><p></p>

</div></div>","Who We Are & What We Aim to Accomplish We are seniors studying Product Design at Drexel University, and we are a small group of individuals driven by a common goal to make positive changes in the world. We have spent the past seven months developing our senior thesis projects, which tackle difficult issues ranging from public education to environmentalism. 
Creating viable solutions to these issues has been incredibly challenging, and we are proud and excited to finally introduce our solutions to the public at the Product Design Senior Show in June. 


Why We Need Your Help We are completely responsible for everything that goes into this event from funding, to catering, to building the displays for our work. We cover everything for our individual projects out-of-pocket, but the cost of show itself is more than we can afford on our own. 


Despite cutting corners as much as possible, the total budget for the show is $6,000. This is why we ask for your generosity, to facilitate the production of an event with the potential to bring our solutions to reality. 


Update May 9 We are thrilled to have met our initial goal for this page. THANK YOU!! However, between this and our other fundraising efforts, we are still about $3,000 short of the total cost of the show.

   Details & Benefits

The Senior Show is our opportunity to present our solutions to the public. While our drive to push our projects to reality is unwavering, we cannot do it alone.  
With your generosity, we can secure printing costs. 
But other basic needs include:

Professional displays
Promotional materials
Furniture and equipment rentals
Event catering
We want to host an exhibition worthy of the heart and hard work we put into these projects, but to do so will require significant funding, as printing costs alone surpass our listed campaign goal.

Benefits for Suggested Donation Amounts$125+  A custom T-shirt, designed by our class, a Product Design mug, and a special Thank You in the event program$75+  Product Design mug, custom designed token of appreciation, and a special Thank You in the event program$35+  Product Design mug and a special Thank You in the event program$15+  A special Thank You in the event program




    Our Potential Our program is relatively new -ours is the second graduating class- but talent and drive has led to student involvement working with companies such as Comcast, Honeywell, Martha Stewart, Ecco Design, K'Nex, Inglis House, and more. 
We are smart. We are driven. We are talented. We care, and we can make a difference. To do that, we need people to see our work.

    
Other Ways You Can Help Don't have spare cash to give to strangers? We get it, and we thank you just for taking the time to watch our video and read our campaign. 
We ask you to simply share this page, so other people can learn about us and our solutions, and there is a higher chance that our hard work will be put to good use. 


The ShowDisplays will be up in the URBN Annex beginning May 31st. The event night will be Friday, June 5 from 4pm to 8pm.



The Projects





EATSENTIALS Apollonia Heinz Waste is a global epidemic. In the US, the average person makes an average of 7 lbs of waste a day and 1/3 of the US total waste is food containers/packaging. My product works to use waste accumulation as a way of limiting the amount of waste people create. Through creating easy to use and transport reusable food containers and developing a maintenance system to care for the containers, it is possible to divert otherwise useful materials from landfills.






The Smart Faucet Connor WhiteEvery human has the right to clean and sustainable water. My name is Connor White, cofounder and chief creative officer of Tern. At Tern, we strive to create an independent, sustainable water system within homes through the installation of modular products. The Smart Faucet is the first product of several which achieves the Tern vision through purification and information-sharing.


Stratify Maia Ottenstein
 Most contemporary solutions to improve student achievement neglect the importance of student fulfillment. This project seeks to improve the public school student’s academic experience by facilitating more rewarding and efficient interactions with content. Stratify supports focus and builds understanding through visual organization, and facilitates the enhancement of critical thinking skills using non-intimidating guides for reflection.



BeeThere Minsu Jin
In a world of rapid development, I believe in designs that bring convenience and timesaving solutions into modern life. BeeThere is a short-distance navigation device that connects transportations at airports and train stations. It minimizes uncertainty between transferring gaps by providing a continuous route and clear information to help travelers quickly find the next place they have to be.



Keepsake Stephanie Kovacs
Art is inherently connective. Through an immersive research process, current barriers to art interpretation are analyzed and new ways to promote active visitor engagement within art museums are investigated. The solution, Keepsake, is a system that celebrates and aids the physical process of viewing art while integrating digital tools for more in-depth discovery. A physical guide helps visitors to find their way while a digital platform enables visitors to capture art beyond museum walls.



Osmosis Sean Preston
Osmosis is a professional navigation platform designed to facilitate career exploration and provide personalized career discovery tools for high school students. Through Osmosis, students have the ability to connect with professionals and learn from the experiences of people like them. It can be difficult to find out what you want to pursue after high school, but it doesn’t have to be. With Osmosis, you can easily find people similar to you to see which schools and professions may be a good fit for you.




arTIPS Mai Lu
Our society is one that greatly undervalues artists. There are few services geared specifically towards’ artists needs. Artists grow by connecting with and learning from other artists, but often lack the means to make those connections and find needed information. arTIPS is an app-based platform to connect artists and serve as a community for sharing and seeking resources. By providing artists with the tools to find needed information more easily, artists can empower themselves.



Synesthesia Max Solomon
This project explores how design can use multisensory immersion to educate an individual about their experiences in relation to their environment. The Synesthesia System enables a user to undergo a process of introspective reflection by recording their experiences and then categorizing them by emotion and location. The aims of this project are to help guide the user towards a broader comfort zone in their local area, as well as towards a more self-actualized existence.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>In 2013, founder of Uphill Designs Dan Sedlacek hiked from Mexico to Canada along the Pacific Crest Trail. As a PCT thru-hiker who made much of his own gear for the 2,665 mile trek, Dan understands what it takes for products to hold up on any terrain. Because of his experiences on the trail, he sought to create a new type of hiking equipment that better connects hikers to their natural surroundings.</p>

<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/002/777/c111976b35a3495095355368d7c7b175_original.png?v=1448907225&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=d7274d3d64bacf08322c8c16e309569b"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p>At Uphill Designs, we believe that the gear we use in nature reflects our attitudes towards it. Our gear evokes the feelings of being on the trail: natural materials, burned logos, and simple designs leave a hiker yearning for the simple beauty of the woods and the smell of a campfire. We know that the modern adventurer spends most of their time away from nature so we built a product that allows everyone to stay connected with the outdoors wherever they go.</p>

In 2013, founder of Uphill Designs Dan Sedlacek hiked from Mexico to Canada along the Pacific Crest Trail. As a PCT thru-hiker who made much of his own gear for the 2,665 mile trek, Dan understands what it takes for products to hold up on any terrain. Because of his experiences on the trail, he sought to create a new type of hiking equipment that better connects hikers to their natural surroundings.


At Uphill Designs, we believe that the gear we use in nature reflects our attitudes towards it. Our gear evokes the feelings of being on the trail: natural materials, burned logos, and simple designs leave a hiker yearning for the simple beauty of the woods and the smell of a campfire. We know that the modern adventurer spends most of their time away from nature so we built a product that allows everyone to stay connected with the outdoors wherever they go.

</div></div>","It’s a dilemma any fashionista will recognize: you’ve found the perfect bag after years of hunting. The only problem: its about $200 more than you wanted to pay. Then, when you do find a bag that does meet your price range, the style just isn’t quite up to pay with what your aesthetic.GINIK is an ambitious up-and-coming Italian designer brand that competes with names such as Gucci, Prada and
Louis Vuitton. The key factor that distinguishes GINIK from these entrenched fashion giants is that GINIK gives
customers the freedom to choose the level of quality of the design that he or she would like. This process entirely
changes the shopping industry by satisfying the customer in every shape and form. The result: GINIK has the
vision, strategy and product to revolutionize the designer fashion industry. And that mission starts here. 









After our research and analysis of the general fashion market and its competitors was
performed, we have to invent and introduce new strategies, solutions and actions. The
new strategic goals that have been set to start the company are:


Luxury fashion electronic:  Women can never go out without carrying their bags full of cosmetics, makeup, mirror, etc. We want to introduce a new dynamic solution to that. They can still carry all those things in their bag but with freedom(from 1° year)
Introducing a new dynamic system called “Grades” that makes luxury fashion for all.(Not for poorest)(from first year)
Introduce the most beautiful dynamic designs(new) to attract customers(from first year)
Despite our 10 wholesalers in 7 major countries in the world that we have already, we will create more huge amount of channels      for marketing. More wholesalers, retailers, online marketing(from 1° yr)
Introduce a new fashion technology for the first time: The fashion technology collection is made of three devices: Scio device, smart bag Shoulder Belt Device and Medical device. (from 2° year)
Luxury fashion mechanic: High heel equilibrium to 65% of women worldwide who have difficulty walking on high heel(from 3° year). To understand solution, you can see this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFpRLjmAicc 
Introducing the possibilities of Luxury Fashion at your command: Depending on your budget (from 4th year)
Introduce New Fashion Traveling Office(Technologies):This will come with executive GINIK  traveling bags that make you connected with your office. Even if your office is in New York but you are in London for any purpose, as long as you have your GINIK traveling bag, your office is right  there with you.(from 5° year)
Introduce new Fashion Portable Office(Technologies): (from 6° year)
Introduce new children’s line(from 8° year)
Introduce sports line(from 10° year)



In order to stand before our competitors, these above several strategies, solutions and actions are going to be implemented for the first time in the world of Luxury Fashion Industry.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>David has been designing things big and small for over 10 years.</i></p></figure></div><p>Our designs emerged from a dissatisfaction with the generic minimalism that is currently flooding the micro-brand watch field. As designers, we view the watch as an artistic canvas, and are excited by its unique creative possibilities. But most watches never fulfill this potential. </p><p>We wanted to completely re-imagine watch design, to create a timepiece that makes the most of this medium's uniqueness. And the most unique and fundamental part of a watch, as we see it, is movement. We were inspired by the potential of using time's movement to create visual beauty, and perhaps even philosophical meaning.</p><p>In our design research, we drew inspiration from the Kinetic Art movement, vibrant in the early 20th century. Kinetic artists broke from traditional static art pieces, and created art that produced beauty through movement. These innovative visual experiences created new interactive relationships between the artwork and the viewer.</p><div data-id=""20274834""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Tinguely (1954), Duchamp (1913), Riley (1964)"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1523474913/hyzddbqllpr716kr4ckw.jpg"" src=""""/><figcaption><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Tinguely (1954), Duchamp (1913), Riley (1964)</i></p></figcaption></figure></div><p> </p><div data-id=""20321321""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1523474915/tfzo4ya4s2wsdse29v2v.png"" src=""""/></p></figure></div><p>Since the industrial revolution, we have become subservient to external routines. Time has become a number used to regiment our lives.  </p><p>Our Kinetic Art designs use the movement of time to reconceive the watch's purpose. Instead of a keeper of routine, our watches turn time into spellbinding art, revealing the beauty of the flowing present.</p><p>Time is no longer a number — time is beauty, time is art. The present is no longer to be planned away, but to be appreciated, as the flow of time mesmerizes and enchants us.</p><div data-id=""20274499""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1523474916/ohjqtf1nt00rv3u7abks.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p></figure></div><p>Beyond pointing out a few unique visual aspects of each work, we will refrain from in-depth exposition here, as we believe the meaning of a work shouldn't be shackled by the creator.  </p><p>Instead, the abstract kinetics in each design are springboards from which each viewer can draw different personal meanings and inspirations. We have already been pleasantly surprised by the diversity of interpretations we have received. We hope our watches will move you, too.</p><p>Please note that when we upgraded our discs, we have also improved on our Kinetic Art designs.

David has been designing things big and small for over 10 years.Our designs emerged from a dissatisfaction with the generic minimalism that is currently flooding the micro-brand watch field. As designers, we view the watch as an artistic canvas, and are excited by its unique creative possibilities. But most watches never fulfill this potential. We wanted to completely re-imagine watch design, to create a timepiece that makes the most of this medium's uniqueness. And the most unique and fundamental part of a watch, as we see it, is movement. We were inspired by the potential of using time's movement to create visual beauty, and perhaps even philosophical meaning.In our design research, we drew inspiration from the Kinetic Art movement, vibrant in the early 20th century. Kinetic artists broke from traditional static art pieces, and created art that produced beauty through movement. These innovative visual experiences created new interactive relationships between the artwork and the viewer.Tinguely (1954), Duchamp (1913), Riley (1964) Since the industrial revolution, we have become subservient to external routines. Time has become a number used to regiment our lives.  Our Kinetic Art designs use the movement of time to reconceive the watch's purpose. Instead of a keeper of routine, our watches turn time into spellbinding art, revealing the beauty of the flowing present.Time is no longer a number — time is beauty, time is art. The present is no longer to be planned away, but to be appreciated, as the flow of time mesmerizes and enchants us.
 
 Beyond pointing out a few unique visual aspects of each work, we will refrain from in-depth exposition here, as we believe the meaning of a work shouldn't be shackled by the creator.  Instead, the abstract kinetics in each design are springboards from which each viewer can draw different personal meanings and inspirations. We have already been pleasantly surprised by the diversity of interpretations we have received. We hope our watches will move you, too.Please note that when we upgraded our discs, we have also improved on our Kinetic Art designs. The designs below are final, and slightly different from the designs seen in the other sections of this campaign.

 
  Four concentric rings of circles constitute this design. Alternating expansion and contraction make a play of perspective. Round forms, linear layers and smooth animation scales work together to produce a balanced design.  

 This ambitious design discards geometricism, using the overlapping of uneven layers to produce organic forms that morph as they spiral outwards. Varying angles create an illusion of differing speeds, adding to the design's dynamism. 
 
Using three sculpted discs instead of two, this design allows for more variation across time. Patterns change in symmetry and size as the hour and minute discs move across one another.  
 



 If David hadn't stepped into the world of design, he would have been working in the non-profit field. Even now, giving back remains a personal necessity in each of his design projects.  To keep with this vision, 5% of our sales will be donated to The Red Pencil, a non-profit that uses arts therapy to help those suffering from emotional trauma. Read more about their work with survivors of natural disasters, domestic abuse and human trafficking here.
 
 Designing a watch requires hundreds of small choices, and at every crossroads, we have chosen the path that leads to quality. Here's an introduction to the premium components we use to craft our watches.Unlike quartz watches which are powered by batteries, automatic watches are powered by human motion. Your arm's movement propels the hundreds of gears and springs precisely assembled in the watch mechanism — a feat of engineering artistry, and a refreshing change from the electronic circuitry we have gotten so used to. After much research, we chose the Japanese Seiko NH35A movement to power our watch, famed for its durability and reliability. A generation ahead of the already robust 7S26 and 8215, the NH35A is more refined, more accurate, and comes with hand-winding and hacking capabilities.Our custom movement design is a tribute to the Kinetic artists of the last century, who struggled with the tensions between human and machine as their lives became increasingly mechanized, even as they used these new machines in their art. In a way, the automatic watch, as a human-powered mechanism, is a vivid illustration of that relationship. It is poetic that the mesmerizing movement of time in your Kinetic Art watch will be propelled by your own movement.To frame our kinetic art, we designed a case that is minimalistic, almost geometric, with carefully balanced proportions, symmetrical bevels, and clean, angular forms. The case is made from brushed 316L surgical steel, which is much hardier than the cheaper and more common 304L steel.Designed to be water resistant to 5 ATM, our watches can be brought to the shower or the pool. However, we suggest you order an extra Milanese mesh band if you intend to get your watch wet, as leather straps are prone to water damage.Sapphire Crystal is incredibly scratch-resistant, rating '9' on the Mohs scale of hardness, just one spot behind diamonds. We use sapphire crystal for both the top and bottom glass, with additional anti-reflective coating applied on the top glass.Our straps are vegetable-tanned — a natural leather processing method that's much more time consuming than the more commonly found chemical-based chrome-tanning method. Vegetable-tanned leather ages beautifully, developing a patina over time.  We use full-grain leather for our straps — the strongest and most natural-looking type of leather, as it comes from the uppermost surface of the hide, where all the ""grain"" is preserved.Our leather straps come with quick release pins for easy removal. You can order additional 316L Milanese mesh straps for a different look. 

First forged in 19th century Italy, these straps are uniquely stylish, comfortable, and hardy. Add a set to your pledge if you'll like a different style option, or see yourself getting your watch wet.

All our watches are painstakingly hand-assembled. The expert levels of dexterity and skill required to handle our vanishingly thin discs mean that only veteran watch makers are able to assemble our watches.We are perfectionists here at Humism, and we take quality very seriously. All watch components are meticulously inspected before assembly, and multiple thorough inspections are carried out throughout the assembly process.  All watches are put through a series of stringent quality control tests, such as water resistance and drop tests. We take the additional step of manually regulating each watch's movement to ensure they keep time accurately.Our watches come with an 18 month warranty. 

With 39mm case sizes, our watches can be worn by both men and women. Our leather straps will fit most wrist sizes.",65.0,1,"1 Campaign

Making projects is a creator’s life …
Christian Gautier has been a creator all his life as a
photographer and a designer. He has been dreaming for years to design jewels.
It’s done. He took one year off to create a full collection, find the right producers,
elaborate the marketing plan, design the web communication and promotion tools.
All tests have shown his style is highly attractive. Our marketing and sales teamwork
is ready to work and sell. 

We’ve got a fashion creative product, we’ve got the
channels, but we miss the first 1000 jewels to start selling on the web as well
as in some fashion places.
That is
where we need your help ! 











We are cloose to the goal …
The first sketches of the jewel collection were born
less than one year ago. Christian made the first prototypes himself and then he

As he started alone, Christian placed all his energy

<p>Purchasing a t-shirt from my store will help with the operating expenses for my staffing company and will help me offer better more efficient services to get the underserved back working.  Creating more employment opportunities will help address some of the issues plaguing a lot of our communities and I want to be an advocate for the people seeking those opportunities.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<p>My goal is to raise <strong>$20,000 in 60 days.  That is 1,000 t-shirts!!</strong></p>

We kept blowing any money we saved — on trips to Vietnam and Paraguay. We <strong>didn't even have a garage</strong> that could later feature in the story of our humble beginnings.</p><p>We just knew <strong>one thing</strong>. We couldn't find a <a href=""https://minaal.com/ks3-carry-on"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">professional-looking backpack</a> specifically tailored to long-haul, minimalist, one-bag travel. All the existing options were either <em>the wrong size</em>, <em>too suitcase-y</em>, or simply <em>not durable enough</em> to go the distance.</p><p>The original <a href=""https://minaal.com/ks3-carry-on"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Minaal Carry-on</a> — which we launched in 2013 — was an attempt to change that status quo and kick off a <strong>Travel Revolution</strong> (albeit a bloodless one).</p><div data-id=""24514839""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><a href=""http://www.therosehotelvenice.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1556821495/bl8wtokljm37eu1ixxat.jpg"" src=""""/> </a></figure></div><p> </p><p>The support you gave us during our first crowdfunding campaign — and the incredible amount of discerning feedback and detailed feature requests you've given us since — is what allowed us to keep fighting the <a href=""https://minaal.com/ks3-track"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>War on Dangle</strong></a> and continue making thoughtful, carefully-crafted gear.</p><p>Listening to you over the years has also helped us define <em>who</em> we are, <em>why </em>we're here, and <em>what</em> it should mean to be part of the Minaal community. It helped us realise things like:</p><p><strong>1) You can be <a href=""https://minaal.com/ks3-track"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">“at home” everywhere</a>. </strong>We're making tools for a world where people change locations, jobs, cities – and <em>countries</em> – at will.</p><p><strong>2) Great products put the user first, second, and third. </strong>We prioritise the experience of actually using our products. We have no outside investors or arbitrary fashion cycles to please. If it's not a joy to use, we won't release it – because we won't use it ourselves.</p><p><strong>3) Quality saves money – and the environment. </strong>We live in a world where products are increasingly disposable. We make tools that are <em>indispensable,</em> not disposable.  Both from a financial and environmental perspective, the least expensive bag is the one you use the longest.</p><h1><strong>How we designed these bags</strong></h1><p> </p><div data-caption=""Not all buckles are created equal.

For more info, check out the 'key features' graphics further up the page.</p><p><em>Rolltop: </em></p><ul>
<li>Weight = 890g / 1.96lb</li>
<li>Dimensions = 32 x 12 x 48cm / 12.6 x 4.7 x 18.9in (rolled)</li>
</ul><p><em>Crossbody: </em></p><ul>
<li>Weight = 290g / 0.65lb</li>
<li>Dimensions = 30 x 5 x 15cm / 11.8 x 2 x 5.9in</li>
</ul><p><strong>Will the Rolltop fit my laptop/tablet?</strong></p><p>The Rolltop's suspended neoprene device sleeve fits a 15” Macbook Pro or smaller. Larger laptops may fit inside the bag itself, but would need their own case. If in doubt, drop us a line and we'll help you figure it out! </p><p><strong>Will you be offering other colours?</strong></p><p>Right now, we don't have plans to release a new colour during the campaign. Introducing colours introduces operational complexity and as always, our absolute priority is hitting our delivery deadline. We're constantly evaluating options and if we get to a point where the complexity doesn't risk derailing the timeline, we'll consider colours again. </p><p><strong>Where are these bags made?</strong></p><p>They're designed in New Zealand and on the road, and built in Vietnam, using high-end components from Germany, Taiwan, and the United States, among others. </p><p><strong>Will these bags fit my height/build?</strong></p><p>The adjustable harness (of the Rolltop) and strap (of the Crossbody) are designed to fit a wide range of people. In some of the photos further up the page, we've added captions showing the height and weight of the model. That should give you an idea, but message us if you have any doubts! </p><p><strong>Do you offer bulk discounts?</strong></p><p>Yes! We're fully set up to accommodate bulk orders. If you're interested, get in touch with us directly at feedback [at] minaal [dot] com. </p><h1>Shipping</h1><p><strong>Which countries do you ship to?</strong></p><p>In addition to a US-based warehouse for US orders, we ship worldwide via various carriers from our international distribution hub in Hong Kong. </p><p><strong>When will I receive my gear?</strong></p><p>We're aiming to ship all Indiegogo rewards <em>before the end of November</em>. We'll be using a variety of carriers to reach different parts of the world — once your gear has shipped, we'll send you a tracking number. </p><p><strong>How did you decide on your estimated delivery date?</strong></p><p>Some campaigns set unrealistically short delivery dates to attract more sales. We never make compromises on design, manufacturing or fulfillment in order to rush a delivery date. Our bags are slow-cooked, carefully tested for quality, and only dished up to you when they're ready. Our two previous crowdfunding campaigns <strong>met or beat their delivery deadlines </strong>after that same process.</p><h1>Customs</h1><p><strong>Will there be any delays/fees?</strong></p><p>Crowdfunding campaigns regularly fulfill orders worldwide, and we've done it twice ourselves. In saying that, we don't claim to have intimate customs knowledge of the entire world. <em>We can't guarantee you won't experience delays or be charged import duties.</em> We <em>will</em> do everything we possible can, however, to minimise the risk of this happening. </p><h1>Returns</h1><p><strong>Do you offer them?</strong></p><p>We don't offer Change-of-Mind returns on Indiegogo perks. At its core, Indiegogo is about backing ambitious projects and helping them get off the ground <em>before they're fully formed</em>. In return, backers get a pre-sale price. However – you ARE able to cancel your pledge <em>at any point until your reward is shipped. </em></p><h1><strong>Lifetime warranty </strong></h1><p><strong>Do you provide one?</strong></p><p>Absolutely! All our gear comes with a lifetime warranty against defects — and these bags are no exception. </p><h1><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></h1><p><strong>I already have a Carry-on 2.0 and Daily. Do I need these new bags?</strong></p><p>The Carry-on 2.0 and Daily are built primarily for travellers who need to stay professional on the move. The Rolltop and Crossbody have similar capabilities, but an even more streamlined feel: they're more compact, and ideal for day-to-day situations where all you need are your essentials.</p><p><strong>How can I get these delivered to someone as a gift?</strong></p><p>Yes!

You want to carry less, and carry it well.
You prefer to stay light on your feet. 
You handle a wide range of situations every day and need a bag that keeps you flexible.
You need super-quick access to your essentials, at all times. 
You crave tools that boost your speed instead of slowing you down with unnecessary straps and buckles.
You value precision-engineered, life-proof components and construction.
  When we first dreamed up Minaal in the hazy days of 2007, our focus was on making thoughtful, reliable bags for long-haul travel. We figured: “even if nobody else likes these, at least we'll have our ultimate bag to use forever.” But some people did like them. Here's what they said:  Making the best bags for long-haul, carry-on travel is still at the core of our mission. But as the years passed, we also noticed a serious lack of options for people whose goal isn't always “fit the most possible stuff into a carry-on bag.”We heard repeatedly from people who prefer to pack light, stay flexible, and glide effortlessly through crowded spaces.You told us you were frustrated with the existing options. You were stuck with your unwieldy satchel. Or your fashionable but flimsy tote bag. Or that ugly yet disconcertingly seductive fanny pack from the 80s.You wanted something that offered the same quality and qualities as our existing gear — the same high-end components and emphasis on efficient movement. But you wanted it to be designed specifically for frequent access, whether on a cycle commute or a long-haul flight.You asked for bags that would help you organise your essentials, stay agile, and move as efficiently as possible from A to B.We listened. And we made those bags. 
 Compact. Convenient. The Minaal Rolltop is a compact bag for everyday use, and it also functions as a streamlined, easy-access bag for long-haul journeys. It's particularly ideal for short sprints where speed and convenience are your top priorities. It helps you stay burden-free and efficient as you glide from airport to café to meeting and back again.Whether you’re cycling to work with your laptop, or cutting through crowds at rush hour, you need a bag that keeps the journey smooth. The Rolltop’s classic top-loading design — combined with its unique quick-access, full-length front zipper, and multiple stash pockets — keep your gear accessible on the move.As well as taking care of your stuff, the Rolltop takes care of you: the EVA foam straps, padded carry handle, and custom-molded foam back panel make every step (or pedal) that little bit easier. At 15L, the Rolltop packs surprising capacity into a minimalist silhouette. It carries up to a 15” device in a protective, suspended neoprene sleeve; its backpack straps can be hidden at a moment's notice; and its integrated secret pockets keep your wallet or passport safe in transit. 
 Ben's height: 190cm / 6'3"" || Ben's weight: 79kg / 175lb
 Eva's height: 157cm / 5'2"" || Eva's weight: 50kg / 110lb
 The Rolltop's neoprene device sleeve is suspended away from the edges of the bag, protecting your laptop from drops.
 When you need a little more formality, hide the harness in a few seconds...
 ...and transition to your Rolltop's ultra-comfy EVA-foam handle.
 Want to access your tools on the move? No need to unroll the top flap...
 ...but the hidden pockets are there whenever you want to prioritise security.
 The German-engineered, secure magnetic fasteners of the rolltop entry complement a full-length front zip and two stash pockets – each with its own nested, secure pocket within.
 A bag designed for your essentials... with room for some cheeky extras.
 
  Instant access, zero bulk.The Minaal Crossbody is built for speed and flexibility. It gives you instant access to the tools you need — no matter where your day takes you.It's the bag for situations where you don't want to wear a bag. It's for cycling, snowsports, crowded trams, music festivals, exploring a hilly city on a hot day, and meandering along the beach at sunset with your favourite dog or fellow human.As well as being an urban 'go' bag, the 2L Crossbody functions as an ultra-portable cabin bag on flights, giving you easier access to your gear and a sneaky amount of extra capacity. After all, when's the last time you saw a gate agent weigh a crossbody bag?  The Crossbody is the ultimate in hands-free accessibility, with the flexibility to wear across your chest or back, and plenty of internal organisation to keep your smalls on lock (yes that is a new phrase, and yes you may use it ironically). 
 Eva's height: 157cm / 5'2"" || Eva's weight: 50kg / 110lb
 Ben's height: 190cm / 6'3"" || Ben's weight: 79kg / 175lb
 The accessibility and ultralight carry weight of the Crossbody set it apart from backpacks, duffels, and totes.
 The Crossbody’s internal organisation lets you access your essentials quickly and efficiently. What fits inside the Crossbody? Here are a few examples:
Kindle Paperwhite ✓ 
Sony A7 mirrorless camera ✓ 
iPhone XR ✓ 
iPhone X ✓ 
Samsung Galaxy S9+ ✓ 
Samsung Galaxy S10 ✓ 
Google Pixel 3 XL ✓ 
Passport ✓ 
Large banana (within reason — don't sue us when you hear about the Rhino Horn Plantain) ✓
Stretch-fabric connection wings give you a better fit, and the Crossbody's position and size help avoid the uncomfortable sweat that backpacks can cause.
 Eva's height: 157cm / 5'2"" || Eva's weight: 50kg / 110lb
 Keep your valuables safely within your field of vision in crowded spaces, and use the secret pocket for your credit cards, cash, or keys.
 What fits inside the Crossbody's secret pocket?
Credit cards ✓
Cash ✓
Keys (within reason, c'mon guys) ✓
USB sticks ✓
Personal items ✓
Very personal items ✓ (we think?!)
Diamonds ✓
The custom-molded foam back panel balances durability with soft handfeel, and the quality of the other components — including a magnetic quick-release buckle — mean the Crossbody will be with you for a lifetime.
   Why we started MinaalIn 2007, when we first got excited about the vague idea of “starting a travel gear company,” we didn't really know what that meant. We had weird, non-travel-related jobs. We kept blowing any money we saved — on trips to Vietnam and Paraguay. We didn't even have a garage that could later feature in the story of our humble beginnings.We just knew one thing. We couldn't find a professional-looking backpack specifically tailored to long-haul, minimalist, one-bag travel. All the existing options were either the wrong size, too suitcase-y, or simply not durable enough to go the distance.The original Minaal Carry-on — which we launched in 2013 — was an attempt to change that status quo and kick off a Travel Revolution (albeit a bloodless one).  The support you gave us during our first crowdfunding campaign — and the incredible amount of discerning feedback and detailed feature requests you've given us since — is what allowed us to keep fighting the War on Dangle and continue making thoughtful, carefully-crafted gear.Listening to you over the years has also helped us define who we are, why we're here, and what it should mean to be part of the Minaal community. It helped us realise things like:1) You can be “at home” everywhere. We're making tools for a world where people change locations, jobs, cities – and countries – at will.2) Great products put the user first, second, and third. We prioritise the experience of actually using our products. We have no outside investors or arbitrary fashion cycles to please. If it's not a joy to use, we won't release it – because we won't use it ourselves.3) Quality saves money – and the environment. We live in a world where products are increasingly disposable. We make tools that are indispensable, not disposable.  Both from a financial and environmental perspective, the least expensive bag is the one you use the longest.How we designed these bags Not all buckles are created equal. The less equal ones, Jimmy cruelly ignores. We only ever make gear that we think will be genuinely useful in a way that we — and others — actually care about.For that reason, every single one of our designs starts with listening. It often takes several years of listening — and asking questions, and testing out ideas — to be sure we're onto something. The design process for the Rolltop and Crossbody began in 2017. Since then we've been endlessly brainstorming, sketching, prototyping, and causing thousands of people around the world to wonder why New Zealanders compulsively touch the bags of passersby (it's called fabric research, Steve, and that restraining order was really uncalled for). Here are a few visuals of that process:A CNC machine crafts a buckle mold. The water injection is to prevent us from being engulfed in flames. Thank you, water.
 Strength testing. Some sources report that Doug was scared by the noise and Jimmy wasn’t.
 If anyone needs any high-end drill bits, call Doug on [number redacted]!
 Buckle Mordor.
At last, we've created prototypes that we're very, very excited about. This is a behind-the-scenes shot of us filming the video. See also: flagrant topknot. To repeat what we said during our last campaign: if you jump on this Indiegogo project, you're part of the family. We want to hear from you in good times and bad. We want to hear what you're up to, where you're headed, and we want to design gear that you want to carry.  (If you can't read Japanese, and you're not currently sitting next to a helpful Japanese stranger, feel free to skip the following section.)For our friends in Japan:日々の生活や旅行中でもモノに縛られず、行きたい場所に行き、会いたい人に会う   日本のバッグ愛好家の皆さん、こんにちわ！ Minaal創業者の一人であるJimmyは2年間前に生活の拠点を東京に移し、企画段階から常に日本のことを視野に入れながら今回のバッグのデザインを進めてきました。毎日よく移動する人、混雑した電車での通勤をする人、PCを持ってカフェに通う人、休みは国内を旅する人、海外出張が多い人、または他拠点生活をしている人・・。 日本の多様なライフスタイルが、新しいバッグへのアイデアを生み出してくれました。  
荷物はより少ないものだけを、より賢く持ち歩きたい人
「Less is More」という生き方に共感できる人
移動が多く、どんな混雑した状況でも邪魔にならないバッグが必要な人
暮らすように旅をしている人
パソコン等の必需品に早く簡単にアクセスできるバッグを探している人
デザインと耐久性のバランスを求める人
 より早く、よりミニマルに動きたいあなたに愛用してもらえることを願い、私達はこのバッグを作りました。 共感いただける方は、是非このプロジェクトに参加してもらえると嬉しいです。今あなたがいる場所と、次の目的地との距離が少しでも近づきますように。  Minaal ロールトップ

 In our most recent crowdfunding campaign three years ago, we attracted (and fell just a little in love with) nearly 2,500 backers from 66 countries. Despite shipping to far-flung regions like Nokia, Finland, and Mosgiel, New Zealand, we fulfilled the campaign on time (or in many cases, ahead of schedule).That said, please be aware: we put a huge amount of energy and care into the design, manufacturing and fulfillment processes, and would never compromise on quality just to beat a delivery date.We plan on shipping all Indiegogo rewards by the end of November 2019.After delivering multiple crowdfunding campaigns on-time, we're fully set up to accommodate large orders. So if you'd like to get your hands on 10+ bags — for your company swag, or your bag-loving Sicilian dynasty — we can make that happen. Message us for details!We can't emphasise enough how ridiculously helpful people have been since we set out. To our previous backers, our users, our friends, and everyone else we nagged for advice or support along the way — THANK YOU.It's worth saying again: we care a lot – like, possibly an unhealthy amount – about your experience using the tools we make. These bags were borne from the generous, extensive feedback we received from many of you over the years. We designed them to last for as long as humanly possible. “Planned obsolescence” is really not our jam.Real talk: there are alternatives out there, many of them good. If they suit your life or your use case better, we'd be stoked to hear you've found a perfect fit. For us, this isn't about making sales at any cost. It's about making bags that we love using so much, we're compelled to share them with other people.For us, minimalism isn't just about having fewer things. It's about having the right things. And remember – the cheapest bag, the one that's least draining on the environment? It's the one you use the longest.   Still have questions? Check out our FAQ below. FAQ-----ProductWhat are the bags' weights & dimensions?Here are the provisional specs. For more info, check out the 'key features' graphics further up the page.Rolltop: 
Weight = 890g / 1.96lb
Dimensions = 32 x 12 x 48cm / 12.6 x 4.7 x 18.9in (rolled)
Crossbody: 
Weight = 290g / 0.65lb
Dimensions = 30 x 5 x 15cm / 11.8 x 2 x 5.9in
Will the Rolltop fit my laptop/tablet?The Rolltop's suspended neoprene device sleeve fits a 15” Macbook Pro or smaller. Larger laptops may fit inside the bag itself, but would need their own case. If in doubt, drop us a line and we'll help you figure it out! Will you be offering other colours?Right now, we don't have plans to release a new colour during the campaign. Introducing colours introduces operational complexity and as always, our absolute priority is hitting our delivery deadline. We're constantly evaluating options and if we get to a point where the complexity doesn't risk derailing the timeline, we'll consider colours again. Where are these bags made?They're designed in New Zealand and on the road, and built in Vietnam, using high-end components from Germany, Taiwan, and the United States, among others. Will these bags fit my height/build?The adjustable harness (of the Rolltop) and strap (of the Crossbody) are designed to fit a wide range of people. In some of the photos further up the page, we've added captions showing the height and weight of the model. That should give you an idea, but message us if you have any doubts! Do you offer bulk discounts?Yes! We're fully set up to accommodate bulk orders. If you're interested, get in touch with us directly at feedback [at] minaal [dot] com. ShippingWhich countries do you ship to?In addition to a US-based warehouse for US orders, we ship worldwide via various carriers from our international distribution hub in Hong Kong. When will I receive my gear?We're aiming to ship all Indiegogo rewards before the end of November. We'll be using a variety of carriers to reach different parts of the world — once your gear has shipped, we'll send you a tracking number. How did you decide on your estimated delivery date?Some campaigns set unrealistically short delivery dates to attract more sales. We never make compromises on design, manufacturing or fulfillment in order to rush a delivery date. Our bags are slow-cooked, carefully tested for quality, and only dished up to you when they're ready. Our two previous crowdfunding campaigns met or beat their delivery deadlines after that same process.CustomsWill there be any delays/fees?Crowdfunding campaigns regularly fulfill orders worldwide, and we've done it twice ourselves. In saying that, we don't claim to have intimate customs knowledge of the entire world. We can't guarantee you won't experience delays or be charged import duties. We will do everything we possible can, however, to minimise the risk of this happening. ReturnsDo you offer them?We don't offer Change-of-Mind returns on Indiegogo perks. At its core, Indiegogo is about backing ambitious projects and helping them get off the ground before they're fully formed. In return, backers get a pre-sale price. However – you ARE able to cancel your pledge at any point until your reward is shipped. Lifetime warranty Do you provide one?Absolutely! All our gear comes with a lifetime warranty against defects — and these bags are no exception. MiscellaneousI already have a Carry-on 2.0 and Daily. Do I need these new bags?The Carry-on 2.0 and Daily are built primarily for travellers who need to stay professional on the move. The Rolltop and Crossbody have similar capabilities, but an even more streamlined feel: they're more compact, and ideal for day-to-day situations where all you need are your essentials.How can I get these delivered to someone as a gift?Yes! It's just a matter of submitting the right shipping address. If in doubt, message us so we can work out the specifics.  I'm travelling, can I send my bag(s) to X destination?Sure, just drop us a line and we can figure something out :)Is the Crossbody essentially a new-age fanny pack? Yes, also known in parts of the Southern Hemisphere as a bum bag.Who — or what — is Minaal? We started off as two guys from New Zealand — with no real business credentials or manufacturing experience whatsoever — who were frustrated by the lack of great travel bags. So, in 2013, we launched a crowdfunding campaign with the aim of making that bag. Thanks to you — our incredible backers — our original Carry-on took off. Since then, we've been building a company dedicated to creating gear that makes you feel at home everywhere. If life is “a brief crack of light between two eternities of darkness,” why bother backing your Indiegogo campaign?Email us.",80.0,0,"1 Campaign

Take a minute to name all of the brands you can think of that make sunglasses for an active lifestyle. There’s a good chance that every single brand you named uses either CR-39 or polycarbonate lenses. Although eighty percent of the world’s shades feature these lens materials, they are deeply flawed. Polycarbonate lenses are durable but, due to being injection molded, feature inconsistencies that create significant optical distortion. Despite having good optical properties, CR-39 is especially brittle and offers extremely poor impact resistance.</p><div data-id=""19342055""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1512162505/p9ozsoyfq8jukll6tyad.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p>Rather than embracing the status quo, we moved beyond it.

Whether through their frame design, lens quality, or the materials they use, ordinary shades sacrifice performance to enhance style or make an extra buck. Simply put, the technology found in the world’s best optics has not been available in shades built for life in motion—until now.After struggling to find sunglasses that truly met our needs, we created them. Our Shred Boost sunglasses offer unrivaled clarity, contrast, and performance in optics built to endure the great outdoors. Made in Italy and paired with the finest lenses from Japan, these shades showcase a crisp appearance and unparalleled craftsmanship. With your help, we stand to create a new standard in optics, blending premium technology with designs that are as stylish as they are durable. Our passion runs deep—and so does our experience. Shred is the brainchild of Ted Ligety and Carlo Salmini. In addition to snagging two Olympic gold medals in alpine skiing, Ted is a five-time World Champ. Carlo is a materials engineer, avid skier and biker, and a graduate of the MIT Sloan School of Management. Throughout the past ten years, Ted and Carlo have attained a slew of patents for Shred’s helmets, goggles, and protective gear. These products have also earned no shortage of accolades and a loyal following among fans and athletes.         Stop. Take a minute to name all of the brands you can think of that make sunglasses for an active lifestyle. There’s a good chance that every single brand you named uses either CR-39 or polycarbonate lenses. Although eighty percent of the world’s shades feature these lens materials, they are deeply flawed. Polycarbonate lenses are durable but, due to being injection molded, feature inconsistencies that create significant optical distortion. Despite having good optical properties, CR-39 is especially brittle and offers extremely poor impact resistance.Rather than embracing the status quo, we moved beyond it. In lieu of polycarbonate or CR-39 lenses, we use liquid-cast urethane lenses of the highest optical grade, which also offer the best impact resistance and durability. By liquid casting our lenses in glass molds, we ensure they’re free of distortion. In addition to offering crystal clear vision, urethane lenses are exceptionally light and provide excellent scratch and shatter resistance. Rather than making compromises, our lenses offer unrivaled performance.The use of these lenses places us in elite company. Shred and a handful of other brands use high-grade urethane. These other brands are synonymous with excellence in optic precision and quality. Yet none of these other brands has applied this technology to products designed for an active lifestyle. We’re addressing this need, crafting frames that deliver fresh style and plenty of performance while also featuring some of the finest lenses in the world. It wasn’t enough to make our lenses free of distortion. We also wanted them to enhance image definition, contrast, and the vividness of colors. Driven by this desire, we created our Contrast Boosting Lens (CBL) technology.For the CBL technology used in our sunglasses, we developed a dye that is optimized for compatibility and performance with the high-grade urethane used to make our lenses. Especially versatile, this lens tint makes specific color ranges warmer and richer to ensure our sunglasses can truly handle all terrain and conditions.By making the colors and details that truly matter pop, our lenses amplify your experience and enable you to see nuances that would otherwise escape detection with a traditional lens. This stands to boost your confidence, safety, and ability to enjoy the moment. Thanks to CBL, you can see more—and see better.One of the greatest ways to improve the comfort of a pair of sunglasses is to reduce its weight. Guided by this belief, we designed our NoWeight frames to be especially light. These frames use minimal material while maximizing stability and performance.The exterior of our frames provides a clean, streamlined appearance while on the frame’s interior sides, we’ve reduced the material used in areas subject to minimal stress and reinforced target areas for maximum durability. This significantly reduces the weight of our frames, and allows them to be extremely thin and flexible.And to lessen CO2 emissions, we make our frames with a specially formulated polyamide that is partially bio-based, as fifty-four percent of this polymer’s raw material comes from renewable resources (measured in accordance with the ASTM D6866 standard).GRIP-ON™ pads on the nose and temple tips further enhance comfort and ensure the frames stay in place while you’re in motion. We offer our Shred Boost sunglasses in three frame designs:Armed with a timeless style, the Belushki is at ease on the peaks and in the streets. This design features accents on the front of the frame and lenses with a base six curve, which provide a flatter look. Bold and confident, the Provocator cradles the contours of your face for a fresh blend of style and performance. Its base eight curve lenses provide the frames with a wrap-around design, offering a streamlined appearance and additional protection. We also offer the Provocator Airflow, which incorporates a thin vent into the outer edge of each lens to maximize ventilation. This design prevents the lenses from fogging when you’re especially active. The Provocator Airflow features CBL lenses and also comes with a bonus clear, non-CBL lens. With a slightly larger lens and frame than the Belushki, the Stomp infuses a classic design with modern performance. Its base six curve lenses provide the frame with a flatter appearance. We offer a range of lens treatments to better meet your needs—and budget. Each model is available in polarized and non-polarized versions, as well as with mirrored and non-mirrored lenses. And for a crisp appearance and timeless style, all of our sunglasses sport matte black frames. Shred polarized lenses filter out scattered and reflected light to minimize glare while further enhancing contrast and your ability to perceive color. This stands to improve comfort by reducing strain on your eyes—even during the brightest days of summer. For those searching for additional style, mirrored lenses provide an appearance that’s both bold and timeless. To help ensure that their clarity stands the test of time, all of our lenses feature a permanent oleo and hydrophobic protective treatment on the inside of the lens to make its surface water and grease repellent. We’ve spent the past several years testing and refining our Shred Boost sunglasses. In addition to leveraging our knowledge and expertise, we’ve tapped a vast network of friends and team riders to ensure our shades reach their full potential. Today, we’re turning to you and the Indiegogo community to help fuel innovation and bring these shades to market.

<p>As with any manufacturing, there are always small risks. The biggest concerns we can foresee are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Timing - while we have worked through a timeline with our factory, there is always the potential for unknowns to cause delays. We have built in a bit of a buffer though, so this should not be an issue.</li>
<li>Overall Quality - While we have had great success working with this manufacturer so far, and they are true craftsmen when it comes to footwear, there is always the risk of quality in the production of any product.
