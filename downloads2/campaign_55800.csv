<h3>                       The SPEED SECRET Story:</h3>
<p>My name is Jim Warren and I am an Internationally certified MASTER TRAINER and former D-1 and Professional athlete. My passion is for helping others achieve their athletic goals and dreams by <b>making them faster.</b></p>
<p>After 30+ years working with elite athletes all over the world and in every major sport, I have distilled the coaching down to a <b>few manageable, concise drills</b> that create the greatest impact in the shortest time period possible. Most videos and camps or clinics address the challenge through the eyes of Professional or Collegiate time-tables: 2-4 hours a day, 5-6 days a week. But most kids are so smashed by their team schedule they only have an extra 45 minutes 2-3 times a week! <b>The SPEED SECRET is designed specifically for the time-constrained kid and coach</b>.</p>
<p>My company, Sports Performance TECHNOLOGIES, has a motto for our SPEED SECRET system, and our camps/clinics and seminars:</p>
<p>                                              <b> SPEED CHANGES EVERYTHING</b>!</p>
<p>I believe that by coming alongside young athletes and <b>improving their movements quickly and concisely </b>they can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enjoy sports by being more competitive</li>
<li>Be protected from injuries by moving better and having better body-awareness.</li>
<li>Catch the eye of coaches more quickly than kids who might be bigger or more skilled.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The SPEED SECRET</b> is 1.)  <b>7 videos</b> of my coaching, chalk board explanations and visual clues, 2.) a <b>group of PDFs</b> that are goal sheets to help kids figure out where they are headed and testing forms so they can see their progress and create a goal path and 3.) <b>Seminar Notes in PDF form</b> which allow a Mom or Dad or Coach to follow along and make notes for coaching on the field. 4.) <strong>Quizzes</strong> designed to keep you on track and focused on retaining the 'Big Rocks'.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>                    What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The 'box' and the systems that support it are all finished but we now need funding for the final processes: Website polish (thespeedsecret.com), final video edits, and general 'stuff' for TEAM members: T-shirts, hats etc...</p>
<p>What we will do:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are raising $5000 to cover all final expenses and go to market:</li>
<li>Final creation and integration of the delivery platform: INFUSIONSOFT, Memberium, LearnDash and other APS that make the process seamless.</li>
<li>Peripheral inventories (hats, shirts, socks and custom jackets)</li>
</ul>
<p>What you will get:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>The Videos</b> are just like we teach in our camps or clinics: some white board teaching that explains how the body works and WHY kids need to learn it: Young athletes today are different from when I was an athlete. It's not as simple as 'do as I say'. <u>They need to see and then decide</u> 'That makes perfect sense!' or they will only buy in 50%. The videos also contain all our drills explained in detail so you will feel confident to teach outside. You will continue to hear me say 'in real time' because changing an athletes patterns must be done instantly, consistently, and immediately and they will buy in 100%!</li>
<li>
<b>The PDFs </b>are a guide to use along the journey. They create order to the process and allow the Coach to stay on track and put all the exercises (Proper warm-up, Explosive drills, Running volumes, strength drills, and Restoratives) in the right place and allow the young athlete to play a role in their development: written goals, recorded times and distances, and the creation of a visual time-table so they don't fall prey to the soul-crusher of young athletes: panic and short-term pressure.</li>
<li>
<b>The Quizzes </b>are a simple way to make sure that you 'get it'. Only 10 questions per quiz, and <u>the answers are right on the PDFs accompanying the vids</u>. Simple<b>. </b>Think about it:<b>  </b><b>           If LADDERS, WIND-SPRINTS AND PARACHUTES REALLY WORKED,                                                        wouldn't all the kids be faster?</b>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This campaign is more than making kids faster or making more money. I can make more money in a week consulting than I make in a month training kids. But as a former chubby, slow, and picked on kid, I know what it means to start to turn the corner athletically: I was a 5' 104# as a freshman and 5'2"" 120# as a sophomore, and my NFL dreams looked pretty bleak. But in the spring of my Sophomore year I set the low hurdle record at my High School and <b>suddenly the coaches had to take a second look at me. </b></p>
<p><b>                              Suddenly <u>I was fast and the coaches took notice.</u> </b></p>
<p>When we built the CENTER 4 CHAMPIONS we didn't know what the result would be and now we have dozens and dozens of awesome kids and parents <b>driving 30-60-90 minutes each way to give their kids the opportunity to train with us</b>. What if that opportunity could suddenly be made available to kids in places where there is no Jim Warren or speed coach or CENTER 4 CHAMPIONS?</p>
<p>My long term goal is that The SPEED SECRET will be a certification process adopted by trainers around the world and kids will impacted everywhere. <b>But it starts with this Indiegogo campaign and you can be part of something cool right now. </b></p>

<h3>Whole Worship, Complete Surrender</h3> Throughout my years of practicing yoga, my heart and mind were always on The Lord, but in a silent manner. I often found myself in this profoundly intimate and worshipful experience with Christ. I found my movement becoming more like 'Prayers In Motion', flowing in His grace. A few years ago, God called me out to share <i>whole worship</i> and <i>complete surrender</i> with others. (<a href=""http://yogafaith.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">YogaFaith</a> is proud to be one of the only Christian Schools internationally accredited by the Yoga Alliance) No longer silent while <i>praying in motion</i>, literally stretching one's faith, is the most wonderful experience and difficult to describe. With worship music, and a few Hallelujah's, this is our highest praise to Him, with our whole body, mind, spirit and soul, we are simply praising God! I long to share what whole worship and complete surrender truly is with the World and I pray that you can help me!</span></div><div>

<div>   <h3>Prayers in Motion </h3>
<i> Stretching Your Faith</i> helps others draw closer to the heart of the God. As Christ followers there is nothing more important than to hear what God wants to speak into our lives. With over 400 pages of illustrations, personal stories and hundreds of scriptures, this book is a spirit led blueprint to finding stillness in our busy lives, calming the chaos, and most importantly, hearing God's still small voice in an extremely loud world. It is also our dedication and devotion to Him as we move and worship God with our entire being. There are many postures of prayer throughout The Bible. <i>Stretching Your Faith</i> will guide you through biblical principles and postures to redeem what The Word declares: that we should meditate daily, worship with our whole being and love Him with all our heart, with all our breath, with all our strength and with all our mind. (See Acts 17:28)</div>

I have practiced and studied yoga for over 20 years and have trained many students and instructors. I have traveled to many third world countries and taught YogaFaith to human traffick survivors. YogaFaith classes are donation only with 100% of these funds going directly to help trafficked survivors around the world. I am an active advocate for these precious souls and do all that I can to restore and redeem their lives. 
Stretching Your Faith is a project born out of my passion for Christ and yoga. I have been writing for many years and now pray to share the practice with the rest of the world. There will also be a section in this book that will spread awareness and allow others to participate in the rescue, healing and restoration of traffick survivors. I thank you in advance for helping me launch this vital project.

-Patrick
Snow, Publishing Coach and International Best-Selling Author of
Creating
Your Own Destiny
Whole Worship, Complete Surrender Throughout my years of practicing yoga, my heart and mind were always on The Lord, but in a silent manner. I often found myself in this profoundly intimate and worshipful experience with Christ. I found my movement becoming more like 'Prayers In Motion', flowing in His grace. A few years ago, God called me out to share whole worship and complete surrender with others. (YogaFaith is proud to be one of the only Christian Schools internationally accredited by the Yoga Alliance) No longer silent while praying in motion, literally stretching one's faith, is the most wonderful experience and difficult to describe. With worship music, and a few Hallelujah's, this is our highest praise to Him, with our whole body, mind, spirit and soul, we are simply praising God! I long to share what whole worship and complete surrender truly is with the World and I pray that you can help me!
                                            
   Prayers in Motion 
 Stretching Your Faith helps others draw closer to the heart of the God. As Christ followers there is nothing more important than to hear what God wants to speak into our lives. With over 400 pages of illustrations, personal stories and hundreds of scriptures, this book is a spirit led blueprint to finding stillness in our busy lives, calming the chaos, and most importantly, hearing God's still small voice in an extremely loud world. It is also our dedication and devotion to Him as we move and worship God with our entire being. There are many postures of prayer throughout The Bible. Stretching Your Faith will guide you through biblical principles and postures to redeem what The Word declares: that we should meditate daily, worship with our whole being and love Him with all our heart, with all our breath, with all our strength and with all our mind. (See Acts 17:28)
   ""Yoga
Faith brings great synchronization between spirit, mind, body and
soul. You will find yourself immersed spiritually as well as
physically. Michelle Thielen is an amazing woman of God and Yoga
teacher. She has great passion to propel the Kingdom of God as she
boldly lives out her God-inspired life.""

</div></div>","What is Puzzle Splint?

""Accidents can be happen anytime and anywhere"". It's can happen in at your home, in the streets, public space, or even when you 're exercising or sports. How if an accident happens to you or your family and causing an injury to the limb (bone fracture or dislocation)? If that happens the first thing you need to do is immobilized that injury with splint.  But as we all know, the ordinary splint, has so many limitations. Each part has a lot of size & shape, so we need to adjust depend on the location and type of injury. This will slowing the installation of splints and makes it impractical during transport. Besides that, ordinary splints also not suitable for X - ray , CT scan , or MRI because of their basic material.

The diference between Puzzle Splint® with ordinary / conventional splint.
Ordinary splints are generally made from hard materials such as: metal, hard plate, plastic fiber or etc, sometimes it's can not be penetrated by X-rays. Puzzle splint is using wood (block board) that are environmentally friendly and of course wood material is can be easily penetrated by X-rays. So when the X-ray procedures performed we did not need to remove the splint. Other material is a sponge and synthetic leather. So that it can be used repeatedly, saving costs, and remain comfortable during use.


Puzzle Splint® is recommended for:

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""text-align: center; background-color: initial;"">The purpose of this campaign is to raise funds to convert a section of our existing facility into a recreational area for our youth to enjoy on a daily basis as a part of their recovery.

<p>There are very little recreational options for youth (ages 15-30) in recovery after they complete a treatment

free from stigma and judgement that those with addiction and mental health

</div><div>     </div><div>     </div><div><br/></div></div>","About Us:
The Reach Centre is a safe environment for youth across Prince Edward Island who are recovering from addiction(s) and mental health issues. Staff at the centre provide daily counselling and help clients to access additional community resources, and youth are able to connect with others who are undergoing their own journey of recovery. 
We focus on continual education and reintegration into the workplace after treatment, promote healthy life style changes, and provide recreational activities to reduce relapse and ensure a smooth transition back into society. 
Purpose:
The purpose of this campaign is to raise funds to convert a section of our existing facility into a recreational area for our youth to enjoy on a daily basis as a part of their recovery. Most youth in recovery find it difficult to engage in recreational activities at public facilities, due to the stigma surrounding addiction and mental health issues. 
This project focuses on providing a recovery based space for our youth to improve on their physical health and life skills, while engaging in a safe social setting with multiple activities, and multiple resources to stay connected and to remain involved with our services offered at the Reach Centre. Your support of this project, means so much to many of our Island  youth.
It's a win win for the both of us:
Funds raised from this campaign will be used to outfit a section of our existing facility with a gym, complete with fitness equipment. All monies raised through Indiegogo will be immediately put towards the purchasing of equipment, mat flooring, sanitation supplies, towels, and a stereo system! 
You have the gratification of knowing that you helped many of our Island youth, while on their path to recovery, along with receiving recognition of some awesome perks when you  donate.
Donations are accepted at only ten ($10.00) dollars! Charitable receipts provided upon request.
The Impact:
  
There are very little recreational options for youth (ages 15-30) in recovery after they complete a treatment
program on Prince Edward Island, and this often contributes to relapse.The Reach Centre aids youth in recovery by providing an environment
free from stigma and judgement that those with addiction and mental health
issues so often face. 
The Reach Centre is growing steadily as we offer multiple programs
for our youth and their families. Our programs, initiatives, workshops, counselling  and supports have  helped  numerous youth achieve additional educational, employment goals,and maintain a happy, healthy life style. 
By introducing  and expanding our recreational program with a fully equipped gym, the number of youth accessing our services will grow significantly, extending additional ways to encourage our youth in recovery who no longer feel isolated and judged, relying on Reach staff and our volunteers to help with any issues that they may experience so they can maintain
their sobriety.


Your help is welcomed in many ways:

Additional ways in which you may help our campaign and the Reach Centre include:

<p><strong>Hi my name is Oreet </strong>– Spending summers with Israeli-Yemenite grandparents gave me a deep connection with bellydance. My passion for music established as a classical pianist as a youth and then translated on to become a professional modern dancer &amp; fitness instructor in NYC.</p>
<p>Creating SharQuí allowed a professional fusion with my family roots – in a dance that bears one's soul. It is my life’s work to expand the SHAKE YOUR BEAUTY™ movement to everyday people across the globe!</p>
<p>To love oneself is to experience one of the greatest loves of all. Bellydance for centuries has promoted this self-love and embracing every curve across cultural division and regional territories. Most do not learn to love one's curves and SharQuí - the bellydance workout® encompasses that self-love in modern day life.  No matter your background – we can ALL come together through dance! SharQuí crew provides the space, venue, and skills to express this act of self-love in a unifying community.</p>
<p><br/><strong><u>Your Contribution </u></strong><strong><u>&amp; What You Get</u></strong><br/><br/>We call for $34,875 to further team hours + marketing to grow community outreach and education to impact everyday folks worldwide. The funds will contribute to participate in key conferences and events to best connect with community circles (both in person and online). SharQuí has grown organically &amp; external support is now essential to further spread our movement.</p>
<p>You will receive the STICKER, the CARD, the SHIRT, the BELLYDANCE WORKOUT, the PRIVATE LESSON, the MUSIC, the LUNCH, and/or the OREET PERFORMANCE!</p>
<p><br/>If we don’t reach our goal – we will continue to plug away on local levels. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>The Impact  </u></strong></p>
<p>Suzanne (with Lebanese heritage) and I will continue to spread our message of self-love &amp; unity through the SHAKE YOUR BEAUTY™ movement.  In 2017, the Joanne Domenici Memorial Award was given to <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/bwitchs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Leena Vaswani</a>, based in Mumbai, India and the runner-up <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/laura.petersen.9404?hc_ref=NEWSFEED"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Laura Petersen</a>, based in Dunlap, TN, USA giving tools &amp; opportunities to those passionate about the cause.  Read the short testimonials found below and <a href=""http://www.sharqui.com/testimonials/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> to see the results thus far:</p>
<p>“My life is richer in so many ways because SharQuí allows me to step out of the regular world and be a positive influence in other people’s lives; but a healthier me is the best reward of all!“ By Sandra Forrer</p>
<p>“The SharQuí method has really been just about the best thing that’s happened to me in my “quest” to get my mobility back. It’s so focused on building the strength and stamina in all the right muscle groups and hasn’t once felt like I was in danger of straining myself or aggravating my injury. Oreet is absolutely amazing for keeping us on track with our posture and the appropriate way to perform each move.  I’ve recommended SharQuí to all of my friends, to my family, and even to complete strangers in the gym.” By Rachel</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>Risks &amp; Challenges</u></strong><br/><br/>I have been a one woman show for a long time and now it’s time to ask for help – can you relate? Your support will give some wind to this sail. As a founder – my biggest challenge is believing you value our transparent &amp; purposeful goals. The risk is - is passionate honesty rewarded? Growing SharQuí this far clearly shows my genuine commitment, yet growth requires a bigger community.  <br/><br/><strong><u>Other Ways You Can Help</u></strong><br/><br/>If you can’t contribute – you can still help the SHAKE YOUR BEAUTY™ movement.

</div></div>","Hi my name is Oreet – Spending summers with Israeli-Yemenite grandparents gave me a deep connection with bellydance. My passion for music established as a classical pianist as a youth and then translated on to become a professional modern dancer & fitness instructor in NYC.
Creating SharQuí allowed a professional fusion with my family roots – in a dance that bears one's soul. It is my life’s work to expand the SHAKE YOUR BEAUTY™ movement to everyday people across the globe!
To love oneself is to experience one of the greatest loves of all. Bellydance for centuries has promoted this self-love and embracing every curve across cultural division and regional territories. Most do not learn to love one's curves and SharQuí - the bellydance workout® encompasses that self-love in modern day life.  No matter your background – we can ALL come together through dance! SharQuí crew provides the space, venue, and skills to express this act of self-love in a unifying community.
Your Contribution & What You GetWe call for $34,875 to further team hours + marketing to grow community outreach and education to impact everyday folks worldwide. The funds will contribute to participate in key conferences and events to best connect with community circles (both in person and online). SharQuí has grown organically & external support is now essential to further spread our movement.
You will receive the STICKER, the CARD, the SHIRT, the BELLYDANCE WORKOUT, the PRIVATE LESSON, the MUSIC, the LUNCH, and/or the OREET PERFORMANCE!
If we don’t reach our goal – we will continue to plug away on local levels. 
 
The Impact  
Suzanne (with Lebanese heritage) and I will continue to spread our message of self-love & unity through the SHAKE YOUR BEAUTY™ movement.  In 2017, the Joanne Domenici Memorial Award was given to Leena Vaswani, based in Mumbai, India and the runner-up Laura Petersen, based in Dunlap, TN, USA giving tools & opportunities to those passionate about the cause.  Read the short testimonials found below and here to see the results thus far:
“My life is richer in so many ways because SharQuí allows me to step out of the regular world and be a positive influence in other people’s lives; but a healthier me is the best reward of all!“ By Sandra Forrer
“The SharQuí method has really been just about the best thing that’s happened to me in my “quest” to get my mobility back. It’s so focused on building the strength and stamina in all the right muscle groups and hasn’t once felt like I was in danger of straining myself or aggravating my injury. Oreet is absolutely amazing for keeping us on track with our posture and the appropriate way to perform each move.  I’ve recommended SharQuí to all of my friends, to my family, and even to complete strangers in the gym.” By Rachel
 
Risks & ChallengesI have been a one woman show for a long time and now it’s time to ask for help – can you relate? Your support will give some wind to this sail. As a founder – my biggest challenge is believing you value our transparent & purposeful goals. The risk is - is passionate honesty rewarded? Growing SharQuí this far clearly shows my genuine commitment, yet growth requires a bigger community.  Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can’t contribute – you can still help the SHAKE YOUR BEAUTY™ movement. Much beauty and cross-cultural collaborations have come from the Middle East region – please share this positive message with the world!

Your BALSAQ® is Machine Washable. Simply remove  your balls from the SAQ before washing.  BALSAQ® is made with some of the industries most durable and antimicrobial materials.  Use cold water, no bleach and cool dry. 

To use: simply place your BALSAQ® on your area of tightness and roll!!
 
For best results, put your BALSAQ® against the wall, floor or other hard surface. Use your body to apply the amount of pressure necessary to get relief.  
 
• BALSAQ® is an easy to use, multi-functional mobility tool.  It optimizes the results of therapeutic mobility balls for trigger point therapy.
 
• BALSAQ® may assist in self-myofascial release, which activates trigger points in muscles and helps to relax tight areas.
 
Just a few ideas to get you moving...
 
 
 






 

BALSAQ® utilizes the most durable and comfortable material offered by the leading sportswear manufacturer. The construction is meticulously designed for the perfect fit and form around the massage balls, which eliminates creases and wrinkles when rolling. The handles allow for effortless control. 
 


BALSAQ® allows you to add variety and fun to your stretching and fitness routines. In addition to countless mobility and pressure point uses, the BALSAQ®  itself, acts as the perfect band. 
 










 


Our shared passion for fitness and wellness brought us together. Tired of chasing our balls……..we feverishly developed a solution . With our combined talents, we developed BALSAQ® the ULTIMATE MOBILITY SOLUTION . Simply load your balls in the BALSAQ® and you are ready to roll !!
We have a lot of fun, we still laugh about the name, and are continually finding new ways to use our BALSAQ®.  We know you will too ! 
 

- Can i get my BALSAQ® in time for Christmas ? 
Orders placed earliest in the campaign will have the greatest chance of arriving before Christmas. 
Can I get my BALSAQ® wet ?
Yes. We have used it in the pool, the sauna, and at the beach. 
- Can I wash my BALSAQ® ? 
Yes. It is machine washable :)) ....just make sure and take the balls out before you wash. Look for the yellow tag, for complete washing instructions. 
- Does my Balsaq come with instructions ? 
Yes. Each BALSAQ® has a tag, which includes suggestions and instructions.  However, you will quickly find your own way to use your BALSAQ® to meet your needs. 
-Can a Physical Therapist and a Chiropractor use the Balsaq® in their practice ? 
ABSOLUTELY!
 

 
 

 
Ready to ROLL!
All of the hard work is now behind us!  We have years of research & development; manufacturer sourcing and prototype refinement.  We've perfected the BALSAQ® and are confident and excited to offer them to you ! Our manufacturers are as proud of the results as we are and are on standby, ready to fill every order in as little time as possible.
 

Help ""Spread the Word!""
The public's response to the BALSAQ® has been overwhelmingly enthusiastic and positive. Please take a second to share the word about our campaign on social media.

<p>How often have you gone into a public restroom and had to touch either the soap dispenser or the faucet handle in order to wash your hands? You probably don't want to know what kinds of bacteria and organisms can potentially live on these surfaces that can pass from user to user.

Competition for manufacturing  breeds better pricing for the consumer which will increase this appliance's reach into a larger market. This fee will sustain the invention's current website for a year and  to allow us to use the contact list from a well-known patent marketing agency.</p>
<p>2. Expedited US Patent Office Filing Fee:  We are currently Patent-Pending. This expedited filing fee will get us to the front of the line for Utility Patent approval.

<p>3. Initial Corporate Filing Fees: This is to establish a corporate entity separate from the inventor for a period of one year.</p>
<p>4. PCT  Application Filing Fee. We eventually want to see this appliance globally manufactured and time is of the essence to capture foreign markets as well. This fee is a place holder for the U.S. Patent Office indicating an intention to file internationally.</p>

""Egg em on!"" - ChallengeHelp Fight the ""Silent Epidemic""Brain Injury is the leading cause of death and disability in children and young adults.  In Iowa there are more than 95,000 individuals with long term disability from brain injury.  We are the Brain Injury Alliance of Iowa.  
We were founded more than 30 years ago by Iowans with brain injury and their families.
We maintain a team of brain injury professionals who support thousands of Iowans with brain injury to navigate the medical and social complexities of brain injury to live well with, and recover from brain injury.  
We support prevention and awareness efforts statewide.  
We educate medical and disability professional on current and emerging medical and rehabilitation techniques.
We have support groups and  family and caregiver education programs.
We are a state and federally recognized, Iowa, non-profit, charity; have an active statewide board of director and an overhead of less than 15%
Why this fundraising challenge?  
Survival from, and awareness of, brain injury is on the rise.  
Globally, the World Health Organisation predicts that TBI will become one of the leading causes of disability and death by the year 2020.
As a result the demand for information, services and supports has increased significantly in recent years.  
We are raising funds to keep up with the demand for support, services, awareness and prevention.

</p>
<p>Monika
has spent the last decade studying, practicing, implementing and teaching the
tools of Yoga and Ayurveda in conjunction with Mood Disorders. This was the
result of over two decades spent suffering with mood disorders and a
corresponding breakdown of physical health which included living in physical
pain 24/7. In 2005, after spending four debilitating years on Ontario
Disability, Monika’s suicidal tendencies had developed to the point of being
unbearable. The time had come to learn how to build a life worth living or give
in to these tendencies. Giving in was not an option as she was the sole
supporting/caregiving parent to two young children. She set out to find alternative methods to supplement
the tradition, North American medical system which was not providing the relief
needed to create an accessible, sustainable, self-supporting life. What she
found in Yoga and Ayurveda were the tools she needed to empower herself, and
others, on a holistic journey of recovery. </p>
<p>Over the
past decade, while diligently working her own recovery process, Monika has built two small business in the fields of accounting and
Yoga while creating a holistic healing/recovery blueprint. Her family physician
and therapist both often comment on the tremendous transformation she has
created in her life. Part of this recovery has included running a weekly Yoga
class focused on helping students improve their own mental health. </p>
<p>This Yoga
for Mental Health class is now in its sixth year. It is run by donations.
Donations are appreciated but never required as financial challenges should not
be a barrier to wellness in Monika’s opinion. Donations received from this class go back into providing treats and special events for this community. Students from this class have
also used this information to create amazing transformations in their own
lives.<span>  Some have gone on to become Yoga
teachers, others have created the health improvements necessary to return to
work, many now enjoy improved relationships with family, friends and
themselves! The success stories of these students include being able to
complete educational goals; passing the bar exam; being able to provide
familial support in times of need; volunteering in the community. In short
these students have been able to build lives worth living in which their mental
health challenges and symptoms have become manageable. All of this from
attending weekly classes, imagine what could happen if more people could access
this technology on a deeper level. </span></p>
<p>Monika
has imagined exactly that with her newest venture On Solid Ground (OSG). The
Mindful Living Programs at OSG are a way for students to access ten years of
holistic recovery information presented in a supported way so that they too may
create a personalized recovery blueprint. These programs not only help in
recovery but can be used by anyone, at any time in their lives, to transform
life’s struggles into a more fulfilling life experience. </p>
<p>Stress,
burn out and mood disorders rob the experiencer of the ability to take care of
self and be a contributing member of our society. Your donations will be used
to help those with financial challenges access these programs not only for the
betterment of their own lives but society as a whole. Thank you in advance for helping
to build this mindful living community which holds space for people to find their own solid ground!</p>

<div>At the most basic level, I need to pay the rent on my current (very excellent) open studio <b>turningearthceramics.co.uk</b> here in sunny Hackney, London.

<div><span>Aditionally, I need raw materials. Working efficiently at a minimum workload, my materials costs are at least £700. Increased demand will force this cost up, of course, but once we reach that stage the materials will pay for themselves.

<p>The LS allows the water contained in it and its container to reach 281,3°F thanks to its graduated valve. At that temperature the water becomes free from micro-organisms that usually are responsible of gastrointestinal infections that frequently cause death among children, especially the unweaned one.</p>
<p>The double screwed cylinder keeps the nipple inside to be sterilized as well, which is a revolutionnary detail that prevents the child to ANY contact with contaminated parts.</p>
<p><strong>2) </strong><strong>Is the baby bottle dangerous? </strong></p>
<p>No! Thank to the safety valve the baby bottle is safe. If the valve ever breaks, the temperature reached will be maximum 212°F, at that  point the behavior of the baby bottle would be as dangerous as a simple boiling pot on the kitchen fire.</p>
<p><strong>3) </strong><strong>How do we understand that the water is ready?</strong></p>
<p>The valve will allows air to escape once the right temperature is reached. So basically we know that the water is ready when we hear or see the vapor escaping from the valve…Exactly like a Moka Bialetti!</p>
<p><strong>4) </strong><strong>Do the baby bottle changes colour?</strong></p>
<p>No, because we decided to maintain it without any paint that could be dangerous for the environment. In the video it changes colour just to give a better perception of the heating process.</p>
<p><strong>5) </strong><strong>Are the components of the baby bottle dangerous for the environment?</strong></p>
<p>No! The baby bottle is recyclable.</p>
<p><strong>6) </strong><strong>On which kind of heat source the baby bottle can be put?</strong></p>
<p>On any heat source : a flame, a burner.</p>
<p><strong>7) </strong><strong>How much water can we put in it?</strong></p>
<p>We can fill it with 300 mL, the average amount of a baby meal.</p>
<p><strong>8) </strong><strong>What happen to the micro-organisms after the sterilization process?</strong></p>
<p>Because of the high temperature, the components of micro-organisms “denaturate”; it means that their structure is distroyed and they will be inactivated and no more harmful.</p>
<p><strong>9) </strong><strong>Why a clean source of water is so important? </strong></p>
<p>Because our body is composed for more than 60% of water, which is essential for survival. In underdeveloped countries water is often contaminated with micro-organisms that cause diseases like gastroenteritis which lead to death because of dehydration.</p>
<p><strong><strong>10) W</strong><strong>hat is the difference between this baby bottle and the others?</strong></strong></p>
<p>- It reaches sterilization of BOTTLE, WATER and NIPPLE, which are perfectly ready to use with no more danger of infections</p>
<p>- The temperature reached by the Ls is the one used in most laboratories to reach sterilization</p>

""In the third world every day 4,000 children die as a result of lack of drinking water"" Helvetas

“Water is one of the earth’s most precious and threatened
resources. Health is one of each person’s most precious resources. […]” World Health Organization



Poor hygiene and lack of adequate instruments for sterilization are among the leading causes of death in the third world and war zones. The existing instruments for sterilization are often useless due to unavailability of sources of energy or chemicals. Our innovative patent turns a baby bottle into a sterilizer for water that does not require electricity, gas nor chemicals.Let's start from the beginningOnce upon a time … A coffee bar, a table, two drinks and a napkin. The little napkin they give you when they serve you a few snacks. Usually during conversations, that napkin transforms in something disgusting: usually a little oily ball, sometimes a mountains of splinters, occasionnally you scribble all over it. That evening there was no space left for oily balls, splinters or random lines…That evening, in Lausanne, we started to draw on it…...we drown the skeleton of a dream : a world where also little children born in less lucky areas of the world could have the opportunity to live their lives, play, grow up, without being afraid of getting sick because of dirty water and the micro-organisms in it. What a young intern and a entrepreneur could do to outline a smile on these children’s face? That evening we started to sketch our Ls prototype, and our project made the first little step.We didn’t have much money, so we contacted some friends, some of whom where engineers, film-makers, photographers, and …mothers. Together we joined our experiences and our knowledge and we made it. A functioning autosterilizing baby bottle with its safe nipple, tested for the first time in our small garden in Bissone and, after a series of laboratory tests, officially patented.Two years later we’re here, on a crowd funding platform, and we need you to help us making a bigger step toward a better world. A world where water will return being a source of life instead of a source of disease.What is our present stage of development

We have patented a system
consisting of a simple double threaded cylinder and a valve (specifically
calibrated) mounted on an hermetic tank that when exposed to hight temperature,
sterilizes both the water contained in it and the teat without chemicals or
filters.
We deposited a European
patent and the international patent is pending.
The design of the
prototype we used to test effectiveness of our patented system, is unpolished.
We wanted to focus on functioning more than look and this not-so-good-looking
prototype made the job.
Indeed, we used it to run
several lab tests and got exceptional results!After months of researches
we are ready to put the final product into production. It will not differ from
the first prototype in anything but the shape, re-designed to be child-friendly
and manageable.Engineers and mold makers
worked together to develop an effective and yet ergonomic product for our
brilliant system which is now ready to be industrialized.
Today, our baby bottle is
ready, we have collected data and refined our project. 
Today we need you! We need
you to give us the kick-off to enable us to launch the production and make our
dream real. What we ask of youOur goal is to create a handy and economical solution, which we trust could save millions of lives. With your help we want to obtain all the necessary certifications to start right away the production and be ready to deliver starting from October 2016.In April 2016 we will produce a small amount of early production of our baby bottles (200 pieces) and test the project in a selected location during a period of 1 month length over a cluster of 200 children. With the support of a medical equip we will be demonstrate the reduction of specific viruses and bacteria and the consequent improvement of health among children. In this period, we will shoot a documentary film of our expedition and create a photographic book to make the world aware of our project and to rise awareness and sympathy towards one of the main problems that affects poorer countries.What we ask of you is to believe in The Ls by participating in our dream today ad tomorrow we will be able to say: ""We have saved a life!""The Ls baby bottle: Lab ExperimentBiologist prof.Luca

after putting the baby-bottle on the Bunsen burner, waiting until the valve
whistled and then keeping the temperature of 281.3 ° F and pressure of 3.5 Bar
2 more minutes, see instructions below)
We have performed three
types of tests on both the untreated and treated water : 
• 
 1ml of water was
distributed over the already hardened culture medium  
• 
1 ml of water was mixed
with liquid culture medium before hardening  
• 
100ml of water passed through
the microfilter by means of the vacuum pump 
 Moreover we verified
both types of culture media with the purpose of verifying the effectiveness of
the treatment. Water and teat put
through the baby bottle's treatment experienced complete
sterilization. 
There were no bacteria
growing in culture media where the water was poured and the teat was rubbed
after the treatment by the Ls.from left to right

actively in the creation of this valuable project to help these two young
researchers , Mauro and Shairin , to realize their dream , it was for me an
enriching opportunity . Great it was the excitement when we saw together ,
the results of our experiments .These have demonstrated the effectiveness of
the baby bottle : water and teat contaminated by bacteria , even dangerous ,
treated through the system, have been effectively sterilized. In fact , on
Petri dishes nothing has grew from the water coming from the baby bottle and
from the teat after sterilization. The experiment is then settled. I'm
sure this product will save many young and helpless lives. For sure ,

become such an epidemic that First Lady Michelle Obama made this statement, in
her speech at the launch of her Let’s Move program…”economic experts tell us
that we’re spending outrageous amounts of money treating obesity related
conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. And public health experts
tell us that the current generation could actually be on track to have a
shorter lifespan than their parents.”We need to teach our youth at a young age about the positives of a healthy lifestyle to give them a fair chance at being healthy. Being fit...Isn't just for the moment...It's a lifestyle! Shawn

<p>In 1969, she immigrated to Germany and lived there for six years. During
 these years, Nana went on with her transition as there was more support 
and possibilities to help her accomplish this goal.</p>
<p>In 1975 Nana returns to Thessaloniki, Greece. Eventually, she became 
active amongst trans women and LGBT rights groups. Today, she is an 
active member of S.Y.D. (Greek Transgendered Association) and Homophonia 
(Thessaloniki’s Pride Festival). Up until this 
day, she still fights for LGBTQI rights. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2015 Nana was sadly diagnosed with two different types of lung cancer.</p>
<p>As a trans woman in current Greek society, she is struggling under the broken Department of Health.

<p>Earlier this year, the feature documentary NANA by Lara Kristen was released, documenting her life story. The film is a way for us to learn herstory through storytelling, observation and archive material that shows trans issues and difficulties in Greek daily reality.<br/></p>

<p>Can you think of something where mechanical properties (stiffness, softness) are irrelevant?</p>
<p>Then, why not try understanding the mechanical properties of cells/tissues of a human body. They might be indicative of something important. Let's not ignore the mechanical properties of the cells. They might reveal things better!</p>
<p>But, are there tools that can actually do mechanical testing of biological cells??  </p>
<p>At BendFlex, we have spent more than a decade developing tools that will help us understand mechanical properties of biological cells and tissues (<a href=""https://goo.gl/nLHlLk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Check out a video here!</a>). The tools include micro-scale grippers, micro-scale stretchers, ultra-sensitive force sensors among others.  These tools are results of a novel design paradigm called compliant mechanisms. We come from Prof. G. K. Ananthasuresh's M2D2 lab at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, who is one of the pioneers of this field. Also, we have clinicians advising us on helping make this world a better place!</p>
<p>We believe, understanding mechanical properties of cells will be beneficial in revealing more information than what existing diagnostics can. </p>
<p>We are convinced. If you too are, then kindly support our initiative</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary Pause! Look around!
Can you think of something where mechanical properties (stiffness, softness) are irrelevant?
Then, why not try understanding the mechanical properties of cells/tissues of a human body. They might be indicative of something important. Let's not ignore the mechanical properties of the cells. They might reveal things better!
But, are there tools that can actually do mechanical testing of biological cells??  
At BendFlex, we have spent more than a decade developing tools that will help us understand mechanical properties of biological cells and tissues (Check out a video here!). The tools include micro-scale grippers, micro-scale stretchers, ultra-sensitive force sensors among others.  These tools are results of a novel design paradigm called compliant mechanisms. We come from Prof. G. K. Ananthasuresh's M2D2 lab at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, who is one of the pioneers of this field. Also, we have clinicians advising us on helping make this world a better place!
We believe, understanding mechanical properties of cells will be beneficial in revealing more information than what existing diagnostics can. 
We are convinced. If you too are, then kindly support our initiative
What we needWe are raising $750,000. This project is capital intensive, and a significant amount of the funding would go into procuring instruments and setting up our lab. Also, this project needs one to conduct a number of trials before it’s efficacy is established, and the techniques becomes robust. A overview of the split of the utilization of the money is captured in the image below:  As a first step, using these funds we shall develop tools that would enhance in-vitro fertilization.

Impact

Imagine a day when we could detect cancer at its very early stage. 
Chemical-free diagnostics!
We believe that the potential of our technology would bring a new era of in-vivo diagnostic testing  down to a single cell level which compares to the in-situ non-destructive testing methods of the industry. With mechanical/biophysical biomarkers emerging, alternatives to IVD that depend on difficult to manage and operate molecular versions (cold chain, shelf life, sensitive readers etc) could reach healthcare to the masses and much lower costs.
This is a very ambitious but realistic project. On the successful outcome of this project we can be more effective in diagnosing the disease-state. Distinguish healthy cells from unhealthy ones. Consider this case: during the initial phase of cancer the number of affected cells are 5 in a 1000. Because they are very few in number it is likely that we miss on detecting them when you put through bio-chemical testing. But, if you are doing diagnostics at a single-cell level then it is very unlikely that we miss out these affected cells.
The importance of understanding the mechanical properties of cells, and tools that we have developed addressing those have been published by us in leading international journals. The publications are peer-reviewed and have won awards at different levels. We have also developed compliant mechanisms for leading med-tech companies which enabled them to understand things with a new perspective. They see a lot of future in these tools.

Do you want to feel healthier, stronger and well rested but don’t know how? <br/><span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span><div>  Are you interested in finding the perfect vitamin for mornings and evenings?

If you answered, “Yes” to any of these questions, you may want to keep reading… <div>  </div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Welcome to the new and improved way to have a healthier more complete life with “EnNeuro”.  We developed a process to create a vitamin designed just for you in the morning to get you moving and same for the nighttime. Multivitamins you buy at the store come packed with things your body doesn’t need and misses out on essential nutrients, well not anymore. With our process we have spent 12 years researching exactly what your mind and body needs in the morning and evening, for clarity during the day and peaceful rest at night. “EnNeuro” allows a person to take advantage of a life with optimal health and performance when they are taking the right supplements. </span></div>
<div>Hello! My name is David and I suffer from fatigue, lack of focus, motivation, chronic brain-fog, stress, depression.  But I need to feel great everyday in order to be present at work, with my family and friends. Why is this so difficult?  I do not want to rely on endless cups of coffee and energy drink just to get through the day… So what is a guy left to do?? </div>
<div>  Invent a safer, more effective alternative to feeling your best each day.  Something that can help working professionals, students, entrepreneurs, employees and employers from all walks of life!  Something that can invigorate people all over the world… And then…. EnNeuro was born! </div>
<div>Every single year of my life prior to my tenure at junior high, I had always been successful in school, with tons of energy to enjoy the company of my friends after school. I remember distinctively, however, the day in mid junior year, my tests started getting harder, and even more as I progressed into my first year of college; classes and assignments became more complex and deadlines increased the stress. </div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">To make matters worse, I had to get a full time job while pulling over 18 semester credit hours at the same time.

When I started searching for solutions and polling my peers I was shocked to find out that many of their routines included: 1) Coffee 3-5/day 2) Energy Drinks 2-7/day 3) Adderall 1-2/day and energy pills 3-6/day. </span></div>

</div>
<div> Coffee, prescription pills and energy drinks were prevalent with people at my job and school, most of these individuals barely even got 4 or 5 hours of sleep which made it even worst and even scary for me, to see that I would have to do the same just to get by and graduate. I started taking lots of different vitamins and trying to relieve stress and achieving REM sleep as quick as possible so I wouldn't have to sleep 8 hours/day but maybe 4 or 5. </div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450287314/lxakdjqmowxofibcrnx4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div>
<div>Another issue was, all the meals most people ate during my college years were fast food and microwavable meals, which even disturbed me more, because I knew that there must have been healthier options to do this to be successful in school. Vitamins started to become my daily nutrition, as well as to counter any negative effects that could deter my efforts to stay focused at work and school. </div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Throughout my junior year of college to after graduation, I started playing with single natural ingredients that can help provide rich nutrients to your brain, thus increasing your productivity level without brain fog. I started noticing slight increases of myself being more alert and attentive to tasks at hand.

As I climbed the corporate ladder, I noticed that I started working more than normal hours approximately 50 to 70 hours a week, doing many mundane and tedious tasks and meetings. </span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I continually sought out more and more natural ingredients and tested them on myself by using multiple blends of the ingredients simultaneously, I had to use the process of elimination over the years to find the perfect blend formulation that worked synergistically without any side effects.

I had many friends and peers try my dietary blend with me during this time of discovery, with trials and errors. After painstakingly searching and developing a healthier choice to be a better you, I finally found the perfect blend of nutrients. </span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">This happened because I was determined to seek a better and healthier alternative to change my life, and since then, it has become my primary source of nutrients to get by in life and be able to think faster, retain memories and stay coherently focused in all situations, at school or work. This has really helped me get promoted many times by being more efficient and productive.


Now I want to share this with the world to help others get through the experience I had, or to achieve more than I did, in a healthy way, not sacrificing their health but to redefine normal. I learned you can do it all, simply by nourishing your brain to improve your cognitive function.

<p>  Do you take supplements every morning? The numbers are growing. A new government study found
that more than half of American adults take at least one dietary supplement.
But despite their popularity, many experts remain skeptical of their effects.
""The pill is a nice idea, but we have no reason to think this
one-size-fits-all dose makes any sense for each individual,"" said Deen Dr.

</div></div>","Do you know that your energy level is too low, despite endless cups of coffee and energy drinks?  Do you hate the inevitable crash they cause?

Do you want to feel healthier, stronger and well rested but don’t know how?    Are you interested in finding the perfect vitamin for mornings and evenings?

If you answered, “Yes” to any of these questions, you may want to keep reading…   
Welcome to the new and improved way to have a healthier more complete life with “EnNeuro”.  We developed a process to create a vitamin designed just for you in the morning to get you moving and same for the nighttime. Multivitamins you buy at the store come packed with things your body doesn’t need and misses out on essential nutrients, well not anymore. With our process we have spent 12 years researching exactly what your mind and body needs in the morning and evening, for clarity during the day and peaceful rest at night. “EnNeuro” allows a person to take advantage of a life with optimal health and performance when they are taking the right supplements. 
Hello! My name is David and I suffer from fatigue, lack of focus, motivation, chronic brain-fog, stress, depression.  But I need to feel great everyday in order to be present at work, with my family and friends. Why is this so difficult?  I do not want to rely on endless cups of coffee and energy drink just to get through the day… So what is a guy left to do?? 
  Invent a safer, more effective alternative to feeling your best each day.  Something that can help working professionals, students, entrepreneurs, employees and employers from all walks of life!  Something that can invigorate people all over the world… And then…. EnNeuro was born! 
Every single year of my life prior to my tenure at junior high, I had always been successful in school, with tons of energy to enjoy the company of my friends after school. I remember distinctively, however, the day in mid junior year, my tests started getting harder, and even more as I progressed into my first year of college; classes and assignments became more complex and deadlines increased the stress. 
To make matters worse, I had to get a full time job while pulling over 18 semester credit hours at the same time.

When I started searching for solutions and polling my peers I was shocked to find out that many of their routines included: 1) Coffee 3-5/day 2) Energy Drinks 2-7/day 3) Adderall 1-2/day and energy pills 3-6/day. 

                                                                      

                                                          The Impact: 

 Coffee, prescription pills and energy drinks were prevalent with people at my job and school, most of these individuals barely even got 4 or 5 hours of sleep which made it even worst and even scary for me, to see that I would have to do the same just to get by and graduate. I started taking lots of different vitamins and trying to relieve stress and achieving REM sleep as quick as possible so I wouldn't have to sleep 8 hours/day but maybe 4 or 5. 




Another issue was, all the meals most people ate during my college years were fast food and microwavable meals, which even disturbed me more, because I knew that there must have been healthier options to do this to be successful in school. Vitamins started to become my daily nutrition, as well as to counter any negative effects that could deter my efforts to stay focused at work and school. 
Throughout my junior year of college to after graduation, I started playing with single natural ingredients that can help provide rich nutrients to your brain, thus increasing your productivity level without brain fog. I started noticing slight increases of myself being more alert and attentive to tasks at hand.

As I climbed the corporate ladder, I noticed that I started working more than normal hours approximately 50 to 70 hours a week, doing many mundane and tedious tasks and meetings. 
I continually sought out more and more natural ingredients and tested them on myself by using multiple blends of the ingredients simultaneously, I had to use the process of elimination over the years to find the perfect blend formulation that worked synergistically without any side effects.

I had many friends and peers try my dietary blend with me during this time of discovery, with trials and errors. After painstakingly searching and developing a healthier choice to be a better you, I finally found the perfect blend of nutrients. 
This happened because I was determined to seek a better and healthier alternative to change my life, and since then, it has become my primary source of nutrients to get by in life and be able to think faster, retain memories and stay coherently focused in all situations, at school or work. This has really helped me get promoted many times by being more efficient and productive.


Now I want to share this with the world to help others get through the experience I had, or to achieve more than I did, in a healthy way, not sacrificing their health but to redefine normal. I learned you can do it all, simply by nourishing your brain to improve your cognitive function.
 
It took me over 12 years to perfect and develop this cognitive enhancer for you to experience an increase of a healthier and balanced lifestyle without any sacrifice to what you currently do. 

                                                           
                                                           Our Mission 
“We provide all-natural supplement products to create a balanced and healthy lifestyle. We also offer unparalleled opportunities for motivated individuals to take control of their future and build the life they have dreamed of.”




  Do you take supplements every morning? The numbers are growing. A new government study found
that more than half of American adults take at least one dietary supplement.
But despite their popularity, many experts remain skeptical of their effects.
""The pill is a nice idea, but we have no reason to think this
one-size-fits-all dose makes any sense for each individual,"" said Deen Dr.
Darwin Deen, clinical professor in the department of family and social medicine
at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. That is why our supplement
is perfect, we have specifics components to help give your body what it needs:
day and night.
My product
is called EnNeuro for day and night, which is a proprietary formula that works
by harnessing dozens of natural and extracted nootriments to synergistically
enhance your cognitive function. EnNeuro is a eurogenic that supports memory
improvement and mood uplifting by acting as a psycho-stimulant without causing
a jitters or a crash later end of the day.

<p>My name is Stefanie, and I currently live in Temecula, CA
with my boyfriend of 6 1/2 years, Brandon, and our 16 month old son, Tristan. The
reason I am writing this letter is to tell you about the way our lives have
been affected by Kidney Disease.</p>
<p>When Brandon was 21 years old, he went on dialysis and
received a kidney transplant from his father. The transplant lasted
approximately five years. One night in early 2011, he told me that he was sick
and that I needed to take him to the ER. He was admitted to Rancho Springs
Medical Center in Murrieta. We found out that he had pneumonia and was not
producing his own blood; his hemoglobin level was 6 (the normal range for an
adult male is between 14-18).</p>
<p>After receiving multiple blood transfusions and finally stabilizing,
the doctors said that he was lucky to be alive. After seven days at Rancho
Springs, he was transported to Loma Linda University Medical Center in Loma
Linda, CA. He was admitted and hospitalized for another 30 days. We later came
to find out that his kidney transplant was being rejected and poisoning his
body. His transplant was removed, and the doctors installed a venous catheter
in his neck to do dialysis until he was able to have a fistula surgically
stationed in his arm.</p>
<p>In 2013, I found out I was pregnant, which was unexpected
and not planned. Processing the sheer magnitude of Brandon’s condition and
thinking about raising a child through it all was beyond overwhelming. But on
April 26, 2014, I gave birth to a healthy baby boy, Tristan Michael Miller, who
honestly has changed our lives in the best way possible.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442854591/uayq1udmmsnb7x7ztxcb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Currently, Brandon in school full time, doing dialysis 3
days a week for 4 hours each day, and taking care of our now 16 month old son. One
of the things I love the most about Brandon is that he has never once
complained about his situation or dialysis. He focuses on making the most of his
life and loving his family sacrificially. Recently, however, he has expressed that he doesn't know how much longer he can handle dialysis for. You can imagine how shocked I was to hear this from him, since he
has always been so positive.</p>
<p>We are doing everything we can to get him a transplant. He
is currently on the transplant list at Loma Linda University Medical Center and
Scripps Hospital in San Diego. The Scripps kidney transplant waitlist is
approximately 4-6 years, and he has been on it for almost 5 years now. Scripps
is concerned about finding him a match. Since he has 99% of the population’s
antibodies from all the blood transfusions he received, his doctors are afraid
that a transplant will be rejected.</p>
<p>Recently, Brandon’s social worker at Davita Dialysis told
him about The Kidney Project at the University of California San Francisco. They
are working on creating a bioartificial kidney, and it might be the solution to
Brandon’s situation and millions of others like his. I have begun reading any
information I could find regarding the implantable artificial kidney, scouring
the internet like a crazy person in hopes to finding ways to make this project
happen as quickly as possible. The research that has been done is breathtaking, and it has really given
me hope because Brandon would be a perfect candidate. He is 31 years old and in
great health besides his kidney issue.</p>
<p>I wanted to share my story because Kidney Disease affects so
many patients and their families in this country. Approximately 26 Million
Americans suffer from Kidney Disease. Maybe you know
someone waiting for a kidney transplant, or who has had a kidney transplant. Maybe
you have a loved one that is suffering from this disease, and you don’t know
how to help. Maybe you are the one suffering, and you are losing hope.</p>
<p>Did you know that kidney disease touches more lives than
cancer and HIV combined?</p>
<p>Did you know that African Americans are three times more
likely to experience kidney failure? </p>
<p>Did you know that even though Native Americans make up just
1.5 percent of the U.S. population, they have the highest rate of diabetes in
the world and one of the highest rates of end stage renal disease?</p>
<p>This is my goal: I would really love for human trials with
The Kidney Project to start ASAP, not only for my boyfriend but for anyone that
is currently suffering from or has been affected by this disease. An
implantable artificial kidney sounds hard to believe, right? Not really. This
can be a reality sooner than we think if we can join together and not only
support The Kidney Project but help raise the funds they need to take the
project to the next level.</p>
<p>This is the solution: The Kidney Project needs to raise the
necessary funds to begin trials in 2017, if not before. If you are interested
in partnering with us to impact the lives of Kidney Disease patients
everywhere, please do not leave this page without making a donation, making a
public post on social media or all of the above.  If you or your company is interested in
matching donations or donating perks to fund donors, please contact us.  Anything helps.</p>

<p>Our dream is to build a sports performance gym that focuses on mental strength and mental health as much as it does on physical performance. Athletes will come to us whether they are completely healthy and looking for just physical training or have a mental illness and need mental health treatment. We anticipate that most athletes will come to us for both. Every athlete can benefit from improving their focus and stress management.

Our dream is to build a sports performance gym that focuses on mental strength and mental health as much as it does on physical performance. Athletes will come to us whether they are completely healthy and looking for just physical training or have a mental illness and need mental health treatment. We anticipate that most athletes will come to us for both. Every athlete can benefit from improving their focus and stress management. Olympic athletes and World Cup champions use many of the techniques we will be using such as neurofeedback and meditation.

It’s time to meet them.</strong></p><p>This journey was born from a conversation between a personal trainer turned Marine Corps Infantry Officer, and a nerd turned Marine Corps Intelligence Officer. Fed up with the difficulties in finding workout partners, and intimately familiar with the benefits of having one, Captain Floyd and Captain Hennessey did what Marines always do: they solved the problem.</p><p>Introducing TeamMate, a free, user-friendly app that helps you discover the fitness community around you. TeamMate connects athletes at all skill levels without relying on chance encounters within the confines of a traditional gym. After all, there are athletes and wannabe athletes all around us! It’s time to meet them, and together, we can create a huge and dynamic community of fitness enthusiasts. TeamMate will help us find each other, making it easy for athletes at all levels to try new routines, new gyms and new personal trainers alongside new workout partners and new friends.  </p><p>This is a game changer, and the missing link in fitness technology. As our dynamic, health-positive network grows, TeamMate will make it exponentially more awesome by adding new features, interacting with the traditional health and fitness industry in new and exciting ways, and integrating with other fitness technology applications and devices.  </p><p>Not having a workout partner is a bummer, and it’s one of the primary reasons that people don’t workout.

With a focus towards analysis and planning, I work to ensure that our relentless drive is tempered by a well thought out data driven plan, and that we are ready to capitalize on all opportunities as they come.When it comes to my personal fitness routine, I prefer CrossFit. My ultimate goal is to have a lot of different workout activities that I can continue throughout life to stay active and healthy. In the gym, I am a bit of a workout chameleon, adapting to the workout style and drive of my partner and the surrounding environment. I am competition-driven and always prefer to workout with a partner; it keeps me on point. I want a TeamMate to surf or snowboard with, although I am a little rusty, so don’t expect too much from me if the waves are too big. I am also always looking for a good game of soccer. It’s also great to have a group to share in the misery of the WOD.I find it difficult to find workout partners and even when I do, someone who is a great running partner may not be the best spotter. So I need TeamMates of all kinds, to work with me in different areas of fitness. Donate today and help us to bring TeamMate to the world so that we can all discover the fitness community around us!""-        Ryan“I’m the grunt, and as the CEO of TeamMate, I bring an infantryman’s leadership philosophy to the team. This is a no-BS way of doing business that is oriented around the principle of servant leadership, combined with a relentless drive to execute and an obsession with mission completion.The same warrior-like mentality that drives me in the workplace, and in the Corps, also drives me in the gym. I like to train hard... and I need a few TeamMates. I need a swimming-partner for lap swimming, especially for long distance underwater crossovers, which can be dangerous to do alone. I need TeamMate for when I travel, so that I can quickly find hiking partners and fellow mountainbikers that know the local trails. I need TeamMate for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu sparring partners that live in my area, so that I can finally break out my mats that are just sitting upstairs collecting dust. I need boxers in my weight category, a surfing partner / coach (I suck at surfing), and a spotter at the gym for when I want to max out.I’m creating a solution to a problem that is very real to me. I know there are others out there like me, who are looking for an easy way to find training partners and are stunned to discover that, despite all of our wonderful advances in technology… THERE IS NO EASY WAY TO FIND A WORKOUT PARTNER! That is insane to me! Donate to this campaign so that we can FIX THIS PROBLEM FOR GOOD. Users in Northern California, Southern California, Central Texas and South Texas: you will see me on TeamMate. We will match. And we will crush it together.… but we can’t build this community without you. Thank you for backing our Indiegogo campaign, but I’m not done with you yet... I want more. Stick with us. Download TeamMate and use it. Be a part of our movement!”-     Kristopher   The ImpactTeamMate will bring us together.We envision a future in which workout partners are a swipe or two away. TeamMate’s dynamic community of fitness enthusiasts will have the ability to easily connect to share fitness activities, making it easy for athletes at all levels to try new routines, new gyms, and new personal trainers alongside new workout partners and new friends.This community needs a jumpstart!

I was going through life afraid, and I wasn't enjoying myself. The friends I had were always having so much fun, the freedom that they had was the freedom that I wanted, but I was too afraid to experience. <br/><br/>But then one day I decided to change, I decided, I made the choice to stop being so afraid. I never was the kid doing the crazy stuff on the playground, but I was always envious of him or her. As I grew up I started to dissolve and demolish the fears that I had, and one day I saw Parkour...<br/><br/>I realized that Parkour was the physical manifestation of what I had been doing as a young teenager, it wasn't what I was physically doing, but I made the choice to step into this new found realm of freedom, and god/life/the universe opened up the pathway to lead me there.  I saw someone who was so free, they had what looked to me to be complete mastery of mind &amp; body. It excited and inspired me so deeply, that I jumped up off the couch. turned off the tv, and ran to my computer.<br/><br/>I had been watching G4's Ninja Warrior. A much more heroic and noble version of what you see on American Ninja Warrior today. I will never forget the name being shouted by the Japanese announcer ""Levi Meeuwenberer!!!"" as it echoed through the speakers of my television. <br/><br/>Levi Meeuwenberg a Professional Freerunner and Michigan native from Traverse City, flashed across the screen, he was jumping, vaulting and flipping outside and onstage next to Madonna, yes that Madonna. Levi wasn't there for the money or the fame, there was no reward for beating that course, besides self improvement &amp; the respect of being a high level athlete. <br/><br/>He was there to test himself on that course, a course that was infinitely more difficult than what you see on TV today. Levi's showreel was nothing short of amazing he was definitely a head of his time, what he was doing 10 years ago is still considered advanced today. <br/><br/>Anyways, I jumped on the internet, started searching Freerunning and researched everything I could about it! <br/><br/>At the time there were mostly just picture tutorials, yes at the time picture tutorials. They were the brunt of what existed and I started practicing everywhere I could. <br/><br/>Less than a week later, I told some good friends of mine about Parkour. <br/><br/>I told them of this new found love that I had, and what Parkour/Freerunning was. Naturally they asked me to some them what I had been practicing. I was excited, confident, and cocky, I brushed back my hair, rubbed my palms together, and attempted a lazy vault over a wooden fence, (you know one of those fences where the poles stick into a slot in the adjacent piece of wood....)<br/><br/>Well that day I learned a lesson I would never forget. Always check your obstacle. I went for the lazy vault, the fence post caved and I fell straight onto my @$$. My friends burst out laughing. I was now a red tomato, enflamed in pain &amp; embarrassment. To this day I am not sure what hurt more, my body or my ego.<br/><br/>I picked myself up off the ground, fixed the fence, and tried again on the next spot, instantly their metaphorical ears perked up. ""What is this called? That was so dope!"" Parkour I answered, my self confidence restored. We all started training that day, Jack became my partner in crime. We went out from sun up til' sun down, training everywhere we could, we were 15 so we had to walk to every spot we could, doing whatever movements we could along the way. <br/><br/>After 8 months or so of training my wrestling season began, winter came back into existence, and Jack joined diving. We were the class clowns back then, or at least we thought we were. We told everyone about Parkour, few joined, the ""early innovators"" as market research would call it, Jack fell in love with the photography side of Parkour and kept running with it, no pun intended. I was deep in the game, I was in LOVE. I was told to recruit a fellow classmate named Jesse Harrison to start training, everyone Jack &amp; I trained had the large advantage of learning through us as coaches and didn't have to trouble shoot the things we did in the first year or so of our training. Jesse was a martial artist, and picked it up naturally. He was a great friend, team member, and training buddy for a long time. To learn flips we did private lessons at Livonia Gymnastics Academy for over a year, once a week. <br/><br/>I finally quit wrestling because of my love of Parkour, and the large damper that it put on my training. I was great at wrestling, but I loved Parkour. It gave me the freedom I had been searching for my entire life. We started training harder and really pushing ourselves. One warm summer day I am driving, and I see an ad for Freedom Freerunning Academy on Facebook. I was ecstatic! A Parkour Gym in Michigan? No Way! Where is this place... I bet its somewhere far away. Soon after I realized that not only was this gym in my hometown, it was less than 2 miles away... I immediately cancelled all other plans and went there. I walked inside, met the owners, Dylan Borland &amp; TJ Mckenzie, they had opened MI's 1st Parkour Gym. I trained for hours, ran up the warped wall my first try, and completed every handstand challenge I could think of. I was just 18 at this point. <br/><br/>I was good at Parkour, this place helped lead me to greatness. Jesse &amp; I made the ""pro team"" for the gym, it didn't meant that we were at professional level, we were good, but now we had a goal to train for, live up to the title we were given. After all, we were performing for the Pistons, booking other performances, and working as a team. Caleb, Eric, Jeremiah, Jesse, TJ. We were the Freedom 5. We were a great team. One day Dylan &amp; TJ called a team meeting we were so excited, we weren't sure if we had booked another performance, or what the meeting could be for, but we couldn't have been more devastated, the gym, after only being open for a year, was closing. We had lost the lease agreement with the current landlord, and were being bought out by Foundations systems of Michigan. It was a blessing in disguise, 2 years later, our team had grown to 7 members, and we reopened as Phoenix Freerunning Academy in Livonia, MI. There are details that don't need to be discussed, but I loved Phoenix, I at the time had gone through my own rebirth, see 4 years ago on May 25th, I almost died in a horrific car accident. An accident that changed my life, temporarily shattered my psyche, and left me utterly confused, alienated, and feeling alone. <br/><br/>A year goes by, its May 25th again... That night I was in the woods with my friend Mike Harp, celebrating life, we were just looking at deer, listening to the river and hanging out in the Matthaei Botanical Gardens, in Ann Arbor, it was 2am, when suddenly my phone rang, it was one of my teammates Jacob Winslow, ""TJ is at U of M hospital, he was hit by a train"". I was shocked. Why was this happening? How did I escape what could of been my death a year before, walk away unscathed, it was nothing short of a miracle. But why now? Why exactly a year later did TJ get hit by a train. What was he doing? How did his car get hit by a train! What an idiot! Was he trying to beat it? I was angry at him. I was angry at life, holding back tears, like I am right now as I write this to you. What were the chances of this? How did I end up less than 15 minutes away from him? Why wasn't I there? I had asked everyone to go to the beach that day, nobody went with me. TJ was with a girl in Ann Arbor, he was going bridge jumping at a popular spot. I don't know if he knew that the bridge was a railroad track for a still active amway. We showed up at the hospital, so many people were there for TJ. He was alive. What happened to him? TJ was hit, by a train, with his body... not in a car, the train more than grazed him, it sent him flying into the air and down into the river below. He was going back for a bag that he thought was full of important belongings. Camera &amp; equipment, keys, wallet, phone, etc. <br/><br/>TJ was and is an amazing athlete, but he always told us he hated rail precisions (jumping from rail to rail). Little did we know, he had a depth perception problem, how he is as amazing as of a Freerunner with a depth perception problem goes to show how good he really is. <br/><br/>Anyways, last May I was working 3 jobs, I was teaching at a tumbling company, a gymnastics gym, and working as a busser/waiter, I met a man who gave me the opportunity of a lifetime, but wasn't able to provide the funding to fully build the gym. That is where you come in.  Our team at Movement United is doing our best to add value to people's lives, build this gym for the community, and successfully pursue the dream I have had since I was 17. To be a professional level Parkour/Freerunning Athlete and to own my own gym! <br/><br/> </p></div>","Why Movement United? Movement United was created in 2016 to unite the Parkour, Circus, Acroyoga, Breakdance, and Martial Arts Tricking communities in Michigan.

I was told to recruit a fellow classmate named Jesse Harrison to start training, everyone Jack & I trained had the large advantage of learning through us as coaches and didn't have to trouble shoot the things we did in the first year or so of our training. Jesse was a martial artist, and picked it up naturally. He was a great friend, team member, and training buddy for a long time. To learn flips we did private lessons at Livonia Gymnastics Academy for over a year, once a week. I finally quit wrestling because of my love of Parkour, and the large damper that it put on my training. I was great at wrestling, but I loved Parkour. It gave me the freedom I had been searching for my entire life. We started training harder and really pushing ourselves. One warm summer day I am driving, and I see an ad for Freedom Freerunning Academy on Facebook. I was ecstatic! A Parkour Gym in Michigan? No Way! Where is this place... I bet its somewhere far away. Soon after I realized that not only was this gym in my hometown, it was less than 2 miles away... I immediately cancelled all other plans and went there. I walked inside, met the owners, Dylan Borland & TJ Mckenzie, they had opened MI's 1st Parkour Gym. I trained for hours, ran up the warped wall my first try, and completed every handstand challenge I could think of. I was just 18 at this point. I was good at Parkour, this place helped lead me to greatness. Jesse & I made the ""pro team"" for the gym, it didn't meant that we were at professional level, we were good, but now we had a goal to train for, live up to the title we were given. After all, we were performing for the Pistons, booking other performances, and working as a team. Caleb, Eric, Jeremiah, Jesse, TJ. We were the Freedom 5. We were a great team. One day Dylan & TJ called a team meeting we were so excited, we weren't sure if we had booked another performance, or what the meeting could be for, but we couldn't have been more devastated, the gym, after only being open for a year, was closing. We had lost the lease agreement with the current landlord, and were being bought out by Foundations systems of Michigan. It was a blessing in disguise, 2 years later, our team had grown to 7 members, and we reopened as Phoenix Freerunning Academy in Livonia, MI. There are details that don't need to be discussed, but I loved Phoenix, I at the time had gone through my own rebirth, see 4 years ago on May 25th, I almost died in a horrific car accident. An accident that changed my life, temporarily shattered my psyche, and left me utterly confused, alienated, and feeling alone. A year goes by, its May 25th again... That night I was in the woods with my friend Mike Harp, celebrating life, we were just looking at deer, listening to the river and hanging out in the Matthaei Botanical Gardens, in Ann Arbor, it was 2am, when suddenly my phone rang, it was one of my teammates Jacob Winslow, ""TJ is at U of M hospital, he was hit by a train"". I was shocked. Why was this happening? How did I escape what could of been my death a year before, walk away unscathed, it was nothing short of a miracle. But why now? Why exactly a year later did TJ get hit by a train. What was he doing? How did his car get hit by a train! What an idiot! Was he trying to beat it? I was angry at him. I was angry at life, holding back tears, like I am right now as I write this to you. What were the chances of this? How did I end up less than 15 minutes away from him? Why wasn't I there? I had asked everyone to go to the beach that day, nobody went with me. TJ was with a girl in Ann Arbor, he was going bridge jumping at a popular spot. I don't know if he knew that the bridge was a railroad track for a still active amway. We showed up at the hospital, so many people were there for TJ. He was alive. What happened to him? TJ was hit, by a train, with his body... not in a car, the train more than grazed him, it sent him flying into the air and down into the river below. He was going back for a bag that he thought was full of important belongings. Camera & equipment, keys, wallet, phone, etc. TJ was and is an amazing athlete, but he always told us he hated rail precisions (jumping from rail to rail). Little did we know, he had a depth perception problem, how he is as amazing as of a Freerunner with a depth perception problem goes to show how good he really is. Anyways, last May I was working 3 jobs, I was teaching at a tumbling company, a gymnastics gym, and working as a busser/waiter, I met a man who gave me the opportunity of a lifetime, but wasn't able to provide the funding to fully build the gym. That is where you come in.  Our team at Movement United is doing our best to add value to people's lives, build this gym for the community, and successfully pursue the dream I have had since I was 17. To be a professional level Parkour/Freerunning Athlete and to own my own gym!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Improper cleaning and maintenance can create a buildup of makeup, dirt, dead skin cells and oil on bristles, which in turn can breed bacteria and even mold that cause breakouts, clogged pores, skin irritations and even infections. Improper cleaning and maintenance can cause bristles to degrade over time, while caked on makeup and debris hinders the brushes ability to effectively deposit makeup on your skin.</p><p>The idea for the carousel came about years ago after a skin care and makeup training class, where I learned that the most important thing about makeup is to keep your brushes clean. The trainer urged the class to come up with a way to store and dry brushes in a bristle-down position. The repeated motion of placing brushes in the traditional canister-type container drives dirt, makeup, debris and water further into the core of the brush where it becomes difficult to fully clean the bristles. And storing them in a drawer is just downright messy.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545248536/bxteensju0mfqgd8ugnz.jpg"" src=""""/>               <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545334744/jxooj2dl5opb7fbvhuli.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>The next few years would produce DIY solutions of all kinds!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545249129/djv9fig3rs9fzpw7p3rn.jpg"" src=""""/>         <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545249296/s2ny4gx57k0vjysd4fwe.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>And after years of searching in vain for a beautiful, sturdy and functional solution, I finally decided to create my own, with the help of my siblings. For months we worked on the concept. Our tenets were threefold: 1. The device must store makeup brushes in a bristle-down position, 2. It must be convenient and easy to use and clean, and  3. It must be beautiful. And after a year, we had gone from concept to design, to engineering and finally to prototype. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545250720/uq0zdi4fkewwabbjtyrz.jpg"" src=""""/>             <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545250831/pdyvce5yeoik2pzbaajm.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>The resulting Makeup Brush Carousel (seen in prototype phase rendered in 3D printed plastic) is a Patent-Pending makeup brush holder comprised of three components: A beautiful porcelain dish serves as the base to maintain balance and stability, but also catches debris from daily brush use as well as water from weekly washings. The base features a curved lip to contain stray makeup and debris, and easy wipe-away or rinse cleaning.

Improper cleaning and maintenance can create a buildup of makeup, dirt, dead skin cells and oil on bristles, which in turn can breed bacteria and even mold that cause breakouts, clogged pores, skin irritations and even infections. Improper cleaning and maintenance can cause bristles to degrade over time, while caked on makeup and debris hinders the brushes ability to effectively deposit makeup on your skin.The idea for the carousel came about years ago after a skin care and makeup training class, where I learned that the most important thing about makeup is to keep your brushes clean. The trainer urged the class to come up with a way to store and dry brushes in a bristle-down position. The repeated motion of placing brushes in the traditional canister-type container drives dirt, makeup, debris and water further into the core of the brush where it becomes difficult to fully clean the bristles. And storing them in a drawer is just downright messy.                The next few years would produce DIY solutions of all kinds!          And after years of searching in vain for a beautiful, sturdy and functional solution, I finally decided to create my own, with the help of my siblings. For months we worked on the concept. Our tenets were threefold: 1. The device must store makeup brushes in a bristle-down position, 2. It must be convenient and easy to use and clean, and  3. It must be beautiful. And after a year, we had gone from concept to design, to engineering and finally to prototype.               The resulting Makeup Brush Carousel (seen in prototype phase rendered in 3D printed plastic) is a Patent-Pending makeup brush holder comprised of three components: A beautiful porcelain dish serves as the base to maintain balance and stability, but also catches debris from daily brush use as well as water from weekly washings. The base features a curved lip to contain stray makeup and debris, and easy wipe-away or rinse cleaning. At the center of the base attaches a sturdy metal rod that smoothly spins for users to easily access various brushes. And finally, radiating from the central rotating rod are arms of varying lengths and different sized clips to which makeup brushes are mounted bristle-down. The clips are flexible in order to accommodate different sized brushes and for efficient, one-handed removal and stowage of each brush.                              Make The Bella Mela Makeup Brush Carousel part of your beauty and wellness ritual!       ABOUT US   We are sisters Rosette Gorrez (Founder and creator) and Maya Gorrez (Co-founder), and brother Ducky Gorrez (Co-founder).

Watch this brief video below to see how easy it is to start using neviscope. Its practically plug-n-play.  You can start scanning your suspected moles and spots and consult a dermatologist within 2 minutes.    Once you receive your Neviscope:
Download the Neviscope app, available on iOS and Android.
The app will educate you on the warning signs of skin cancer so you’ll know what to look out for.
The app also stores a detailed archive of your images (nevi-scans).
When you want a spot evaluated, submit a case and one of our certified dermatologists will review your submitted nevi-scans.
The dermatologist will let you know if the mole requires an immediate biopsy, or will ask you to submit a new scan after a prescribed time period.
 1 in 5 Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetimes, resulting in the death of over 12,000 people every year.    The fact is that all moles should be considered dangerous until proven otherwise.  Skin cancer isn't just a problem for the elderly or fair-skinned, all ages and skin tones are susceptible.But there's hope: early detection greatly increases chances of survival.When you want a spot evaluated, submit a case and one of our certified dermatologists will review your submitted nevi-scans. The dermatologist will let you know if the mole requires an immediate biopsy, or will ask you to submit a new scan after a prescribed time period.   Every 56 min, A Person Somewhere In The World Dies From Melanoma. Most people don’t know that even just one birthmark could cause skin cancer.Put off by the time and cost of visiting a dermatologist or oncologist, people choose not to deal with the problem. People lead busy lives and simply don’t see it as a priority. Look after your whole family, from the comfort of your home. With Neviscope. We all understand the dangerous of the sun. It’s no secret that prolonged exposure to UV rays leads to sunburn and increases the risk of skin cancer. It’s common knowledge that protecting your and your baby’s skin with sunscreen is especially important.But did you know that many sunscreens contain chemical ingredients that may have adverse health effects for you and your little one?  That’s why we created Nevicream SPF50!
 Its a mineral sunscreen and it is just what it sounds like — a sunscreen that uses minerals as its active ingredients. The minerals most often used are zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. Both of these ingredients occur naturally.Mineral sunscreens are sometimes called physical sunscreens because they provide a physical barrier between your skin and the sun’s rays. Think of these minerals as millions of tiny mirrors resting on the surface of your skin, bouncing away harmful UV rays.  Nevicream contains Hydromanil, Provitamin D3, Coconut Oil & Physavie®.
 
Protects skin against infrared rays and visible light.
Captures and retains water and assimilates it into the skin in an immediate and natural way.
Immediate and long-lasting moisturizing action.
Regulation of skin desquamation.
Improves the sensorial properties.
Complementary activity: anti-aging.
Helps with Skin cells regeneration and repair damage; essentially upping the skin’s resilience, strengthening its barrier, and evening out tone and texture.
Helps to make skin smooth & soft.
 NeviCream is great for everyone.You, your baby, pregnant women and for coral reefs.                        Our prototype is fully functional. (See project video to see neviscope in action).Our team has been working on Neviscope since 2015, working on prototypes, trying out various materials and we have successfully found our winning candidate.

<p>Like all devices for our pets, use positive reinforcement to introduce Mira-Pet to your dog. We recommend familiarizing your dog with the toothbrush slowly and rewarding with treats. This way, along with the silent and vibration-free design, your dog will remain calm while you clean their teeth.

<p>When comparing a standard (manual or sonic) brush for pets, professionals comment on the ineffectiveness of the standard brush in working to prevent a build up of tartar. On a secondary note, pets do not accept moving or rotating brushes, therefore making the use of a standard brush almost completely ineffective.</p>
<p>Mira-Pet comes with a Three-Sided interchangeable brush head for quick and more effective cleaning. At 60 million oscillations/minute, the ultrasound technology (accelerated air motion vibrations), gently cleans away bacteria from deep in the gum pockets.</p>

<p><b>Specifically Formulated Toothpaste</b></p>
<p>Overbrushing is a major cause of what wears down the enamel on your pet's teeth and results in irritated gums. The specifically formulated symbiotic Ultrasound toothpaste for Mira-Pet is made without any abrasive particles, thus eliminating the risk of damage to your pet's enamel.

Introducing a breakthrough oral hygiene technology that is solving the #1 health problem of dogs. It's a fact that 80% of all dogs over the age of three, suffer from periodontitis (Inflammation of the gums due to tartar build-up). Without a viable solution to this tooth cleaning & inflammation problem, over time a lack or poor oral hygiene can lead to the damage of internal organs and reduce the quality of life for your pet.

 
Mira-Pet is an affordable and convenient vibration-free and silent oral hygiene solution that allows you to care for your pet's oral health at home, without the need of expensive and uncomfortable vet visits.
The Mira-Pet toothbrush utilizes ultrasound technology combined with the specially designed toothpaste to clean deeper than the gums, destroying bacteria on the plaque over the teeth and in the gum pockets. Our unique design and function allows pet owners an oral heath solution to tartar build up and inflammation prevention.

 
 

Caring for your pet's gums is vital to preventing periodontitis and prolonging their oral health. Mira-Pet cleans the upper and lower jaw area in as little as 45-60 seconds, killing bacteria and eliminating the build up of tartar formation. Preventing serious medical and cosmetic problems for your pet is now simple, affordable and painless. At present, there is no established market leader for a brush of this kind and many pet owners have been left wondering if there really is a better solution for dealing with severe periodontal problems than what has traditionally been made available. Years of research and real world testing behind Mira-Pet have confirmed that it is a product which has your pet's interests at the top of mind.

 
By supporting us, you'll help our campaign put funds into production and make Mira-Pet available to all pet owners. An effective solution for deep cleaning and tartar removal, our product is backed by an award winning developed team, who have 50 years of ultrasonic device and dental experience.

 


Like all devices for our pets, use positive reinforcement to introduce Mira-Pet to your dog. We recommend familiarizing your dog with the toothbrush slowly and rewarding with treats. This way, along with the silent and vibration-free design, your dog will remain calm while you clean their teeth. You can find out more about positive reinforcement here.
 
Ultrasound reaches deeper than any other toothbrush can – it can penetrate tissue and also clean even inside gum pockets

When comparing a standard (manual or sonic) brush for pets, professionals comment on the ineffectiveness of the standard brush in working to prevent a build up of tartar. On a secondary note, pets do not accept moving or rotating brushes, therefore making the use of a standard brush almost completely ineffective.
Mira-Pet comes with a Three-Sided interchangeable brush head for quick and more effective cleaning. At 60 million oscillations/minute, the ultrasound technology (accelerated air motion vibrations), gently cleans away bacteria from deep in the gum pockets.


 
 
 
Specifically Formulated Toothpaste
Overbrushing is a major cause of what wears down the enamel on your pet's teeth and results in irritated gums. The specifically formulated symbiotic Ultrasound toothpaste for Mira-Pet is made without any abrasive particles, thus eliminating the risk of damage to your pet's enamel. The difference in the toothpaste is in the billions of microscopic nano bubbles that are created when used in combination with air oscillations. These nano bubbles, roughly 150x thinner than a human hair, work through the smallest crevices on the enamel, clearing away any microscopic particles.
 
Toothpaste with nano-bubble technology
Well cared for oral health will prolong the life of your pet. A healthier dogs means a higher quality of life, less vet bills and happier dog owners. Techmira AG is committed to the development of the Mira-Pet and excited to introduce its vibration-free oral hygiene solution for your pet's perio problems.

<h3>
<strong>My name</strong> is Elizabeth Stewart, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist in San Jose, CA and Founder/President of Kingdom Family Resources, a Community based Mental Health Service. From 1990 to 2012 I worked within Silicon Valley's  Santa Clara County as well as in Tulsa Ok, providing Mental Health support and facilitating in home services to kids and families involved in the Juvenile Justice System, Department of Children and Family Services, County Mental Health Services, Drug Rehabilitation services, and Psychiatric Hospital Services. What I found to be most effective is helping families in the environment they are struggling in vs. a child coming to the office for therapy and then returning home back to the same way of family functioning. How can a child work at changing his behavior if the environment has no change? This is why doing therapy with the Family in the environment is more effective and sustainable than a child coming to the office for therapy.  Often the child would be identified as the problem vs. the problem being the problem, thus pushing the child and family further into a hole that seemed to have no hope. In 2012 Kingdom Family Resources was incorporated with our vision of ""Restore a heart, Restore a family, Transform lives for a lifetime"".  We are here to help families look at the problem that is infecting the family and focus on treating the infection instead of labeling the person. This campaign is vital to helping families receive this level of support together in a safe environment that will provide education, skill building, resources, and fun. Most families that are in crisis or striving to have a sense of wellness often are not able to experience healing and peace because their approach to addressing the problem is not working.  We need to help families learn how to address the ""infection"" in a way that decreases stress, brings relief, and allows the family to hope again. Your support will provide opportunities for families to come  away from this camp with a renewed strength and hope, and we need your support to make this happen!  This is a rare occasion where a family can receive this level of support together for a weekend -guaranteed to change the life of a family. </h3>

</div></div>","My name is Elizabeth Stewart, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist in San Jose, CA and Founder/President of Kingdom Family Resources, a Community based Mental Health Service. From 1990 to 2012 I worked within Silicon Valley's  Santa Clara County as well as in Tulsa Ok, providing Mental Health support and facilitating in home services to kids and families involved in the Juvenile Justice System, Department of Children and Family Services, County Mental Health Services, Drug Rehabilitation services, and Psychiatric Hospital Services. What I found to be most effective is helping families in the environment they are struggling in vs. a child coming to the office for therapy and then returning home back to the same way of family functioning. How can a child work at changing his behavior if the environment has no change? This is why doing therapy with the Family in the environment is more effective and sustainable than a child coming to the office for therapy.  Often the child would be identified as the problem vs. the problem being the problem, thus pushing the child and family further into a hole that seemed to have no hope. In 2012 Kingdom Family Resources was incorporated with our vision of ""Restore a heart, Restore a family, Transform lives for a lifetime"".  We are here to help families look at the problem that is infecting the family and focus on treating the infection instead of labeling the person. This campaign is vital to helping families receive this level of support together in a safe environment that will provide education, skill building, resources, and fun. Most families that are in crisis or striving to have a sense of wellness often are not able to experience healing and peace because their approach to addressing the problem is not working.  We need to help families learn how to address the ""infection"" in a way that decreases stress, brings relief, and allows the family to hope again. Your support will provide opportunities for families to come  away from this camp with a renewed strength and hope, and we need your support to make this happen!  This is a rare occasion where a family can receive this level of support together for a weekend -guaranteed to change the life of a family.

The Impact
Why are we having a Therapeutic camp?
We want to be PROACTIVE and educate families about PROTECTIVE factors that can ultimately spare the next generation from repeating destructive cycles and life controlling dsyfunctions. And if the family is coming to camp with Trauma then they are at the right place to learn how to heal and move forward.

It's a time for families to be together in 1 setting receiving therapeutic support, education, and healing
It provides a time for families to refocus, regroup, and get back on track with living their best lives
Families that are healthy and productive are able to provide stability to the community.

60% of adults report experiencing abuse or other difficult family circumstances duringchildhood. 
26% of children in the United States will witness or experience a traumatic eventbefore they turn four. 
Four of every 10 children in American say they experienced a physical assault during the past year, with one in 10 receiving an assault-related injury.

Biplate's patent pending design has hundreds of oil collecting pockets and improves the health of your food without affecting the taste.
You can reduce up to 32 calories from each meal, that's roughly 90 calories a day!


 





We already opened the tooling and completed our first 200 Biplate units.
Those first 200 units were shipped to us and are already in our hands, we are shipping to media influencers and to our first 100 backers before the campaign ends. The rest of the Biplate units will be completed mid Feb.

<div>Three of the ten most prevalent causes of mortality are lung-related illnesses. Since 2004, the Human Powered Nebulizer has been a product created by Lars Olson, associate professor and interim chair of biomedical engineering at Marquette University, to provide respiratory medical assistance to those who can not easily reach treatment.</div>
<div>In many countries, especially in Central America, it can take hours to travel to a medical clinic to receive the proper medical treatment. With the Human Powered Nebulizer, people can receive treatments from a trained professional in their home without worrying about using any electricity.</div>

<br/>
</div>
<div>Over the past ten years, Lars Olson has worked with numerous engineers, completed clinical trials and a field test on the Human Powered Nebulizer. There are currently 14 nebulizers in use El Salvador with plans to expand to Guatemala. The technology and science behind the nebulizer is proven, now we just needs to funds to assemble and ship more nebulizers to those in need.</div>
<div>The members of this campaign are Shannen Oesterreich, Stephanie Melendrez and Dan Paulmeyer. We are seniors at Marquette University who are working with Lars Olson who is the founder of the Human Nebulizer Project and is a member of Marquette's College of Engineering.</div>

<div>
<h3>Why We Care</h3>
<div>During my junior and senior year of high school, I went on mission trips with my high school to Jamaica and Costa Rica respectively. On these trips, I spent time in small, rural communities such as the ones where the Human Powered Nebulizers are used. Things such as electricity and running water were considered luxuries to the members of those communities. Those trips opened my eyes to the world and the conditions that others face in meeting their most basic needs.</div>

</div>
<div>I witnessed firsthand the need for a product such as the Human Powered Nebulizer. This is a device that is proven and can bring real relief to those in need. Throughout my life and during my time at Marquette, I have been taught about the importance of giving back in any way that you can. I ask you just take the five minutes to learn about this project and consider helping any way you can. That can be a donation but also can be just emailing this link to a friend who is interested.

I've always been passionate about global health, medicine and everything that has to do with making a difference in the world. Before working on this campaign, I didn't know that 3 out of the 10 most prevalent causes of mortality are lung related. I also didn't know that the university I am currently attending was involved in such an amazing cause. It's always good to know that there are people working very hard to help those who need it most. </div>
<div>Working with someone so down-to-earth like Lars and everything he is doing to advance this campaign is inspiring. Sitting in his office listening to his stories about his trips to El Salvador made me realize that there are many places who are unfortunately deprived of immediate medical attention. I can't imagine having a hard time to breathe and having to travel to a clinic for an hour or more just to get treated. The Human Powered Nebulizer is a great medical device that can help make it easier for low-income countries treat those who suffer from lung related illnesses.

<p>Our SmartCardio device includes a hardware package in the form of a miniature wireless 12-channel electrocardiograph and a plethysmograph, as well as a software package for expert handling of incoming signals in real time. The system recognizes ECG and plethysmogram irregularities and makes an early diagnosis. A final diagnosis is completed by qualified doctors, who are cardiology specialists. The algorithms of cardiogram and plethysmogram recognition are original and previously unused. This is why it was possible to come up with such a system. The applicable algorithms may be successfully used in areas of technology which require the processing of non-stationary signals. Miniature ECG and plethysmographs are designed with modern technology to be state-of-the-art devices in the world of portable electronics, and are a part of the current direction in “digital health”, meaning that they are autonomous and completely wireless as well as integrated into the system “Machine Man”. In addition to the fact that continuous health control is ensured, SmartCardio is very comfortable to use. In case of an emergency, the system automatically notifies all participants of the emergency, and qualified physicians can connect to help determine the diagnosis.<br/></p>

SmartCardio will use a new audio format for recording and analyzing the sounds of the heart muscle. Thus, it is closely linked to the cardiologist. It is will allow real-time tracking of the health of the user.

- If I have a deviation will the device constantly be sending me notifications about it?
No. Alerts and warnings will come only if we find a deviation from the model of your ECG, which will be recorded in the standby state. It will be stored on the server and used for analysis.
- If I use SmartCardio, will emergency personnel or family be able to find me?
Yes. The important people will be able to track the location of the patient through a mobile application. This is done so that in an emergency they can quickly find you.








If SmartCardio is not for you - maybe you have family and friends who can benefit from it? Please share on your Facebook, tweet on Twitter - every share is heartily appreciated! You can share through links at the top this page or through our SmartCardio page. You just might save a life!

<p>(Please watch the video above)</p><p><b>A profound and glaring need...</b></p><p>Hi.  My name is
Brandon.  I’m a recovering addict.</p>
<p>Thanks to working the 12 steps, I have been sober from drugs
and alcohol for over 2 years.  I’m very
fortunate to live in a place with regular 12 step meetings.  Others are not so lucky.  Many cannot access meetings at all.  And still others who live in places with
frequent meetings cannot attend when they need it most.</p>
<p>Wecovery addresses this profound and glaring need by
offering recovering addicts access to the power of a 12 step meeting at any
time from anywhere.</p>
<p>The idea is simple. 
Wecovery is an app that resides on a person’s phone.  A recovering addict in need of a meeting can
use the app to share about their current situation just as they would in a 12
step meeting.  Then they can choose to
listen to other addicts’ shares and relate to them, reminding them that they
are not alone.</p>
<p>Addiction is an isolating disease.  12 step recovery offers a collective
solution, based on interpersonal connections.</p>
<p>Wecovery forges these connections across the globe, putting
the power of a 12 step meeting in a person’s pocket.</p>
<p>You have the opportunity to shape human history, helping to
fight the scourge of addiction on a scale that has never before been
possible.  Whether your own life has been
touched by this disease or you want to be part of a positive movement with the
potential to impact millions of lives, please join me.</p>
<p>We’re all in this together.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>Answers</b></p>
<p>Here are the answers to some questions you may have.  If you have a question you don’t see the
answer to below, please feel free to contact me at <a href=""mailto:brandonp@wecovery.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">brandonp@wecovery.org</a></p><p><a href=""mailto:brandonp@wecovery.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><br/></a></p>
<p><b>Funding</b></p>
<ul><li>
<span><span></span></span>Why would I support Wecovery if I’m not an
addict?</li></ul>
<p>Chances are, you know and care for someone who is struggling
with addiction.  According to the 2010
National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 23.5 million Americans are addicted to
alcohol and drugs.  That’s approximately
1 in every 10 Americans over the age of 12. 
And that’s only substance addictions. 
Taking into account all other addictions, the percentage of the
population becomes staggeringly high.</p>
<p>Even in the off chance that you don’t personally know an
addict, you have the opportunity to be a part of something that can truly help
people on a tremendous scale.  Addiction
had plagued humankind for centuries. 
Now, using the power of technology, we can come together to fight it in
a way that has never before been possible. 
Who wouldn’t want to be a part of human history?</p>
<ul><li>
<span><span></span></span>What is the funding for?</li></ul>
<p>Your contributions will go towards the development,
marketing, and initial launch of the app. 
The more expensive items include:</p>
<p><span>o<span> 
</span></span>Coding / programming</p>
<p><span>o<span> 
</span></span>Functionality and layout</p>
<p><span>o<span> 
</span></span>User experience design</p>
<p><span>o<span> 
</span></span>Marketing</p>
<p><span>o<span> 
</span></span>Secure data warehousing</p>
<ul><li>
<span><span></span></span>May I contribute anonymously?</li></ul><p>Yes, simply write ""Anonymous"" in the name field.  Thank you for your contribution!<br/></p><ul><li>How will Wecovery make money?</li></ul>
<p>The purpose of Wecovery is not to make money but to get this
tool into the hands of the people who need it as soon as possible.  Your contributions are essential to making
that happen.</p>
<p>As the Wecovery community grows, we will look to more
traditional means of monetization to support and sustain the app’s maintenance
and growth.</p>
<p>There are no plans to charge users for the app.  We hope to provide Wecovery for free to the
people who need it.</p>
<ul><li>
<span><span></span></span>This seems like a good candidate for venture
capital.  Why not go that route?</li></ul>
<p>We may, if we cannot raise adequate funding on
Indiegogo.  But venture capital comes
with strings attached.  And the biggest
string is an emphasis on profitability. 
Again, Wecovery is about helping people who are struggling from
addiction.  This is our primary
purpose.  We’d rather not muddy that.</p>
<ul><li>
<span><span></span></span>I can’t afford to contribute, but I’d still like
to help.</li></ul>
<p>No worries!  Please
help by getting the word out and sharing this campaign with your personal
network.  You can post on Facebook,
Twitter, or by using the Indiegogo share tools. 
And if you’re in recovery, please feel free to mention this campaign to
your fellows.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>How Wecovery works</b></p>
<ul><li>
<span><span></span></span>What types of addiction will Wecovery.org
support?</li></ul>
<p>Wecovery.org will support people suffering from all types of
addictions – from alcohol and drugs, to sex and gambling, to codependency and
overeating.  Addiction is addiction is
addiction.  That is why only one of the
12 steps mentions the addicts’ specific addiction.  If you are working a 12 step program,
Wecovery is meant to help you, whatever your addiction may be.</p>
<ul><li>
<span><span></span></span>Does this mean I will have to hear shares that
aren’t relevant to my situation?</li></ul>
<p>People will be able to self-identify their addictions and to
categorize their shares by addiction. 
So, if you are an alcoholic you can sort by shares from other
alcoholics, etc.</p>
<ul><li>
<span><span></span></span>What about trolls?</li></ul>
<p>Trolls are an unfortunate nuisance in any online community.  This community will be self-policed, meaning
that people will be able to flag shares that have inappropriate content or “cross
talk.”  Flagged shares will be reviewed
by the folks at Wecovery and taken down if they are in violation of the
community’s basic rules.</p>
<ul><li>
<span><span></span></span>What is “cross talk?”</li></ul>
<p>Cross talk is defined as referring to or commenting on what
another person has shared.</p>
<ul><li>
<span><span></span></span>Will members be able to “like” someone else’s
share?</li></ul>
<p>No.  This is not
Facebook.  The point of Wecovery is for
addicts to share sincerely from the heart like they would in real
meetings.  Adding “likes,” or “views,” or
the number of “shares” may encourage inauthenticity – and that wouldn’t help
anyone.</p>
<p>Members will, however, be able to “share a share” with
someone else in the community if they feel a friend can relate to it.  As mentioned above, the number of times a
share is shared will not be visible.</p>
<ul><li>
<span><span></span></span>Is Wecovery affiliated with AA?</li></ul>
<p>Wecovery is not affiliated with Alcoholics Anonymous or any
other 12 step program. We are grateful to AA and the other 12 step fellowships
for the services they provide.</p>
<ul><li>
<span><span></span></span>Is Wecovery meant to replace in-person meetings?</li></ul>
<p>No.  Nothing can
replace the magic that happens during an in-person meeting.  Wecovery is meant to supplement it, and to
offer an option for folks who can’t make a meeting when they really need one.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>Privacy and anonymity
concerns</b></p>
<ul><li>
<span><span></span></span>What if someone recognizes my voice or identity?</li></ul>
<p>For addicts who are worried about this, there will be an
option to alter the tone of your voice.</p>
<p>However, the chances of your coworkers, clergymen, or
neighbors trying to find you on Wecovery are akin to them showing up outside
your next 12 step meeting to see who walks in the door.</p>
<ul><li>
<span><span></span></span>Will members be able to delete their shares if
they wish?</li></ul>
<p>Yes, members will be able to access and delete their past
shares if they would like to do so.</p>
<ul><li>
<span><span></span></span>Won’t people be ashamed to have a recovery app
on their phones?</li></ul>
<p>Secrecy and shame are two of addiction’s greatest
weapons.  Recovering from addiction is
one of the hardest things a person can do in life.  It is something to be proud of.  Wecovery is meant to lend a voice to the
people struggling in the shadows, to give them a sense of pride in their
miraculous accomplishments, and to dissolve the power of shame and secrecy.</p>
<ul><li>
<span><span></span></span>What personal information is required?</li></ul>
<p>The only information you are required to provide is a first
name and last initial.  Ideally, these
will be real, but you are free to use any name. 
We want to make it as easy as possible for recovering addicts to sign up
and get the help they need.</p>
<p>We will ask that you voluntarily identify your addiction,
sobriety date, and location so we can keep track of our community to best
respond to its specific needs.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>The 12 steps</b></p>
<ul><li>
<span><span></span></span>I thought 12 step groups don’t work, that people
in them don’t stay sober.</li></ul>
<p>Incorrect.  We’ve seen
hundreds of men and women who have been freed from the shackles of addiction by
going to meetings and working the 12 steps of recovery.  Just like with everything else in life, you
get out of it what you put in.  Or, in 12
step vernacular, “It works if you work it.” 
Wecovery offers a tool to help recovering addicts work it.</p>
<p>You may know people who have gone to 12 step meetings and
gotten sober for a period of time “only to relapse.”  It’s unfortunate that this is viewed as
failure.  What about the period of time
during which the addict stayed clean? 
Any single sober day for an addict is a miracle in itself.  12 step programs deliver these miracles on a
daily basis all over the world.</p>
<ul><li>
<span><span></span></span>Aren’t 12 step groups religious?</li></ul>
<p>No.  12 step groups
are not affiliated with any religion.  In
the 2<sup>nd</sup> Step, recovering addicts “Came to believe that a power
greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.”  This Higher Power need only be something that
is not the addict’s self-will.  Often, it
is the group itself- in AA, folks frequently quip that GOD stands for Group of
Drunks.  For others with more religious
backgrounds, a Higher Power may take on a more traditional image of God
according to their religious traditions. 
Every 12 step group member is encouraged to define his or her own
version of spirituality.</p>
<ul><li>
<span><span></span></span>Where can I find more information on the 12
steps?</li></ul>
<p>Here’s a good starting point: <a href=""http://www.12step.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.12step.org/</a></p><p><a href=""http://www.12step.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><br/></a></p>
<p>Finally, to quote Mother Teresa:</p>
<p><i>At the end of life we
will not be judged by how many diplomas we have received, how much money we
have made, how many great things we have done.<br/>
We will be judged by ""I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat, I
was naked and you clothed me. I was homeless, and you took me in.”</i></p>
<p>This is your opportunity to make a difference.  Please take it.</p>
<p>Thank you for your service.</p>

fortunate to live in a place with regular 12 step meetings.  Others are not so lucky.  Many cannot access meetings at all.  And still others who live in places with
frequent meetings cannot attend when they need it most.
Wecovery addresses this profound and glaring need by
offering recovering addicts access to the power of a 12 step meeting at any
time from anywhere.
The idea is simple. 
Wecovery is an app that resides on a person’s phone.  A recovering addict in need of a meeting can
use the app to share about their current situation just as they would in a 12
step meeting.  Then they can choose to
listen to other addicts’ shares and relate to them, reminding them that they
are not alone.
Addiction is an isolating disease.  12 step recovery offers a collective
solution, based on interpersonal connections.
Wecovery forges these connections across the globe, putting
the power of a 12 step meeting in a person’s pocket.
You have the opportunity to shape human history, helping to
fight the scourge of addiction on a scale that has never before been
possible.  Whether your own life has been
touched by this disease or you want to be part of a positive movement with the
potential to impact millions of lives, please join me.
We’re all in this together.
Answers
Here are the answers to some questions you may have.  If you have a question you don’t see the
answer to below, please feel free to contact me at brandonp@wecovery.org
Funding

Why would I support Wecovery if I’m not an
addict?
Chances are, you know and care for someone who is struggling
with addiction.  According to the 2010
National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 23.5 million Americans are addicted to
alcohol and drugs.  That’s approximately
1 in every 10 Americans over the age of 12. 
And that’s only substance addictions. 
Taking into account all other addictions, the percentage of the
population becomes staggeringly high.
Even in the off chance that you don’t personally know an
addict, you have the opportunity to be a part of something that can truly help
people on a tremendous scale.  Addiction
had plagued humankind for centuries. 
Now, using the power of technology, we can come together to fight it in
a way that has never before been possible. 
Who wouldn’t want to be a part of human history?

What is the funding for?
Your contributions will go towards the development,
marketing, and initial launch of the app. 
The more expensive items include:
o 
Coding / programming
o 
Functionality and layout
o 
User experience design
o 
Marketing
o 
Secure data warehousing

May I contribute anonymously?Yes, simply write ""Anonymous"" in the name field.  Thank you for your contribution!How will Wecovery make money?
The purpose of Wecovery is not to make money but to get this
tool into the hands of the people who need it as soon as possible.  Your contributions are essential to making
that happen.
As the Wecovery community grows, we will look to more
traditional means of monetization to support and sustain the app’s maintenance
and growth.
There are no plans to charge users for the app.  We hope to provide Wecovery for free to the
people who need it.

This seems like a good candidate for venture
capital.  Why not go that route?
We may, if we cannot raise adequate funding on
Indiegogo.  But venture capital comes
with strings attached.  And the biggest
string is an emphasis on profitability. 
Again, Wecovery is about helping people who are struggling from
addiction.  This is our primary
purpose.  We’d rather not muddy that.

I can’t afford to contribute, but I’d still like
to help.
No worries!  Please
help by getting the word out and sharing this campaign with your personal
network.  You can post on Facebook,
Twitter, or by using the Indiegogo share tools. 
And if you’re in recovery, please feel free to mention this campaign to
your fellows.
How Wecovery works

What types of addiction will Wecovery.org
support?
Wecovery.org will support people suffering from all types of
addictions – from alcohol and drugs, to sex and gambling, to codependency and
overeating.  Addiction is addiction is
addiction.  That is why only one of the
12 steps mentions the addicts’ specific addiction.  If you are working a 12 step program,
Wecovery is meant to help you, whatever your addiction may be.

Does this mean I will have to hear shares that
aren’t relevant to my situation?
People will be able to self-identify their addictions and to
categorize their shares by addiction. 
So, if you are an alcoholic you can sort by shares from other
alcoholics, etc.

What about trolls?
Trolls are an unfortunate nuisance in any online community.  This community will be self-policed, meaning
that people will be able to flag shares that have inappropriate content or “cross
talk.”  Flagged shares will be reviewed
by the folks at Wecovery and taken down if they are in violation of the
community’s basic rules.

What is “cross talk?”
Cross talk is defined as referring to or commenting on what
another person has shared.

Will members be able to “like” someone else’s
share?
No.  This is not
Facebook.  The point of Wecovery is for
addicts to share sincerely from the heart like they would in real
meetings.  Adding “likes,” or “views,” or
the number of “shares” may encourage inauthenticity – and that wouldn’t help
anyone.
Members will, however, be able to “share a share” with
someone else in the community if they feel a friend can relate to it.  As mentioned above, the number of times a
share is shared will not be visible.

Is Wecovery affiliated with AA?
Wecovery is not affiliated with Alcoholics Anonymous or any
other 12 step program. We are grateful to AA and the other 12 step fellowships
for the services they provide.

Is Wecovery meant to replace in-person meetings?
No.  Nothing can
replace the magic that happens during an in-person meeting.  Wecovery is meant to supplement it, and to
offer an option for folks who can’t make a meeting when they really need one.
Privacy and anonymity
concerns

What if someone recognizes my voice or identity?
For addicts who are worried about this, there will be an
option to alter the tone of your voice.
However, the chances of your coworkers, clergymen, or
neighbors trying to find you on Wecovery are akin to them showing up outside
your next 12 step meeting to see who walks in the door.

Will members be able to delete their shares if
they wish?
Yes, members will be able to access and delete their past
shares if they would like to do so.

Won’t people be ashamed to have a recovery app
on their phones?
Secrecy and shame are two of addiction’s greatest
weapons.  Recovering from addiction is
one of the hardest things a person can do in life.  It is something to be proud of.  Wecovery is meant to lend a voice to the
people struggling in the shadows, to give them a sense of pride in their
miraculous accomplishments, and to dissolve the power of shame and secrecy.

What personal information is required?
The only information you are required to provide is a first
name and last initial.  Ideally, these
will be real, but you are free to use any name. 
We want to make it as easy as possible for recovering addicts to sign up
and get the help they need.
We will ask that you voluntarily identify your addiction,
sobriety date, and location so we can keep track of our community to best
respond to its specific needs.
The 12 steps

I thought 12 step groups don’t work, that people
in them don’t stay sober.
Incorrect.  We’ve seen
hundreds of men and women who have been freed from the shackles of addiction by
going to meetings and working the 12 steps of recovery.  Just like with everything else in life, you
get out of it what you put in.  Or, in 12
step vernacular, “It works if you work it.” 
Wecovery offers a tool to help recovering addicts work it.
You may know people who have gone to 12 step meetings and
gotten sober for a period of time “only to relapse.”  It’s unfortunate that this is viewed as
failure.  What about the period of time
during which the addict stayed clean? 
Any single sober day for an addict is a miracle in itself.  12 step programs deliver these miracles on a
daily basis all over the world.

Aren’t 12 step groups religious?
No.  12 step groups
are not affiliated with any religion.  In
the 2nd Step, recovering addicts “Came to believe that a power
greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.”  This Higher Power need only be something that
is not the addict’s self-will.  Often, it
is the group itself- in AA, folks frequently quip that GOD stands for Group of
Drunks.  For others with more religious
backgrounds, a Higher Power may take on a more traditional image of God
according to their religious traditions. 
Every 12 step group member is encouraged to define his or her own
version of spirituality.

Where can I find more information on the 12
steps?
Here’s a good starting point: http://www.12step.org/
Finally, to quote Mother Teresa:
At the end of life we
will not be judged by how many diplomas we have received, how much money we
have made, how many great things we have done.
We will be judged by ""I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat, I
was naked and you clothed me. I was homeless, and you took me in.”
This is your opportunity to make a difference.  Please take it.
Thank you for your service.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<br/>
</h3><h3>Unfortunately
few hours after he came to this world, he was diagnozed with a life
threatening heart defect. Open heart surgery and multpile threatments
have not been able to remove the defect entirely. Voytus has been
disqualified for further threatment in Poland due to the level of
complicity of the defect.

suffers from Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD), Major Aortopulmonary
Collateral Artery (MAPCAS) and Angina Pectoris (AP), Tricuspid
Atresia.</h3>
<h3>Voytus
was born 15<sup>th</sup> of December 2013 in Boleslawiec, Poland. The
complications with his health started within the first hours of his
short life. After first assesments he received 10 points on Apgar
scale, however shortly after that the color of his skin terrified us
and the doctors recognized that his body was obviously lacking
oxygene, significant decrease in saturation was discovered. He had to
be attached to respiratory machinery. This same day Voytus had been
transported to another hospital where the heart defect has been
diagnozed. 
</h3>
<h3> On
23.12.2013 in Zabrze (Poland) he had a major surgery on open heart.

operation was done on 27.01.2014. This time an improvement was
achieved, Voytus could finally start eating from bottle, instead of a
tube. He started gaining strenght, but in the meantime it turned out
that other problems appeared. He had to be operated again due to lack
of pulse in his dorsalis pedis artery (dorsal artery of foot).</h3>
<h3>Voytus
spent another 2 months in hospital in Wroclaw. On 05.02.2014 He was
qualified for further surgical treatment and placed on a waiting list

not manage to expand the artery and Voytus was dismissed form the
hospital with another apointment date 6 months later.</h3>
<h3>17.11.2014
two catheterization and angioplasty procedures were carried out again
in Zabrze. This time Voytus spent 2 weeks in the hospital. I will add

equipment and specialists in Poland to help our son.</h3>

</div></div>","Short Summary 
Flood Water Roller Derby needs a home and YOU can help!
For the past 4 years the Flood has been practicing in a facility too small to bout in.  As the league continues to expand it is becoming more obvious that we have outgrown our space.  We currently have a real estate agent looking into new venues for the team, but a bigger space is going to be a more expensive place.  Here is where you come in…

What We Need & What You Get
 
Flood Water Roller Derby (FWRD) has been around for years, but has never had a home bout.  (Crazy, right?!)  Every time we compete we have to drive to our rival's turf.  All those away games aren't great for recruiting new skaters and makes it hard on our fans. 
So...
Do you want to watch exciting action packed derby bouts right here in Roseville?  Do you want to support local female athletes?  Do you like cool stuff?  
Awesome! 
Donate to our Indiegogo Fund and help us get established in a larger facility.  
Check out our perks and score yourself some swag.  It will let people know you are a true derby fan! 


What the heck is Flood Water Roller Derby?
We are so glad you asked!

FWRD is a 501c3 non-profit organization dedicated to empowering women
and children in the community. As a competitive sports league we are working to
compete on an international level. As a non-profit organization we intend to ultimately
donate 50% of our profits to other local non-profits.
Formed in 2012, FWRD
set out to create a truly democratic roller derby league with the ultimate goal
of competing in international women's flat track derby as part of the Women's Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA).  

In order to compete in
WFTDA, a league must have a regulation home bouting facility, or track. That is
what we are hoping to find and why we need your help!The Impact

Not only will you be bringing bouts closer to home than ever before, but you will also be supporting female athletes right here in Roseville! 
As a league we are home to marketing geniuses, fitness professionals, artists, entrepreneurs, teachers, military personnel and mothers.  Over the years we have seen women transform their lives through the empowerment of participation.

<p><span>Multiple Sclerosis affects approximately 400,000 people in the United States, and although research efforts continue to expand, we currently do not have a cure. This means that managing a patient's disease and improving quality of life are some of the most important aspects of treating Multiple Sclerosis. However, MS can present differently in each patient, across a wide range of symptoms and severity, making each patient's disease and treatment plan unique. Because of this variability, understanding the many aspects of MS, and monitoring trends in a patient's disease are extremely important, but also very difficult. Through the use of an app such as MS Connect, patients and physicians would be able to effectively and efficiently monitor all aspects of each patient's unique disease status, and provide a more personalized treatment plan. A more holistic and personalized plan could not only enhance patients' lives, but potentially decrease relapse occurrence and keep the disease from progressing. <span><br/></span></span></p>

<p>This app will help the hundreds of thousands of people suffering from MS. It will change how doctors and clinics care for patients with MS.

<h2>FAQ related to glo910</h2>
<h4><b>Can I use it if I am pregnant?</b></h4>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pregnant women can use it on their legs, in fact it is highly recommended, as it prevents cellulite due to fluid retention, typical during pregnancy, from occurring.Obviously, it should not be used on the abdomen during pregnancy or after childbirth for a few months, until fully recovered to its state before pregnancy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h4><b>Are there any contraindications for the use of infrared?</b></h4>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The range’s most fully featured device, the Glo910, uses infrared beams with a wavelength of 640-910 mm that penetrate the skin at different levels, helping to dissolve fat accumulated in the adipocytes as well as stimulating the creation of collagen and blood circulation.These pose no problems whatsoever, it is a perfect complement to mechanical massage, boosting its effects.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h4><b>How soon will I see the results?</b></h4>
<p>As from the first session you will notice the first results:the treated areas are less bulky, decongested. Your skin is smoother, softer.After 15 sessions, the results are intensified:the orange peel effect has been smoothed out, you outline is re contoured and more toned!</p>
<h4><b>Who is this device designed for?</b></h4>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Women</b>:<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">who, despite diets, have localized fat in specific areas such as hips/thighs or orange peel skin.They can be slim and/or lead a healthy lifestyle, but are still prone to cellulite, localized excesses and flabby skin.In spite of using cosmetics they cannot eliminate the orange peel skin.They want safe, painless results without surgery.They are experiencing intense moments such as puberty, pregnancy or menopause; causing a change in body shape.They want to have firm dense, smooth pretty skin.They like to take care of themselves but do not have the time to go to a beauty salon, undergo expensive treatment using professional machines, or who want to maintain the results achieved with a device that allows daily constant use for a long-term results.</span></p>
<p><b>Men</b>:<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">who have a healthy lifestyle (sport, balanced diet) yet fail to shift stubborn fat.They want to reshape certain parts of their body.</span></p>
<p><b>Athletes</b>:<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">who, due to the intense practice of a sport, suffer muscular stresses, contractures ... To warm up their muscles before an intense sporting activity.</span></p>
<h4>Pain management</h4>
<p>The toothed head is very useful for the treatment of lower back pain.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Does it hurt?</h4>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although massage is intense, it does not hurt.On the contrary, both during and after the session you will experience a real sense of wellbeing. If the session does hurt, then this is because the setting is incorrect, which is why it has a massage intensity regulator.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Do I have to follow a supplementary diet?</h4>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Diets rarely allow weight to be shed from the area you want.Unfortunately, cellulite is generally indifferent to diets, even the most stringent.The massage works precisely on these stubborn areas.Ideally, it is best to combine the treatment with a varied balanced diet and regular physical activity (e.g. walk 20-30 min each day, avoid using the lift and walk up the stairs, cycle, swim... in general, a few minutes of moderate aerobic exercise).</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h4>What does the eliminated fat become?</h4>

</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Do you remember in school seeing a child with a patch over
one side of their eye glasses?  Do you remember that they may have often
been alone?  This may have just been a normal child being treated for Lazy
Eye (Amblyopia).</p>
<p>Untreated,
Lazy Eye means you don’t have stereoscopic vision, which means you can’t see
effectively in three dimensions.  These children and adults learn to cope, but can you imagine not being able to play ball games well because you can't judge distance?  Further, have you considered how
important stereopsis
is
in your ability to read and interpret the expression on the faces of your loved
ones?  This is the fate of between 3 - 5% of the population who develop
Amblyopia (Lazy Eye) as a child.  </p>
<p>While
children can be treated with conventional “patching” of the good eye to force
the “Lazy Eye” to work, approximately 50-60% of children carry Amblyopia into
adult life!  </p>
<p>Amblyoptica
is a start-up company developing a new device to treat Lazy Eye
(Amblyopia).  Amblyoptica was formed by three people.  Dr Christopher
(Kit) Bunker invented the device.  He has had Lazy Eye all his life and
was told it could not be treated.  In retirement he decided to challenge
that notion.  </p>
<p>Kit
recruited Dr Ed Howell to join his team.  Ed is a vision scientist and
optometrist specialising in the treatment of children with Lazy Eye.  Dr
Stuart Hazell joined the team to bring a commercial focus to the idea that this
device could be developed and commercialised to the benefit of thousands of
people.</p>
<p>We
are developing a first of its kind medical device to treat Amblyopia in
children and adults.  We use the ‘good’ eye and the brain to teach the
amblyopic eye how to see.  </p>
<p>Dr
Kit Bunker is a retired physicist and is motivated to bring his device to
market to help the many thousands of children and adults whose lives are
impacted by Amblyopia.</p>
<p>To
help realise Kit's dream, funds you choose to contribute will be used to
progress a clinical trial to build the evidence we need to attract investors or
to find a partner to take the development and commercialisation of the device
forward.  Some of the funding will also be used to contribute to patent
costs, critical to bring this product to market.  The money you contribute
will not be used to pay any of the three founders of Amblyoptica; they will
continue to support the company with their skills and knowledge.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; How We Will Pay It Forward<br/>
</h3>
<p>Amblyoptica is seeking your support to bring a new medical
device to market.  While the concept may seem simple when you see it, it
is intended to be a professional medical device and not a home use or DIY
technology.  Therefore, it can’t be supplied without the attendant
requirement for skilled clinical input and appropriate regulatory approval to
sell the final product.  So what is Amblyoptica offering for your
support?  Amblyoptica is basing this crowd funding campaign on a pledge to
<i>Pay It Forward</i>.  We will use your support to help our mission to
bring a novel medical device to market.  When we achieve that goal, we
will pay forward $2 for every $1 we receive through this campaign.  We are
pleased the charity <i>Hear and Say</i> (<a href=""https://www.hearandsay.com.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.hearandsay.com.au/</a>) have
agreed to be our <i>partner recipient organisation</i> in this crowd funding
campaign.  </p>
<p>We
are making a pledge that when the company achieves our commercial objective of
bringing our Lazy Eye device to market and we are generating a profit, we will
give, to <i>Hear and Say,</i> $2 for every $1 contributed by our
supporters.  We will contribute these funds as quickly as possible once
the business is profitable and ahead of any dividend to future investors.</p>
<p>Your support has the potential to be amplified and keep on
giving!<br/><br/>
We have set a target of $25,000.  We have selected this amount as it will
cover costs associated with progressing a small clinical trial to advance the
proof of concept.  This includes costs associated with preparation of Ethics
Committee approval, and a level of administrative support in the management of
the trial which we aim to conduct with the support of selected optometry
practices in Australia.  There will be some reimbursement of expenses to
people who we recruit to be part of this study.  We will also use some of
the funds raised to support part of the cost associated with progressing our
patent claims.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Journey Ahead<br/>
</h3>
<p>When we
started this journey we knew it would not be easy.  The motivation for the
team was to make a difference by bringing a “first of its kind” treatment for Lazy
Eye to the people who need it; the children and adults who have been told there
are no further treatment options.<span>  Kit
has not been cured, but he now has practical </span>stereopsis with on-going
improvement of his vision.  If we can show that what Kit has achieved for himself - as validated
in Dr Howell's assessments - can translate to even a sub-set of the people who currently
have no treatment options, our efforts will be completely justified. </p>
<p>Your
contribution will help us continue our journey.  Ultimately we will need
to bring investors or strategic partners to this project.  This is because
it takes a lot of money to bring a medical device to market.  Issues such
as protecting IP, design, quality systems, regulation, manufacture costs and
marketing all represent issues that must be addressed.  You can be part of
this journey and through our Facebook page you will be able to share our
achievements and, we must say, some frustrations.<br/></p>
<h3>Our Vision And What You Can Help Us Achieve<br/>
</h3>
<p>Amblyoptica
is more than a device; it is a system that provides a device, combined with a
vision development program.  This will be underpinned by an appreciation of
critical need for all elements of the vision infrastructure to be engaged (if
we are to achieve the intention of effectively training the brain to construct
what most people perceive to be ""normal vision"").  In this
regard the expertise of Dr Ed Howell is an important element of our team.</p>
<p>While
the first functional prototype you have seen in our video is a mechanical
device, we want to progress the development of a liquid crystal display (LCD)
electronic system.  Early prototypes of the LCD system have been built and
we are now looking for LCD panels that meet our specifications prior to
advancing this development.</p>
<p>If we
are fortunate to launch one of those rare campaigns that achieve much more than
our initial target, we will work with our design company to build a device
ready for manufacture.  This will cost around $350,000.<br/></p>
<br/><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges<br/>
</h3>
</div>
<p>To
take this concept forward there are challenges and risks.  We work with a
range of professionals in areas of design, regulation and clinical development
to mitigate risk where we can.  </p>
<p>However,
we can't control all things.  The clinical trial will be a critical
test.  We have a very good understanding of the theory into why this
device will work.  However, the current data are limited to the
improvement in stereopsis
of the inventor, Dr Kit Bunker. Dr Ed
Howell is confident the technology will translate to other people and he is
working to design the study and define the working parameters for the device
needed to validate the fundamental hypothesis.  Notwithstanding, a
clinical trial is the only way we will be able to understand the full scope of
the utility of the device.  The clinical trial may show the device does
not work, or only works in a sub-set of people with Lazy Eye.  The level
of stereopsis
achieved may not meet clinical expectations.<span> 
</span>This could impact our capacity to enter the market.</p>
<p>Once
we have a device which has been registered for sale as a medical device, we
still need to educate ophthalmologists and optometrists and prove to them that
the device adds value to their treatment options.  We have a plan to
achieve this goal, but it will take time and work. </p>
<br/><div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help <br/>
</h3>
<p>If you are
unable to contribute, or if you would like to do more to help, you can support
us in simple ways.  <br/>
Consider talking with your friends and family and ask if any have had
experience with Lazy Eye.  You may be surprised at the answers you
receive!<br/>
Spread the word!<span>  Your friends and family
may be interested in supporting our campaign using the ‘’Indiegogo’’ share
tools or by liking and following us on Facebook.</span></p>

</div></div>","Chronic Disease is Out of Control!
Unfortunately mainstream medicine is losing the battle with chronic disease. Diseases like cancer, diabetes, asthma, autism, cardio vascular disease, alzheimer, depression... (I could go on) increasingly continue to affect our friends and family. 
Prevention is key...

Many of these diseases can be prevented by implementing lifestyle changes that reduce exposure, and by identifying and mitigating the products and contaminants in our homes that affect indoor quality. 



MyPiE™ stands for ""My Personal Indoor Environment. MyPiE™ is a fundamental and necessary preventative management program that supports chronically diagnosed persons in leading healthy and active lives, and supports health plans in delivering improved outcomes, improved efficiencies and environments.

With your help, we can help those who are disparately affected and lack the resources to make healthy changes and choices in their lives.


   MyPiE™ Environment Assessment Program
The MyPiE™ Environment Assessment Program provides a unique, evidence-based assessment of indoor exposure. MyPiE™ identifies and monitors levels of potentially harmful contaminants in the air of a patient’s home, work, school or place of recreation.







Evidence based testing for: 

Mold (Basic or Comprehensive)
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and Chemical Exposure

Tobacco smoke


Household products and pesticides

Building Material
Other Asthma Triggers and Allergens: dog, cat, cockroach, 1 & 2 dust mite, mouse, rat, fungal alt, fungal asp

Continuous Environment Monitoring: NOx, CO, CO2, O3, PM2.5, VOC, Humidity, Temperature (Cutting Edge!)






Our Goals...  The MyPiE™ campaign is seeking $160,000 in donations.
MyPiE Inc. (501c3) - ALL DONATIONS ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE, but more importantly, you are helping to create a healthier environment for someone in need.
Below is an example of how funds will be allocated: 





The MyPiE™ Impact


MyPiE™ Environment Assessment Program provides physicians with the necessary data to make informed patient diagnosis and treatment decisions by identifying levels of exposure/indoor triggers that often result in frightening asthma attacks, chronic disease, inflammation, avoidable emergency room visits and costly care. 





MyPiE™ Environment Assessment Program recommends actionable solutions to mitigate identified contaminants/triggers and re-assesses for air quality improvement in accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) standards and practices.



Reducing Exposure Works!

<p>Proteins
are a vital food source for the human body. However, they must be digested,
which means they must be broken up into free amino acids and short peptides
(the ‘building blocks’ of body tissue), before they can be absorbed by the
human body. Amino acids and short peptides help to reassemble new proteins,
which in turn, help cells to grow, replicate or provide energy for metabolism.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441491615/twxs8wxrsyuwcqpcumuj.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 610.6673076923076px; height: 513px;""/></p>
<div>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Proteins
are often long and complex polymer chains of specific amino acids linked
together by peptide bonds. Small proteins with only a few linked amino acids
are known as peptides.</p>
<p>The
reassembly of amino acids into the proteins required by the body is one of the
functions of cells which require the right mix of the amino acids to do this.</p>
<p>The
twenty amino acids required for the human diet can be divided into three
categories:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Nine essential amino acids which cannot be made by
the body and must be supplied by food</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Five non-essential amino acids which can be
synthesized by the body, if in short supply</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Six conditional amino acids, usually not essential,
except in times of illness, stress or serious medical conditions.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all
proteins are the same. The match between the proportions of the amino acids in
the food we eat and the proportions required by the human body is known as
protein quality. </p>
<p>Cellper®Elite
has almost perfect protein quality, providing an ideal balance of amino acids,
both essential and non-essential. The protein in Cellper®Elite has already been
broken down so that it is both easily and completely absorbed, and immediately
useful to human cells.</p>

</p>
<p><b>1 – </b><b>What is Cellper</b><b>®Elite? </b></p>
<p>Cellper®Elite is a nutritional
product containing 10 g of pure natural protein available as a complex of
essential and non essential amino acids, and micronutrients in a single 100 ml
shot intended for use in rapid muscle recovery following strenuous exercise .</p>
<p><b>2 - What’s
the science behind Cellper®Elite?</b></p>
<p>It is well recognised that
ingestion of protein following strenuous exercise enhances the repair  and recovery of muscles . However , the currently
available forms of protein all require an initial digestion step in the stomach
which can take up to 90 minutes prior to absorption by the blood stream and
supply to the muscles . </p>
<p>The critical time frame for
optimal muscle repair is within the first 30 minutes following cessation of exercise
and Cellper® has been developed to meet this critical time requirement. Cellper®
contains natural protein that has already been pre-digested to the constituent
amino acids , thereby being immediately available for absorption upon ingestion
such that the protein can reach the muscles within the critical first 30 minute
interval . </p>
<p><b>3 – Who should take it?</b></p>
<p>Cellper®Elite is
specifically for people who need to repair and build muscle mass following
anaerobic training or performance.  This
allows you to  gain maximum benefit from
your workouts and to be ready to do it again sooner.  Cellper®Elite will have little benefit and is
not recommended following light aerobic exercise designed exclusively for
weight loss.</p>
<p><b>4 – Is it suitable for vegetarians and vegans?  </b></p>
<p>Short
answer: No, it is derived from salmon so would not meet vegetarian /vegan
standards.</p>
<p>Longer
answer: It’s chemistry, all fish protein has been broken down into constituent
amino acids and micronutrients.  There
are no long proteins such as DNA remaining that would identify it as coming
from an animal source.  A lysine
molecule, for example, is just that, and it is impossible to tell if it was
previously part of a plant or an animal.  So it depends on the motivation of your vegetarianism.</p>
<p>If you are allergic to fish: do <b>not </b>take Cellper®Elite</p>
<p><b>5 – Does it contain sugar, wheat, gluten or
caffeine?  </b></p>
<p>No added sugar, no wheat, no
gluten and no caffeine.  The carbs in the
product are exclusively from the natural sugars in the fruit and
vegetable juice.  </p>
<p><b>6 - I am following a clean lifestyle. Is Cellper®Elite suitable?</b></p>
<p>Absolutely...and we are really glad to be able to say that. We purposely set out to keep the label as clean as possible. All the flavours, sweeteners and even the stabiliser we need to give Cellper®Elite it's shelf life are are completely natural.</p>
<p><b>7 – Where and when can I buy it?</b></p>
<p>Now! Here! We are running our Indiegogo campaign to help us achieve our goals over the coming month or two but, in exchange for your contribution, we are offering incredible deals on Cellper®Elite that we are unlikely to ever offer again! Any product you buy here today, whether it's the duo pak or the 12 month's worth (26 x 6-paks) will be shipped in early October.</p>
<p><b>8 – I’m a PT, can I buy some for my clients? </b></p>
<p>Many PTs give nutritional
advice to their clients, particularly with regard to obtaining the maximum
benefit from training.  Our Cellper®Elite
Ambassador programme is specifically design to help PTs do this however, we will not be starting what we call our 'Ambassador Programme' until the product goes on full sale in October. If you would like more information on this, please contact us for details: <a href=""mailto:AmbassadorProgramme@CellperElite.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>AmbassadorProgramme@CellperElite.com</span></a></p>
<p><b>9 – What’s the difference between this and whey
protein? </b></p>
<p>Firstly, Cellper®Elite is
comprised of short chain amino acids (peptides), that have been pre-digested
and are therefore readily absorbed immediately by the intestine.  By contrast whey protein is indeed that, it
is protein that first has to be digested by proteases in the intestine into
peptides thereby delaying absorption.  Secondly,
Cellper®Elite is derived from salmon protein, a very close match in amino acid
composition to human protein, whereas whey is derived from milk thereby
introducing the additional complication of lactose side effects in the
significant proportion of the population that are lactose intolerant. (NB &gt;
20% of the population are lactose intolerant, and in some ethnic groups the
levels of intolerance rise much higher) </p>

<p><b>10 – Should I take this and whey protein? </b></p>
<p>Whey protein is usually
recommended as a general protein supplement, i.e., a means of enhancing the
amount of protein in the diet.  Commercial
products often recommend consumption 3 times a day: Between breakfast and
lunch, between lunch and dinner, and after exercise.</p>
<p>Cellper®Elite is more
specific: It is designed to get nutrients to your muscles most effectively, when
you most need them, immediately post exercise.</p>
<p>Taking Cellper®Elite post
exercise, does not preclude you from taking another form of protein supplement
at another time of day if your diet would otherwise not provide enough
protein.  Healthy adults generally require
0.8g of protein per kg of body weight, athletes and body builders may need 1.2
to 2g per kg of body weight.</p>
<p><b>Reference:</b> </p>
<p>i - Protein Requirements. <a href=""http://www.nutrition.org.uk/nutritionscience/nutrients/protein.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.nutrition.org.uk</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">11 – Do I have to mix it up like I currently do?</b><br/></p>
<p>No, Cellper®Elite comes as a  100ml liquid ready to be consumed straight
from the bottle.  It is all about getting
this nutrition to your muscles as quickly as possible.  If you drink Cellper®Elite immediately after
exercise, your body is benefiting by the time you reach the shower.</p>
<p><b>12 - Will this cause bloating like I’m used to with
Whey.  </b></p>
<p>No, the bloating is a side
effect of the digestion of whole protein. Cellper®Elite is pre-digested into
short chain amino acids (peptides) requires no further digestion.  Hence no gas or bloating. </p>
<p><b>13 – What causes the bloating I experience with my
existing whey protein?</b></p>
<p>Bloating  is an uncomfortable and
tight feeling of fullness in the stomach or abdomen, which may also be
accompanied by abdominal pain and flatulence.  The abdomen becomes larger than normal
(distension) and bloating may also cause a very noticeable increase in various
noises from the gut, such as loud rumblings and gurglings.</p>
<p>The main causes of such symptoms are excess gas produced by the digestive
process.  The mixture of gases such as
oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, methane and others formed in the
gut during the digestive process can become a very unpleasant problem.
Ingestion of Whey protein and the subsequent digestion of it leads to the
production of these gases as side effects , with in some instances the swelling
of the abdomen by up to 125% . This problem is exacerbated in the &gt;20% of
the population who suffer from intolerance to the lactose present in Whey
protein. </p>

<p><b>14 - Why does Cellper®Elite contain only 10g of
protein when other products contain 20, 30 or more?</b></p>
<p>The key metric is not how much you eat, but how much you absorb. 
Cellper®Elite is in a form in which it is almost completely absorbed, requiring
no further digestion.  This contrasts sharply with conventional protein of
which healthy people typically absorb about 50% following an hour to
an hour and a half's digestion.  In this context, 10g of amino acids plus
all the micronutrients is a surge of nutrients just at the time when your
muscles most need them.</p>
<p>The average daily requirements of protein are 0.8 g per kg body weight
daily, which equates to about 56g daily, which would be ingested from a normal
healthy diet . Elite athletes and body builders have been shown to need
significantly more: 1.2 -2.0 g daily per kg body weight, which they would try
to obtain from an enhanced healthy diet. By taking Cellper®Elite as a protein
supplement comprising 10g of protein instantly absorbed, an additional  surge  of protein can be provided after strenuous
exercise to quickly repair strained and damaged muscles.</p>

<p>i- Protein Requirements. <a href=""http://www.nutrition.org.uk/nutritionscience/nutrients/protein.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.nutrition.org.uk</a></p>
<p><b>15 - Why do I need non-essential amino acids
when my body can make them?</b></p>
<p>Sure, when there is a deficit of one or more of the non-essential amino
acids, the body had mechanisms for synthesising these from other aminos. 
The more you understand cell biology the more wonderful it is!  However,

hours before enables the meal to be fully digested, so all nutrients are
available for the workout, you train hard and muscle catabolism is reduced.

provides the nutritional kick-start to recovery and muscle growth. Ideally, do both.</p>

</div>","Conventional protein sources such as whey, soy, chicken or fish all take between an hour and an hour and a half to digest and so miss the optimal recovery window. 
Serious training and exercise leaves an athlete or bodybuilder with a 30 minute window to get nutrients to the exercised muscles for optimal recovery and growth.


Cellper®Elite is
a breakthrough in sports nutrition by providing protein as a complete and
naturally balanced amino acid complex.  It is absorbed directly without the need or wait for digestion.
As a concentrated single shot of just
100ml, taken immediately after each
heavy session, Cellper®Elite provides the fastest and most effective nutrition for muscle
repair.



To pre-order Cellper®Elite and take advantage of some never to be repeated deals select a perk (these are on the right of your screen if you’re on a desktop/laptop; or click here if you're on a mobile device).




The origin of Cellper® lies in the
pioneering work of Professor Gennady Ermolin, a distinguished scientist who led
nutrition development for long-duration space travel.  This produced technology for the advanced
high protein diets essential to survival and high levels of functionality in a
demanding environment. The resultant amino acid and micronutrient complex closely
matches human requirements, is easily, quickly and almost completely absorbed.




Natural fish protein, taken from salmon, is
refined through a series of biotechnological processes into an ultra high-grade
amino acid complex which is then blended in our fruit based beverages to
produce a 100ml single shot ready to be taken immediately following a demanding
session.

Proteins
are a vital food source for the human body. However, they must be digested,
which means they must be broken up into free amino acids and short peptides
(the ‘building blocks’ of body tissue), before they can be absorbed by the
human body. Amino acids and short peptides help to reassemble new proteins,
which in turn, help cells to grow, replicate or provide energy for metabolism.



Proteins
are often long and complex polymer chains of specific amino acids linked
together by peptide bonds. Small proteins with only a few linked amino acids
are known as peptides.
The
reassembly of amino acids into the proteins required by the body is one of the
functions of cells which require the right mix of the amino acids to do this.
The
twenty amino acids required for the human diet can be divided into three
categories:



Nine essential amino acids which cannot be made by
the body and must be supplied by food


Five non-essential amino acids which can be
synthesized by the body, if in short supply


Six conditional amino acids, usually not essential,
except in times of illness, stress or serious medical conditions.


Not all
proteins are the same. The match between the proportions of the amino acids in
the food we eat and the proportions required by the human body is known as
protein quality. 
Cellper®Elite
has almost perfect protein quality, providing an ideal balance of amino acids,
both essential and non-essential. The protein in Cellper®Elite has already been
broken down so that it is both easily and completely absorbed, and immediately
useful to human cells.

1 – What is Cellper®Elite? 
Cellper®Elite is a nutritional
product containing 10 g of pure natural protein available as a complex of
essential and non essential amino acids, and micronutrients in a single 100 ml
shot intended for use in rapid muscle recovery following strenuous exercise .
2 - What’s
the science behind Cellper®Elite?
It is well recognised that
ingestion of protein following strenuous exercise enhances the repair  and recovery of muscles . However , the currently
available forms of protein all require an initial digestion step in the stomach
which can take up to 90 minutes prior to absorption by the blood stream and
supply to the muscles . 
The critical time frame for
optimal muscle repair is within the first 30 minutes following cessation of exercise
and Cellper® has been developed to meet this critical time requirement. Cellper®
contains natural protein that has already been pre-digested to the constituent
amino acids , thereby being immediately available for absorption upon ingestion
such that the protein can reach the muscles within the critical first 30 minute
interval . 
3 – Who should take it?
Cellper®Elite is
specifically for people who need to repair and build muscle mass following
anaerobic training or performance.  This
allows you to  gain maximum benefit from
your workouts and to be ready to do it again sooner.  Cellper®Elite will have little benefit and is
not recommended following light aerobic exercise designed exclusively for
weight loss.
4 – Is it suitable for vegetarians and vegans?  
Short
answer: No, it is derived from salmon so would not meet vegetarian /vegan
standards.
Longer
answer: It’s chemistry, all fish protein has been broken down into constituent
amino acids and micronutrients.  There
are no long proteins such as DNA remaining that would identify it as coming
from an animal source.  A lysine
molecule, for example, is just that, and it is impossible to tell if it was
previously part of a plant or an animal.  So it depends on the motivation of your vegetarianism.
If you are allergic to fish: do not take Cellper®Elite
5 – Does it contain sugar, wheat, gluten or
caffeine?  
No added sugar, no wheat, no
gluten and no caffeine.  The carbs in the
product are exclusively from the natural sugars in the fruit and
vegetable juice.  
6 - I am following a clean lifestyle. Is Cellper®Elite suitable?
Absolutely...and we are really glad to be able to say that. We purposely set out to keep the label as clean as possible. All the flavours, sweeteners and even the stabiliser we need to give Cellper®Elite it's shelf life are are completely natural.
7 – Where and when can I buy it?
Now! Here! We are running our Indiegogo campaign to help us achieve our goals over the coming month or two but, in exchange for your contribution, we are offering incredible deals on Cellper®Elite that we are unlikely to ever offer again! Any product you buy here today, whether it's the duo pak or the 12 month's worth (26 x 6-paks) will be shipped in early October.
8 – I’m a PT, can I buy some for my clients? 
Many PTs give nutritional
advice to their clients, particularly with regard to obtaining the maximum
benefit from training.  Our Cellper®Elite
Ambassador programme is specifically design to help PTs do this however, we will not be starting what we call our 'Ambassador Programme' until the product goes on full sale in October. If you would like more information on this, please contact us for details: AmbassadorProgramme@CellperElite.com
9 – What’s the difference between this and whey
protein? 
Firstly, Cellper®Elite is
comprised of short chain amino acids (peptides), that have been pre-digested
and are therefore readily absorbed immediately by the intestine.  By contrast whey protein is indeed that, it
is protein that first has to be digested by proteases in the intestine into
peptides thereby delaying absorption.  Secondly,
Cellper®Elite is derived from salmon protein, a very close match in amino acid
composition to human protein, whereas whey is derived from milk thereby
introducing the additional complication of lactose side effects in the
significant proportion of the population that are lactose intolerant. (NB >
20% of the population are lactose intolerant, and in some ethnic groups the
levels of intolerance rise much higher)

proteins and amino acids: Colorado State University

10 – Should I take this and whey protein? 
Whey protein is usually
recommended as a general protein supplement, i.e., a means of enhancing the
amount of protein in the diet.  Commercial
products often recommend consumption 3 times a day: Between breakfast and
lunch, between lunch and dinner, and after exercise.
Cellper®Elite is more
specific: It is designed to get nutrients to your muscles most effectively, when
you most need them, immediately post exercise.
Taking Cellper®Elite post
exercise, does not preclude you from taking another form of protein supplement
at another time of day if your diet would otherwise not provide enough
protein.  Healthy adults generally require
0.8g of protein per kg of body weight, athletes and body builders may need 1.2
to 2g per kg of body weight.
Reference: 
i - Protein Requirements. www.nutrition.org.uk

11 – Do I have to mix it up like I currently do?
No, Cellper®Elite comes as a  100ml liquid ready to be consumed straight
from the bottle.  It is all about getting
this nutrition to your muscles as quickly as possible.  If you drink Cellper®Elite immediately after
exercise, your body is benefiting by the time you reach the shower.
12 - Will this cause bloating like I’m used to with
Whey.  
No, the bloating is a side
effect of the digestion of whole protein. Cellper®Elite is pre-digested into
short chain amino acids (peptides) requires no further digestion.  Hence no gas or bloating. 
13 – What causes the bloating I experience with my
existing whey protein?
Bloating  is an uncomfortable and
tight feeling of fullness in the stomach or abdomen, which may also be
accompanied by abdominal pain and flatulence.  The abdomen becomes larger than normal
(distension) and bloating may also cause a very noticeable increase in various
noises from the gut, such as loud rumblings and gurglings.
The main causes of such symptoms are excess gas produced by the digestive
process.  The mixture of gases such as
oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, methane and others formed in the
gut during the digestive process can become a very unpleasant problem.
Ingestion of Whey protein and the subsequent digestion of it leads to the
production of these gases as side effects , with in some instances the swelling
of the abdomen by up to 125% . This problem is exacerbated in the >20% of
the population who suffer from intolerance to the lactose present in Whey
protein. 
Reference:
i - Whey Protein Allergies and Intolerances. Precision Nutrition
14 - Why does Cellper®Elite contain only 10g of
protein when other products contain 20, 30 or more?
The key metric is not how much you eat, but how much you absorb. 
Cellper®Elite is in a form in which it is almost completely absorbed, requiring
no further digestion.  This contrasts sharply with conventional protein of
which healthy people typically absorb about 50% following an hour to
an hour and a half's digestion.  In this context, 10g of amino acids plus
all the micronutrients is a surge of nutrients just at the time when your
muscles most need them.
The average daily requirements of protein are 0.8 g per kg body weight
daily, which equates to about 56g daily, which would be ingested from a normal
healthy diet . Elite athletes and body builders have been shown to need
significantly more: 1.2 -2.0 g daily per kg body weight, which they would try
to obtain from an enhanced healthy diet. By taking Cellper®Elite as a protein
supplement comprising 10g of protein instantly absorbed, an additional  surge  of protein can be provided after strenuous
exercise to quickly repair strained and damaged muscles.
Reference: 
i- Protein Requirements. www.nutrition.org.uk
15 - Why do I need non-essential amino acids
when my body can make them?
Sure, when there is a deficit of one or more of the non-essential amino
acids, the body had mechanisms for synthesising these from other aminos. 
The more you understand cell biology the more wonderful it is!  However,
compared to getting a balanced composition to start with, it is a slow and
inefficient process.
16 - I already take BCAAs and Creatine, why do I
need Cellper®Elite?
BCAAs and Creatine supplements are designed to limit muscle catabolism
during exercise and to enable you to workout harder. Cellper®Elite
is designed for consumption post exercise where the focus is on recovery and
growth.
17 - Won't I achieve the same effect as
Cellper®Elite simply by eating a protein rich meal before training?
Most trainers and nutritionists recommend eating a balanced meal, with
plenty of protein, or taking a protein supplement two to two and a half
hours before a training session.  Not later, as you may still be
expending energy digesting food and could feel nauseous as you train.  Two
hours before enables the meal to be fully digested, so all nutrients are
available for the workout, you train hard and muscle catabolism is reduced. 
At the end of the workout when these resources are depleted, Cellper®Elite
provides the nutritional kick-start to recovery and muscle growth. Ideally, do both.

<h2>                           Design</h2>Over the past year and half, the MDI team has finalized the electrical and mechanical engineering for the Orbi 1. The tooling was completed in December and it is now ready for the pilot production run in late January.  The Orbi 2 design is also now complete and production will begin in April when tooling is finalized.  The My Orbi App and website is in the final stage of development and testing and will also be ready for deployment in January.   With your help in reaching our flexible fund raising goal of $50,000, we will start production and start delivering Peace Of Mind in March of 2016 .  </div><div>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks and Challenges</h2>
<p>The traditional risks and challenges of launching new technology consumer products are significantly minimized because of the extensive product development and product marketing experience of the team at MDI.  Although MDI is a new company, the team has been creating and manufacturing technology products for the past 20 years.  We also have an incredibly capable manufacturing partner in Asia that already produces over 10 million units of micro-cellular products annually and is now ready to start production on the Orbi 1 and Orbi 2.  Our biggest challenges therefore are not in design or manufacturing, but are instead related more to the marketing of those products and the inevitable competitive forces that will emerge as we grow this new category of micro devices that allow 24/7 connection to people and things.   Although our pending patents provide some level of protection, the best defense against competitive forces is successful retail distribution and the resultant consumer awareness and loyalty.  MDI has a core competency in achieving mass retail distribution very quickly.  Our relationships with virtually all of the major retail channels in the U.S. give us a distinct advantage over other companies and will lead to very fast and very broad retail distribution on the Orbi.  The growth associated with large retail distribution also has financial and execution risks but we are confident in our ability to manage those challenges, as we have in the past.  With your help in getting the engine started, we will be able to grow Orbi to its full potential. </p>

</div><br/></div>","The Problem

Smart Phones changed our lives and connected us to each other like never before, with a disturbing exception….our young children and the elderly.   The people we care most about in our lives are the only segments of society that are not connected to us anytime, anywhere.......until now.   Parents don’t want their 3-10 year old children to have a smart phone because of the unrestricted Internet access, social skill implications,  and the expense.  The elderly don’t like the large size or complexity of smart phones.                                                             
The SolutionThe Mini Orbi Clip-Phone/Tracker is the ideal communication device and Geo tracker to protect the most important people and things in our lives…the ultimate 24/7 talk, text, track solution  for our children and elderly parents.    
The Orbi is the ultimate personal communication and tracking
device for anyone or anything.  Clip it to a key-chain, belt loop,
backpack, bike, golf bag, scooter, walker. 
Stick it to a lunch box, car, TV Remote, any flat surface.  Wear it on your wrist with the snap-on “ring
band” or attach to a pendent or jacket. 








The problem with trackers is that just knowing where
your loved ones are in an emergency is not enough.  Immediately communicating with them
is the key to their safety and your peace of Mind.                 The Ecosystem
The My Orbi App (Android and iOS) and Orbi Website developed over the past year by MDI provide a simple and intuitive way to communicate and track one or multiple Orbi's, allowing the tracking of anyone or anything.  Current location and past-24 hour locations are automatically tracked on Google Maps.   The Geo Fencing feature is also controlled from the App or Website, immediately sending alerts when preset locations are left or when a preset destination is reached.   The My Orbi App is constantly communicating with the Orbi itself, sharing contacts, text history, call history, location data, and all settings. 


Who We AreThe Orbi was developed by MDI, a silicon valley start-up company founded by Dean Finnegan.  Dean and the team at MDI have a proven track record of bringing successful technology products to market.  The Product Development and Product Marketing team have decades of cumulative experience in creating technology products and their supporting ecosystems.  During the past 9 years, this team has been directly responsible for creating three new product categories and shipped over 12 million units to U.S. consumers.  The Orbi is their latest creation.  Their relationships with the largest retailers in the U.S. are also un-precedented and as a result, the Orbi will be available in thousands of retail store fronts in 2016.

<p>The most crucial step in an anaphylaxis action plan is to immediately administer epinephrine.  But what happens if you don't have your epinephrine with you?  I can't tell you how many times I have forgotten my son's Epi at home or in the car and had to go back and search for it in a panic. If you live with life threatening allergies, you know that every second that goes by without epinephrine during a severe allergy response puts a person more at risk of death.  The statistics are terrifying.</p>

<p>With your help, Rescufy <i>Connect</i> will add some very important upgrades to the app functionality, including Bluetooth connectivity that will link the Rescufy app on your phone to your epinephrine injector.  <u>This upgrade will ensure you never leave your home or car again without this most crucial lifesaving tool</u>.  If you get outside of the acceptable range, the Rescufy app will alert you that your Epi is out of reach, and give you the reminder you need to go back and get it.  </p>
<p><strong>Rescufy <i>Connect</i> will also allow you to go on a date night or trip away without worrying (as much...) </strong></p>
<p>Let's face it.  As a parent, worrying comes with the territory.  I know from personal experience, however, that the level of worrying compounds exponentially when your child has life threatening allergies.  No one is able to take care of your child the way you do, right? </p>

<p>5 years ago, these statistics would have sounded shocking to me, but I would not fully understand the magnitude and severity of what these numbers actually mean until my son was diagnosed with a severe tree nut allergy.  My wife and I learned that day that if he ingests any type of tree nut - even the tiniest particle - our son could have an allergic reaction that, if untreated, could result in death.</p>
<p><strong>I knew there had to be an easier way to get help and peace of mind in the event of anaphylaxis. </strong></p>
<p>We needed a reliable and fast way to reach 9-1-1 and emergency contacts in the event of anaphylaxis so that we could focus on the care and comfort of our son.  I came up with the Rescufy concept to simplify the process of notifying first responders, emergency contacts, and sharing medical information, submitted it to the University of Pennsylvania's  “AppItUP” mobile application idea challenge, and was honored to win first prize.</p>

The uniqueness of my approach is the combination of rich experience and tested technical tips along with development of the right attitude and strong inner motivation to move forward. I am a supporter of the holistic approach - in order to perform your best, everything is important: training regimen, optimal nutrition, correct vitamins and supplements, positive attitude, and the development of a number of strong inner qualities. </p>

Findings that helped me not to give up and move forward during the hardest days are of particular interest. That is why, along with the outer techniques and tips that are constantly updated, I love to use ancient mantras, meditation and prayer.

</div></div>","The greater the distance one chooses to conquer, the more inner strength and the ability to rely on intuition and one's feeling is required. The uniqueness of my approach is the combination of rich experience and tested technical tips along with development of the right attitude and strong inner motivation to move forward. I am a supporter of the holistic approach - in order to perform your best, everything is important: training regimen, optimal nutrition, correct vitamins and supplements, positive attitude, and the development of a number of strong inner qualities. 
All my solutions are tested in the most extreme conditions during long-term training, ultra-long multi day races, and even an Ironman triathlon. Findings that helped me not to give up and move forward during the hardest days are of particular interest. That is why, along with the outer techniques and tips that are constantly updated, I love to use ancient mantras, meditation and prayer. Constant support of the inner will and help for the outer body have proved to be a very efficient combination! We have to believe in a higher Power.Only by believing in a higher PowerCan we go beyond and beyondOur limited, human capacity.[Sri Chinmoy, Sport and meditation]
I am not only a coach, but I am also an active athlete. I continue to take part in the world’s longest foot race of 3,100-Miles. There are 9 finishes in this race to my credit up to date with a personal best of 48 days + 3:57:19 (2014). In order to achieve that, I had to average 64.4 miles/103 km per day. 

Personal Bests

2 miles - 10:46
Marathon 26.2 miles - 2:46:04
47 miles - 6:18:25
Ironman Triathlon - 11:10:50
6 day race - 325 miles
3100-Mile Race - 48 days + 3:57:19 (64.4 miles/day)

Overall, I have over 30 years of experience in running.
You can get acquainted with me closer at my website www.Stutisheel.org
Books

I feel lucky to some extent - besides performing, I also like to share my love of running through books, motivational speeches, and inspiring communications. I get utmost happiness in seeing other people succeed, because I myself know the hard work it takes to transcend one's limits. So far I have four books to my credit:
Eat To Run: holistic nutrition for the ultra-marathon runner.Run Journey Become: the 3100-Mile footrace of a life-time.
My first Ironman: from dream to finish.
Esoteric Project Management. Holistic life-management based on spiritual practice and meditation. (Lots of exercises )You can look inside my books at Amazon. Here I'm offering them discounted in .pdf format.
The first time I seriously thought about professional coaching was the last year, when I trained my daughter from zero running experience to her first marathon, all in 7 months. I believe in her, and she believes in me - this way we continue our trainings to this day.
With a personal trainer there is no need to repeat past mistakes that leaves one with injuries or despair. We will leave only those that will help to make the fastest progress :)

Using my experience, it will be much much easier for you to create a holistic picture from the vast sea of available ​​information on preparation for the ultra-long races. 
And one more thing: the longer the distance, the less experts there are to guide you properly. As for the longest race in the world - 3100-Mile Race - there are only 38 people who have crossed the finish line in 19 years of the competition...

Fields of training
The greater the distance you aim for, the more unique experience I have to help you. The more serious your attitude towards training is, the more effective our work will be. On average, an athlete needs a few years, or even five, to reach the best performance in any given distance.
I can help you train for your personal best performance in races from a marathon to 3100-Miles, and everything in between. Also, half-Ironman and Ironman triathlons are something I am personally very familiar with, along with any other races that require extraordinary training.

Prices and conditions
You can find basic service options to the right of the campaign page.  All prices offered during this campaign are promotional and are valid while the campaign is active only. That is, only now you have the opportunity to purchase services even up to the August 2017 with a discount!
After your application, I will ask you to fill in a short questionnaire to better understand where the starting point for us is. And after the online interview, we will finalise our agreement. If, for some reason, during the interview you or I will see that the cooperation is not working out, I will gladly refund the paid amount back to you. Otherwise, I do not offer refunds past that point.



For our work to be efficient, you will require a GPS-enabled watch (preferably Garmin) with a heart rate monitor, and account in a training tracking system (eg. www.connect.garmin.com).

<h3>Intro</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We live in a time of viral outbreaks. Distance is something that has been shortened between people through technology, but somehow the majority is still very far from enjoying a good health, and for them accessing a healthcare system  is something that is not even a possibility.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469556947/Madela_cuumxv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>Millions of lives can be saved by giving them and their healthcare professionals tools to connect and receive backup. An immediate effect doing this is treatments applied at the right time.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The outbreak of Ebola in 2008 showed us how fast and easy a disease can spread when professionals and patients don´t receive support.</p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">BeeGeo is the system that allows a healthcare professional to gather information about a case and create a geographic alert. </span></p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>So how does BeeGeo works?</h3>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">When an alert is created other professionals and healthcare organizations are immediately notified, and they can see the information on the case and get in contact with the professional in order to start the help.</span><br/>
</div>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">A new form of preventive health is created. </span><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p>
<p>That
fresh information is going to be gathered, and understandable reports are going
to be issued for the general population. This gives everyone the chance of knowing what
is going on.</p>
<p><b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">You are going to be able to protect your beloved ones.</span><br/></b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">More complete
reports are going to be issued for other
professionals and organizations so they can be alert and understand what they
can face in the future.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>What does ¨This works for any type of case?¨ means?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Literally that all healthcare issues can be addressed.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>

<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Bees are one of the most advanced social animals. The way they communicate their findings is impressive. They work together and care about each other, they protect their environment and in the process help the rest of living organisms.</span><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Healthcare systems should work in a lot of ways like them.</p>
<p>The world of healthcare is composed by different types of entities and t<span style=""background-color: initial;"">he way they interact between each other is complex, but there are basic things that need to flow smoothly for all of them in order to reach real solutions.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The nectar of health is information and access to that information is one of the biggest problems we have.</p>

</div><div><br/></div><div>All users need access to certain parts of other users information without invading each others privacy.</div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b>
Patients need to keep track and ownership of their health record because it is their information!</b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b>Healthcare professionals, institutions and organizations need access to patients information to advance in the right direction.</b></div><div><br/></div><div>This and more is what BeeMedics is focused on.</div><div><br/></div>
<p>The planet provides us with a number of challenges and opportunities. The first level of interaction between the planet and our species is people in general and their healthcare professionals.</p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">
</span></p><p>They have to collect and study that information and
communicate it to the rest of the entities to receive the best support. </p>

One of the principles that make bees so successful in what they do is the ability receiving backup.<br/><p></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">All the entities involved in healthcare need backup and need to work together.</span><br/></p> <div> <h3>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">What we need</span><span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;""> </span><br/>

<p>The 50 k that we are going to get from all our supporters are essential, with that we are going to finish and launch BeeGeo.</p>
<p>If we exceed our 50 k goal let us tell you where is it going to go.<br/></p>
<p>BeeGeo is one key element in a big system named BeeMedics that is about making your health yours.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">BeeMedics is the comprehensive system that wants everyone to have access to the best healthcare system. With this patients will access great professionals and institutions that want to help them.</span></p>

<p>We believe that your health information is yours and you should be the one who manages it. </p>
<p>We also believe healthcare professionals need a platform to work on. A place where they can keep record of and access a lot more information so they can own their practice and give you the best service.</p>
<p>Finally we know that healthcare organizations and commerce need part of all that information in order to be able to make important advancements.</p>
<p>So we designed a system where every user needs are met without invading the privacy of other users, and where they own and manage their information</p>
<p><b>The needs of every patient, professional and healthcare organization satisfied.</b></p>
<p><b> So don´t worry if we overpass the goal because we will develop more parts of BeeMedics.</b><br/></p>

</div></div>","Intro


We live in a time of viral outbreaks. Distance is something that has been shortened between people through technology, but somehow the majority is still very far from enjoying a good health, and for them accessing a healthcare system  is something that is not even a possibility.



Millions of lives can be saved by giving them and their healthcare professionals tools to connect and receive backup. An immediate effect doing this is treatments applied at the right time.
The outbreak of Ebola in 2008 showed us how fast and easy a disease can spread when professionals and patients don´t receive support.

BeeGeo is the system that allows a healthcare professional to gather information about a case and create a geographic alert. 


So how does BeeGeo works?

When an alert is created other professionals and healthcare organizations are immediately notified, and they can see the information on the case and get in contact with the professional in order to start the help.

A new form of preventive health is created. 


That
fresh information is going to be gathered, and understandable reports are going
to be issued for the general population. This gives everyone the chance of knowing what
is going on.
You are going to be able to protect your beloved ones.


More complete
reports are going to be issued for other
professionals and organizations so they can be alert and understand what they
can face in the future.
What does ¨This works for any type of case?¨ means?
Literally that all healthcare issues can be addressed.



And since health is a human right BeeGeo is free for all users!


Why Bee?

Bees are one of the most advanced social animals. The way they communicate their findings is impressive. They work together and care about each other, they protect their environment and in the process help the rest of living organisms.


Healthcare systems should work in a lot of ways like them.
The world of healthcare is composed by different types of entities and the way they interact between each other is complex, but there are basic things that need to flow smoothly for all of them in order to reach real solutions.

The nectar of health is information and access to that information is one of the biggest problems we have.


All users need access to certain parts of other users information without invading each others privacy.
Patients need to keep track and ownership of their health record because it is their information!Healthcare professionals, institutions and organizations need access to patients information to advance in the right direction.This and more is what BeeMedics is focused on.
The planet provides us with a number of challenges and opportunities. The first level of interaction between the planet and our species is people in general and their healthcare professionals.
They have to collect and study that information and
communicate it to the rest of the entities to receive the best support. 

One of the principles that make bees so successful in what they do is the ability receiving backup.All the entities involved in healthcare need backup and need to work together.  
What we need 


The 50 k that we are going to get from all our supporters are essential, with that we are going to finish and launch BeeGeo.
If we exceed our 50 k goal let us tell you where is it going to go.
BeeGeo is one key element in a big system named BeeMedics that is about making your health yours.
BeeMedics is the comprehensive system that wants everyone to have access to the best healthcare system. With this patients will access great professionals and institutions that want to help them.

We believe that your health information is yours and you should be the one who manages it. 
We also believe healthcare professionals need a platform to work on. A place where they can keep record of and access a lot more information so they can own their practice and give you the best service.
Finally we know that healthcare organizations and commerce need part of all that information in order to be able to make important advancements.
So we designed a system where every user needs are met without invading the privacy of other users, and where they own and manage their information
The needs of every patient, professional and healthcare organization satisfied.
 So don´t worry if we overpass the goal because we will develop more parts of BeeMedics.
  

Impact and legacyOur legacy is to give everyone the chance of being well treated by healthcare professionals that are backed up by a wise healthcare community.We want everyone to be able to access a good healthcare system. It is all about making people´s lives better. 
Risks and Challenges

One of the most important elements in a healthcare treatment is time.  Time translate into lives, the implicit risk is not to create BeeGeo.



Many will say that our biggest challenge is to keep up to be the most comprehensive system, but we don´t worry about that. We are guided by our user needs and we are faithful to them. This is the cornerstone of our system and we know that if we count with the support of our users.
The loyalty we want from you is won by your complete satisfaction with the system.
We will always respect and enforce your privacy in our system.
This is health as it should be!


Rewards
BeeGeo is about giving everyone a chance to be a part of the best healthcare system. 
The first reward is knowing that you are saving millions of lives, but getting gifts is really cool and we will love to see you using our products; therefore, we have designed some gifts for you:
BeeGeo T-shirts





BeeGeo Documentary Film
The creation of a documentary film from the first day has never been made with a global healthcare technology initiative, so some time ago we received an offer of making a movie that documents the whole process. We created a partnership with a great film studio that is going to make it possible.
Filming the process and the results of BeeGeo in people´s lives is going to be amazing.
From the $50  to the $1000 reward you are going to be involved in this.Bee part of it!By the way if you have any ideas or want to be part of this you know where to find us!

<h3>De Ademrevolutie</h3>
<p>Als adem- en stemtherapeut stelt Carry al 41 jaar het belang vast van de buikadem tijdens het spreken. Het is de sleutel tot rust, ontspanning en balans. Oorspronkelijk bij de geboorte komen onze geluiden uit de buik en als peuter en kleuter brabbelen we onze eerste woordjes met een buikadem. Helaas verdwijnt die gezonde gewoonte al op jonge leeftijd door stress. En dat zorgt voor allerlei problemen op latere leeftijd. </p>
<p>Het is onze missie om ervoor te zorgen dat werkelijk iedereen de correcte buikadem opnieuw toepast tijdens het spreken. Carry creëerde een eenvoudige methode die je snel en makkelijk laat begrijpen hoe je dat doet. En het goede nieuws is: iedereen kan het opnieuw leren! Simpelweg omdat we het ooit allemaal hebben gekund en we het gelukkig nooit 100 procent zijn verleerd. </p>
<p>En liefst van al willen we voorkomen dat kinderen hun buikadem afleren. Eenvoudige instructies over ademen kunnen volstaan om hen te laten opgroeien met het besef hoe spreken natuurlijk werkt, bijvoorbeeld door te zeggen dat hun buikje moet bewegen als ze lezen en spreken en niet hun borst en hun schouders. En dat ze nooit naar adem moeten happen. We geloven dat als ze opgroeien met die inzichten, we veel ellende kunnen voorkomen. En dat goed ademen hen veel positiefs biedt. </p>
<p>Daarom hebben we dit boek samen geschreven. Ook Pascale Naessens, Michael Van Peel, Tom De Cock, Katelijne Boon, Alex Agnew, Natalia Druyts, Matteo Simoni, Pieterjan Desmedt, An Vanderstighelen, Nele Somers en Greet Wouters werkten aan dit boek mee door hun ervaring te delen. Hun getuigenissen vind je terug in het boek.</p>
<p>Hopelijk wordt het boek een grote aanwinst voor jou en mag het overal met je meereizen. Eerst in je rugzak en dan verinnerlijkt, in de vorm van een hoger levenscomfort. </p>

<h3>Wat hebben we nodig?</h3>
<p>We hebben het geluk gehad om een uitgever te vinden die het boek voor ons publiceert. Dus … waar hebben we jouw hulp dan nog voor nodig? </p>
<p>Wel, het zijn moeilijke tijden om een boek uit te brengen. Een voorwaarde van de uitgever om ons boek te publiceren was dat we zèlf de eerste 300 exemplaren zouden aankopen. Dit is een smak geld! Daarom vragen we je hulp om deze 300 boeken te financieren door een exemplaar via deze crowdfunding te kopen. We maken hier zelf geen winst op. Het verzamelde bedrag gaat integraal naar de aankoop van de boeken</p>
<p>En wat als we te veel inzamelen? Heel simpel: dat geld gaan we gebruiken om in scholen workshops en/of lezingen te geven over correct adem- en stemgebruik. Zo zijn we nòg een stapje dichter bij ons doel!</p>
<p>En als we ons doel niet halen, stort Indiegogo het verzamelde bedrag naar ons door. Daarmee kunnen we dan al een deel van de 300 boeken financieren. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Wat krijg je in ruil?</h3>
<p>Door het boek via de crowdfunding te kopen doe je een mooi voordeel: je koopt het boek aan met een grote korting. In de winkel betaal je €22.99, via de crowdfunding €18. </p>
<p>Kies hiernaast je opties: met of zonder verzending. Heb je wat meer te geef? Doe dan een steunbijdrage.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Ik heb geen budget, hoe kan ik toch helpen? </h3>
<p>Je kan ons heel erg helpen door deze crowdfunding campagne te delen met je vrienden. </p>
<h3>Ik heb het boek al, hoe kan ik toch helpen?</h3>
<p>Als je het boek al hebt, kan je een steunbijdrage doen. </p>
<h3>Vertel me meer over de Ademrevolutie!</h3>
<p>Met ons boek De Ademrevolutie willen we een belangrijke missing link in het ademverhaal naar buiten brengen. </p>
<p>In deze stressvolle tijden ademt haast niemand nog met de buik. Het besef is wel gegroeid dat de buikadem de sleutel is tot rust, ontspanning en balans. Dus gaan we er massaal naar op zoek in yoga, mindfulness, kinesitherapie en meditatie. Maar één ding zien we over het hoofd: tijdens al deze trainingen spréken we niet. En ademen is ook spreken. De lage adem die we hebben in de yoga, dus als we niet praten, zet zich helaas niet automatisch over in een buikadem tijdens het spreken. Om die te behouden, moeten we hem laten samenwerken met onze stembanden en spreekspieren, en dat is ons lichaam verleerd. Het resultaat van yoga beklijft dus niet in het dagelijkse leven.</p>
<p>Baby’s, peuters en kleuters praten en ademen nog op een natuurlijke manier. Maar ze verleren dat door stress, bijvoorbeeld terwijl ze leren lezen en rekenen. De omgeving merkt daar niets van, omdat ze er niet mee bezig is en er niets van af weet. Niemand stuurt het kind bij, waardoor het fout ademen er ongemerkt inslijpt en een gewoonte wordt. Zo gaan op den duur de meeste mensen door het leven met een hoge stressadem terwijl ze praten. Op die manier blijven ze in hun lichaam stress ervaren. </p>
<p>In De Ademrevolutie leggen we uit waarom de buikadem tijdens het spreken verdwijnt en leren we je aan de hand van heldere oefeningen, illustraties en inspirerende getuigenissen hoe je de lage adem altíjd kunt behouden. Zo verbetert je stem, verhoogt je zelfvertrouwen en vermindert je stress. Kortom, de buikadem verhoogt je levenscomfort.</p>

<h2 align=""center""> </h2>
<h2 align=""center""><strong>BUDGET</strong></h2>
<p>As we work hard to stick to our high standard of quality throughout this 23-episode production, our budget is only going to keep increasing.

<h2 align=""center""><strong>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</strong></h2>
<p>In spite of huge leaps forward in the prevention, treatment, and curing of multiple life-threatening diseases over the last century, there are still many diseases for which there are no cures and only minimal treatment options. On top of that, dangerous chemicals are regularly injected into our environment and our food chain, leading to a possible genetic aberrations in our world communities. As a consequence, identifying and preventing disease have become tasks more daunting than ever before. We have made it our mission to raise awareness of this new generation of super-diseases and to educate people on the ever-changing health risks for which pollution is responsible.</p>
<p>Our film production, spread out across several continents and involving hundreds of experts, presents a large and unique challenge, a fact of which we are all aware. We are equipped with advanced motion picture support systems and partnerships with leading specialists and well-prepared to take on all changes associated with executing this project well. Our production schedule is designed to accommodate any and all uncertainties.</p>
<p>We are intent on producing a world-class film series about authentic yoga, and we will work hard to keep our promises and deliver all 23 episodes of this series according to the timeline we have laid out.</p>

BUDGET
As we work hard to stick to our high standard of quality throughout this 23-episode production, our budget is only going to keep increasing. We plan on visiting hundreds of shoot locations throughout the Indian subcontinent, Europe, and America in addition to conducting dozens of interviews with medical professionals, scientists, and yoga scholars from around the world. We need to cover the costs of travel, legal work, permits, accounting, insurance, and more.
For help raising $100,000 of our budget, we are crowdfunding through Indiegogo. Given the positive impact that this series will have on the health of millions of people worldwide, we believe backers support us generously.
For post-production, marketing, and distribution, we may need to hold a second round of funding, but for now $100,000 should get the job done. As we work to raise these funds, we must express our deepest gratitude to you, our dear supporters, for the generosity you show us. Without you, this project would not be possible. The harder we work together, the better we can make this series. Every contribution brings us a little bit closer to our end goal.

RISKS AND CHALLENGES
In spite of huge leaps forward in the prevention, treatment, and curing of multiple life-threatening diseases over the last century, there are still many diseases for which there are no cures and only minimal treatment options. On top of that, dangerous chemicals are regularly injected into our environment and our food chain, leading to a possible genetic aberrations in our world communities. As a consequence, identifying and preventing disease have become tasks more daunting than ever before. We have made it our mission to raise awareness of this new generation of super-diseases and to educate people on the ever-changing health risks for which pollution is responsible.
Our film production, spread out across several continents and involving hundreds of experts, presents a large and unique challenge, a fact of which we are all aware. We are equipped with advanced motion picture support systems and partnerships with leading specialists and well-prepared to take on all changes associated with executing this project well. Our production schedule is designed to accommodate any and all uncertainties.
We are intent on producing a world-class film series about authentic yoga, and we will work hard to keep our promises and deliver all 23 episodes of this series according to the timeline we have laid out.

Up to 90% of common press and breathe, metered-dose inhaler (MDI) users fail to get the intended benefits from their medications due to inhaler misuse. And up to 85% of healthcare providers can't properly demonstrate or omit critical steps when using MDIs.                        MDI misuse is common among both asthma & COPD sufferers and healthcare providers.  The fact is, it hasn't improved over the past 40 years.So, does it really matter? Consider this, if you put gasoline in the back seat of your car, does it work as well as if you put gasoline into the gas tank?  Of course not. So, it's a similar problem facing the +50 million people in the U.S. who suffer from asthma and COPD who rely upon inhalers to breathe. When it comes to getting medications from inhalers into their lungs, the majority of people with asthma and COPD just get by on fumes.Aren't There Already Devices to Help Inhaler Users?Yep, they're termed ""Spacers"". Spacers are add-on devices to MDIs. They trap large medication particles generated from MDIs that would otherwise deposit in the mouth. There are a variety of rigid, ""tube type"" Spacers on the market. To name a few brands: Aerochamber, Vortex, Optichamber, modified Coke bottles, etc..                                                        Affectionately, the FDA  refers to rigid, tube type Spacer devices as ""essentially hollow tubes"". The InspirEase®HFA​ is NOT a rigid, hollow, tube type Spacer.A common problem with tube type Spacers is that you can't really tell when you have fully and effectively inhaled each puff into your lungs. Some people suggest that you might as well just use an empty toilet paper tube.                                                                 It seems that many people just can't tell the difference between using an inhaler with a tube type Spacer or without. It's one of the reasons why up to 87% of patients fail to use tube type Spacers regularly. 
InspirEase®HFA​ Solution (""iHFA®"")
                 This device is investigational and not currently available for commercial sale.By design, the iHFA solves the most common problems and concerns that people have using MDIs and tube type Spacers.Simple and Easy to UseSimply attach a press and breathe MDI to the InspirEaseHFA, open the device, trigger the inhaler, and breathe in.        No more wondering if you actually get the full puff from an inhaler into your lungs.
See the bag collapse as you inhale the full puff.
If you hear a whistle, you breathed in too fast for effective delivery of the medication into your lungs.  
                 See the bag collapse? Don't hear a sound? Rest assured, you have gotten the full puff of medication from your inhaler.
​Compact SizeThe InspirEase®HFA is more compact than most tube type Spacers.  It fits in the palm of your hand. The diameter of the collapsible bag is less than half the size of a standard toothbrush. The thickness is about the same size as a MDI that you would use in the iHFA®. The iHFA comes with a carry pouch.What We Need & What You GetSo, unlike your favorite kitchen appliance, the InspirEase®HFA is a Class 2 regulated medical device and requires approval by the FDA prior to marketing and sales.  We need to raise funds, to move us along the path towards FDA approval.  What do we need the funds for?
To finalize our assembly and manufacturing processes
Perform lab testing required for our 510K FDA approval
To file a formal  510k FDA submission with the FDA
And did we mention? Lawyers.
What do you get?
After FDA approval, for a single contribution of $100 or more, you will entitled to receive 3 FREE InspirEase®HFA devices (prescription required).

You can buy 1 bottle at $25.00, 2 bottles for $50.00 or 3 bottles for $75.00.  If you are a male or don't experience issues with your vaginal health, give a bottle to a friend or loved one to improve their vaginal health and overall confidence!</li>
<li>If the $6,000 goal is not reached, contributions will still be used to bring pHembiotics to fruition however, it will delay the launch date as we explore other avenues of funding.</li>

<li><p>pHembiotics will also donate 10% of our profits to the Pastoralist Child Foundation, a non-profit organization that works to end Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) in Kenya.

<p><br/>Dentoville Foundation is a Non-Profit Humanitarian organization founded in 2018 with a view to improve and cater for free oral health care for orphans, children and adults in rural areas. Almost all of the adults and children in rural populations in Nigeria have absolutely no dental care. There is no doubt that there is urgent need for dental care in many of these areas. Most of this people cannot afford neither have they been enlightened about their oral health care. This does not exclude the Orphans. Our Vision is to bring quality oral health care to these completely ignored underdeveloped areas, and to make significant difference in the lives of so many people, to see them smile with happiness in their hearts. Helping others is where we find hope.</p>
<p>Dentoville Foundation was formed with a philosophy in mind: offering quality oral healthcare to the less privileged. Continued improvement and innovative ideas is our policy as this will ensure progress for many years to come. We intend to focus on one simple strategy: Giving the best basic oral healthcare service possible.</p>
<p>The organization thus arranges a number of projects in rural areas and orphanage homes. We send out a substantial number of Volunteers, Dentists, Dental Hygienist, Dental assistants and health workers. It is of the utmost importance that our projects build on local partnerships with communities that know the local conditions and specific needs of the area. We arrange our activities in accordance with the values, rules and regulations of the communities we visit, this way we can ensure that our aid will reach the right target group. Dentoville Foundation’s projects are financed by members, sponsors and private donations</p>
<p>Our goal is to provide free dental care to the orphans, less privileged and those in rural areas. To give free basic oral health treatment to those who have no access to it. We are here to:</p>
<p><br/>•    Provide dental care to as many needy orphans who lack good basic oral hygiene and dental care.</p>
<p>•    Create educational or prevention programs in rural areas.</p>
<p>•    Distribution of dental supplies such as toothbrushes and tooth paste at the villages and rural communities.</p>
<p>•    Reduce low self-esteem in rural areas associated with bad oral health.</p>
<p>Our Teams will travel to orphanage homes and remote villages with the aim of providing free dental care to the communities. </p>
<p>Majority of these orphans do not have access to a dentist and even  if dentists were easy to access in these areas, money is also an issue. A majority of them don’t have enough money to pay for food let alone to get dental care. And it may even cost more than what they would consider worth paying when they would rather spend what little money they have on more important things like food. In the more rural areas, like the ones we serve, there is approximately 1 dental professional for every 100,000 to 300,000 people. So even if they had the money, access, or the resources to reach any dental care, they may not receive quality care because the dental worker is over worked or always too busy.</p>

<strong>Genomes.io</strong> is building a DNA data bank that puts users in full control of their genomic data. By addressing privacy, security and ownership concerns of DNA testing and data sharing, we aim to secure the future of personalised medicine.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>
<strong>How do we do it?</strong> We provide you with a DNA test kit to securely sequence your whole genome, and the resulting data is uploaded into to your personal DNA vault. This is a secure encrypted virtual data storage environment, which you can control access to using our mobile app. Using your web account, you can run genetic reports on your data and view results. In summary, <strong>each</strong> whole genome sequencing kit ordered will need to be activated by <strong>one</strong> user web account and connected to <strong>one </strong>mobile app. </li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>

<strong>Why we need your support?</strong> With your support, we aim to recruit the Founding Users onto the platform and quickly grow our DNA bank to critical mass to begin working with research organisations.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>
<strong>In addition,</strong> we will use campaign funds to further build out the platform to include more genetic reports (in addition to Carrier Status which is already built) including Ancestry, Health Risks, Drug Response and Personal Traits by 2021. Rewards that include Lifetime Reports will give you a free lifetime subscription to these reports, and all future reports, as they become available on the platform.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>
<strong>Our DNA sequencing labs? </strong>We work with CAP and CLIA-compliant partner laboratories to provide our customers with 30x whole genome sequencing, which all comply with our end-to-end privacy-preserving workflows.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>

Genomes.io is building a DNA data bank that puts users in full control of their genomic data. By addressing privacy, security and ownership concerns of DNA testing and data sharing, we aim to secure the future of personalised medicine. 
How do we do it? We provide you with a DNA test kit to securely sequence your whole genome, and the resulting data is uploaded into to your personal DNA vault. This is a secure encrypted virtual data storage environment, which you can control access to using our mobile app. Using your web account, you can run genetic reports on your data and view results. In summary, each whole genome sequencing kit ordered will need to be activated by one user web account and connected to one mobile app.  
Who are we? We are a small team based in London, UK. Over the past two years we have built a fully functioning prototype and we are now ready to welcome the first users to the platform. Our DNA test kits are ready to ship. 
Why we need your support? With your support, we aim to recruit the Founding Users onto the platform and quickly grow our DNA bank to critical mass to begin working with research organisations. 
In addition, we will use campaign funds to further build out the platform to include more genetic reports (in addition to Carrier Status which is already built) including Ancestry, Health Risks, Drug Response and Personal Traits by 2021. Rewards that include Lifetime Reports will give you a free lifetime subscription to these reports, and all future reports, as they become available on the platform. 
Our DNA sequencing labs? We work with CAP and CLIA-compliant partner laboratories to provide our customers with 30x whole genome sequencing, which all comply with our end-to-end privacy-preserving workflows. 
What you see is what you get. All screenshots of the website and mobile application used in our video and throughout our Indiegogo page are actual footage of the functional platform, so we are ready to open the doors to our Founding Users.  Our StoryWe are on the brink of potentially the biggest change in health and wellbeing that the world has ever seen.  In recent years there has been an extraordinary leap in understanding of the human genome, and it’s complex yet powerful role in health and disease. In 2003, the first human genome was sequenced. The project took 13 years of vast collaboration between international research institutions and cost over $1 billion. But due to the technological advance of next-generation DNA sequencing technologies, this is now available for under $1,000. Today, we sit at the genesis of the genomics age.  By just 2025, 15% of the world’s population will have had their genome sequenced. Population-scale DNA sequencing projects are being established around the globe as healthcare systems are increasingly understanding the benefits of having access to this data. And in our lifetime, it is highly likely that everyone will have the opportunity to get their genome sequenced, as we look towards a future where healthcare is tailored specifically to you.  What is my genome?Your genome is a unique 3 billion letter code present in every cell in your body, which serves as the biological blueprint that makes you - you. It is the most comprehensive piece of health data you will ever have, and it is powerful.  But we are just at the tip of the iceberg.Billions of dollars are spent each year on understanding what the missing regions of DNA mean, and everyday new phenotype-genotype correlations are established and findings are published.Because of the gold-mine of information genomic data holds, researchers are desperate to harness the power of this data to drive lifesaving medical research and accelerate bringing new treatments to those that need them most. Researchers desperately need access to your DNA data to enable:

Patient population stratification: Identifying and stratifying patient populations based on risk of disease progression.

Clinical trial optimisation: Analysis of genomic data enabling enhanced feasibility studies to inform key decision parameters for clinical trial development.

Biomarker development: Discovery of novel drug candidates through analysis of genetic biomarkers associated with disease phenotypes.

Companion diagnostic development: Development of companion diagnostics to determine which patient should receive what medication at what dose.

Drug repurposing and repositioning: Generating evidence to support applications of combination therapies with new or existing drugs. 
  Making this data available to researchers is therefore paramount to usher in a new era of personalised medicine. But sharing genomic data needs to be done responsibly - and that is what we do best. Your genome is the most valuable piece of personal information you will ever have.You only have one. And unlike your credit card details, passport numbers or home address, it cannot be changed. But currently, as soon as you have your DNA tested you lose all control of your data. And as genetic testing becomes more and more routine, and the more information we can decipher from a human genome, the known risks and currently unknown risks of sharing this data in the current model exponentially increase.  Below are a few examples of how your DNA data has been treated over the last decade. And things are set to get a lot worse.  DNA databases are amassed, owned and controlled by organisations in order to share with third parties in multimillion dollar deals, and are increasingly liable to data hacks and breaches. The Problem  In the current model, personal genomics companies profit not only by selling you a DNA kit and genetic reports, but by selling access to your data to third parties such as big pharma and biotech. You don’t own your DNA or have any say in who gets access to it. Our Solution  With Genomes.io, you can reap the benefits of getting your whole genome sequenced, while never losing ownership or control of your most personal piece of information.

The change in angle allows you to target different muscles with an effortless transition. Just pick a muscle and angle Posturenomic accordingly. Hold the stretch as needed.For tips and various stretches, please refer to our The Posturenomic Board Stretch Guide! Who It’s Designed For?The most common and debilitating body ailment is back pain. On average, we sit for 9 ½ - 10 hr/day which causes a great level of stress and strain to the hip stabilizer muscles.Unfortunately, Lower back pain is not getting the right attention it deserves and it is only on the rise. We want to prevent or reverse the effects that source lower back pain.Crowdfunding Campaign Mission Every contribution helps!

We are dedicating our time and effort in developing innovative tools while still being practical in order to help prevent chronic pain.  By backing this project, you are directly putting an end to poor posture, back pain, and stiffness all over the world.SittingWhat’s happening to YOUR body?At first, you’ll have tightness and stiffness of the muscles with some pain. It’s your body’s natural feedback mechanism that’s an alert for imbalances and muscle weakness. You won’t be going to your weekly pickup game or playing in the park with your children. Some will be bedridden because of the extensive pain. A couple days later the pain dulls and your back to your daily routines. At this point, you can act or forget about it which many of us do. The body adapts to maintain upright movement, this means the imbalanced muscles will realign the hip to maintain mobility but degrade posture. If you restrict the range of movements you will only be able to professionally sit. Running, jogging and even walking becomes harder because of ineffective hip muscles.If you have lower back pain you’re not alone. Most people in their lifetime experience one or more episodes of lower back pain. In most cases, the pain goes away within days or weeks however it can last for three months or more. It’s estimated that 1/3rd population has these extended episodes which are defined as Chronic lower back pain.How Can the

Regaining mobility in the hip and realigning it through the use of the Posturenomic Board will alleviate the compression caused by the chronic sitting reducing lower back pain.The three different angles help in a progressive stretch routine that way you’ll increase your range of motion and get back to your daily routine pain-free.What Does It Treat?Common Pain Reduction:

Why? Because you don't know you are doing it, it happens unconsciously. Untreated, bruxism causes all kinds of expensive dental bills and pain. Unfortunately, the dentist only has a couple options... prescribe a dental splint / mouth guard that costs anywhere from $400 to $800 OR the dentist must perform cost surgeries such as replacing damaged teeth, overlays and crowns... costing $1000's...  Even then the bruxism behavior continues and jaw pain, neck pain, frequent headaches, migraines and TMJ (temporomandibular joint) disorder can occur, not too mention you will most likely be back in the dentist's office again for more treatments / surgeries because your bruxism never stopped.Until now, bruxism sufferers had no easy way to detect bruxism early, detect it before damage occurs... Until now, bruxism sufferers had no affordable way to treat and eliminate their stress and bruxism disorder. With BruxRelief, NOW YOU do!What is Bruxism? How does Stress play a part?

 
BruxRelief Detection & Biofeedback TherapyWhat if you found a solution? One wearable smart device that could detect if you have bruxism early and you can use the same device to treat and eliminate stress and bruxism disorder using biofeedback therapy. Easy to Use Incredibly Small One Connected Wearable DeviceWhat is Biofeedback Therapy?Biofeedback Therapy has been clinically tested for more than 25 years to end damaging and debilitating behaviors like Bruxism. Studies have repeatedly demonstrated that biofeedback therapy can successful aid an adult to retrain their brain and stop an unwanted behavior. In the last few years especially, specific studies have been conducted with patients suffering from Bruxism and biofeedback therapy and once again proved to be the solution these patients were looking for to end their bruxism. Now we've made this therapy available for all. BruxRelief is affordable, incredibly convenient, and provides comprehensive therapy by helping you to reduce your stress levels during the day and stop unwanted / harmful behaviours of clenching and grinding during your sleep.Dr. Oxana Balan - Co-Founder BruxReliefUp until now, dentist and bruxism sufferers have had no reliable way to detect bruxism disorder and treat it before damage occurs. Using biofeedback therapy dentist and bruxism sufferers can retrain their brain to destress and stop teeth clenching and teeth grinding behavior.BruxRelief allows users to destress their life during the day and stop their teeth grinding and clenching while they sleep all in one device at an affordable price.The ScienceBiofeedback is like a superpower, it's like Spider-Man's 'Spidersense'. It allows your subconscious to be more aware so you can sense an unwanted behavior and change it. Biofeedback therapy is a technique that provides individuals with information about their bodily functions with the intention of promoting changes in behavior that result in improved health. Electronically detected physiological measurements are coupled with a feed-back signal that is initiated when pre-specified conditions are met. The BruxRelief device aims to generate a learned response that persists even after the therapy is discontinued as proven with other Biofeedback clinical and therapy results.Insight Into The GrindDeveloped with user friendly visuals and settings, the BruxRelief app helps you record your stress, clenching and teeth grinding occurrences, track progress, and customize settings such as vibration and audio signals. The app combines with BruxRelief to bring to the user a fully customizable therapy solution to address your stress, clenching and teeth grinding.  Put your BruxRelief on, set the app and sweet dreams How It Works The BruxRelief will attach behind your ear using a medical grade reusable adhesive gel. The device uses our patent pending sensor technology to measure muscle activity when you are clenching or grinding your teeth. Once the device senses clenching or grinding during stressful events or sleep, the device will emit a signal to your subconscious to stop the behavior without disturbing your workday or your sleep.BruxRelief placementThe device will also communicate via bluetooth with your smartphone and the free BruxRelief app. You can use the app to customize your therapy and track your progress. There is also and online web portal you can use to share your therapy and progress with your dentist.TimelineIndiegogo launchIndiegogo funded – 35daysFinalize design and source all materials for manufacturing – 90 daysBuild / manufacture - 60 daysPackaging/ship/delivery – 30 daysRewardsThe TeamBruxRelief Team Rockstart Launchtrack Demo Day PitchBruxRelief Advisors Prototyping & TestingWe've spent the last year testing out various prototypes and sensor configurations that have allowed us to come up with some huge breakthroughs in sensor technology.

possible.  The main soles of our flip-flops are made with our unique formulation of 100% polyurethane.  It’s the same material found in performance running and sports shoes and it ensures long-lasting cushion, rebound, bounce and durability.  It’s the secret ingredient that makes our flip-flops ultra-comfortable!  To hold the cold, Theraflops have freezing gel packs embedded in the heel.  They provide refreshing cold to the entire foot initially, while the heel portion delivers cold therapy for up to 30 minutes,  Our gel is nontoxic and environmentally friendly.  Theraflops are designed to withstand over a thousand pounds of pressure.  The result is a flip-flop that is best in its class: long lasting, super comfy, and made right here in America. </p><p><img class=""lazy""

from this condition where icing the heel is one treatment to alleviate pain and swelling in the foot.  Plantar fasciitis is the pain caused by degenerative irritation at the insertion of the plantar fascia on the medial process of the calcaneal tuberosity.  The pain may be substantial, resulting in the alteration of daily activities.  Also called jogger’s heel, tennis heel, and policeman’s heel.  The annual cost of treatments for plantar fasciitis is estimated to be between $192 - $376 million.</p><p>•<strong>Diabetic Nerve Pain in Feet - 29 Million </strong>Americans have diabetes</p><p>•<strong>Severs Disease​</strong> is a condition in active children age 6 to 13, where the heel bone stretches from the tendon and causes pain and discomfort. Cold therapy to the area is crucial to relieve the pain.  Severs disease is not actually a disease but a heel injury.  During a growth spurt, a child’s heel bone grows faster than the muscles, tendons, and ligaments.  When the muscles and tendons can’t grow fast enough to keep up, they are stretched too tight resulting in pain.  If a child is very active, it can put extra strain on already overstretched tendons.  This leads to swelling and pain at the point where the tendons attach to the growing part of the heel.  Most doctors estimate 1 in 3 active children suffer from Severs Disease.</p><p>•<strong>Sore &amp; Tired feet</strong> from activity attributed to:</p><p>•Endurance athletes including first-time marathoners, cyclists, and cross-fit enthusiasts</p><p>•Runners </p><p>•Footballers (American and Soccer), Baseball </p><p>•Hoops, volleyball, tennis</p><p>•Golf</p><p>•Dance and Cheer</p><p>•<strong>Jobs that keep us on our feet all day</strong> including hospital staff, military and police</p><p>•Retail</p><p>•Restaurant Staff</p><p>•Construction</p><p><strong>•Lifestyle</strong> - Cool relief from hot pavement and beaches</p><h3><strong>                                  Our TEAM</strong></h3><p>David Hinkle : Founder and inventor of Theraflops</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506910413/jckxxykrfid6f5rnva0m.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Doctor Bob Meyer : Chief therapy officer and treatment education specialist, consultant to University of Texas Athletics</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506897772/bwcqrddt6kc2fy9f5f6z.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Commander Mark McGinnis : US Navy SEAL and Chief Operator</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/235660999?portrait=0"" style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'></iframe></div><p></p><p>The Velvet Cartel: content</p><p>Joe Brophy: Counsel</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Design</strong></p><div> </div><div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506651705/gbbmszxkvztiixtik41k.png"" src=""""/></div><div>Theraflops original design displays gel pack placement</div><div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506889234/fiiyfpjwx5bg29ydctcs.png"" src=""""/></div><div>Gel pack that is embedded in the heel</div><h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">How Will We Use The Funds?</h3><div>

Cold therapy to the area is crucial to relieve the pain.  Severs disease is not actually a disease but a heel injury.  During a growth spurt, a child’s heel bone grows faster than the muscles, tendons, and ligaments.  When the muscles and tendons can’t grow fast enough to keep up, they are stretched too tight resulting in pain.  If a child is very active, it can put extra strain on already overstretched tendons.  This leads to swelling and pain at the point where the tendons attach to the growing part of the heel.  Most doctors estimate 1 in 3 active children suffer from Severs Disease.•Sore & Tired feet from activity attributed to:•Endurance athletes including first-time marathoners, cyclists, and cross-fit enthusiasts•Runners •Footballers (American and Soccer), Baseball •Hoops, volleyball, tennis•Golf•Dance and Cheer•Jobs that keep us on our feet all day including hospital staff, military and police•Retail•Restaurant Staff•Construction•Lifestyle - Cool relief from hot pavement and beaches                                  Our TEAMDavid Hinkle : Founder and inventor of TheraflopsDoctor Bob Meyer : Chief therapy officer and treatment education specialist, consultant to University of Texas AthleticsCommander Mark McGinnis : US Navy SEAL and Chief OperatorThe Velvet Cartel: contentJoe Brophy: CounselDesign Theraflops original design displays gel pack placementGel pack that is embedded in the heel How Will We Use The Funds?
We will be using these funds to manufacture our first production of Theraflops, including additional molds and components that the design needs across many sizes! The more money we raise, the more we can make for all of you! 
We will also be helping to create more jobs in America with all of the production and processing being done in Missouri and Texas, so thank you so much for helping this dream come true for us, and for everyone who will benefit from it!

<p><strong>Lyme disease sucks.</strong> Excuse my French, but it really does. I know this because I've been dealing with it—and its not-so-fun relations called ""co-infections"" who also jumped on the tick bandwagon—for over 5 years now. <i>Wait, my sister-in-law had Lyme </i><i>and she just took a few weeks of antibiotics <i>and is fine</i>. </i>Well, she's lucky. For many, it takes an average of 2 years to get diagnosed and by that time the infection has progressed to what is known as <a href=""https://www.lymedisease.org/lyme-basics/lyme-disease/chronic-lyme/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">chronic Lyme disease</a>, which is difficult and complicated to treat. Actually, there is no definitive cure! And, as my doctor is so cheerfully wont to say, ""Lyme disease doesn't kill you but it makes you wish you were dead."" In fact, the number one cause of death associated with Lyme disease is suicide. Major bummer.</p>
<p><strong>So let's save lives!</strong> I'm raising these funds for the creation of a website called ""Lyme Gets Better: Stories of Remission."" The aim of my web project is partly to prevent any more Lyme suicides, and partly to help people get well by providing evidence, information, and encouragement through an ongoing series of interviews with those who overcame Lyme<i>.</i> Because there ARE people who are in remission from chronic Lyme and who have their lives back. In fact, I've interviewed four such individuals! Each written interview I conduct will run on the website accompanied by a short video made by my interviewees that directly addresses the viewer to motivate them to keep going. (The videos will be especially salient to those who are unable to read due to Lyme's effects on basic cognitive abilities.) As I like to say, hope is medicine!</p>
<p><strong>Why this project is necessary. </strong>One story can save a life. I know this to be true from personal experience. When I was at my sickest, I scoured the Internet for stories of people who overcame this monstrous experience I was going through. But I found none. Only horror stories. At the time, I had just moved out of NYC, too sick to live my awesome life there, and moved back in with my parents. This was my low, I mean, I was<i> really low</i>. Then, a family friend put me in touch with a woman who had Lyme for 10 years and is now totally fine. We spoke on the phone and that one conversation kept me from giving up on myself and was the thread that pulled me through the coming arduous years of treatment. (<font>In fact, I've interviewed her for this project!) I wrote about our conversation for <a href=""https://www.buzzfeed.com/anasaldamando/what-its-like-when-no-one-believes-youre-sick?utm_term=.ekWKkkLwz#.dcbz776JX"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BuzzFeed</a>, if you want more deets on my personal story.</font></p>
<p><b>This could help, like, millions of people.</b> No joke. Some Lyme disease advocates place the number of infected in the United States at 1 to 2 million. And that's just in the US. This vector-borne nastiness can be found on every continent, sans Antartica. Yet, it has been largely a silent epidemic (don't get me started on how the government has turned a blind eye). Information is so badly needed, especially around what treatments work for people. And yes, treatments get people better but hope is what keeps people alive to keep trying them. ""Lyme Gets Better"" will provide both hope and information to the desperate millions who are wading through this quagmire of a disease. </p>
<p><strong>How You're Helping. </strong>Even though I live in the tech capital of the world (San Fran!), everyone who knows me knows that I'm not the most tech savvy person. I mean, I'm a writer! (This has been my sorry excuse. Oh, for more of my writing about Lyme, check it out in <i><a href=""http://www.elle.com/life-love/sex-relationships/a33272/why-i-tell-men-about-my-chronic-disease-on-the-first-date/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Elle</a> </i>and <i><a href=""https://catapult.co/stories/the-surf-cure"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Catapult</a>.</i>) Nevertheless, I feel very compelled by the Universe or what-have-you to build this website, which I'm going to do on SquareSpace.

<p><b>There is no other space on the Internet like the one I'm proposing to create.</b> As aforementioned, I spent a LOT of time googling for remission stories when I was really sick. To this day, I have yet to find a space on the websphere that is solely one of positivity and dedicated to stories of those who beat chronic Lyme.

So sadly, <strong>the demand for my web project will only grow</strong> and someone you know may be touched by Lyme, if they haven't already. </p>
<p>On a cheerier note, I'm happy to report that my own journey with Lyme disease is coming to a close. The conversations I've had with the very people whose interviews I want to run have aided my healing enormously. Please help us spread the word that ""Lyme Gets Better.""  </p>

</ul><h2 style=""font-weight: normal;color: #004472;font-size: 38px;text-align: center;margin:50px 0;"">Reason #1: The knowledge gap</h2><p style=""text-align: justify;text-indent: 20px;"">People are dying due to lack of knowledge. Health care workers in developing countries continue to lack access to basic information that enables them to deliver safe and effective care. This leads to patients being denied proper treatment, or sometimes even given unnecessary or harmful treatments, contributing to tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths</p><p style=""text-align: justify;text-indent: 20px;"">According to a report published in the Journal Human Resources for Health, a gross lack of knowledge about the basics on how to diagnose and manage common diseases is often associated with ineffective and dangerous health care practices. This indicates that modern medicine, even at a basic level, has largely failed much of the world's population.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;text-indent: 20px;"">Nowadays there are hundreds of clinical trials conducted each year, each reporting a potentially more effective treatment for the patient, it is simply unrealistic for a doctor to digest this much information and recall them accurately on demand when treating a patient.</p><div style=""margin:20px 0;padding:20px;background:#f3f3f3;"">
<h3 style=""text-align: center;font-size: 28px;font-weight: normal;"">Our solution</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;text-indent: 20px;"">We designed an oncological bot after analyzing thousands of diagnostic options, and with the help of programmers who developed it under the guidance of top oncologists from Israel and US.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;text-indent: 20px;"">The bot has a very simple and easy to use interface that can be used by people of all age groups and most importantly has no biases.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;text-indent: 20px;"">We plan to create a medical information ecosystem using the bots that will assist doctors in developing countries to better treat their patients.</p>

But to prevent diseases, we need doctors who can identify the diseases before the first symptoms and provide timely interventions.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;text-indent: 20px;"">According to the World Health Organization, the world is facing a shortage of 4.3 million health workers of which doctors make up a crucial part.</p><h3 align=""center"">Training this many doctors in a short period of time is short of impossible!</h3><div style=""margin:20px 0;padding:20px;background:#f3f3f3;"">

We are a young and dynamic international company with a team of highly qualified doctors, IT specialists, and medical research scientists working passionately together to disrupt the medical industry and provide affordable high-quality medical services in the developing world. We have developed a telemedicine platform and patent-pending bot consultation for detecting oncological diseases at early stages.For our next project, we plan to build 7 new intelligent bots in the areas of significant demand, namely cardiology, obstetrics and gynecology (woman’s health), psychiatry, men’s health, pediatrics (children health), infectious and tropical diseases, and nutrition and obesity (dietology) that will conduct primary consultations, detect disease at an early stage, and provide timely interventions to promote health and prevent diseases.It's important to us that YOU be a part of this large-scale project. Our backers will receive special passes in the mail for our Oncobot and video consultations with our doctors.You may also choose to give away medical consultations to our donation pool. They will be distributed through our partners – Red Cross and WDU (World Disability Union). Why do we need a bot revolution? Here are some of the most important problems with our healthcare system:
Inconsistency in knowledge of diagnosis and treatment by physicians
Shortage of skilled health professionals to reach 12.9 million in coming decades
767 million people in the world live under $1.90 a day and have no way to pay for their health care
Lack of access to health care centers leads to poor illness management
Reason #1: The knowledge gapPeople are dying due to lack of knowledge. Health care workers in developing countries continue to lack access to basic information that enables them to deliver safe and effective care. This leads to patients being denied proper treatment, or sometimes even given unnecessary or harmful treatments, contributing to tens of thousands of unnecessary deathsAccording to a report published in the Journal Human Resources for Health, a gross lack of knowledge about the basics on how to diagnose and manage common diseases is often associated with ineffective and dangerous health care practices. This indicates that modern medicine, even at a basic level, has largely failed much of the world's population.Nowadays there are hundreds of clinical trials conducted each year, each reporting a potentially more effective treatment for the patient, it is simply unrealistic for a doctor to digest this much information and recall them accurately on demand when treating a patient.
Our solution
We designed an oncological bot after analyzing thousands of diagnostic options, and with the help of programmers who developed it under the guidance of top oncologists from Israel and US.
The bot has a very simple and easy to use interface that can be used by people of all age groups and most importantly has no biases.
We plan to create a medical information ecosystem using the bots that will assist doctors in developing countries to better treat their patients.

Reason #2: Where are the doctors?Prevention is better than cure might be the most relevant proverb for the people living in the 21st century. But to prevent diseases, we need doctors who can identify the diseases before the first symptoms and provide timely interventions.According to the World Health Organization, the world is facing a shortage of 4.3 million health workers of which doctors make up a crucial part.Training this many doctors in a short period of time is short of impossible!
Our solution
This is where our bots excel. They can conduct hundreds of thousands of consultations in a day and the patients also have the choice of using the bot at their convenience.

Reason #3: Lack of accessEase of access to health care is of great importance in any country but particularly in developing countries, where restricted access can put people at risk of illnesses. People often have to walk, sometimes for days, to get to a decent clinic or hospital.
Our solution
We have designed an online virtual clinic on our platform so that anyone with an Internet-connected device living in any corner of Earth can easily access our platform and receive qualified medical help.
Reason #4: The cost of survival According to a WHO and World Bank Group report, there are 400 million people who do not have access to essential health services and 6% of people in low- and middle-income countries are tipped further into extreme poverty because of health spending.At least 80% of humanity lives on less than $10 a day. While a recent statistic shows an average consultation in developing countries varies anywhere from 1$-15$.People living in developing countries are unable to pay for consultations. This puts away most of them even visiting a doctor to seek professional help, and in the majority of the cases, people often come to see doctors when they are in the final stage of the disease.
Our solution
We are ready to build bots aimed at different specialties and tailored to developing countries and offer the primary consultation for FREE to over 1 million people.
Why do we need YOU?We firmly believe in the global reach of our project and we find crowdfunding to be the perfect platform to deliver our message and gain support.For this, we need to raise $120,000 to cover the costs of our doctors, programmers and data scientists in developing the bots. In exchange, we're offering you an Oncobot consultation for a discounted price, and a unique opportunity to be a part of the next Big Thing and help solve medical problems around the world.Risk of oncological diseases


Research and development$50,000It is for hiring a team of international medical specialists who will formulate the medical data necessary for the planned bots.




IT infrastructure$30,000It is for building the next-generation converged networks that further enhance the platform for the bots and makes them easily accessible from various desktop and mobile environments, and to develop software




Product development$40,000It is for covering the costs of IT specialists, mathematicians, statisticians, and data scientists to implement the medical data, algorithms, and code into one seamless and beautiful bot.
Our team of 25 people has 11 doctors, 10 IT specialists and 4 mathematicians, statisticians, and data scientists.
