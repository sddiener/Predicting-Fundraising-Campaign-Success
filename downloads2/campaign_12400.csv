<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey there friends, I'm Buckethead. I am but a humble observer, but I've got quite the story to tell you. The story is 150+ pages long, but for now we will shoot for Part I, about 30 pages long. Here is a taste:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628629326/quhacppatcukqi0qbif9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>First, I need your help. Dark forces work toward preventing me from sharing this tale and exposing them. With your help, we can breath life into this quest of mystery, dark fantasy, and intrigue. In-fact, I found this ancient tablet, perhaps you can shed some light onto its meaning:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">""In a time of ancient kingdoms, towering castles, and mighty dragons, prosperity was turned to calamity.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Ten Nephilim were born to bear the crowns of Kings.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Unbeknownst to them, their crowns were tainted,</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">And their powers turned wicked, dark... corrupt.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Like a moth to an everlasting flame, the darkness consumed all things</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">And what were once great kingdoms became lands of obscurity and despair.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The source of such malevolence remains shrouded, </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">But there may be one who knows the truth.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">However, long has his soul been lost, and he too corrupted by the dark.""</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some of the information you find in this story may be shrouded in mystery, to keep the finer details a secret, I will tell you the tale in a cryptic form, by way of fragmented story telling. Those who would seek to close my lips are not smart enough to decipher such a tale, but I'm confident that you can. Pay attention to the details, however small, and you will surely understand the grand picture.</p>
<p>The story I aim to share is but a small fraction of a grander tale within a larger series that exists within a vast and expansive universe. For now though, let us take this tale one chapter at a time. Thus, I present to you Kingsblade: The Eldrahn Key, Part I.</p>
<p>You will follow Henryk, the Umbral Knight. His journey finds him lost within his own home, the Kingdom of Eldrahn, seeking a mysterious key said to unlock the Virtues of Beryfel. Such Virtues could save Eldrahn, and the entire world of Eos from the darkness that corrupts it, or in the wrong hands, be used as a weapon and destroy it entirely. However, everything aims to confuse and combat him. He finds himself in the Nectre Pool, a vast untime that shows him the unrecognizable faces of the familiar, a burning tree upon a mound of skulls, and a damselfly...</p>
<p>Henryk escapes the confines of a dungeon cell, only to be confronted by the Headsman, but he has been twisted by Moonfyre and the Undying. The bells toll and usher the Umbral Knight into a kingdom fallen to ruin and overrun by foul beasts.</p>
<p>Stick with me and we can unravel the mysteries of this tale, and so many others. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Before I can tell you this grand tale, I'll need your help; as mentioned above. To breath life into the blank pages of the story we will need to work together to come up with $6,725. This will cover all costs regarding penciling, inking, coloring, and lettering for 30 pages at $225 per page. If we were to simply use magic to bring this story forth then we would surely be caught by the dark forces aiming to stop us, don't be silly.</p>
<p>Don't worry though, I am not aiming to empty your pockets, you will be handsomely rewarded for your contributions... just be careful whom you tell, there is no telling who these fiends have embodied. What sort of rewards, you ask? Let me tell you, come closer.</p>
<p>There are 12 potential rewards for you to lay claim to:</p>
<p>- The featured Kingsblade Perk gives the most bang for your buck so keep a close watch out for this one. It even offers you a chance to have your name featured in the story itself by way of a ""RANGR"" Skull!</p>
<p>- Digital Bronze, Silver, &amp; Gold Tier, These are the digital packages that will include a Digital Copy of the story, some Digital Art, and a unique prize indeed. You see, I have stumbled upon a Tattered Journal of sorts. I'm not sure to whom it belongs, but with your contribution I may be enticed to share a page, or even 3, with you. Bear in mind, you may not grasp the same pages as another of the same contribution, and thus we can work together as a community to uncover the secrets and perhaps the identity of whomever owns this relic.</p>
<p>- Physical Bronze, Silver, &amp; Gold Tier, These are the physical packages that offer a more hands-on type of reward. Not only will you possess a Physical Copy of the story, but also a Custom Shirt made by the finest Tailor using the finest of hides collected in the Northern Territories. You may even find a Bronze Token in your pocket; this token grants you access to a lofty Digital Package as well.</p>
<p>- Legendary Bronze, Silver, &amp; Gold Tier, Not satisfied with the previous rewards then consider these relics. I can offer you rewards of limited quantity, never to be produced again. Trading Cards, of sorts, featuring our story's hero; Henryk, the Umbral Knight. You may find yourself with a holographic card, or even one signed by the artisan who crafted such fine artwork. Still not satisfied I see, well what if I told you that I can also offer up a Custom Print of our hero? That sounds pretty good doesn't it? Well, of coarse you still get a Physical Copy of the story, don't be silly. Further your contribution and I can further my offers. Perhaps a Fractured Token can entice you? With it, you can collect a Digital Package as well. I can even speak to the Tailor and with a Silver Token, get you access to his back room where he keeps the truly epic, All-Over Shirts, and I bet if I looked hard enough I could even find a Shadow Henryk Plush in there.</p>
<p>- Moonfyre Collection, This is one of my most coveted rewards, but it comes at a cost most high. However, with it you will find one of grandest collections of relics such as a Signed Physical Copy of the story, all previously mentioned Trading Cards, the Shadow Henryk Plush, an All-Over Shirt, Custom Print, an additional Physical Copy of the story in case the dark forces steal away your other one, and 2 of the rarest prizes that I can offer.   - I can add your face to the story as well. That's right, your very face can be featured within the pages of Henryk's quest.   - However, the greatest gift of all I save for last. I've only 5 copies of the Tattered Journal and each is missing 5 pages. Lucky for us, no one Journal is missing the same 5 pages so perhaps together we can identify its owner and understand their story. Why does the owner have 5 copies of the same journal with different pages missing in each? Probably not a marketing ploy, that's for sure...</p>
<p>- The Umbral Collection, This package offers everything surrounding our hero. Over the years I have followed Henryk's journey and I can offer you much that he has stood close to. Among similar rewards form other packages I can offer you 2 unique rewards not found anywhere else.   - A Henryk &amp; the Nectre Pool Holographic Trading Card. This is amongst the rarest of the offered cards and so it is not given lightly.   - An LED Backlit Print with Snap Frame, so you can let the Umbral Knight shine for all to see.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I must warn you, if our goal is not reached, if the dark forces prevent us from bringing this tale to life then I fear we will have failed. No, I will not allow it. They will not stop us, one way or another I will share this story with the world. Any contributions collected will be put forth to bringing this story to life, come blood, sweat, or tears I will not rest until this story lives. You have my word. How can you trust a man with a bucket on his head? What bucket...? Hey, look at these!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628629533/soaiqzjhtdiskyosjzcy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I have been compiling Henryk's journey for years, and put myself on the line to protect his tale so that one day I could share it with the world. That day is nearing, and your contribution will make it so.</p>
<p>You will not find nothing more than the dark truth behind Henryk's quest. A life torn, a life forgotten, and new born sin. I cannot promise a happy ending, but I assure you it is one that you shall not see coming. </p>
<p>We are on the precipice, and all it takes is a push. So, will you leap into chaos and watch this story unfold alongside me, or will you stand by and let it slip into the abyss? Either way, my bucket will remain sturdy and shine with an unbreakable fervor. What's that? I said nothing of a bucket... This artwork is amazing...</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risk we face in failure is that time will condemn us. Henryk's journey will go unnoticed for an uncertain length of time and my struggle to breath life into this tale will increase. A single voice can be a powerful one, but this speaks to the nature of a thousand voices, each more powerful than the last. Together we can reshape the world.</p>
<p>I have bled for Henryk and his story, and should we fail I will continue to do so, but blood spilt is blood lost. Would it not be better served to pump life into fantasy and escapism? </p>
<p>The world is full of resources and one can accomplish much if resourceful, but a mercenary does not work for free. A Tailor cannot draw life through thread without first possessing said thread. </p>
<p>Do not concern yourself with your rewards, you shall see them. I am a man of my word, and by my bucket I will see your contributions rewarded, though it may take some time longer than expected should we not reach our goal. </p>
<p>Alright, let the bucket thing go already.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Not all have the coin to contribute; this is understandable. You may still assist me, and Henryk for that matter. Spread the word, make it known that Henryk exists and his story is clashing forth, fighting for its life, to be seen by the world. Do this, and you will have contributed to the Umbral Knight's untamed zeal.</p>
<p>There will be those seeking to silence you, to twist your words, and to bend your will. Hold fast, and speak true. There are many tools for sharing beyond only your voice as well. Utilize all at your disposal and we will see the sun shine on a new dawn, a dawn of Moonfyre and the Undying.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Oh, one last thing before you go. Further examination of the Tattered Journal has unveiled a hidden script. Perhaps you can illuminate what escapes me? It reads:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">""Unto</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Folkvangr</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">My</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Damselfly""</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

First, I need your help. Dark forces work toward preventing me from sharing this tale and exposing them. With your help, we can breath life into this quest of mystery, dark fantasy, and intrigue. In-fact, I found this ancient tablet, perhaps you can shed some light onto its meaning:
 
""In a time of ancient kingdoms, towering castles, and mighty dragons, prosperity was turned to calamity.
Ten Nephilim were born to bear the crowns of Kings.
Unbeknownst to them, their crowns were tainted,
And their powers turned wicked, dark... corrupt.

And what were once great kingdoms became lands of obscurity and despair.
The source of such malevolence remains shrouded, 
But there may be one who knows the truth.

Stick with me and we can unravel the mysteries of this tale, and so many others. 
 




 
What We Need & What You Get
Before I can tell you this grand tale, I'll need your help; as mentioned above. To breath life into the blank pages of the story we will need to work together to come up with $6,725. This will cover all costs regarding penciling, inking, coloring, and lettering for 30 pages at $225 per page. If we were to simply use magic to bring this story forth then we would surely be caught by the dark forces aiming to stop us, don't be silly.
Don't worry though, I am not aiming to empty your pockets, you will be handsomely rewarded for your contributions... just be careful whom you tell, there is no telling who these fiends have embodied. What sort of rewards, you ask? Let me tell you, come closer.
There are 12 potential rewards for you to lay claim to:
- The featured Kingsblade Perk gives the most bang for your buck so keep a close watch out for this one. It even offers you a chance to have your name featured in the story itself by way of a ""RANGR"" Skull!
- Digital Bronze, Silver, & Gold Tier, These are the digital packages that will include a Digital Copy of the story, some Digital Art, and a unique prize indeed. You see, I have stumbled upon a Tattered Journal of sorts. I'm not sure to whom it belongs, but with your contribution I may be enticed to share a page, or even 3, with you. Bear in mind, you may not grasp the same pages as another of the same contribution, and thus we can work together as a community to uncover the secrets and perhaps the identity of whomever owns this relic.
- Physical Bronze, Silver, & Gold Tier, These are the physical packages that offer a more hands-on type of reward. Not only will you possess a Physical Copy of the story, but also a Custom Shirt made by the finest Tailor using the finest of hides collected in the Northern Territories. You may even find a Bronze Token in your pocket; this token grants you access to a lofty Digital Package as well.
- Legendary Bronze, Silver, & Gold Tier, Not satisfied with the previous rewards then consider these relics. I can offer you rewards of limited quantity, never to be produced again. Trading Cards, of sorts, featuring our story's hero; Henryk, the Umbral Knight. You may find yourself with a holographic card, or even one signed by the artisan who crafted such fine artwork. Still not satisfied I see, well what if I told you that I can also offer up a Custom Print of our hero? That sounds pretty good doesn't it? Well, of coarse you still get a Physical Copy of the story, don't be silly. Further your contribution and I can further my offers. Perhaps a Fractured Token can entice you? With it, you can collect a Digital Package as well. I can even speak to the Tailor and with a Silver Token, get you access to his back room where he keeps the truly epic, All-Over Shirts, and I bet if I looked hard enough I could even find a Shadow Henryk Plush in there.
- Moonfyre Collection, This is one of my most coveted rewards, but it comes at a cost most high. However, with it you will find one of grandest collections of relics such as a Signed Physical Copy of the story, all previously mentioned Trading Cards, the Shadow Henryk Plush, an All-Over Shirt, Custom Print, an additional Physical Copy of the story in case the dark forces steal away your other one, and 2 of the rarest prizes that I can offer.   - I can add your face to the story as well. That's right, your very face can be featured within the pages of Henryk's quest.   - However, the greatest gift of all I save for last. I've only 5 copies of the Tattered Journal and each is missing 5 pages. Lucky for us, no one Journal is missing the same 5 pages so perhaps together we can identify its owner and understand their story. Why does the owner have 5 copies of the same journal with different pages missing in each? Probably not a marketing ploy, that's for sure...
- The Umbral Collection, This package offers everything surrounding our hero. Over the years I have followed Henryk's journey and I can offer you much that he has stood close to. Among similar rewards form other packages I can offer you 2 unique rewards not found anywhere else.   - A Henryk & the Nectre Pool Holographic Trading Card. This is amongst the rarest of the offered cards and so it is not given lightly.   - An LED Backlit Print with Snap Frame, so you can let the Umbral Knight shine for all to see.
 
I must warn you, if our goal is not reached, if the dark forces prevent us from bringing this tale to life then I fear we will have failed. No, I will not allow it. They will not stop us, one way or another I will share this story with the world. Any contributions collected will be put forth to bringing this story to life, come blood, sweat, or tears I will not rest until this story lives. You have my word. How can you trust a man with a bucket on his head? What bucket...? Hey, look at these!
 

 
The Impact
I have been compiling Henryk's journey for years, and put myself on the line to protect his tale so that one day I could share it with the world. That day is nearing, and your contribution will make it so.
You will not find nothing more than the dark truth behind Henryk's quest. A life torn, a life forgotten, and new born sin. I cannot promise a happy ending, but I assure you it is one that you shall not see coming. 
We are on the precipice, and all it takes is a push. So, will you leap into chaos and watch this story unfold alongside me, or will you stand by and let it slip into the abyss? Either way, my bucket will remain sturdy and shine with an unbreakable fervor. What's that? I said nothing of a bucket... This artwork is amazing...
 




 
Risks & Challenges
The risk we face in failure is that time will condemn us. Henryk's journey will go unnoticed for an uncertain length of time and my struggle to breath life into this tale will increase. A single voice can be a powerful one, but this speaks to the nature of a thousand voices, each more powerful than the last. Together we can reshape the world.
I have bled for Henryk and his story, and should we fail I will continue to do so, but blood spilt is blood lost. Would it not be better served to pump life into fantasy and escapism? 
The world is full of resources and one can accomplish much if resourceful, but a mercenary does not work for free. A Tailor cannot draw life through thread without first possessing said thread. 
Do not concern yourself with your rewards, you shall see them. I am a man of my word, and by my bucket I will see your contributions rewarded, though it may take some time longer than expected should we not reach our goal. 
Alright, let the bucket thing go already.
 


 
Other Ways You Can Help
Not all have the coin to contribute; this is understandable. You may still assist me, and Henryk for that matter. Spread the word, make it known that Henryk exists and his story is clashing forth, fighting for its life, to be seen by the world. Do this, and you will have contributed to the Umbral Knight's untamed zeal.
There will be those seeking to silence you, to twist your words, and to bend your will. Hold fast, and speak true. There are many tools for sharing beyond only your voice as well. Utilize all at your disposal and we will see the sun shine on a new dawn, a dawn of Moonfyre and the Undying.
 
Oh, one last thing before you go. Further examination of the Tattered Journal has unveiled a hidden script. Perhaps you can illuminate what escapes me? It reads:

A Tale Spanning the First Ages of Time and Space   
The universe begins in chaos, a world forms at its centre and life springs forth upon it. The world of Ines.

After a thousands of years of peace, a darkness arises and threatens all life. It brings forth a plague that mutates the bodies of the dead and creates monsters which spread out with one mission: KILL ALL LIFE. 

The peoples of the world, the Homin and Orested, band together with their creators, the Dragi, to fight back the terror. Ultimately the Dragi defeat the evil creature at the cost of their lives.
 
Peace returns to the world and time winds forward through history until the Age of the Angelous, the new ruling race of the planet. A hybrid of the Homin and Orested, they inherit the power the Dragi once processed. 

The evil was not fully defeated and it now returns in a diminished, but no less dangerous form. After several lost battles against this new foe, the Angelous retreat to their flying cities and abandon the surface dwellers, betraying their role as protector.

 A secret group forms within the Angelous military bent on helping the surface and ridding the world of this ancient evil. This elite group of deeply spiritual and moral warriors is lead by the great High Judicar Phasenion.

His young, head strong,  but loyal student, Onixia, is tasked with the burden of finding the one thing that can save the world after a terrible tragedy.  As the events unfold, Onixia must complete this task or all life in the world shall perish.

“Of Time and Space” is a callback to the Sci-Fi and Fantasy tales I was influenced by as a child, with some inspiration from religion and myths.
The Lunar Rise is the first Chapter of the 5 chapter spanning saga that is Of Time and Space. There are 5 Chapters mapped out for the whole story that follow a linear progression over thousands of years on the planet Ines.
By helping to fund this you are helping to fund many more stories to come in this saga.

Mugs hold 11oz of liquid.Cover Art Mug:Replacing the ""Making Of"" book from the last campaign is a new Art Journal. It covers much of the same ground as the previous book but is more of an historical ""gallery"". In it you'll see more work from earlier versions, more of the current work and some of the work that will influence the future books. It's light on text and heavy on images, perfect for anyone that wants to see a 20 year creative process step by step.Art Journal:Last but not least is the one of a kind Original Art tier! That's right original art! The art will be done by Rob Cannon in black and white, it will feature 4 different 4x5 inch character art images. The art will come packed in a synthetic leather bound folio, with the pieces pressure mounted into a matte. This folio is for both delivery and presentation, the pieces can be removed from the matte at anytime if you wish. Only one of these will be available for this campaign. The art is not yet completed but here's an image of how it will come presented.Original Art Folio:  Stretch Goals$4030 CND - Backer Pages! - Pages featuring backer names will be added as a thank you to everyone that made the book happen.$5000 CND - Add Trading Cards! - Every backer gets a set of 12 collector cards featuring key art from the book, samples below. $9000 CND - Add Colour! - Our most needed and wanted stretch goal is to put colour into the entire book, to do that we need to raise a little over double of our goal to finish the book. Rob's work deserves colour and I hope we can make this goal and have him add it in. You can see the difference in the samples below.More unlocked as the campaign progresses! How This Project Will Impact Me and YouBy backing this project you will be funding the start of many more stories to come. This is but a mere drop in the pond of the grand story I wish to tell. It will be a thoughtful tale aimed at capturing the glory and feel of the classic Sci-Fi and Fantasy stories with a good helping of spiritual exploration. By backing this you will insure the completion, of what very well may be my life's work, and allow me to bring that story to a wider audience.  Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge faced by this book is raising enough to finish the artwork and pay for the printing and shipping. We failed to raise funds on the first run and really need to make it this time. It is a huge financial risk to myself but with the help of the backers we can make this happen.

<h3>Who are our characters?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Part-Time</strong>: After close to two decades of fighting the good fight, PT has grown weary of endlessly wandering from one town to the next. Despite his weariness, he's still trying to unravel the mystery of how his newly-discovered energy gloves actually work.</li>
<li>
<strong>Rose</strong>: With an insatiable lust for adventure, Rose is anything but ordinary. Armed with her dual Walther P99 pistols and realm teleporter, she's the deadly dame you want by your side when danger comes a-knockin'.</li>
<li>
<strong>Professor Phantom</strong>: Mischievous, inventive, and deadly, the Professor's polymathic skills know no limits. Coupled with her manipulative psionic powers and self-created Zyborgs, Professor Phantom is the very definition of a global threat.</li>
</ul>
<p>What are the Realms? When traveling to the different realms, think Sliders (yes, that awesome sci-fi show from the '90's starring everyone's favorite actor Jerry O'Connell), and Rick and Morty. So parallel/alternate Earths.</p>

Rose: With an insatiable lust for adventure, Rose is anything but ordinary. Armed with her dual Walther P99 pistols and realm teleporter, she's the deadly dame you want by your side when danger comes a-knockin'.

Professor Phantom: Mischievous, inventive, and deadly, the Professor's polymathic skills know no limits. Coupled with her manipulative psionic powers and self-created Zyborgs, Professor Phantom is the very definition of a global threat.

What are the Realms? When traveling to the different realms, think Sliders (yes, that awesome sci-fi show from the '90's starring everyone's favorite actor Jerry O'Connell), and Rick and Morty. So parallel/alternate Earths.

What We Need & What You'll Get
As the writer and artist of Realm Raiders, I'd like to thank you for helping me achieve my dream of publishing a comic book. All of the funds raised from this campaign will be dedicated to getting this book into your hands by Halloween. Your contribution guarantees the following:


The book will be fully colored by Robb Miller, printed on high quality paper, and shipped directly to you
All books will be signed and numbered
Every book will have a quick head sketch drawn by yours truly

The book is 100% laid out. All it needs it to be tightened up and inked, colored and lettered. After that, it's to be edited and off to the printer and into your hands!

<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>I am digitally penciling and inking the entire book and am currently 10 pages into the process. The book is completely scripted and ready to be drawn. It will be professionally lettered and once we reach our goals will be professionally colored.</p>
<p><strong>The basic out-the-door book will consist of 100 luscious black and white pages fully inked wrapped in a perfect bound cover and each book is signed.</strong> So the intial funding goal is set for <strong>$4000.00</strong> which covers the printing, packaging and production costs.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the initial funding goal of <strong>$4000</strong> I will give a <i><strong>free hard copy or digital copy of my sketchbook to all backers. </strong></i></p>
<p>If we can reach <strong>$15,000.00</strong> the book will get the color treatment, <strong>100 full color pages</strong>!</p>
<p>If we can reach <strong>$20,000.00 </strong>I will extend the book with <strong>additional pages</strong> including <i>character break downs/information and WIP sketches</i>.</p>
<p>If we can reach <strong>$30,000.00</strong> all editions of the book will be <strong>Hard cover </strong>with all the beauty of full color pages as well.</p>

<p>I realized after illustrating books such as <strong>Corey the Zombie Killer</strong>, <strong>Night at the Living Tricon </strong>and <strong>The Man in the Kitty Coat</strong> that I had my own stories to tell.</p>
<p>I have always loved superhero comics so I sat down and poured my thoughts on paper along with a good friend we fleshed out this awesome universe of heros.

<p>Risks and Challenges. Well, with this being 100 pages and doing 80% of the work, time is an issue. I am giving myself enough to fully illustrate/edit and produce this graphic novel with  manageable rewards to get a great book in your hands.

Our material is random and wildly diverse covering every and all things, and ranges from PG to PG-13 (and our paramount goal is to NEVER go beyond that). We certainly don't mind being labeled ""irrelevant to a functional society"" and/or ""crap'tastic!"" But we prefer to stay somewhere between ""mildly offensive"" to ""Oh, my god!""</p><p>FYI, if by chance one of our lovely illustrations somehow ruffles your feathers or offends you... don't worry!

Walking Backwards Comic SeriesA heavenly and diverse collection of wonderfully conceived and drawn comedic masterpieces and dumbfounded tomfoolery!  So heavenly in fact, they even rival that of Michelangelo's 'Sistine Chapel'  -as both finished works prove to demonstrate nothing less than pure divine intervention, and artistic sacrifice.  And so what(!?!) if ours just happened to be inspired and conceived vertically instead of horizontally!?!  I mean, ""po-tay-to"" ~ ""po-tah-to"" right!?!  -on a beautiful church ceiling, or the stall doors of funky public toilets  ...really, what's the big deal!  :)Truly though, we just hope to add some joy to each of your lives. And if you like, and kinda understand what your about to see (?)... don't worry! -because this is just a taste! Trust us! -there's plenty more cheese ball stupification where this came from!  :)  Funding and PurposeAll hopeful and grateful funds, will be used to expand the 'Walking Backwards' series to greater mediums (e.g., a Walking Backwards website; the addition of water color(s); possible syndication, and/or publication, etc.).  Our basic goal is to share our hair-brain ideas with the world, while still being able to feed ourselves at the same time. In the end, we just desire to earn a living doing something we love, by hopefully creating something you'll love. And we don't need much, but a little training-wheels push start... to help get us on our way. Thank you!The following content contains thirty ""single-panel"" style, black and white 'Walking Backward's' example comics, for your hopeful viewing pleasure. Our material is random and wildly diverse covering every and all things, and ranges from PG to PG-13 (and our paramount goal is to NEVER go beyond that). We certainly don't mind being labeled ""irrelevant to a functional society"" and/or ""crap'tastic!"" But we prefer to stay somewhere between ""mildly offensive"" to ""Oh, my god!""FYI, if by chance one of our lovely illustrations somehow ruffles your feathers or offends you... don't worry! Our creative minds are bias-free, and we proudly consider ourselves an equal-opportunity offender! So just sit tight... you'll soon see that vindication and tranquility awaits you just around the corner!  :)Once your viewing is complete, feel free to either throw flowers and praises our way, or tomatoes and insults! We're big immature boys... we can take it! And now, let the madness begin... (legal disclaimer, a.k.a. ""fine print"": the following material was conceived and drawn by a couple of nitwits, and may prove to significantly lower your current said, ""I.Q.""  Therefore, 'Walking Backwards' is not responsible for any confusion, vertigo, and/or dumbing down you may experience!  -enter at your own risk!)...  :)         (The billboard ad states: 'Biff's Fine Back Pocket Combs' - Since 1979 - Remember Our Motto: - ""If It Ain't Biff's... You Gotta Stranger In Your Rear!"")    (Dialogue: -left: ""Great... there goes the neighborhood!"" -right: ""Yeeep!"" -coffee cup: ""#1 Dad"")                                                                                          ...the end!  For now...   :)",30.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hinikarigi everyone, (that means greetings in HoChunk my native language) my name is Little Crow D. GreenCrow and I love to write stories! </p>
<p>What I am bringing to this project is my COMIGA (the fusion of comic book + manga) called Magician’s Tribe.  I started writing the Magician’s Tribe after I graduated from highschool back in 2010. I came up with my characters and the world that they live in and had it just about completed in 2013. Unfortunately, I had to put it away because I couldn't find the right art style to bring this awesome story to life. It was put away and I sorta forgot about it until sometime around 2019 when I met a French artist named Ramy. We would talk for hours about comic books and Anime. One time while talking about our favorite stories and art forms I brought up my story Magician’s Tribe. We talked and discussed it’s incredible world and characters and how I thought his art style would be perfect. Ramy loved it as well, he said we should bring this alive and spread it across the world. So after a few months of rewriting and polishing it up, the old story has a new life and thanks to Ramy an incredible art style to illustrate it. I brought Magician’s Tribe to Indiegogo so it can get funded.</p>

<h3>What is Magician's Tribe?</h3>
<p>Darrin Ashfield a young Crow man from Montana has recently graduated from high school and doesn't know exactly what he wants to do with his life. For some much needed rest and relaxation and to contemplate his future he heads off to Canada to have a visit with his cousins. He decides to travel via ship believing the tranquility will help focus and calm his mind. After boarding the ship unaware of the danger before him, Darrin is attacked and captured. He has been captured by a group of renegades that calls themselves Matadors aka the Slayers.  They are an ancient order that have been battling against Magicians for centuries. Magicians are living beings with supernatural gifts, some possessing powers so great that they can even warp reality. After being captured Darrin was experimented on with a new biological weapon that was made to eradicate magic. His body endured, it changed him, it triggered his dormant gifts and it awoke his power of Lightning. He struck down his captors with his new profound power, freeing himself and others who had been captured. But despite Darrin now being free, his body has changed and now he is no longer a normal human but instead a fully awaken-Magician. Slayers will start to come after him because Darrin now knows of their secret of starting a Holy War across the world. He decides that he will face the Slayers head on, preparing to stop their upcoming holy war with his new powers.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What we need to fund this project is an estimated amount of Fifteen Thousand dollars. When we reach our goal, every buck that you give will be put to good use such as making the chapters, printing the copies and shipping them out to you our gracious donors. Including paying my artist to draw and ink each page and panel. Next is to send you guys our printed COMIGA book with your goody bag. Also the funds will be used for research, materials and publishing for future chapters. A lot of hard-work has been put into making this COMIGA series and I want to deliver you guys the best story that you can have to read and love!</p>

<h3>The Challenges</h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenges will be producing and delivering everything to you on time. When it comes to shipping and communicating, I will be on top of things and get the orders out as quickly as possible. Once the chapters are finished, then all I need to do is send it off to the printers. I will keep everyone updated on progress and on delivery. So everything is in place as much as possible to ensure smooth production and delivery by the end of Summer (August) or end of 2020. I also want to let you know my donors sometimes an unexpected problem or delay may arise. I will deal with it and find a way to get the job done.</p>

<h3>Ever wonder what happened to comic books featuring superheroes doing stuff like taking on Bank robbers? </h3>
<p>In this age of reboots, retcons, and multi-issue cross-over events that span the multiverse, many in the comic book industry today would say a superheroes vs. bank robber comic is too hokey to work. However, with Isis: All that Glitters, I wanted to show that it’s possible to put a  fresh take on the classic superheroes vs. bank robber story and make it fun and exciting for comic book readers in the 21st Century.</p>
<p><i>Isis: All That Glitters </i>will be 62-page perfect bound graphic novel featuring an action packed adventure where the goddess next door takes on a bikini clad bank robber in a family friendly all-ages superhero story filled with action, adventure and a little humor. It’s the kind of comic book I used to used to pick up as a kid at the grocery store, and the newsstand back in the late 1980s and shared with my family and friends. I'd love to share that comic with you but I need your help.</p>
<p>To publish the Isis: All That Glitters graphic novel, I need your help to raise funds to pay:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bill Walko to pencil and ink all 62 interior pages, </li>
<li>A colorist to color Bill's finished pages and flatten them,</li>
<li>A letterer to lay out the dialogue of the story and the sound effects,</li>
<li>and the cost to print and ship the finished paperback and digital editions to readers along with any indiegogo fees.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've been writing and publishing Isis series books <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Isis-Amaris-Revenge-Shawn-James/dp/148110067X/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1544928764&amp;sr=1-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">since  2012</a>. And I've been working with Bill Walko to design covers for the Isis series <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Isis-Wrath-Cybergoddess-Shawn-James/dp/1495352366/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr="" rel=""noopener nofollow"">since 2014</a>. With the first Isis graphic novel I want to give readers an action packed oldschool all-ages comic book just like the ones I used to pick up at the newsstands, the grocery stores, supermarkets and drugstores in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. </p>

In this age of reboots, retcons, and multi-issue cross-over events that span the multiverse, many in the comic book industry today would say a superheroes vs. bank robber comic is too hokey to work. However, with Isis: All that Glitters, I wanted to show that it’s possible to put a  fresh take on the classic superheroes vs. bank robber story and make it fun and exciting for comic book readers in the 21st Century.
Isis: All That Glitters will be 62-page perfect bound graphic novel featuring an action packed adventure where the goddess next door takes on a bikini clad bank robber in a family friendly all-ages superhero story filled with action, adventure and a little humor. It’s the kind of comic book I used to used to pick up as a kid at the grocery store, and the newsstand back in the late 1980s and shared with my family and friends. I'd love to share that comic with you but I need your help.
To publish the Isis: All That Glitters graphic novel, I need your help to raise funds to pay:

Bill Walko to pencil and ink all 62 interior pages, 
A colorist to color Bill's finished pages and flatten them,
A letterer to lay out the dialogue of the story and the sound effects,
and the cost to print and ship the finished paperback and digital editions to readers along with any indiegogo fees.

I've been writing and publishing Isis series books since  2012. And I've been working with Bill Walko to design covers for the Isis series since 2014. With the first Isis graphic novel I want to give readers an action packed oldschool all-ages comic book just like the ones I used to pick up at the newsstands, the grocery stores, supermarkets and drugstores in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. 





As the publisher of the SJS DIRECT imprint I have over a decade of experience in indie and digital publishing and I've written and published over 60 paperbacks and ebooks on a semiannual publishing schedule on digital platforms like Lightning Source, Amazon's Kindle, Barnes & Noble Press, and Smashwords since 2009.  In the past I have run successful Kickstarters  to pay for cover art and I maintained transparent communication with all my backers and got all the rewards out to all my readers in a prompt fashion. This is my first time working with a creative team on a project, and I believe we can get the graphic novel out to backers quickly once it's funded. 
Right now the script and the cover for Isis: All That Glitters are finished, and you can read the first ten pages of the script.  And I definitely plan on keeping all the backers updated on the progress of the project as we go along!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Greetings we appreciate you taking out the time to come this far and get more information on our campaign. Your one step closer to being apart of the family as a backer. As previously stated we decided to push the boundaries of the norm &amp; package it in a way the people would love it. We met that goal and more and since we appreciate the love we wanted to reciprocate by stepping it up a notch and create a cartoon based off of our 1st comic series. We believed it was important  to help give a voice to a sect of The underrepresented in the comic industry so we made a statement when our very 1st comic series was about all women. We feel Art is supposed to positively progress mankind and you’ll be aiding our mission of love,art &amp; creative control by joining the A.I. Comic family as a backer.</p>
<p>We are seeking $15,000 for this project. This covers the cost for us to pay our animators to produce professional quality work. </p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal funds will be saved in a separate account and our ram will launch another campaigns to raise the difference.</p>
<p>The only challenge we would have to conquer after that point would be a vigorous casting call for voice over opportunities for the cartoon. By making it to CBS NEWS,Radio Promotions, podcasts we feel every challenge is worth it when your creating art for change.</p>
<p>If you believe in our vision and want to be apart of a professional team using their art as a message for change then becoming a backer today will make sense. Then make sure you tell like minded individuals so we can grow the community together.</p>

 Meet The CreatorI've been an engineer for 30 years and have degrees in nuclear, aerospace, and mechanical engineering. I've used this to integrate actual science into over the top science fiction in the technology used to power a cyborg shark.I've wanted to write comic books all my life, but I didn't know any artists and didn't know how to draw. But I've always been good with computers. So when I had the idea for Shark of War, I knew I had to get it made no matter what. I spent the last year learning the different digital drawing and modeling programs that let me create exactly what I envisioned.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Yvette Kendall, I'm from the SouthSide of Chicago and the author of GOD Maps SciFi Series, is a fantasy writer and inventor. GOD Maps is the first in a series of novels that surrounds the fringe scientific team of LAB-J71. The team's leader, Dr. Ameerah Mahar is the head of the lab, therefore the story begins with her. The category in which the series is written is a new sub-genre, ""Biblical Fiction/Biblical Futurism"". The themes are heavy in Science/Technology-driven Innovations, which are dramatically paired with Religion and Philosophy. The content can be extreme and is filled with quotes that are reminiscent of great minds through history.</p>
<p>The birth of this story conceived another creation. A Comic Book Series that is an adaptation of The GOD Maps. I feel that a Comic Books Series is a natural next-step due to the Superhero/Villain overtones sewn into the novel. I'm especially proud of the cover, since the main character (Dr. Ameerah Mahar) is modeled in my daughter's likeness. You can catch a glimpse of the cover at (<a href=""http://www.thegodmaps.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.thegodmaps.com</a>). Many may find my work controversial, but I ask that readers to remember ""It's only SciFi!""</p>
<p>Sure....Comic Books are everywhere and done by just about everyone. However, there's one group in particular that is not as well represented as we should be. Women of Color as writers of comic books and appearing as the lead in comic books are slim to none, and I want to change that (with your help).</p>

<p>The funding that were requesting is straight forward and crystal clear. We need to pay artists, pencilers, inkers, writers for the adaptation, printing and some marketing. That's It &amp; That's All!</p>

His father had a criminal record. Mother was an ordinary woman who loved her son and raised her in a spirit of freedom, as she it understood.</p><p>In the 1990s, when the ""Iron Curtain"" collapsed between the West and the Soviet Union, for the people of this large, multinational country, appeared a possible to taste the values of a closed world for us. For some people this became opportunity to leave abroad, for others who have experienced spiritual hunger - this is an opportunity to get acquainted with the Bible, with a book that was forbidden in every way.</p><p>At that time Oleg was already married and had the first child is Andrew. Once he have heard a Christian preacher and was fascinated by the nature of that life, which the Bible spoke about and eventually became a preacher in a small church in the city of Skadovsk (this is on the ""Black Sea""). Gradually, in his mind has grown the idea to convey to their children the history of real, non-Hollywood heroes who are not with a sword in their hands, but</p><p>""through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, the aliens ... others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they could have got a better resurrection: And others had a trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, and of bonds and imprisonment: They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, they were tempted, they were slain with the sword: they were wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented; Of whom the world was not worthy: they were wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth. And these all, having received a good report through faith, received with some better things for us, that they should not be made perfect ""(He.11: 33-40).</p><p>About these heroes told the Bible, such a hero was Christ himself - the eternal God, who became a man. But Oleg, wanted to discover for his children are Andrew and Vitale, more modern Christian heroes and since he was a little bit able on drawing, he decided to start creating a book that, along with the growth of his children every day opened a new page of Christian-American history. The basis of the narrative was taken by real Christian heroes who, with the feat of their lives, in love of God, in the true principles of life and in the love of freedom, laid the foundations of the American Constitution. Basically, it's Roger Williams, the founder of the State of Rhode Island, and a Jewish Christian Joseph Wolf, who in his childhood was expelled from the house for believing in Christ. He became a great missionary traveler who carried the knowledge of God in that corners of the earth, which he could achieve by his travels. Eventually, in August 1837, Wolff arrived in New York, and in Washington under President John Adams, he delivered a sermon in the US Congress on the Sabbath day.</p><p>But the book tells a little about them at the end only, giving a conception to readers about those heroes whose life became the inspiration for the creation of the main character of the book John Conor. This is a collected character in the life story whom other heroes of the faith are reflected also, the Puritans, who fled to Holland at first and then to America because of persecution of the English crown and the Anglican church, which showed intolerance to people who more trusted the sacred Scripture than the decrees of the church, which by force of civil law forced people to believe in God.</p><p>The book is called ""The Great Spirit's Brother"" because the hero of the book John will have many meetings with the Indians, live with them and talk about the biblical God who became the Brother for all people and that those Englishmen who crossed the ocean with the cross in their hands, but oppressing the natives of the American land, not treating them with due respect, cutting down their forests and destroying the bisons, they do not carry the true Light of God.</p><p>Oleg loved horses from his childhood, and also read books related to stories about Indians, so in his book some part of the Christian history of the great country of America and his love for Indian culture have come together. Everyone who has already read this book received strong impressions from the book. The book ""The Great Spirit's Brother"" was published in Russian in 2006, but in our environment, it did not get proper propagation. Nobody did this. I decided to resume this project ten years later. I translated this book into English for my own money. My son made a book layout (make-up) to prepare it for printing.

And not only, the book really deserves attention. At some point, he desperate, meeting certain disappointments on the way... Oleg volunteered for the army. I with a prayer to God began to promote the project of his book, which was create by Oleg for 6 years, to show him that God lives... I know and I believe that this book will spread.

</div></div>","The SAV - is a Native American spirit warrior who's tribe was massacred in the late 1870's by Army soldiers but before he became ""The Sav"" he was Kohl of the Forest. Kohl was raised by grizzly bears after his tribes demise until the day him and his grizzly brothers faced off against the Alpha bear which ended with Kohl and his oldest brother dying by the Claws of the Alpha bear... but it wasn't Kohl's time to meet his maker, instead the spirit apparition of his tribes fallen chief appeared, embracing Kohl's soul and turning his energy into a seed to plant in the blood soaked soil where his fallen tribe was massacred... the tree grew over 100 feet tall with the cocoon of ""The Sav"" growing inside of tree, but then on a quite day in the forest the tree suddenly exploded like a bomb freeing ""The Sav"" and releasing him into the crazy world to watch over his people and their sacred lands. (READ HIS ORGINS STORY IN ISSUE #1) 
  Sistine The Sick​ - is a blood thirsty tyrant with a powerful dimension shattering ancient artifact in his possession connected to one of the most monstrous entities in the universe.  Sistine hails from the Black Sands Kingdom in central Africa, a place they say is hotter then the depths of hell.

<h3>The Story -</h3>
<p>A dead body.</p>
<p>A stolen map.</p>
<p>A notorious outlaw.</p>
<p>A thorny situation for some, but for Sheriff Mark Pendleton it's Tuesday. He's used to murders and claim jumping in Hexwood but the murder of Sam Jenkins quickly turns into more than he bargained for. Frank Dugan and the Red Band Gang, the most successful train robbers in the West, are on his doorstep and up to some sort of mischief.</p>
<p>And unfortunately for Mark a big name like Frank Dugan won't keep lesser bad men away. Even as he chases Dugan's gang and tries to unravel his plans things in Hexwood are going badly awry. With only two deputies he's short handed and behind the ball. Something's bound to give.</p>
<p>Life is never easy for a small town in the West. But if Mark can't get things sorted out there'll be nothing left of Hexwood save dust and ashes.</p>
<p><strong><i>Hexwood: Dust and Ashes</i></strong> is a simple tale of magic and vengeance in the Columbian West. It brings you action, adventure and the promise of bigger things to come! <strong><i>Dust and Ashes</i></strong> is the first of the three parts of the <strong><i>Hexwood</i> </strong>story and offers <strong>85 pages</strong> of story.</p>
<p>I'm Nate Chen, a life long story teller and artist. I've spent the last decade and a half writing stories and drawing illustrations to go with them. This is my first attempt at drafting illustrations for a full length story and I hope you're willing to invest in it with me. If you're curious what the story will look like, here's the cover and first eleven pages of raw art for your viewing satisfaction (art and lettering is not final):</p>

In the event that this campaign doesn't reach its goal all contributions will be refunded.</p>
<p>As this is my first campaign I'm keeping perks as simple as I can. There are <strong>two perks just for books</strong> - you can get a single book or buy two at a time to save on shipping, if you and a buddy want to go together and save a few bucks that way. There's also a perk that <strong>adds the wanted poster for Stovepipe Nick</strong>, and a perk that <strong>includes the poster and a hand drawn sketch</strong> by yours truly of a character from the book, drawn on the inside of the front cover.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The lifeblood of culture today is <strong>independent media</strong>. It's where all the great, creative and entertaining stuff is happening and I hope to contribute my own thrilling tales and join the growing indie movement to revitalize our pop culture and entertainment.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As all the art and writing is finished the only major risks in this project come from mistakes in business along the way. Fortunately I have wonderful friends like <strong>Narwhal</strong> of <i>499 </i>fame who have offered me advice and will, hopefully, keep me from the worst mistakes. At the worst I'd hope the biggest dangers of this campaign would be the campaign fulfilling 6 months overdue and I hope that the time I've built into this campaign will let me avoid those possibilities.</p>

<h3>NOTE: This book was fully funded on Kickstarter and will head to the printer shortly after this campaign ends.</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><u>STORY</u></h3>
<p>The year is 2308. Dreadlock and his crew traverse an unforgiving desert landscape of  a war torn plant Earth. What's left of the nearly extinct human race resides in three Mega Cities, 'protected' by a race of sentient cyborg warriors known  as the Reaper Corps. A cyborg army that saved mankind from total annihilation at the hands of the alien Zartori Empire.</p>
<p>Society now consists on Humans, Cyborgs and Cloned humans who, like the Cyborgs were created by the artificial intelligent named FATHER, as soldiers in the inter galactic BORDER WAR with the Zartori. Now, 80 years into Mankind and Earths rebuild, the cyborg protectors have become more like human jailers leading thousands of humans to flee the mega cities to create their own, cyborg free, settlements out in what was later coined The New West.</p>
<p>Neither hero nor villain, Dreadlock lives by his own rules. Yearning to express his human individuality. Control his own destiny. Living free, in search of adventure! Heaven help anyone who gets in his way. NOTE"" Reaper Corps #0 is available in this campaign.</p>

Our goal is FUN ENTERTAINMENT.
It's in our motto: 'MAKING COMICS FUN AGAIN!' We have a shared universe spanning two distinct eras featuring the MODERN ERA with AGENT WILD and the 2308 FUTURE ERA with REAPER CORPS.  Now, we introduce our newest future era book...

NOTE: This book was fully funded on Kickstarter and will head to the printer shortly after this campaign ends.
 
STORY
The year is 2308. Dreadlock and his crew traverse an unforgiving desert landscape of  a war torn plant Earth. What's left of the nearly extinct human race resides in three Mega Cities, 'protected' by a race of sentient cyborg warriors known  as the Reaper Corps. A cyborg army that saved mankind from total annihilation at the hands of the alien Zartori Empire.
Society now consists on Humans, Cyborgs and Cloned humans who, like the Cyborgs were created by the artificial intelligent named FATHER, as soldiers in the inter galactic BORDER WAR with the Zartori. Now, 80 years into Mankind and Earths rebuild, the cyborg protectors have become more like human jailers leading thousands of humans to flee the mega cities to create their own, cyborg free, settlements out in what was later coined The New West.
Neither hero nor villain, Dreadlock lives by his own rules. Yearning to express his human individuality. Control his own destiny. Living free, in search of adventure! Heaven help anyone who gets in his way. NOTE"" Reaper Corps #0 is available in this campaign.

<p>Hello everyone, I'm C. B. Alan. I'm a comic artist from Georgia. I've been working on this comic for the past three years and over 2500 hours, and now I'm ready to bring it to life. </p>
<p>I love the comic book medium, and by contributing to this campaign you will be helping me achieve a life long dream. This comic is my way of giving back to a community that has meant so much to me. I hope to one day inspire others with my works the way I was inspired by all the great artists before me. </p>
<p>The story will focus on a young woman who seeks to avenge her brother's death, but finds herself swept into an adventure she didn't expect. How can she achieve her goal of finding justice for her brother while also contending with the threat she has attracted to her? Can she overcome her loss? What is the ""Leaf of Lost Dreams""? </p>
<p>You can expect lots of action, intrigue, and mystery on this journey, as well as plenty of wonderful heroic fantasy goodness. I hope you are looking forward to it! </p>

<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>The tech-savvy Martians have been repelled! All is back to normal on the savage, jungle world of Venus! Or is it?</p>
<p>Taking place not long after the events in Mars Invades Venus, Mandika of the Mountain Tribe soon finds herself thrust into an adventure that will test her bravery and skill as a warrior!</p>
<p>Amazon of Venus is the brainchild of Canadian Writer/Artist Larry Nadolsky. The book has been edited and lettered by Mark Stanislawski, who publishes it under his Good Ideas Comics self-publishing banner.</p>

<p>The book DOES contain nudity so be aware and please be over 18!</p>
<h2>Our First Campaign!</h2>
<p><strong>Mars Invades Venus</strong> blasted the doors off Kickstarter for Good Ideas Comics, garnering  118 backers and raising almost $2500! Such great support begged for a sequel!</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Some (most... all) of you SURELY have no idea who am I, so here's a quick introduction:<br/>I am a Mexican freelance Industrial  designer, photographer, illustrator, writer and artist.<br/>I've worked in 3D design and modelling as well as animation and book writing.<br/>I've pitched ideas to Cartoon Nework and I will be working on a 1 minute pilot to show them.<br/><br/>...but most importanly, I<i><strong> really</strong></i> like to make Polandball comics, to the point I've been lucky enough to win some Hussar wings at /r/Polandball <i>(specially lucky given how many talented comic creators are within the Polandball community) </i>and have some of my comics translated into many languages. (well, like 3 or 4 languages, tops).<br/><br/>You can find my Polandball comics <i><u><strong><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/yaddar/submitted/?sort=top"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">IN HERE:</a></strong></u></i><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506124488/jqsiejrhplioeqhlvfxe.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><i>(Art Sample)</i><br/> </p></li>
<li><p><i><strong>So... WHAT is Polandball?</strong></i><br/><br/>Polandball is a <strong>webcomic genere </strong>that focuses on Political satire where the characters are balls that represent countries (or states or regions) and it uses a very absurd and silly sense of humor. Since everyone can join into Polandball comicmaking, the stories range from the most realistic and serious and thought-provoking stories to the most nonsensical or political incorrect or fantastic.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506378499/nes5blywwxreyirvqqse.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><i>(Another sample of my artstyle)</i><br/><br/>That's why, given how passionate I am about Polandball comics in general, (and also a history nerd/aficionado) I'd really like to put all that nerdiness into a Graphic novel about the most dark of all Europe's ages... the Dark Ages.<br/><br/>""Yaddar's World History: The Dark Ages (Polandball Style)"" is meant to be a (semi-educative), humorous take on the history of Europe, from AD 1 to AD 1,000, the millenia where the Roman Empire fell and Europe was REALLY not a very nice place to live.<br/>Without Rome, there were no safe roads (or even roads at all), without roads there was no commerce, without commerce there was no progess and everyone just descended into darkness.<br/><br/><strong>The Book will cover history events such as:</strong></p></li>
<li>The Barbarian invations and the Fall or Rome</li>
<li>The Gothic Kingdoms</li>
<li>The Muslim invations of Iberia</li>
<li>The Invations form the North and the East</li>
<li>The Rise of the Franks</li>
<li>The Holy Roman Empire</li>
<li>The Transition to the late middle ages<br/><br/>All with the characteristic silly Polandball Humor along with the best art I can make.<br/><br/>Since this is a flexible-goal campaign, two complementary side-projects will also be funded:</li>
<li>A mini Comic about the Vandals and how they went from humble beginings being abused by everyone to ending up traumatizing Rome forever before claiming Carthage.</li>
<li>A Comic about the very Scoruge of God, The Huns! and how they manage to almost wipe out Europe... at least on the minds of everyone.<br/><br/>The preliminary script for the book contemplates around <strong>80 pages</strong>, (plus the pages of the Vandals and Huns Comics) but the project might as well go up to <strong>100</strong>... it's a large graphic novel covering a lot of history!<br/><br/>With your help, you'll be able to help me making this book a reality, with some cool perks and rewards in return. <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506125041/ztn1rpuyhqbrttayi9zw.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><i>(Another Art Sample, of course the book will be set on the Dark Ages and may or may not include Zero figher planes.)</i>

<h3>Where does the money go.</h3> <ul><li>Well, as a freelance living in Mexico, sometimes is quite hard to spend a lot of time in a project that is not essential to, you know,luxury stuff like eating and paying bills.<br/>So the goal of 6,000 USD would REALLY help to achieve 4 things:<br/><strong>1.- </strong>Helping me with those luxury goods like food and services for a few months (5-7 months) so I can get to work in the book full time without having to hunt for other projects.<br/><strong>2.-</strong> Upgrade to a propper PC so I would be able to work on something better than an Intel 2Ghz with 4 RAM (sigh).<br/><strong>3.-</strong> Helping fund the printing  of the book and other rewards for those who donate the reward ammount stated in the rewards tier.<br/><strong>4.-</strong> Covering the Fees of the campaign.<br/><br/><strong>Rewards and Goals.</strong><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506367738/hpscntv3kdqrynobtv0o.png"" src="""" style=""""/>

<li> While I am confident in my ability to write and draw a comic, (as well as my obsessive level of historical research), this is still my <u><i>first</i></u> crowdfunding project, so it might be a bit of a learning curve at the begining to learn how indiegogo works and it also might a bit of time to set a specific time for completion and delivery, which at the moment I'm setting for mid-2018.<br/><br/>But as long as I keep my backers updated and open to feedback and/or suggestions, I am positive all the challenges will be conquered.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506137893/xjzkfnr9m3rcscttdrt8.png"" src="""" style=""""/><i> (yet another Art Sample)</i><br/><br/><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;'>I have less money than Greece, how can I help?</span><br/> </li>
<li>Any dollar helps, it really does, but in the case you don't have the oportunity to contribute, there is still a GREAT way you can help, and that is by sharing this project with all your friends, family, your dog's vet, your coworkers, people on campus, random people on Twitter or Facebook, with that crazy guy at the supermarket, your neighbors, broadcast it into space for aliens to see.<br/><br/>Any share would be also deeply appreciated, and don't forget to tell your friends to share it as well.<br/><br/>That is all... I think... <i>(I will keep updating and imporving the project page).<br/><br/><strong>Thank you!</strong></i>

WHAT is Polandball?Polandball is a webcomic genere that focuses on Political satire where the characters are balls that represent countries (or states or regions) and it uses a very absurd and silly sense of humor. Since everyone can join into Polandball comicmaking, the stories range from the most realistic and serious and thought-provoking stories to the most nonsensical or political incorrect or fantastic.(Another sample of my artstyle)That's why, given how passionate I am about Polandball comics in general, (and also a history nerd/aficionado) I'd really like to put all that nerdiness into a Graphic novel about the most dark of all Europe's ages... the Dark Ages.""Yaddar's World History: The Dark Ages (Polandball Style)"" is meant to be a (semi-educative), humorous take on the history of Europe, from AD 1 to AD 1,000, the millenia where the Roman Empire fell and Europe was REALLY not a very nice place to live.Without Rome, there were no safe roads (or even roads at all), without roads there was no commerce, without commerce there was no progess and everyone just descended into darkness.The Book will cover history events such as:
The Barbarian invations and the Fall or Rome
The Gothic Kingdoms
The Muslim invations of Iberia
The Invations form the North and the East
The Rise of the Franks
The Holy Roman Empire
The Transition to the late middle agesAll with the characteristic silly Polandball Humor along with the best art I can make.Since this is a flexible-goal campaign, two complementary side-projects will also be funded:
A mini Comic about the Vandals and how they went from humble beginings being abused by everyone to ending up traumatizing Rome forever before claiming Carthage.
A Comic about the very Scoruge of God, The Huns! and how they manage to almost wipe out Europe... at least on the minds of everyone.The preliminary script for the book contemplates around 80 pages, (plus the pages of the Vandals and Huns Comics) but the project might as well go up to 100... it's a large graphic novel covering a lot of history!With your help, you'll be able to help me making this book a reality, with some cool perks and rewards in return. (Another Art Sample, of course the book will be set on the Dark Ages and may or may not include Zero figher planes.)

 
Where does the money go. Well, as a freelance living in Mexico, sometimes is quite hard to spend a lot of time in a project that is not essential to, you know,luxury stuff like eating and paying bills.So the goal of 6,000 USD would REALLY help to achieve 4 things:1.- Helping me with those luxury goods like food and services for a few months (5-7 months) so I can get to work in the book full time without having to hunt for other projects.2.- Upgrade to a propper PC so I would be able to work on something better than an Intel 2Ghz with 4 RAM (sigh).3.- Helping fund the printing  of the book and other rewards for those who donate the reward ammount stated in the rewards tier.4.- Covering the Fees of the campaign.Rewards and Goals.

 (Another Art Sample, featuring China and Japan... I really like swords and stuff) 
Risks and Challenges: 
 While I am confident in my ability to write and draw a comic, (as well as my obsessive level of historical research), this is still my first crowdfunding project, so it might be a bit of a learning curve at the begining to learn how indiegogo works and it also might a bit of time to set a specific time for completion and delivery, which at the moment I'm setting for mid-2018.But as long as I keep my backers updated and open to feedback and/or suggestions, I am positive all the challenges will be conquered. (yet another Art Sample)I have less money than Greece, how can I help? 
Any dollar helps, it really does, but in the case you don't have the oportunity to contribute, there is still a GREAT way you can help, and that is by sharing this project with all your friends, family, your dog's vet, your coworkers, people on campus, random people on Twitter or Facebook, with that crazy guy at the supermarket, your neighbors, broadcast it into space for aliens to see.Any share would be also deeply appreciated, and don't forget to tell your friends to share it as well.That is all... I think... (I will keep updating and imporving the project page).Thank you!",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The story of Willie Mooch will (hopefully) continue in this second edition of the Willie Mooch series. In order to make that happen I need your help with funding. There were some really great reactions to part 1 of this series and I am excited to continue to sharing Mooch's journey with you in part 2. Please help me produce part 2.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p><strong>- </strong>So for transparency the total cost of production for chapter 1 was beyond $1,500. But there were some great lessons learned during that process and I think I can keep things to a minimum going forward.</p>
<p>- I'd like to ask for $500 of funding or whatever you can share.</p>
<p>- These funds will go towards production, which includes, the time it takes produce the artwork and the cost of printing.</p>
<p>- I plan to have some pretty cool perks available for donors:</p>
<p>* Willie Mooch Character Pins</p>
<p>* Stickers</p>
<p>* And exclusive artwork of Willie Mooch perform some famous cons.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- Some of the challenges I foresee with producing this chapter is with printing and shipping. With chapter 1 I used KDP (Kindle Direct Publishing), Amazons publishing platform with print on demand services. But with this I chapter release I went a different route by starting my own publishing company and website in hopes of retaining a higher percentage of revenue in order to reduce the cost it takes to produce these.</p>
<p>This process is much more streamlined and should see a quicker turnaround for part 2 of this comic series. Join us on the journey #bigmoochcampaign</p>

<h3>My Entire Tragic Life Story:</h3>
<p>  I am Piglice, and Relevant Saxon is the comic I've been drafting up for the last several months. It's the story of a medieval warrior adventuring through the near-future, in New York. This book has everything. It has blood, It has swords. It has buff men. It has buff women. It is scratch-and-sniff (every single page).<br/>  If you like to support Indie comics, or by chance you actually think this comic book looks flipping epic and would like to gift it to everyone you know (coworkers, family, police officers, your lawyer, your therapist, your FBI agent, your victims, etc.), then please do consider buying a copy.<br/>  Supporting this comic book will enable me to pay people to help me make this comic book better and faster. I am an all around decent artist and write and can cover each role in a comic book, but it is not easy by any means. Even being able to pay a guy to color a few panels or ink 3 tiny pixels here and there greatly helps me push each issue to it's final stage.</p>

<h3>I Want It Right Now:</h3>
<p>  My evil goal with this first issue of the book is to raise 500 dollars. If more people buy it, then awesome. If not, 500 will help me on my way to making the next issues better.</p>
<p>  I have never funded a comic for money so no you can absolutely not trust my long track record of being a professional Indiegogo comic artist. I have however printed and given my comics out for free so I do feel familiar and comfortable with shipping and printing and everyone's books out to em on time. The last book I did this with was called Red Meat and the art was horribly embarrassing. Since then I have been working in animation, concept art, and storyboarding.</p>

<h3>Risks:</h3>
<p> Everything. I'm risking everything. You? You risk nothing here. You are guaranteed to receive a beautiful 20 page work of art in the mail. Me? I'm risking my long term romantic relationship. I'm risking my health. I'm risking a beautiful full head of hair as the stress gets to me, corroding me, the money corrupting me, making me appear on the outside the way I am on the inside.

I was a child of the '90s, so I grew up with a healthy dose of Image comics and anime. Art and storytelling was always a passion of mine.

<p>It is good to have warnings, but it is better to have goals. Science-Fiction is full of important stories warning us about the dangers of our hubris. That is a useful lesson, but it shouldn't be all we use the genre for. I grew up watching Star Trek, a show about exploration, progress, and ethics.

<p>Peter Swynn is a cloud shepherd, a small boy with a
flock of clouds he calls his own. Peter is tending these clouds as
others are tending sheep. With his magic crook and his flute he leads
the clouds to bring rain to the woodlands and farmers. Together they are wandering the
mountains and highlands of Sandora – an island beyond the
storm-whipped icy seas of Seolia – last refuge of all magic
creatures. Wherever they go they are welcome and appreciated as they
would bring rain to the crops, or so they thought...</p>
<p></p>
<i>""On this mild night Peter was playing his lullaby again to the clouds. One by one the still ruffled clouds gathered around the tune and a cozy tranquility started to settle in. Peter had no idea what was lying in wait for him down in the misty valley: loss, adventure, war, as well as his fate, friendship and love. Even more unexpected was the circumstance that he, despite all his inconspicuousness, would hold all magic peoples' fate and happiness in his small hands.""</i><p></p>

<p><span>Hi!
 The best way to quickly describe myself is by saying that I'm in love 
with painting... I've always been and I'll always be. I'm a matte

<p><span>I've been doing this for a while now, living in Torino, Los Angeles, London, Stuttgart, Hamburg and Munich. <br/></span></p>
<p><span>Recently my matte paintings for ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" have been awarded with the Oscar in Best Production Design. You can see my works in other films as </span><span>""Cloud

<p><strong>D.A.R.E Agents Issue #1</strong> is a 32 page, Euro-spy, action/comedy comic with suave spies, bumbling henchmen, ridiculous evil genius schemes and inappropriately named 'Femme Fatales'.

<p>My name is Adin Milo and I'm an illustrator from Sydney, Australia. I grew up on movies like James Bond and Austin Powers, as well as vintage 60s cartoons, including The Pink Panther and Hanna Barbera. Growing up being obsessed with writing movie scripts and drawing the characters in my school books. The idea of creating comics was something I dreamed about since I started putting pen to paper as a kid. And recently I never thought of fusing the two together - until now. <br/> </p>
<p>These last 5 years have included me working with professional companies and passionate developers. These include working on projects with Rubber House (Childish Gambino - ""Feels Like Summer"" Video Clip &amp; HBO Game Of Thrones ""Slap Game"" short), Sleepyhead Studios Barking Irons game, and Mirrafire Games ""Pack of Crooks"".</p>

Think 'Fritz the Cat' meets 'Austin Powers'.True to the era, D.A.R.E Agents is brimming with Mid-Century style illustrations and graphical overlays that will have the look and feel of comic lost in the Silver Age of Comics. There is also a whole lot of influences from cheesy B-Grade Italian movies true to the era also. There will also have some mock ads placed throughout the comic.

My name is Adin Milo and I'm an illustrator from Sydney, Australia. I grew up on movies like James Bond and Austin Powers, as well as vintage 60s cartoons, including The Pink Panther and Hanna Barbera. Growing up being obsessed with writing movie scripts and drawing the characters in my school books. The idea of creating comics was something I dreamed about since I started putting pen to paper as a kid. And recently I never thought of fusing the two together - until now.  
These last 5 years have included me working with professional companies and passionate developers. These include working on projects with Rubber House (Childish Gambino - ""Feels Like Summer"" Video Clip & HBO Game Of Thrones ""Slap Game"" short), Sleepyhead Studios Barking Irons game, and Mirrafire Games ""Pack of Crooks"".

<p> </p>

<h3>My SUMMARY For YOU! :)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hi everyone! My name is BELLE! I am 22 yrs old and was born to be an artist! Honestly I'm an artist of music, poetry, writting, to music and etc. I do various of art that expresses the way I think and see the world. I am a very outgoing person who takes the time to listen and see each person's perspective view of this world! The first time I remember drawing was Blossom- from PowerPuff Girls! I was super excited for I was like 3 years old and really into drawing! I am adventurous and have traveled from Puerto Rico, Honduras, California, and various states in the US. My background of being an artist has really started when I was in Fifth grade! I was so fascinated on how some artist can make a painting come to life! They were so professional in making a piece of art look so real as if you were able to just touch it! I searched so many different artists and their tips on how to do art! Then my creativity really took off! In high school I had an amazing Art Teacher that saw in me more than what I could even see! She pushed me hard in art and I am to this day very grateful! Now I do commissions from Pets to Portraits, to cartoons, and more! This is where my introduction of this Campaign starts!</li>
<li>This Campaign honestly its to be able to print my first Comic Book! I currently have all of my comic books digitally so having a physical copy will make my year! Not only will it make my year but it will make me happy that all that supported me will receive a physical copy as well!

Hi everyone! My name is BELLE! I am 22 yrs old and was born to be an artist! Honestly I'm an artist of music, poetry, writting, to music and etc. I do various of art that expresses the way I think and see the world. I am a very outgoing person who takes the time to listen and see each person's perspective view of this world! The first time I remember drawing was Blossom- from PowerPuff Girls! I was super excited for I was like 3 years old and really into drawing! I am adventurous and have traveled from Puerto Rico, Honduras, California, and various states in the US. My background of being an artist has really started when I was in Fifth grade! I was so fascinated on how some artist can make a painting come to life! They were so professional in making a piece of art look so real as if you were able to just touch it! I searched so many different artists and their tips on how to do art! Then my creativity really took off! In high school I had an amazing Art Teacher that saw in me more than what I could even see! She pushed me hard in art and I am to this day very grateful! Now I do commissions from Pets to Portraits, to cartoons, and more! This is where my introduction of this Campaign starts!
This Campaign honestly its to be able to print my first Comic Book! I currently have all of my comic books digitally so having a physical copy will make my year! Not only will it make my year but it will make me happy that all that supported me will receive a physical copy as well! I've been working hard as an artist trying to figure out how to make it as an artist! Honestly it's hard but having great supporters like YOU helps artists like me be able to accomplish their creative goals! I really want this Comic Book to take off and it really means a lot to me!

<h2><strong>What is Em is for Monsters?</strong></h2>
<p><br/>Em Is for Monsters is a comic set in a world not unlike our own—but appearances can be deceiving. In truth, we live in the shadow of another world. Monsters walk among us, and have infiltrated human society in its entirety. Some are shrewd businessmen, others are shambling monstrosities driven by instinct alone; yet all are united unto a singular end: the daily harvest of mortal souls, the currency of Hell. Mankind continues unaware, shrugging off its losses as fate or chance. No such rationalizations come to the minds of children, however, who can see in their nightmarish totality the monsters for what they are. Em is one such child. A kid like any other, obsessed with dinosaurs, but burdened with a thirst for knowledge that lands her in an underworld of trouble.</p>
<p>Follow our plucky protagonist on her murderous misadventures as she collides with Hell’s legions in a bid for mankind’s salvation.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1548615916/vg6oe4rjvwddnwxkemvg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Plus minus thirty pages of beautiful, full-colour illustrations, Em Is for Monsters is a fast-paced, action-packed romp of a read.<br/> <br/>Back it on Indiegogo today!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1548610926/kq84idy01tipaldhsrie.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/>Stephen Spinas is a freelance graphic designer, illustrator and comic book artist from Cape Town, South Africa. Over the last decade, his works have featured in a number of novels, album covers, comic books, audiobooks, advertising campaigns and product labels. A dedicated Twitch streamer, Stephen has also featured on a number of Twitch channels, including UGCZA</p>
<p>Em is for Monsters is an idea that has been in the works for close to three years now, but he needs your help to finish it! As a freelance artist, Stephen’s passion for comic books often has to be set aside, and the grueling hours needed to do justice to such an endeavor become harder to find. Your support will allow him to dedicate his undivided attention to Em is for Monsters, and to create a project he believes you’ll love as much as he does!</p>

<h3>The nitty-gritty:</h3>
<p>In order to work on Em is for Monsters full-time, Stephen will need to hit a target of $9990. This will go toward covering the costs of the various perks, merchandise, shipping, administrative fees, living expenses and the printing of the comic itself. The risks associated with setting aside freelance work during this period are considerable, but successfully attaining the target will go a long way toward alleviating the reservations that any artist has when setting out on a new venture. Aside from the financial risk, there are a number of challenges that Em is for Monsters must overcome before seeing the light of day. First, it is imperative that the prints are of the highest quality. This has, in part, contributed toward the necessary target. In order to ensure that the comic meets the expectations of both the artist and the backers, 115gsm paper will be used for the printing. A higher grade material than the industry standard, Em is for Monsters will be a feast for the eyes! Secondly: <strong>Deadlines! Deadlines! Deadlines</strong>! The comic book will, upon completion, be just over thirty pages. Taking on such a project by oneself is a daunting task, and could take months, even years to complete if one was unable to focus fully upon it. Being able to work on Em is for Monsters full time will, of course, play a huge role in the completion and success of the comic, and it will be all thanks to you!</p>

<h3>The little things: </h3>
<p><br/>Living in South Africa, while amazing, has its drawbacks. Each one of the backing tiers comes with a number of perks. Some of these perks include merchandise. While the merchandise itself can and will be ordered in bulk to keep costs down, shipping and couriering samples can be costly, especially when amendments need to be made. While many manufacturers cover the shipping of samples themselves, this is not always the case. These same shipping costs, which will be absorbed by the project, will add up when it comes to shipping the comic book and perks to you, the excited backer!</p>
<p>While Em is for Monsters is Stephen’s project, finding someone to put his thoughts into words was always going to be a challenge. Fortunately, having done work for indie publishing house Sentinel Creatives, he was able to rope author Mitchell Luthi into the project. Writing and editing costs, while relatively low compared to comparable projects, are a necessity and add to “the little things” that any campaign must take into account.</p>
<p>Creating a comic from start to finish is an herculean task, but sometimes the hardest part is getting the exposure necessary to fund a campaign. A small budget will be dedicated toward advertising, as well as toward promotions at the various conventions in South Africa during this time. That doesn’t mean you can’t help with promoting this campaign! Sharing panels, concept art, links or even just a mention in conversation will go a long way to making this all a success.</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Jason Micciche, the writer and co-creator of Eternal! I've been writing about video games and comics for well over a decade, but now I want to craft my own story. </p>
<p>Fortunately, so does my good friend, professional concept artist Greg Semkow. Greg has worked for some of the biggest entertainment companies around, in both film and video games. He has an incredibly cinematic style, and can build worlds that portray everything from post-apocalyptic nightmares to alien landscapes with vistas beyond imagination.</p>
<p>Now he's come up with a story with Eternal that is just begging to be told. It's a melding of all of the above, with a deep mystery at its core. Eternal is a violent vision of a far off world that harbors cosmic secrets and long dead, eerily human civilizations, and also one where armies of human colonists have been cut off from home. Stranded, many attempt to forge a new life and fight just to survive, while others war over the technology hidden in the ruins of the ancients. Some believe it may hold the key to returning home, while others seek to claim the power of the gods for themselves. </p>
<p>If you think that sounds cool, wait till you hear about the way this bad boy is put together. Eternal will be a 180 page hardcover art book, featuring highly detailed, full-color illustrations printed on gloss coated paper. We like to think of it almost as if you're holding a summer blockbuster right in your hands.</p>
<p>Since Greg is a concept artist, he's no stranger to huge, sweeping visuals. To that end, each illustration in Eternal is going to be a gigantic double-page spread. Where's the story? It'll be printed right on the images themselves, so your eyes never have to leave the artwork, creating the most immersive experience possible.</p>
<p>Here's a taste of what's to come...</p>

<p>To get all of this rolling to press, we need at least $15k USD. That might seem like a lot, but it actually <i>includes</i> a lot. For starters, that'll get the book printed up, but then it'll also take care of the shipping to get it out to every one of you, our backers.</p>
<p>We've chosen a terrific publishing company who looks to do stunning work. We know you're going to love the results of what a top flight printer can do with Greg's visuals.</p>

<h2>What is The God Dream?</h2>
<p>  The famous allegory of Plato's cave suggests that we, as observers, are ignorant to the true nature of reality. He compares the world we experience as shadows of the true world. What is it that casts those shadows? The Paragons. The Paragons are sitting court members of the Perennial Kingdom (the true reality that exists beyond our realm of understamding). They are the foundation to all of societiy's institutions. Concepts like banking, war, and religion, have been brought back from the kingdom to earth by those who had the misfortune of communing with these creatures and managed to maintain their sanity. In this series we will look throughout history at various character accounts of encounters with the Paragons. Each installment will be like a puzzle piece revealing more about the nature of the world and the mysterious Perennial King of The Dream. This first installment introduces The Great Abomination. It is 31 pages, though I may add some bonus pages.</p>
<p><strong>I am having fun creating this world, but I don't want to explore it alone so come for the ride!</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Format</strong></h2>
<p>The format and style of storytelling I use is different than you might be used to. There are no speech bubbles. We will explore the world through character accounts given at the beginning of each installment via journal entries and other writing. This gives the stories a ""found footage"" feel that is reminiscent of the way stories are told in video games. The carefully drawn pages are square, plain, and have 1-4 panels. I will also include suggested songs to listen to during your read. many of these songs were what I listened to for inspiration as I wrote each story. Its a unique viewing experience I assure you! </p>

We aim to be the Netflix for Comics and Mangas.</p><p>We have just started and are offering incredibly affordable subscriptions that cost from 80% to 50% less than our competitors! Not only that, but our unique subscription model also makes sure to reward those who are long time subscribers!</p><p>If you want to follow us please subscribe for our newsletter for updates at: </p><p><a href=""http://signup.xenoga.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://signup.xenoga.com</a></p><p> </p><h3>Introduction</h3><p>Xenoga is an evolution of traditional publishers. Publishers have been slow to move to a digital format, and even then they are sticking to traditional publishing pipelines. This is more apparent in the comic and manga industry.</p><p>I started the Xenoga project because I like reading comics and mangas. The problem is that language localisation is slow and sometimes non-existent. This is due to the ""traditional"" nature of publishers. </p><p>Xenoga is a streamlined integrated publishing platform that allows for instant multilingual/multilanguage support. This means that any content published can immediately be consumed by anyone in the world in any language. It also offers print-on-demand for comics and mangas.</p><p>It has a tremendous value proposition for subscribers and artists/authors alike. And this combination creates a positive feedback loop. More artists/authors means more IP content, which means more subscribers, and vice-versa.</p><p> </p><h3>Subscription Model</h3><p>Currently, we are filling up subscriptions as follows:</p><p>The first 500,000 can subscribe for US$ 10 per year. </p><p>The next 1,000,000 can subscribe for US$ 20 per year. </p><p>The next 1,500,000 can subscribe for US$ 30 per year. </p><p>The next 2,000,000 can subscribe for US$ 40 per year.</p><p>After 5,000,000 million subscribers we use a percentage method following the 1-2-3-4 subscription model as follows:</p><ul>
<li>Tier 1 - 10% of Subscribers at US$ 10 annually.</li>
<li>Tier 2 - 20% of Subscribers at US$ 20 annually.</li>
<li>Tier 3 - 30% of Subscribers at US$ 30 annually.</li>
<li>Tier 4 - 40% of Subscribers at US$ 40 annually.</li>
</ul><p>Who gets to go on to the next Tier is determined by seniority (in sequential subscription date order). So if someone at Tier 1 cancels their subscription then the oldest subscriber at Tier 2 gets promoted to Tier 1, the oldest subscriber in Tier 3 get promoted to Tier 2, the oldest subscriber in Tier 4 get promoted to Tier 3.</p><p>But also the more subscribers the more people at higher levels with better-discounted subscriptions.

We aim to be the Netflix for Comics and Mangas.We have just started and are offering incredibly affordable subscriptions that cost from 80% to 50% less than our competitors! Not only that, but our unique subscription model also makes sure to reward those who are long time subscribers!If you want to follow us please subscribe for our newsletter for updates at: http://signup.xenoga.com IntroductionXenoga is an evolution of traditional publishers. Publishers have been slow to move to a digital format, and even then they are sticking to traditional publishing pipelines. This is more apparent in the comic and manga industry.I started the Xenoga project because I like reading comics and mangas. The problem is that language localisation is slow and sometimes non-existent. This is due to the ""traditional"" nature of publishers. Xenoga is a streamlined integrated publishing platform that allows for instant multilingual/multilanguage support. This means that any content published can immediately be consumed by anyone in the world in any language. It also offers print-on-demand for comics and mangas.It has a tremendous value proposition for subscribers and artists/authors alike. And this combination creates a positive feedback loop. More artists/authors means more IP content, which means more subscribers, and vice-versa. Subscription ModelCurrently, we are filling up subscriptions as follows:The first 500,000 can subscribe for US$ 10 per year. The next 1,000,000 can subscribe for US$ 20 per year. The next 1,500,000 can subscribe for US$ 30 per year. The next 2,000,000 can subscribe for US$ 40 per year.After 5,000,000 million subscribers we use a percentage method following the 1-2-3-4 subscription model as follows:
Tier 1 - 10% of Subscribers at US$ 10 annually.
Tier 2 - 20% of Subscribers at US$ 20 annually.
Tier 3 - 30% of Subscribers at US$ 30 annually.
Tier 4 - 40% of Subscribers at US$ 40 annually.
Who gets to go on to the next Tier is determined by seniority (in sequential subscription date order). So if someone at Tier 1 cancels their subscription then the oldest subscriber at Tier 2 gets promoted to Tier 1, the oldest subscriber in Tier 3 get promoted to Tier 2, the oldest subscriber in Tier 4 get promoted to Tier 3.But also the more subscribers the more people at higher levels with better-discounted subscriptions. Ex. 10 subscribers mean 1 person at Tier 1. But 100 subscribers mean 10 subscribers at Tier 1. And 100,000 subscribers mean 1,000 subscribers at Tier 1. ON-DEMAND PrintingWe are planning to partner with top on-demand printing services like Gelato.com, Blurb, Ingramspark, KDP Print, to offer our subscribers to also purchase physical copies in their own language. Revenue Share ModelAll profits from print-on-demand (POD)  purchases go to the authors/artists.We will run a leaderboard system like football leagues where we will share a percentage of the annual profits to authors/artists (excluding POD Revenue).On top of that, we will also offer monthly salaries to our authors/artists. OUR OfferingWe will recruit authors/artists from all around the world to deliver unique comics and mangas. Language will no longer be a barrier as our service aims to offer multi-language support for all our comics and mangas.Currently, we are in talks with authors/artists from China, Japan, South Korea, Europe, US, and Brazil. If you have suggestions or favourite authors/artists you would like to see featured, please provide information in the comments section. Risks and challengesThe current funding goals is the minimum needed to create the system and starting contents.Anything beyond that can be used to kickstart more content so that when the service starts there will be a lot of content to choose from.Thus a challenge is getting the momentum necessary to quickly grow and scale Xenoga.Since this is an internet-service/software-based there is a much lower risk when compared to other projects selling physical products.The service will be provided and only the quality and depth of the service will depend on the goals and milestones achieved.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Who is the Fist of Justice?</h3>
<p>Fist of Justice was the super-heroic defender of Charm City until he made a fatal mistake that ended his career. Beaten and locked away by his arch-nemesis, he was eventually all but a faded memory.  But his power -- though dormant and forgotten -- did not fully leave him. Now that the power has fully returned and resurrected Fist of Justice, he has to adjust to a new era AND deal with the villains of the 21st century. Villains who are tougher, stronger, and meaner than ever.</p>

<h3>First time? No sweat! We got you covered!</h3>
<p>Are you a first time Fist of Justice reader? This is a great jumping on point. But if you want the <strong>whole experience</strong>, we're also offering both trade paperbacks (Volumes 1 and 2) and single issues (#7) to bring you up to speed!

<h3>Old school. New attitude.</h3>
<p>This issue has a great old school flashback sequence bringing you back to the 70s/80s where Fist of Justice originally came front.</p>
<p>Drawn by the talented <strong>Dario Carrasco Jr</strong> (<i>Star Wars, Alpha Flight</i>) who also drew a <i>Fist of Justice</i> story for us when we first started in <i>Digital Webbing Presents</i>. We were also able to bring in our  previous collaborator <strong>Matt Webb</strong> (<i>The Mask, Hawkman</i>) to color these awesome pages. Matt was the first guy to ever color <i>Hellboy</i> when the character first appeared in <i>John Byrne's Next Men</i>. </p>

<p>Our main story is illustrated by <strong>Mark Robinson</strong> who drew the <i>BloodRayne</i> series for us back in the day. He's also worked for Marvel on titles like <i>Hulk</i> and <i>Ghost Rider</i> plus a ton of others. The main story will be inked by the very talented <strong>Stacie Ponder</strong> who has worked on <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i> and <i>BloodRayne</i>. She's the perfect inker for Mark's pencils! Finally we have <strong>Paul Little</strong> dropping colors! Paul has colored popular titles like <i>Sons of Anarchy</i> and <i>Bomb Queen</i>.</p>

<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>Creators: <strong>Mike Imboden</strong> (Fubar, Living Corpse) and <strong>Ed Dukeshire</strong> (Hulk, Once &amp; Future, Power Rangers) -- Mike writes, Ed letters, and together they hold the tag-team championship. Our team also consists of artist <strong>Mark Robinson</strong> (BloodRayne, Ghost Rider, Hulk), inker <strong>Stacie Ponder</strong> (BloodRayne, Star Trek) and colorist <strong>Paul Little</strong> (Sons of Anarchy, Bomb Queen).  For the  ""Flashback"" scene we have <strong>Dario Carrasco Jr</strong> (Star Wars, Alpha Flight) on art and <strong>Matt Webb</strong> (The Mask, Hawkman) on colors! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is a <strong>no risk</strong> campaign since we've been <strong>fully funded</strong> on another platform. We brought it here in case you missed the first campaign (or prefer this platform) as Fist of Justice is now a <strong>direct-to-consumer</strong> series. Crowd-funding is the only way to get the new single issues!</p>
<p>Most of the issue is already completed with only half the comic needing inks and colors. Once it's ready, it shoots off to the printer and then into your greedy little hands to enjoy!</p>

Or even taking the time to write me a message with your feedback!I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation to the platform NOWDO for their help in the publication and promotion of the comic. They have been an invaluable part of this whole process. You can learn more about NOWDO below or by checking out their webpage.At this moment, our main project consists of raising funds to do the print edition of the first volume of the comic Modern Life of the Immortals (MLTI).We think that this comic is the perfect example of how a precious culture, in this case, Chinese, can expand to other parts of the world thanks to the community on the web. Currently, we have been able to translate it online in English and we are now starting with Spanish. We want now to go a step further and be able to provide the fans with the print edition of the comic, as well as with other special rewards.This campaign is meant to raise funds for this project so we can print the volumes and other special materials and send them to our beloved fans and contributors.At this moment I can't think of any potential risks that could occur during the process.The advantage of this project is that I have already created the comic and the prototypes of the rewards. I have to advise that the images of the rewards are only prototypes and the design may slightly change at the end, in particular with the teddy bear. If that is the case, I will immediately notify you and give you the opportunity to decide whether to continue supporting me or not.The other thing would be the editing process, as it may take a while. The shipping will take a while as well.Last but not least, I have the huge help of the NOWDO team behind me who is going to help me if needed.",8.0,1,"1 Campaign

These times are full of changes, doubt, progress and regression, but above all, opportunities. Internet, the social network and specially the crowd funding platforms are changing everything.

</div><div style=""text-align: center;""> </div></div>","The Enceladus Anomaly is a comic about space horror written and drawn by José Avilés. This work is divided into three volumes and they will be produced through crowdfunding. In this first campaign we're focused on the first book:                        The Enceladus Anomaly - Book 1: The awakening. La Anomalía de Encélado es un cómic de terror espacial escrito y dibujado por José Avilés. Esta obra se compondrá de tres tomos sucesivos que serán producidos a través de la financiación colectiva. En esta primera campaña nos enfocaremos en el primer volumen: La Anomalía de Encélado - Libro 1: El despertar.         
 

          
In the not too distant future, the mankind has reached high levels of technological, scientific and social developments. After overcoming the challenges of earlier times, as the energy supply or natural resources issues, the new generations have achieved to relieve the differences and conflicts betweens nations of Earth. Because of this new context, the space research has revived as never before.
 
En un futuro quizá no muy lejano, la humanidad ha alcanzado altas cotas de desarrollo tecnológico, científico y social. Superados por fin los desafíos de épocas anteriores, como el problema de las fuentes de energía o de los recursos naturales, las nuevas generaciones han conseguido mitigar las diferencias y conflictos entre los países de la tierra. Esto ha provocado, entre otras cosas, un resurgimiento sin precedentes de la exploración espacial.

  
Our story begins with the Táwros II spaceship orbit insertion around Saturn, which resumes the Saturn research mission that was started by its predecessor, the Táwros I spaceship, more than a decade before. The tragic end of the Táwros I, mysteriously crashed on the Enceladus surface, and the strange anomaly that surrounds this Saturn's satellite will be some of the enigmas that the crew of this new spaceship will try to reveal.
 
Nuestra historia arranca con la inserción en la órbita del planeta Saturno de la astronave Táwros II, la cual reemprende la misión de exploración de este planeta y de sus satélites que iniciara su predecesora, la astronave Táwros I, más de una década atrás. El trágico final de la Táwros I, que misteriosamente acabó estrellada en la superficie helada de Encélado, y la extraña anomalía que envuelve a este singular satélite de Saturno, son algunos de los enigmas que la tripulación de la nueva astronave tratará de desentrañar. 

The Main Character of this work is Audra Bissette, the only daughter of Táwros I failed captain and one of the members of the large and trained Táwros II crew. Audra and her companions will face the horror in Enceladus, the dark and unexpected sides of the reality on the space that won't fit with the advanced scientific paradigm of this new mankind.
 
La protagonista de esta obra es Audra Bissette, hija única del capitán de la malograda Táwros I y uno de los miembros de la nutrida y dispuesta tripulación de la Táwros II. Audra y sus compañeros de exploración se enfrentarán en Encélado al terror, a inesperados y oscuros aspectos de la realidad en el espacio para los que el avanzado paradigma científico de esta nueva humanidad no estará preparado.

I'm sure that some of you will agree with me about we are living one of the most refreshing and astonishing age of our short history in this wonderful planet. These times are full of changes, doubt, progress and regression, but above all, opportunities. Internet, the social network and specially the crowd funding platforms are changing everything. They are establishing a new paradigm, a new way to make real our more personal ideas and projects. Being able to accomplish a project like The Enceladus Anomaly with all the quality that is required, without intermediaries, nor interferences in the work, neither unnecessary pressures that could harm the quality of the pages… it's an unthinkable luxury before. Dealing directly with the final client, the comic-book reader who is searching for quality works constantly, is a dream becoming true. An exciting journey that I hope to achieve with your help and your company. Also, one feels very lonely in the cold blackness of the space!  :)
 
 
 

 
As a comic-book author, the quality of my work is my main priority. Because of this, excluding the english translation and the printing, I take on personally all the creative aspects of this work (plot, designs, script, drawings, coloring, lettering, etc…) as well as the necessary logistics to carry out successfully this exciting project.
 

So that, with some of the first pages just finished, I consider essential to take in the whole 2016 year to complete all the work, being able to send away the books (along with the other items) to everyone during the early months of 2017.
Anyway, as living in the space is always risky and unpredictable, I'll try to keep the communication with all of you as fluid as possible, so you'll be able to be aware of any advance or delay that could arise during the ""mission"".   :)
The total quantity of money contributed to this campaign will go to the production, translation and printing of the comic-book, as well as all the extras like: postcards, bookmarks, posters, needlework badges, commissions, shipping materials, Indiegogo and PayPal commissions and fees, etc…


 
 

 
Se que muchos de vosotros estaréis de acuerdo conmigo en que estamos experimentando unas de las etapas más sorprendentes e interesantes de nuestra corta historia por este hermoso y vibrante planeta. Son tiempos llenos de cambios, de incertidumbres, de avances y retrocesos, pero sobre todo, de oportunidades. Internet, las redes sociales y, en especial, las plataformas de financiación colectiva, lo están cambiando todo. Están generado un nuevo paradigma, una nueva forma de hacer realidad nuestros proyectos e ideas más personales. Poder llevar a cabo un proyecto como La Anomalía de Encelado con toda la calidad que se requiere, sin intermediarios, sin injerencias en la obra ni presiones innecesarias que mermen la calidad de sus páginas, es un lujo antes impensable. Poder tratar directamente con el cliente final, el lector de cómics, que busca incesantemente trabajos de calidad, tanto en su concepción y diseño como en su realización final, es un sueño que se va haciendo realidad. Un viaje excitante que espero poder llevar a cabo con tu ayuda y compañía. ¡Además, uno se siente muy solo en la fría inmensidad del espacio!  :)
 


 

 
Como autor de cómics, la calidad de mi trabajo es mi mayor prioridad. Es por ello que, exceptuando la traducción al inglés y la impresión de los ejemplares, yo soy el único encargado de afrontar todos los aspectos creativos de esta obra (argumento, diseños, guión, dibujo, color, rotulación, etc…) y de controlar toda la logística necesaria para llevar a buen puerto este emocionante proyecto. Solo así puedo asegurarme de que el trabajo resultante será fiel a su concepción original. 
Así pues, y con algunas de las primeras páginas del cómic ya terminadas, sería indispensable abarcar todo el 2016 para la completa realización del trabajo,  pudiendo enviar el cómic impreso (junto con el resto de artículos) a cada uno de vosotros durante los primeros meses de 2017.
De todas formas, como la vida en el espacio es siempre arriesgada e imprevisible, trataré de mantener la comunicación con todos vosotros lo más fluida posible, y así podréis estar siempre al tanto de cualquier avance o retroceso que pudiera surgir durante la ""misión"".  :)
La cantidad total de dinero aportado a esta campaña irá destinado a la producción, traducción e impresión de la obra, así como a todo tipo de añadidos y extras, como postales, marcapáginas, pósters, insignias bordadas, commissions, material de envío, pago de las comisiones de Indiegogo y PayPal, etc…

<h3>The Listener</h3>
<p>Let's begin with the <i>Death of a man</i>...always a good way to tell a story, right? My great uncle Les died not long ago. He was a quiet man, but when he spoke, I listened. It was always worth it. Les talked about being a Native American soldier in WW2 frequently and the hardships he went through. There was no regret in his stories, there was, however, horror in his words. </p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1609697726/qv6akzoe1xhleymktxxm.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<p>There are a lot of stories that don't see the light of day. With <i>The Listener,</i> I'd like to bring to light numerous stories that we as people dismiss. From war stories to horrifying tales passed from individual to individual. <i>The Listener </i>follows Aditsan (or Adi as we'll refer to him going forward). Adi is a Native American soldier who'll be our primary protagonist. Many of Adi's experiences are ones that actually occurred to my uncle, as well as other vets. Alongside the factual events, I've woven a world of horror based around myths and religion. <i>What would it be like if the spiritual realm was literally only separated by a thin veil from the living? What if you woke up one day and could see the dead? Gods? Demons?</i> There's a bit of truth in every scary story you've heard throughout your life.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Every backer helps us get stories that are often brushed aside out to more people. Native American soldiers and their stories need to be told just like any other and we know people are Listening. If stories aren't told they fade away and Les's story needs to be told. We successfully met our goal for Book One on Kickstarter and have sold a substantial amount of copies. We want to invite you all into the world of The Listener, a world where someone is always Listening when you're alone in the dark.</p>

<p>Now, although this isn't my first comic book, <i>Band of Warriors</i> was the first that appeared in my head over 4 years ago when I started this <strong>crazy journey</strong>. My mother has a house on the <strong>island of Crete</strong> and when I visited there for the first time in 2016 I was <strong>enthralled</strong> by the history it had. Both fairly recently (WW2) and even further in the past, especially the bronze age (3,000-1200 BC).</p>
<p>That same year, I visited my wife's family in <strong>Brittany, France</strong>. Of course, I had visited them before but this time we visited a <strong>megalith</strong> that was next to an old tin mine. For those of you not in the know, <strong>bronze</strong> is made up of copper and, you guessed it... tin.</p>
<p>When <strong>investigating</strong> all of this further it turned out that bronze age tin from France and Britain (my own homeland) had been found among <strong>bronze age</strong> <strong>artefacts </strong>on and around Crete. This trading relationship between France, Britain and Crete that was happening in the bronze age got my <strong>imagination fired up</strong> and the idea of <i>Band of Warriors</i> began.</p>
<p>I'm going to be honest, it hasn't been easy trawling through all the <strong>history and mythology</strong> surrounding all of those regions to create a coherent story but I think (if I don't say so myself) I've created a <strong>rather epic story</strong> that begins by following King Minos at the height of his reign at the palace of Knossos, on the island of Crete.</p>

<p>To get you started, below are <strong>5 pages</strong> from the first issue. And if you enjoy them, it's with pleasure to invite you to write to our <strong>letters page</strong> that will be published in each issue, aptly titled <i><strong>Fans of Warriors</strong></i>.

<p>Following on from those pages you probably noticed that we <strong>censored</strong> a few bits out. This is because we've tried to be as <strong>historically accurate</strong> as possible, and at that time and place both men and women were <strong>mostly bare-chested</strong>, which you can see below in the form of some Minoan statues as well as from this enlightening <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing_in_the_ancient_world#Ancient_Minoan_clothing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self"">Wikipedia article</a>. However, just so you know, <strong>when we publish</strong> and send out the comic, obviously there <strong>won't be any censorship</strong> on the art. What I'm also trying to get at is that this is a comic for <strong>mature readers</strong>, as it features mild nudity, strong violence and sexual references.</p>

<p>Moving on from that clarification, I'd like to introduce you to some of the <strong>main characters</strong> of the story; King Minos (leader of the Minoans of Knossos), Prince Giorgos (King Minos' son), King Agamemnon (leader of the Mycenaeans) and Theseus (a tribute sent to King Minos from Athens)... </p>

</div></div>","What's Band of Warriors about?
Around 1,500 BC one of the most catastrophic volcanic eruptions in human history occurred just off the coast of Crete on the island of Santorini. Known as the Minoan Eruption, it caused absolute devastation in the immediate area and set the stage for the Late Bronze Age collapse.
Merging actual historical events with Celtic and Greek mythology, Band of Warriors is an epic tale of adventure, betrayal and vengeance that begins by following King Minos at the height of his reign, in the palace of Knossos, on the island of Crete. Where it will lead, only the Gods know...

Who will enjoy Band of Warriors?


Fans of epic action/adventure comics.
If you like the idea of a comic that merges Celtic and Greek mythology.
Readers of comics such as 300, Birthright, Green Valley, Kill the Minotaur and Vikings.
Collectors of high quality independent comics for mature readers. (Contains mild nudity, strong violence and sexual references.)


What do Band of Warriors backers get?

All reward backers receive a 28 page digital copy of Band of Warriors. Plus a PDF of the original script and a creation commentary video by Samuel George London.
All physical reward backers receive a 28 page, staple bound, US standard size comic with the option for either economy (30 days) or express (7 days) delivery.
Above the print copy reward level you can also get a Band of Warriors enamel pin based on an actual historical artefact from 1,500 BC known as The Ring of Theseus.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Brandon Kitchen. I've been writing this story for a couple years. It's a comic book about a superhero all based on the Gods and Goddesses of Olympus! The protagonist is a simple man, a little out of shape who gets into a horrific car accident and nearly dies only to wake up and realizes he has the powers of the God of Gods, Zeus! The protagonist gets powers too from Hades but his come with a twist! I'm incredibly excited about the possibilities and the ideas I have floating around in my nugget. Just so we're clear and potential contributors know I'm not blowing smoke, I do have an issue and a half written and have since started writing more frequently. If you're unsure about it and want to know more my email is bkitchen@sbcglobal.net. contact me there with any comments, questions, or concerns.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Judging by who ive spoken to and what ive gathered is I will need at least $300 to get just the logo and a couple sketches of some concept art for the protagonist and if someone is generous enough, the antagonist as well</p>
<p>       Any proceeds received from this campaign will go directly to paying an artist to render concept drawings and logo ideas</p>
<ul>
<li>I have the creativity, the tenacity and the drive to get this written and it will be my absolute best effort. I come from a music background and I was stalling there so I chose to redirect that creative effort towards something that can not only reach more people but also be more intriguing. </li>
<li>If I do not come up with enough to come up with at least a logo I will redistribute funds back to contributors and the ones who do not want to receive that money back will be donated to publicly chosen cause. However, I will not stop writing or trying to come up with the money myself</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Now, let's get into some of those ideas I have. The protagonist not only receives the powers of Zeus but what he doesn't know is that he's being trained to replace him, via a transference of consciousness. hey, even gods need breaks. The antagonist doesn't know he's an antagonist. He is the son of hades as well, Hades found a way to pass through the trap door he kidnapped Persephone from. I'm sure I don't have to explain where babies come from haha. Hades tricks his ""demi-devil"" son as I elected to call it, that he's meant to be a superhero. He's been given these gifts to punish the wicked of the world. Little does he know he's only feeding his father more souls. Eventually the more he unbeknownst to him uses his powers for evil it slowly corrupts him...making him gradually the antagonist to this story.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is incredibly important to me how this pans out. I want this to be something special and I know any potential contributors will want the same thing.</li>
<li>This is my very first project like this but I wouldn't waste my time or yours to set this up if I didn't feel like I was making any headway on.</li>
<li>I will provide updates and progress reports via email or facebook if you have me on there. if not. feel free to add me.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I also feel I need to be transparent. As I've stated, this is my very first project of this kind and I need potential contributors to know what I'm after.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the hurdles I will run into is finding an artist who believes in this project as much as I, and my potential contributors do.</li>
<li>I plan to overcome this by stronger networking and persistence</li>
</ul>

<p>I cannot stress this enough. Do not hesitate to share this campaign even if you cant contribute. The more people this reaches could potentially be worth more than the funds raised.</p>

<p>Additionally:</p>

The Veuniverse is a strange location full of daft and dangerous denizens. This place isn't always the friendliest, so it takes a particular type of brave buffoon to be a courier, especially when there are equally rash rival couriers competing for the same jobs!Join the pompadour-styled Raimundo and his witty cohorts Bloob & Melody (the One Dimensional Couriers) in a race against time to deliver what could be the biggest package of their careers-- all in service of a quizzically questionable client!If you're a fan of dynamic, action-based anime and random humor from down under, you can't go wrong with RandomVeus ODC!
 
Behind the Book:
Jeffrey “Chamba” Cruz is a wildly kinetic Australian artist best-known for his work on the Street Fighter comics. Chamba has also illustrated for properties such as Marvel’s Venom, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Mega Man, Power Rangers, Big Trouble in Little China, and Tatsunoko VS Capcom.
UDON Entertainment is a publisher of art books, comic books, and manga. Some of our best-known projects showcase video game and anime properties such as Street Fighter, Mega Man, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Dark Souls, Gears of War, Monster Hunter, and many more. In 2020 we are celebrating the studio’s 20th anniversary.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">A remote mountain town that has been terrorized by a serial killer who murders the parents of children while they sleep.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Hornfeather is a dark supernatural thriller. It has the sensibility of a small town murder mystery, mixed with an 80’s cult horror film aesthetic.

Plus another $200 for the cover makes it an even $5000. As I mentioned above I also have veteran letterer Patrick Brosseau on board for this project.

I'm Dennis Mallonee, the president of HEROIC PUBLISHING. For more than three decades, starting in the mid-1980s, I've published a line of superhero comic books featuring awesome characters such as Flare, Liberty Girl, the League of Champions, WitchGirls Inc, and the Sensational G-Girl. Heroic Publishing's breakout, show-stopping character was (and remains) FLARE, the superhero supermodel, a sexy shining goddess of light.The ever expanding Heroic multiverse has an amazing line-up of heroes, from Eternity Smith to the Huntsman, but our fans have always favored our beautiful and powerful women, whether as antagonist, protagonist, superheroine or supervillainess. Long before it became politically popular, the Heroic multiverse was home to a wide spectrum of the human family, including gods and other-dimensional creatures!But always it was THE SUPERWOMEN who led the way. And now, as we near 40 years of fantastic adventures, it's time to pay tribute to those wonderful characters with a beautiful hardbound coffee table book of pin ups.And the largest portion of the net proceeds from this project, fully 80%, will be earmarked specifically for the artists and for a worthy charity!Here are the details:Ulderico Fioretti is the producer and designer of the project. He has given the book a beautiful, elegant design style.

 ""HEROIC PUBLISHING: THE SUPERWOMEN"" is a pin-up art book that will be created specifically to try to help artists who have been impacted not only by the current global pandemic, but by other diseases around the world. We're also looking to raise funds for Médecins Sans Frontières (www.msf.org) through the sale of this art book.And that's why we want your help with this project. But we don't stop there, because a smaller part of the proceeds will go to help Heroic Publishing ramp up production of new comic books and art books. This particular art book will be entirely dedicated to the Heroic Publishing's superheroines (and supervillainesses). We're going to blow your mind with this gorgeous collectors edition!Next, we reached out to some of the most talented artists in the world with this idea:an art book of female characters to help raise money for a worthy charity, and specifically for artists having difficulty with health issues.We have been blessed and inspired by the support and the generosity of spirit we've received from our line up of amazing artists:Tanino LiberatoreAriel OlivettiEduardo RissoMark BeachumOnofrio Catacchio Kyu Yong EomEmanuele Taglietti Don WalkerAlessandro Scacchia Paul AbramsUlderico FiorettiDaerick Gross SrBRÄOPaolo MassagliAndrew Pepoy Giancarlo Caracuzzo Beniamino Del VecchioBenito GallegoConny Valentina Uko Smith Antonio De Luca Andy SmithStefania Macera The art book will also feature FOREWORDS by Roy Thomas, Steve Perrin, and Dennis Mallonee.
 CAMPAIGN OBJECTIVESRaise a total of $17,000 to cover the cost of producing and printing1000 units of a Hardcover premium limited edition art bookEvery dollar above that will go 
50% to the participating artists, specifically to help those who need help dealing with problems arising from the current global pandemic
30% to Médecins sans frontières, an extremely worthy charitable organization
20% to Heroic Publishing to support future projects
 Why Médecins Sans Frontières?Because it is an association that goes where it is needed. During this pandemic they are in Europe, Brazil, Africa, Syria, and other countries with great difficulties. And even after this is over, they will be in the front line! The Time FrameMany of our participating artists are already working on their contributions.

<p>Hi, my name is Ian Eyre. I've been working in entertainment since college. For the last twenty-five years I’ve worked in special effects and stunts for pay, and studied screenwriting, producing and directing as a dream. As you can see in my <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHSRAw7OiBM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Stunt Performing Reel</a>, I put a lot of heart and soul into pounding the ground. And as you can see from my award-winning short film <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgnPfxkb60A&amp;t=137s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">“Run Cholo Run”</a>, I want to tell high-octane, human stories. I'm putting that same passion and creativity into my comics and movies. Click here for <a href=""http://%E2%80%8B%20http://eepurl.com/c9SuS9"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Eyre Films Newsletter</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Comic</strong></p>
<p>To prove an audience for the the exciting world of SMASH AND RUN,  I decided to start sharing the story through a comic book. Unfortunately, my amazing artist <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/screenpen/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Alan Reyes</a> had to take a break. I've assembled a new team to help me complete the comic and we're taking pre-orders on the first issue. We need funds to pay the artists, marketing and print costs, Indiegogo fees, taxes, etc. You're going to want to run, jump and Parkour to get your own comic!</p>
<p>          <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509562178/cjhjhhx4o9yzreu5wawt.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Smash and Run the comic series will tell the back stories of some of the characters in the movie. The first issue will be called SMASH AND RUN: CHOOSING SIDES, because since it will be the first published exposure to the world, you the audience won’t necessarily know who's good and who’s bad. Actually, the hero just runs and flips through life and hasn’t decided yet which side to take. Whose side do you choose?</p>
<p><strong>The Hero</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509517371/llt57foh3j4hphedcpc1.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our hero is called Flacco by his mom because he’s so skinny. He prefers to be called Falco because he dreams of flying like a falcon. He trains in the art of Parkour a.k.a. Freerunning in order to experience the freedom of flight, but also to face and overcome his fear of heights. If only he could stay focused and commit to each jump without getting distracted by girls. When his family storefront is robbed by smash-and-grab robbers, he decides that he wants in on the action - the chase. If the cops can’t catch ‘em, and he can’t  join ‘em, maybe he can beat ‘em.</p>
<p><strong>So, what is Freerunning a.k.a. Parkour?</strong></p>
<p>First, a quick recap of what's so awesome about the growing sport. </p>

<div>Freerunning isn't just for superheroes, there's something for all ages and abilities. It's a great workout, it forces you to push your own boundaries, it inspires confidence in life, and it keeps you feeling young. You're going to want to jump into the world of SMASH AND RUN.</div>

<p><strong>The Movie</strong></p>
<p>Ian wrote a movie that we're really excited about called SMASH AND RUN, which is basically Fast and Furious on foot with teenager crime-fighters. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">          <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509562433/asfbsk9ilx5lkr1kmq3j.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>SMASH AND RUN is a father/son story set inside a diamond heist-story, located in multi-cultural Koreatown near downtown Los Angeles, with lots of original Freerunning action scenes. The teenager doesn't much respect his mom's new husband because he has no idea of the sacrifice the father-figure made out of love for his mom. So, he keeps pushing boundaries and tying to prove himself, just like we all do, right? But in his case, that means chasing down robbers himself instead of letting the cops do it.</p>

<p><strong>The Promise</strong></p>
<p>We're on schedule to deliver the first B&amp;W issue of Smash and Run comics in time to give as a Christmas gift. If there's a delay in printing and you really want it by a certain date, let us know and we'll custom print a short order. We've also created some other exclusive perks to reward your support. This comic book is the start of something huge - perhaps one day a major motion picture franchise. Will you help us keep the dream alive?</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Initial Goal: $7000 to finish the comic in Color and print 500 copies.</p>
<p>Stretch Goal: we will keep the momentum going with new issues.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508371353/e3o56fzwpcpt5s38nve0.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Ian is currently paying for this comic book by trading professional skills with other professionals. This is a slow way of spending sweat equity while also paying the bills.</p>
<p>It costs about $100 for a professional artist to draw a page, $50 to color it and $15 to hand letter it. I have chosen <a href=""http://audraesch.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Audra Esch</a> to complete drawing Comic #1 because she's so talented and she loves Parkour. The first artist <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/screenpen/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Alan Reyes</a> is super talented as well, but had to take a break. I've also partnered with American Parkour Ambassador <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAWIUfx8JeU"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jay James</a> to bring the comic to the Freerunning world. Then, logistically, Indiegogo requires 8% for their services and credit card handling. And we still need to create, package and deliver the products, and pay our taxes.​</p>
<p>We’re dreaming up ways to give back to the community through various youth programs such as <a href=""http://thegrafflab.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Graff Lab</a>.</p>
<p>The fun thing about starting small is including you fans. Y'all can offer positive suggestions and we can incorporate them into the story and the process. See the Comments section.</p>
<p>BTW, if we don't raise $7000 we get nothing, so we're ""all in"" to provide you the best comic possible.</p>
<p><strong>The Rewards and Perks (choose confirmed perks on the right):</strong></p>
<p>Please note: The t-shirt options have a choice for adult sizes and child sizes. Obviously, a shirt can't be both. Please simply leave a comment to clarify your choice.</p>

<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Why make another comic book? Well, it's more fun than reading a book with no pictures right? And there are not too many comics showcasing the fast-growing sport of Freerunning. All the kids are doing it. <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/for-teacher-parkour-rekindles-our-instinct-to-move/2017/10/17/ecf632ec-9e20-11e7-8ea1-ed975285475e_story.html?utm_term=.99a1fde1a51c"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">All the middle schools in Washington, D.C. are teaching it.</a> My eleven-year-old son is wall-climbing my house and jumping off my roof, for crying out loud. And SMASH AND RUN is a story where the kids outperform the grownups. That serves a need, not a desire, right parents? </p>
<p>I don't have a track record making popular movies or comics, but I think my interests overlap with the interests of millions of people, and that what excites me will excite you. And I think the execution in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/EyreFilms"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my reels and short films</a> show that I deliver at a high quality. I'm hiring the right professionals to take what I've started to the next level, and your mailbox.</p>
<p>Making a feature film is like eating a macdaddy elephant - it must be broken into many bite-sized morsels. Writing a good screenplay is like eating a smaller elephant. While rewriting the feature screenplay, I wrote a short script to prove the concept and build fans, but the cost and logistics were still daunting. So, why not a comic book? Not that I want to think about eating a baby elephant. </p>

Short Summary

Hi, my name is Ian Eyre. I've been working in entertainment since college. For the last twenty-five years I’ve worked in special effects and stunts for pay, and studied screenwriting, producing and directing as a dream. As you can see in my Stunt Performing Reel, I put a lot of heart and soul into pounding the ground. And as you can see from my award-winning short film “Run Cholo Run”, I want to tell high-octane, human stories. I'm putting that same passion and creativity into my comics and movies. Click here for Eyre Films Newsletter.
The Comic
To prove an audience for the the exciting world of SMASH AND RUN,  I decided to start sharing the story through a comic book. Unfortunately, my amazing artist Alan Reyes had to take a break. I've assembled a new team to help me complete the comic and we're taking pre-orders on the first issue. We need funds to pay the artists, marketing and print costs, Indiegogo fees, taxes, etc. You're going to want to run, jump and Parkour to get your own comic!
          


Smash and Run the comic series will tell the back stories of some of the characters in the movie. The first issue will be called SMASH AND RUN: CHOOSING SIDES, because since it will be the first published exposure to the world, you the audience won’t necessarily know who's good and who’s bad. Actually, the hero just runs and flips through life and hasn’t decided yet which side to take. Whose side do you choose?
The Hero

Our hero is called Flacco by his mom because he’s so skinny. He prefers to be called Falco because he dreams of flying like a falcon. He trains in the art of Parkour a.k.a. Freerunning in order to experience the freedom of flight, but also to face and overcome his fear of heights. If only he could stay focused and commit to each jump without getting distracted by girls. When his family storefront is robbed by smash-and-grab robbers, he decides that he wants in on the action - the chase. If the cops can’t catch ‘em, and he can’t  join ‘em, maybe he can beat ‘em.
So, what is Freerunning a.k.a. Parkour?
First, a quick recap of what's so awesome about the growing sport. 

And this guy explains the difference: 

\
 
Freerunning isn't just for superheroes, there's something for all ages and abilities. It's a great workout, it forces you to push your own boundaries, it inspires confidence in life, and it keeps you feeling young. You're going to want to jump into the world of SMASH AND RUN.
 
The Movie
Ian wrote a movie that we're really excited about called SMASH AND RUN, which is basically Fast and Furious on foot with teenager crime-fighters. 
          
SMASH AND RUN is a father/son story set inside a diamond heist-story, located in multi-cultural Koreatown near downtown Los Angeles, with lots of original Freerunning action scenes. The teenager doesn't much respect his mom's new husband because he has no idea of the sacrifice the father-figure made out of love for his mom. So, he keeps pushing boundaries and tying to prove himself, just like we all do, right? But in his case, that means chasing down robbers himself instead of letting the cops do it.
 
The Crowdfund Campaign

We're launching a sixty day campaign, through the months of November and December, to raise funds to finish the comic book. We intend to deliver our updated, original, 20 page B&W Comic #1 in December so you can give it as gifts in time for Christmas. Then in January, once the funds get released by Indiegogo, we will get busy coloring Comic #1 and drawing Comic #2. 
The Team 

 
IAN EYRE

Ian Eyre is a writer, director, stunt coordinator who hails from Toronto via Atlanta and settled in Los Angeles with his wife and two pre-teen, Parkour-loving children. His work can be seen at Eyre Films, YouTube and IMDb.

 
JAY JAMES
 
Jay, is a professional martial artist and traceur (Parkour athlete) from Cary North Carolina, who is an American Parkour Ambassador and the founder of Rahyz Cary Fitness, a traveling martial arts and Parkour family. Jay has been involved and training in the Parkour community for over 8 years through teaching, competing, performance, acting, and stunt work. See Jay's video here.

 
 
 
 
AUDRA ESCH
 

Awwdraws /ah-drahs/ noun 1. One who sketches cute or “aww” inducing subjects, particularly persons that go by the name Audra Esch.
Audra has been working in the film and television industry for 12+ years as a storyboard artist. She has a wide range of experience from live action to cg animation with a background in fine art painting in portraiture and landscapes. She loves to work in a range of styles from realistic to cartoony and cute. Currently she is obsessed with painting mermaids. Her tools of the trade include the iPad Pro, various drawing and design apps, a range of red pencils, gouache, watercolor and oil. Audra is a spectacular artist from Phoenix, AZ. See her amazing Paintings and Illustrations. 

 
The Promise
We're on schedule to deliver the first B&W issue of Smash and Run comics in time to give as a Christmas gift. If there's a delay in printing and you really want it by a certain date, let us know and we'll custom print a short order. We've also created some other exclusive perks to reward your support. This comic book is the start of something huge - perhaps one day a major motion picture franchise. Will you help us keep the dream alive?
 
What We Need & What You Get
Initial Goal: $7000 to finish the comic in Color and print 500 copies.
Stretch Goal: we will keep the momentum going with new issues.

Ian is currently paying for this comic book by trading professional skills with other professionals. This is a slow way of spending sweat equity while also paying the bills.
It costs about $100 for a professional artist to draw a page, $50 to color it and $15 to hand letter it. I have chosen Audra Esch to complete drawing Comic #1 because she's so talented and she loves Parkour. The first artist Alan Reyes is super talented as well, but had to take a break. I've also partnered with American Parkour Ambassador Jay James to bring the comic to the Freerunning world. Then, logistically, Indiegogo requires 8% for their services and credit card handling. And we still need to create, package and deliver the products, and pay our taxes.​
We’re dreaming up ways to give back to the community through various youth programs such as The Graff Lab.
The fun thing about starting small is including you fans. Y'all can offer positive suggestions and we can incorporate them into the story and the process. See the Comments section.
BTW, if we don't raise $7000 we get nothing, so we're ""all in"" to provide you the best comic possible.
The Rewards and Perks (choose confirmed perks on the right):
Please note: The t-shirt options have a choice for adult sizes and child sizes. Obviously, a shirt can't be both. Please simply leave a comment to clarify your choice.

Sorry for the high shipping costs. Those are based on USPS rates. I will continue to research less expensive options. If you're in the social circles of any of the team, you may pick your perk up directly. Or come to the Comic Release Jam in Los Angeles, date TBD in January.
Potential Future Perks - Tell us what you want:
GRAVITY FREE $TBD // LIMITED TO 5
Personal Parkour training session (2 hours) with Jay James in Los Angeles, Date TBD
GROUND POUNDER $TBD // LIMITED TO 5
Personal Stunt training session (2 hours) with Ian Eyre in Los Angeles, Date TBD
COMIC RELEASE JAM $TBD // LIMITED TO 3
​One ticket to the Comic Release Jam in Los Angeles, TBD.

JAM OR BUST $TBD // LIMITED TO 3
​VIP treatment at a Comic Release Jam in Los Angeles. Help design and build an obstacle course with Jay James (and get some coaching as well).
POINT OF NO RETURN $??? 
Make a request. Dream without fear. If you believe in our cause and want to encourage us, make any amount of donation and suggest the perks or rewards you would like. We will create a custom experience for you.
Stretch Goal #1
Comic #2, of course!.
The Impact
Making a living in entertainment is challenging, especially paying the bills in Los Angeles. Creating something of value and delivering it takes risk and perseverance. We’re starting small but dreaming big. As we figure out what you our audience are interested in we will provide options for you to immerse yourself into the world of Smash and Run. This is our first comic book, but it’s just a different medium of storytelling. The award winning “Run Cholo Run” is an example of the quality of product we strive for, complete with original music and artwork. We covet your input, what you like, what you dislike, and what kinds of characters and stories you’d like to see represented.
Eyre Films, LLC is committed to impacting the community as well as the bottom line. Eyre Films, LLC will always give 10% to charities that make the world more beautiful, such as Mosaic LA, a community of faith, love and hope that does the most good locally and worldwide with what it’s entrusted with, and the Act One Program, which trains up storytellers to use the power of entertainment to impact culture positively. The Smash and Run project will also donate 10% of its profits (after we deliver the comic and perks) to youth programs such as American Parkour and The Graff Lab.

Risks & Challenges
Why make another comic book? Well, it's more fun than reading a book with no pictures right? And there are not too many comics showcasing the fast-growing sport of Freerunning. All the kids are doing it. All the middle schools in Washington, D.C. are teaching it. My eleven-year-old son is wall-climbing my house and jumping off my roof, for crying out loud. And SMASH AND RUN is a story where the kids outperform the grownups. That serves a need, not a desire, right parents? 
I don't have a track record making popular movies or comics, but I think my interests overlap with the interests of millions of people, and that what excites me will excite you. And I think the execution in my reels and short films show that I deliver at a high quality. I'm hiring the right professionals to take what I've started to the next level, and your mailbox.
Making a feature film is like eating a macdaddy elephant - it must be broken into many bite-sized morsels. Writing a good screenplay is like eating a smaller elephant. While rewriting the feature screenplay, I wrote a short script to prove the concept and build fans, but the cost and logistics were still daunting. So, why not a comic book? Not that I want to think about eating a baby elephant.

<h2><strong>The Campaign:</strong></h2>
<p>I am launching this campaign to raise the funds necessary to bring <strong>Gully &amp; Finch</strong> to life in a full-color, physical volume. I have personally funded the project to this point and have a No. 1 best-selling black &amp; white digital copy to show for our efforts. All that is left to do is color and print!</p>
<p>The <strong>Gully &amp; Finch</strong> <strong>Comic</strong> is based on a lighthearted Television Series and a shorter form web series I am currently pitching to networks and production companies. We had originally planned to start shooting the proof of concept for the web series this past summer, but due to the state of things in our current environment with Covid19, production has been halted until it is safe for the cast &amp; crew to continue. Please feel free to visit the web series website<strong> <a href=""http://www.gullyandfinch.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gully &amp; Finch</a> </strong>at your leisure, for more on the series or to follow our production schedule.</p>
<p>The black &amp; white version of the comic is available on Amazon (Kindle Select) and went No. 1 in its category within 5 days of its release, through a major push on Social Media. The Community really showed their belief and support of our comedic duo -- thank you! I have been beyond humbled by everyone's generosity towards this project. We are adding a couple of special bonuses to the B&amp;W digital perk!</p>
<p>With your help, we release the full-color of <strong>Gully &amp; Finch!</strong></p>

<h2>What We Need:</h2>
<p>The following is what we would like to raise through the campaign:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our goal is to raise $12,500.00.</li>
<li>We do have some really creative stretch goals coming up! (TBA alongside updates as we near our target goal).</li>
<li>It is our aim to off-set color and printing costs for both the B&amp;W and Full-Color volume (We are already underway!)</li>
<li>The remainder will cover publishing and distribution of the actual comic book, along with the cost associated with fulfilling our Perks.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>My Commitment:</h2>
<p>The Gully &amp; Finch Universe was inspired by my little bro and some truly funny real-life scenarios. This entire endeavor is dedicated to him!</p>

We are psyched you have taken a moment to learn more.
If you're a fan of Detective or Buddy Comics, these two amateur sleuths are sure to keep you entertained with their mishaps and misadventures!
We are raising funds to offset the cost of coloring the Full-Color volume and to print and publish both the 24-page B&W and Full-Color volumes of Gully & Finch Volume 1: The Bachelorette Comic. We have already begun the process and are eager to send the full-color comic out into the world! The B&W digital version went No. 1 within days of being self-published in its category.
We hope you'll read further to see how you can help with this part of the process! We are grateful for any support you may be able to contribute. We realize that not everyone can help fund the project, but there are other ways you can help support our series. Just sharing the campaign with others through FB, Twitter, IG, Reddit, and the like would be a tremendous help! Be sure to use the Indiegogo share tools!

 
The Creators:
My name is Tonia Kempler. I am a Filmmaker/Screenwriter/Author. My recent accomplishments include multi-award-winning short films and numerous screenwriting accolades. Comics have always been a special passion! Please feel free to visit my websites for more information: writing4em or B3E Entertainment.
I partnered with Norbert Yates, an incredible illustrator, who brought my pages to life. It was an incredible experience to watch my script come together through another's artistic vision. I am both honored to have met him and humbled by his talent. I could not have done this without him. In short, Norbert ROCKS! And together we are going to rock out many more bungled cases for Gully Jessup and Finch Watson!
 

 
 
The Campaign:
I am launching this campaign to raise the funds necessary to bring Gully & Finch to life in a full-color, physical volume. I have personally funded the project to this point and have a No. 1 best-selling black & white digital copy to show for our efforts. All that is left to do is color and print!
The Gully & Finch Comic is based on a lighthearted Television Series and a shorter form web series I am currently pitching to networks and production companies. We had originally planned to start shooting the proof of concept for the web series this past summer, but due to the state of things in our current environment with Covid19, production has been halted until it is safe for the cast & crew to continue. Please feel free to visit the web series website Gully & Finch at your leisure, for more on the series or to follow our production schedule.
The black & white version of the comic is available on Amazon (Kindle Select) and went No. 1 in its category within 5 days of its release, through a major push on Social Media. The Community really showed their belief and support of our comedic duo -- thank you! I have been beyond humbled by everyone's generosity towards this project. We are adding a couple of special bonuses to the B&W digital perk!
With your help, we release the full-color of Gully & Finch!

 
 
The Series:
Gully & Finch is a Comedy/Buddy/Detective Series  about two twenty-somethings, stuck in failure-to-launch mode who pass themselves off as private investigators and start tackling cases they are not cut out for, landing them both in a heap of trouble.  They're a 21st Century Hardy Boys meets Veronica Mars & beloved classic detective icons: Magnum, Sherlock, Jim Rockford, and more!
 




 
 
What We Need:
The following is what we would like to raise through the campaign:

Our goal is to raise $12,500.00.
We do have some really creative stretch goals coming up! (TBA alongside updates as we near our target goal).
It is our aim to off-set color and printing costs for both the B&W and Full-Color volume (We are already underway!)
The remainder will cover publishing and distribution of the actual comic book, along with the cost associated with fulfilling our Perks.

 
My Commitment:
The Gully & Finch Universe was inspired by my little bro and some truly funny real-life scenarios. This entire endeavor is dedicated to him!

I will absolutely complete this project even if we don't reach our entire goal. It will just take a little longer without investors.
We will ship copies of the book (and all merchandise) timely but may have to work around the printing facility's schedule due to any unforeseen circumstances that could arise due to Covid19. Information will be timely with precise details.
I will keep the updates on this project coming and I promise to make them fun!

 
 

 
 
A Few of the Perks:

Both the B&W and Full-Color versions of Volume 1: The Bachelorette will be an available perk.
We'll feature a few investors as Illustrated Character Cameos in the comic (limited perk). This perk also makes a perfect surprise gift! A character will be crafted from a photo of the investor's choice.
We will be offering a Creative Q&A  Session with the Creator of the series via Zoom.
Join in on a brainstorming session for Volume 2 with the Creator and additional writers.
Fun Merchandise and varient covers will be available as stretch goals and MORE!

Stretch GoalsWhile we have no definite stretch goals, excess money will go towards funding further issues of Midnight Widows.
Risks & ChallengesThe team behind Midnight Widows have varying degrees of experience in the field, and a number of factors involved in its completion will be new to us. There is always the chance that things might go wrong, particularly when it comes to printing and distributing physical copies of the comic. However, in the event of delays or other problems, we will strive to keep in touch with every backer affected and ensure that they go away satisfied with their experience.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Red Talon was a dream created many years ago, around 2003-2005 . At first he was called Black Talon and he was actually created by my father, Ken Keller II. I am Ken Keller III and the writer, story-teller and co-creator of the Red Talon universe along with my father. We created Flat World Comics all the way back then but never made it a reality. I spent many years trying to convert our comic book idea into a teen novel; in fact I wrote the novel twice. In the end when I was 23 I decided that the story would be best seen as it was always intended: as a action packed comic book with an original story.</p>
<p>That's what we delivered with Red Talon issue 1 and quickly caught the eye of Publisher Star Cross Comics ran by Joe Spencer. Now Red Talon's universe has collided with Star Cross for an even wider and more thrilling universe: think Christian Marvel or DC in the making.

<p>Operation Eclipse is the story of a man who has grown tired of the crime in his city.  After the murder of his fiance and with the training from a former Army special forces veteran, Eclipse will fight to bring down the criminals and villains of St. Louis.</p>
<p><br/>Ray Marek began working on Operation Eclipse back in 2007.  When he began, it started as a joke at a wedding. The idea stuck with him over time, Ray began writing scripts and reworking the characters and story concepts. Soon it became a fully realized comic project and Ray began working on bringing Eclipse to life. There were many artists previously attached to this project and Ray had many obstacles to overcome in order to get this book published. And after successfully funding on Kickstarter all production expenses have been covered for issues 1 &amp; 2. Issue 1 is printed and in stock while issue 2 is in art production and expected to go to print by February. All money raised thru this campaign will strictly go to printing and production costs of the items pledged for and for the shipping costs of sending the rewards to our backers.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>New to Indiegogo!</strong></h3>
<p>It was brought to our attention that there are separate crowds for Kickstarter &amp; Indiegogo and we received many requests to bring this comic to Indiegogo for the good people who prefer this platform. So we are doing just that and are also offering various different reward options that will be exclusive to Indiegogo, items that were not offered thru Kickstarter and can't be found anywhere else! We have an Indiegogo exclusive variant cover as well as two exclusive Tshirts, 2 exclusive pinups, an exclusive diecut sticker and we are offering a hoodie for the very first time!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">In case you missed out on issue 1 we're offering copies of that as well. The first issue drops you right into the action as the unbalanced and terrifyingly insane Shiver holds the Mayor of St. Louis in a dark warehouse. Shiver has him tied to a chair, next to a table of knives. When Eclipse gets word of the kidnapping, he springs in to action to help the Mayor. The only problem, he doesn't know what lurks in the shadows of the warehouse. </span></p> <p>Issue two picks up with Eclipse fighting off a couple of masked men down by the St. Louis Arch. In the distance we can see someone watching Eclipse take on these masked men. But who is it? In this issue we learn a little more about Eclipse, what drives him and why he is fighting for his city. The cover gives us a look at an all new character ""Stinger"". But who is ""Stinger""? Back Operation Eclipse #2 to find out!</p>

</div></div>","Operation Eclipse is the story of a man who has grown tired of the crime in his city.  After the murder of his fiance and with the training from a former Army special forces veteran, Eclipse will fight to bring down the criminals and villains of St. Louis.
Ray Marek began working on Operation Eclipse back in 2007.  When he began, it started as a joke at a wedding. The idea stuck with him over time, Ray began writing scripts and reworking the characters and story concepts. Soon it became a fully realized comic project and Ray began working on bringing Eclipse to life. There were many artists previously attached to this project and Ray had many obstacles to overcome in order to get this book published. And after successfully funding on Kickstarter all production expenses have been covered for issues 1 & 2. Issue 1 is printed and in stock while issue 2 is in art production and expected to go to print by February. All money raised thru this campaign will strictly go to printing and production costs of the items pledged for and for the shipping costs of sending the rewards to our backers.
 
New to Indiegogo!
It was brought to our attention that there are separate crowds for Kickstarter & Indiegogo and we received many requests to bring this comic to Indiegogo for the good people who prefer this platform. So we are doing just that and are also offering various different reward options that will be exclusive to Indiegogo, items that were not offered thru Kickstarter and can't be found anywhere else! We have an Indiegogo exclusive variant cover as well as two exclusive Tshirts, 2 exclusive pinups, an exclusive diecut sticker and we are offering a hoodie for the very first time!
 
In case you missed out on issue 1 we're offering copies of that as well. The first issue drops you right into the action as the unbalanced and terrifyingly insane Shiver holds the Mayor of St. Louis in a dark warehouse. Shiver has him tied to a chair, next to a table of knives. When Eclipse gets word of the kidnapping, he springs in to action to help the Mayor. The only problem, he doesn't know what lurks in the shadows of the warehouse.  Issue two picks up with Eclipse fighting off a couple of masked men down by the St. Louis Arch. In the distance we can see someone watching Eclipse take on these masked men. But who is it? In this issue we learn a little more about Eclipse, what drives him and why he is fighting for his city. The cover gives us a look at an all new character ""Stinger"". But who is ""Stinger""? Back Operation Eclipse #2 to find out!

 

Issue #2 preview pages



 
Operation Eclipse issues are 22 pages of full color action.

<h2>What is DARK DARKNESS?</h2>
<p>Three super natural misfits and a nerd vie for the highest honor of darkest dark lord at a comic con of darkness (and all of the powers that come with the title). But before the winner can be chosen, a grisly murder catapults them on a quest to clear their names. In the process they unveil a plot that puts all the Darkness attendees in peril. Will one of them betray the others to rule as darkest dark lord, or will they work together and save the world from eternal darkness?</p>
<h3><strong>Why a Graphic Novel?</strong></h3>
<p>Dark Darkness started as a serial stage play that morphed into a web series. Having had a little taste of power, the web series mutated into a feature film screenplay in search of Tony Stark-esque to back the movie. Since Tony is hard to get a hold of right now, Dark Darkness dawned the cape of graphic novel, a perfect way to tell this epic fantasy comedy adventure story.</p>
<h3>What you get.</h3>
<p>We're offering a full color graphic novel between 120 and 134 pages (depending on the final layouts and bonus content) adapted from our 117 page film screenplay. For those that like to get more involved, we've got lots of extras for you too. If we make our goal, we'll also be able to offer stretch goals to backers.. Anyone that chooses a reward for more than $50 will get their name in the back of the book on a ""Thank You"" page next to the credits.</p>

<h3><strong>Our team!</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The story and principle characters of Dark Darkness were created by award winning playwright Ben Eisner. Filmmaker Wilson Large is the writer and has been the driving force behind this story for the last ten years. This process has included and been influenced by dozens of professional creatives from a broad spectrum of talents.</li>
<li>Ben Hansen is doing the linework for the graphic novel. Besides creating character designs, concept art and two posters for Dark Darkness, his artwork is featured in ""<i>Transformers Legends</i>"" mobile app game (NGMOCO Games), ""<i>Zombies Vs Cheerleaders</i>"" for Moonstone and the Transformers Trading Card Game Concept artist  (Wizards/Hasbro) to name just a few! When he’s not drawing or selling prints at conventions, he’s usually just getting more coffee.</li>
<li>Our colorist is Cristian John Sabarre from the Leyte, Philippines who has just finished ""<i>Neon Skies</i>"" for Rogue Comics Ireland. His use of popping colors and dark shadows make him a perfect fit to capture the production design of Dark Darkness. More of Cristian's work can be found <u><a href=""https://www.artstation.com/cristiansabarre"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</u>

Three super natural misfits and a nerd vie for the highest honor of darkest dark lord at a comic con of darkness (and all of the powers that come with the title). But before the winner can be chosen, a grisly murder catapults them on a quest to clear their names. In the process they unveil a plot that puts all the Darkness attendees in peril. Will one of them betray the others to rule as darkest dark lord, or will they work together and save the world from eternal darkness?
Why a Graphic Novel?
Dark Darkness started as a serial stage play that morphed into a web series. Having had a little taste of power, the web series mutated into a feature film screenplay in search of Tony Stark-esque to back the movie. Since Tony is hard to get a hold of right now, Dark Darkness dawned the cape of graphic novel, a perfect way to tell this epic fantasy comedy adventure story.
What you get.
We're offering a full color graphic novel between 120 and 134 pages (depending on the final layouts and bonus content) adapted from our 117 page film screenplay. For those that like to get more involved, we've got lots of extras for you too. If we make our goal, we'll also be able to offer stretch goals to backers.. Anyone that chooses a reward for more than $50 will get their name in the back of the book on a ""Thank You"" page next to the credits.










What people are saying about Dark Darkness?

Dark Darkness, the web series has played at festivals all around the world.

The Fantasy Network  has also recognized our web series and invited us to be a part of their streaming platform. You can get 50% off your first 3 months subscription by using promo code BOUNDARYBAY.

Our team!

The story and principle characters of Dark Darkness were created by award winning playwright Ben Eisner. Filmmaker Wilson Large is the writer and has been the driving force behind this story for the last ten years. This process has included and been influenced by dozens of professional creatives from a broad spectrum of talents.
Ben Hansen is doing the linework for the graphic novel. Besides creating character designs, concept art and two posters for Dark Darkness, his artwork is featured in ""Transformers Legends"" mobile app game (NGMOCO Games), ""Zombies Vs Cheerleaders"" for Moonstone and the Transformers Trading Card Game Concept artist  (Wizards/Hasbro) to name just a few! When he’s not drawing or selling prints at conventions, he’s usually just getting more coffee.
Our colorist is Cristian John Sabarre from the Leyte, Philippines who has just finished ""Neon Skies"" for Rogue Comics Ireland. His use of popping colors and dark shadows make him a perfect fit to capture the production design of Dark Darkness. More of Cristian's work can be found here.

Our letterer is Cassie Anderson, an artist from Portland who is working on her own comic, Extraordinary, as well as the sequel to Lifeformed, both soon to be available from Dark Horse Comics. 







Why Crowdfunding?
After investing ten years and more personal finances than Wilson cares to admit, crowdfunding makes the most sense. With your help we can make a product we wouldn't be able to do by ourselves and reach out to the fans who would appreciate work like this.
Risks & Challenges
While failure is not an option for us when it comes to this project, we understand that every project has risks. 

This is Wilson's first comic project as a project manager, but with over 10 years of creative project management experience, he's prepared for bumps in the process and possible delays.
If anyone on the creative team has to stop due to injury and sickness, we will be able to transition other folks onto the team.
Pre-Press, printing, and shipping of books is a complicated process that can lead to delays, and we're doing our best to mitigate those as much as possible.


Other Ways You Can Help

Please make some noises! Bleating sheep noises preferably, but also shout outs to your peeps about how much you wish Darkness would reign supreme or whatever... use your own words (still in sheep bleating voices though).
We made it easy to do a simple share with the social media icons swimming around somewhere up above. Keep in mind if you add a sentence or two about what you like about this campaign, your friends will be more interested based on your personal take on it.

<h3>Help us save print comics and help them evolve!</h3>
<p>Evil Kat Comix has a mission to help comic books evolve. Comic Books have not changed their format since their inception, while other forms of entertainment have radically changed in order to survive. We don't listen to music on 8-track tapes or watch movies with film projectors anymore. Comic books have not changed and that refusal to evolve is leading to the death of print comics. The price of keeping the original format has skyrocketed to the point where comic book collecting has become a very expensive hobby and following even a single character's adventures can sometimes break the bank. It's time for comic books to evolve and it's time to put the 'book' into 'comic books'.</p>
<p>Our flagship title, Evil Kat Comix Presents, is an anthology title that will be released quarterly and contain every story from Evil Kat Comix. The best part is you will get at least 136 pages of stories and bonus material in every issue for only $9.99. So for less than $40 a year you get every story about every character we have for an entire year. We want to make comic books an affordable and enjoyable form of entertainment again! We also strive to give you a variety of entertainment spanning multiple genres. We have superhero stories, horror stories, and anything else that we think you'll enjoy. I promise that with the range of stories in each issue there is something for everyone in each one. So give us a chance and help us save print comics and bring them to their next stage in evolution.</p>

<li>As a thank you for helping us, we tried to think of the kinds of things we would like as collectors ourselves. We came up with some unique and cool ways to show our appreciation, and some truly are one of a kind.</li>

This was clearly not the case for anyone who read the report. Yet on social media we regularly witnessed people believing these lies. They would then perpetuate the falsehoods further. There were mean heated discussions. Often the answer to the question “Did you READ the report?” was met with a “No”. We realized that reading for Trump supporters was as much of an anathema as it was for their leader. We thought, “if only there was a way to simply explain how bad this man is for our country” in a way that they could understand. Maybe some of them would get it. If only there was a coloring book. That ought to be basic enough. That is when “White Lies Matter, Trump For ExPresident 2020” was born.</p><p>This project is a passion project and it is a cathartic release. When we watch the news and continue to see things get worse and worse every month that this administration is in office we often feel helpless. However, working on creating page ideas for this book helped channel anger, frustration and hopelessness into something productive and enjoyable.</p><p>This campaign is about making this coloring book a reality. One that the Trump opposition will enjoy. One that we will want to pass onto others in order to help explain why supporting Trump is harmful to the country and harmful to who we are as Americans. Buy a book. Help make this a reality.</p><h3>Why Indiegogo?</h3><p>To produce a book of this scope costs money. The costs of production goes down the more books we can print in a given run. Our goal is to be able to print at least 50,000 books in the initial run. We also need funds to be able to mail the books to our customers, and produce the rest of the illustrations. Currently we only have budget to produce a few more. With pre-ordering through Indiegogo, we can make this passion project a reality. Our belief in human nature, and our countrymen lead us to believe that there are at least 50,000 people out there who will see value in our project. If that is not the case, then anyone who has supported the campaign will receive a full refund if we do not achieve our goal by August 15th when the campaign ends.</p><h3>Pages So Far</h3><p>The entire coloring book has not been developed yet.

<h3>What is Slava?  </h3>
<p>Slava is a vast, beautiful forgotten world of old gods, heroes, pagan practises, magic and supernatural forces. Fantastical creatures fighting their battles in the clouds or ghosts weaving fate of newborns are just a tip of an iceberg.</p>
<p> </p>
<div><h3>Book 1 -  Between Words</h3></div>
<p>The story starts with the group of druids who are traveling to the holy mountain - Sleza. On top of it they perform a sacred ritual which is meant to lock away evil forces and protect the world for some time. 966 years later, Naja, a young hybrid of a water nymph and a human steals a chest offered to the gods. The chest contents - three runic stones - are the very same runes which were used by druids in the ritual. She doesn't know what they are yet...</p>
<p>Slava is an action adventure story set in a pagan fantasy world.</p>
<p>First book is an adventure of Naja and Bromir, who are on a quest to protect and retrieve mysterious runic stones. They will encounter drowners, demons, strigois, nightwraiths and much more. They will have to fight to death and find the way out from dengerous situations. We will also meet Harrah, a one eyed fiend, who was strong enough to fight the Sun God and now is trying to bring his army to revange after his defeat.</p>
<p>Slava will be a great read for fans of mythology, paganism, viking or tribal stories, and also people who like:<br/>the Witcher, Game of Thrones, Vikings, Warhammer, AD&amp;D, Saga, Assasins Creed, Hobbit, Seven to Eternity, Indiana Jones or Avatar.</p>
<p><br/>We want to treat the first book as an assessment. If you like it, we will be create more.<br/>Book 1 is planned to be 80+ colored pages.</p>

<h3>Czym jest Slava?  </h3>
<p>Slava to rozległy, piękny zapomniany świat starych bogów, bohaterów, pogańskich praktyk, magii i sił nadprzyrodzonych. Fantastyczne stworzenia toczące bitwy w chmurach czy też duchy splatające los noworodków to tylko wierzchołek góry lodowej.</p>

<h3>Tom 1 -  Między Słowami</h3>
<p>Historia zaczyna się od grupy druidów, którzy podróżują do świętej góry - Slezy. Na szczycie odprawiają święty rytuał, który ma na celu zablokowanie sił zła i ochronę świata, na jakiś czas. 966 lat później Naja, młoda hybryda rusałki i człowieka, kradnie skrzynię ofiarowaną bogom. Zawartość skrzyni - trzy kamienie runiczne - to te same runy, których użyli druidzi w swoim rytuale. Naja nie wie jeszcze, czym one są ...</p>

<p>Slava to historia przygodowa, osadzona w pogańskim świecie fantasy.</p>
<p>Pierwsza książka to przygoda Naji i Bromira, których celem jest odzyskanie i ochrona tajemniczych kamieni runicznych. Na swojej drodze spotkają utopców, demony, strzygi, upiory nocne i wiele więcej. Będą musieli walczyć na śmierć i życie i znajdywać wyjście z trudnych sytuacji. Spotkamy także Harraha, jednookiego biesa, który niegdyś był wystarczająco silny, aby walczyć z Bogiem Słońca, a teraz próbuje odbudować swoją armię i szuka rewanżu po swojej porażce.</p>
<p>Slava będzie świetną lekturą dla fanów mitologii, pogaństwa, opowieści plemiennych czy o wikingach, a także dla osób, które lubią: Wiedźmina, Grę o Tron, Wikingów, Warhammera, AD&amp;D, Sagę, Assasins Creed, Hobbita, Seven to Eternity, Indiana Jones'a lub Avatar.</p>

</div></div>","What is Slava?  
Slava is a vast, beautiful forgotten world of old gods, heroes, pagan practises, magic and supernatural forces. Fantastical creatures fighting their battles in the clouds or ghosts weaving fate of newborns are just a tip of an iceberg.
 
Book 1 -  Between Words
The story starts with the group of druids who are traveling to the holy mountain - Sleza. On top of it they perform a sacred ritual which is meant to lock away evil forces and protect the world for some time. 966 years later, Naja, a young hybrid of a water nymph and a human steals a chest offered to the gods. The chest contents - three runic stones - are the very same runes which were used by druids in the ritual. She doesn't know what they are yet...
Slava is an action adventure story set in a pagan fantasy world.
First book is an adventure of Naja and Bromir, who are on a quest to protect and retrieve mysterious runic stones. They will encounter drowners, demons, strigois, nightwraiths and much more. They will have to fight to death and find the way out from dengerous situations. We will also meet Harrah, a one eyed fiend, who was strong enough to fight the Sun God and now is trying to bring his army to revange after his defeat.
Slava will be a great read for fans of mythology, paganism, viking or tribal stories, and also people who like:the Witcher, Game of Thrones, Vikings, Warhammer, AD&D, Saga, Assasins Creed, Hobbit, Seven to Eternity, Indiana Jones or Avatar.
We want to treat the first book as an assessment. If you like it, we will be create more.Book 1 is planned to be 80+ colored pages.

I am offering digital and printed versions of the comic, as well as some special metal artwork for top tier contributors.
The funds will be solely attributed to the comic, if the campaign doesn't reach the goal, I will use whatever funds gathered to work on the series.


The Impact

This project is the first in the beginning of Awakened Entertainment, I have 3 major titles to be released by early next year.
Awakened Entertainment will bring a fresh and diverse look at comics that is much needed.
I have already completed Lynx 1-3 and have built a good following for the book.  4 is almost complete and on schedule to complete by July.


Risks & Challenges

Sometimes artists have issues completing work due to family or other obstacles.
I have addressed this with great experience as I worked on issues 1-3, and now have a great relationship with many artists, editors, letterers, colorers, and more.

<p>The next chapter from Limitless Comics is a high-action book that takes us to the streets (and back to the sewers) of Boston! This story is the comic book, SOLO88 Issue #1.</p>
<h2>The Story</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>88 is a character that Anthony Moore created in 1993, and like with The MuffenMan #1, the right team has finally been assembled to bring this story to life. This comic is about a merc who doesn't play by the numbers!</p>
<p>Picking up where The Muffenman #1 left off, SOLO88 #1 is picking up the story of the gun-toting, chain-smoking hitman of Limitless Comics. He has travelled around the world, but a tragic loss brought him back to Boston, MA. The only chance 88 has to rectify this tragedy, is by agreeing to work a job for the sinister crime-boss, Mr. Rushmore. His target? The MuffenMan!</p>

<h3>Limitless Comics and 88</h3> <p>The gritty, action story of 88 is the next to join the Limitless line-up. If this is your first exposure to Limitless Comics, welcome!

<p>The next title we are launching is 88! This mature, action-packed series will continue the story of the Boston-based characters from the Muffenman series. This story also introduces new characters, tells the next chapter of our story, and expands our universe. It doesn't get more Limitless than that!</p>

<h3>The Story So Far...</h3>
<p>In the fall of 2019, four friends created a cosplay group comprised of original characters from or inspired by the book series Tales of the Decoverse by John Pyka. They became The League of Impossibilists; time traveling paranormal heroes defending the space time continuum from supernatural threats!</p>
<p>Doug Oller joined the team and proposed creating a comic series. The comic series has been published incrementally as a web comic but now it is time to take it to the next level!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To finish the comic for proper publication we need $2,000. That money will go to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hiring a professional letterer to re-do the word balloons and captions to bring the book in line with publishing standards.</li>
<li>We will hire a professional digital colorist to bring the art to life in full color! </li>
<li>All contributors will get 2 copies of the finished book - one in print and one in digital! </li>
<li>Even if we don't reach our full goal, we will still use money raised towards this goal of finishing the work. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>This comic will be part of the Tales of the Decoverse series. It will become Volume 5!</p>
<ul>
<li>Doug Oller fulfills a life long dream of becoming a published comicbook artist!</li>
<li>John Pyka rekindles a passion put on the shelf over 25 years ago!</li>
<li>And this comic becomes the first time a Middle TN based Cosplay Group are adapted in comic form!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Are there risks? Sure. The risk is that we don't meet our goal and have to settle for less than the moon. HOWEVER, the publishing deal is already signed with Seventh Star Press and Volumes 1 - 4 will already completed. </p>
<p>We've got publisher support for the finished product, and it will be produced. But with your help, we can get there faster</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We get it. Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can also contribute a small monthly amount via Patreon.com/impossibilists to see the progress so far and read the chapters as they are completed every week!</li>
<li>Help us promote! Help get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.</li>
<li>Indiegogo makes sharing easy! Just use the handy share tools to share with your friends on social media and everywhere you can!</li>

What We Need & What You Get
To finish the comic for proper publication we need $2,000. That money will go to:

Hiring a professional letterer to re-do the word balloons and captions to bring the book in line with publishing standards.
We will hire a professional digital colorist to bring the art to life in full color! 
All contributors will get 2 copies of the finished book - one in print and one in digital! 
Even if we don't reach our full goal, we will still use money raised towards this goal of finishing the work. 


This comic will be part of the Tales of the Decoverse series. It will become Volume 5!

Doug Oller fulfills a life long dream of becoming a published comicbook artist!
John Pyka rekindles a passion put on the shelf over 25 years ago!
And this comic becomes the first time a Middle TN based Cosplay Group are adapted in comic form!


Risks & Challenges
Are there risks? Sure. The risk is that we don't meet our goal and have to settle for less than the moon. HOWEVER, the publishing deal is already signed with Seventh Star Press and Volumes 1 - 4 will already completed. 
We've got publisher support for the finished product, and it will be produced. But with your help, we can get there faster
