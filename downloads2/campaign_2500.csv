<h3>Book Project ""HDB: Homes of Singapore""<br/>
</h3>
<p>Singapore's Housing Development Board (HDB) has built one of the world's best and fascinating public housing solutions. ""HDB:
 Homes of Singapore"" is a pictorial journey of photographs taken over a 
period of three years that portray the diversity, culture, 
individuality, colours and creativity within HDB homes. This project is 
the brainchild of the artist duo Eitaro Ogawa and Tamae Iwasaki of KEYAKISMOS, with architect Tomohisa Miyauchi. <br/></p>

</div> <div> <h3>Join our journey </h3>
<p></p>Our journey began in 2008 when we considered purchasing a HDB flat. To tell the truth, we were a little concerned about living in what seemed like rigid and uniformed units at the time, but that changed completely after visiting friends' homes, namely flats that were renovated so uniquely. Since then we toyed with the idea of making a book about HDBs. This materialised when we met and shared the idea with Tomo in 2013. We immediately got to work, taking photos that very weekend! We got in touch with as many people in our address books as we possible in a bid to search and capture interesting flats. We even knocked on the doors of strangers who, to our surprise and delight, welcomed and even fed us well on many occasions! Throughout this project, what touched us the most was the kindness of people's hearts, the lives they live and the generosity that enabled such rich story-sharing. Singaporeans often speak of the lack of culture in Singapore yet we found this to be quite the contradiction because we discovered much culture residing in the topic of the HDB flat alone! Culture was evident in each home. Culture was lived. At the end of the project, we gathered plenty of photos. But more importantly, we got to know Singapore a lot more through uncovering the multifarious and personal way of living beyond the exteriors of the HDB flat-- and this was something we wanted the photographs to capture. <br/><p></p>

</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>We are aiming to produce a 2017 Calendar showcasing some of the finest landscapes from around the UK. By combining the talents of photographers Francis Taylor and Adam Sherratt our calendar will deliver a selection of some of their best work, bound together in a high quality A3 wall calendar. The aim of this project is to raise funds for the 'Fix Our Father' campaign.  </p>
<p>Fix our Father is urgently trying to raise money for Karl Bullimore, a Grantham man, who in October 2015 was diagnosed with stage 4 bladder cancer.  This particular form of cancer is so rare that the NHS weren't able to offer treatment. However, the family has been able to find hope through a private oncology clinic in London. Karl started a course of chemotherapy while a targeted immunology drug therapy was developed specifically for him. Unfortunately this particular type of treatment is vastly expensive. The Bullimore family has exhausted their life savings and have only been able to carry on treatment through the generosity of family and friends.</p>
<p>This is where you come in. We need your assistance in funding this calendar so that we can use it as a platform to raise money for Karl and his family, in order to help them carry on with treatment. </p>

Ring bound and printed on high quality paper, the calendar will be packed full of stunning landscape photography ensuring you have something beautiful to keep track of those all important dates throughout 2017. </p>
<p>With images provided by Adam and Francis, the calendar will be A3 (297w x 420h mm) sized, packed full of beautiful landscape photography and presented in a stylish month by month spiral bound form.</p>

<p>Our proposal has been accepted as part of the 3 juried group curated shows during <strong><a href=""http://athensjewelryweek.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Athens Jewelry Week 2018</a> </strong>in Athens, Greece. AJW is a week-long International art jewelry show held in May hosted by the non-profit organization [anti]clastics. Our participation in this event would mean that we will be renting a local gallery space, curating work, and traveling to Greece to  install it in conjunction with the main event show curated by [anti]clastics.</p>
<p><strong>ATHENS JEWELRY WEEK</strong> “aims through collective action, to promote Contemporary Greek Jewelry both in Greece and abroad.” Our aim in participating in AJW2018 is to present our contemporary jewelry to the wider public, while showing the international diversity and artistic dimension of works being produced by emerging artists from the United States.</p>
<p>We (Melis and Rachel) met at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 2013 while Melis was pursuing her MFA and Rachel, her BFA. Since then, we have supported each other in our artistic endeavors. We are both active participants in creating individual bodies of work that examine various forms of love, loss, mourning, and burden. Separately, we have shown our individual works in several national and international venues, and have now reached a milestone in our emerging careers with being accepted to curate and exhibit a joint show of our work internationally. </p>
<p>With your donations, the funding of this project would allow us to bring our work to a broader international audience and represent emerging American makers. It would be both individual promotion of our works, but also a promotion of emerging artists that will hopefully foster future opportunities to connect with galleries and makers around the world.</p>
<p>We are committing to showing <strong><i>What Lies Beneath </i></strong>during <strong>Athens Jewelry Week 2018</strong>. As emerging artists with limited financial resources, funding of this project would allow us to both to transport our work and displays, travel to Athens, install our work, host our opening, and pay for our participation and registration fees-- in total about $8,500 USD. All proceeds raised would go towards making this event a reality.</p>
<p>In return for your donations, we are happy to offer a variety of rewards!</p>
<p>If we do not reach our entire goal, the raised proceeds will go to covering our venue rental, display/installation materials, and transport of our work. Whatever costs are left over will be covered by us individually.</p>
<p>However, should we find ourselves fortunate enough to exceed our goal of $8,500 USD, all further funding will go toward other necessary expenses that we may incur during the process of putting on this show, including travel while in Greece, lodging, and promotional materials (show cards, posters, etc.).</p>
<p>Participating in AJW18 is a huge step in our individual careers as well as our joint effort in putting together a traveling version of this two person show for the future. Experience and relationships fostered through our participation with international gallerists and buyers will also help us on our journey to further grow as artists and connect to the greater art jewelry community. </p>

<p>OUR STORY:</p>
<p>We are group of theatre makers based in the Sweden, UK and Southern Africa, who are interested in telling untold stories and presenting performances that question mainstream norms in our society. We believe theatre can both entertain and create social change. We do this by producing thought provoking theatre and run participatory workshops that engage people in dialogue.</p>
<p>In this project, we are working as a collaborative towards our goal – to open-up dialogue about diversity and belonging by presenting a theatrical performance and accompanying workshops to diverse audiences around South Africa. We will be performing as part of the main programme at the National Arts Festival in Grahamstown, and then traveling onto PopArt in Johannesburg and the Alexander Bar and Theatre in Cape Town. Parallel to our performances we are running our participatory workshops in collaboration with Drama For Life, South Africa’s leading centre for theatre and research in applied arts.</p>
<p>We’re excited to bring The Incident to new audiences and engage in new, bold discussions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>WHY THE INCIDENT?</p>
<p>The Incident is a poignant theatrical performance about whether you are ready to stand up for your values when the stakes are raised. Are we prepared to and can we change our behaviors in order to understand others? The play and the workshop make the audience and participants reflect over how we are shaped by our experiences, including our cultural and ethnic backgrounds, and how it influences the ways we see the world and how we treat other people.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>IMPACT</p>
<p>We believe that theatre can be a vehicle for dialogue and social change. Through the play, we want to open up a dialogue about race and gender relations - an important topic that people often find difficult to talk about. We will have post-show discussions and ask for feedback from the audience on the topics raised. We will also run workshops that use scenes from the play and Theatre of the Oppressed techniques to create a safe space for audience and community members alike to discuss the themes of the show in relation to their own experiences. The National Arts Festival is the highlight of the South African arts scene and both a South African and international audience. we are looking forward to bringing this highly relevant performance to South African and international audiences. Through our partnership with Drama for Life we are aiming to create a long-term collaboration where we can continue to run our workshops for different communities in South Africa and possibly create new work. The National Arts Festival is also an opportunity for us to create new partnerships in South Africa and beyond.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</p>
<p>We have created a number of partnerships for our South African run but we need an additional £1000 to cover our local travel accommodation cost for our team of performers, workshop facilitators and director.</p>
<p>Your contribution will help pay for travel and accommodation costs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you contribute:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>£10 – You will receive free weekly updates to your e-mail from the production (voluntary)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>£20 – Your name will appear in the ‘thank you’ section on our website and social media (voluntary)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>£50 – All of the above + You will get thank you message from the Artistic Team and your name will appear in the production program</p>
<p> </p>
<p>£100 -  All of the above + You will get personal message from the Artistic Team and your name will appear in the production program and on our website and social media.</p>

<h3>Short Summary </h3>
<p>            My name is Adam DeDecker and this time last year The Giving Tree started to sprout into more than a dream. Little did I know it was going to receive two awards of excellence at burning man 2017 and was the largest an most stunning piece that the Arise music and art festival has seen in its five years. I purchased the base vehicle of The Giving Tree in 2015, a 1989 blue bird short bus that I converted into my off the grid green mobile home to travel the nation with my best friend Spudz McKenzee the coolest golden retriever to lay a paw on this earth! We formed many good memories on the road together unfortunately I lost him March 3, 2017. We loved sharing the outdoors together. My best friend shared many great understandings of life but this last year I learned that not everything was meant to be understood. So with great loss I created uplifting art and it continued to fill my spirit with all kinds of unconditional love and happiness from all walks of life. The Giving Tree has allowed me to continue to share my best friends great spirit. It's very sacred to keep the giving tree alive for its journey is not complete. We are campaigning to raise funds for a new engine. We have already been invited back to Burning man 2018. It's a real bummer but the old engine has retired permanently so we are getting it in the shop to get ready for the new engine transplant. Please help us bring The Giving Tree back to life. We would love to make it to a few events before arriving to the playa this year.</p>
</div><div>
<p>            We are raising funds for a new engine, the old engine has retired and we are looking to purchase a remanufactured 7.3 liter IDI diesel engine to replace the old one. A new engine on the low end will cost around  $3,000  before the install. Anything we raise over our goal will be invested into any extra install fees and beyond that upgrades to The Giving Tree such as a new 6000 watt generator and 6500 watt power inverter that the playa claimed last year, we could also upgrade our sound system and lighting. If we don't reach our goal all the funds we do raise will still be invested toward the new engine. However if we do reach our goal  before the campaign ends, then we will be able to keep the fundraiser rolling to help with all the fun upgrades that we want to improve on this year! Besides just replacing the engine which is our main objective at the moment. Anything helps and we are very determined to make it back to playa and hopefully a few events before we return home this year. We have a great track record for a first year art car, in fact it's better than great. Burning Man awarded it excellence to the second power and Arise music and art festival loved every minute of it and more. We are currently based in Gardnerville, NV just south of Reno. So if you would like to contribute hands on, we always love learning and building together with our local community. We have new perks this time around. Giving Tree stickers, koozies, T-shirts, Hats and more. We are very excited about our return to the playa 2018 please contribute by spreading the word about our campaign. Thank you all for taking the time to read about our journey! Let the giving never stop as we will continue to give unconditional inspiration. For we are so grateful, may all your wonderful dreams come true.</p>

<p><strong> Summary of this Project </strong></p>
<p>Greetings, fellow human BE-ing. Thank you for showing up to this space for a look around. My name is Reena Marie Spansail {she//her}l, and for now, I will be your guide for your journey through the labyrinth. This interactive experience of walking a labyrinth while looking at art inspired by the story of Aradne, one of the characters in the most famous myth of the labyrinth of King Minos, where Thesus slew the Minotaur, is both an art show and a remembering, a chance to engage with an ancient symbol of transformation, and noticing how interacting with this pattern has transformed me as an artist. </p>
<p>This artistic experience is important to me because it is a metaphor and a portal for our collective healing and grief journey. I believe we all need to have space to unpack and untangle the knots of the past year and half (at least!) and this is the space I have envisioned for us to do that. This show will be up for about 3 weeks, and it will live on as a digital artefact on my website, <a href=""http://www.reenart.space/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">reenart.space</a>, after the show leaves the gallery. </p>
<p>Finally, especially if it is the case we haven’t met, I’d like you to know some things I call myself, and some things I practice. I alternately call myself a multimedia artist, your friendly neighborhood art teacher, wyrdo, moon-gazer, shaper of culture, and a member of the Wander Society. I practice in writing poems, sculpting ceramics, dance, breathing mindfully, getting still, devotion, ink painting, water and color. My ongoing intentions are to quicken and nourish artful, creative experience in my personal, professional, and performative living. I invite you to join me this August (Leo-Virgo season) in an exercise in artful living by funding an interactive labyrinth gallery experience at the Potentialist Workshop Gallery in Reno, Nevada, on the unceded lands of the Numu Paiute people.</p>
<p>I am honored to work with this sacred symbol, and act as a conduit of our collective abundance of visual, performative, and ritual knowledge for transforming ourselves as we walk through the Labyrinth of our lives. Thank you for your consideration, time, and space. </p>
<p>Godxspeed! </p> <p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Recieve </strong></p>
<p><u>Here’s a breakdown of our funding request:</u></p>

NOSTRO PROGETTO</b></p>
<p>L’<b>Accademia
Musicale Mediterranea </b>di
Carini (Palermo) è un centro multifunzionale che si autofinanzia
poiché non gode ancora di nessun contributo pubblico. Il nostro
sogno è quello di realizzare il progetto <b>Carini
Piazza d’Arte,</b>
ideato nel 2014 e che punta
alla riscoperta di alcuni tra i più importanti e suggestivi luoghi
della città di Carini, molti dei quali troppo spesso trascurati e
non adeguatamente valorizzati. Attraverso la programmazione di 
mostre, concerti, concorsi musicali, saggi e seminari di volta in
volta abbiamo dato risalto ad un luogo diverso della città, che per
l’occasione è diventato palcoscenico dei nostri spettacoli: dal
rinomato Castello di Carini alla meno conosciuta ma altrettanto
incantevole Chiesa degli Agonizzanti, dal Chiostro dei Carmelitani a
Piazza delle Vittorie, dal Teatro Totuccio Aiello al Baglio al Mare e
tanti altri che, ospitando le manifestazioni organizzate
dall’Accademia, vengono messi in luce, riqualificati e vissuti con
più partecipazione da ogni cittadino. L’obiettivo di <b>Carini
Piazza D’Arte </b>è
quello di proseguire su questa strada da poco intrapresa,  dando vita
ad un calendario di eventi musicali e culturali per il 2016 che abbia
come protagonisti i monumenti della nostra città, anche quelli meno
conosciuti e a volte dimenticati, ma non per questo meno
affascinanti. All’interno di questo contesto, uno degli obiettivi è
quello di organizzare delle Masterclass con artisti di chiara fama
internazionale che hanno già dato la loro disponibilità, al fine di
impreziosire il nostro calendario eventi. Grazie alla nostra
iniziativa infatti, gli stessi carinesi hanno riscoperto chiese,
piazze e scorci che fino a poco tempo fa erano caduti nell’oblio.
Il riscontro che abbiamo ottenuto in questi mesi da parte dei nostri
concittadini, ci spinge a non mollare e a continuare a credere nella
possibilità di mettere in pratica le nostre intenzioni a lungo
termine.</p>
<p><b>PERCH SOSTENERCI </b></p>
<p>A
causa dei grossi limiti economici, quest’anno siamo riusciti a
realizzare alcune delle iniziative previste dal progetto <b>Carini
Piazza D’Arte</b>,
soprattutto grazie alla forza di volontà e all’impegno di giovani
musicisti autoctoni e non, dei maestri, degli allievi, e di tutti
coloro i quali hanno sposato con entusiasmo la nostra causa. Ad oggi
però, trovandoci  senza fondi,  rischiamo di doverci fermare e di
non poter portare avanti il progetto. Per questo motivo, anche un
piccolo contributo può aiutarci a proseguire la realizzazione di
questo sogno in musica.

Ringranziadovi
in anticipo, vi invitiamo a continuare la lettura e a conoscerci
meglio.</p><p><b>L'ACCADEMIA
MUSICALE MEDITERRANEA</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>
La
musica come veicolo di integrazione e di solidarietà, la cultura in
senso lato come occasione di crescita individuale, anche
professionale. Sono questi i princìpi che guidano l'azione
dell'Accademia Musicale Mediterranea di
Carini (Palermo).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Corsi
di studio tenuti da docenti di rilievo nazionale e internazionale e
rivolti ai bambini e ai ragazzi costituiscono il cuore   delle
attività dell'Accademia, che comprendono anche stage formativi,
<i>masterclass</i>
e <i>workshop.
</i>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Il
lavoro svolto dal gruppo che anima l'AMM mira all'alta formazione
musicale, sia classica che moderna, dei propri allievi, che siano
consapevoli della massima rilevanza del concetto di progettualità
nella realizzazione dei loro percorsi di crescita creativa e
professionale.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Una
formazione che sia davvero per tutti, diretta a chi ha talento da far
emergere, al di là delle proprie possibilità economiche.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Inoltre,
l'Accademia punta da sempre al coinvolgimento di tutta la comunità
locale attraverso l'ideazione e la realizzazione di eventi quali
concerti, concorsi e mostre, con lo scopo ulteriore e l'ambizione di
diventare un polo di eccellenza musicale per tutto il bacino del
Mediterraneo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Infine,
vi presentiamo due delle nostre formazioni: la Mediterranea Jazz
Orchestra e il Coro di voci bianche.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<b>Mediterranea
Jazz Orchestra</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>
Formatasi
durante l'anno accademico 2014/2015, è il principale organico
strumentale della Accademia Musicale Mediterranea. È un'orchestra di
diciotto elementi, spesso integrata da altre sezioni strumentali, e
vede la collaborazione di docenti e allievi con artisti del panorama
jazzistico nazionale. Il suo debutto è avvenuto il 5 luglio 2015
presso il Chiostro di San Vincenzo a Carini (Palermo), sotto la
direzione di Roberto Basile, attuale direttore e responsabile
musicale della MJO, nonché membro fondatore dell’AMM. 
</p>
<p>
La
formazione è impegnata nella diffusione di progetti speciali e nella
realizzazione di proprie produzioni originali.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<b>Coro
di Voci Bianche dell’Accademia Musicale Mediterranea</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>
Nato
nel marzo del 2011, il Coro di voci bianche dell’Accademia Musicale
Mediterranea è costituito da circa quaranta bambini selezionati tra
gli alunni di tutte le scuole del comune di Carini. Il lavoro del
coro, diretto dal Maestro Maura Aresu, si basa su incontri
settimanali dedicati allo studio della musica, della vocalità e del
repertorio. Per gli allievi si tratta di una preziosa
opportunità  formativa culturale e musicale. 
</p>
<p>
Il
coro ha partecipato a numerosi eventi, distinguendosi anche 
fuori dalla realtà cittadina, in produzioni svoltesi in luoghi quali
il Teatro Politeama ""Giuseppe Garibaldi"" di Palermo, il
Duomo di Caccamo e in centri esterni al Palermitano come Noto e
Lipari.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------</p><p><a name=""english"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">English</a></p><p></p><p><b>VETRINA</b></p>
<p>Make
Carini a stage: help us organize cultural events in the most
suggestive locations of our city.</p>
<p>The
<b>Accademia
Musicale Mediterranea</b>
in Carini (Palermo, Italy) is a self-financing multifunctional center
that doesn’t benefit from public funding. We want to make our dream
of <b>Carini
Piazza D’Arte</b>
come true. This project was conceived in 2014 and its goal is the
rebirth of some of the most important and beautiful places in Carini,
that have been neglected and not promoted.</p>
<p>Our
exhibits,
concerts, music contests, shows, recitals and workshops have
highlighted a different location each time making it the stage of our
events: the well known Castello di Carini or the less known but very
fascinating Chiesa degli Agonizzanti, the Chiostro dei Carmelitani
and the Piazza delle Vittorie, the Totuccio Aiello Theatre rather
than the Baglio al Mare and many other locations have hosted the
events organized by the Accademia and thus they have been enjoyed by
the community with great emotional participation.</p>
<p>The
purpose of <b>Carini
Piazza D’Arte</b>
is to continue on this path to initiate an agenda of cultural and
musical events 2016 that turns the spotlight on the monuments of our
city, especially on the less known and sometimes forgotten. One of
our goals is to organize a Masterclass featuring international
artists who are fully available to cooperate with us so as to enhance
our agenda. Thanks to our initiative, the “<i>Carinesi”
</i>discovered
again churches, plazas and landscapes that  had faded into obscurity
until not long ago. The great response to our project encourages us
to never give up and to keep believing in the opportunity to reach
our long term goals.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>WHY
WE NEED YOUR HELP</b></p>
<p>Despite
the financial straits, this year we succeeded in hitting some targets
of <b>Carini
Piazza D’Arte, </b>especially
thanks to the willpower and to the dedication of the young local
musicians, of the teachers, of the students and of all of those who
embraced our cause with passion. The current lack of assets might
force us to suspend the project. This is why even a little donation
can help us make our dream in music come true.</p>
<p>Thanking
you in advance, we suggest you to read more about us.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>THE
ACCADEMIA MUSICALE MEDITERRANEA</b></p>
<p>Music
as integration and solidarity, as culture , as individual and
professional enrichment: these are the foundations of our mission. 
</p>
<p>The
core of our academy lies in the courses held by international and
national teachers for children and teenagers, in the masterclasses
and workshops.</p>
<p>The
work of the group that leads the Academy aims for a qualified
classical and modern musical education in order to increase the
student’s creative, artistic and professional growth.</p>
<p>We
support the concept of education for everyone, for who is talented in
despite of one’s economic possibility.</p>
<p>Our
events, concerts, contests and exhibitions have always taken place in
the local community with the ambition to be a center of musical
excellence in all the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>In
addition, we want to present our institutions: The Mediterranean Jazz
Orchestra and The White Voices Choir.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>The Mediterrean Jazz Orchestra</b></p>
<p>The
Mediterranean Jazz Orchestra born in 2014 is the main instrumental
band of the A. M. M. It is composed of 18 musicians, with the
collaboration of other music sections including the presence of
important popular jazz musicians. The debut on July, 5 2015 at the
Chiostro of San Vincenzo in Carini was conducted by Roberto Basile,
the present director and music responsible of the MJO and member of
the A.M.M. The Orchestra’s aim is to spread special projects and
perform its own original works.</p>
<p><br/>
</p><p><b>The White Voices Choir</b></p>
<p>The
White Voices Choir born in March 2011 is composed of 40 children
selected in all the schools in Carini. Its program directed by the M°
Maura Aresu is based on meetings centered in the history of music,
singing and repertoire. It’s considered as an excellent opportunity

NOSTRO PROGETTO
L’Accademia
Musicale Mediterranea di
Carini (Palermo) è un centro multifunzionale che si autofinanzia
poiché non gode ancora di nessun contributo pubblico. Il nostro
sogno è quello di realizzare il progetto Carini
Piazza d’Arte,
ideato nel 2014 e che punta
alla riscoperta di alcuni tra i più importanti e suggestivi luoghi
della città di Carini, molti dei quali troppo spesso trascurati e
non adeguatamente valorizzati. Attraverso la programmazione di 
mostre, concerti, concorsi musicali, saggi e seminari di volta in
volta abbiamo dato risalto ad un luogo diverso della città, che per
l’occasione è diventato palcoscenico dei nostri spettacoli: dal
rinomato Castello di Carini alla meno conosciuta ma altrettanto
incantevole Chiesa degli Agonizzanti, dal Chiostro dei Carmelitani a
Piazza delle Vittorie, dal Teatro Totuccio Aiello al Baglio al Mare e
tanti altri che, ospitando le manifestazioni organizzate
dall’Accademia, vengono messi in luce, riqualificati e vissuti con
più partecipazione da ogni cittadino. L’obiettivo di Carini
Piazza D’Arte è
quello di proseguire su questa strada da poco intrapresa,  dando vita
ad un calendario di eventi musicali e culturali per il 2016 che abbia
come protagonisti i monumenti della nostra città, anche quelli meno
conosciuti e a volte dimenticati, ma non per questo meno
affascinanti. All’interno di questo contesto, uno degli obiettivi è
quello di organizzare delle Masterclass con artisti di chiara fama
internazionale che hanno già dato la loro disponibilità, al fine di
impreziosire il nostro calendario eventi. Grazie alla nostra
iniziativa infatti, gli stessi carinesi hanno riscoperto chiese,
piazze e scorci che fino a poco tempo fa erano caduti nell’oblio.
Il riscontro che abbiamo ottenuto in questi mesi da parte dei nostri
concittadini, ci spinge a non mollare e a continuare a credere nella
possibilità di mettere in pratica le nostre intenzioni a lungo
termine.
PERCH SOSTENERCI 
A
causa dei grossi limiti economici, quest’anno siamo riusciti a
realizzare alcune delle iniziative previste dal progetto Carini
Piazza D’Arte,
soprattutto grazie alla forza di volontà e all’impegno di giovani
musicisti autoctoni e non, dei maestri, degli allievi, e di tutti
coloro i quali hanno sposato con entusiasmo la nostra causa. Ad oggi
però, trovandoci  senza fondi,  rischiamo di doverci fermare e di
non poter portare avanti il progetto. Per questo motivo, anche un
piccolo contributo può aiutarci a proseguire la realizzazione di
questo sogno in musica. 

Ringranziadovi
in anticipo, vi invitiamo a continuare la lettura e a conoscerci
meglio.L'ACCADEMIA
MUSICALE MEDITERRANEA


La
musica come veicolo di integrazione e di solidarietà, la cultura in
senso lato come occasione di crescita individuale, anche
professionale. Sono questi i princìpi che guidano l'azione
dell'Accademia Musicale Mediterranea di
Carini (Palermo).


Corsi
di studio tenuti da docenti di rilievo nazionale e internazionale e
rivolti ai bambini e ai ragazzi costituiscono il cuore   delle
attività dell'Accademia, che comprendono anche stage formativi,
masterclass
e workshop.




Il
lavoro svolto dal gruppo che anima l'AMM mira all'alta formazione
musicale, sia classica che moderna, dei propri allievi, che siano
consapevoli della massima rilevanza del concetto di progettualità
nella realizzazione dei loro percorsi di crescita creativa e
professionale.


Una
formazione che sia davvero per tutti, diretta a chi ha talento da far
emergere, al di là delle proprie possibilità economiche.


Inoltre,
l'Accademia punta da sempre al coinvolgimento di tutta la comunità
locale attraverso l'ideazione e la realizzazione di eventi quali
concerti, concorsi e mostre, con lo scopo ulteriore e l'ambizione di
diventare un polo di eccellenza musicale per tutto il bacino del
Mediterraneo.


Infine,
vi presentiamo due delle nostre formazioni: la Mediterranea Jazz
Orchestra e il Coro di voci bianche.


Mediterranea
Jazz Orchestra


Formatasi
durante l'anno accademico 2014/2015, è il principale organico
strumentale della Accademia Musicale Mediterranea. È un'orchestra di
diciotto elementi, spesso integrata da altre sezioni strumentali, e
vede la collaborazione di docenti e allievi con artisti del panorama
jazzistico nazionale. Il suo debutto è avvenuto il 5 luglio 2015
presso il Chiostro di San Vincenzo a Carini (Palermo), sotto la
direzione di Roberto Basile, attuale direttore e responsabile
musicale della MJO, nonché membro fondatore dell’AMM. 


La
formazione è impegnata nella diffusione di progetti speciali e nella
realizzazione di proprie produzioni originali.


Coro
di Voci Bianche dell’Accademia Musicale Mediterranea


Nato
nel marzo del 2011, il Coro di voci bianche dell’Accademia Musicale
Mediterranea è costituito da circa quaranta bambini selezionati tra
gli alunni di tutte le scuole del comune di Carini. Il lavoro del
coro, diretto dal Maestro Maura Aresu, si basa su incontri
settimanali dedicati allo studio della musica, della vocalità e del
repertorio. Per gli allievi si tratta di una preziosa
opportunità  formativa culturale e musicale. 


Il
coro ha partecipato a numerosi eventi, distinguendosi anche 
fuori dalla realtà cittadina, in produzioni svoltesi in luoghi quali
il Teatro Politeama ""Giuseppe Garibaldi"" di Palermo, il
Duomo di Caccamo e in centri esterni al Palermitano come Noto e
Lipari.---------------------------------------------------EnglishVETRINA
Make
Carini a stage: help us organize cultural events in the most
suggestive locations of our city.
The
Accademia
Musicale Mediterranea
in Carini (Palermo, Italy) is a self-financing multifunctional center
that doesn’t benefit from public funding. We want to make our dream
of Carini
Piazza D’Arte
come true. This project was conceived in 2014 and its goal is the
rebirth of some of the most important and beautiful places in Carini,
that have been neglected and not promoted.
Our
exhibits,
concerts, music contests, shows, recitals and workshops have
highlighted a different location each time making it the stage of our
events: the well known Castello di Carini or the less known but very
fascinating Chiesa degli Agonizzanti, the Chiostro dei Carmelitani
and the Piazza delle Vittorie, the Totuccio Aiello Theatre rather
than the Baglio al Mare and many other locations have hosted the
events organized by the Accademia and thus they have been enjoyed by
the community with great emotional participation.
The
purpose of Carini
Piazza D’Arte
is to continue on this path to initiate an agenda of cultural and
musical events 2016 that turns the spotlight on the monuments of our
city, especially on the less known and sometimes forgotten. One of
our goals is to organize a Masterclass featuring international
artists who are fully available to cooperate with us so as to enhance
our agenda. Thanks to our initiative, the “Carinesi”
discovered
again churches, plazas and landscapes that  had faded into obscurity
until not long ago. The great response to our project encourages us
to never give up and to keep believing in the opportunity to reach
our long term goals.WHY
WE NEED YOUR HELP
Despite
the financial straits, this year we succeeded in hitting some targets
of Carini
Piazza D’Arte, especially
thanks to the willpower and to the dedication of the young local
musicians, of the teachers, of the students and of all of those who
embraced our cause with passion. The current lack of assets might
force us to suspend the project. This is why even a little donation
can help us make our dream in music come true.
Thanking
you in advance, we suggest you to read more about us.THE
ACCADEMIA MUSICALE MEDITERRANEA
Music
as integration and solidarity, as culture , as individual and
professional enrichment: these are the foundations of our mission. 

The
core of our academy lies in the courses held by international and
national teachers for children and teenagers, in the masterclasses
and workshops.
The
work of the group that leads the Academy aims for a qualified
classical and modern musical education in order to increase the
student’s creative, artistic and professional growth.
We
support the concept of education for everyone, for who is talented in
despite of one’s economic possibility.
Our
events, concerts, contests and exhibitions have always taken place in
the local community with the ambition to be a center of musical
excellence in all the Mediterranean.
In
addition, we want to present our institutions: The Mediterranean Jazz
Orchestra and The White Voices Choir.The Mediterrean Jazz Orchestra
The
Mediterranean Jazz Orchestra born in 2014 is the main instrumental
band of the A. M. M. It is composed of 18 musicians, with the
collaboration of other music sections including the presence of
important popular jazz musicians. The debut on July, 5 2015 at the
Chiostro of San Vincenzo in Carini was conducted by Roberto Basile,
the present director and music responsible of the MJO and member of
the A.M.M. The Orchestra’s aim is to spread special projects and
perform its own original works.

The White Voices Choir
The
White Voices Choir born in March 2011 is composed of 40 children
selected in all the schools in Carini. Its program directed by the M°
Maura Aresu is based on meetings centered in the history of music,
singing and repertoire. It’s considered as an excellent opportunity
in the process of cultural and musical development. In these years
the choir participated to many events non only in Carini, but in
Palermo at the Teatro Politeama “Giuseppe Garibaldi”, in Caccamo
at the Duomo, in Noto and in Lipari.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

FAR HORIZONS is a FREE monthly eMagazine, brought about from a simple idea to let unpublished, thinly published and  self-published writers and artists showcase their work to the World.
The first issue (no. 1 April 2014) was released on the 17th of April, 2014.
Far Horizons is only possible due to the hard work of a small group of volunteers.   Far Horizons staff include self-published and trad published writers, as well as professionally qualified editors and proofreaders. Our vision is to help new voices break out. Imagine if we could pay our contributors too! 
If we can generate money from our anthologies then we can continue to keep the magazine as free and also reward people for contributing. 
We have created three new anthologies with published and unpublished authors, from an open submissions period, and now we want to introduce them to the world:
Former Heroes

Former Heroes includes stories by David Gullen, Gaie Sebold, Andrew Goodman, Jim King, Kate Charles, Peter Sutton and Sara Jayne Townsend.
Have you ever wondered what happens to heroes once they stop being heroes? Then you need to read this book to see how real life heroes, heroic buildings, starfarers and super heroes cope with no longer being heroes.
Forever Hungry


Do like brains? Do you like munching into their gooey goodness, do you salivate at the thought of getting your hands deep inside the cranium and stuffing that grey matter into your ever-chomping jaw? Do you, in fact, like Braaaains!? If so then this book is for you. Over 20 stories of the shambling undead for your pleasure.
Fantastically Horny

Do you want your erotica to explore new worlds and new species? Do you want to read sexy sci-fi  or fantasy with added, er fantasy? Then this book is for you, a collection of tales to titillate and tease. Find out what those aliens, robots, dragons and centaurs get up to in the bedroom.
 What We Need & What You Get


Consider this campaign a pre-order for the books we will be launching with. 
We want to make these books the best we can make them but our top priority is to publish them. 

We are looking for money to:


Publish anthologies, which we will then sell to raise money to pay contributors.
To pay the staff who have worked hard for only the reward of helping new writers.
To pay our artists, typesetter, editors and most of all the writers - there is nothing quite like the feeling of being paid for a piece of writing, and we'd like to make that dream come true for new writers.

Do you like Zombies? Then pledge for Forever Hungry.

Do you sexy tales? Then pledge for Fantastically Horny.
Ever wonder what happens to heroes when they stop being heroes? Then pledge for Former Heroes. We'll be using IngramSpark and need a minimum amount to pay for overheads like ISBNs and fees.
Our next priority is paying our contributors equally.
Our next priority after those two is paying the staff - artists, editors etc.
If we make more money than we expect then we will invest in future books and use in paying for contributors to the magazine.    The Impact Whilst it may now be easier to get your work out into the world with self-publishing, it can be hard to get it discovered. And even harder to make that next step and sell your work to a paying market, or even get a publishing deal.
Several of the authors that have had their work in the pages of Far Horizons have done just that. We can't promise success but we can help a writer improve their craft and give them vital editorial feedback.  You'll be helping us support new writers.
You'll be getting great stories and art.
You'll help us build a sustainable product and brand.
We are two years old as of April 2016 and feel ready to expand, please help us to do so!    Risks & Challenges  We have done our homework and hope to not run into problems, but we're fairly new in making books. We have a lot of experience on hitting deadlines though - you have to be to do a monthly magazine! But going via a publishing platform like IngramSpark will be a learning experience.

<p>I believe that the physicality of using films and processing and printing by my own hands brings my emotions into the fine prints the most. My images call for the self-awareness as well as the social awareness of human existence in a lonely way. I have become interested in taking pictures of people on the street from the distance to capture their natural behaviors and the feeling of separation and observation.</p>
<p>Coming from Japan where it has traditions and rules, I have been struggling to deal with my nationality and tradition versus being free in a different country and culture especially in the mixed cultures of New York City. I reflect this uneasy feeling in my current 3-year project of street photography. I sense that there are many people in this country or elsewhere feel the same way I feel. I would like to bring that awareness to the public.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Jamie Whitlow, I am a visual artist who has been creating art installations and murals for music festivals around the United States for the past four years.</p>
<p>The most recent project that I have been traveling with is named The Platonic Solids. The piece consists of five 5'-7' 3-dimensional geometric structures, created from PVC pipe and painted with light-reactive paint to make them glow in the dark. Building and displaying The Platonic Solids has been an extremely joyful and successful endeavor.</p>
<p>In observing the way that people interact with this installation, I have noticed that the nature of these shapes and the way they are built seem to call people to want to climb them. Because PVC is not a sustainable enough material to support this, I plan to recreate this project with steel, making each of the five shapes sturdy and large enough for people to climb and play on.</p>
<p>Successfully funding and building this project can help facilitate wonderful experiences to those who attend music festivals, by adding both aesthetic with this visual piece, and experience with its interactivity.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The total funding goal for this campaign is $2,500. This funding will go towards the following:</p>
<p>1. Makerspace Membership.</p>
<p>2. Steel. (Over 400 feet!)</p>
<p>3. Primer and light reactive spray paint.</p>
<p>4. Hardware- nuts, bolts, washers.</p>
<p>5. Transportation costs</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I truly feel as if creating art for others is not only my dream, but my purpose in life. Since I began building interactive installations two years ago, I have witnessed first hand the facilitation of joy and togetherness that they bring to festivals. Music festivals have been expanding to include more and more visual and interactive art. This project will help me build an even larger and more interactive piece than ever before, and continue following my passion of creating things that facilitate happiness.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Over the past few years, I have built some wonderful professional relationships with various festivals around the country. I have high hopes that I will return to many of these festivals in the upcoming season, specifically with this new and improved project.</p>
<p>While this is true, the process of displaying installations at festivals still requires an application process. I have spent the past several weeks applying and e-mailing over 50 festivals coming up in 2018. Although there are no specific events that I currently have booked with this project, I am currently waiting to hear back from all of these applications and contacts I have reached out to!</p>

That norm is, as it often is in our society, a norm based on thinness. Back in 2013, I posted an off-hand Facebook status confronting the fact that there were not enough avenues for fat models, especially when it came to nude photo shoots. The response from my community?<br/><br/>""Then do it.""</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>It was that simple. If the art didn't exist, then make it yourself. </p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>The Fat Naked Art Project prides itself on being a project that shoots fat and diverse bodies, and doing so at no cost to the models that pose for us. What this means for you is that we cannot do this without your help and support! In exchange, we create art that aims to make the invisible visible. Exposure breeds tolerance breeds love. We aim to make the world more body positive, one positive body at a time.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We are working on producing prints that we will give to donors at certain donation intervals and the more success we find with this campaign the more we would be able to and want to have an FNAP shoot in your city! If you donate $10 or more, I'll send you a hand written Thank You note on a post card from the city we're traveling to! </p>

</div></div>","How we got started In the world of photography and photographic art projects, there is an established norm - a norm which extends to all areas of photographic art involving people. That norm is, as it often is in our society, a norm based on thinness. Back in 2013, I posted an off-hand Facebook status confronting the fact that there were not enough avenues for fat models, especially when it came to nude photo shoots. The response from my community?""Then do it.""

It was that simple. If the art didn't exist, then make it yourself. 

3 years later and the Fat Naked Art Project has two blogs, a facebook page, and has traveled from our homebase in North Carolina up north to New York and plans to go all over the country with the help and support of our community worldwide!   What We Need & What You Get We need:
          - Venues (such as local studios to shoot at)
          - Lodging
          - Food
          - Transportation
          - Coverage for incidentals

<h2>The Farm</h2>
<p>The Purney family, originally from Western Pennsylvania, came to Nova Scotia in 1783 and was granted a stretch of land on the western branch of the Jordan river near the small town of Port Roseway, now Shelburne, on the Southwest Shore of the peninsula. They homesteaded this land from that year and until the early 21st century, for over two hundred years. Several of them are buried on the property. The Pletner family, upon purchasing the 70-acre farm in a state of decline in 2010, vowed to restore it to its former glory while paying homage to its original owners, the Purney’s. It is in their honor that the new forge will be named and it will be their indomitable pioneer spirit that will guide us in everything we do.</p>
<h2><strong>The Vision</strong></h2>
<p>Many artisan blade smiths prefer to work using only traditional tools and methods. Japanese sword makers often start with iron ore mined in the same place in Japan where it had been mined for millennia. While we admire this approach, we also feel that it puts handmade blades out of reach for most folks in North America. We plan to utilize a blend of modern and traditional materials, tools, and techniques to produce the highest quality handmade edged tools at prices that most folks can afford.</p>
<p>While we believe in turning a healthy profit, we pledge to keep our eyes firmly fixed first on our quality, our community, and our customers, and only thereafter on our bottom line. Our financial goal for the business is to provide stable income for the Graham and Pletner families and a place of apprenticeship for the young people of Shelburne County. We hope to be able to support the blade smithing community both locally and across North America.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>The Team</h2>
<p>Master Smith Randal Graham has been tinkering with metal his entire life and has been making blades of all kinds full-time for over a quarter of a century. Growing up on a farm in Nova Scotia, he was always aware of his Scottish ancestors’ famous frugality, emphasizing in his designs utility &amp; ruggedness over excessive artistic flourish.  </p>
</div><div>
<p>Dr. Baruch Pletner is a serial entrepreneur with advanced degrees in aerospace and business administration. He has been involved with edged weapons since he started fencing in Israel when he was only eleven years old. Since then Baruch kept up a keen interest in traditional edged weapons manufacturing, building relationships with Japanese traditional sword smiths among others. Baruch is a keen hunter, fisherman, and outdoorsman.</p>
<h2>Community Engagement</h2>
<p>Both Randal and Baruch are passionate about education and have engaged in mentoring and tutoring for most of their adult lives. We plan to partner with the community in Shelburne Municipality and Shelburne County to offer apprenticeships to students in the Shelburne and Lockeport regional high schools and in the Nova Scotia Community College, Shelburne Campus.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that we owe everything to the men and women of our military and law enforcement. As such, we plan to offer substantially reduced pricing on selected products for active duty and retired military and law enforcement members across North America. We will further have a slew of very special offerings for those members who have been wounded in the line of duty.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>Where Are We Now</h2>
<p>We are ready to get started. May of 2017 will be spent in setting up the forge and production will start in June.</p>
<h2>Our Commitment to Quality &amp; Functionality</h2>
<p>We are passionate about our products serving their function for as long as they are appreciated by their owners. When you buy one of our knives, you are getting a tool that can be in your family for generations. To show that we mean business, we offer a lifetime warranty on all our products. If your knife gets damaged as part of normal use, please send it to us and we'll send you a new one. As simple as that. Since we want you to use our knives in your daily life, we also offer a free sharpening &amp; reconditioning service. Send us your knife with a prepaid return label and we will recondition it to be like new. </p>
<h2>Our Initial Offerings</h2>
<p>Read this to find out which three knives we will make first as we ramp up production and focus on excellence in everything we do. Customized versions of these knives will be available to the patrons of this campaign in limited quantities.</p>
<h3>Classic Camp Knife</h3>
<p>We take our big knives exceedingly seriously. </p>
<p>We don't believe them to be replacements for axes - they are knives. Nor do we believe you can make a camp knife be like an ax without getting completely away from what a big knife should be or how it should be made.</p>
<p>Knives are cutting tools and our Classic Camp Knife follows this fundamental principle to the letter. Featuring a 10 inch (25 cm) blade with exhaustive attention given to balance and cross-section, coupled with heat treatment normally reserved for only the finest of custom knives, it is a tool that will help you create fire-lays, shelters, trails, and traps with ease and confidence.</p>
<p>And when it really counts...it'll see you through.</p>
<p>Like in all of our knives, the user interface, the handle, is as important as the blade...complete with a properly tapered and heat treated tang, the intelligently shaped handle features simple but strong and functional construction.  </p>
<p>So an ax replacement? No, we don't believe it should be thought of that way. But as an alternative; a lightweight, but capable tool for heavier tasks like firewood procurement or shelter building, or making your way through heavy brush on your big back-country hunt, we feel it's a sublime choice.</p>
<p>Some big game hunters have come to rely on these big campers for the initial prep required to pack out their large prize.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Scandinavian EDC (Every Day Carry)</h3>
<p>Our take on the centuries-old Nordic traditions of the working knife, our Scandinavian EDC is a full tang hard-working tool ready to take on whatever task you need it to accomplish.</p>
<p>Classic Nordic design, modern materials, and heat treatment combine to create a workhorse of a knife that's ideal for bushcrafting and survival, but is equally at home as a daily carry tool. Carry it in the shop, on a hike, or wherever your travels take you.</p>
<p>Full tang construction, fully sealed scales, and a 4 inch (10 cm) blade with a true ""scandi"" grind, along with the classic handle profile and cross section make the Scandinavian EDC a far more capable knife than its compact appearance would indicate. It carries lightly and discreetly, yet when called on to work hard and long, it's ready and able.</p>
<p>This knife has a long history as a proven hunting knife; use it to effortlessly prep and dress small and medium game, where it's trim and compact stature will prove a real bonus.</p>
<p>The Scandinavian EDC won't tire you out or weigh you down...it's ready to go whenever you are and wherever your adventures may lead you.</p>
<h3>Backwoods Utility</h3>
<p>Featuring a 3.5 inch (9 cm) blade with full flat V grind and convex secondary edge bevel, the Backwood's blade is thin, flexible, and scandalously sharp, ready to take on any task with ease; preparing a fire, cleaning fish and game, or in-camp crafting. </p>
<p>The Backwoods has a huge tang for it's class, embedded in an ergonomically shaped handle that provides sure and safe grip in many modes of utlization. You can tell the orientation of the blade by feel and the handle design allows using the knife in many different grips and positions for a wide range of tasks. </p>
<p>The Backwood is lightweight. Very much into ultralight territory, this knife begs to go along on your next through-hike or expedition where every ounce counts, without giving up true heavyweight performance and toughness.</p>
<p>If you are a backwoods minimalist, this is your knife, it was made for you. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Especially for You</h2>
<p>In exchange for being early adopters of our products and true believers in our vision, we offer special editions of our three startup knives. These one of a kind offerings will be hand-signed by Randal and include features that will not be repeated on any other knife we make. These knives will be one of a kind items that will never again be made in that exact form by our forge. These designs are just now being finished and we do not yet have pictures, but please stay tuned. Quantities are extremely limited and will not be increased as we will have to focus on production ramp-up and will not be able to offer customized blades at deeply discounted prices once our early adopter perks sell out. Please see the ""Initial Offerings"" section above for full descriptions of these one of a kind  products.</p>
<h2>Secret Perk</h2>
<p>Yes, there is something we are holding back for the true enthusiasts. No clues, but if you email us and tell us what makes you interested in blade smithing excellence, we will send you a link.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>Have experience with the outdoors? Passionate about hunting or fishing? A current or past member of the military or law enforcement? A great chef? Love edged weapons? Consider joining our advisory board! Send us a note and we'll get back to you.</p>

Master Smith Randal Graham has been tinkering with metal his entire life and has been making blades of all kinds full-time for over a quarter of a century. Growing up on a farm in Nova Scotia, he was always aware of his Scottish ancestors’ famous frugality, emphasizing in his designs utility & ruggedness over excessive artistic flourish.  

Dr. Baruch Pletner is a serial entrepreneur with advanced degrees in aerospace and business administration. He has been involved with edged weapons since he started fencing in Israel when he was only eleven years old. Since then Baruch kept up a keen interest in traditional edged weapons manufacturing, building relationships with Japanese traditional sword smiths among others. Baruch is a keen hunter, fisherman, and outdoorsman.
Community Engagement
Both Randal and Baruch are passionate about education and have engaged in mentoring and tutoring for most of their adult lives. We plan to partner with the community in Shelburne Municipality and Shelburne County to offer apprenticeships to students in the Shelburne and Lockeport regional high schools and in the Nova Scotia Community College, Shelburne Campus.
We firmly believe that we owe everything to the men and women of our military and law enforcement. As such, we plan to offer substantially reduced pricing on selected products for active duty and retired military and law enforcement members across North America. We will further have a slew of very special offerings for those members who have been wounded in the line of duty.

Where Are We Now
We are ready to get started. May of 2017 will be spent in setting up the forge and production will start in June.
Our Commitment to Quality & Functionality
We are passionate about our products serving their function for as long as they are appreciated by their owners. When you buy one of our knives, you are getting a tool that can be in your family for generations. To show that we mean business, we offer a lifetime warranty on all our products. If your knife gets damaged as part of normal use, please send it to us and we'll send you a new one. As simple as that. Since we want you to use our knives in your daily life, we also offer a free sharpening & reconditioning service. Send us your knife with a prepaid return label and we will recondition it to be like new. 
Our Initial Offerings
Read this to find out which three knives we will make first as we ramp up production and focus on excellence in everything we do. Customized versions of these knives will be available to the patrons of this campaign in limited quantities.
Classic Camp Knife
We take our big knives exceedingly seriously. 
We don't believe them to be replacements for axes - they are knives. Nor do we believe you can make a camp knife be like an ax without getting completely away from what a big knife should be or how it should be made.
Knives are cutting tools and our Classic Camp Knife follows this fundamental principle to the letter. Featuring a 10 inch (25 cm) blade with exhaustive attention given to balance and cross-section, coupled with heat treatment normally reserved for only the finest of custom knives, it is a tool that will help you create fire-lays, shelters, trails, and traps with ease and confidence.
And when it really counts...it'll see you through.
Like in all of our knives, the user interface, the handle, is as important as the blade...complete with a properly tapered and heat treated tang, the intelligently shaped handle features simple but strong and functional construction.  
So an ax replacement? No, we don't believe it should be thought of that way. But as an alternative; a lightweight, but capable tool for heavier tasks like firewood procurement or shelter building, or making your way through heavy brush on your big back-country hunt, we feel it's a sublime choice.
Some big game hunters have come to rely on these big campers for the initial prep required to pack out their large prize.
 
Scandinavian EDC (Every Day Carry)
Our take on the centuries-old Nordic traditions of the working knife, our Scandinavian EDC is a full tang hard-working tool ready to take on whatever task you need it to accomplish.
Classic Nordic design, modern materials, and heat treatment combine to create a workhorse of a knife that's ideal for bushcrafting and survival, but is equally at home as a daily carry tool. Carry it in the shop, on a hike, or wherever your travels take you.
Full tang construction, fully sealed scales, and a 4 inch (10 cm) blade with a true ""scandi"" grind, along with the classic handle profile and cross section make the Scandinavian EDC a far more capable knife than its compact appearance would indicate. It carries lightly and discreetly, yet when called on to work hard and long, it's ready and able.
This knife has a long history as a proven hunting knife; use it to effortlessly prep and dress small and medium game, where it's trim and compact stature will prove a real bonus.
The Scandinavian EDC won't tire you out or weigh you down...it's ready to go whenever you are and wherever your adventures may lead you.
Backwoods Utility
Featuring a 3.5 inch (9 cm) blade with full flat V grind and convex secondary edge bevel, the Backwood's blade is thin, flexible, and scandalously sharp, ready to take on any task with ease; preparing a fire, cleaning fish and game, or in-camp crafting. 
The Backwoods has a huge tang for it's class, embedded in an ergonomically shaped handle that provides sure and safe grip in many modes of utlization. You can tell the orientation of the blade by feel and the handle design allows using the knife in many different grips and positions for a wide range of tasks. 
The Backwood is lightweight. Very much into ultralight territory, this knife begs to go along on your next through-hike or expedition where every ounce counts, without giving up true heavyweight performance and toughness.
If you are a backwoods minimalist, this is your knife, it was made for you. 
 
Especially for You
In exchange for being early adopters of our products and true believers in our vision, we offer special editions of our three startup knives. These one of a kind offerings will be hand-signed by Randal and include features that will not be repeated on any other knife we make. These knives will be one of a kind items that will never again be made in that exact form by our forge. These designs are just now being finished and we do not yet have pictures, but please stay tuned. Quantities are extremely limited and will not be increased as we will have to focus on production ramp-up and will not be able to offer customized blades at deeply discounted prices once our early adopter perks sell out. Please see the ""Initial Offerings"" section above for full descriptions of these one of a kind  products.
Secret Perk
Yes, there is something we are holding back for the true enthusiasts. No clues, but if you email us and tell us what makes you interested in blade smithing excellence, we will send you a link.

<p>▐  <strong>Premesse</strong><br/><br/>La FESTA DI TEATRO ECOLOGICO a STROMBOLI (ME) è una manifestazione di teatro, musica, danza e altri incontri proposti alla luce del ""sole e l'altre stelle"", rigorosamente a spina staccata, senza utilizzare la corrente elettrica per l'illuminazione o l'amplificazione. <br/>Un’isola sull’isola: isola di disinquinamento acustico e di incontro senza filtri tecnologici con le antiche arti della musica, della danza e della parola ad alta voce, dove si esalta la presenza umana, dell'artista e del pubblico, nella performance dal vivo.

Un invito, per artisti e pubblico, a riscoprire le antiche arti del teatro, della musica e della danza in una relazione immediata tra pubblico e performer, illuminati dalla stessa luce e senza il filtro di effetti speciali che dipendano dalla corrente elettrica.</p>
<p>La Festa di Teatro EcoLogico a Stromboli quest'anno si svilupperà a partire dall'anniversario della nascita di Henry David Thoreau (luglio 1817), un uomo molto speciale noto soprattutto per i due anni trascorsi a vivere in una capanna in riva a un lago (raccontati in ""Walden"") e per ""Disobbedienza Civile"", in cui sostiene il diritto del cittadino a non obbedire se non è d'accordo con le direttive del governo (in questo caso si trattava della guerra contro il Messico).</p>
<p>▐  <strong>Foreword</strong><br/> </p>
<p>STROMBOLI UNPLUGGED THEATRE FESTIVAL (Sicily) is an event based on theatre, music, dance and other encounters that take place under “the light of the sun and the other stars” (quoting Dante), in today’s words, “totally unplugged” as it does not rely on the use of electricity or amplification on stage. </p>
<p>This festival will be an island on an island, free from acoustical pollution and technological filters, hosting live performances of music, dance and words spoken out loud, where the human connection between artists and audience is fundamental. It is an energy-conscious initiative, with performers striving to use electricity only when strictly necessary. Viewers and performers are invited to re-discover the timeless arts of theatre, music and dance by establishing a direct and unfiltered relationship, illuminated by the same light, unsupported by any special effects or electric device.</p>
<p>This year, the Eco Logic Theatre Festival in Stromboli will unfold from the celebration of the anniversary of the birth of Henry David Thoreau (July 1817), an original personality especially known for his reflections on the two years he lived in a hut on a lake (“Walden”) and for “Civil Disobedience,” an essay in which he argues that it is a citizen’s right to not obey if he disagrees with the government’s directives (in this case his argument was addressed to the war against Mexico).</p>
<p>▐ <strong>Di cosa parlerà la Festa di Teatro Ecologico 2017</strong></p>
<p>Questa edizione si chiamerà THE BODY ELECTRIC, dal celebre verso d'una poesia di Walt Whitman, il poeta del Trascendentalismo.  Il nostro interesse è quello di porre un focus sulla figura di H. D. Thoreau: personaggio inquieto e ricco di sollecitazioni, come tutto il movimento del Trascendentalismo Americano con cui dialoga. Adorato da molti, detestato da altri, a noi il suo pensiero e la sua esperienza ci sembrano ancora molto vivi e attuali.<br/>Il nostro intento è quello di creare un evento che celebri i duecento anni trascorsi dalla sua nascita!</p>
<p>Così abbiamo immaginato una Festa in cui invitare il pubblico all’ascolto delle parole di Louisa May Alcott, Emerson, Platone, Ovidio… amici e autori cari a Thoreau.</p>
<p>▐  <strong>What will the Eco Logic Theatre Festival 2017 be centered on?</strong></p>
<p>This edition will be called THE BODY ELECTRIC, a title taken from the celebrated verse of a poem by Walt Whitman, one of the key poets of American Transcendentalism. We will particularly focus on the personality of H. D. Thoreau, a restless and inspirational character who reflected the characteristics of the philosophical movement. Able to inspire equal sentiments of adoration and loath, Thoreau’s philosophy and adventures are still vivid and topical, and certainly worthy of celebration on the occasion of his bicentennial anniversary. Our audience will be listening to the words of Louisa May Alcott, Emerson, Plato, Ovid… all of Thoreau’s dear friends and beloved authors.</p>
<p>▐ <strong>Obiettivi</strong></p>
<p>La nostra Festa, come ha sottolineato una volta Nadia Fusini (scrittrice, critica letteraria e traduttrice italiana), vuole mettere in gioco l’antico rapporto fra arte e natura e cercare tra eco (ambiente) e logos (il linguaggio dell’arte) un dialogo di mutuo arricchimento.</p>
<p>Quest’anno siamo partiti dalla ricorrenza dei 200 anni dalla nascita di Henry David Thoreau, per elaborare, intorno al suo compleanno, una rete di incontri, pensieri, parole e musica che in cerchi concentrici si aprano ad figure chiave del Trascendentalismo Americano – da Emerson a Whitman a Melville a Margaret Fuller a Luisa May Alcott – muovendosi avanti e indietro nel tempo (da Platone a Chris McCandless) per toccare magari anche Hafez e Pavese, la musica di Charles Ives e il Bebop, Abraham Lincoln e la Guerra di Secessione, l’abolizionismo, l’indipendenza della donna, la relazione fra Natura e tanto altro.</p>
<p> E naturalmente ascoltare (o riascoltare) le parole di Thoreau in “Disobbedienza Civile”, un testo che risuona oggi in modo inquietante e pressante.</p>
<p>Ecco il perché della nostra volontà di festeggiare il compleanno di Thoreau, per avere la possibilità di creare un banchetto in cui voci dal passato e dal presente possano confrontarsi</p>
<p>▐ <strong>Goals</strong></p>
<p>Nadia Fusini (Italian writer, literary critic and translator) once highlighted that our festival enacts the timeless relationship between art and nature, and aims at finding a dialogue between the eco (environment) and the logos (the language of the arts) to achieve mutual enrichment.</p>
<p>This year we celebrate the bicentennial anniversary of Henry David Thoreau’s birth to explore a network of meetings, thoughts, words and musical pieces that, like imaginary concentric circles, feature the key players of American Transcendentalism – from Emerson to Whitman, from Melville to Margaret Fuller and Louisa May Alcott – moving forward and backward in time (from Plato to Chris McCandless) to reach Hafez and Pavese, Charles Ives’ music and Bebop, Abraham Lincoln and the American Civil War, abolitionism, the women’s rights’ movement, the relationship between Man and Nature, to name a few. And of course, we will hear Thoreau’s words in “Civil Disobedience,” a text that still produces a strong and disquieting echo.</p>
<p>Thoreau’s birthday will be an opportunity to create a “banquet” where past and present voices can find common ground.</p>
<p>▐ <strong>Perché fare un crowdfunding per la Festa di Teatro Ecologico?</strong></p>
<p>Pensare alla Festa va oltre la semplice visione di un festival: è un evento fatto in collettività, in cui la quarta parete tra spettatore e artista è abbattuta dall’incredibile forza della natura in cui la performance ha luogo.  Ecco perché vogliamo rivolgerci a una campagna crowdfunding. Tutti gli eventi della Festa sono a ingresso gratuito e l'organizzazione e gli artisti offrono gratuitamente il loro lavoro. Anche il pubblico può attivamente partecipare alla realizzazione della Festa, con donazioni che aiutino organizzazione e artisti a sostenere le spese del ""banchetto"": viaggi, alloggi, strutture. In questo modo ogni spettatore sarà attivo creatore della Festa insieme a noi!</p>
<p>▐ <strong>Why launch a crowdfunding for the STROMBOLI UNPLUGGED THEATRE FESTIVAL?</strong></p>
<p>Our event goes beyond the concept of a festival: it is a party, grounded in community, where the fourth wall between audiences and artists is broken down by the incredible force of the natural setting in which the performances take place.  This is why we want to launch a crowdfunding campaign. All the events featured in our Feast are free of charge and the artists as well as the organization are willing to offer their work for free. Moreover, the audience can actively take part in the festival by donating, which helps to cover the “banquet” expenses: travel, accommodations, and facilities. In this way viewers will be able to actively join us in the creation of the festival!</p>

Quest’anno siamo partiti dalla ricorrenza dei 200 anni dalla nascita di Henry David Thoreau, per elaborare, intorno al suo compleanno, una rete di incontri, pensieri, parole e musica che in cerchi concentrici si aprano ad figure chiave del Trascendentalismo Americano – da Emerson a Whitman a Melville a Margaret Fuller a Luisa May Alcott – muovendosi avanti e indietro nel tempo (da Platone a Chris McCandless) per toccare magari anche Hafez e Pavese, la musica di Charles Ives e il Bebop, Abraham Lincoln e la Guerra di Secessione, l’abolizionismo, l’indipendenza della donna, la relazione fra Natura e tanto altro.
 E naturalmente ascoltare (o riascoltare) le parole di Thoreau in “Disobbedienza Civile”, un testo che risuona oggi in modo inquietante e pressante.
Ecco il perché della nostra volontà di festeggiare il compleanno di Thoreau, per avere la possibilità di creare un banchetto in cui voci dal passato e dal presente possano confrontarsi
▐ Goals
Nadia Fusini (Italian writer, literary critic and translator) once highlighted that our festival enacts the timeless relationship between art and nature, and aims at finding a dialogue between the eco (environment) and the logos (the language of the arts) to achieve mutual enrichment.
This year we celebrate the bicentennial anniversary of Henry David Thoreau’s birth to explore a network of meetings, thoughts, words and musical pieces that, like imaginary concentric circles, feature the key players of American Transcendentalism – from Emerson to Whitman, from Melville to Margaret Fuller and Louisa May Alcott – moving forward and backward in time (from Plato to Chris McCandless) to reach Hafez and Pavese, Charles Ives’ music and Bebop, Abraham Lincoln and the American Civil War, abolitionism, the women’s rights’ movement, the relationship between Man and Nature, to name a few. And of course, we will hear Thoreau’s words in “Civil Disobedience,” a text that still produces a strong and disquieting echo.
Thoreau’s birthday will be an opportunity to create a “banquet” where past and present voices can find common ground.
▐ Perché fare un crowdfunding per la Festa di Teatro Ecologico?
Pensare alla Festa va oltre la semplice visione di un festival: è un evento fatto in collettività, in cui la quarta parete tra spettatore e artista è abbattuta dall’incredibile forza della natura in cui la performance ha luogo.  Ecco perché vogliamo rivolgerci a una campagna crowdfunding. Tutti gli eventi della Festa sono a ingresso gratuito e l'organizzazione e gli artisti offrono gratuitamente il loro lavoro. Anche il pubblico può attivamente partecipare alla realizzazione della Festa, con donazioni che aiutino organizzazione e artisti a sostenere le spese del ""banchetto"": viaggi, alloggi, strutture. In questo modo ogni spettatore sarà attivo creatore della Festa insieme a noi!
▐ Why launch a crowdfunding for the STROMBOLI UNPLUGGED THEATRE FESTIVAL?
Our event goes beyond the concept of a festival: it is a party, grounded in community, where the fourth wall between audiences and artists is broken down by the incredible force of the natural setting in which the performances take place.  This is why we want to launch a crowdfunding campaign. All the events featured in our Feast are free of charge and the artists as well as the organization are willing to offer their work for free. Moreover, the audience can actively take part in the festival by donating, which helps to cover the “banquet” expenses: travel, accommodations, and facilities. In this way viewers will be able to actively join us in the creation of the festival!

He was the founder of the acclaimed fanzine ‘The Frame’ and worked with Jon Pertwee on his autobiography ‘I Am The Doctor!’.</p><p>“Ever since I first saw ‘Doctor Who’ in the mid 1960’s, I was a confirmed fan,” explains David. “In addition, I have been collecting merchandise, original artwork, costumes from the show and props for most of my life.”</p><p>David is probably the owner of the largest ‘Doctor Who’ merchandise and ephemera collection in the world, with many thousands of items collected and preserved. His dream has always been to have a private museum to display the collection so that he and others can fully enjoy his lifetime’s passion.</p><p>“If you contribute to this campaign, you allow me to achieve his dream. It will also mean that all of these magnificent pieces can be shared with other people instead of being packed away in boxes and file cabinets. Which is always something I have always wanted to do.”</p><p>One of the major issues in mounting such an endeavour is where to host it. Over the years, David has made approaches to country houses and museums to see if they might be interested, but every time they have not. Therefore, realising that the only sure way of achieving this was to have his own premises in which to host it, David managed to find and buy a business unit two years ago to help make his vision a reality. THIS IS LOCATED IN RURAL LINCOLNSHIRE. (JUST OUTSIDE OF SLEAFORD).</p><p>“With the premises there and owned by me, the possibility of seeing this happen was much closer,” explains David. “The plan was always to adapt the building, and make it a suitable home for the collection.”</p><p>Unfortunately David unexpectedly suffered a major heart attack in May 2015, which meant that he was unable to work for several months, and since then work has been hard to find. So of course, with no income, work and plans on the Museum ground to a halt. At this point, the financial constraints make David’s dream seem like an impossible venture.</p><p>“Without the finances to finish this project, I may never see my collection displayed in the way I always wanted. I think this would be a terrible shame. I want people to see it. I want to share it. I also want to be able to see my lifelong ambition become a reality.”</p><p>David can’t do this alone. But you can help to make this vision a reality.</p><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p>Unfortunately we need a lot of money!</p><p><strong>Our contribution to the campaign</strong>:</p><p>In 2014 we bought a business unit which is around 3360 square feet. So far we have invested almost £50,000 which includes the cost of the premises, a new roof last year (£7000) and some doors and windows were replaced too. And it goes without saying that the collection of merchandise has cost David a uncaluable amount of financial commitment over the years.</p><p><strong>What we need help with and why</strong>:</p><p><strong>Levelling the floor: </strong>There are foot-deep pits cut into the floor of the business unit that need to be filled. As well as that the whole floor needs to be levelled. This doesn’t come cheap. The quotes we have at the moment fall around £10,000 (but we may be able to sort this for less). Who knew that concrete and flooring could be so expensive!</p><p><strong>Insulation and Decor:</strong> the walls are currently all just single layer breeze block, and the roof is a double-layer metal sheeting. As mentioned above, we have already replaced the external roof, however, proper insulation to protect the collection will need to be added to all of the wall and ceiling space, as well as boarding out the entire space, finishing and painting. This is estimated to cost around £5000.</p><p><strong>Electrics: </strong>Our lowest quote to put in new wiring, plug sockets and lighting as and where needed to best display and illuminate the items will be around £3500 (but we can try and scale back initially, and then add to it as further funds become available).</p><p><strong>External Groundworks: </strong>We need a French Drain installing down one side of the building (30 metres), and drainage gullies cutting to route rainwater from the roof away from the building. Then there’s a large drainage ditch to be created down the side of the building too, and then all the soil and waste needs to be removed from the site. This is estimated at around £5000 - £8000 depending on the amount of waste to be removed.</p><p><strong>That’s 23,500 so far!</strong> <i>What’s the rest for??</i></p><p><strong>Fixtures and fittings</strong> AND <strong>Improved security</strong>: Cabinets, bookcases and display plinths to safely display the collection … Plus some new large UPVC doors (which are £1000 each) for the front and interior of the building … the number of things needed is quite large! Again these could be scaled back and added as and when we have funds ...</p><p>If this is to be done at all, it needs to be done properly.  So we have a conservative estimate of £30,000 to get it all sorted out.</p><p><strong>WHAT YOU GET IF YOU HELP! </strong></p><p>Hold on to your hats because we have a whole list of fantastic perks that any ‘Doctor Who’ Fan would love to have.</p><p>Perk 1 - Donation of any amount will get you a personal shout out on Facebook and Twitter from David Howe.</p><p>Perk 2 - I WANT TO HELP.

Keep looking!</p><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><p>I am sure you already realise how important this private museum could be to help showcase a huge chunk of ‘Doctor Who’ history, something that has never been done before. There have been displays of merchandise at some of the official ‘Doctor Who’ exhibitions, but nothing on this scale, and nothing permanent, which can grow as the years pass.</p><p>We hope to allow others to make use of the museum space for product launches, and to hold limited-attendance open days with guests … Once it’s all up and running, we hope it will become somewhere which can be visited (with prior arrangement) and which forms an important part in the documentation and preservation of the show’s unique history and cultural impact. It is certainly a place where the merchandise history will be well represented – for the very first time.</p><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>The only risk here is that if we don’t reach our goal then the project could be delayed. That’s why we need your help to make this work.</p><p>We promise to make regular updates during the campaign as well as during the construction work as it happens.</p><p>At this time we don’t know when this work will be complete, but our aim is to have the museum up and running within one year of the end of the campaign. Which we feel is realistic if we achieve all of the budget. (<strong>Aiming for Summer 2018 for the Sponsor's open day</strong>)</p><p>As the campaign progresses, and we know how much money is in we will be making arrangements with the builders to begin as soon as possible. We will then have a clear view of when this will be ready.</p><p><strong>What happens if you don’t get enough money?</strong></p><p>Firstly, there are some things we could do without which aren't absolutely essential and so we can stretch the budget to get us there in the event that we don’t get all of the money, however, we want this to be as good as it possibly can be. For example we may have to forego the TARDIS entrance, and the new UPVC doors. Money may not stretch to making the reception area as nice as we would like it be – but the museum aspect would have priority.</p><p>We are also in talks with a private sponsor who is willing to consider helping if we make most of the target. So – it’s important to raise as much as possible to make this happen! And if we do make the target, they may invest to put in some extra surprises.</p><p>If the worst happens and far too little is raised we will refund everyone and we will take the hit on the indiegogo fees. (Obviously we don’t want this scenario to happen, so please do your best to help where you can!!). <strong>Any physical perks already fulfilled would NOT be subject to this refund.</strong></p><p><strong>AS A FOOTNOTE TO THIS - We are currently looking into other ways we can raise the money ourselves to ensure that the museum DOES happen and that all of your faith and confidence in the campaign is rewarded. </strong></p><p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p><p>Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help – so help us by sharing the campaign on pages and forums where you think like-minded people reside who might be able and interested.</p><p>So …</p><ul>
<li>Help us get the word out and make some noise about the campaign. This will only make it more likely for us to reach our goals.</li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools to make this easier.</li>
<li>Even giving £1 could help. If 30,000 people did that then we would get this money together easily.</li>

<p>Did you know that artists only get 40 to 50% of what an art gallery sells their work for? The rest is what the gallery takes for commission. The gallery also usually require exclusive rights to sell an artist’s work so even if the artist sells something themselves that was never shown there, they have to give the same 50 to 60% to the gallery.</p>
<p>I am an artist struggling to make a living in the very beginning stages of establishing my career. Because of these commissions, I have decided to first try marketing my work myself. I created an online art gallery, my first website build, SmallenStudios.com. I am very happy with what I was able to do, but the art market is a tough place to start a business and it takes more than a website. A lot more!</p>
<p>This crowdfunding campaign is raising money for the purchase of printing equipment that would allow me to produce top-of-the-line limited edition giclée fine art reproduction prints of my work. The best advertisement for your art is your art. Establishing one’s brand in the local art market is all about getting your work out in the world to be seen any where you can. These prints would give me the ability to show my work in far more locations, as well as offer a product at a much more affordable price, therefore broadening my customer base.</p>
<p>These prints are color matched perfectly to the originals and printed with a resolution of 1200 x 2400 dpi. They use pigment based ink instead of dye based ink so the colors do not fade for 100 – 200 years. These are the highest quality prints that modern commercial technology is capable of. They also enable the average middle-class person to enjoy my work in their own home, if they happen to find it to be of their taste.</p>
<p>The primary advantage of being able to print these myself is that I can print them on demand as people place orders for them, or as I find places to put them up for display. This would enable me to offer prints of all my work at the same time. To get a decent price at a print shop you would typically have to buy 100 – 200 of the same print. The cost of a 18 x 24 inch print would be about $40 - $50 each depending on paper choice. The same print would cost $10 (ink and paper) to produce myself with this equipment. Low end market prices for signed limited editions of this size start around $180. If I print them myself, sell them online myself, and because I am the artist signing them, my gross profit margin would be 1800%. Even through a gallery I would be almost at a 1000% gross profit margin. And this is at the lowest end of the price range.</p>

And that led to thinking of a series of numbers and the sounds of an island blending with the general noises of commerce.  The sounds on the track are all my own recordings using an iPhone. Some helpful choir members did the ‘numbers’ line.An Audio Portrait of the 2016 Lisbon Websummit The Audio Portrait was made onsite, and Includes interviews with leaders in technology as well as a variety of other voices on stage and off. Together with ambient sounds these create a lively audio portrait transporting the listener to the Lisbon 2016 Websummit as if there in person. The announcement that Trump had just been elected broke during the Websummit and keeps coming up in conversation.

<p>Last year, with a generous donation and a lot of hard work, we successfully launched our first ever Script to Screen program.  The goal was simple: create a local mentoring program for filmmakers of all ages, gender, race, background, and experience develop professional skills in a safe, real-world environment. It worked.  Beginners, novices, and professional filmmakers from across Whatcom and Skagit counties joined forces to collaborate in writing, shooting, and editing a short film that debuts on December 11th at the Pickford Film Center in Bellingham. While it’s time to celebrate our efforts, it’s also time to raise funds for the next round of Script to Screen.</p>
<p>This year Script to Screen functions as a shadow model.  Participants will be placed on teams under the tutelage of experienced professionals and given specific tasks in order to help the entire crew complete production by mid-February.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to execute another successful round of Script to Screen, we’re crowdfunding to raise $500. Most of this project is self-funded through participant fees, but we’re still going to need additional resources for special effects, consumable expenses (like tape and hard drives), location fees, catering for cast and crew, and other standard production expenses. Local professionals are donating time, equipment, and expertise, but we still have to raise money to make this program a reality.</p> <h3>Here’s a glimpse of what we’re offering our backers:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A special shout out on social media and thank you card</li>
<li>Your name in the credits as a supporter, and backer of Bellingham Film</li>
<li>Early access to the digital release of 2018’s short film</li>
</ul> <p>If we exceed our goal, additional funds will be used to cover festival submission fees and in support of future Script to Screen programs.  No one’s getting paid on this project; your donation will help a filmmaker develop professional skills.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Maybe you can’t support us financially, but you can help to get the word out.  Please “Share”, repost, and tell your friends. Additionally, we’re looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Available spaces where Script to Screen crew can conduct meetings in Whatcom county</li>
<li>Catering / food donations for set during filming</li>
<li>Participants.  If you’re interested in being part of the program, let us know</li>

<h3>art residency</h3>
<p>Throughout human history, artists were the ones to inspire changes, development and<br/>progress in every aspect of existence. Nowadays the audience for arts seems to be mainly<br/>artists themselves, their original role in society has drifted and art isn't accessible or<br/>intended for wider community.</p>
<p>The question is how to spread artistic circles for non-artists and encourage artists to use<br/>their creativity in a wider framework.</p>
<p>inspiring change is introducing a training course &amp; art residency which brings together emerging artists, art activists, cultural workers, youth workers &amp; art researchers from 8 countries of five continents, in Serbia, from 6th till 18th of August 2018</p>
<p>during the residency we will tackle following topics</p>
<ul>
<li>reconstructing the role of art in modern society</li>
<li>exploring the phenomena of socially engaged art</li>
<li>communicating the audience &amp; needs assessment of the community</li>
</ul>

<h3>we could use your help</h3>
<p>in order to realize a quality residency with greater impact, we need your support.</p>

<p>“I was part of Inspiring Change’s first residency in Turkey. As it was a young organisation, I didn’t know what to expect but decided to join nonetheless. The experience was very enriching. We were a very small team who very quickly managed to connect and together we decided what we wanted this residency to be about. Thanks to our different backgrounds and specialities, we were able to bring important skills together to work on our different career needs and teach each other. There I became an expert in looking for residencies and funding opportunities, and enhanced my aptitudes to build strong applications. Following from my time with Inspiring Change, I received 4 positive responses from residencies, 2 of which were the ones I really wanted to be part of. My motivation is now higher than ever and my projects are taking shape. I can only recommend to engage with this amazing organisation, which started with little means and grew quickly thanks to the perseverance and determination of its founder, who’s decided to make this a better world for artists of all kind.” – Valentine Emilia Bossert</p>

<p>Showcasing plant life from Botanical gardens, Chinese medicine, the Australian Outback, the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Zone of Alienation and the graves of lost children, the art in this book represents the hardy connections between plant and human.</p>
<h2>We have put together a book of art that we are proud of and are excited to get it out into the world.</h2>
<p>We've been told that print is dead and have learned that printing costs are high, but we love beautiful objects, so we've done it any way.  We promised to print and ship a copy to each artist involved... back when there were only 6 of us so the book was that much thinner. So many Ayatana artists have made amazing things with plants that the project has grown into a big publication that will be shipped out to a lot more artists. We also look forward to giving copies to the amazing scientists and naturalists who have helped us on our way. We've promised to print and ship 40 copies but they cost $25 each.  Ayatana is artist-run on a shoe string so we'd love your help to cover the printing and shipping costs.</p>
<p>  If we make more than we spend on this project we will give a scholarship to an artist to do an Ayatana research residency in Canada next year.</p>
<p>If we go over our goal we will send all of our backers a secret postal poem that's not in the perks.</p>
<p>If we go way over we will send every one a couple postal poems and some stickers to celebrate.</p>
<p>If we do not make our printing cost we will still send you your books.</p>
<h2>The Germinating Herbarium is the first issue of Ayatana's Annual Anthology.</h2>

</div></div>","Showcasing plant life from Botanical gardens, Chinese medicine, the Australian Outback, the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Zone of Alienation and the graves of lost children, the art in this book represents the hardy connections between plant and human.
We have put together a book of art that we are proud of and are excited to get it out into the world.
We've been told that print is dead and have learned that printing costs are high, but we love beautiful objects, so we've done it any way.  We promised to print and ship a copy to each artist involved... back when there were only 6 of us so the book was that much thinner. So many Ayatana artists have made amazing things with plants that the project has grown into a big publication that will be shipped out to a lot more artists. We also look forward to giving copies to the amazing scientists and naturalists who have helped us on our way. We've promised to print and ship 40 copies but they cost $25 each.  Ayatana is artist-run on a shoe string so we'd love your help to cover the printing and shipping costs.
  If we make more than we spend on this project we will give a scholarship to an artist to do an Ayatana research residency in Canada next year.
If we go over our goal we will send all of our backers a secret postal poem that's not in the perks.
If we go way over we will send every one a couple postal poems and some stickers to celebrate.
If we do not make our printing cost we will still send you your books.
The Germinating Herbarium is the first issue of Ayatana's Annual Anthology.
Each year we will showcase art working within a theme. This year's theme is plants.
Ayatana is a research program that leads international artists on intensive expeditions to study nature with scientists and experts from outside the art world.

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>The project is a QPOC-led zodiac photography and horoscope series combining Filipinx mythology with astrology!</p>
<p>The series will feature 12 pre-colonial Filipina goddesses represented by a diverse range of Filipina womxn and will be shot on location in Manila, Philippines in early March 2019. It will be released monthly on Hella Pinay, a digital magazine centering Filipina womxn, starting with the first zodiac sign, Aries, accompanied by original horoscopes and ritual.</p>
<p>We'll be representing goddesses from Filipinx mythology - such as Magwayen, the Visayan goddess of the sea and underworld; Lakapati, the transgender Tagalog goddess of fertility; and Mayari, the Tagalog goddess of the moon.</p>
<p>This is a collaboration between Stephanie Gancayco, founder &amp; EIC of Hella Pinay; art director &amp; stylist Jodinand Aguillon; and astrologer Chase Chualong of Early Bird Astrology.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: 700;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Who We Are</span></p>
<p>At Hella Pinay, we seek to create a space for positive representation of the diversity and complexity of Filipina womxn, and facilitate dialogue between Pinays in the Philippines and throughout the diaspora. Frustrated by the lack of representation of Filipinas in mainstream media, Hella Pinay was created as a platform for us to tell our own stories; a space for conversations on identity, decolonization, spirituality, creativity, and celebration of dope Pinay sh*t. Launched in December 2016, we've written dozens of articles, thrown WOC-centered events,  built a strong community of Filipinx followers around the globe, and have a stacked masthead of prominent writers, activists, artists, and healers in the Filipinx community from North America to the Philippines to Paris. Its founder, Stephanie Gancayco, is a creative director, designer, and medium based in Oakland, CA.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.jodinand.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jodinand Aguillon</a> is a Manila-based art director, stylist, and overall creative visionary who's helped shaped the neo-Filipino aesthetic. The images used in this campaign are actually from his first collaboration with Hella Pinay from two years ago entitled ""<a href=""https://www.jodinand.com/9muses"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">9 Muses</a>"" that were created as part of his arts residency at <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pineapplelabph/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pineapple Lab</a> in Manila. Inspired by the ""Siyam na Diwata ng Sining/Nine Muses of the Arts"" sculpture by Napoleon Abueva at UP Diliman and Goddess/Oracle cards, the series re-envisioned modern Muses as ""Diwata Cards"" which can be pulled for words of advice for those seeking inspiration. We shot and interviewed nine different Filipina creatives from the Philippines and North America who are each challenging societal limitations in their respective fields. You can see the interviews and images <a href=""https://www.hellapinay.com/blog?category=9%20Muses"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p>We will also be partnering with New York-based astrologer Chase Chualong of <a href=""https://www.earlybirdastrology.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Early Bird Astrology</a> to release monthly horoscopes and ritual to accompany the images. Chase believes that when used properly, astrology is a wonderful, practical tool that becomes a window into the soul and give us access to our deep potential. His work with astrology has created a container for the many subjects he's consistently studied for the past 8 years: traditional medicine, herbalism, spirituality, Buddhist thought, flower essences, energy work, massage, nutrition, health, beauty, food and magic. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Do We Need Funding?</h3>
<p>For the past two years, we've been doing it for the community and for the love and while that will always be at the heart of Hella Pinay's work, it's also been a major roadblock to putting out the kind of original content we want to (and also that we believe our audience deserves??).</p>
<p>The money we raise will allow us to compensate our talented team for their valuable labor and create beautiful representations of our precolonial goddesses (and the womxn depicting them). This is an ambitious project that requires research, props and costumes that represent the beauty of Philippine cultures and people, sourcing textiles which support Indigenous communities, location scouting and travel. We might even turn this into a print zine (or include it in our future planned print issues!), a gallery show, etc which requires more funding than we can provide out-of-pocket.</p>
<h3>What You Get!</h3>
<p>For those who've been asking us for the longest, we're finally going to be turning the 9 Muses series into a small oracle card deck that you can only get through donating to our Indiegogo campaign! You'll also be able to get prints from this zodiac series, Hella Pinay merch, and for the super super generous, a personalized chart reading from our astrologer Chase!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We believe it's super important to disrupt the traditional media landscape and create the reflections of ourselves that we want to see out in the world. To see people who look like us represented in an empowering, beautiful way positively impacts not just ourselves, but also the younger generations. We also aspire to share our precolonial mythology with our community (and beyond) and hopefully create an entry point for digging deeper into Filipinx spirituality. Much of the information on Filipinx mythology that exists isn't very easily accessible - at Hella Pinay we get constantly asked to point readers to resources. We're hoping to help change that narrative by documenting some of our heritage while also connecting it to our lived diasporic experience.</p>

<h2>We did it!!!! We've raised the funds needed to have ""Where There's Smoke"" at the Tribeca Film Festival via a mix of outside sources and crowdfunding.</h2>
<p>BIG THANKS to everyone who contributed and/or helped to spread the word about the project. Starting April 24th through May 5th we'll be running the experience within the festival's Virtual Arcade and also at a special storefront installation on Canal Street a few blocks away.</p>
<p>The storefront comes via a collaboration with Wallplay's OnCanal arts initiative. For more details visit <a href=""http://smokeproject.co"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://smokeproject.co</a></p>

<h2>In 1983 our van burst into flames on a family vacation. Eleven months later our house would burn to the ground.</h2>
<p>As I dig through my past I find mysterious connections to these blazes that force me to confront a closet full of skeletons. Inspired by true events in my life, <i>Where There’s Smoke</i> details these connections between two mysterious fires and my father’s battle with cancer.</p>
<p>This spring, <i>Where There’s Smoke</i> will premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival. The experience will consist of two distinct immersive installations: one in the festival’s main venue, and the other as a pop-up in a nearby storefront on Canal Street. Both installations will bring festival-goers into different sections of a house destroyed by fire.</p>
<p>After Tribeca, Where There’s Smoke will become a traveling installation designed to evoke empathy among healthcare practitioners in an effort to reduce intern burnout. Working in conjunction with the Columbia University Narrative Medicine program and the School of the Arts’ Digital Storytelling Lab, the project will act as a curative space that enables practitioners, patients and loved ones to craft and share stories of healing. The goal is to evolve the project into a multi-year design research initiative that harnesses storytelling, collaborative design and emergent technology in an effort to improve care.</p>
<h2>We need your help to create an empathic healing/learning experience that can tour multiple cities — starting with a storefront pop-up installation on Canal Street during the Tribeca Film Festival. </h2>
<h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551665247/dqk5ezztflrvr0jgg7am.png"" src=""""/></h2>
<h2>In Brief: Why should I support the project?</h2>
<p>1. When my dad was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer, the lack of empathy he received was heartbreaking. The careless treatment he suffered has driven me to create this experience as part of a grieving process. This work holds space for others to process loss and explore their own memories through a series of emotional artifacts that are enchanted via emergent technology.</p>
<p>2. <i>Where There's Smoke</i> represents a new form and function of storytelling. It’s a doc meets immersive theatre meets escape room, as well as an empathic space for healing. We did a work-in-progress staging at the invitational Future of Storytelling Summit and the response was overwhelming.</p>
<p>3. The immersive story installation created for Tribeca will also be able to travel to other locations. We're in talks with hospitals, museums and other festivals to stage Where There's Smoke in 2019 and 2020.</p>4. Work like this is difficult to fund as it doesn't fit into traditional formats. While the work is exciting on its own, projects like this also help to forge new paths for the curation, funding and exhibition of immersive work.<br/><br/>5.  We need $65,000 to realize the Tribeca offsite and to create a traveling set that will hit the road in 2019 and 2020. The physical and technical build-out is extensive and we've made sure to place value on those who are making the project a reality with their talents and time.<br/> <p>6.  The tech behind this experience will be documented and shared openly for others who wish to build their own immersive story installations with emergent technology.</p>
<p>7.  We've assembled an amazing group of collaborators - the Tribeca Film Festival, Columbia University's Narrative Medicine program, the Columbia University School of the Arts' Digital Storytelling Lab and Wallplay/On Canal to name a few.</p>

<p>The following is based on true events</p>
<h2>An Obsession with Fire</h2>
<p>Since I was a child, my Dad had always been an enigma. For over 20 years he put his life on the line as a volunteer firefighter and amateur fire scene photographer shooting thousands of scenes and objects in various states of burning. He spent his nights off listening to fire scanners, chasing blazes from dusk to dawn.</p>
<p>I grew up in a culture of fire parades, pancake breakfasts, and beef and beers. My family had evacuation plans, my brothers and I knew how to check doors for backdrafts and we were all well versed in the art of stop, drop and roll. Yet fire would intersect with our lives in strange and devastating ways multiple times throughout my youth.</p>
<p>In the months leading up to my Dad’s death, we had a series of in-depth conversations, finding our way through memories of experiences we shared. From the start, we both knew we were moving into uncharted territory. <i>Where </i><i>There’s</i><i> Smoke</i> shares our story in order to hold space for participants’ own memories. Participants work together to uncover nine narrative fragments that comprise the core of the experience, and in the process have an opportunity to connect to their own stories and each others’.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551656471/kktv6v0gdb7wpucxpyjz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>What's the audience experience</h2>
<p>Audience members take on the role of fire investigators as they move through the charred remains of a house while searching for a series of objects that survived a blaze. Once all the objects are found a 35mm slide projector and light table magically comes to life. By placing the objects in various combinations, audience members unlock a series of narrative fragments that reveal a mystery.</p>
<p> </p>

<i>Where </i><i>There’s</i><i> Smoke</i> crafts a unique experience that enables participants to explore their own memories through a series of emotional artifacts.</h2>

<h2>A Healing Space through Storytelling</h2>
<p>Through a mixture of storytelling, emergent technology and a collaborative design framework developed at Columbia University, <i>Where </i><i>There’s</i><i> Smoke</i> crafts a unique experience that enables participants to explore their own memories through a series of emotional artifacts. The result is an empathic space not easily accessible on our own or through everyday experiences.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551759007/huttowqwf4wdaiu082ft.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<div><h2>My Dad was terminal and given a year to live</h2></div>
<p>Even the walls looked sick — drab, washed out and orange. My Dad sat silently as my wife and I tried to make sense of the medical forms spread out in front of us. The forms had been copied so many times they were almost illegible.</p>
<p>After about thirty minutes the doctor finally arrived. From the moment she entered the room, she was rushed. She started by explaining that the cancer had spread from his colon to his liver to his lungs. The prognosis wasn’t good. My Dad was terminal – given a year to live.</p>
<p>He struggled with the fact that there was no cure. The more questions we asked, the more it seemed like the doctor was speaking a foreign language. We were talking past each other. In a moment of frustration, the doctor uttered a mere eight words that cut deep. They sting to this day. “I guess I’ll have to work through lunch,” she said, without looking up from her laptop.</p>
<p>The visit continued for another few minutes until the doctor started packing up her things, said goodbye and awkwardly left the room. In her wake, we attempted to pick up the emotional debris.</p>
<p>My Dad was a fighter. He lived much longer than expected. Over the course of two and a half years, he went through forty-five cycles of chemo until it made him so sick that he decided to walk away from treatment. To regain a degree of control over his life, he decided to take one last cross-country road trip with my Mom. When he returned from his trip we started collaborating on what would become <i>Where There’s Smoke</i>.</p>
<p>The lack of empathy my Dad experienced during his cancer diagnosis became a source of inspiration. During the final months of his life, we captured hours and hours of audio, sifted through thousands of archival slides, discussed plans for a physical set and chose some of his possessions to become enchanted game pieces at the center of the <i>Where There’s </i><i>Smoke</i><i> </i>experience.</p>
<h2>What people are saying about <i>Where There's Smoke</i>
</h2>
<p><i>The following is an audience members response after participating in a work-in-progress staging at the Future of Storytelling last fall. </i></p>
<p>“Not all transformations are visible, but 6 weeks since sitting down at a white table across from a complete stranger to start Lance Weiler’s immersive experience Where There’s Smoke I know this to be true: it is a truly transformative experience, in both visible and invisible ways… The experience encouraged immediate introspection and real empathy, both of which seem to be sorely lacking in our dialogue today. That introspection also prepared us to internalize an experience in which Lance and his family processed their complicated relationship with his dad, a firefighter, and the generational legacy of mysteries physical and spiritual left unsolved as cancer took his life. Where There’s Smoke is both deeply personal and universally true, as the best stories always are.“</p>

<h2> </h2>
<h2>The funds will help to create an installation that can travel to multiple locations</h2>
<p>The money raised will be used to design and build a traveling version of the set, to create a robust Internet of Things hardware/software control system with documentation (which we intend to openly share), to rent the storefront and to staff the installation for a month-long run. The total budget for the traveling set as well as staging the experience at the Tribeca Film Festival is $65,000</p>

</div><div> </div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","We did it!!!! We've raised the funds needed to have ""Where There's Smoke"" at the Tribeca Film Festival via a mix of outside sources and crowdfunding.
BIG THANKS to everyone who contributed and/or helped to spread the word about the project. Starting April 24th through May 5th we'll be running the experience within the festival's Virtual Arcade and also at a special storefront installation on Canal Street a few blocks away.
The storefront comes via a collaboration with Wallplay's OnCanal arts initiative. For more details visit http://smokeproject.co
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
In 1983 our van burst into flames on a family vacation. Eleven months later our house would burn to the ground.
As I dig through my past I find mysterious connections to these blazes that force me to confront a closet full of skeletons. Inspired by true events in my life, Where There’s Smoke details these connections between two mysterious fires and my father’s battle with cancer.
This spring, Where There’s Smoke will premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival. The experience will consist of two distinct immersive installations: one in the festival’s main venue, and the other as a pop-up in a nearby storefront on Canal Street. Both installations will bring festival-goers into different sections of a house destroyed by fire.
After Tribeca, Where There’s Smoke will become a traveling installation designed to evoke empathy among healthcare practitioners in an effort to reduce intern burnout. Working in conjunction with the Columbia University Narrative Medicine program and the School of the Arts’ Digital Storytelling Lab, the project will act as a curative space that enables practitioners, patients and loved ones to craft and share stories of healing. The goal is to evolve the project into a multi-year design research initiative that harnesses storytelling, collaborative design and emergent technology in an effort to improve care.
We need your help to create an empathic healing/learning experience that can tour multiple cities — starting with a storefront pop-up installation on Canal Street during the Tribeca Film Festival. 

In Brief: Why should I support the project?
1. When my dad was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer, the lack of empathy he received was heartbreaking. The careless treatment he suffered has driven me to create this experience as part of a grieving process. This work holds space for others to process loss and explore their own memories through a series of emotional artifacts that are enchanted via emergent technology.
2. Where There's Smoke represents a new form and function of storytelling. It’s a doc meets immersive theatre meets escape room, as well as an empathic space for healing. We did a work-in-progress staging at the invitational Future of Storytelling Summit and the response was overwhelming.
3. The immersive story installation created for Tribeca will also be able to travel to other locations. We're in talks with hospitals, museums and other festivals to stage Where There's Smoke in 2019 and 2020.4. Work like this is difficult to fund as it doesn't fit into traditional formats. While the work is exciting on its own, projects like this also help to forge new paths for the curation, funding and exhibition of immersive work.5.  We need $65,000 to realize the Tribeca offsite and to create a traveling set that will hit the road in 2019 and 2020. The physical and technical build-out is extensive and we've made sure to place value on those who are making the project a reality with their talents and time. 6.  The tech behind this experience will be documented and shared openly for others who wish to build their own immersive story installations with emergent technology.
7.  We've assembled an amazing group of collaborators - the Tribeca Film Festival, Columbia University's Narrative Medicine program, the Columbia University School of the Arts' Digital Storytelling Lab and Wallplay/On Canal to name a few.
 

The following is based on true events
An Obsession with Fire
Since I was a child, my Dad had always been an enigma. For over 20 years he put his life on the line as a volunteer firefighter and amateur fire scene photographer shooting thousands of scenes and objects in various states of burning. He spent his nights off listening to fire scanners, chasing blazes from dusk to dawn.
I grew up in a culture of fire parades, pancake breakfasts, and beef and beers. My family had evacuation plans, my brothers and I knew how to check doors for backdrafts and we were all well versed in the art of stop, drop and roll. Yet fire would intersect with our lives in strange and devastating ways multiple times throughout my youth.
In the months leading up to my Dad’s death, we had a series of in-depth conversations, finding our way through memories of experiences we shared. From the start, we both knew we were moving into uncharted territory. Where There’s Smoke shares our story in order to hold space for participants’ own memories. Participants work together to uncover nine narrative fragments that comprise the core of the experience, and in the process have an opportunity to connect to their own stories and each others’.

What's the audience experience
Audience members take on the role of fire investigators as they move through the charred remains of a house while searching for a series of objects that survived a blaze. Once all the objects are found a 35mm slide projector and light table magically comes to life. By placing the objects in various combinations, audience members unlock a series of narrative fragments that reveal a mystery.
 

Where There’s Smoke crafts a unique experience that enables participants to explore their own memories through a series of emotional artifacts.

 
The following video is an example of a narrative fragment unlocked by mixing and matching objects on the light table within the Where There’s Smoke installation.

 
A Healing Space through Storytelling
Through a mixture of storytelling, emergent technology and a collaborative design framework developed at Columbia University, Where There’s Smoke crafts a unique experience that enables participants to explore their own memories through a series of emotional artifacts. The result is an empathic space not easily accessible on our own or through everyday experiences.

My Dad was terminal and given a year to live
Even the walls looked sick — drab, washed out and orange. My Dad sat silently as my wife and I tried to make sense of the medical forms spread out in front of us. The forms had been copied so many times they were almost illegible.
After about thirty minutes the doctor finally arrived. From the moment she entered the room, she was rushed. She started by explaining that the cancer had spread from his colon to his liver to his lungs. The prognosis wasn’t good. My Dad was terminal – given a year to live.
He struggled with the fact that there was no cure. The more questions we asked, the more it seemed like the doctor was speaking a foreign language. We were talking past each other. In a moment of frustration, the doctor uttered a mere eight words that cut deep. They sting to this day. “I guess I’ll have to work through lunch,” she said, without looking up from her laptop.
The visit continued for another few minutes until the doctor started packing up her things, said goodbye and awkwardly left the room. In her wake, we attempted to pick up the emotional debris.
My Dad was a fighter. He lived much longer than expected. Over the course of two and a half years, he went through forty-five cycles of chemo until it made him so sick that he decided to walk away from treatment. To regain a degree of control over his life, he decided to take one last cross-country road trip with my Mom. When he returned from his trip we started collaborating on what would become Where There’s Smoke.
The lack of empathy my Dad experienced during his cancer diagnosis became a source of inspiration. During the final months of his life, we captured hours and hours of audio, sifted through thousands of archival slides, discussed plans for a physical set and chose some of his possessions to become enchanted game pieces at the center of the Where There’s Smoke experience.
What people are saying about Where There's Smoke

The following is an audience members response after participating in a work-in-progress staging at the Future of Storytelling last fall. 
“Not all transformations are visible, but 6 weeks since sitting down at a white table across from a complete stranger to start Lance Weiler’s immersive experience Where There’s Smoke I know this to be true: it is a truly transformative experience, in both visible and invisible ways… The experience encouraged immediate introspection and real empathy, both of which seem to be sorely lacking in our dialogue today. That introspection also prepared us to internalize an experience in which Lance and his family processed their complicated relationship with his dad, a firefighter, and the generational legacy of mysteries physical and spiritual left unsolved as cancer took his life. Where There’s Smoke is both deeply personal and universally true, as the best stories always are.“

 
The funds will help to create an installation that can travel to multiple locations
The money raised will be used to design and build a traveling version of the set, to create a robust Internet of Things hardware/software control system with documentation (which we intend to openly share), to rent the storefront and to staff the installation for a month-long run. The total budget for the traveling set as well as staging the experience at the Tribeca Film Festival is $65,000


 
What do I receive in return for my contribution?
First and foremost it is important to note that this project would not be possible without contributions from funders like you. Thank you so much for your time and consideration.

<p>""Joy is the highest energy of all. It is the magical sense that everything is possible. Joy springs from appreciating the gifts within each moment. Joy allows you to attract and create your present and future moments at their highest possible levels"" - Doreen Virtue</p>
<p>Imagine seeing a giant kitten playing with a ball of yarn as you start pedaling out into the open playa. From afar you can see she's made of wood and has a most ecstatic expression on her face. As you pedal closer you can see her skin is made up of carefully cut mosaic pieces.  At night the light pours through the spaces on the mosaic, illuminating her from the inside out.  It is evident that an entire community created this larger than life sculpture. As you start to explore the ball of yarn you notice a panel of buttons which pique your curiosity. You examine a button and press it, to your delight a purring sound emanates from the sculpture. At night the buttons light up and you find that when you press another button it changes the color of the lighting in the yarn. You can't help but feel the joy, curiosity, and playful energy this feline exudes. </p>
<p>The impact of this project is immeasurable because joy the driving force behind it's creation. Perhaps if we could put the feeling of joy in a pill, we would be able to cure the suffering of humanity. Instead, we’ll bring it in the form of a giant kitten playing with yarn.</p>

<p>While watching the Burning Man webcam incessantly last year, Rebecca decided she had to go back home. And she <u>must</u> make a sculpture with her community. She had an idea in mind for the piece and thought that if she could make it small, she could make it big.</p>
<p>Rebecca loves sculpting, she earned her BFA from MSUD in 2005 and hasn't stopped creating art since, albeit slowly due to a busy work life as an Associate Producer of Animation on The Simpsons. While she had confidence in the “making it small/making it big” part of things, she had even bigger confidence in her ability to recruit and lead talented people. Rebecca believes anything is possible with teamwork (and it's WAY more fun!) She called  her friend Adriane Dos Sontos (she’s a super talented fine detail sculptor) and asked her if she’d like to help make a maquette.</p>
<p>Adriane Dos Sontos always had a love for art throughout her life but didn't discover her talent until 4 years ago when she decided to pursue what has now become her passion. Not having the privilege of attending an art school and only having a few technique classes under her belt, she was forced to learn on her own and become a self-taught sculptor. After the first time of running her fingers through the clay and letting the magic of formation take place is when she knew this was her calling and fell in love with sculpting. Adriane felt called to help on this project because of the overriding message of joy and the opportunity to explore new media and techniques. </p>
<p>After about a month of hard work, the beautiful maquette was complete and Rebecca called Gentle Giant Studios to help with the 3D scan. Being Burners themselves, they were super excited to help on this project. Word spread in our community and all of a sudden, JoyCat 2019 had a couple of mentors. Things have been rolling along (with mighty persistence) ever since.</p>
<p>Currently the project is with Rbhu engineering making sure it won’t be knocked over in a wind storm or pulled down by a clueless climber.

<p>I am a circus performer with over 25 years experience performing all over the world. The above image is but a snippet of the productions I have both been involved with and created. </p>
<p>""The Drunken Sailors"" is one of my latest projects which culminated from working with my brother who has over 20 years experience as a musician. It involves our roving bike/boat/stage on which we perform sea shanties and circus tricks.</p>
<p>This campaign will get us to Europe. We want to expose this work to a larger audience so it seems the best way to do that is to take it to where the people are. Not only that, much of the music we sing has its origins in and around The Mediterranean Sea. What more appropriate place is there for us to be performing. </p>
<p>This adventure is the culmination of a lifetime of work, as well as the start of a new journey.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Funding for this trip will go towards these needs.</p>
<p>- International Travel</p>
<p>- In country Travel</p>
<p>- Accomodation</p>
<p>- Food</p>
<p>- General Costs (Communications, taxes, etc)</p>
<p>For three people and a 4 meter long craft this is no cheap exercise.</p>
<p>We are in this for the long haul. This is a project that I believe in so if we don't reach our target and can't get to Europe this year the funds will go directly into the vault and be ready for use next year when we hope to be touring through Europe. If contributions exceed our target the excess will go to like minded projects.</p>

I am a circus performer with over 25 years experience performing all over the world. The above image is but a snippet of the productions I have both been involved with and created. 
""The Drunken Sailors"" is one of my latest projects which culminated from working with my brother who has over 20 years experience as a musician. It involves our roving bike/boat/stage on which we perform sea shanties and circus tricks.
This campaign will get us to Europe. We want to expose this work to a larger audience so it seems the best way to do that is to take it to where the people are. Not only that, much of the music we sing has its origins in and around The Mediterranean Sea. What more appropriate place is there for us to be performing. 
This adventure is the culmination of a lifetime of work, as well as the start of a new journey.
 

What We Need & What You Get
Funding for this trip will go towards these needs.
- International Travel
- In country Travel
- Accomodation
- Food
- General Costs (Communications, taxes, etc)
For three people and a 4 meter long craft this is no cheap exercise.
We are in this for the long haul. This is a project that I believe in so if we don't reach our target and can't get to Europe this year the funds will go directly into the vault and be ready for use next year when we hope to be touring through Europe. If contributions exceed our target the excess will go to like minded projects.
This project has a strong cultural message. It reminds people of the art that came out of the blood and sweat of men from thousands of years of travel and work on the seas. It also crosses cultural boundaries. Sailing nations around the world had their own versions of sea shanties and influences on songs from different groups would drift in and out as they joined the long journeys on the sea. An important oral history which this project is endeavouring to tell the story of and continue.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Join us in this project initiated by Živi Atelje DK (<a href=""https://ziviatelje.dk/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Living Atelier DK</a>), where the past mingles with the future and transforms our present.</p>
<p>Our name, Living Atelier DK, tells it all <i>—</i> “Living,” ever adapting; “Atelier,” ever experimenting; and the initials “DK,” from the artist <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vera_Dajht-Kralj&amp;diff=850418812&amp;oldid=812381054"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vera Dajht-Kralj,</a> the spirit that continues to inspire.</p>
<p>After Vera left us in 2014, we started the art cooperative to honor her legacy and build on what she had developed in nearly 60 years of work in her art studio.</p>
<p>The art studio, her atelier, was always an open and welcoming place of creativity where artists, architects, craftsmen and women, writers, journalists and people from all walks of life and meridians of the globe came for a coffee or a “rakia” drink and conversation. Ideas were exchanged, and joint projects were imagined and developed.</p>
<p>This project – the first exhibition from the heritage collection and a book, specifically an art monograph –  is one more tangible step in the preservation and promotion of her artistic heritage and spirit.</p>
<p>Through your support, you join hands with a diverse group of people already working on the digitalization, cataloguing and preservation of Vera’s collection. So far, thanks almost exclusively to voluntary efforts and individual funds, members of the cooperative managed to catalogue over 2,000 units from this valuable collection and establish an <a href=""http://vdk.eindigo.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">on-line public repository</a> so that others can enjoy and benefit from Vera’s art.</p>
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vera_Dajht-Kralj&amp;diff=850418812&amp;oldid=812381054"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vera Dajht Kralj</a> (1928 – 2014) is one of the most important sculptresses of the second half of the 20th century in Croatia and the region. In 2015, her art was officially declared as part of the protected cultural heritage of Croatia.</p>
<p>Our work is not just a re-evaluation of Croatian and regional cultural heritage in the global context but also a re-evaluation of women in art, especially sculpture, one of the art disciplines where male sculptors dominated the scene for so long.</p>
<p>On the 3rd of October 2018, we will open the first major exhibition from her collection since her passing, entitled “Beyond Visible - Sculpture, Space and Memory: Public art and commemorative sculpture of Vera Dajht Kralj,” at the Croatian Museum of Architecture of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts (HAZU). As part of the exhibition, we will promote the monograph by the same name whose author, Ana Kršinić Lozica, is the curator of the collection and an art historian. She worked on this project with two students of art history and museology, Ana Marija Petričević and Anyla Kabashi, who have integrated their work on the collection to be part of their university thesis and who continue to be an indispensable part of the project.</p>
<p>As an independent non-profit art cooperative, we struggle with funds to make this project come through with the quality it deserves.</p>
<p>Your contribution will enable us to realize this first major goal of an exhibition and monograph. Any donation we collect above the needed amount will solely go toward the protection and restoration of art pieces in danger of degradation. We will also be working on creating virtual exhibitions to expand on the reach of Vera's art.</p>
<p>We invite you to join us now, in the present, and blend the future with the past. When you share in our efforts, you are supporting more than than just the exhibition and book – you also become part of the vision and allow activities at Living Atelier Dajht Kralj to live on.</p>
<p><strong style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>For this first step, to realize the exhibition, restore some of the art pieces included in the exhibition and prepare a 300-page bilingual (Croatian-English) comprehensive monograph, we need a total of 21,389  US dollars (136,080 kn). From the City of Zagreb, we secured 4 ,715 US dollars (30,000 kn) and another 1,572 US dollars (10,000 kn) from the Croatian Ministry of Culture.</p>
<p>The remaining 15,102 US dollars (96,080.80 kn) we are looking to collect from sponsors and donors.</p>
<p>Only now, after three years of continuous engagement, volunteering, enthusiasm and passion, we invite you to join in with your contributions. We are proud that we already have a lot to show from our efforts — the catalogued units from Vera's collection, a <a href=""http://vdk.eindigo.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">public repository</a>, and numerous other activities that you can see on our <a href=""http://www.ziviatelje.dk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">web page</a> and our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ziviateljedk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a> page.</p>
<p>As an appreciation for your gesture of support, as you will see in the PERKS section, we offer an array of valuable gifts, each with their own tale for you to share with those around you.</p>
<p>* Preorder a monograph at a discount.</p>
<p>* You can come for an exclusive concert by our honorary members and world class musicians <a href=""http://www.miroslavtadic.com/news.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Miroslav Tadić</a> and <a href=""https://www.yvetteholzwarth.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Yvette Holzwarth</a>.</p>
<p>* We are also releasing a limited edition of screen prints, including some signed by Vera herself.</p>
<p>* SPECIAL ** Become the owner of an original piece of Vera's art by choosing from a selection of her sculptures to cast in bronze. One bronze original is for you and the other for the collection.</p>
<p><i>— For this last offer please contact us directly, zbirkadajhtkralj@ziviatelje.dk, so we can discuss which sculpture you would be interested in saving from degradation. — </i></p>
<p>As Living Atelier Dajht Kralj is a place of diversity, we are sure you will find something that suits you perfectly among the perks on offer :-)</p>
<p><strong>The Future</strong></p>
<p>The impact of your contribution does not stop with the closing of the exhibition, it will live on through our preservation work and promotion of Vera's art by finishing the public repository and enabling other students or curators to work on different themes inspired by the collection.</p>
<p>The monograph is just one step in a vision that enables people to engage with one of many aspects of Vera's unique art. The virtual exhibitions we plan to do will set new standards for such exhibitions, reach a wider and younger public, and disseminate the main message of Vera's art <i>—</i> universal love.</p>
<p>In three years of existence, we gained more than 1,800 regular followers over Facebook (a significant number for our age and for where we operate) and we keep growing. Events in our small gallery space attract an average of 100 people per opening whether <a href=""http://ziviatelje.dk/en/gallery-dk/exhibitions/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hosting exhibitions at Gallery DK</a> for young artists graduating from the art academy across the street or more established and international artists.

People value your transparency. Be open and stand out by providing insight into the risks and obstacles you may face on the way to achieving your goal.

Because this is a very unique project, I expect that there will probably be unforeseen hurdles along the way. Because of this, a cushion fund of $500 will be apportioned 
Kelly has a HUGE backing of artist friends and family. As the President of the Tahoe Art League, Kelly has already received several volunteers for the project including world-famous artists and previous artists of large-scale Burning Man Projects.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.youmightdietomorrow.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">You Might Die Tomorrow</a> is an art project by Kate Manser to inspire the citizens of Black Rock City to live urgently, love openly, and enjoy your life. Remembering that we will die is the most powerful reminder to live while we're still alive.</p>
<p>The art installation is a 14' wide x 10' tall message in lights: YOU MIGHT DIE TOMORROW. The objective of this piece, tied to the 2018 theme, ""I Robot,"" is to remind the citizens of Black Rock City (and the world) that despite the rush and frightening evolution of technology, we humans are still absolutely, positively, completely mortal -- and for all the unknowns in the world, we might as well enjoy our lives while we're still here.</p>
<p>So many Burners come to BRC each year in search of a new way of living and a radical shift in perspective. Remembering that we are going to die is a profound and universally-accessible key to appreciating the here and now.</p>
<p>Studies show that when people are exposed to concepts of their mortality, we perform tasks better, are more creative, and value collectivism and the present more highly.</p>
<p>Our mortality is, unexpectedly, a source of joy, of motivation to live, and an inspiration to play. We have only now.</p>
<p>You might die tomorrow. So live today.</p>

<h3>About Kate</h3>
<p>I'm Kate Manser. Here's my story.</p>
<p>In 2013, my 27-year old Manager at Google and my 27-year old college friend died in unrelated, unexpected tragedies. It shocked and terrified me, and I developed a fear of death that began to take over my life: I would imagine getting hit as I crossed an intersection, envision how the phone call would go when I got the news that my mom died, and avoided taking any risks out of fear of the unknown. It completely clouded the beauty of life.</p>
<p>About a year later, my colleague and adventure idol and fellow Burner Dan Fredinburg was killed in the Nepal earthquake while climbing Mount Everest at 33 years old. As I struggled to make sense of the loss, I realized that he knew he might die climbing that mountain, but that he had to climb it to truly live.</p>
<p>In that moment, everything changed for me: I realized that I have absolutely no control over when or how I die -- but I have complete control over how I live until that mystery moment comes. All of the energy I spent on my fear of dying was instantly channeled instead into living every day like I might die tomorrow. </p>
<p>Since then, I have made radical shifts in my life to better align with my soul -- including quitting my job at Google, traveling around the world for two years, and writing a book about how thinking about your death makes life better -- but no shift has been as radical as my shift in perspective. I live urgently, love wildly, and am so grateful to be alive. </p>
<p>Life is beautiful.</p>

<p><b>Amo mio padre, ha speso tutta la sua vita per il Museo delle Maioliche Medievali e Rinascimentali Orvietane.</b></p><p>Ho deciso di organizzare una raccolta fondi<b> </b>perché amo mio padre e ho profonda stima per ciò in cui lui ha fortemente creduto: ha speso la sua vita intera e tutte le sue risorse, soprattutto economiche, per rendere visibili al pubblico suggestivi locali ipogei scavati nel tufo e una collezione di ceramica quasi interamente rinvenuta all'interno degli stessi, prodotta da una fornace medievale - rimasta pressoché intatta - e unica del Quattrocento esistente al mondo. Tutto questo lo ha fatto senza usufruire di nessun contributo pubblico.</p><p>Il Ministero dei Beni e delle Attività Culturali e del Turismo, attraverso la Soprintendenza per i Beni Architettonici e Paesaggistici dell'Umbria ha riconosciuto l'importanza dei 3000 pezzi della collezione e dei locali del Museo e con un decreto di notifica li ha vincolati (legando luogo di produzione e manufatti) e sottoposti a disposizione di tutela. Un riconoscimento importante dunque, che però non prevede erogazione di fondi.</p><p>Il prezzo del biglietto non è sufficiente per coprire i costi di gestione e di manutenzione del Museo che è quindi attualmente chiuso. Per me questo è inaccettabile: voglio credere di vivere in una Nazione che ama il proprio patrimonio artistico e culturale, e uno stato è formato prima di tutto dai suoi Cittadini e dunque è a loro che mi rivolgo, a tutti quegli appassionati d'arte e di storia che non si arrendono al triste destino di un'Italia che non crede abbastanza nella sua inesauribile Bellezza.</p><p>Chiunque può dare un piccolo contributo, anche di un euro: verrà ricompensato con una visita gratuita al Museo. Chi non può contribuire economicamente può - se vuole - aiutarmi a sostenere la causa spargendo la voce.</p><p>Voglio credere ancora nei sogni. E anche se a volte la tentazione di mollare è forte, penso sempre a un famoso proverbio: ""Non arrenderti: rischieresti di farlo un'ora prima del miracolo"".</p><p><b>Dicono di noi</b>:</p><p><b>""Un tesoro da salvare""</b> - <b>Vittorio Sgarbi - </b>Critico e storico dell'arte <br/></p><p>""Un patrimonio eccezionale, non solo per Orvieto, ma per tutta la storia della Ceramica italiana del Medioevo e del Rinascimento"" - <b>Timoty Wilson</b> - Professore d'arte presso l'Università di Oxford</p><p>""Questo Museo straordinario, per il suo carattere unico, dovrebbe essere considerato essenziale non solo per la città di Orvieto, ma per tutta l'umanità, e dovrebbe essere salvaguardato, e quindi sottoposto a tutela, conservazione e valorizzazione, come previsto dal Codice dei Beni Culturali"" -  <b>Luciano Frazzoni</b> - Direttore del Museo F. Rittatore Vonwiller, Farnese (VT)<br/></p><p>""Un patrimonio da salvare""<b> Antonella Frezzolini - </b>Studiosa di ceramica antica<b><br/></b></p><p><br/></p><p>La nostra pagina Facebook: <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/ceramicunderground.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.facebook.com/ceramicunderground.org</a></p><p>Il nostro sito internet: <a href=""http://www.ceramicunderground.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ceramicunderground.org</a></p><p>Ci trovate anche su Twitter: @ceramicundergr<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>I love my father, he has spent all his life for the Museum of Ceramics. </b><br/><br/>The Museum suffered a lack of government funding: over the years, the Museum has used its resources to make up the statal shortfall, and this has placed a tremendous strain on our budget.<br/><br/>The closure of the Museum means that it is wrong believing in art, history, culture,<br/>dreams? No, I still want to believe in dreams!<br/><br/>Closing the Museum would be depriving people access to education facilites so vital to our understanding of ceramic history of the whole world. I ask you to help me keep alive the dream of my father. His amazing Museum <b>can not close</b>!<br/></p><p><b>The museum carved out of tufa rock</b><br/></p><p>The Museum premises are
particularly inspiring and a remarkable attraction in themselves. Almost
entirely carved out of tufa rock, the Museum unveils archaeological structures
dating back to the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, such as a fifteenth-century
<b>kiln</b> for firing majolicas, which is <b>the only one existing</b> in Italy and,
possibly, <b>in the whole world</b>, and is almost intact.<span>  Furthermore, the kiln dumps can be seen too, as
well as the structure of a typical winekeeping cellar.</span>
</p><p>The majolicas are displayed
in glass cases fitted to old niches carved out of tufa rock; in some cases the
safety glasses have been directly fitted to the walls and wooden structures have
been provided for support.  </p>
<p>Both private clients and
public institutions have been borrowing the collection exhibits on occasions,
whether to make commercial copies or have the town represented in local,
national and international exhibitions respectively; furthermore, schools of
all grades, including Italian and foreign universities, have benefited from the
permanent exhibition for cultural visits and documentation, together with more
or less occasional visitors. <br/></p><p>It should not be overlooked
that, in spite of Orvieto being one of the most famous towns in Italy in the
tradition of ceramics, a local Museum specialized in this field had yet to be
created therefore it was necessary for someone to fulfil such a need.</p><p>Your funding will go <b>100%</b> towards helping to sustain the Museum.<b><br/></b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>About us</b></p><p><b>""A treasure to be saved"" -</b> <b>Vittorio Sgarbi</b> - The most important art critic in Italy<br/></p>
<span>""This is an exceptional heritage, not only for Orvieto, but throughout the history of Italian ceramics of the Middle Ages and Renaissance</span>"" <b>Timothy Wilson</b> - Professor of the Arts of the Renaissance at <em>Oxford</em> University<br/><br/>



""A heritage to be saved"" <b>Antonella Frazzolini</b><em> - Ancient ceramics researcher</em><br/><span><br/>
<p><b></b>""This extraordinary museum, for its unique character, should be considered essential not only for the city of Orvieto, but for all mankind, and should be safeguarded and therefore submitted to protection, conservation and enhancement, as required by the Code of Cultural Heritage"" <b>Luciano Frazzoni</b>

</div> <p>Thanks to all!<br/></p></div>","Amo mio padre, ha speso tutta la sua vita per il Museo delle Maioliche Medievali e Rinascimentali Orvietane.Ho deciso di organizzare una raccolta fondi perché amo mio padre e ho profonda stima per ciò in cui lui ha fortemente creduto: ha speso la sua vita intera e tutte le sue risorse, soprattutto economiche, per rendere visibili al pubblico suggestivi locali ipogei scavati nel tufo e una collezione di ceramica quasi interamente rinvenuta all'interno degli stessi, prodotta da una fornace medievale - rimasta pressoché intatta - e unica del Quattrocento esistente al mondo. Tutto questo lo ha fatto senza usufruire di nessun contributo pubblico.Il Ministero dei Beni e delle Attività Culturali e del Turismo, attraverso la Soprintendenza per i Beni Architettonici e Paesaggistici dell'Umbria ha riconosciuto l'importanza dei 3000 pezzi della collezione e dei locali del Museo e con un decreto di notifica li ha vincolati (legando luogo di produzione e manufatti) e sottoposti a disposizione di tutela. Un riconoscimento importante dunque, che però non prevede erogazione di fondi.Il prezzo del biglietto non è sufficiente per coprire i costi di gestione e di manutenzione del Museo che è quindi attualmente chiuso. Per me questo è inaccettabile: voglio credere di vivere in una Nazione che ama il proprio patrimonio artistico e culturale, e uno stato è formato prima di tutto dai suoi Cittadini e dunque è a loro che mi rivolgo, a tutti quegli appassionati d'arte e di storia che non si arrendono al triste destino di un'Italia che non crede abbastanza nella sua inesauribile Bellezza.Chiunque può dare un piccolo contributo, anche di un euro: verrà ricompensato con una visita gratuita al Museo. Chi non può contribuire economicamente può - se vuole - aiutarmi a sostenere la causa spargendo la voce.Voglio credere ancora nei sogni. E anche se a volte la tentazione di mollare è forte, penso sempre a un famoso proverbio: ""Non arrenderti: rischieresti di farlo un'ora prima del miracolo"".Dicono di noi:""Un tesoro da salvare"" - Vittorio Sgarbi - Critico e storico dell'arte ""Un patrimonio eccezionale, non solo per Orvieto, ma per tutta la storia della Ceramica italiana del Medioevo e del Rinascimento"" - Timoty Wilson - Professore d'arte presso l'Università di Oxford""Questo Museo straordinario, per il suo carattere unico, dovrebbe essere considerato essenziale non solo per la città di Orvieto, ma per tutta l'umanità, e dovrebbe essere salvaguardato, e quindi sottoposto a tutela, conservazione e valorizzazione, come previsto dal Codice dei Beni Culturali"" -  Luciano Frazzoni - Direttore del Museo F. Rittatore Vonwiller, Farnese (VT)""Un patrimonio da salvare"" Antonella Frezzolini - Studiosa di ceramica anticaLa nostra pagina Facebook: www.facebook.com/ceramicunderground.orgIl nostro sito internet: www.ceramicunderground.orgCi trovate anche su Twitter: @ceramicundergrI love my father, he has spent all his life for the Museum of Ceramics. The Museum suffered a lack of government funding: over the years, the Museum has used its resources to make up the statal shortfall, and this has placed a tremendous strain on our budget.The closure of the Museum means that it is wrong believing in art, history, culture,dreams? No, I still want to believe in dreams!Closing the Museum would be depriving people access to education facilites so vital to our understanding of ceramic history of the whole world. I ask you to help me keep alive the dream of my father. His amazing Museum can not close!The museum carved out of tufa rockThe Museum premises are
particularly inspiring and a remarkable attraction in themselves. Almost
entirely carved out of tufa rock, the Museum unveils archaeological structures
dating back to the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, such as a fifteenth-century
kiln for firing majolicas, which is the only one existing in Italy and,
possibly, in the whole world, and is almost intact.  Furthermore, the kiln dumps can be seen too, as
well as the structure of a typical winekeeping cellar.
The majolicas are displayed
in glass cases fitted to old niches carved out of tufa rock; in some cases the
safety glasses have been directly fitted to the walls and wooden structures have
been provided for support.  
Both private clients and
public institutions have been borrowing the collection exhibits on occasions,
whether to make commercial copies or have the town represented in local,
national and international exhibitions respectively; furthermore, schools of
all grades, including Italian and foreign universities, have benefited from the
permanent exhibition for cultural visits and documentation, together with more
or less occasional visitors. It should not be overlooked
that, in spite of Orvieto being one of the most famous towns in Italy in the
tradition of ceramics, a local Museum specialized in this field had yet to be
created therefore it was necessary for someone to fulfil such a need.Your funding will go 100% towards helping to sustain the Museum.About us""A treasure to be saved"" - Vittorio Sgarbi - The most important art critic in Italy
""This is an exceptional heritage, not only for Orvieto, but throughout the history of Italian ceramics of the Middle Ages and Renaissance"" Timothy Wilson - Professor of the Arts of the Renaissance at Oxford University



""A heritage to be saved"" Antonella Frazzolini - Ancient ceramics researcher
""This extraordinary museum, for its unique character, should be considered essential not only for the city of Orvieto, but for all mankind, and should be safeguarded and therefore submitted to protection, conservation and enhancement, as required by the Code of Cultural Heritage"" Luciano Frazzoni

Accessing facilities means living life to the full, sharing spaces and opportunities for meeting other people.
This is everyone’s right, enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which rules that States Parties should take appropriate measures to ensure that persons with disabilities have access to the physical environment and to transportation, among other things. 


Visiting a unique special city like Venice on board a GONDOLA, one of the symbols of Venice, is not possible for wheelchair users. This is NOT RIGHT.   
GONDOLAS4ALL ONLUS aims to  solve this problem:





gondolas must be accessible to everyone, including wheelchair users:


wheelchair users must be able to get into a gondola safely and independently


Venice must become an even more accessible city


The Gondolas4All project goes back to the beginning of 2012 and was developed from an idea of Alessandro Dalla Pieta’, aged 38 and a gondolier with twenty years of experience, and Enrico Greifenberg, his friend and colleague. The project has already obtained 50 thousand euros from the Veneto Regional Authorities, who are committed to supporting the development of accessible tourism in the lagoon city.

GONDOLAS4ALL has designed a completely new solution, never previously implemented: the construction of a special jetty combined with an automatic wheelchair lift, able to transfer wheelchair users onto the gondola in a safe controlled way. 





The special jetty: this is a floating jetty made entirely of recycled plastic obtained from tetrapak processing and produced by the company Rein. 
Access to the jetty is provided by a non-slip ramp.  
The automatic wheelchair lift: the jetty is provided with a special lift; the wheelchair is fixed to the lift which, by means of two motors, moves it and positions it directly in the gondola, a simple safe operation. The automatic wheelchair lift will be produced by Fadiel, a leading company in Europe specialising in equipment for the disabled.






The person can remain comfortably seated in his/her manual wheelchair


It adapts to different types of motor disability 


Boarding is performed in complete safety 




The Gondolas4All gondoliers are expert purposely trained operators: they have all followed a course provided by UILDM VENEZIA (Italian Association of Muscular Dystrophy) and have obtained certification in the following:



disability terminology;


knowledge of different disabilities and related mobility needs;

knowledge of relational/emotional aspects. 







The financing will be used to produce the first accessible jetty complete with automatic wheelchair lift which will be built by the company Rein. 
The jetty has been designed by the Venice firm of architects and engineers “Studio di Architetti e Ingegneri Moro Venezia” (and already submitted at the end of 2013 to the Venice town planning department). 
The automatic wheelchair lift will be produced by Fadiel, a leading company in Europe specialising in equipment for the disabled, which has already designed for Volvo a seat which can lift a person into a lorry cab.  



The first special jetty complete with automatic wheelchair lift will be installed in Venice in Piazzale Roma, the point of arrival for cars and buses with the railway station nearby.

carrozzina viene fissata alla pedana
che, grazie a due motori, la sposta e
la colloca direttamente nella
gondola con una manovra semplice
e sicura. La pedana automatica sarà
prodotta dalla società Fadiel,
azienda leader in Europa e
specializzata in ausili per disabili. 



















la persona può rimanere comodamente seduta nella propria carrozzina manuale a spinta;


si adatta a diversi tipi di disabilità motoria;


la manovra di imbarco avviene in modo sicuro.





I gondolieri di Gondolas4All sono esperti e specializzati: con un corso di formazione della UILDM (Unione Italiana Lotta alla Distrofia Muscolare) hanno ottenuto un attestato e delle competenze su:



terminologia relativa alla disabilità; 


competenze rispetto alle diverse disabilità e relative esigenze di mobilità;

competenze in ambito relazionale/emotivo.
















Il finanziamento serve a realizzare il primo pontile accessibile
completo di pedana automatica che sarà costruito dalla ditta Rein.
Il pontile è stato progettato dallo Studio di Architetti e Ingegneri Moro
di Venezia (e già presentato alla fine del 2013 agli uffici di Edilizia
Privata del Comune di Venezia).
La pedana automatica sarà prodotta dalla società Fadiel, azienda
leader in Europa e specializzata in ausili per disabili, che ha già
progettato per Volvo un sedile in grado di far salire una persona fino
alla cabina del camion. 















Il primo pontile speciale completo di pedana automatica sarà
costruito a Venezia in Piazzale Roma, punto di arrivo con le auto, gli
autobus e i treni.

</p><p>Hello! I am Maeve Broome, an artist and designer from Maine.
I have a small clothing company called MYFAWNWY, which specializes in
experimental hand dyed textiles that I sew by hand into special garments. I am
completely self-taught when it comes to my textile and clothing design and have
been slowly growing MYFAWNWY over the last few years. I have recently been
accepted into a competitive nine month art residency at the Textile Arts Center
in Brooklyn, NY which begins September 14<sup>th</sup> of this year.</p>
<p>This residency will give me the tools and time to take my
clothing company to the next level. I will gain business training, have a studio
space and access to incredible facilities and classes, be paired with a mentor
and have weekly studio visits and critiques with people in the fashion
community which will strengthen my skills and help my business grow and thrive.
I will be designing a new clothing collection with access to technical support,
as well as having time to further explore the boundaries between fashion and
art through collaboration, performance, and experimentation, pushing my work forward into a new space.
The residency will finish next summer with an art show in Brooklyn where I will
show my new collection and body of work.</p>
<p>My goal with this residency is to gain knowledge, training and
a strong creative network to bring back to Maine and help grow my business. I
plan on working with Maine manufacturers to produce MYFAWNWY products locally,
hiring graduates from local schools, starting an internship program and working
in communities to engage with our youth and our skilled crafters. We
have a long history of traditional craft in Maine and I would like to create some truly special projects by collaborating with our artisans and shining a contemporary spotlight on their talents. The potential of my business plans all contribute to enlivening the
local economy and helping to put Maine on the fashion and art map of the world.
The artist residency at the Textile Arts Center is an incredible spring board
for these goals to materialize and become a reality.</p>
<p>I am seeking support to pay for the tuition of the residency.
I received a partial scholarship but still owe $7500 for the nine month
program. I will be working a few part time jobs during the residency to pay for housing and living expenses as well as all of my art materials. I am seeking financial support to cover the tuition costs which will allow me to focus on this opportunity and make the absolute most of it.</p>
<p>Everyone who donates will receive a special handmade gift
and a limited edition art print in the mail to express my sincere gratitude, so please provide
me with your mailing address! Thank you so much for taking the time to read
about my project and I wish you all the very best in your own dreams and
endeavors.</p>

<b>Hello friends!<br/><br/></b>
<p><b>We want to make a
dream come true</b>, offering a new concept of space design which we believe will both enhance
people’s leisure experience” and promote artistic values. We want to bring
forth a space in which people can live with Art, surrounded by it day and night;
enjoying an immersion in such beauty that it will bring an explosion to their senses.</p>
<p>We started this
project in order to combine art and tourism by offering travellers the
opportunity to stay at “La Casita del Arte” (The little house of Art). There,
<b>the fusion of its surrounding captivating landscapes...</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447584489/uv8hdhnoqimxcki5lusn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
and the art works which
will decorate rooms and common spaces will certainly create a perfect
environment for a personal dialog between nature, art and emotion. <br/>
<p><b>It is
more than a project, <span>it is the sum of the dreams
of all who compose it and those who help us implement it.</span></b></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447584585/vujznixhylkvplxt1dqg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Rooms will be
namedafter an artist and decorated
with some of her or his works which will give them a special personality. In
shared spaces we will combine a selection of the artists who will be joining us
in the journey. One room will be devoted to a young talented artist, promising
youngsters from schools of art or self-taught, giving them the opportunity to
show their skills and ideas, not only in their works but also in the decoration
of the room. We think this will help them to grow in the magical world of
creation, and also by contributing to their studies.

<p>We want our
little house to be an Arts Centre, a driving force for future workshops in
painting, sculpture, photography and music. <br/></p>

for the promotion of regional wine and cuisine, events where our guests will
be able to participate in  both tasting and learning about the arts and crafts
which they involve.<br/><p>
Travelers and friends of “La Casita del Arte”, will also have the
opportunity to purchase the artworks exposed in the house. Our aim is to
bring people closer to art, providing access to a wide range of art works, that they can
enjoy in their everyday environment if they desire to.</p>
<p>To make this
possible we needed a suitable environment which had to be in harmony with the
art pieces it will be hosting. This is the
reason we’ve chosen our old family house, a mansion, almost a century on its
“shoulders”, nearly in ruins but full of good spirit and vibrations.  <br/></p>

are relatively small but cute and cozy. You can enjoy a great view from all
the bedrooms, some to the mountains and some to the gardens.<b> Over 1500 square meters
of elaborated and peaceful gardens of native plants and trees will offer a great environment for
guests to relax, walk, sun bathe, read or have a nice chat</b>. 

<p>The project has
needed intensive labour and expensive materials from the very
start, the changes required to recover the house and transform it in such an
environment have been higher than expected. So far we have invested over a 114,000
USD in the renovation process but in order to finish it we estimate the total
costs will reach about 171,000 USD (145,000.00 to finish the works in the house
and 26,000.00 to purchase of equipment). And that’s why we need your support for
this project.</p>
<p>To make this
happen,and offer a new way of relaxing, and enjoying beauty and culture to those
who like visiting the country-side and the same time help artists and
crafters promote their work, we estimate<b> we need to raise another 49,000 USD</b>,
which when added to our remaining founds, <b>will bring our project to life</b>.</p>
<p><b>For those willing
to make a contribution, we have also prepared a very special and exclusive plan
of rewards</b> based on the support of the artists who participate and back the
project. Donors and participants will have the opportunity to receive reproductions
of their artwork, customized if required by the artists themselves so they
become unique pieces, signed and with a certificate of authenticity. We will make
limited editions per work, all of them printed on certified high quality 100%
cotton and acid-free paper.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The works
that make up the rewards, have <span>been selflessly
donated by artists excited about this new road opened in a world of
innovation of artistic production, but locked into old formats as to the
diffusion of works and culture.</span><span></span></p>

<p><b>Comments about the work:</b>
</p>
<p>How can we turn a painting into a three-dimensional object?
How can we give back its volume to a sculpture through painting? These are some
of the questions that Camen González Castro tries to answer by using
anamorphosis, a procedure to distort an image that moves the viewer to
contemplate a painting from several points of view, not only in front of it,
but also from the edge of it. There, the distortion disappears and becomes
understandable. This is what happens in ‘Theseus and the Centaur’, a work
inspired by Greek and Roman mythology that shows the confrontation between
opposites, between heroes and monsters, where figures emerge from dark empty
holes.</p>

<p><b>Comments about the work:</b> trying to represent the idea of the dream world, which is far from the
established order of things.<br/></p>
<p>
In almost all his works Pareja makes everything ready in from the center, as the central
axis of an idea of transcendent order. It’s the center of gravity and the beginning
of all things.</p>
<p>In general, a kind of childish feeling transpires but completely all sweet.<br/></p>
<p>""... Why do I feel that your work is a glorious dawn after a bad night of
the soul ? Love alive, the distressed beauty, the infinite and the
insignificance are placed at the same level in your work and you sit us, we who
look, in an uncomfortable seat supported by a disconcerting tenderness.

be a great a great contribution!</b></p>In the case we don’t obtain enough funds to complete the work, we will dedicate
the funds to the promotion of art by supporting young artists,and creating
fairs and exhibitions in those places where it is not easy to enjoy cultural

zonas comunes con una muestra de cada uno de los que nos acompañan en este
viaje.<br/><br/><p>Una de las
habitaciones se dedicará a jóvenes promesas, que saldrán de entre los
estudiantes del Bachillerato de Artes, a los que ayudaremos a crecer en el

trabajos de los artistas que allí representemos. Queremos trabajar para
acercarles el arte a su vida, facilitándoles el acceso a las obras para que puedan

</p>
<p>¿Cómo hacer de un cuadro un objeto tridimensional? ¿Cómo
devolver a la escultura su volumen desde la pintura? Estas son las cuestiones a
las que Carmen González Castro intenta dar respuesta utilizando la anamorfosis,
un procedimiento de deformación de las imágenes que obliga a contemplar el
cuadro desde varios puntos de vista, frontalmente, pero también desde el margen
del cuadro, donde la deformación desaparece y se hace legible. Así sucede en Teseo
y el Centauro, una obra inspirada en la mitología y la antigüedad clásica que
ilustra el enfrentamiento entre opuestos, entre héroes y monstruos, donde las
figuras parecen emerger de profundos agujeros oscuros de vacío en la pared
blanca.</p>

Hello friends!
We want to make a
dream come true, offering a new concept of space design which we believe will both enhance
people’s leisure experience” and promote artistic values. We want to bring
forth a space in which people can live with Art, surrounded by it day and night;
enjoying an immersion in such beauty that it will bring an explosion to their senses.
We started this
project in order to combine art and tourism by offering travellers the
opportunity to stay at “La Casita del Arte” (The little house of Art). There,
the fusion of its surrounding captivating landscapes...


and the art works which
will decorate rooms and common spaces will certainly create a perfect
environment for a personal dialog between nature, art and emotion. 
It is
more than a project, it is the sum of the dreams
of all who compose it and those who help us implement it.

Rooms will be
namedafter an artist and decorated
with some of her or his works which will give them a special personality. In
shared spaces we will combine a selection of the artists who will be joining us
in the journey. One room will be devoted to a young talented artist, promising
youngsters from schools of art or self-taught, giving them the opportunity to
show their skills and ideas, not only in their works but also in the decoration
of the room. We think this will help them to grow in the magical world of
creation, and also by contributing to their studies.

We want our
little house to be an Arts Centre, a driving force for future workshops in
painting, sculpture, photography and music. 


In addition we will organize events
for the promotion of regional wine and cuisine, events where our guests will
be able to participate in  both tasting and learning about the arts and crafts
which they involve.
Travelers and friends of “La Casita del Arte”, will also have the
opportunity to purchase the artworks exposed in the house. Our aim is to
bring people closer to art, providing access to a wide range of art works, that they can
enjoy in their everyday environment if they desire to.
To make this
possible we needed a suitable environment which had to be in harmony with the
art pieces it will be hosting. This is the
reason we’ve chosen our old family house, a mansion, almost a century on its
“shoulders”, nearly in ruins but full of good spirit and vibrations.  
Nearly in ruins...


...


And we are renovating it!


...


...

So that you can enjoy it!We started its
renovation straight afterwards and so far we have managed to build 7 rooms, all
of them with private bathroom:



a spacious common-room and a kitchen:

The rooms
are relatively small but cute and cozy. You can enjoy a great view from all
the bedrooms, some to the mountains and some to the gardens. Over 1500 square meters
of elaborated and peaceful gardens of native plants and trees will offer a great environment for
guests to relax, walk, sun bathe, read or have a nice chat. 

The project has
needed intensive labour and expensive materials from the very
start, the changes required to recover the house and transform it in such an
environment have been higher than expected. So far we have invested over a 114,000
USD in the renovation process but in order to finish it we estimate the total
costs will reach about 171,000 USD (145,000.00 to finish the works in the house
and 26,000.00 to purchase of equipment). And that’s why we need your support for
this project.
To make this
happen,and offer a new way of relaxing, and enjoying beauty and culture to those
who like visiting the country-side and the same time help artists and
crafters promote their work, we estimate we need to raise another 49,000 USD,
which when added to our remaining founds, will bring our project to life.
For those willing
to make a contribution, we have also prepared a very special and exclusive plan
of rewards based on the support of the artists who participate and back the
project. Donors and participants will have the opportunity to receive reproductions
of their artwork, customized if required by the artists themselves so they
become unique pieces, signed and with a certificate of authenticity. We will make
limited editions per work, all of them printed on certified high quality 100%
cotton and acid-free paper.


The works
that make up the rewards, have been selflessly
donated by artists excited about this new road opened in a world of
innovation of artistic production, but locked into old formats as to the
diffusion of works and culture.
- PERKS:- Newsletter:We will subcribe you to our newspaper so that you are able to keep up to date with our activities. This way you may also have the opportunity to enjoy special offers made by the artists who work with us.- Post card with special design:

The market value is much higher.You can find it in alphabetical order by author:

Work sheet: ""Teseo y el Centauro"". 2015. Oil on canvas. Measurements original work: 70 x 70
cm.
Work belonging to the series ""Héroes y Monstruos""
Comments about the work:

How can we turn a painting into a three-dimensional object?
How can we give back its volume to a sculpture through painting? These are some
of the questions that Camen González Castro tries to answer by using
anamorphosis, a procedure to distort an image that moves the viewer to
contemplate a painting from several points of view, not only in front of it,
but also from the edge of it. There, the distortion disappears and becomes
understandable. This is what happens in ‘Theseus and the Centaur’, a work
inspired by Greek and Roman mythology that shows the confrontation between
opposites, between heroes and monsters, where figures emerge from dark empty
holes.

Work sheet: ""Vigilia"". 2015. Oil on canvas. Measurements original works: 33 x 41 cm.
Comments about the work: trying to represent the idea of the dream world, which is far from the
established order of things.

In almost all his works Pareja makes everything ready in from the center, as the central
axis of an idea of transcendent order. It’s the center of gravity and the beginning
of all things.
In general, a kind of childish feeling transpires but completely all sweet.
""... Why do I feel that your work is a glorious dawn after a bad night of
the soul ? Love alive, the distressed beauty, the infinite and the
insignificance are placed at the same level in your work and you sit us, we who
look, in an uncomfortable seat supported by a disconcerting tenderness.
""Virginia Torres.

Work sheet: ""Encina y nube"". Oil on linen. 1994. Measurements original work: 61 x 54 cm.


Author commentary: thin and semitransparent color layers, smooth shades which
make the changes of color virtually undetectable to the naked eye, glazes that
make the painting represents, rather than the object being depicted, the very
atmosphere which separates it from the viewer. They are representations of
distant memories, dreams and desires rather than portrayals of landscapes. 
- Yolanda Martínez:https://www.facebook.com/yolandamartinezc/photos_albums



Work sheet: ""Blanco"". Nails and feathers on cardboard: 12,5 x 12,5 cm. Work belonging to the serie “Iris”.
Author commentary: aggression and sweetness, the delicacy and resounding as the search for unity and balance of opposites. From that antagonism it is invited to ""come out"" of perceptual stagnation offering a single vision.


If you can’t
participate in the project financially but you like the idea, do not worry! Help us by sending
this information to your friends to show them what we are doing. This would also
be a great a great contribution!In the case we don’t obtain enough funds to complete the work, we will dedicate
the funds to the promotion of art by supporting young artists,and creating
fairs and exhibitions in those places where it is not easy to enjoy cultural
events due to the long distances to urban centers. We will try to bring
artistic activities to them not only for the enjoyment of the senses, but also
to show new ways and opportunities of life.
Thanks for paying attention to our proposal, we hope you liked our
project and we hope we can count on you to help us make it happen so that we can
enjoy La Casita del Arte together when the time comes!

¡Arte, Turismo y Ocio!



¡Hola amigos!

Queremos realizar
un sueño ofreciendo un nuevo diseño de espacio para, de una forma innovadora,
promocionar y disfrutar el arte, que se pueda convivir con él durante el día y
la noche
Hemos puesto
en marcha un proyecto para unir el arte al turismo, ofreciendo a los viajeros
que se alojen en La Casita del Arte, un entorno en el que puedan disfrutar de
la fusión de un paisaje cautivador...

con obras de arte que decorando sus
habitaciones y las zonas comunes, inicien un diálogo a tres bandas entre la
naturaleza, el arte y la emoción.

Es más que un proyecto, es la suma de los sueños de todos
los que lo componemos y de aquellos que nos ayudan a ponerlo en marcha. 

Las
habitaciones se bautizarán con el nombre de un artista y se decorará con sus
obras, dando así a cada una de ellas una personalidad especial, ocupando las
zonas comunes con una muestra de cada uno de los que nos acompañan en este
viaje.Una de las
habitaciones se dedicará a jóvenes promesas, que saldrán de entre los
estudiantes del Bachillerato de Artes, a los que ayudaremos a crecer en el
mágico mundo de la creación, colaborando en su formación.
Queremos que
nuestro centro turístico de arte, sea un motor para la elaboración de talleres
de pintura, escultura, fotografía o música...


...además de un foco cultural en el
mundo del vino y la gastronomía, promoviendo catas y cursos donde los amigos
que nos visiten podrán participar y aprender. 

Los viajeros
y amigos de La Casita del Arte tendrán también la oportunidad de adquirir los
trabajos de los artistas que allí representemos. Queremos trabajar para
acercarles el arte a su vida, facilitándoles el acceso a las obras para que puedan
disfrutarlas en su entorno cotidiano.
Para ponerlo
en práctica, queríamos un entorno adecuado, que estuviese en armonía con la
belleza de las obras que expondremos y para ello escogimos nuestra antigua casa
familiar, de hace cinco generaciones, casi con 100 años a cuestas y con
fantasmas buenos. 
Estaba en ruinas...


...
 y la estamos recuperando!...




...


Para que podáis disfrutarla :-) !Hemos conseguido
siete habitaciones, todas con baño...
más una zona común y la cocina. 

Son
habitaciones pequeñas, coquetas y confortables, con vistas excelentes, unas a
la montaña y las otras al jardín de pinos. Tiene más de mil quinientos metros
cuadrados de jardines elaborados con la flora autóctona, en los que relajarse,
pasear, tomar el sol, leer o conversar apaciblemente...


Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes.
Queremos
contar con vuestro apoyo para poder ofrecer este nuevo espacio de relax, en que
la belleza y la cultura se integren en nuestra vida durante nuestras escapadas en
busca de nuevas emociones...
Para ello
necesitamos recaudar 49.000USD, de los 171.000 que son necesarios para toda la
reforma. 
El proyecto tiene
un coste de obra, con todas las modificaciones que requiere la recuperación de la antigua
casa, de 145.800USD y la compra del equipamiento de 26.000,00 más. En total 171.000,00
USD., de los que ya hemos desembolsado más de la mitad.
Para los que
os sea posible participar, hemos preparado un plan de recompensas muy especial
y exclusivo, apoyado por los artistas que colaboran el proyecto, de forma que
podréis recibir reproducciones de sus obras de arte,  firmadas y modificadas
una a una por los propios artistas, convirtiéndolas en piezas únicas, de gran
valor, con certificado de autenticidad, series numeradas y limitadas en
unidades; impresas con calidad museo en papel libre de ácidos y base de algodón y
con sello de calidad gofrado. 

Las obras que conforman las recompensas, las han donado
desinteresadamente artistas ilusionados por este nuevo camino abierto en un
mundo innovador en las producciones artísticas, pero encasillado en antiguos
formatos en cuanto a la difusión de las obras y la cultura.- RECOMPENSAS!!!- Newsletter:Te incluiremos en nuestro listado de suscriptores de newsletter para que te mantengas al día de nuestras actividades y para que puedas tener la oportunidad de aprovechar las ofertas especiales que hacemos de la mano de los artistas que colaboran con nosotros.- Tarjeta postal con nuestro diseño especial y agradecimiento:Te enviaremos una tarjeta diseñada especialmente para La Casita del Arte y con nuestro agradecimeinto personal manuscrito.- Camiseta unisex con nuestro diseño personal:Camiseta de algodón unisex con el diseño especial de La Casita del Arte impreso.- Cuaderno artesano de dibujo:

Reseña del autor: Trata de representar la idea del mundo de los sueños, que lejos está del orden

En casi todas

todas las cosas.
De forma
general, se trasluce una especie de sentimiento infantil pero no acaba de ser

<p><b>For many Asian Americans the lack of visibility in the public sphere is a persistent and pervasive problem.</b> So in commemoration of our organization's 25th anniversary, we decided to react by creating a collective mural that will claim and transform visual public space to reflect who we are and root our vibrant community. We want to honor all Asian American women in the arts of past and present while providing inspiration to future generations.</p>

</div></div>","The Project



For many Asian Americans the lack of visibility in the public sphere is a persistent and pervasive problem. So in commemoration of our organization's 25th anniversary, we decided to react by creating a collective mural that will claim and transform visual public space to reflect who we are and root our vibrant community. We want to honor all Asian American women in the arts of past and present while providing inspiration to future generations.

To realize our project we’ve teamed up with local and well-respected Asian American women muralists Cece Carpio (Trust Your Struggle, SF Public Arts Commission) and Erin Yoshi (Trust Your Struggle, The Estria Foundation). With their expertise, AAWAA artists and community members will envision, craft, and paint a mural befitting of our organization’s legacy.Artwork: courtesy of Erin Yoshi.Artwork: courtesy of Cece Carpio.
The mural will be located in the Richmond District of San Francisco, a diverse area sandwiched by Golden Gate park and the Presidio with a sizable Asian American population, including many artists, writers, musicians, and other creative makers. 


The Impact 

Cultural Visibility for Asian Americans
San Francisco has long been the epicenter of Asian American life and culture. The oldest running Asian American arts nonprofit was founded here, we have the nation’s largest yearly Asian film festival , we are the birthplace of Asian American studies, and Asians make up about one third of the city’s population. And yet, there’s no Asian American public art space in San Francisco.

Commissioning this mural  is our way of commemorating AAWAA's jubilee year while claiming a physical and visual public space. We ultimately want to raise the visibility of a community that has made so many historical contributions to this city.

Public Art Improving Economic & Social Environment

Public art adds cultural value to the area, encouraging community building & visitors to the neighborhood.

Be part of the AAWAA Legacy of successfully staging art exhibitions, screenings, lectures, panel discussions, and workshops for the past 25 years.

OF MUTABOTS</p>
<p>In late 2013,
almost playing, and because of my work related to construction, I found among
the materials around me (WOOD / IRON / ETC) forms that I start to work with,
creating sculptures that I called ""Mutabots"". From the beginning, I
liked the idea of working with recycled and reused materials for several reasons,
including the issue of recycling and giving them a second chance, as well as
the endless possibilities they offer me, as they are generally all different.</p>
<p>Over time,
Mutabots began to evolve, and looking to provide a more detailed finishing, I
started using obsolete electronic parts in the construction process, which is
also closely associated to the problem of waste and electronic scrap, something
that was fully compatible with the original idea. The result of this was the
building of many more robots. By creating the Mutabots community, I started to
show my work with good reviews, first among my acquaintances, and then in the
social networks (FACEBOOK / TWITTER / INSTAGRAM). The reception and critics
were always very good; the press received them very well, interviewing me in
several occasions; and even a publisher from the USA approved the printing of a
Mutabots book, in which I am currently working.</p>
<p>I always knew
there was something more behind the Mutabots, rather than only a simple sculpture.
Mutabots is in fact an art project with many facets that could be open. From
the making of a book, the shooting of a film, to the creation of merchandising
that could teach people how to build their own Mutabots, thus raising awareness
about recycling and reuse of materials.</p>
<p>Each Mutabot
is unique not only for its composition, but also because they have a name and
personality features, which makes each of them one of a kind.</p>
<p>While I had
inquiries from interested people trying to buy them in the near past, so far I
have not sold them, as I decided to verify in which direction I want to head towards
with the project. Today, almost two years later, my intention is to make the
Mutabots something much more important than a sculpture. My idea is to make
them associated to characters who express commitment. This commitment relates
to environmental protection, recycling and appreciation of this alternative art
form.</p>
<p>Although I
decided not to sell, I have been giving lately to different personalities one
Mutabot, as a personal recognition to people who excels at what they do, and in
turn, they appreciate this art form with great impact and gratitude.</p><br/><div>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441832622/gjddb3zhz4hhonsgtywi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><b><u>NEXT STEPS </u></b></p>
<p>• Create a
website where, besides showing the characters with their new owners and record
where each person has a Mutabot; visitors will be able to know the info and
history of each character. </p>
<p>• Spread the
project's essence and its social content regarding recycling and ptotecting the
environment.</p>
<p>• Present and
display Mutabots in different fairs and exhibitions. </p>
<p>• Finish
editing the book of Mutabots. </p>
<p>• Launch a
variety of products (eg: t-shirts/mugs) with Mutabots imagery. </p>
<p>• Conduct
workshops where I could teach how to create art through the reuse and recycling
of materials.</p>
<p>In short, the
idea is to make Mutabots be recognized everywhere as the characters or
associated with recycling and reuse. This requires more time and dedication,
and my goal is to do so in the short term. Recently I was invited to
participate in <b><u>OXFORD INTERNATIONAL
ART FAIR 2016</u></b>, something I'm considering at the moment, in order to
explore other paths.</p>

<p>Collaborating
with the Mutabots project is not only an economic issue. You can
""Like"" or follow the Mutabots in social networks, as well as
recommend a friend or acquaintance to pay attention to the project and see its
possibilities. I just found, at the age of 40, an art form that also aims to
raise social awareness about caring for the planet. I want to share this way of
making art with the world, and that those who are lucky enough to ever have a
Mutabot, know that it is not only a sculpture, because they know the story
behind it.</p>
<p><b><u>ABOUT ME </u></b></p>
<p>My name is
Juan Pablo González Acosta, I'm 41, I have a wife and two children, and live in
Argentina. I love art since my childhood, and I've been always painting since
then, making sculptures or recycling furniture. This is something I've done for
a long time, where my passion is and I really feel full.</p>

<p><b><u>HISTORIA
DE LOS MUTABOTS </u></b></p>
<p>A
fines del año 2013, casi jugando, descubro entre los materiales que me rodean por
mi actividad (MADERA / HIERRO / ETC) formas que empiezo a trabajar creando unas
esculturas a las que denomino “Mutabots”. Desde un principio me gustó la idea
de trabajar con materiales reutilizados por varios motivos, entre ellos el tema
de reciclar y darles una segunda oportunidad, como así también la infinidad de
posibilidades que estos me ofrecen, ya que en general son todos distintos. </p>
<p>Con
el tiempo los Mutabots empezaron a evolucionar, y buscando darles más detalles
de terminación, incorporé en su construcción piezas de electrónica en desuso, algo
que también está muy asociado la problemática de la basura y scrap electrónico,
lo cual era completamente compatible con la idea original, haciendo así muchos
más robots. Creando la comunidad MUTABOTS, empecé a mostrar mi trabajo con
buena crítica, primero entre mis conocidos y luego en las redes sociales (FACEBOOK/TWITTER/INSTAGRAM).
La recepción y crítica siempre fueron muy buenas, la prensa los recibió muy
bien haciéndome varias notas, e inclusive una editorial de USA aprobó la
publicación de un libro de los MUTABOTS en el cual estoy trabajando en este
momento.</p>
<p>Siempre
supe que detrás de los Mutabots había más que una escultura había un proyecto
de arte y personajes con múltiples aristas para explorar, desde hacer un libro,
una película, merchandising hasta enseñar a las personas a crear sus propios Mutabots
y de esta forma generar conciencia sobre el reciclado y la reutilización.</p>
<p>Cada
Mutabot es único no solo por su composición, sino porque además tienen un
nombre y características de personalidad, lo que hace que sean personajes
muchas veces con características y problemáticas de personas reales</p>
<p>Si
bien he tenido e interesados en comprarlos, hasta el momento no lo hice ya que
decidí ver hacia donde quería ir con el proyecto. Hoy, casi dos años después,
es mi intención hacer de los Mutabots algo mucho más importante que una

ambiental y de cuidado del planeta de quien lo tenga. Este compromiso se

OF MUTABOTS
In late 2013,
almost playing, and because of my work related to construction, I found among
the materials around me (WOOD / IRON / ETC) forms that I start to work with,
creating sculptures that I called ""Mutabots"". From the beginning, I
liked the idea of working with recycled and reused materials for several reasons,
including the issue of recycling and giving them a second chance, as well as
the endless possibilities they offer me, as they are generally all different.
Over time,
Mutabots began to evolve, and looking to provide a more detailed finishing, I
started using obsolete electronic parts in the construction process, which is
also closely associated to the problem of waste and electronic scrap, something
that was fully compatible with the original idea. The result of this was the
building of many more robots. By creating the Mutabots community, I started to
show my work with good reviews, first among my acquaintances, and then in the
social networks (FACEBOOK / TWITTER / INSTAGRAM). The reception and critics
were always very good; the press received them very well, interviewing me in
several occasions; and even a publisher from the USA approved the printing of a
Mutabots book, in which I am currently working.
I always knew
there was something more behind the Mutabots, rather than only a simple sculpture.
Mutabots is in fact an art project with many facets that could be open. From
the making of a book, the shooting of a film, to the creation of merchandising
that could teach people how to build their own Mutabots, thus raising awareness
about recycling and reuse of materials.
Each Mutabot
is unique not only for its composition, but also because they have a name and
personality features, which makes each of them one of a kind.
While I had
inquiries from interested people trying to buy them in the near past, so far I
have not sold them, as I decided to verify in which direction I want to head towards
with the project. Today, almost two years later, my intention is to make the
Mutabots something much more important than a sculpture. My idea is to make
them associated to characters who express commitment. This commitment relates
to environmental protection, recycling and appreciation of this alternative art
form.
Although I
decided not to sell, I have been giving lately to different personalities one
Mutabot, as a personal recognition to people who excels at what they do, and in
turn, they appreciate this art form with great impact and gratitude.


NEXT STEPS 
• Create a
website where, besides showing the characters with their new owners and record
where each person has a Mutabot; visitors will be able to know the info and
history of each character. 
• Spread the
project's essence and its social content regarding recycling and ptotecting the
environment.
• Present and
display Mutabots in different fairs and exhibitions. 
• Finish
editing the book of Mutabots. 
• Launch a
variety of products (eg: t-shirts/mugs) with Mutabots imagery. 
• Conduct
workshops where I could teach how to create art through the reuse and recycling
of materials.
In short, the
idea is to make Mutabots be recognized everywhere as the characters or
associated with recycling and reuse. This requires more time and dedication,
and my goal is to do so in the short term. Recently I was invited to
participate in OXFORD INTERNATIONAL
ART FAIR 2016, something I'm considering at the moment, in order to
explore other paths.




WHY BE PART OF THE MUTABOTS PROJECT
Collaborating
with the Mutabots project is not only an economic issue. You can
""Like"" or follow the Mutabots in social networks, as well as
recommend a friend or acquaintance to pay attention to the project and see its
possibilities. I just found, at the age of 40, an art form that also aims to
raise social awareness about caring for the planet. I want to share this way of
making art with the world, and that those who are lucky enough to ever have a
Mutabot, know that it is not only a sculpture, because they know the story
behind it.
ABOUT ME 
My name is
Juan Pablo González Acosta, I'm 41, I have a wife and two children, and live in
Argentina. I love art since my childhood, and I've been always painting since
then, making sculptures or recycling furniture. This is something I've done for
a long time, where my passion is and I really feel full.

Sincerely
JUAN PABLO

Here is a selection of the artists and performers featured in the book: Jessie Evans, Lada Redstar, Dana Popp, Julietta La Doll, Shari Inessa B., Lula Rose, Larissa Domin, Lydia Johanna, Valentina Belli, Scarlett Martini, Valentina DeMonia, Viv Dee, Sophie Julie, Giuditta Sin, Naomi Fearn, Mad Kate, Agata D'Mon, Jaike Jensen, Nina Wagner, Anastasia Atapin, Pippa the Ripper, KT van Stone, Annina Nusko, Ginger Synne, Hana Lee Erdman, Margaret Lamour, Mollie Black, Jewels Good, Eyleen Kibwebwe, Carolina Rupp, Carole Ruault, La Rubinia, Rebecca Halls, Sarah Josephine, Doria Gray,  Tara la Luna, Mopsy Meyers, Tronicat la Miez, Jessica Drew, Sydney la Faire, Honey Lulu, Mignon, Shan Wang, Galina Andreeva, Gabrielle Miller, Mireia Salip, Tara Meyer, Vega Vargas, Marlene von Steenvag, Maja Fritzon, Evilyn Frantic, La Viola Vixen, Carolina Bavio, Kyrie Maezumi, Johanna Platow Sadonis, Xarah von den Vielenregen, Dyan Valdes, Billie Rae, Hurricane Irina, Cara Celine, Pepper Potemkin.






I have chosen to work closely with a highly renowned printer based in the South of Germany. Excitingly, a new printing technique called UV LED technology will be employed for the book which renders the images more bright on the page and is also more environmentally friendly due to the dyes used. The book pages will be glued as well as stitch-bound for easier turning of pages and better viewing of the photographs.

Perks!

The campaign is run to raise funds for the book printing costs, the purchase of the ISBN number, Indiegogo and Paypal fees, printing of flyers and photographs, package and shipping fees.
Risks & Challenges.

 In years to come this book will hopefully present an interesting and beautiful snapshot of our time, and the artistic underground of this modern city. It would be great if you decide to be a part of this and help bring the project to life!



I will be posting updates about the progress of the book as well as more photographs to be included, printing news, posting schedule etc.
I will do my outmost to have the book and perks ready and delivered in time for Christmas!   Other ways to help. If you like the project, please help to spread the word about this exciting new book!  Thank you!",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

my life changed 36 years ago when I started working for Wisconsin Disability
Coalition, a cross disability advocacy organization. Starting out I knew
nothing about disability, but I met so many interesting talented people with
all sorts of disabilities. I also met an amazing man, who happened to have a
C-4 Spinal Cord injury; it was love at first sight. We married in 1983. We
became foster parents, using our experience with disabilities to specialize in
kids with disabilities which led us to realize that these kids were not getting
the services they needed. As our kids aged they had trouble transitioning into
adulthood. I had this idea . . . what if we could have a place where they could
work on their creative talents and sell the creations in a Gallery? The idea
for Indigo Wings began to form more fully year after year.</p>
<p>Six of those foster
kids became our family, but all the love and support was not enough, they still
struggled. Now that they are all in their 20’s, struggling to find jobs and
support themselves, we realized it was time to make Indigo Wings a reality. In
the process of researching the area we found other adults with similar stories
who wanted to join us. That is when the dream really took wings. We could help
more people if we could offer classes and studio space. </p>
<p>The
perfect rental space at the perfect price became available. We became a 501(c)(3),
all the paper work was done and filed. The purpose of Indigo Wings is to help
people with disabilities become more financially and vocationally independent through
the expression of their creativity. We use the broad definition of disability
established in the American’s with Disabilities Act which turns 25 this year. So
many people with disabilities exist at the poverty level; more than 80% are
unemployed. We can now help some of them earn a supplemental income and the
hope of a career. </p>
<p><b>We need help to get the Studio and Gallery up and running.</b></p>
<p>I mentioned the
perfect rental space at the perfect price, well that’s because all of the
demolition and remodeling is our responsibility. We need to buy paint, drywall
screws, a new sink, bathroom mirror, faucet and door hardware, a
computer/inventory/register device, picture rails to display art, other display
pieces to showcase our jewelry, cards, soaps and many other items. We also need
to patch drywall, replace some flooring, replace light fixtures, purchase
painting easels, paint, brushes and much more.  We need $5,000.00 dollars to purchase all of
the items we need to open our doors. The volunteers have already begun the demolition
and cleaning and we have more standing by as soon as we can get the supplies.  </p>
<p>What’s in it for you?
I thought about why I contribute to campaigns and my main reason is because I
think that my contribution, combined with others can make a difference. One of
our artists is in her 50’s, has had MS for two decades, and now has retinitis
pigmentosa, she is divorced and lives on her SSDI, she also works part time helping
others with disabilities, to make ends meet. Money she earns selling her beautiful
art work will help her stay in the home she has lived in for more than 20 years
and knows very well. We want to make her life better, multiply that by 10 or 20
or 100. This will not cure cancer, but it will help make people’s lives
better.</p>
<p>We are committed to a
12 month lease so we do not have the option to fail. Any and all funds will be
used for this campaign.  Everything earned above the $5,000 will be put towards keeping our doors open and funding for educational programs.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Indigo Wings can help
this community by providing mentoring and training to people with disabilities in
need of support to make money from their artistic endeavors. We have sold
jewelry and photography at conferences in the past, but it really limited the
number of people we could help and there was no space other than my dining room
to create. With a Gallery and Studio there will be plenty of space to create
and we can be open 7 days a week. When you create something and another person
values it enough to purchase it, there is a sense of pride and accomplishment.
We want to help people feel that pride and know that they have value. Our Sellers
Permit is valid as of July 1, 2015. The faster we can get this Gallery finished
the sooner we open to the public.</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Does this scare me?
Very much! I started to put things together, file incorporation papers, 1023EZ
(it actually was), do the Webinars offered by the SBA, listen to all the
statistics, write a Business Plan, find Board Members, talk to everyone, and
get opinions and advice. We are ready to do this; we have committed artists who
have a lot to offer.</p>
<p> I just failed to account for the expense of
making the space ready, it was so big and priced well below market. This is
where you come in; your contribution will directly help us help others. With
the materials, we will fix the holes, paint, make it pretty and open a Gallery
to showcase exceptional art from creative talented people, check a few of them

<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>

need your help to make this happen; you can help get the word out to people in
your network. Don’t forget to use the Indiegogo sharing tools!</p><br/></div>","My name is Kathy and

owner of the Hive, and Michelle Armstrong, local artist and art teacher at
Cardinal Valley Elementary in Lexington, KY are working to raise funds to paint a mural of a beehive and
native KY flowers on the side of the Hive Salon at 156 Deweese Street in
downtown Lexington along with the help of some students from the area. The
goals of this project are to 1) revitalize Deweese Street and downtown Lex with
public art 2) engage community and students in creating art 3) raise awareness
of the declination of the honey bee population.</p>
<p> The Hive is an important gathering place for
the downtown community and we would like to bring public art to this area of
Lexington and also raise awareness about the declination of the honeybee
population. We have invited several student groups to assist us in painting
this mural such as art club students from the 
Sisophromateum Art Foundation, students in the High Street YMCA summer
camp, the LexArts Youth Council, art club students from William Wells Brown and
art club students from Cardinal Valley Elementary school. </p>
<p>The design will consist of a
dynamic color range and will have bees coming from the “hive” and pollinating
various native Kentucky flowers.
There will also be some native Kentucky birds integrated in the mural design.
The largest part of the mural will be on the wall that is facing the parking
lot (the South facing wall). The mural will also be painted on the top part of

owner of the Hive, and Michelle Armstrong, local artist and art teacher at
Cardinal Valley Elementary in Lexington, KY are working to raise funds to paint a mural of a beehive and
native KY flowers on the side of the Hive Salon at 156 Deweese Street in
downtown Lexington along with the help of some students from the area. The
goals of this project are to 1) revitalize Deweese Street and downtown Lex with
public art 2) engage community and students in creating art 3) raise awareness
of the declination of the honey bee population.
 The Hive is an important gathering place for
the downtown community and we would like to bring public art to this area of
Lexington and also raise awareness about the declination of the honeybee
population. We have invited several student groups to assist us in painting
this mural such as art club students from the 
Sisophromateum Art Foundation, students in the High Street YMCA summer
camp, the LexArts Youth Council, art club students from William Wells Brown and
art club students from Cardinal Valley Elementary school. 
The design will consist of a
dynamic color range and will have bees coming from the “hive” and pollinating
various native Kentucky flowers.
There will also be some native Kentucky birds integrated in the mural design.
The largest part of the mural will be on the wall that is facing the parking
lot (the South facing wall). The mural will also be painted on the top part of
the back wall and the top part of the North facing wall with extending flowers
so that the mural will create an effect that extends beyond the one wall and
effectively “wraps” the building in color (only the top part of the wall can be
seen from Elm Tree Lane).  The front
entrance will also be painted with another extension of bees/ flowers to tie

Update - June 22, 2015: We've added some new IndieGogo Perks - Your Own Glorious Infinity Mirror ($45 to $750 options)








‘Wonder of wonders! HOLD ONTO YOUR Knickers!


Prepare to be h​ypnotized,​
mesmerized,​and e​lectrified! ​


This attraction promises to bend reality to new levels as
yet unseen by the masses. Be among the first to reemerge reawakened and
revitalized from a reflective walk through The Gallery of Infinity! 

  



What is The Gallery of Infinity?
It’s a sideshow attraction displaying an array of various infinity mirrors to create wild effects and optical illusions within sprawling corridors. The installation involves walls built with layers of plexiglass sheets. Within the sheets, are LED bands that are hooked to proximity sensors to change colors schemes based on the movement of passing visitors. This structure creates a mind-boggling effect of colorful, dazzling lights that reflect into apparent infinity. Multiple walls will create an infinity mirror
system to offer an incredible visual experience and disorienting sense of reality
different from the one which many of us are accustomed to. These visuals will
push visitors to be more critical of the paths they navigate and compel them to
question the accuracy of their perceptions.

Perk: Personal Desktop Infinity Mirror













               A talker will attempt to lure passersby off the Midway, the spiel will tempt and entice them to dare to enter this mind altering reality and emerge differently from whence they came in. Many of us
autopilot through physical spaces, and have learned to not be especially critical of our own biases and heuristics. These biases leave us vulnerable to spatial illusions, and that’s what we intend to exploit. 

               This infinity gallery illusion will provide a unique opportunity to inspect physical spaces with a more discerning eye, as visitors enjoy the ability to peer off into seemingly endless tunnels of light. This project promises to be a bizarre, eye opening experience, mildly disorienting and visually thrilling, while altering the visitors’ natural sensibilities to navigate through space.









  


Features & Goals

The base structure alone (including travel) is expected to cost at least $8,000. Additional features are included based on funding. Below is a diagram of our layout (black walls are infinity mirror panels) and some examples of what we plan to include:


A Body Sensing Camera and Reactive LED Wall
Using the Microsoft Kinect, one hallway of the installation will detect the shape of a person's body and project this onto a wall of LED strands. The colors will change for each person (e.g., body 1 = red, body 2 = green, etc.) and you can transfer color by touching one another. Below is an example of the camera in action!


MOVING Infinity Mirrors Powered by Motors

Motor Powered Infinity Panels? WHAT!? Yes. We will move the damn mirrors within the infinity panels using corkscrew motors to create an INSANE moving tunnel effect. We are working with a PhD student of computer engineering (robotics emphasis) to design movement within the infinity mirrors. This will be nuts.

Proximity & Motion Sensitive Hallways 


The infinity mirror walls will change based on the movement of people passing through and depending upon how close one is to approaching the wall. This will allow us to change hallways and light patterns depending on visitor location. For example, walls of light that seem to follow the visitor and then change color schemes and flash depending on location.

An infinite Playa Horizon  

Upon exiting, the last wall will have a long (width-­wise) infinity mirror that has lights only on the top and bottom of the mirror. This will create an infinite horizon effect as visitors exit the installation. The horizon will have black­light paint and EL wire to create landmark structures such as The Man and Temple of Promise. 

Hallway of Masks  

At eye level, one of the corridors will include multiple frames of infinity mirrors with holographic head­-sized stickers of various masks. As visitors pass through, they will be able to view their own reflections superimposed with the masks displayed in the mirror. 






Touch Interactive 3D Infinity Cubes & Pyramids
A 3-sided pyramid and 4-sided cube of connected infinity mirrors. The sides will have touch capacitive sensors so that the sculpture’s color changes based on the number of visitors touching it simultaneously. (For example, an entire pyramid is green with 1 touch, sides pulsate green & blue with 2 touches.)
Showcasing Local Artists
We're experimenting with different methods of using blacklight paint, EL wire and reflective objects to create infinity panels with -insane- effects for paintings. Local artists are invited to paint panels to showcase their works. Message us at Facebook.com/GalleryOfInfinity if you're interested!


And more...

Yes, more! Depending on funding, we can fill the space with different infinity sculptures and installations. The possibilities are essentially boundless, (or you could say infinite...) on what we can incorporate into this awesome attraction. 


If we reach...
$7,000 - It happens! We can include the hallway of masks, some reactive panels, but no sculptures. 
$8,000 - 724 sq feet of infinity panels with several surprise interactive ones.
$9,000 - We can make most infinity panels interactive &  include 2 touch-reactive sculptures.

We seek to provide a professional live performance venue named “The Artists’ Workshop” for aspiring artists to polish their craft in a safe and secure environment under the guidance and supervision of seasoned professionals. There will not be any food or beverages served and any revenue generated will be through donations offered to our non-profit organization. We will also invite leading professional artists in all genres to conduct Master Workshops on “Creative Sundays” which is every Sunday between 1:00pm and 6:00pm. Friday and Saturday evenings between 7:00pm and 9:00pm (youth) and 10:00pm to 1:00pm (young adults) will be reserved for live performances on an open mic format. We estimate that our costs will be as follows: renovation to men’s and women’s bathrooms and changing areas = $14:000; electrical upgrades and lighting = $5,000; installation of improved heating and air-conditioning = $7,000; improvements to entrance, hallways and staircases =$7,000; signage inside and outside $3,000; total cost estimated $35,000. Any funds received towards this goal will be used in part or total for its intended purpose. We will continue to raise funds until the work is completed.</p>
<p>The Artists’ Workshop will provide a venue and means for youth to have greater voice in expressing what is and is not meaningful to them while providing adults an opportunity to hear from them directly on how to assist and provide them with what they need to thrive. </p>
<p><b>MISSION:The Hung Tao Choy Mei Leadership Institutes</b> “We use our intense African and Chinese Traditional Cultural Arts of kung fu, lion and dragon dance, and drumming training to instill in our participants the character traits of self-reliance, personal responsibility, to strive for excellence, and to become successful adults and leaders in their chosen fields and prepare them to live a meaningful life. <b>VISION:</b> Through the power of our values and commitment to excellence in the traditional African and Chinese cultural arts, the HTCMLI will become the region’s leading center of excellence for youth development</p>
<p><b>History:  </b>The Hung Tao Choy Mei Leadership Institute was founded in 1995 by Abdur-Rahim Muhammad a native Washingtonian.  President Muhammad opened the Institute at 1351 U at a time when many home owners and businesses were hesitant to invest in the area and began teaching children few thought worthy of their attention. He trained these children and sponsored their trips (over 50 local children and youth) to competitions in Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Mainland China and they returned home as kung fu champions holding numerous gold, silver, and bronze medals for their efforts and huge boosts to their pride and self-esteem.

We seek to provide a professional live performance venue named “The Artists’ Workshop” for aspiring artists to polish their craft in a safe and secure environment under the guidance and supervision of seasoned professionals. There will not be any food or beverages served and any revenue generated will be through donations offered to our non-profit organization. We will also invite leading professional artists in all genres to conduct Master Workshops on “Creative Sundays” which is every Sunday between 1:00pm and 6:00pm. Friday and Saturday evenings between 7:00pm and 9:00pm (youth) and 10:00pm to 1:00pm (young adults) will be reserved for live performances on an open mic format. We estimate that our costs will be as follows: renovation to men’s and women’s bathrooms and changing areas = $14:000; electrical upgrades and lighting = $5,000; installation of improved heating and air-conditioning = $7,000; improvements to entrance, hallways and staircases =$7,000; signage inside and outside $3,000; total cost estimated $35,000. Any funds received towards this goal will be used in part or total for its intended purpose. We will continue to raise funds until the work is completed.
The Artists’ Workshop will provide a venue and means for youth to have greater voice in expressing what is and is not meaningful to them while providing adults an opportunity to hear from them directly on how to assist and provide them with what they need to thrive. 
MISSION:The Hung Tao Choy Mei Leadership Institutes “We use our intense African and Chinese Traditional Cultural Arts of kung fu, lion and dragon dance, and drumming training to instill in our participants the character traits of self-reliance, personal responsibility, to strive for excellence, and to become successful adults and leaders in their chosen fields and prepare them to live a meaningful life. VISION: Through the power of our values and commitment to excellence in the traditional African and Chinese cultural arts, the HTCMLI will become the region’s leading center of excellence for youth development
History:  The Hung Tao Choy Mei Leadership Institute was founded in 1995 by Abdur-Rahim Muhammad a native Washingtonian.  President Muhammad opened the Institute at 1351 U at a time when many home owners and businesses were hesitant to invest in the area and began teaching children few thought worthy of their attention. He trained these children and sponsored their trips (over 50 local children and youth) to competitions in Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Mainland China and they returned home as kung fu champions holding numerous gold, silver, and bronze medals for their efforts and huge boosts to their pride and self-esteem. The Institute is recognized worldwide as one of the leading traditional martial arts organizations in the United States. “The Council of the District of Columbia recognizes and supports the Hung Tao Choy Mei Leadership Institute and in celebration of this milestone declares November 3, 2009, as the “Hung Tao Choy Mei Leadership Institute's Lion Dance and Kung Fu Champions Recognition Day” in the District  of Columbia.”
The Leadership Institute produces the annual Paul Robeson ""Here I Stand"" Award Gala at the 
Lincoln Theater featuring world class entertainers and scholars such as Harry Belafonte, Danny Glover, Paul Robeson Jr., Dick Gregory, Dr. John Hope Franklin, Judith Jamison, Rita Moreno, Spike Lee, and hip hop legends “Common” and Chuck D of Public Enemy the hip hop group recently inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.  The Institute has been providing Out of School time programs for DC Children since 1995 and free full day summer camps since 2007.

<div><p>The Sable Project is a different kind of artist residency.

In short, our first year was a resounding success, and now we want to do it all again! </p>
<p></p>
<h3>What's New?</h3>
<p>Last summer was an amazing learning process, and this year we know we can make  The Sable Project even better. There have already been a bunch of changes, and many more in the works. Here's what's new!</p>
<ul>
<li>We are a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit organization now. That means that we are now able to apply for grants and all of your donations are <b>TAX DEDUCTIBLE!</b>
</li>
<li>We are growing a huge garden and running a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program.

</ul>
<h3>Why Indiegogo Again? </h3>
<p>This summer we are once again hosting young, emerging artists. However, that means that our residents are often not financially able to pay for expensive programs. Because of this, we have decided that it is important and necessary to offer the residency at zero cost to our artists. </p>
<p>We only just recently received our new non-profit status, and as such were not able to apply to as many grants or alternative funding sources as we needed to make this second year a possibility.

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p></p>
<p><b>About the book and installation:</b></p>
<p>The starting point of the narrative is a childhood’s memory: ""when I was a child, I thought that at least one forgotten house existed somewhere, preferably in the woods, where I could discretely settle. If I scroll through my memory, I have a very precise image of that house, I even feel that it truly exists. What would happen if one day this imaginary house ended up in the real world?""</p>
<p>As the book unfolds, the darkening pages make the text illegible. With LA MAISON OUBLIEE/THE FORGOTTEN HOUSE, the book as object is part of the narrative, and the slow movement of the 105 pages towards complete darkness is right away perceived as a key narrative element by the reader.</p>
<p><b>About the performance:</b></p>
<p>The actress Emilie Gruat and the musician Denis Schuler genuinely crafted this art installation into a theater and musical experience. At the end of their performance, the theater becomes a gallery and the performance a vernissage. Denis Schuler’s instruments (glasses filled with water, as ephemeral organs) also become elements of the exhibition.</p>

<h3>ORIGIN STORY</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The origin story of the San Francisco Oracle is a little weird, but what else would you expect? Last September, it seemed that the stars aligned and the sky cracked open and started revealing a deck of oracle cards based on the history of bohemian life in San Francisco. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580339145/ume8wqri2bhmk1ngr9sw.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We drew the first raw symbols from the stars onto blank bridge cards and then met in the shadow of the Golden Gate Bridge to give each other the first readings from an oracle that would go on to *build itself* as it grew through our <strong>test-readings of San Franciscans from all walks of life.</strong> After the original reading under the bridge, we sketched more cards and fine tuned the divination system by giving a series of test readings for individuals in our community here in the Bay. These early playtesters had experience with oracle cards, and told us how relatable they found the symbols we chose, educating us on some of the nuances, and sending us back to the drawing board for refinements. As we worked, we found the inspiring stories and dreams of our early playtesters worked their way into the final product, giving it texture and life. If you live here, you know how easy it is for San Francisco to get down on itself, and while we had our cranky days, we were repeatedly buoyed by the vision of <strong>creating a tool that reflected not so much how we see the city, but by how our playtester’s reactions to the prototype illuminated the attitude and approach that defines the revolutionary creativity of San Francisco culture.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580241847/a1s1f8monwsoyv09bwj8.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We then polished our new oracle to a shine by exposing it to every kind of San Franciscan we could; librarians, trapeze artists, rideshare drivers, hackers, the brunch crowd, psychedelic gurus, florists, Lowell High School teachers, landscape architects, hapless entrepreneurs caught in the swirling vortex of OracleCon at Moscone center, newspaper journalists, nurses, SEO quants, conspiracy bloggers, grass-roots historians, cable car operators, pianists, recruiters, Northbeach barflies, our innocent families, and one lucky cryptocurrency millionaire who just quit his job in pursuit of the questing beast. Nearly all gave inspiring insights in response to their test readings, and many of those insights found their way into the final design. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this way, <strong>The San Francisco Oracle is in large part a community effort</strong>, and we are deeply grateful for the opportunity we’ve had to share the creation story of the deck with so many friends both new and old.</p>

<p>What makes this limited edition of <i>'Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There'</i> a must-have? This book is going to live up to the legacy of the original <i>'Alice in Wonderland'</i> that we illustrated and published back in 2008 (more details below). That project was a great success, having been meticulously illustrated and prepared, while sparing no expense on printing and binding - a true collector's item. After many years of hard work, putting great care into illustrations, we are ready to complete the sequel. What we need now is your help to fund the printing and binding process.</p>
<p>We are proud to dedicate this edition to the 150th Anniversary of publishing the <i>'Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There'</i> which we will celebrate next year (1871—2021).</p>
<p> </p>

<p> Lewis Carroll's masterpiece 'Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There' is the sequel to his 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'. So, all this is not about the first book? Well, that's because it, 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' was already published in 2008, then in 2009. This work received a lot of favorable reviews and I was awarded by IBBY for illustrations. </p>
<p>Of course, I wasn’t going to stop there, and continued to work on the second story about Alice — ‘Looking Glass’. There was a lot of sketching, composing, character development, etc. Time after time the 'Looking-Glass' was put aside for other projects, one of which was the illustrating and publishing of 'The Hunting of the Snark' by Lewis Carroll. Nevertheless, despite several breaks and intermissions, the work continued up to this day, and now we are very close to the end. We would much appreciate your support in bringing this book to life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1587079954/fhbtkeodss6t3tk3pd4u.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>A long-long time ago when I read Alice first time I was charmed by Carroll's world. Naturally, I began drawing, sketching, doodling - visualizing Alice my own way, ""cause I'm a damn artist"". </p>
<p> In the beginning, there were no plans to publish my drawings. My obsession with Alice's visualization had a form of an endless and unpredictable game with characters, situations, adventures, and nonsense. Each time I reread the book I found new details, new aspects of the conversations or circumstances, which I had missed before. It doesn't matter whether you are an observant, meticulous reader or not — Carroll is a magician, his literary techniques are often similar to an illusionist's craft. A single passage can be read seven times, but suddenly, on the eighth time, you notice an obvious detail and think to yourself: ""how in the world could I have missed this before?"" </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1587080003/jpugmyoanqlqgfrosbdk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>  I drew characters, composed scenes, invented costumes and surroundings, everything was getting “curiouser and curiouser”. I just could not stop, it became an obsessive occupation, a kind of hobby, a favorite pastime. And at some point, I realized that all this madness must be turned into something, into a book. So, I collected all the graphic works and began to collate them into a series of illustrations with a coherent style for a book.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<div>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LTYt84bIzNQ?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
</div>
<p>While reading ""Alice"", sometimes it is hard to understand what unites some parts of the book. Each chapter looks like an isolated event that isn't related to any other; different characters, locations, and events can be easily changed, can be rearranged, without losing the coherence of the story.</p>
<p>English is my second language, so some of the finer words and nuances elude me to this day, but at some point, I stumbled upon the word ""scene"" and thought it a perfect fit to describe each chapter. Yes, these chapters really look like theatrical acts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1587080612/kp2wjvld2fxhz9g2sns9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Carroll starts the chapter like this:</p>
<p>     “There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them…”</p>
<p>Doesn't this remind you of the mise-en-scene (arrangement of the stage) in a play? Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) was very fond of theater, theatricality, and stage performance, and this love helped him to write and construct the story about Alice. Based on this idea, I built myself a peculiar image of the curtain, so the illustration as a whole consists of:</p>
<p>     1) The main part of the drawing executed in brown color.</p>
<p>     2) Frame or a kind of curtain, drawn in black and white with graphite pencil.</p>
<p>This curtain not only frames the illustration, but also tells “its own” story, explains to us some details of conversations, verses, thoughts, and/or various literary, cultural and historical reminiscences. </p>

What makes this limited edition of 'Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There' a must-have? This book is going to live up to the legacy of the original 'Alice in Wonderland' that we illustrated and published back in 2008 (more details below). That project was a great success, having been meticulously illustrated and prepared, while sparing no expense on printing and binding - a true collector's item. After many years of hard work, putting great care into illustrations, we are ready to complete the sequel. What we need now is your help to fund the printing and binding process.
We are proud to dedicate this edition to the 150th Anniversary of publishing the 'Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There' which we will celebrate next year (1871—2021).
 

 Lewis Carroll's masterpiece 'Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There' is the sequel to his 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'. So, all this is not about the first book? Well, that's because it, 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' was already published in 2008, then in 2009. This work received a lot of favorable reviews and I was awarded by IBBY for illustrations. 
Of course, I wasn’t going to stop there, and continued to work on the second story about Alice — ‘Looking Glass’. There was a lot of sketching, composing, character development, etc. Time after time the 'Looking-Glass' was put aside for other projects, one of which was the illustrating and publishing of 'The Hunting of the Snark' by Lewis Carroll. Nevertheless, despite several breaks and intermissions, the work continued up to this day, and now we are very close to the end. We would much appreciate your support in bringing this book to life.
 

A long-long time ago when I read Alice first time I was charmed by Carroll's world. Naturally, I began drawing, sketching, doodling - visualizing Alice my own way, ""cause I'm a damn artist"". 
 In the beginning, there were no plans to publish my drawings. My obsession with Alice's visualization had a form of an endless and unpredictable game with characters, situations, adventures, and nonsense. Each time I reread the book I found new details, new aspects of the conversations or circumstances, which I had missed before. It doesn't matter whether you are an observant, meticulous reader or not — Carroll is a magician, his literary techniques are often similar to an illusionist's craft. A single passage can be read seven times, but suddenly, on the eighth time, you notice an obvious detail and think to yourself: ""how in the world could I have missed this before?"" 
 

  I drew characters, composed scenes, invented costumes and surroundings, everything was getting “curiouser and curiouser”. I just could not stop, it became an obsessive occupation, a kind of hobby, a favorite pastime. And at some point, I realized that all this madness must be turned into something, into a book. So, I collected all the graphic works and began to collate them into a series of illustrations with a coherent style for a book.
 


 

While reading ""Alice"", sometimes it is hard to understand what unites some parts of the book. Each chapter looks like an isolated event that isn't related to any other; different characters, locations, and events can be easily changed, can be rearranged, without losing the coherence of the story.
English is my second language, so some of the finer words and nuances elude me to this day, but at some point, I stumbled upon the word ""scene"" and thought it a perfect fit to describe each chapter. Yes, these chapters really look like theatrical acts.
 

Carroll starts the chapter like this:
     “There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them…”
Doesn't this remind you of the mise-en-scene (arrangement of the stage) in a play? Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) was very fond of theater, theatricality, and stage performance, and this love helped him to write and construct the story about Alice. Based on this idea, I built myself a peculiar image of the curtain, so the illustration as a whole consists of:
     1) The main part of the drawing executed in brown color.
     2) Frame or a kind of curtain, drawn in black and white with graphite pencil.
This curtain not only frames the illustration, but also tells “its own” story, explains to us some details of conversations, verses, thoughts, and/or various literary, cultural and historical reminiscences.

<h3>The Art Book</h3>
<p>I have been a horror fan all my life and I’ve always wanted to create a terrifying horror world of my own. Being an artist working in the game industry, it was natural for me to approach the project with a sketchbook first. A simple sketch became a painting, a page of story became six months worth of writing...the moment I thought I was done with everything, a new idea had me opening my sketchbook again. After so many sketchbooks and bottles of Bushmills, in late 2017 I finally put my foot down and told myself that I’m going to have my closure on the project by making an art book out of it. The art of Year Of The Ladybug omits a few things  but it holds large amount of visions I had for this world I created. With your love and support, it is my sincere belief that we can finish this book so that we are one step closer to the game. I had so much fun working on it, and I hope that you will love it as much as I do. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The tricky thing about making an art book for a game that doesn’t exist is deciding on what to share and what not to. Since most art books are read and appreciated after finishing the game, not spoiling the story was an obvious choice but how much of the visuals do you share when you are both trying to get people interested and hoping to see the game in future? I did what I can do to balance it and I hope that you will find this book amusing enough until we have the game. </p>

<h3>Queer artists deserve to be paid. Help us participate in the NFT movement!</h3>
<p>My name is Ruby Powers and I’m an artist and do-gooder in New York City. In my years of doing drag, I’ve seen it all. And sometimes the audience has, too! </p>
<p>But one thing I’ve noticed is that the <strong>economics of being a queer artist are not easy. </strong>When I heard about cryptocurrency and NFTs, I realized that this was a financial movement I couldn’t let pass me by. I wanted to learn the game and bring my friends along with me.</p>
<p>That is why I am launching <strong>The Queenly NFT, a cryptogallery for queer artists.</strong><br/> </p>
<h3>Let me start by explaining NFTs.</h3>
<p>NFT stands for non-fungible token. Any piece of content, like art, photography, or music can become a NFT. Think of it like an official digital record of a work--stored in blockchain. And NFTs are being <strong>bought and sold as digital collectibles</strong> sometimes for hundreds, thousands, or millions of dollars.<br/> </p>
<h3><strong>Here's how my gallery will work.</strong></h3>
<p>Dozens of amazing artists from iconic photographers, to viral musicians, to the most legendary drag queens will exhibit their work via The Queenly NFT. And investors will buy or bid on their work!</p>
<p>From there, creators get fair compensation, plus a donation to their charity of choice! Then, if their NFTs sell again, they even get a cut of those future sales! </p>
<p>Selling an important work in this way could have huge impact on the financial health and livelihood of the artists involved.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Here's what we need.</h3>
<p>I’ve been bootstrapping this project so far and my budget is stretched tighter than my corset. My original plan was to hunker down and make this work with credit cards–but that financial advice is not Ruby-approved for my friends or for myself!</p>
<p><strong>I need to raise about $10,000 to kickstart my idea. </strong>This will help me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bring on the staff I need to do contract review</li>
<li>Cover start up costs like LLC registration, website, bookkeeping, business checking, etc. </li>
<li>Pay for ads and publicity to spread the message about queer inclusion!</li>
<li>Throw the best fancy launch event that this project deserves<br/> </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The LGBT+ community needs help when it comes to fair finance.</h3>
<p>Queer people, especially queer people of color and queer women, are often behind in financial literacy–and we often get taken advantage of. Queer people already have NFTs of their work being sold and they are not always consenting or getting compensated! This gallery will be a place that investors can trust will do right by the creators.</p>
<p>On a wider level, this gallery will prove that queer people are capable and ready to participate in the future of finance. <i>Did you know that queer people with mortgages pay an average of 2% more than straight people? </i>There are so many ways that queer people lag when it comes to equal opportunity and this gallery wants to help change that.</p>

I’ve been bootstrapping this project so far and my budget is stretched tighter than my corset. My original plan was to hunker down and make this work with credit cards–but that financial advice is not Ruby-approved for my friends or for myself!
I need to raise about $10,000 to kickstart my idea. This will help me:

Bring on the staff I need to do contract review
Cover start up costs like LLC registration, website, bookkeeping, business checking, etc. 
Pay for ads and publicity to spread the message about queer inclusion!
Throw the best fancy launch event that this project deserves 


The LGBT+ community needs help when it comes to fair finance.
Queer people, especially queer people of color and queer women, are often behind in financial literacy–and we often get taken advantage of. Queer people already have NFTs of their work being sold and they are not always consenting or getting compensated! This gallery will be a place that investors can trust will do right by the creators.
On a wider level, this gallery will prove that queer people are capable and ready to participate in the future of finance. Did you know that queer people with mortgages pay an average of 2% more than straight people? There are so many ways that queer people lag when it comes to equal opportunity and this gallery wants to help change that.
 
Help me make 'herstory' by launching the first ever cryptogallery for queer creators. ❤️",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

After a 5 year sail, we're sad to announce the sinking of our Lugano vessel.  She was a mighty ship and will be missed.  No need for lifejackets just yet!  We're in the process of finding a new home for A SHIP IN THE WOODS, one worthy of charting even greater waters, but we need your help. We have until July 31st to relocate. Reaching our goal of $100,000 will aid in the transition of Ship 2.0.
We will use the money for the following: stipends for artists, developing our residency program, small amount of pay for some of our volunteers, defray some daily operations costs, shipping and handling of artwork, transportation costs, educational material, and marketing.WHAT YOUR HELP SUPPORTSResidency Program: The residency provides a free space for innovative thinkers or anyone working on contemporary issues, a space to think and work on projects or use the time to discuss their message and ideas with the public that is vital for cultural change.Events: We host group art exhibitions, film screenings, musical performances, writers, researchers, happenings and other cultural discussions regarding the world as we know it. Collaborations: We encourage interdisciplinary collaborations which are often created through connections made at our events.  Our small staff of three relies on the contributions of volunteers and student volunteers who receive school credit for their participation. In exchange for their help in managing our events, they are given the opportunity to connect and interact with some of the best minds and cultural leaders in our community. The programming for many of our past events directly acknowledges current cultural and social debates, regarding sustainability, climate change, gender equality and many more urgent topics of discussion. We've exhibited grad students, and professors from many major local universities, including HELM, a series of solo exhibitions curated by UCSD PhD candidate Lara Bullock. We have participated in ARTSD'14, San Diego's premiere art fair in Balboa Park. Our installation, Rhodopsin, was a featured exhibition and collaborative project that featured student architects from the New School of Architecture and Design, SALK researcher John Reynolds, musician Greg Smaller and the research of world renown Harvard vision scientist Patrick Cavanagh. We have recently met with the Cabrillo National Park Service and are in discussions to help them organize several cultural events and artist residency program later this year.RHODOPSINRhodopsin is an original, collaborative light installation organized by WSOHOIDPS (A SHIP IN THE WOODS) created for the 2014 ART SD Contemporary Art Fair and it embodies the foundation’s ongoing efforts to blur the lines between art and science. The singular art experience is a collaboration between WSOHOIDPS co-founder RJ Brooks, Salk Institute neurobiologist John Reynolds, sound artist Greg Smaller, Paradox design team from New School of Architecture+ Design, and researcher Daw-An Wu. Based on the research of Patrick Cavanagh, who studies visual phenomena, Rhodopsin aims to encourage visitors to think about the process of perception and consider the brain’s role in actively constructing, rather than simply relaying, reality. We appreciate all the love and contributions from fellow shipmates, friends, and volunteers over the years.  The reason why we continue and exist is because of you.  With your help we'll be able to continue these elevated dialogues and collaborations in art, science, and culture. Our possession of this world we have made ours is a grand larceny. And its victim is the commonwealth: the land, the genome, mother culture. We could say that property is what has been stolen from us all, or from Nature, or from God. In any event, our progressive ownership of the world naturally and inevitably accompanies our progressive estrangement from the world, so that in the end we languish in the prison of me and mine which, no matter how great our possessions, is far narrower and dingier than the unbounded Wild from whence we came.""  –  Charles Eisenstein, ""The Ascent of Humanity""",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Olive, a 23 year-old Philadelphia native with a (growing) red afro. 
I'm a fun person to hang out with-- I love video games and art and all 
that good stuff. A lot of my creative roots come from the animes as you 
could have figured, but a good majority of it came from video games. 
Megaman X, Crash Bandicoot, Spyro, Burnout Revenge,  and the Metroid Prime 
Trilogy are a few of my childhood favorites, and some of them even 
inspired me to do what I do! </p>
<p>Recently my fiance told me about the magical world that is Long Beach Comic Con, and I've been gunning for hosting a table there as I stake my ground in the indie world. I've recently paid for the table and everything-- but now I gotta populate it. <br/></p>
<p><i>Oh dear.</i></p>
<p>That's where YOU come in-- you super cool person. ❤</p>
<p>This campaign was started to help me kick off my Artist Alley debut with a BANG! Hand-crafted jewelry and art, custom prints and trinkets, smiles and laughs, and so much more are on the horizon and you can help me get there!</p>

The first book will be a special edition of my second novel (to be published by the end of this year), and the second will be a special printed edition of a <a href=""http://www.deviantart.com/tag/megamanxhybrid"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Megaman inspired comic</a> I did this year.

So far, shirts and wristbands are on the back burner.<br/><p></p>
<ul><li><h4>What Happens If...?</h4></li></ul>
<p>If we don't raise all the funds in time, that's fine! You'll still get your prizes and smile with the knowledge that you still helped a goof like me make a great first impression on the indie artist community. <br/></p>

</div> <div> <h3><a name=""important"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Why You are Vital</a></h3>I'll be honest-- a lot of things wouldn't be possible if not for the amazing people that support indie artists like me. You are a crucial part of getting the ball rolling. Through this campaign, I hope to create a good lasting impression at LBCC, and a good portion of making this happen comes from YOU! As you can tell this kind of stuff adds up, and my income alone can't cover it. So that's where teamwork comes in! Together we'll be an amazing team; we'll vote on designs, come up with 
awesome content, and so much more. We'll take the 
indie art world by storm! Or SOMETHING! If you guys have any suggestions or feedback, I'm open to those! I love interacting with people!<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3><a name=""challengeaccept"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Challenge ACCEPTED!</a></h3>
<h3><a name=""challengeaccept"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></h3>I've got a lot of skills and what have you behind me that will prove handy during this campaign and on the convention floor. If there's one skill I can use, it's my resourcefulness. My fiance has given me good advice on how to tackle this thing, like how the first time being in an Artist's Alley isn't guaranteed to be fruitful/profitable. And you know what-- I get that. There's one thing that I can say, and that's that there's more to it than how much I can make. There's the experience of being in the mix, and that's what I'm looking most forward to. <br/>
<p>It takes a lot of initiative and perseverance to lead a successful campaign like this, and I guarantee I'll make you guys proud. Even in my short time in the <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/magicalmeetup/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MeetUp community</a>, for example, I've managed to lead 2 successful hangouts. It wasn't how many people attended or how much was raised, but rather the experience we sculpted together. Ask any one of the artists who attended those hangouts and they'll tell you they had a pretty good time! The same can be said for a handful of young artists who follow me on deviantART. I seem to have this magical ability to inspire people, and that alone humbles me.<br/></p>
<p>Gosh, I sound like I'm running for class president or something, aren't I? Bottom line is this-- I am bound and determined to <b>make you proud</b>. I'll update you with each and every development, and you're free to ask me questions about the campaign, rewards, my projects, my appearance in artist's alley, or even me as a person. I love answering questions, and I'm also here to help. <br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3><a name=""youcanhelp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""I'm SUPER Excited! But How Can I Help?""</a></h3>
<p>Let me tell you-- word-of-mouth does wonders. A lot of people I follow today I wouldn't have found if not for a close friend/family member telling me about them.

Donate $50+ and get a portrait of you drawn by Olive for the special thanks section! :D

Above is a small sample of what it'd look like. ;3 <3Basically, I'll draw you as you'd appear in A Cup of Sugar! 


Here's a sample of the portraits; it's for my first supporter, Iris Patton!

Hey, Hello!!

Hey there! I'm Olive, a 23 year-old Philadelphia native with a (growing) red afro. 
I'm a fun person to hang out with-- I love video games and art and all 
that good stuff. A lot of my creative roots come from the animes as you 
could have figured, but a good majority of it came from video games. 
Megaman X, Crash Bandicoot, Spyro, Burnout Revenge,  and the Metroid Prime 
Trilogy are a few of my childhood favorites, and some of them even 
inspired me to do what I do! 
Recently my fiance told me about the magical world that is Long Beach Comic Con, and I've been gunning for hosting a table there as I stake my ground in the indie world. I've recently paid for the table and everything-- but now I gotta populate it. 
Oh dear.
That's where YOU come in-- you super cool person. ❤
This campaign was started to help me kick off my Artist Alley debut with a BANG! Hand-crafted jewelry and art, custom prints and trinkets, smiles and laughs, and so much more are on the horizon and you can help me get there!

 
Okay, So Here's the Plan:

I've already paid for the registration and the Artist's Alley table. I'm also doing research to reduce costs as much as possible. Now it's a matter of teaming up with the Internet to get everything funded! CLICK HERE TO SEE WHAT I HAVE PLANNED OUT! 

Ah, But I'd NEVER Forget About YOU! ;3




Supporting me gets you amazing perks that will give you +99999 fabulous points. Whadayamean that's not a real attribute? HSHSHSH

Secret Digital Treats!
Concept sketches, icons, patterns, and more will be readily available at your fingertips! I tend to publish secret goodies at the end of every month, so your inbox will be graced with monthly goodies! :D
I'm in the motion of scanning in my second sketch journal that will be free for YOU. <3
BONUS: Supporter-Exclusive Comics! You will be one of the lucky viewers to see A Cup of Sugar and all its bonus content! 

YOUR NAME in a Book + Animation
Yep! I'm currently working on a novel that I will self publish to lulu.com. But wait, there's more! Your name will be in not only one, but TWO books and an ANIMATION! The first book will be a special edition of my second novel (to be published by the end of this year), and the second will be a special printed edition of a Megaman inspired comic I did this year. The animation is a promotion for my personal project TwistedFates and features the voice of Kevan Brighting (the narrator from The Stanley Parable).

Custom ART!Certain Tiers will get custom art. You can get a portrait of anyone as they'd appear in my story, or if you want to get orribu'd, that's fine too. :3c
""I hate the word 'Swag'!""Me too! But that's the best I can do to cover my grounds. You'll get button badges that tell the world how awesome you are, stickers, a bookmark, prints, and whatever we vote on in the course of this campaign. So far, shirts and wristbands are on the back burner.
What Happens If...?
If we don't raise all the funds in time, that's fine! You'll still get your prizes and smile with the knowledge that you still helped a goof like me make a great first impression on the indie artist community. 


Supporters can now vote on their fave bookmark design! C:
  Why You are VitalI'll be honest-- a lot of things wouldn't be possible if not for the amazing people that support indie artists like me. You are a crucial part of getting the ball rolling. Through this campaign, I hope to create a good lasting impression at LBCC, and a good portion of making this happen comes from YOU! As you can tell this kind of stuff adds up, and my income alone can't cover it. So that's where teamwork comes in! Together we'll be an amazing team; we'll vote on designs, come up with 
awesome content, and so much more. We'll take the 
indie art world by storm! Or SOMETHING! If you guys have any suggestions or feedback, I'm open to those! I love interacting with people!
  Challenge ACCEPTED!
I've got a lot of skills and what have you behind me that will prove handy during this campaign and on the convention floor. If there's one skill I can use, it's my resourcefulness. My fiance has given me good advice on how to tackle this thing, like how the first time being in an Artist's Alley isn't guaranteed to be fruitful/profitable. And you know what-- I get that. There's one thing that I can say, and that's that there's more to it than how much I can make. There's the experience of being in the mix, and that's what I'm looking most forward to. 
It takes a lot of initiative and perseverance to lead a successful campaign like this, and I guarantee I'll make you guys proud. Even in my short time in the MeetUp community, for example, I've managed to lead 2 successful hangouts. It wasn't how many people attended or how much was raised, but rather the experience we sculpted together. Ask any one of the artists who attended those hangouts and they'll tell you they had a pretty good time! The same can be said for a handful of young artists who follow me on deviantART. I seem to have this magical ability to inspire people, and that alone humbles me.
Gosh, I sound like I'm running for class president or something, aren't I? Bottom line is this-- I am bound and determined to make you proud. I'll update you with each and every development, and you're free to ask me questions about the campaign, rewards, my projects, my appearance in artist's alley, or even me as a person. I love answering questions, and I'm also here to help. 

  ""I'm SUPER Excited! But How Can I Help?""
Let me tell you-- word-of-mouth does wonders. A lot of people I follow today I wouldn't have found if not for a close friend/family member telling me about them. I remember how my friend Brittany in high school introduced me to the Angry Video Game Nerd during Italian class. Since then I've followed him and gotten a lot of laughs from his part of the internet. 
You'll probably see a lot of ""Draw my Life"" videos where the star of the show tells people their story about their rise to Youtube fame.

ephemeral artists. They will bring their work from all over Australia and 
run free workshops to engage the local community. These artists will work 
with local land care groups, the community, environmental groups and schools to create installations which 
speak of a love for nature and art.  The first community artwork is finished, it involved 704 community members who made ceramic sea creature tiles. We have been working tirelessly behind 
the scenes to ensure a great event for everyone involved. But now 
we need your help.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why do we need your help?<br/>
</h3>
<p>We will use the money donated to fund free workshops for the community

installation costs and fund a permanent work. This permanent work uses 
indigenous plants to create a unique, environmental artwork by 
nationally recognized artist Joanne Mott.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Here is what you will get for your money:</h3> Check out the rewards(perks), there are
 ceramic tiles made by local artists,

This project essentially formed with the intention of spreading the work of Ecuadorian musicians residing elsewhere, in this case Argentina . We want people from other parts of the world to listen and care for the cultural scene that is generated in our country.

Created by musicians from different parts of Ecuador residents in the city of Buenos Aires (Argentina), in the month of August 2015 we had the opportunity to record our compositions in Sound Rec (Buenos Aires), for what would be the first record of this assembly, what we need right now it is financial support to complete the process of disk and so this may come to light.

<p>Nous vous  remercions de contribuer<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> à la première édition d</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">’AABF d’exister lors de la 12e biennale internationale de Dakar / Dak’Art 2016.</span></p>

<p><strong>Impact</strong></p>
<p>African Art Book Fair (AABF), présente les éditeurs d’art indépendants. C’est le premier salon du genre en Afrique. L’AABF comprend plus de 20 éditeurs internationaux, avec un accent particulier sur les publications et les approches expérimentales de l'édition, l'impression et l'écriture d'artistes.</p>
<p>La genèse de ce projet date de la biennale de Dakar de 2014, au regard à la fois de la carence de l’écrit et de la critique et du regain de la circulation des œuvres d’art contemporain Africain, dans le monde et sa présence dans les principales manifestations.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Pour réaliser ce projet un travail de prospection, consultation et conseil a été mené avec partage et passion et engagement pour l’amour de l’art…</p>
<p><strong>1. Nous avons sélectionné des éditeurs</strong></p>
<p>Le choix de la programmation repose sur une sélection de publications, d’éditeurs, d’artistes dont la pertinence de l’offre est en relation avec l'état actuel du monde, par ses composantes, technologique, esthétique, critique, géopolitique et environnementale. Toute une richesse !</p>
<p>Plusieurs éditeurs indépendants issus de l’Afrique et de l’Amérique du Sud ne peuvent pas venir car le coût des billets d’avion est trop élevé.</p>
<p>La solution de cette difficulté et de faire venir leur publications et de faire appel à des bénévoles engagés sur place, grâce à notre travail de lien sur le terrain</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong>2. Nous avons établi une programmation</strong></p>
<p>Des invités de choix, vont montrer, analyser, discuter de plusieurs productions différentes qui vont souligner la qualité de la production éditoriale en termes de forme et de contenu.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong>3. Nous avons invité des artistes, des curateurs, des médiateurs pour animer ces journées de foire</strong></p>
<p>Le fait que ce milieu de l’édition soit sinistré, a rendu difficile le déplacement des éditeurs sur le plan financier, en dépit de l’intérêt pour la manifestation. D’ailleurs les les institutions n’ont pas répondu à notre requête d’être financé en partie.</p>
<p>Notre collectif est bénévole, les projets que nous menons, sont portés par notre passion de défendre l’art et la critique.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Aujourd’hui, nous sommes à quelques jours de la biennale, et plus que jamais, nous avons besoin de votre soutien !</p>
<p><strong>1. Nous sollicitons des partenaires à différents niveaux de collaboration pour permettre à cette foire d’exister</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Une fois la collecte honorée, nous partirons à Dakar pour mettre en place cette foire du livre en terme de dispositifs, de stands et de finaliser la communication</strong></p>
<p>Cette foire d’art du livre permettra au publique et aux professionnels du monde de l art de découvrir les meilleurs publications qui se font sur le continent Africain.</p>
<p>Favoriser l’échange et les circulations des savoirs. Les éditeurs indépendants pourront échanger et faire découvrir leurs dernières publications.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong>D'autres façons d'aider</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>

<p>Favoriser l’échange et les circulations des savoirs. Les éditeurs indépendants feront découvrir leurs dernières publications.</p>
<p>L’AABF, se positionne en tant qu’une entité itinérante qui s’invitera au sein des foires, salons, et biennales. La carence de la production critique menace aujourd’hui la transmission de l’art contemporain d’Afrique et ses diasporas, en termes de contenu critique, d’analyse. L’AABF traversera les frontières afin de confirmer la nécessité incontournable de s’inscrire dans l’écrit et le sens et de mémoriser des formes nouvelles et contemporaines.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong>AABF du 04 au 8 mai, pendant la 12e biennale de Dakar</strong></p>

<p><strong><b>African Art Book Fair (AABF)™ /1re édition</b></strong></p>

<p></p>
<p>African Art Book Fair (AABF) is an art publication fair with a discussion forum concentrating on themes linked to art publications, photography, design, experimental music, open culture and activism. By underlining the best practices of these domains, we aim to offer to the members of these communities a context in which they can maintain their integrity, their critical voice and their social role when faced with external factors (the market, urbanism, or media…). </p>
<p>By recognizing and supporting unique and qualitative editorial practices African Art Book Fair wants to open up to a larger public, and put them in contact with the publishers, offline and online. The intersection between the different esthetic production fields is an integral part of the process. We want to put forward the editorial practices and the physicality of the book, as a medium and in its transcription towards other forms of media. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459240750/vskstos9pra8heclforg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The making of an art book fair during the Dakar Biennale! </p>
<p>Given that the fields of editing and publication in art are under-represented, Afrikadaa and its partners are offering to unite all African and diaspora art publications in order to allow for various types of experiential exchange between the editorial productions. We wish to contribute to the development of an editorial pole of art by working on the creation of an African Art Book Fair (AABF), on the African continent. </p>
<p>The idea to create an AABF that included all African contemporary Art organizations resulted from discussions at the symposium “Memory of the future,” organized by Afrikadaa during the last Dakar Biennale in 2014. Afrikadaa underlined the importance of defending the critical production and witnessing the evolution of an artistic period, especially in a context where we see that the desertion of writing will leave a huge hole in the construction of its history. Furthermore, Afrikadaa underlined the importance of relaying this information to future generations. The voluntary or unintentional eviction of books from biennales, art fairs, and other artistic events in Africa and the absence of magazines from the South in large international fairs, means there is an absence of critical content, esthetic debates about their times, and confrontations (sociological and ideological) of their work. This truly impoverishes the artistic world as a whole. Because of the drowning of the publication sector in Africa, we must encourage and uplift it through strong initiatives. We must encourage content worthy of critical acclaim, standard works, and artist books and unite to celebrate them during a fair dedicated to their existence. </p>
<p>In partnership with the Dakar Biennale, the African Art Book Fair and Raw Material are glad to present the first edition of this international art book Fair from May 2nd to 8th 2016, during the Dak’art Biennale. </p>
<p>African Art Book Fair  (AABF), offers a panel of large independent art editors from various countries in Africa, the Caribbean, the Americas and Europe. The AABF is the first exhibit of this type in Africa, and welcomes more than 30 international editors and spotlights publications offering experimental approaches to publishing, writing and the printing of works. </p>
<p>The African Art Book Fair was founded very recently, and underlines the production and distribution of art publishing, a relatively new domain that has become an essential part of contemporary art in the last few years. It is imperative that these efforts are supported on the continent of Africa. The art edition includes images and text in the experimental form of artist books, art writing and magazines collectively edited, critical revues, and photography books. In this fertile field, the work of international artists is made available to the public through affordable editions, while offering an alternative to biennales, galleries, and museums. </p>
<p>African Art Book Fair was founded by a group of artists and art critics who were worried about the production of critique in southern territories, and who were engaged in art publication in the international scene. </p>
<p>The team : Hafida Jemni, Camille Moulonguet, Pascale Obolo and Jay Ramier, Lucy Topaloff, and Stephanie Bonnet (and support from its members). </p>
<p>The African Art Book Fair questions the different ways of writing the esthetic contents of all contemporary art publications. It strives to collaborate with international institutions and individuals interested in the production of African contemporary art, design, architecture, conception, and publishing. </p>
<p>The program was chosen by a select group of publications, editors, and artists who are in touch with the current state of the world, its technology, esthetic, critique, geopolitics and environment. This is a huge richness! </p>
<p>This art book fair will allow the public and professionals in the art world to discover the best publications on the African continent. It will encourage exchange of knowledge. Independent publishers will be able to sell and show their latest publications. </p>

-------------------------------------------L’African Art Book Fair (AABF),  se tiendra au sein de la 12e biennale internationale d’art contemporain à Dakar. Cette manifestation repose sur une sélection d’éditeurs liés majoritairement à la production artistique du Sud, en dehors des réseaux commerciaux traditionnels. Il s’agit de publications d’artistes, de photographes, de graphistes, mais aussi de revues d’écoles d’art, de centres de recherches, de commissaires indépendants, qui se caractérisent par la vitalité des nouvelles pratiques éditoriales.

Qui sommes nous ?
Nous sommes un collectif d’artistes, de curateurs, d’adhérents et de sympathisants engagés dans à la promotion et la visibilité de l’art contemporain.

Description du projet
Nouvellement fondé, l’African Art Book Fair  soutien  la production critique dans les territoires du sud, sur la scène internationale.
L’African Art Book Fait convoque et questionne les différents formats d’écriture, de contenus esthétiques et de toute publication relative à l’art contemporain. Elle vise à collaborer avec les institutions internationales et les individus concernés par la production dans le domaine de l'art contemporain d’Afrique, le design, l'architecture, la conception et l'édition.




Numéros de la revue d’art AFRIKADAA déjà parus

Pourquoi c’est important ?
 Nous y serons  à la  12e biennale internationale d’art contemporain à Dakar, pour célébrer le sens,  l’écrit, le verbe, rassembler et construire l’histoire et consolider la mémoire de l’art contemporain du Sud.
Le commissaire de la biennale de Dakar, Simon Njami, par sa posture même d’écrivain, du thème et de ses choix éditoriaux affichés  lors de cette  biennale, souligne  une carence - certaine - de l’écrit au sein de cette biennale et ce depuis 24 années.
L’année 2016, correspond au 50e anniversaire du Festival mondial de  l’Art Nègre,  dont la première édition  s’est déroulé à Dakar, et fût organisé par l’État sénégalais dirigé par Léopold Sédar Senghor, quelques années après l’accès à l’indépendance de la plupart des pays africains, cet événement célébrait, pour la première fois en Afrique, la créativité et la diversité des arts et des pensées du continent et de ses diasporas. Le lien est flagrant pour s’en saisir !!

Le projet de l’African Art Book Fair, s’est imposé à nous comme une évidence  pour convoquer et questionner les différents formats d’écriture, de contenus esthétiques et de toute publication relative à l’art contemporain.
L’African Art Book Fair vise à collaborer avec les institutions internationales et les individus concernés par la production dans le domaine de l’art contemporain d’Afrique, le design, l’architecture et l’édition. Tisser les liens de  compréhension des enjeux  ici et maintenant pendant Dak’art rassemblant des pièces venues d’ici et là.

Impact
African Art Book Fair (AABF), présente les éditeurs d’art indépendants. C’est le premier salon du genre en Afrique. L’AABF comprend plus de 20 éditeurs internationaux, avec un accent particulier sur les publications et les approches expérimentales de l'édition, l'impression et l'écriture d'artistes.
La genèse de ce projet date de la biennale de Dakar de 2014, au regard à la fois de la carence de l’écrit et de la critique et du regain de la circulation des œuvres d’art contemporain Africain, dans le monde et sa présence dans les principales manifestations.

Pour réaliser ce projet un travail de prospection, consultation et conseil a été mené avec partage et passion et engagement pour l’amour de l’art…
1. Nous avons sélectionné des éditeurs
Le choix de la programmation repose sur une sélection de publications, d’éditeurs, d’artistes dont la pertinence de l’offre est en relation avec l'état actuel du monde, par ses composantes, technologique, esthétique, critique, géopolitique et environnementale. Toute une richesse !
Plusieurs éditeurs indépendants issus de l’Afrique et de l’Amérique du Sud ne peuvent pas venir car le coût des billets d’avion est trop élevé.
La solution de cette difficulté et de faire venir leur publications et de faire appel à des bénévoles engagés sur place, grâce à notre travail de lien sur le terrain

2. Nous avons établi une programmation
Des invités de choix, vont montrer, analyser, discuter de plusieurs productions différentes qui vont souligner la qualité de la production éditoriale en termes de forme et de contenu.

3. Nous avons invité des artistes, des curateurs, des médiateurs pour animer ces journées de foire
Le fait que ce milieu de l’édition soit sinistré, a rendu difficile le déplacement des éditeurs sur le plan financier, en dépit de l’intérêt pour la manifestation. D’ailleurs les les institutions n’ont pas répondu à notre requête d’être financé en partie.
Notre collectif est bénévole, les projets que nous menons, sont portés par notre passion de défendre l’art et la critique.

Aujourd’hui, nous sommes à quelques jours de la biennale, et plus que jamais, nous avons besoin de votre soutien !
1. Nous sollicitons des partenaires à différents niveaux de collaboration pour permettre à cette foire d’exister
2. Une fois la collecte honorée, nous partirons à Dakar pour mettre en place cette foire du livre en terme de dispositifs, de stands et de finaliser la communication
Cette foire d’art du livre permettra au publique et aux professionnels du monde de l art de découvrir les meilleurs publications qui se font sur le continent Africain.
Favoriser l’échange et les circulations des savoirs. Les éditeurs indépendants pourront échanger et faire découvrir leurs dernières publications.

D'autres façons d'aider

1. Nous sommes à recherche de bénévoles qui pourront assurer sur place une aide.

3.  Financièrement en adhérant à notre formule et vous serez remercié et récompensé
Cette foire d’ art du livre permettra au public et aux professionnels du monde de l’art de découvrir les meilleurs publications qui se font sur le continent africain.
Favoriser l’échange et les circulations des savoirs. Les éditeurs indépendants feront découvrir leurs dernières publications.
L’AABF, se positionne en tant qu’une entité itinérante qui s’invitera au sein des foires, salons, et biennales. La carence de la production critique menace aujourd’hui la transmission de l’art contemporain d’Afrique et ses diasporas, en termes de contenu critique, d’analyse. L’AABF traversera les frontières afin de confirmer la nécessité incontournable de s’inscrire dans l’écrit et le sens et de mémoriser des formes nouvelles et contemporaines.

AABF du 04 au 8 mai, pendant la 12e biennale de Dakar

The magazine Afrikadaa and its partners propose to unite all african and diasporic art publications to allow for the dissemination and exchange of experiences between the editorial productions through the sharing of knowledge and practice. 





African Art Book Fair (AABF)™ /1re édition
At the  Dakar Biennale
May 4th to 8th – 2016


African Art Book Fair (AABF) is an art publication fair with a discussion forum concentrating on themes linked to art publications, photography, design, experimental music, open culture and activism. By underlining the best practices of these domains, we aim to offer to the members of these communities a context in which they can maintain their integrity, their critical voice and their social role when faced with external factors (the market, urbanism, or media…). 
By recognizing and supporting unique and qualitative editorial practices African Art Book Fair wants to open up to a larger public, and put them in contact with the publishers, offline and online. The intersection between the different esthetic production fields is an integral part of the process. We want to put forward the editorial practices and the physicality of the book, as a medium and in its transcription towards other forms of media. 




The making of an art book fair during the Dakar Biennale! 
Given that the fields of editing and publication in art are under-represented, Afrikadaa and its partners are offering to unite all African and diaspora art publications in order to allow for various types of experiential exchange between the editorial productions. We wish to contribute to the development of an editorial pole of art by working on the creation of an African Art Book Fair (AABF), on the African continent. 
The idea to create an AABF that included all African contemporary Art organizations resulted from discussions at the symposium “Memory of the future,” organized by Afrikadaa during the last Dakar Biennale in 2014. Afrikadaa underlined the importance of defending the critical production and witnessing the evolution of an artistic period, especially in a context where we see that the desertion of writing will leave a huge hole in the construction of its history. Furthermore, Afrikadaa underlined the importance of relaying this information to future generations. The voluntary or unintentional eviction of books from biennales, art fairs, and other artistic events in Africa and the absence of magazines from the South in large international fairs, means there is an absence of critical content, esthetic debates about their times, and confrontations (sociological and ideological) of their work. This truly impoverishes the artistic world as a whole. Because of the drowning of the publication sector in Africa, we must encourage and uplift it through strong initiatives. We must encourage content worthy of critical acclaim, standard works, and artist books and unite to celebrate them during a fair dedicated to their existence. 
In partnership with the Dakar Biennale, the African Art Book Fair and Raw Material are glad to present the first edition of this international art book Fair from May 2nd to 8th 2016, during the Dak’art Biennale. 
African Art Book Fair  (AABF), offers a panel of large independent art editors from various countries in Africa, the Caribbean, the Americas and Europe. The AABF is the first exhibit of this type in Africa, and welcomes more than 30 international editors and spotlights publications offering experimental approaches to publishing, writing and the printing of works. 
The African Art Book Fair was founded very recently, and underlines the production and distribution of art publishing, a relatively new domain that has become an essential part of contemporary art in the last few years. It is imperative that these efforts are supported on the continent of Africa. The art edition includes images and text in the experimental form of artist books, art writing and magazines collectively edited, critical revues, and photography books. In this fertile field, the work of international artists is made available to the public through affordable editions, while offering an alternative to biennales, galleries, and museums. 
African Art Book Fair was founded by a group of artists and art critics who were worried about the production of critique in southern territories, and who were engaged in art publication in the international scene. 
The team : Hafida Jemni, Camille Moulonguet, Pascale Obolo and Jay Ramier, Lucy Topaloff, and Stephanie Bonnet (and support from its members). 
The African Art Book Fair questions the different ways of writing the esthetic contents of all contemporary art publications. It strives to collaborate with international institutions and individuals interested in the production of African contemporary art, design, architecture, conception, and publishing. 
The program was chosen by a select group of publications, editors, and artists who are in touch with the current state of the world, its technology, esthetic, critique, geopolitics and environment. This is a huge richness! 
This art book fair will allow the public and professionals in the art world to discover the best publications on the African continent. It will encourage exchange of knowledge. Independent publishers will be able to sell and show their latest publications.
