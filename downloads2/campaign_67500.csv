<h2>Campaign story </h2>
<p>Hello am Jasmine, I am a UK citizen however my background is Cameroonian . Cameroon has always been a quite country that many people don't know about because its not on the news as such. However over the past few years between 2016/ 2017 Cameroon started to have a divide. since its a French and English speaking country, the French wanted their independence however they where repress from their freedom of speech which has now escalated to something greater than just wanting independence.</p>
<p>Having this campaign is important because it raises awareness and its a call for help. Nobody should have to live in fear or scared to go out their house because they could get shot or their children could be kidnapped if they play out. People living in fear isn't living at all. With the help of wilder society we can stop this and bring happiness to peoples lives. Knowing that a crisis like this is happening back home is heart breaking. Everyone wants it to stop but no one knows how to go about helping which is why this campaign is going support them. Yes it wouldn't stop the war but it will remove the children from this nightmare their living in. I cant imagine the trauma that they live in, which is why am going to aim to make a difference in their lives.  </p>
<p>With every donation made that will bring us a step closer in saving a child's life and removing them from that surrounding especially the escaped kidnapped children who don't have a home to go back to or a family to take them back in. </p>
<p>The poverty rate is also increasing in Cameroon due to the war because of lack of jobs due to what they call ""GOST TOWN"" which is a period where everyone most stay at home just like house arrest. This can last about a week or more. During this period people who don't have enough food supplies are at risk of starving to death or going to the farm and getting shot. With the funding vulnerable people like this will receive bags of food supplies so they are not at risk in losing their lives.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Goal- £3000</h3>
<p>To achieve this goal we are aiming to raise a £3000 funding and this will go towards moving the kidnapped children to a safer nearby country so they away from this trauma.  </p>
<p>As a perks am selling wristbands to raise more funds. I am also going to be hosting a fundraising event to help raise more awareness and support funding. If am unable to reach this goal, with the funds I do have, I will use it to help provide food for the children.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> In life I have learnt that there's challenges everywhere and Cameroon is currently facing a historical challenge one that will change the country for ever. This campaign is risky in it self raising money to move vulnerable children to a safer country. The big question is where is the safer country and the truth is I don't know but what I do know is Cameroon is not safe at this current moment and its not a place for children and elderly.</p>

I observed and photographed many different Moon-stars-planets conjunctions, artificial satellites, atmospheric phenomena and other.</p><p>I am discoverer (without anyone's help, by self-education) of 54 variable stars and I wrote the scientific paper ""Possible dwarf nova on the Digitized Sky Survey plates"" about my discovery and my research of one of these stars, it was published  <a href=""http://var.astro.cz/oejv/oejv.php?oejv=190"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://var.astro.cz/oejv/oejv.php?oejv=190</a> (on September 05, 2019) in the Open European Journal on Variable Stars (this paper has already been submitted in the NASA Astrophysics Data System: <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018OEJV..190....1R"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018OEJV..190....1R</a>  ).

In my childhood, after my birth, in the maternity hospital and in the children's hospital, I got sick: sepsis and hematogenous osteomyelitis, after which I acquired diseases: coxarthrosis of both hip joints, bronchial asthma, thrombocytopathy. I was disabled for almost 10 years in orthopedics. I spent my childhood in hospitals. Teachers from school came to my home for teaching me school subjects (lessons). I have a heart defect. After 9 years of school education, I studied for 4 years in the college and graduated from college in Moscow with a degree in radio engineering and got a diploma (with excellent marks in all educational disciplines) of college (by analogy level of education with Vocational School).</p><p>I had a dream to enter the Lomonosov Moscow State University to study astronomy and become an astronomer, so I came to Moscow from Primorsky Krai of the Russian Far East. My relatives together all bought me a small room (its area of 13.2 square meters) in a two-room communal apartment in Moscow. The room had a price: 2 900 000 Russian rubles (on the day of purchase of the room its price was in USD = almost $ 41000, and today it is over $ 44000 - at the rate of Central Bank of the Russian Federation).</p><p>I wanted to prepare there for the entrance exams to the University and I wanted live there while studying at the University. But on January 23, 2017 I lost the opportunity to live in my room, because a lot of citizens - are guests (together with a policeman of Moscow - employee of the Moscow police) of the new owner of the next room - together they illegally violated our rights - by the type of apartment raiding (Rus. квартирное рейдерство), so: me, my mother and our old cat - we left my room - we went to the street - , and these citizens have created obstacles to the sale of my room. My room is for sale since March 2017  <a href=""https://www.avito.ru/moskva/komnaty/komnata_13.2_m_v_2-k_1214_et._1062043827"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.avito.ru/moskva/komnaty/komnata_13.2_m_v_2-k_1214_et._1062043827</a> , but these aggressive residents from another room in that communal apartment are create obstacles in its sale (and the daughter of new owner of the next room - in this communal apartment - said that the buyers of my room will not look at places of common use and that she forbids it). These new residents of a different room created obstacles for me and my mother: we can not to live in this apartment because of them, because they intentionally created unbearable living conditions for us. Their behavior and actions: aggressive, cruel, lawless, and all these facts are recorded on video, but the police and officials did not help us.</p><p>One of the guests of the new owner of the next room in this communal apartment - an adult man - attacked my mother - he hit her; another guest of the new owner of the next room - policeman of Moscow police - he was trying to enter our (my and my mom) room; the adult daughter of the new owner of the next room — she was intentionally sprayed an aerosol balloon with a household chemical substance with a pungent smell near my face for a long time, and she intentionally poured the door of our room with a liquid with strong smell which started my asthma attack; the new owner of the next room specially poured a lot of vinegar and chlorine liquid everywhere in this communal apartment and intentionally poured liquid household chemicals with a suffocating (pungent) smell under the door of our room and this adult woman committed theft of property in this communal apartment.</p><p>All these citizens regularly obscenely insulted (with indecent words) me and my mother, for no reason at all. My mother and I did not make a conflict, my mother and I just wanted to live peacefully in our room, but these people threatened us (including ""will do the Bartholomew's night""), they did not let us into the kitchen and did not let us enter the communal apartment (flat) and we were banned from using the bathroom.</p><p>We were deprived of the opportunity to live safely and unhindered in this communal apartment, we lost the opportunity to take away our belongings and my telescopes from my room, and I lost the opportunity to sell my room. As a result, since January 23, 2017, I, my mother and our old cat Fanya (she is now 13 years old, she was born on August 10, 2005) - we are homeless and we really need your help in buying us another housing.</p><p>My life and my mother's life were in danger in this communal apartment, so we fleeing we went wandering. For two years, my mother and I have been writing statements, with video evidence of illegally violations of our rights, to the police, but there is no result; I wrote to mayor of Moscow - Sergey Sobyanin and to President of Russia - Vladimir Putin, but probably, the officials did not give them my letters (my letters to the President of Russia and to the Mayor of Moscow were redirected by officials to other institutions of Moscow); no one helped me and we are forced to wander as homeless, so about it I created my petition on December 09, 2017 on change.org: <a href=""https://www.change.org/p/%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5-%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BD%D1%83%D1%82%D1%8C-%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%8C%D0%B3%D0%B8-%D1%81%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8-%D0%B2-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BC%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B9-%D0%BA%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B5-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BF%D1%8F%D1%82%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D1%83%D1%8E%D1%82-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%B6%D0%B5-%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%B9-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8B"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.change.org/p/%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5-%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BD%D1%83%D1%82%D1%8C-%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%8C%D0%B3%D0%B8-%D1%81%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8-%D0%B2-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BC%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B9-%D0%BA%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B5-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BF%D1%8F%D1%82%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D1%83%D1%8E%D1%82-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%B6%D0%B5-%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%B9-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8B</a> .</p><p>All our things and my telescopes stayed in my room in Moscow, and now I returned to Primorsky Krai (in Yuzhno-Morskoy, near Nakhodka and at a distance of three kilometers from Srednyaya Bay, which received a sad worldwide fame in the mass media in connection with the nickname ""whale jail""), where people named me ""Galileo of Primorsky Krai"" and where my old grandparents live. But here there is no study for an astronomer, and our little family has no money to buy me again housing and a telescopes (telescope for observations of the starry sky and solar telescope). I want to study astronomy, but I don't have the opportunity. Because of wandering I didn't have a place to write my scientific paper, because my mother and I even spent the night at the station in Moscow, and I wrote my manuscript on sheets of paper, so only after 1.5 years (!) after my discovery of the variable star Romanov V1, I was able to send via the Internet - to a scientific journal - my manuscript through my broken (like my smartphone crashed on the street) in wanderings computer.</p><p>From Lomonosov Moscow State University, I received a letter that for the results of observations in astronomy, they do not accept students for education without passing entrance examinations. But I have no housing to study for exams, because I am homeless. And I have not only observations, but also scientific discoveries.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/gBQYlMQ9XHE?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p>From Saint Petersburg State University I also received a letter that they will not take me to study without passing entrance exams.</p><p>The article about this my worst life situation was published  <a href=""http://primorye24.ru/news/post/88728-moskvichi-koshmaryat-znamenitogo-astronoma-iz-primorya"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://primorye24.ru/news/post/88728-moskvichi-koshmaryat-znamenitogo-astronoma-iz-primorya</a>  on December 15, 2017 in the mass media, but no one helped me.</p><p>My mother Larisa Romanova (was born on October 09, 1975), a nurse, cannot earn a lot of money; I have no father. My grandmother has cancer (oncology) and she was operated, and my grandfather is an old pensioner and he was operated too. They can not help me by money.</p><p>For two years of my wandering and of my mom, we spent money (about one million rubles, which is now over 15000 dollars): on renting someone else’s housing, on paying for trips (our relocations) to different regions of Russia, on buying only the most necessary: food and medical means, clothes and shoes (because our - total price about one million rubles - things: clothes, shoes, my telescopes - stayed in my room in Moscow). Therefore, so that I can buy the housing again for the amount of money: that I had in Russian rubles, and how much we spent during our wanderings, and how much my mother and I suffered a monetary loss in our things in the room, and we need to pay the debt for housing services (Rus. ЖКУ) for the room where my mom and I can not live for more than two years, but for its utility bills are accrued every month; so to buy housing, furniture and things, and telescopes again, I denote the amount I need in 80000 dollars (considering the rule of reserved funds and commission fees of this campaign and bank charges).</p><p>On March 14, 2019, I received information to my e-mail address that court judgment was made on August 2018 (which I was not informed of earlier) and that against me since March 11, 2019 the enforcement proceedings were begun to recover (more than 22000 rubles) my debt for utilities (from over 36000 rubles, accrued in debt during my wanderings, although in wanderings I still paid for utilities in this communal apartment until August 2017, although I did not have the opportunity to live there safely since January 23, 2017). I am deprived of opportunity to live safely and without obstacles in my room, but I also need to pay money for those housing services that I did not consume (for example, for hot and cold water, for central heating in radiators and other services). Maybe soon my bank account (there is no money on it - it was opened when I was in college and received a small scholarship there) will be blocked if this debt is not paid by me. I consider this monetary debt is unfair, but it will accumulate and continue, although I am homeless, and this debt will still have to be paid (although I often do not have money for bread), so this fact discarded my last doubts about the possibility of creating this campaign and strengthened my intention to ask help from kind people from all over the world.</p><p>Many people (for example, on Reddit:  <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/arkwx0/my_discovery_of_possible_dwarf_nova_on_the/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/arkwx0/my_discovery_of_possible_dwarf_nova_on_the/</a> ) who have read about my scientific discoveries have called me talented. After reading about my wanderings, they gave me advice to create crowdfunding to raise money for me to buy a flat. I had been thinking about this advice for 2 months, because I was hoping that the officials in Russia, to whom I sent a lot of my statements about my forced wanderings, would help me solve my housing trouble (misfortune). Nobody helped me in my country, so I (homeless amateur astronomer) created on March 21, 2019 - on the day of the Spring Equinox (by local time in Primorsky Krai) - this campaign to raise money to buy a flat for me, my mom and our old cat Fanya. I didn’t plan to write/tell the whole world that I’m not protected in Russia (and I did not tell about my trouble to workers of foreign mass media, for example, even during the FIFA World Cup in the summer of 2018, because I hoped for help from officials in Russia), but my statements to the officials in Russia and my petition did not bring any results, but it’s bad for me to wander (and I am tired), because I have a lot of diseases (of joints, of bronchi, of blood and of heart).</p><p>We do not have money for a lawyer/attorney; so I do not have the opportunity to go to court, but I can not continue to be homeless with my many diseases. I really need your help. I thank everyone for every possible help (your free charitable gift/donation) to me and my mom for buying a housing. Then my mother and I can: it is safe to live in a new home, and I can: and prepare for university to study astronomy, continue to astronomical observations through telescopes (if I will have them in new housing), make new astronomical discoveries and contribute to the science worldwide - for people from all countries of the planet Earth.</p></div>","Hello.

Since then I have seen and photographed many astronomical phenomena: 5 lunar eclipses, 3 solar eclipses (for example, my last observation and live stream:  http://www.astrosurf.com/topic/123838-eclipse-partielle-du-6-janvier-en-live/   ); occultations of planets (of Venus, of Neptune) and of many stars (including Aldebaran) by the Moon; occultation of the star by asteroid (159) Aemilia: http://www.euraster.net/results/2016/index.html#0901-159  ; occultation of star by Jupiter. I saw (some of them I only photographed) 19 comets (list of my visual observations:  http://195.209.248.207/en/usersDetail/observations/176   ), 9 near-Earth asteroids (including 2012 DA14), and variable stars:  https://aavso.org/apps/webobs/results/?obscode=RFDA&num_results=100&obs_types=all  . I photographed the microlensing event Gaia16aye, outburst of black hole X-ray binary V0404 Cygni and of blazar 4C 11.69. I observed Perseids and Geminids, aurorae on March 17, 2015 (in Moscow Oblast) and on October 31, 2018 (from airplane). I observed different sunspots several hundred times over the years, including the transit of Venus on June 06, 2012  https://solarchatforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=23903  and transit of Mercury in 2016. I observed and photographed many different Moon-stars-planets conjunctions, artificial satellites, atmospheric phenomena and other.I am discoverer (without anyone's help, by self-education) of 54 variable stars and I wrote the scientific paper ""Possible dwarf nova on the Digitized Sky Survey plates"" about my discovery and my research of one of these stars, it was published  http://var.astro.cz/oejv/oejv.php?oejv=190 (on September 05, 2019) in the Open European Journal on Variable Stars (this paper has already been submitted in the NASA Astrophysics Data System: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018OEJV..190....1R  ). Also, I discovered (information about this is in the magazine L'Astronomie, March 2019, on the pages 54-55) of 10 planetary nebulae candidates and 1 astronomical object of uncertain nature: on February 2019, these astronomical objects were added in the HASH PN database and on March 2019 part of these objects were published in the VizieR catalogue, for example:  http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR-5?-ref=VIZ5c7f88989356&-out.add=.&-source=J/other/LAstr/125.54/table1&recno=308  . I was also able to correctly identify the position of a variable star V3941 Sgr:  https://www.aavso.org/vsx/index.php?view=detail.top&oid=31641   List of my astronomical discoveries:  https://filipp-romanov.livejournal.com/27664.htmlMy mother brought me up herself (alone). In my childhood, after my birth, in the maternity hospital and in the children's hospital, I got sick: sepsis and hematogenous osteomyelitis, after which I acquired diseases: coxarthrosis of both hip joints, bronchial asthma, thrombocytopathy. I was disabled for almost 10 years in orthopedics. I spent my childhood in hospitals. Teachers from school came to my home for teaching me school subjects (lessons). I have a heart defect. After 9 years of school education, I studied for 4 years in the college and graduated from college in Moscow with a degree in radio engineering and got a diploma (with excellent marks in all educational disciplines) of college (by analogy level of education with Vocational School).I had a dream to enter the Lomonosov Moscow State University to study astronomy and become an astronomer, so I came to Moscow from Primorsky Krai of the Russian Far East. My relatives together all bought me a small room (its area of 13.2 square meters) in a two-room communal apartment in Moscow. The room had a price: 2 900 000 Russian rubles (on the day of purchase of the room its price was in USD = almost $ 41000, and today it is over $ 44000 - at the rate of Central Bank of the Russian Federation).I wanted to prepare there for the entrance exams to the University and I wanted live there while studying at the University. But on January 23, 2017 I lost the opportunity to live in my room, because a lot of citizens - are guests (together with a policeman of Moscow - employee of the Moscow police) of the new owner of the next room - together they illegally violated our rights - by the type of apartment raiding (Rus. квартирное рейдерство), so: me, my mother and our old cat - we left my room - we went to the street - , and these citizens have created obstacles to the sale of my room. My room is for sale since March 2017  https://www.avito.ru/moskva/komnaty/komnata_13.2_m_v_2-k_1214_et._1062043827 , but these aggressive residents from another room in that communal apartment are create obstacles in its sale (and the daughter of new owner of the next room - in this communal apartment - said that the buyers of my room will not look at places of common use and that she forbids it). These new residents of a different room created obstacles for me and my mother: we can not to live in this apartment because of them, because they intentionally created unbearable living conditions for us. Their behavior and actions: aggressive, cruel, lawless, and all these facts are recorded on video, but the police and officials did not help us.One of the guests of the new owner of the next room in this communal apartment - an adult man - attacked my mother - he hit her; another guest of the new owner of the next room - policeman of Moscow police - he was trying to enter our (my and my mom) room; the adult daughter of the new owner of the next room — she was intentionally sprayed an aerosol balloon with a household chemical substance with a pungent smell near my face for a long time, and she intentionally poured the door of our room with a liquid with strong smell which started my asthma attack; the new owner of the next room specially poured a lot of vinegar and chlorine liquid everywhere in this communal apartment and intentionally poured liquid household chemicals with a suffocating (pungent) smell under the door of our room and this adult woman committed theft of property in this communal apartment.All these citizens regularly obscenely insulted (with indecent words) me and my mother, for no reason at all. My mother and I did not make a conflict, my mother and I just wanted to live peacefully in our room, but these people threatened us (including ""will do the Bartholomew's night""), they did not let us into the kitchen and did not let us enter the communal apartment (flat) and we were banned from using the bathroom.We were deprived of the opportunity to live safely and unhindered in this communal apartment, we lost the opportunity to take away our belongings and my telescopes from my room, and I lost the opportunity to sell my room. As a result, since January 23, 2017, I, my mother and our old cat Fanya (she is now 13 years old, she was born on August 10, 2005) - we are homeless and we really need your help in buying us another housing.My life and my mother's life were in danger in this communal apartment, so we fleeing we went wandering. For two years, my mother and I have been writing statements, with video evidence of illegally violations of our rights, to the police, but there is no result; I wrote to mayor of Moscow - Sergey Sobyanin and to President of Russia - Vladimir Putin, but probably, the officials did not give them my letters (my letters to the President of Russia and to the Mayor of Moscow were redirected by officials to other institutions of Moscow); no one helped me and we are forced to wander as homeless, so about it I created my petition on December 09, 2017 on change.org: https://www.change.org/p/%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5-%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BD%D1%83%D1%82%D1%8C-%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%8C%D0%B3%D0%B8-%D1%81%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8-%D0%B2-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BC%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B9-%D0%BA%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B5-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BF%D1%8F%D1%82%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D1%83%D1%8E%D1%82-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%B6%D0%B5-%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%B9-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8B .All our things and my telescopes stayed in my room in Moscow, and now I returned to Primorsky Krai (in Yuzhno-Morskoy, near Nakhodka and at a distance of three kilometers from Srednyaya Bay, which received a sad worldwide fame in the mass media in connection with the nickname ""whale jail""), where people named me ""Galileo of Primorsky Krai"" and where my old grandparents live. But here there is no study for an astronomer, and our little family has no money to buy me again housing and a telescopes (telescope for observations of the starry sky and solar telescope). I want to study astronomy, but I don't have the opportunity. Because of wandering I didn't have a place to write my scientific paper, because my mother and I even spent the night at the station in Moscow, and I wrote my manuscript on sheets of paper, so only after 1.5 years (!) after my discovery of the variable star Romanov V1, I was able to send via the Internet - to a scientific journal - my manuscript through my broken (like my smartphone crashed on the street) in wanderings computer.From Lomonosov Moscow State University, I received a letter that for the results of observations in astronomy, they do not accept students for education without passing entrance examinations. But I have no housing to study for exams, because I am homeless. And I have not only observations, but also scientific discoveries.From Saint Petersburg State University I also received a letter that they will not take me to study without passing entrance exams.The article about this my worst life situation was published  http://primorye24.ru/news/post/88728-moskvichi-koshmaryat-znamenitogo-astronoma-iz-primorya  on December 15, 2017 in the mass media, but no one helped me.My mother Larisa Romanova (was born on October 09, 1975), a nurse, cannot earn a lot of money; I have no father. My grandmother has cancer (oncology) and she was operated, and my grandfather is an old pensioner and he was operated too. They can not help me by money.For two years of my wandering and of my mom, we spent money (about one million rubles, which is now over 15000 dollars): on renting someone else’s housing, on paying for trips (our relocations) to different regions of Russia, on buying only the most necessary: food and medical means, clothes and shoes (because our - total price about one million rubles - things: clothes, shoes, my telescopes - stayed in my room in Moscow). Therefore, so that I can buy the housing again for the amount of money: that I had in Russian rubles, and how much we spent during our wanderings, and how much my mother and I suffered a monetary loss in our things in the room, and we need to pay the debt for housing services (Rus. ЖКУ) for the room where my mom and I can not live for more than two years, but for its utility bills are accrued every month; so to buy housing, furniture and things, and telescopes again, I denote the amount I need in 80000 dollars (considering the rule of reserved funds and commission fees of this campaign and bank charges).On March 14, 2019, I received information to my e-mail address that court judgment was made on August 2018 (which I was not informed of earlier) and that against me since March 11, 2019 the enforcement proceedings were begun to recover (more than 22000 rubles) my debt for utilities (from over 36000 rubles, accrued in debt during my wanderings, although in wanderings I still paid for utilities in this communal apartment until August 2017, although I did not have the opportunity to live there safely since January 23, 2017). I am deprived of opportunity to live safely and without obstacles in my room, but I also need to pay money for those housing services that I did not consume (for example, for hot and cold water, for central heating in radiators and other services). Maybe soon my bank account (there is no money on it - it was opened when I was in college and received a small scholarship there) will be blocked if this debt is not paid by me. I consider this monetary debt is unfair, but it will accumulate and continue, although I am homeless, and this debt will still have to be paid (although I often do not have money for bread), so this fact discarded my last doubts about the possibility of creating this campaign and strengthened my intention to ask help from kind people from all over the world.Many people (for example, on Reddit:  https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/arkwx0/my_discovery_of_possible_dwarf_nova_on_the/ ) who have read about my scientific discoveries have called me talented. After reading about my wanderings, they gave me advice to create crowdfunding to raise money for me to buy a flat. I had been thinking about this advice for 2 months, because I was hoping that the officials in Russia, to whom I sent a lot of my statements about my forced wanderings, would help me solve my housing trouble (misfortune). Nobody helped me in my country, so I (homeless amateur astronomer) created on March 21, 2019 - on the day of the Spring Equinox (by local time in Primorsky Krai) - this campaign to raise money to buy a flat for me, my mom and our old cat Fanya. I didn’t plan to write/tell the whole world that I’m not protected in Russia (and I did not tell about my trouble to workers of foreign mass media, for example, even during the FIFA World Cup in the summer of 2018, because I hoped for help from officials in Russia), but my statements to the officials in Russia and my petition did not bring any results, but it’s bad for me to wander (and I am tired), because I have a lot of diseases (of joints, of bronchi, of blood and of heart).We do not have money for a lawyer/attorney; so I do not have the opportunity to go to court, but I can not continue to be homeless with my many diseases. I really need your help. I thank everyone for every possible help (your free charitable gift/donation) to me and my mom for buying a housing. Then my mother and I can: it is safe to live in a new home, and I can: and prepare for university to study astronomy, continue to astronomical observations through telescopes (if I will have them in new housing), make new astronomical discoveries and contribute to the science worldwide - for people from all countries of the planet Earth.",0.0,1,"1 Campaign

We appreciate the belief, effort and standing by us - through the growth. This marks as our final fundraiser in 3 years!</strong></p><p>We just completed our fundraiser 2 weeks ago and we raised $455/3000. We are relaunching to raise the $2550 to help us move forward. We are also launching the Hub in Kenya, East Africa and since we have heads all over Africa, this is a 1st of many. The launch has gone through many hurdles to get here. We have had to look for a venue for over a month, finally, we got one that is okay with feminists and LGBT activists to exist and be free!<br/><u>What did we need?</u><br/>1. A camera - for weekly web series and interviews; a story after another gives change leeway.<br/>2. A podcast Studio - an online radio to bring African stories to the world &amp; have activists and survivors tell their stories.<br/>3. Laptops - We have one that has been functional 4 years and it is on its last days.<br/>4. (We have paid for hosting and themes).</p><p>5. The ability to give our writers an honorarium.</p><p><u><strong>What is IDEA, WHAT DOES IT DO AND HOW FAR CAN IDEA GO INTO CHANGING THE LIVES OF WOMEN AND THE LGBT COMMUNITY?</strong></u></p><p>IDEA (afroidea.com) was founded to raise awareness within African Communities on the need to support the rights of young feminists and the LGBTQ community especially trans, bi women and lesbians. We started with Kenya, we are now in East, West and Southern, North and Central Africa! We decided at the end of 2018 to:</p><ol>
<li>Have writers and activists all over Africa hence we opened up calls for submissions to be continental!</li>
<li>Have department heads on a regional level and on certain much-needed topics and we have gotten heads for 3 regions (East, West, Southern) and different column editors for similar topics in different regions!</li>
<li>To have a sustainable model that would create employment, help us build the physical Hub we have been aiming for and support other African led initiatives. (our financial projection aims at catering for the needs mentioned)</li>
</ol><p>The launch will be on June 8th. If you wish to give to our event preparation, we would be thrilled! You can choose to pay for a Kenyan feminist and LGBT activist to attend and we will call for submissions!</p><p><strong><a href=""https://afroidea.com/staff-page/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MEET SOME OF OUR VOLUNTEER STAFF!</a> and have a look at the Maverick women and men that have helped IDEA grow for the past 3 years!</strong></p><p><u><strong>We are asking for help raising $2550 (and we hope to raise most of it through the launch) for the following:</strong></u></p><ol>
<li>Buying a camera and sound (for our interviews with women and members of the LGBTQ community) on social, economic and political matters that influence diversity, equality, and Inclusion. $580 for a camera and $100 for sound. When we started out, we would borrow cameras to attend and support events and when we couldn't anymore the program died out. We need to start a fierce web series that creates a platform to have discussions such a more inclusive and informed version of this one.</li>
<li>We need a piece of podcast equipment for daily podcast shows centered around campaigning for Equality, Inclusion, and Diversity. The podcast studio we have spotted will cost us $530 and the package entails: </li>
</ol><p>                 - A professional podcasting, music production, and digital home recording equipment</p><p>                 - Full recording  ""out of the box"" studio including FireWire interface, mixer, microphone, headphones, professional music software and more</p><p>                 - Professional 8-input 2-bus mixer with premium mic preamps and 3-band EQs</p><p>                 - Table microphone stand, microphone windscreen and cable, four 1/4"" jack cables and two FireWire cables</p><p>                 - Powerful DAW software </p><p>3. Buy a laptop that will be used for video editing, editing content sent to us and also use it for operations. $500</p><p>- Website maintenance: $100 (we have a web designer that has cut off over 90% of the fee charged to maintain the site year round.)</p><p><u><strong>WE HAVE ALREADY:</strong></u></p><p>- Paid annual Hosting costs - $220 with a 63% off discount annually.

Kenya, like most African nations, tends to culturally and socially exclude women and members of the LGBTQ community in the participation of community policies and activities. </p><p>IDEA AFRICA emphasizes on the need for African activism on three fronts: issues activism takes on with a focus on women and the LGBTQ community, the African communities approaching those issues and the ways they choose to tackle them factoring in the deeply embedded oppressive cultural norms that instigate injustices and oppression.</p><p>Women are seen as an inferior gender and their voices silenced whereas, members of the LGBTQ community especially trans (with examples of people coming out and being shunned evident)- they are seen to defy and insult the African culture. Sexual rights and identities are a mere concept in most nations in Africa. Women have a huge gap to fill. Our goal as IDEA is to make sure that there is a voice, and a stern loud one when it comes to respecting and enforcing the rights of women and the LGBTQ community through online advocacy and partnerships. </p><p>This can only be done by normalizing what is seen as a divorce of the culture and pinpointing the shareholders of change.  A lot of oppression on women and members of the LGBTQ community is instigated by norms that are derived from moral high grounds crafted either by culture or politics for the benefit of the majority beneficiaries. </p><p>To push for more resource centers, policies, initiatives we need to have a bigger voice. We need to have more people join us. To create the impact we need allies, we need support.

We appreciate the belief, effort and standing by us - through the growth. This marks as our final fundraiser in 3 years!We just completed our fundraiser 2 weeks ago and we raised $455/3000. We are relaunching to raise the $2550 to help us move forward. We are also launching the Hub in Kenya, East Africa and since we have heads all over Africa, this is a 1st of many. The launch has gone through many hurdles to get here. We have had to look for a venue for over a month, finally, we got one that is okay with feminists and LGBT activists to exist and be free!What did we need?1. A camera - for weekly web series and interviews; a story after another gives change leeway.2. A podcast Studio - an online radio to bring African stories to the world & have activists and survivors tell their stories.3. Laptops - We have one that has been functional 4 years and it is on its last days.4. (We have paid for hosting and themes).5. The ability to give our writers an honorarium.What is IDEA, WHAT DOES IT DO AND HOW FAR CAN IDEA GO INTO CHANGING THE LIVES OF WOMEN AND THE LGBT COMMUNITY?IDEA (afroidea.com) was founded to raise awareness within African Communities on the need to support the rights of young feminists and the LGBTQ community especially trans, bi women and lesbians. We started with Kenya, we are now in East, West and Southern, North and Central Africa! We decided at the end of 2018 to:
Have writers and activists all over Africa hence we opened up calls for submissions to be continental!
Have department heads on a regional level and on certain much-needed topics and we have gotten heads for 3 regions (East, West, Southern) and different column editors for similar topics in different regions!
To have a sustainable model that would create employment, help us build the physical Hub we have been aiming for and support other African led initiatives. (our financial projection aims at catering for the needs mentioned)
The launch will be on June 8th. If you wish to give to our event preparation, we would be thrilled! You can choose to pay for a Kenyan feminist and LGBT activist to attend and we will call for submissions!MEET SOME OF OUR VOLUNTEER STAFF! and have a look at the Maverick women and men that have helped IDEA grow for the past 3 years!We are asking for help raising $2550 (and we hope to raise most of it through the launch) for the following:
Buying a camera and sound (for our interviews with women and members of the LGBTQ community) on social, economic and political matters that influence diversity, equality, and Inclusion. $580 for a camera and $100 for sound. When we started out, we would borrow cameras to attend and support events and when we couldn't anymore the program died out. We need to start a fierce web series that creates a platform to have discussions such a more inclusive and informed version of this one.
We need a piece of podcast equipment for daily podcast shows centered around campaigning for Equality, Inclusion, and Diversity. The podcast studio we have spotted will cost us $530 and the package entails: 
                 - A professional podcasting, music production, and digital home recording equipment                 - Full recording  ""out of the box"" studio including FireWire interface, mixer, microphone, headphones, professional music software and more                 - Professional 8-input 2-bus mixer with premium mic preamps and 3-band EQs                 - Table microphone stand, microphone windscreen and cable, four 1/4"" jack cables and two FireWire cables                 - Powerful DAW software 3. Buy a laptop that will be used for video editing, editing content sent to us and also use it for operations. $500- Website maintenance: $100 (we have a web designer that has cut off over 90% of the fee charged to maintain the site year round.)WE HAVE ALREADY:- Paid annual Hosting costs - $220 with a 63% off discount annually. Without the discount, the cost would be $563 (the package is 36 months all paid hosting at Bluehost and estimates roughly the same with most hosting companies)- Bought custom Themes $168THIS WAS OUR 2019 BUDGETIDEA OVERVIEWIDEA has been using the creative and online space to advocate for diversity, inclusion, and Equality for young women and members of the LGBTQ community. Kenya, like most African nations, tends to culturally and socially exclude women and members of the LGBTQ community in the participation of community policies and activities. IDEA AFRICA emphasizes on the need for African activism on three fronts: issues activism takes on with a focus on women and the LGBTQ community, the African communities approaching those issues and the ways they choose to tackle them factoring in the deeply embedded oppressive cultural norms that instigate injustices and oppression.Women are seen as an inferior gender and their voices silenced whereas, members of the LGBTQ community especially trans (with examples of people coming out and being shunned evident)- they are seen to defy and insult the African culture. Sexual rights and identities are a mere concept in most nations in Africa. Women have a huge gap to fill. Our goal as IDEA is to make sure that there is a voice, and a stern loud one when it comes to respecting and enforcing the rights of women and the LGBTQ community through online advocacy and partnerships. This can only be done by normalizing what is seen as a divorce of the culture and pinpointing the shareholders of change.  A lot of oppression on women and members of the LGBTQ community is instigated by norms that are derived from moral high grounds crafted either by culture or politics for the benefit of the majority beneficiaries. To push for more resource centers, policies, initiatives we need to have a bigger voice. We need to have more people join us. To create the impact we need allies, we need support. To be different, impactful and ready to be change makers we need you!Kenyans, have a huge online presence and a love for the creative space, hence provides us with the platform to create awareness and acceptance.

<p>Somos Wendy y Wylkyns Racines, orgullosos hijos de Javier Racines, de 63 años, músico, sastre y un hombre de bien actualmente comprometido de salud y hospitalizado en la UCI de una Clínica Privada en Caracas, Venezuela, por infección bacteriana y fibrosis pulmonar, tras tormenta de citocinas en el Día 13 de tratamiento.</p>
<p><strong>Fue rechazado en todos los hospitales públicos porque están ABARROTADOS de pacientes en UCI </strong>y también de varias clínicas por tener más de 60 años y ser paciente COVID-19, solo pudieron recibirlo en la clínica actual. 23560 USD por 10 días (factura a c<a href=""https://wa.link/rt39x5"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://wa.link/rt39x5</a>ontinuación) que le ha salvado la vida y ahora necesitamos 46.600 USD para garantizar 10 días adicionales en cuidado intensivo.</p>
<p><u>NOTA: 95.139.665.365,48 Bs. equivalían al cambio en 24.000 USD el 19/09</u></p>

<p><strong>Venezuela vive una Emergencia Humanitaria Compleja con un alto costo de la vida, hiperinflación, y costos en el sistema de salud. </strong>Los hospitales tienen una atención muy precaria y están abarrotados por alza de contagios. El acceso a seguros de calidad para Adultos Mayores es limitado y de costo elevado. </p>
<p>Por ejemplo:</p>
<ul>
<li>6 ampollas de Remdisivir que utilizó en 4 días tienen un costo en Venezuela que oscila los 240-480 USD.</li>
<li>El costo de alquiler del concentrador de oxígeno en casa por 7 días oscila entre los 180-300 USD.</li>
<li>1 hora de ambulancia con bomba de oxígeno son entre 200-350 USD según las distancias.</li>
<li>Las clínicas privadas ofrecen ingresos a UCI en un rango de 12.000 a 30.000 USD de contado. El salario mínimo en Venezuela es de 7.000.000 Bs. (actualmente 3 USD).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>En Venezuela los adultos mayores están desamparados,</strong> no hay ley que los proteja, no hay garantías en el sistema de salud, ni vacunas oportunamente. Los servicios fallan constantemente: en casa no hay agua ni Internet, la luz puede tener intermitencias en momentos inesperados. </p>
<h3><strong>Pero necesitamos más redes de ayuda para sostener todos los costos y darle más días de UCI y hospital a mi padre para salvar su vida.</strong></h3>

<li>29/06 Nuestro papá fue vacunado con la primera dosis de la vacuna rusa Sputnik. Ha esperado semanas por la segunda dosis - sin éxito.</li>
<li>02/09 Tuvo sus primeros síntomas de COVID-19. Permanente ansiedad y miedo.</li>
<li>05/09 Presenta síntomas agudos, se le asigna monitoreo y un tratamiento.</li>
<li>11/09 Crisis respiratoria. Presenta neumonía moderada a grave y se le asigna hospitalización en casa, dependiendo de un concentrador de oxígeno.</li>
<li>12/09 Primeras placas de sus pulmones.</li>
<li>15/09 Muestra síntomas de mejora, inicia ejercicios de respiración y en ocasiones se retira la mascarilla del concentrador de oxígeno el mismo.</li>
<li>18/09 Crisis respiratoria y de ansiedad. Potencial Tormenta de citocinas. Segundas placas de sus pulmones (adjunta a continuación). Ordenan hospitalización formal. 24 horas de calvario. Pico más bajo de oxigenación en la sangre: 33.</li>
<li>19/09 Se logra hospitalización para salvar su vida en la clínica privada Centro Médico Loira de El Paraíso desde las 5:00 AM. con 5 días de ingreso a UCI y 5 días más de rehabilitación por un costo de 950 USD + 24.000 USD pago de contado.</li>
<li>20/09 Se diagnostica en UCI una fibrosis pulmonar. Al momento de entrar, volvió a tener picos de 55 y 33 en oxigenación. Lo más probable es que se deba extender los días en UCI y hospitalización hasta 10 días más.</li>
<li>22/09 Primeras síntomas leves de mejoraría. Se detiene la inflamación. Bajan los valores de proteína en la sangre. Se mantiene entubado y sedado en su 3er día de UCI.</li>

<h2><strong><i>------</i>ENGLISH VERSION-------</strong></h2>
<p>We are Wendy and Wylkyns Racines, proud children of Javier Racines, who is 63 years old. Our father is a musician, tailor, and a good man who is currently at the Intensive Care Unit of a private hospital in Caracas, Venezuela, due to an infection in one of his lungs, after a cytokine storm he faced on the 13th day of his COVID treatment.</p>
<p><strong>He was rejected from every public hospital in the city because they are full of patients at the ICU and he was also rejected from many private hospitals because of his age (+60 years) and COVID diagnosis</strong>. He was admitted only to one private hospital where they charged us 23650 USD for 10 days. This saved his life and now we need around $46600 USD in order to cover the expenses for the rest of his treatment and stay at the hospital. </p>
<p>NOTE: 95.139.665.365 Bs was the equivalent to 24000 USD on 09/19.</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Venezuela is facing a health crisis with a high cost of living due to hyperinflation, health prices, and practically no health care affordable for their citizens.</strong> The public hospitals are full and can't take more COVID patients, they can barely take care of the ones that are already there since they're lacking proper treatment and accessories for their doctors and nurses. Venezuela's current COVID statistics and numbers are getting higher and higher.</p>
<p>The options for private health care are almost non-existent for elderly people because of their price and lack of possibilities. In my home, we have three elderly citizens: my mom and dad, who are 63 years old, and my grandma, who is currently 85 years old.</p>
<p>For example: </p>
<ul>
<li>A blister of medicine called REMDISIVIR costs around 240-480 USD per dose (that lasts around 4 days) and it's not easy to buy it since most pharmacies have medicine shortages.</li>
<li>The rental of an oxygen concentrator costs around 180-300 USD per week.</li>
<li>One hour in a private ambulance for the patient to be transferred to a health institution can cost around 200-350 USD per hour and it depends on the distance traveled.</li>
<li>Most private hospitals ask for an amount of 12000-30000 USD in order to take the patient into the ICU and most of them ask for an upfront payment. Venezuela's minimum wage is 7.000.000 Bs (which is equal to $3 USD per month)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In Venezuela, elderly people don't have any rights or guarantees</strong>. There's no health care system for them. There are no vaccines. The basic services (water, electricity) don't work well. Many homes don't have clean water and there are electricity shortages almost every day. </p>
<h3><strong>That's why we need more support and help in order to cover all of the expenses. We want to give our father more days at the ICU to save his life. </strong></h3>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>OUR DAD'S CURRENT CLINICAL EVOLUTION WITH COVID-19</h2>
<ol>
<li>06/29: Our dad had his first vaccine shot. He was vaccinated with the Sputnik V vaccine (the one that comes from Russia). He has been waiting for his second shot for about three months and he's still waiting. The country is currently out of vaccines.</li>
<li>09/02: Our dad showed his first COVID-19 symptoms. He had a lot of fear and anxiety. </li>
<li>09/05: Our dad showed severe symptoms. His physician assigned him treatment and he was on constant watch.</li>
<li>09/11: Respiratory distress. He's showing moderate pneumonia symptoms and he's prescribed to do the treatment at home with an oxygen concentrator and mask. </li>
<li>09/18: Another respiratory distress and anxiety. He's facing a cytokine storm in his lungs. We did a second X-Ray on his chest. Our physician asks for our father to be transferred to a hospital. My family goes through a 24-hour living hell. He reaches a 33% level of oxygen saturation. </li>
<li>09/19: We managed to get our father admitted into a private hospital. His life was saved. He has been at Centro Médico Loira in Caracas since 5am. The hospital asks for a 24950 USD bill since he's going to stay at least 5 days in their ICU. The payment was upfront.</li>
<li>09/20: Our dad is diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis. When he entered the ICU he had oxygen saturation levels of 33%-55%. It is possible that we might need to extend his stay in the ICU for 7 - 12 days</li>
<li>09/22: Our dad showed some improvement in his health. The inflammation stopped. He shows low numbers on his blood test. He still remains in the ICU. </li>
</ol>
</div><div>
<h3>WHY SHOULD YOU HELP US?</h3>
<p>We want our dad to live again peacefully, with normal breathing. He has a lot of energy and he wants to make music again and see his family members abroad (myself included) He really wants to meet his grandchildren. nephews and nieces. He wants to be a happy grandpa after 45 years of hard work as a musician, tailor, taxi driver, etc.</p>
<p><strong>We want to give him 10 more days to live. We want to give him the opportunity to celebrate his next birthday in December. </strong></p>
<p>This campaign's goal will help us with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>3000 USD (or 2600 EUR) to cover my dad's expenses and to have emergency funds again. For the past two weeks, we have spent about 4000 USD on this emergency.</li>
<li>24000 USD (or 21000 EUR) to cover the loan we took in order to pay for his admission to the private hospital in Caracas. The budget covers 10 days in the hospital.</li>
<li>24000 USD (or 21000 EUR) to cover more days of ICU / his first month of tests and treatment after the hospital.</li>
</ul>

Somos Wendy y Wylkyns Racines, orgullosos hijos de Javier Racines, de 63 años, músico, sastre y un hombre de bien actualmente comprometido de salud y hospitalizado en la UCI de una Clínica Privada en Caracas, Venezuela, por infección bacteriana y fibrosis pulmonar, tras tormenta de citocinas en el Día 13 de tratamiento.
Fue rechazado en todos los hospitales públicos porque están ABARROTADOS de pacientes en UCI y también de varias clínicas por tener más de 60 años y ser paciente COVID-19, solo pudieron recibirlo en la clínica actual. 23560 USD por 10 días (factura a chttps://wa.link/rt39x5ontinuación) que le ha salvado la vida y ahora necesitamos 46.600 USD para garantizar 10 días adicionales en cuidado intensivo.
NOTA: 95.139.665.365,48 Bs. equivalían al cambio en 24.000 USD el 19/09

Venezuela vive una Emergencia Humanitaria Compleja con un alto costo de la vida, hiperinflación, y costos en el sistema de salud. Los hospitales tienen una atención muy precaria y están abarrotados por alza de contagios. El acceso a seguros de calidad para Adultos Mayores es limitado y de costo elevado. 
Por ejemplo:

6 ampollas de Remdisivir que utilizó en 4 días tienen un costo en Venezuela que oscila los 240-480 USD.
El costo de alquiler del concentrador de oxígeno en casa por 7 días oscila entre los 180-300 USD.
1 hora de ambulancia con bomba de oxígeno son entre 200-350 USD según las distancias.
Las clínicas privadas ofrecen ingresos a UCI en un rango de 12.000 a 30.000 USD de contado. El salario mínimo en Venezuela es de 7.000.000 Bs. (actualmente 3 USD).

 
En Venezuela los adultos mayores están desamparados, no hay ley que los proteja, no hay garantías en el sistema de salud, ni vacunas oportunamente. Los servicios fallan constantemente: en casa no hay agua ni Internet, la luz puede tener intermitencias en momentos inesperados. 
Pero necesitamos más redes de ayuda para sostener todos los costos y darle más días de UCI y hospital a mi padre para salvar su vida.

EVOLUCIÓN DEL COVID-19 EN PAPÁ

29/06 Nuestro papá fue vacunado con la primera dosis de la vacuna rusa Sputnik. Ha esperado semanas por la segunda dosis - sin éxito.
02/09 Tuvo sus primeros síntomas de COVID-19. Permanente ansiedad y miedo.
05/09 Presenta síntomas agudos, se le asigna monitoreo y un tratamiento.
11/09 Crisis respiratoria. Presenta neumonía moderada a grave y se le asigna hospitalización en casa, dependiendo de un concentrador de oxígeno.
12/09 Primeras placas de sus pulmones.
15/09 Muestra síntomas de mejora, inicia ejercicios de respiración y en ocasiones se retira la mascarilla del concentrador de oxígeno el mismo.
18/09 Crisis respiratoria y de ansiedad. Potencial Tormenta de citocinas. Segundas placas de sus pulmones (adjunta a continuación). Ordenan hospitalización formal. 24 horas de calvario. Pico más bajo de oxigenación en la sangre: 33.
19/09 Se logra hospitalización para salvar su vida en la clínica privada Centro Médico Loira de El Paraíso desde las 5:00 AM. con 5 días de ingreso a UCI y 5 días más de rehabilitación por un costo de 950 USD + 24.000 USD pago de contado.
20/09 Se diagnostica en UCI una fibrosis pulmonar. Al momento de entrar, volvió a tener picos de 55 y 33 en oxigenación. Lo más probable es que se deba extender los días en UCI y hospitalización hasta 10 días más.
22/09 Primeras síntomas leves de mejoraría. Se detiene la inflamación. Bajan los valores de proteína en la sangre. Se mantiene entubado y sedado en su 3er día de UCI.
03/10 Exámenes de sangre y placas han mejorado considerablemente, pero aún no ha podido despertarlo de la sedación esperando que el diafragma funcione.


¿POR QUÉ AYUDAR?
Queremos que nuestro padre vuelva a descansar tranquilo, pueda respirar y seguir viviendo con nosotros. Tiene mucha energía, muchas ganas de cantar y ver a sus familiares en el exterior, incluyéndome. Tiene ganas de conocer nietos y sobrinos nietos, de ser un abuelo feliz después de más de 45 años de trabajar en la calle como músico, vendedor, taxista, sastre, locutor, etc.

 
Queremos darle 10 días más de vida. Queremos darle la oportunidad de seguir adelante y celebrar su cumpleaños en diciembre.
 
La meta de donación nos ayudará a asumir lo siguiente:

3.000 USD (2600 EUR aprox) para cubrir gastos inmediatos y restablecer el fondo de emergencias. Hemos gastado hasta hoy 4000 USD en 2 semanas.
24.000 USD (21.000 EUR aprox) para cubrir el préstamo con garantía hipotecaria de nuestro domicilio en Caracas para el ingreso en clínica por 10 días.
24.000 USD (21.000 EUR aprox) para cubrir la potencial extensión de UCI por fibrosis pulmonar, cuidados de rehabilitación respiratoria, de fisioterapia física y medicamentos.

 
Gracias a todos por su valiosa ayuda. Cualquier aporte es IMPORTANTE y estaremos eternamente agradecidos. Nuestro papá JAVIER RACINES merece vivir y queremos darle toda la vida que nos ha dado como padre, esposo, hijo, hermano y amigo.
Ayudemos a que mi papá, Javier, siga cantando fuerte y claro.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">FAQ</h2>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Are any recurring fees to Daplie required?</strong></h3>
<p>There are no monthly fees required to use Daplie.<br/> </p>
<h3>What kind of internet do I need?</h3>
<p>Any broadband connection will do. Connect plugs into your home's modem or router directly via a normal Ethernet cable, which provides the most reliable and fastest access. If you live in an HOA which does not provide access to Ethernet, you can use a WiFi-Ethernet bridge. Satellite connections that are not always-on or that have strict upload limits may cause difficulty accessing Connect or streaming movies. Dial-up is not supported.<br/> </p>
<h3>Are there user limits?</h3>
<p>There is no limit to the number of users on the device or people you can share with or give access to on your Connect. There are no charges for users. You decide who can have access and what level of access they receive. Each user has a unique login. We provide the hardware and infrastructure, but you own the network.<br/> </p>
<h3>Do you use RAID?</h3>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Our general philosophy is that if there's a solution that fixes part of a problem and another solution that completely fixes a problem, <strong>we focus on the complete solution</strong>.</p>
<p>RAID only solves the problem of local redundancy (copying one drive to another in the same room) and we believe that off-site redundancy is an all-around better solution, so <strong>we recommend linking two or more Connect units together</strong>.<br/><br/>That said, you can use a RAID drive with Connect via USB.<br/> </p>
<h3>What if my house burns down?</h3>
<p><br/>We recommend that you <strong>keep backups</strong>. For example, you could <strong>link two Daplie systems</strong> together (perhaps yours and a family members).<br/><br/><strong>A backup is only a backup if you have 2 copies</strong>. For example, if you have one copy on some cloud storage and another copy on your computer, you have a backup. <strong>If you delete the original</strong> from your computer and only have the file on some cloud storage, <strong>you don't have a backup</strong>.</p>
<p>Also, how many times has your house burned down in comparison to how many times a ""the cloud"" service has either <strong>lost, deleted, replaced, or ransomed</strong> your stuff? ""the cloud"" services go out of business and change product lines or fail to renew content licenses on a regular basis. In all likelihood <strong>your house is a much, much safer place</strong> for your digital life than Google or Dropbox.<br/> </p>
<h3>Do I have to use one of your hard drives?</h3>
<p>Absolutely not. A regular USB drive can be used, but you must make sure it is empty when you start using it with Connect. Note, however, that most drives are not intended for nor warrantied for cloud system use.</p>
<p>For those who want the most reliable drives and the smoothest experience, we offer storage drives that plug right into the server and do not require any extra cords and don't take up much space.<br/> </p>
<h3>What are the Technical Specifications?</h3>
<p>On the inside, Connect is essentially a tablet without the screen and using faster and more reliable ethernet instead of WiFi. The exact production specifications will vary depending on volume, but will be multi-core ARM processor with  2GB RAM, 1Ghz, 2x Ethernet, 2x USB, Cold Storage Wallet with physical button.<br/> </p>
<h3><strong>What about Security?</strong></h3>
<p>Security is multi-faceted.</p>
<p>We focus on designing solutions that are technically secure (encryption, keypairs, tokens, etc), secure against social exploits (dialogs, codes, authentication), and convenient to use (because if it isn't convenient people just find a way around it).<br/> </p>
<h3><strong>How is this different from a NAS?</strong></h3>
<p>This is different from a NAS in the same way that an iPad is different from a build-it-yourself Desktop computer. It's easier to set up and use, has apps, is smaller, less powerful, more convenient, and doesn't require technical skills. It also is built to expand and connect to other devices and manage your smart home and blockchain assets and applications.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>Can this work without static IPs from the ISP?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it can.</p>
<p><strong>Won't I have to configure my router?</strong></p>
<p>Nope.</p>

Her illness has led her to many poor choices and for the past few years those choices have put her in a homeless situation with all of the troubles that come with that condition; Hunger, fear, cold, sickness, abuse, sadness, depression, pain, and more pain, and on and on...   She is difficult to help and most of the time beyond our help, but many good people try. If it were not for a few people never giving up and doing what they can for her she would surely have frozen or starved long before now.


Our daughter's condition has brought our attention to soooo many other poor souls who were - NO ARE - our neighbors. We can never judge them. We have not walked in their shoes.


 We have no idea why or how they are in this condition. But they still deserve our compassion; our love; our service.
This campaign is just our way to do a little more for a few more homeless people. We hope to relieve some of the suffering of a few more daughters like ours; a few more moms, sisters, brothers, dads, children, homeless persons. We don't care what choices brought them to this condition, what they look like, or what they smell like, or how repulsive they are, or whether or not they will use our donation wisely. We just want to serve them in the way they need to be helped and, to the best of our ability, in a way that will lift them from pain and cold and hunger even if it's just for a short time.Will you help?
The Impact
How many times have I seen a homeless person and passed them by - in too much of a hurry or a little sorry that I didn't have any change in my pocket right now. I say to myself - ""I'll donate next time."" or ""He looks healthy enough to me. Why doesn't he just go get a job."" or I ask myself ""What stupid choices has he made to land him here?"" WHO AM I TO JUDGE!!!  



Let's change our hearts. Let's DO a little. Let's give a little from our hearts.

Your donation will feed and warm homeless people this season. How many people can we help? That is all up to us (that includes you too). The more we donate the more we can bless our neighbors without a home. 
We solemly commit to spend every penny raised in this campaign to bless the lives of as many homeless people as we can.   Risks & Challenges I heard a story once about a little boy on a beach where many thousands of starfish had washed up and were dying in the sun and he was picking them up and, one by one, throwing them back into the sea. A beach comber asked him why he was throwing the starfish back into the sea ""You can't possibly save ALL of them. You can't make any difference."" said the beach comer. The little boy picked up another starfish and threw it back into the sea and replied ""Well maybe not but, I just made a difference for that one."" 

No matter how much we raise and contribute - the homeless will still be with us and will still need our help, donations, empathy, and love, but every penny donated to this cause will ease the pain and hunger (even if it's just a very little bit) of someone who IS a neighbor in need. We can't cure the problem, but we can always keep loving, serving, blessing, and maybe, just maybe, a few of them can be lifted and helped back on their feet. Let's make a difference for just one more, then another, then another.....   Other Ways You Can Help Some of us just can't contribute, that's Okay, but that doesn't mean you can't help:  You may already be contributing to many other good causes and we bless you for that. Thank you. Bless you.
You don't have to donate here. There are hundreds of other ways you can donate and serve, and it doesn't have to be just to the homeless. Take a few moments this season and brainstorm with family and friends about how you can help and serve your neighbors in need. Of coarse we hope you will donate a few pennies here as well. Every dollar we raise will be wisely and carefully used to lift, and feed, and warm, and serve a neighbor.
Do you have some time this season? Can you make some time? Homeless shelters are always happy for volunteers. Can you volunteer some ""time"" this year?
If not this holiday season - how about ANY other time? The homeless don't just need our help and love during the holidays.
Get the word out and make some noise. Share this with everyone in every way possible. 
Would you like to join our team? We would be happy to enlist you on the team and have your help making this holiday season a lot better for the homeless. Contact us by phone: 801-372-5585 or email: danielgwolfe@hotmail.com Use the Indiegogo share tools!",6.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Who are we? 

We are a small group of
entrepreneurs based in Chicago that specializes in media development that
ranges from photography to web design. Back in June of this year, we were asked
to film the September 10th Chef's Dinner at the Franciscan Outreach's Marquard Center. The goal was to produce a video

<h4><b>Why help the migrants in Calais?</b></h4></b></h4>
<p>Make no mistake; the migrant crisis is a humanitarian crisis. The men, woman and children at the camps in Calais are far from a dangerous 'swarm' of 'economic migrants' coming to exploit our benefit system and threaten the 'British' way of life. Factually the vast majority of migrants at our border in Calais are refugees exercising their legal right to seek asylum. They come from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Darfur and Somalia among many other countries that have been torn apart by conflict. As a fellow human-beings, I believe we have a moral obligation to take action to ensure that these refugees who have already suffered so much are not denied their most basic human rights. </p>
<h4><b>Who I am...</b></h4>
</div><div>
<h3></h3>
<p>My name is Tegan and I work in a Norfolk Primary school. I thought I would make use of my summer holidays by making a difference to those in need. I studied Politics at University so I have always been passionate about tackling social inequalities and protecting those most vulnerable in society. I am also a member of Amnesty International so I believe in promoting human rights, equality and dignity for all.</p>

We need all basic items including:blankets, clothes (warm/ waterproof/ outdoor), coats, jumpers, hats, trousers, socks, underwear, (outdoor) shoes, sleeping bags/ camp beds, pillows, tents, materials (to make/ insulate shelters), toiletries (in line with the doctors of the world checklist - please contact me for info), first aid & food  (tinned, non-perishable)
Please contact me to arrange collection. If you are further afield - drop me a message and I will put you in contact with a donation drop off point near you. 


Get involved! 

Join me on the 20th in delivering donations and/or volunteer at the camp. It would be great to have extra vehicles - just drop me a message. 

Share, share & share our campaign! 
Where will your money go?
We only need £200 to be able to afford to deliver donations to the camp this time next week! This will cover:


petrol (£75)
ferry crossing (£125)



So if we raise over £200, this will go towards:


Buying items in bulk which are most in need (e.g. shoes, socks, coats, jumpers)
Hiring a van (to transport even more essential items to people in need)
Funding more aid deliveries to Calais



Why help the migrants in Calais?
Make no mistake; the migrant crisis is a humanitarian crisis. The men, woman and children at the camps in Calais are far from a dangerous 'swarm' of 'economic migrants' coming to exploit our benefit system and threaten the 'British' way of life. Factually the vast majority of migrants at our border in Calais are refugees exercising their legal right to seek asylum. They come from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Darfur and Somalia among many other countries that have been torn apart by conflict. As a fellow human-beings, I believe we have a moral obligation to take action to ensure that these refugees who have already suffered so much are not denied their most basic human rights. 
Who I am...


My name is Tegan and I work in a Norfolk Primary school. I thought I would make use of my summer holidays by making a difference to those in need. I studied Politics at University so I have always been passionate about tackling social inequalities and protecting those most vulnerable in society. I am also a member of Amnesty International so I believe in promoting human rights, equality and dignity for all.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>This is <strong>The Human Experience Professional Counseling Services LLC</strong>.</p>
<p>Once you EXPERIENCE hurt/pain/trauma/etc., you have two choices, continue to EXPERIENCE suffering, or heal, learn, evolve and<i> </i>transform into a greater version of yourself, and reap a greater human EXPERIENCE. Like all people, I have experienced suffering. Through this suffering I have come to discover my purpose, helping others heal and transform themselves. Over 13 years ago, I changed my degree program, and direction in life, and dedicated myself to marrying my passion and purpose with a strong foundation of education and professional experience, in order to get to this point where I can make a positive impact on individuals, families, and communities. </p>
<p>Meaningful and sustainable outcomes result FROM healing and transforming individuals and bolstering their natural supports, and result IN healthier and happier individuals, families, and communities. THE-PCS provides a variety of evidenced-based counseling approaches and a variety of counseling modalities to support individual and family goals that can be experienced, observed, and measured.</p>
<p>While various approaches and models are used, the basis of THE-PCS revolves around the tenets of Humanistic and Existential models, which emphasizes: a strengths-based approach, unconditional positive regard for clients, stressed importance of validation and normalization (ALL behavior makes sense within context), while also challenging clients to transform and evolve because of, and in the face of, life's struggles.</p>
<p><strong>Who we will serve:</strong></p>

<strong>Population:</strong> Children, Adolescents, Adults, and Couples</li>
<li>
<strong>Target Issues:</strong> Depression, Anxiety, Internalizing/Externalizing Problems, Relationship Conflict, Trauma, Grief and Loss, Phase of Life Issues, Medical Issues, Male Issues, LBGTQ Issues, Victimization, Self-Harm, Substance Abuse (Refer when outside of scope)</li>
<li>
<strong>Services:</strong> Individual/Family/Couples/Group Counseling, Case Management, Psychoeducation, Coordination of Care for Psychiatric Services, Refer as needed to allied health professionals</li>
<li>
<strong>Modalities:</strong> Outpatient Counseling, School-Based Counseling (Kyrene/Chandler/Tempe), Hospital-Based Programming, In-Home Services (when circumstances warrant)</li>

<li>
<strong>Unique Programs:</strong><ul>
<li>
<i>The<strong>Teen</strong>Experience</i>: A customizable intensive outpatient program that provides adolescents and their family an opportunity to receive unparalleled psychoeducation, come face to face with mental/emotional/behavioral health concerns, and help remove barriers that aid in destructive behaviors. The TEEN Experience offers a 10-week or 12-week outpatient program. Unique partnership with the Trauma Center Wake up Youth Program (<a href=""https://www.traumawakeup.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.traumawakeup.com</a>).</li>
<li>
<strong>NexGenMen</strong>: I am on a personal mission to redefine what it means to be a “man”. We cannot afford another generation of men who cannot express emotions in healthy ways or resolve conflict through civil means. Out with the old stereotypes, in with the new definition of being a “man”, one who’s meaning includes servant leadership, emotional intelligence, compassion, real self-confidence, and one that positively impacts marriages, children, and workplaces. The program is aimed at males of all ages, as well as females who have been negatively affected by males.</li>
<li>The<strong>HSP</strong>Experience: As a Highly Sensitive Person, and a HSP specialized counselor, I specialize in the recognition of this well-studied trait that has affects nearly 20% of the population at one point or another. HSP’s, without knowledge, education, or training, often struggle with depression, anxiety, substance abuse disorders, and other self-defeating disorders and behaviors. Learn to manage the pitfalls of the HSP trait, but also learn how to use this very powerful trait for your benefit and the benefit of the rest of the world! (<a href=""http://hsperson.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://hsperson.com/</a>) </li>
<li>The<strong>Relationship</strong>Experience: The most impactful choice a person can make is entering, or not entering, into a relationship with another person. Vulnerability, trust, and love take center stage and set us up for the greatest symphony ever heard. However, at many points, and for many reasons, this beautiful music can stop, and lead to painful periods of silence. Whether you are single and scared of relationships, or currently in a relationship, let us validate all the pain that relationships can hand down, but also let us help you find new, healthier ways to experience a consummate relationship: passion, intimacy, and commitment. Learn researched strategies and methods that can lead to a more fulfilling experience in current and future relationships. (Utilizing the Gottman Method)</li>
<li>The<strong>Parent</strong>Experience: Parenthood, along with being in a relationship, is one of the most challenging roles a person may take on. Receive refuge, validation, self-care, and strategies to make your experience easier, and more fulfilling. Learn and experience researched strategies and methods that can lead to a more fulfilling experience as a guardian or parent. Utilize our partnership with allied health professionals to receive ever important self-care and support.</li>
<li>
<strong>MyRareDisorder</strong>Experience: As someone who lives with, and experiences life with a rare, neurological disorder, I am especially compassionate to those who have battled, and continue to battle living with rare, and often, unidentifiable disorders or diseases. It is true what they say, we are ALL unique and we ALL battle something! Share your story and experience what it is like to be heard, seen, and supported.</li>
<li>
<strong>Soundtracks&amp;Storytellers</strong>: Learn your story, share your story, inspire others. Your story very well could be the story someone else needs to hear in order to help them find resolutions in their own story. Through spoken word, poetry, music, or art, allow us to help you turn your story into a positive EXPERIENCE for yourself and others. </li>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p><strong>We need your help in raising $5,455</strong> (or the combination of $ and value of donated items/services). To eliminate unnecessary waste, I prefer that items are used, as long as they are serviceable and functional.</p>
<p> <strong>Specific needs include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Office Equipment (Laptop/Software/Printer/Ink)</li>
<li>Office Furniture (Couch, Rug, End Table, Lamp, Desk, Office Chair, File Cabinet, Bookcase, White Board)</li>
<li>Office Supplies (Binders, Notebooks, Journals, Paper, Art Supplies, Games) </li>
<li>Legal Services</li>
<li>Website Development and Tech Services</li>
<li>Marketing (Share/promote service through social media, word of mouth)</li>
<li>
<strong>MY PLEDGE. For every $100 that is donated (including value of donated item/service), I will be providing an hour worth of counseling services, pro bono. </strong>Services will be provided for a qualifying individual/family in need of counseling, but unable to afford. In addition, with permission from client(s), while also protecting identity, I will relay back to you how your donation, and the service they received, positively impacted his or her life. </li>
<li>Whether a personal contribution or a contribution by a local business, I would be happy to highlight you or your organization as a donor/sponsor.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Statistics tell us that, you, or someone you care about, is struggling, or has struggled, with mental health issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 in 5 people are experiencing, and living with, a mental health disorder. </li>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Risks? The only risk involved is NOT setting out on this venture. If I did not move forward with this vision and this mission, I could never, in good faith and with a good conscience, tell my 3 boys to follow their dreams. Simply put, I cannot fail. I will not fail.</p>
<p>Challenges? I said, ""I will not fail"", but I never said I wouldn't fall. I know there will be many challenges. Every step of my life journey has presented challenges, I expect this venture to be no different. I am at my best when helping others. However, I am not as good at asking for help from others. I can no longer expect clients to ask for help if I am unwilling to ask for help.</p>
<p>I have a baby on the way. I have a family to support. I am uncomfortable. I am scared.</p>
<p>I also know this is healthy, normal, and needed to grow. It is important that I experience this vulnerability, just as all of my clients do when they come to me. ""Will this counselor listen to me? Believe in me? Accept me as I am? Help me become greater than I am? Help me reach my goals?"" This requires vulnerability and trust. The answer to these questions could be ""no"", as often times it has been in the past for them, which is a fear and pain-producing experience. BUT, the answer could be ""yes"", at which point an entire life is able to be healed, restored, and transformed. </p>
<p>With the same vulnerable feelings, I am asking similar questions to you, in hopes that my mission and goals take true form in order to help others. Do you believe in my value that everyone should EXPERIENCE a meaningful, fulfilling, life? Do you see my vision? Do you believe in my vision? Do you believe in my abilities? Do you believe in me? Do you care? Can you help? </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help. If not monetarily or by donating a needed item, you can support this cause by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good 'ole fashion words of encouragement (480-249-8511, <a href=""mailto:ryanthecounselor@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ryanthecounselor@gmail.com</a>)</li>
<li>Spread the word that I am here to help. Share through social media (social media page and website still in development). Share with someone who needs help. </li>
<li>Provide input/feedback on any needs/services you think my organization can fulfill.</li>
<li>Commit to your own self-care plan (<a href=""http://www.olgaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.olgaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2</a>...)  </li>
<li>Share a personal story of overcoming a painful ""human experience"".</li>

I have a baby on the way. I have a family to support. I am uncomfortable. I am scared.
I also know this is healthy, normal, and needed to grow. It is important that I experience this vulnerability, just as all of my clients do when they come to me. ""Will this counselor listen to me? Believe in me? Accept me as I am? Help me become greater than I am? Help me reach my goals?"" This requires vulnerability and trust. The answer to these questions could be ""no"", as often times it has been in the past for them, which is a fear and pain-producing experience. BUT, the answer could be ""yes"", at which point an entire life is able to be healed, restored, and transformed. 
With the same vulnerable feelings, I am asking similar questions to you, in hopes that my mission and goals take true form in order to help others. Do you believe in my value that everyone should EXPERIENCE a meaningful, fulfilling, life? Do you see my vision? Do you believe in my vision? Do you believe in my abilities? Do you believe in me? Do you care? Can you help?

What I saw there left a lasting impression on me. That week exposed me to a corner of the world that I could never have imagined existed. I had the opportunity to stare the world’s largest human waste crisis in the face, and while it was difficult to fully comprehend at age 11, the harsh realities of what I saw there came flashing through my memory when my fraternity brother, Jason Witherspoon, approached me with a design for a waterless toilet in early September. Jason told me he wanted to build a waterless toilet, and he knew India was the place that needed it most. What we didn’t realize at the time, was just how desperate that need was…</p><p> </p><p>Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, <strong>says building toilets is a priority over temples</strong>. His <strong>finance minister, Arun Jaitley, committed the majority of his 4th budget to the government’s goal of ending defecating in the open by 2019.</strong> That will be 150 years since the birth of Mohandas Gandhi, who <strong>said good sanitation was more important than independence.</strong></p><p> </p><p>Indoor plumbing and working toilets—conveniences that so many take for granted—remain a rare luxury in much of the developing world. <strong>More than 770 million people in India lack adequate indoor sanitation facilities</strong>(WaterAid), forcing them to defecate outdoors, exposing the population at large to 100,000 tons of untreated human waste annually, and contributing to the spread of diseases that kill 450,000 each year. (WaterAid)</p><p> </p><p>Open defecation is disastrous when practiced by groups in close contact with each other. Given India’s rapidly growing, yet already massive and densely settled population, it proves impossible even in rural areas to keep human feces from crops, wells, food and contact with children. The impacts on health and human development due specifically to bacterial disease and worm infections are devastating…</p><p> </p><ul><li>
<strong>Around 564 million people, which is nearly half the population of India, defecate in the open</strong>. India accounts for 90% of the people in South Asia and 59% of the 1.1 billion people in the world who practice open defecation (UNDESA)</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>This creates 65 million kg of human waste that ends up in people’s living environments every single day—an amount that would fill London’s Wembley stadium to the roof (WHO)</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>Due to this waste overflow, inadequate sanitation is estimated to cause 280,000 diarrhoeal deaths annually (UNDESA)</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>According to the World Bank, poor sanitation causes India economic losses amounting to 6.4% of India’s GDP in 2006 or 53.8 billion USD(Rs. 2.4 trillion) per year, which is equivalent to $43 USD for every Indian per year.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>Open defecation poses a serious threat to the health of children in India. The practice is the main reason India reports the highest number of diarrhoeal deaths among children under-five in the world. (Unicef)</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>Every year, diarrhea kills 188,000 children under five in India. Children weakened by frequent diarrhea episodes are more vulnerable to malnutrition, stunting, and opportunistic infections such as pneumonia. About 43% of children in India suffer from some degree of malnutrition (Unicef)</li></ul><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486523359/i88ycibceq69thpf43bq.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Who is trying to solve it</strong></h2><p> </p><p>The Indian government, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has pledged to build millions of toilets to deal with the lack of sanitation. Unfortunately, reports suggest that many people aren't using the government toilets, especially in rural areas due to lack of management and safety concerns for women.</p><p>The real problem with the government toilets is that they are pit latrines that simply store waste; people either have to pay to get them emptied or do it themselves. No family wants to do that, especially in areas where the caste system is still so deeply entrenched. They don't want to be associated with the “untouchable” caste, which in many parts of India is still responsible for managing waste. And unfortunately, even if they are able to empty their latrine, the result is often the same as if the family had defecated in the open, as the waste is simply emptied into streets and waterways by manual scavengers.</p><p>Consider the opinion on government toilets from Tashira Devi, a 40 yr old woman from East Delhi working with WaterAid, an international charity that transforms lives by improving access to safe water, hygiene and sanitation...</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486523466/gnii4au8dqjhl9jvfr62.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p>It is clear that a sanitation solution built around community pit latrines is not going to solve the problem. <strong>These people need toilets</strong>. They need to be<strong> private</strong>, and they must not require utilities like <strong>water </strong>or <strong>electricity</strong> (basic necessities still widely inaccessible in India). My team and I are not the first ones to realize this. Waterless toilet solutions have been attempted in India and elsewhere countless times, but <strong>few have succeeded at scale due to, in our opinion, four main reasons.</strong></p><ol>
<li>
<strong>Cultural barriers:</strong> In the developing world, people squat when they defecate. Attempting to get these people to use a toilet that does not simulate their traditional way of defecating will never work. A number of waterless toilet solutions involve a seat and lid mechanism. This configuration generally makes people uncomfortable, and they will opt to continue to defecate in the open rather than change the way they defecate. A successful toilet must, as closely as possible, simulate the way in which the target user prefers to defecate.</li>
<li>
<strong>Additional waste products</strong>: Other waterless toilets will use some kind of additional waste product, usually a sealable bag, to contain waste with no water flush. This technique is not scalable, as the addition of additional waste to the equation results in a one step forward, two steps back situation. Asking users to load bags into their toilet will likely result in them opting for the tree by the river instead.</li>
<li>
<strong>Valuable tech:</strong> There has been some incredible tech developed to build toilets that can turn waste into valuable byproducts on the spot. These developments, while innovative and impressive, aren't a realistic solution. The moment technology with valuable components inside of it is introduced to the developing world, desperate individuals are likely to disassemble the product and sell off the parts. The toilet must be not only affordable, but it cannot contain anything worth selling on its own.</li>
<li>
<strong>Unrealistic implementation</strong>: By far the largest mistake waterless toilet developers make is attempting to build an end-all-be-all solution to this issue. The overwhelming majority of waterless toilet solutions involve a pit latrine system with the capability to process waste into valuable byproducts on the spot. These solutions typically propose a cluster of toilets be shared by multiple individuals. This solution falls short in a number of ways. First, the designs are typically high cost, as they are meant to be purchased/built by outside sources. Second, the issue of privacy for women remains. And finally, due to the “community” aspect of the latrine system, nobody wants to take responsibility for maintenance, typically leaving the toilets unusable after something breaks or they become too dirty.</li>
</ol><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Our Solution</strong></h2><p>Our toilet is uniquely designed. It is<strong> portable, personal, and affordable</strong>. It can’t be taken apart very easily, and if someone really wanted to disassemble it, they wouldn't be able to get any value from its components. Here is a basic outline of what it will look like:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486523708/estkpqkfdy7wdm68ajnb.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Ideally, the customer is able to purchase our toilet (made of hard plastics) for <strong>around the price of a day’s wages</strong>. Perhaps the toilet is purchased for them by a donor, or the government, but regardless of who is financing it, the cost should be <strong>affordable for the world’s poorest demographic to pay for it themselves.</strong></p><p>The customer then has the freedom to place their new toilet wherever they like, in their home, outside their home, or even right on top of their existing pit latrine. They stand on the standing bin, squat over the bowl just as they would outside, and their waste flows into the collection bin due to a superhydrophobic coating on the bowl. Their feces/urine is separated in the triangular component you see in the collection bin, and their waste collects,<strong> odor free</strong>, for up to two weeks (calculated for a family of 4).</p><p>This provides our customers with a totally<strong> private, personal, and </strong><strong>odor free</strong><strong> toilet solution</strong>, but most importantly, it gives them a sense of ownership of their very own toilet. <strong>No more waiting in lines, dealing with other people's mess, or fear of harm when using shared toilets.</strong></p><p>When their collection bin fills up, one of our locally hired employees comes to their home and extracts their waste, leaving the user with an empty toilet. We have modeled out a number of methods for this extraction process, and look forward to examining them further once we arrive in India. This step will likely take some testing before we decipher what method works best.</p><p>*If you are interested in learning about our proposed extraction models, please feel free to reach out to us.</p><p>Upon extraction, the waste is taken by trucks to a remote processing facility. At the facility, we take the technology of anaerobic digestion and replicate it with low-cost materials like brick, cement, and wood. Below are some images of a similar low-cost anaerobic digestion plant designed by the Army corps of engineers.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486524017/pibtnnow0tsikm248add.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>This plant design uses <strong>cheap components and doesn't take long to build</strong>. It is highly scalable and incredibly efficient. The waste is dumped into the brick domes, where bacteria is introduced to the solution, and the anaerobic digestion reaction results in the production of biogas.</p><p>We can capture this biogas and use it in a number of ways. Initially, we can use the gas to run the plants and fuel the trucks sustainably, but if we are to succeed at scale, the excess gas can be sold to the Indian government and other energy consumers as a revenue source. In fact, we could even introduce biogas as the next phase of our “utility service”, bringing energy to people who have never before had access to it, in the form of bottled biogas</p><p>Imagine, if down the road, we could produce and sell inexpensive biogas stoves, lights, fans, etc. We could then include a monthly supply of bottled biogas, sourced from the customers waste, as a part of our service</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Where we’re at now:</strong></h2><p>Over the course of the last five months, we have been working tirelessly on this ""rough draft"" for a solution to India's devastating waste crisis.  After some validation and signs of support from esteemed organizations working to solve this issue in India like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Manila Housing Trust, <strong>we have decided to embark on a research trip in partnership with the Gates foundation. </strong>We will be traveling to New Delhi during our spring break to test our first toilet prototypes and gather information that will allow us to further test the feasibility of our solution.</p><h2> </h2><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Now we need your help</strong></h2><p> </p><p>The funds we are raising for this campaign will go towards helping us develop and bring our first toilet prototype to India.

Below is a high-level description of our cause. For a more detailed look in to our solution, please continue reading. Thank you! Problem: -- Roughly 2B people don’t have toilets-- Their only option is to defecate outside-- This causes pollution, disease, malnutrition, and embarrassment Current solutions aren’t working because they are: -- Too expensive-- Mismanaged or not serviced at all-- Culturally inappropriate-- Equipment breaks and becomes unusableOur solution is a combination of an innovative, toilet and a subscription-based service to remove and process waste.The toilet is: -- Clean, odor-free, waterless, electricity-free-- Portable-- Extremely low-cost-- Private and personal The waste-removal service is: -- Inexpensive-- Efficient-- Scalable-- Self-powered What’s next: -- Research trip-- Prototype dev-- Beta testing What we need $10K for: --Prototype Development-Material costs -Machining--Travel expenses The Problem In the summer of 2008, I had the incredible opportunity to travel with my family to India. What I saw there left a lasting impression on me. That week exposed me to a corner of the world that I could never have imagined existed. I had the opportunity to stare the world’s largest human waste crisis in the face, and while it was difficult to fully comprehend at age 11, the harsh realities of what I saw there came flashing through my memory when my fraternity brother, Jason Witherspoon, approached me with a design for a waterless toilet in early September. Jason told me he wanted to build a waterless toilet, and he knew India was the place that needed it most. What we didn’t realize at the time, was just how desperate that need was… Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, says building toilets is a priority over temples. His finance minister, Arun Jaitley, committed the majority of his 4th budget to the government’s goal of ending defecating in the open by 2019. That will be 150 years since the birth of Mohandas Gandhi, who said good sanitation was more important than independence. Indoor plumbing and working toilets—conveniences that so many take for granted—remain a rare luxury in much of the developing world. More than 770 million people in India lack adequate indoor sanitation facilities(WaterAid), forcing them to defecate outdoors, exposing the population at large to 100,000 tons of untreated human waste annually, and contributing to the spread of diseases that kill 450,000 each year. (WaterAid) Open defecation is disastrous when practiced by groups in close contact with each other. Given India’s rapidly growing, yet already massive and densely settled population, it proves impossible even in rural areas to keep human feces from crops, wells, food and contact with children. The impacts on health and human development due specifically to bacterial disease and worm infections are devastating… 
Around 564 million people, which is nearly half the population of India, defecate in the open. India accounts for 90% of the people in South Asia and 59% of the 1.1 billion people in the world who practice open defecation (UNDESA) This creates 65 million kg of human waste that ends up in people’s living environments every single day—an amount that would fill London’s Wembley stadium to the roof (WHO) Due to this waste overflow, inadequate sanitation is estimated to cause 280,000 diarrhoeal deaths annually (UNDESA) According to the World Bank, poor sanitation causes India economic losses amounting to 6.4% of India’s GDP in 2006 or 53.8 billion USD(Rs. 2.4 trillion) per year, which is equivalent to $43 USD for every Indian per year. Open defecation poses a serious threat to the health of children in India. The practice is the main reason India reports the highest number of diarrhoeal deaths among children under-five in the world. (Unicef) Every year, diarrhea kills 188,000 children under five in India. Children weakened by frequent diarrhea episodes are more vulnerable to malnutrition, stunting, and opportunistic infections such as pneumonia. About 43% of children in India suffer from some degree of malnutrition (Unicef)     Who is trying to solve it The Indian government, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has pledged to build millions of toilets to deal with the lack of sanitation. Unfortunately, reports suggest that many people aren't using the government toilets, especially in rural areas due to lack of management and safety concerns for women.The real problem with the government toilets is that they are pit latrines that simply store waste; people either have to pay to get them emptied or do it themselves. No family wants to do that, especially in areas where the caste system is still so deeply entrenched. They don't want to be associated with the “untouchable” caste, which in many parts of India is still responsible for managing waste. And unfortunately, even if they are able to empty their latrine, the result is often the same as if the family had defecated in the open, as the waste is simply emptied into streets and waterways by manual scavengers.Consider the opinion on government toilets from Tashira Devi, a 40 yr old woman from East Delhi working with WaterAid, an international charity that transforms lives by improving access to safe water, hygiene and sanitation... It is clear that a sanitation solution built around community pit latrines is not going to solve the problem. These people need toilets. They need to be private, and they must not require utilities like water or electricity (basic necessities still widely inaccessible in India). My team and I are not the first ones to realize this. Waterless toilet solutions have been attempted in India and elsewhere countless times, but few have succeeded at scale due to, in our opinion, four main reasons.

Cultural barriers: In the developing world, people squat when they defecate. Attempting to get these people to use a toilet that does not simulate their traditional way of defecating will never work. A number of waterless toilet solutions involve a seat and lid mechanism. This configuration generally makes people uncomfortable, and they will opt to continue to defecate in the open rather than change the way they defecate. A successful toilet must, as closely as possible, simulate the way in which the target user prefers to defecate.

Additional waste products: Other waterless toilets will use some kind of additional waste product, usually a sealable bag, to contain waste with no water flush. This technique is not scalable, as the addition of additional waste to the equation results in a one step forward, two steps back situation. Asking users to load bags into their toilet will likely result in them opting for the tree by the river instead.

Valuable tech: There has been some incredible tech developed to build toilets that can turn waste into valuable byproducts on the spot. These developments, while innovative and impressive, aren't a realistic solution. The moment technology with valuable components inside of it is introduced to the developing world, desperate individuals are likely to disassemble the product and sell off the parts. The toilet must be not only affordable, but it cannot contain anything worth selling on its own.

Unrealistic implementation: By far the largest mistake waterless toilet developers make is attempting to build an end-all-be-all solution to this issue. The overwhelming majority of waterless toilet solutions involve a pit latrine system with the capability to process waste into valuable byproducts on the spot. These solutions typically propose a cluster of toilets be shared by multiple individuals. This solution falls short in a number of ways. First, the designs are typically high cost, as they are meant to be purchased/built by outside sources. Second, the issue of privacy for women remains. And finally, due to the “community” aspect of the latrine system, nobody wants to take responsibility for maintenance, typically leaving the toilets unusable after something breaks or they become too dirty.
 Our SolutionOur toilet is uniquely designed. It is portable, personal, and affordable. It can’t be taken apart very easily, and if someone really wanted to disassemble it, they wouldn't be able to get any value from its components. Here is a basic outline of what it will look like: Ideally, the customer is able to purchase our toilet (made of hard plastics) for around the price of a day’s wages. Perhaps the toilet is purchased for them by a donor, or the government, but regardless of who is financing it, the cost should be affordable for the world’s poorest demographic to pay for it themselves.The customer then has the freedom to place their new toilet wherever they like, in their home, outside their home, or even right on top of their existing pit latrine. They stand on the standing bin, squat over the bowl just as they would outside, and their waste flows into the collection bin due to a superhydrophobic coating on the bowl. Their feces/urine is separated in the triangular component you see in the collection bin, and their waste collects, odor free, for up to two weeks (calculated for a family of 4).This provides our customers with a totally private, personal, and odor free toilet solution, but most importantly, it gives them a sense of ownership of their very own toilet. No more waiting in lines, dealing with other people's mess, or fear of harm when using shared toilets.When their collection bin fills up, one of our locally hired employees comes to their home and extracts their waste, leaving the user with an empty toilet. We have modeled out a number of methods for this extraction process, and look forward to examining them further once we arrive in India. This step will likely take some testing before we decipher what method works best.*If you are interested in learning about our proposed extraction models, please feel free to reach out to us.Upon extraction, the waste is taken by trucks to a remote processing facility. At the facility, we take the technology of anaerobic digestion and replicate it with low-cost materials like brick, cement, and wood. Below are some images of a similar low-cost anaerobic digestion plant designed by the Army corps of engineers.This plant design uses cheap components and doesn't take long to build. It is highly scalable and incredibly efficient. The waste is dumped into the brick domes, where bacteria is introduced to the solution, and the anaerobic digestion reaction results in the production of biogas.We can capture this biogas and use it in a number of ways. Initially, we can use the gas to run the plants and fuel the trucks sustainably, but if we are to succeed at scale, the excess gas can be sold to the Indian government and other energy consumers as a revenue source. In fact, we could even introduce biogas as the next phase of our “utility service”, bringing energy to people who have never before had access to it, in the form of bottled biogasImagine, if down the road, we could produce and sell inexpensive biogas stoves, lights, fans, etc. We could then include a monthly supply of bottled biogas, sourced from the customers waste, as a part of our serviceWhere we’re at now:Over the course of the last five months, we have been working tirelessly on this ""rough draft"" for a solution to India's devastating waste crisis.  After some validation and signs of support from esteemed organizations working to solve this issue in India like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Manila Housing Trust, we have decided to embark on a research trip in partnership with the Gates foundation. We will be traveling to New Delhi during our spring break to test our first toilet prototypes and gather information that will allow us to further test the feasibility of our solution. Now we need your help The funds we are raising for this campaign will go towards helping us develop and bring our first toilet prototype to India. Your donation is a critical piece in making this solution a reality. With your help, we will be able to critically analyze whether what we have spent the last five months dreaming up can truly change the world like we think it can.

<p>We are asking for two tiers of contributions.  The first tier is only $30 and you will receive a 4oz bottle of our original Zone Insect Repellent spray.  The second tier is $50 and you will receive a 4oz bottle of the original spray plus a 4oz bottle of our non-scented Sensitive Skin formula.</p>
<p>Zone Insect Repellents are DEET-Free, Picaridin-based, EPA approved and proven effective worldwide for 12-hrs against mosquitoes, ticks, flies, fleas, chiggers, gnats and no-seeums.  It is completely safe for adults, children and pregnant women.  In addition, our formulation feels and smells great!  If you have allergies or are sensitive to odors, our Sensitive Skin formula is non-scented, hypoallergenic and still has the same great effectiveness against bugs.</p>
<p>We have a goal to raise at least $50,000.  With those funds, we will be able to send thousands of bottles of Zone repellent to Zambia, West Africa, South and Central America and Southeast Asia.  We are working with numerous humanitarian aid organizations to coordinate shipments and distribution to the highest danger areas.  These organizations such as the International Red Cross, UNICEF, Malaria No More, the World Health Organization and others also need inventory of Zone repellent for their workers and other distribution.</p>
<p>The risks and challenges for our mission is a lack of funds.  As a growing business in Alabama, we are educating the U.S. consumers about Picaridin and how it is the best alternative to DEET products.  As we grow and our revenues increase, portions of every dollar are used to send Zone Insect Repellent to other parts of the world.  As you can imagine, this is very difficult to do effectively for a young company which is why we need your help.</p>
<p>If you cannot help us financially at this point with at least a $30 contribution, you can still help us by spreading the word about our company and about Zone Insect Repellents.  The more we grow, the more retail orders we receive, the more likes and shares we get on social media, the more we can use portions of our revenue to help these children.  So, if you can’t contribute today, please try a bottle of Zone Insect Repellent and then spread the word.</p>

<p>Hello,</p> <p>My name is Grace Dyas. I am an artist and activist from Dublin. I am writing on behalf of Emma Fraser and myself. We co-founded and co-authored NOT AT HOME in 2016.</p> <p>NOT AT HOME is a durational art campaign, to make visible the experiences of women who travel abroad to access safe abortion services, to highlight the consequences of Ireland's abortion laws and to connect women who have travelled in solidarity.</p> <p>NOT AT HOME has, since its inception, been designed to be accessible to those on all sides, those who are still undecided and those who currently feel unequipped to make an informed choice. It is completely non-partisan. While we, as creators, have our own views on abortion, the only words spoken in the piece are the experiences of women who have travelled to access safe abortion services.</p> <p>However, we are hitting some bumps in the road as we travel Ireland, and this is where we really need your help.</p> <p>Though non-partisan, NOT AT HOME has been met with silencing and censorship in the form of last-minute venue cancellations due to pressure brought to bear against theatres and other venues, as well as the resurrecting of old fears and shame, which has been as effective as ever at killing freedom of expression.</p> <p>We have dealt with 5 cancellations of the work, after complaints were received and boards put pressure on venue managers to cancel the show as they felt to protect their funding they would need to appear neutral. This has been highlighted by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties - see here: <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/civil-liberties-group-unveils-repeal-mural-calls-out-chilling-effect-of-censorship-1.3499407"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/civil-libert...</a>.</p>
<br/><p>We are living in an Ireland where saying the true experiences of women out loud in public has become a ‘political’ act.</p> <p>As a result of these cancellations, we have lost funding and incurred extra costs: overtime; equipment rental; and the biggest expense - sourcing new venues while already on the road. Some of the venues that cancelled have given us part of our fee back, but despite this, we are still in deficit.</p>
<p>We fundraised ourselves entirely for the tour, we raised over 28,000euros. We are now facing a deficit.</p> <p>If the piece owes money, only we will be punished for these cancellations. It will send the message, that if you speak, if you break the silence, if you do something artistically courageous - you will be punished for it</p>

</div></div>","Hello, My name is Grace Dyas. I am an artist and activist from Dublin. I am writing on behalf of Emma Fraser and myself. We co-founded and co-authored NOT AT HOME in 2016. NOT AT HOME is a durational art campaign, to make visible the experiences of women who travel abroad to access safe abortion services, to highlight the consequences of Ireland's abortion laws and to connect women who have travelled in solidarity. NOT AT HOME has, since its inception, been designed to be accessible to those on all sides, those who are still undecided and those who currently feel unequipped to make an informed choice. It is completely non-partisan. While we, as creators, have our own views on abortion, the only words spoken in the piece are the experiences of women who have travelled to access safe abortion services. However, we are hitting some bumps in the road as we travel Ireland, and this is where we really need your help. Though non-partisan, NOT AT HOME has been met with silencing and censorship in the form of last-minute venue cancellations due to pressure brought to bear against theatres and other venues, as well as the resurrecting of old fears and shame, which has been as effective as ever at killing freedom of expression. We have dealt with 5 cancellations of the work, after complaints were received and boards put pressure on venue managers to cancel the show as they felt to protect their funding they would need to appear neutral. This has been highlighted by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties - see here: https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/civil-libert....
We are living in an Ireland where saying the true experiences of women out loud in public has become a ‘political’ act. As a result of these cancellations, we have lost funding and incurred extra costs: overtime; equipment rental; and the biggest expense - sourcing new venues while already on the road. Some of the venues that cancelled have given us part of our fee back, but despite this, we are still in deficit.
We fundraised ourselves entirely for the tour, we raised over 28,000euros. We are now facing a deficit. If the piece owes money, only we will be punished for these cancellations. It will send the message, that if you speak, if you break the silence, if you do something artistically courageous - you will be punished for it

We
believe in the empowerment of women. We also believe that one person can evolve
as a human being through body, mind, heart, and soul to effect change; that
knowledge is power; that with persistence and determination one can overcome
all obstacles; that, given consistent support, all women can achieve
self-empowerment; and that daily small actions will evolve to create larger
change. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/298384/files/20140108165731-Screen_Shot_2014-01-08_at_7.56.58_PM.png?1389229051"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We
are Women’s Integration Network Inc., an innovative collaborative community
initiative currently based in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Gathering together
experts in the fields of social work, therapy, research, and project management
we are developing programs and initiating research to promote awareness of the
challenges faced by vulnerable women in Canada. Our vision is to facilitate an
environment that will be conducive to enable women to achieve self-empowerment.
</p>
<p>Mission
of WIN Inc.: Evolving communities one person at a time, changing legacies. </p>
<p>When
we look around in society, we recognize that on an individual level many people
would identify themselves as disempowered. It is this disempowerment that we
seek to address. The members of WIN Inc. understand that when empowerment
happens there is a ripple effect that touches every part of a person’s life.
It’s effect spreads and influences events or situations far beyond where it
started. It spreads to family, friends, and co-workers.</p>
<p>We
have a vision to develop programs that address some of the profound inequities,
injustices and oppressions that are prevalent in society. The New Beginnings
Program is targeted at providing support to vulnerable women relocating to
urban centers often from conditions of poverty, violence, and abuse, and who
would benefit from support to transition into their new life. For the initial
implementation, the program will focus on vulnerable women relocating to
Ottawa. </p>
<p>We
acknowledge that in taking a proactive stance, any woman could be identified as
vulnerable. Thus, we cannot limit our work through the use of any other labels.
Our clients will come from all ethnic groups, all socio-economic statuses, all
sexual orientations, all ability levels, all ages, and all religions. Their
commonality will be that they have sought support. </p>
<p>We
recognize that the structure of Canadian society enacts various gender, race,
and class based oppressions that affect individual women. At the core of our
work, we seek to address a self-identified vulnerability that can result in
disempowerment, disenfranchisement, and disengagement. Working in North
America, we understand that there are societal, cultural, and familial
definitions of vulnerability that we must work within. Our work, however, takes
a proactive and empowered stance. While our partners and other key supporters
may identify vulnerability from the outside looking in, we will support women
who seek support based on their own understanding of their vulnerability. </p>
<p>We
also recognize that the gaps in the current model of service provision in North
America can further marginalize women. 
We have a vision to develop partnerships and engage harmonious
organizations in direct service provision agreements that address these gaps.</p>
<p>Based
on current research available, we cannot presume to understand the larger
societal, cultural, familial, and individual oppressions that intersect at the
root of each individual woman’s challenges. We recognize that there may be
commonalities, but the lack of data limits this understanding. We have a vision
to develop a long-term research project in partnership with harmonious
organizations that will address these continued gaps in knowledge. </p>
<p>In
developing these visions, WIN Inc. has demonstrated a long-standing and
powerful belief in the role of empowerment in creating change. It is our belief
that empowerment has the power to create lasting change at all levels, that
will continue for generations to come. It is in working with individuals that
we seek to create larger familial, community, and societal changes.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Hello!
My name is Alexandria Smith, but I go by Rain. </p>
<p>Rain reminds me to be nourishing and
that is what I hope my life will be. My simple dream is...</p>
<p>To
spread love like it's contagious</p>
<p>Like
through the struggle and the strife</p>
<p>We
CAN keep ALIVE all that inspires and amazes!</p>
<p>I
am an advocate for social justice, civil rights, environmental well-being, and
the reality of what it means to be, to hold, to share, to create Peace! I am a
woman, indigenous to Earth, with a strong, vital and positive message to share!
I am an idealist that stubbornly believes in the potential of human creativity
and refuses to put up with a cultural status quo that is deceptive,
inefficient, corrupt, shallow, demeaning, and harmful to people and other
living things.</p>
<p>I am launching this fundraising
campaign, primarily, to help me get from Missoula, Montana to The Hague in the
Netherlands this April 2015. </p>
<p>I am a 3 year member of the Women's
International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF). This historic organization
is approaching 100 years of international collaboration, support and
empowerment towards the creation of peace. In April
of 1915, women around the globe gathered to make known the causes of war and to
work towards its elimination. I am humbled by the work of this organization
that (among so many other things) brings women of Syria together with women of Bosnia to realize their
shared experience, to make known their differences, to discuss what efforts
have achieved change, what efforts have failed and why. </p>
<p>WILPF is holding two three day
conferences to celebrate these past 100 years and reestablish a strong foundation for
the next 100 years of Women organizing for Peace, women of the world networking
and learning from one another to ready ourselves for the challenges ahead. I
have been invited to share my poetry with other international poets, musicians
and performers as part of a festival night during the second of these
conferences.</p>
<p>But ultimately I am seeking the
funds to help me go further than The Hague. I want to grow and share my own potential as
an activist who is ready to inspire local and global communities to network for
real change that will help support and inspire each other as we nurture a
healthier, more vibrant future.</p>
<br/>
</div>
</div> <div> <h3>This is What I Need...<br/>
</h3>I've divided what I can do with how much I am able to raise.
<p>$3,500-4,000 is my primary goal. If I can raise that much I can...</p>
<p>Create flyers for events I hope to hold leading up to the beginning of my journey, including events held along the way as I venture to Whitefish MT, Madison WI, and Chicago IL where I'll fly to the Netherlands... and come back- possibly via LA, San Francisco, Portland- Though for that I may need to raise an additional $500 (making it $4,000).<br/></p>
<p>This is primarily for gas money, train tickets, bus-fares, airfare, nutritious snacks...</p>
<p>I will be in the Netherlands, attending both the WILPF (members only) Congress and the International (open to all Peacekeepers) Conference, for 9 days.<br/></p>
<p>I am hoping to use the coming months to network with some other WILPF members in order to, ideally, find one or more home-stay options while I am at the conferences. Or at least find some fellow travelers I may be able to share the cost of a room with or learn about safe hostels. If I am able to home-stay I would still like to offer a gift in exchange. I may have trouble finding a home stay or cheap lodging, so my estimate is buffered to account for an unforeseen necessity to pay for lodging.<br/></p>
<p>This would also include making business cards for networking. (I regret not having my own cards when I attended the UN Commission on the Status of Women last year- as a WILPF delegate)</p>
<p>If I can grow my funds beyond this beginning, another $3,500 would build upon my ability to...</p>
<p>$500: I can self-publish my 1st collection of original Poetry. -I can make 500, 18-20-page booklets on hemp paper. ...Just $1 a book!</p>
<p>$100: (at the most) Will purchase a small sound recorder with a USB. This devise is a valuable tool that could greatly enhance my journalistic, community organization, and activist endeavors.</p>
<p>$1000: Will enable me to create at least 4 separate tours to local and regional towns in Montana, Idaho, and Washington (at least 18 towns/cities). These tours would primarily be to share insights gained through my journey to the Hague as well as important community empowerment tools I have been learning about throughout my adulthood. They would incorporate the sharing of healthful foods, open discussions, and creativity. The money would pay for bus-fare, gas for rideshare, nutritious foods to share, printing informational pamphlets and possibly lodging expenses.</p>
<p>$100: Would be used to add some incredible insight to my repertoire in the form of books: Be
the Change: How to get what you want in your community; Sacred
Economics by Charles Eisenstein; Profit over People by Noam Chomsky; No Logo and The Shock Doctrine by Naomi Klein.</p>
<p>If enough people believe in the power of words, of wisdom, of our innate and mysterious creativity to help me raise an additional $1,300... I will donate that money to 2 organizations- One in India and One in Afghanistan that are working to educate and build equal rights for women. I don't know what those organizations are called yet- But I KNOW that when I make this journey I will discover them and their advocates will move me beyond the tears of Rain.<br/></p>

It's called 'So it Goes from no Easy Chair.'<br/><br/><p>
</p>
<p>Not only am I a member of WILPF, I
am on the board of a locally founded social justice group called Community
Action for Justice in the Americas, Asia and Africa (CAJA<sup>3</sup>), I am
part of two coalitions of organizations and individuals, both are working to educate and empower community action to protect the foundations of our ability to live healthfully and with true economic security and stability.<br/></p>
<p>I help produce a program on our
local, independent college radio station, KBGA Missoula 89.9fm. It’s the Outer
Limits Radio Show and through it we create an audio montage, a scrapbook of
sound- interviews, newsreels, documentaries, expert voices; doing our best to cover a variety of global to local issues that are
often skewed or ignored by the ownership of mainstream media.</p>
<p>In the past few years I have been
facing the challenges and fears of my youth: low self-esteem, depression, stage
fright. I have traveled between Missoula MT and San Francisco CA sharing poetry
and hosting events that encourage everyone to be creative and share their arts! I want to continue this work and pursue deeper outreach to youth, to the homeless, to the imprisoned, and to the depressed.</p>

<p>Please share this campaign; if only
to people you know personally and with a personal message. Spread it far and

much more than a dollar could do!</p><p>Look up and consider becoming a member of Women's International League for Peace and Freedom: <a href=""http://www.wilpfinternational.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.wilpfinternational.org/</a></p><p>The ICAN Campaign: <a href=""http://www.icanw.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.icanw.org/</a> <br/></p><p>Learn about other parts of the world: India, China, Afghanistan, Syria, Iran, Serbia, Bosnia, Russia, Ukraine, etc- but seek insight and knowledge from independent sources, use the internet to find people from those places to connect with and learn from. Grow your awareness to perceive that within our own country there are a variety of contentious perspectives that completely contradict each other, yet claim to know beyond any doubt that what they believe about certain events, leaders, economic and militaristic pursuits are unquestionable truth. One thing I know for certain is that the statement I just made can be said from within any nation-state. <br/></p><p>There are no constants. The truth is amorphous. Learn and know thyself. Grow relationships you can trust within your own community and abroad. Change is coming and if we all participate from a foundation of peace, healing and revitalizing our innate creativity- there's something incredibly profound to be achieved.<br/></p><p>Thank you for your own Journey

am an advocate for social justice, civil rights, environmental well-being, and
the reality of what it means to be, to hold, to share, to create Peace! I am a
woman, indigenous to Earth, with a strong, vital and positive message to share!
I am an idealist that stubbornly believes in the potential of human creativity
and refuses to put up with a cultural status quo that is deceptive,
inefficient, corrupt, shallow, demeaning, and harmful to people and other
living things.
I am launching this fundraising
campaign, primarily, to help me get from Missoula, Montana to The Hague in the
Netherlands this April 2015. 
I am a 3 year member of the Women's
International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF). This historic organization
is approaching 100 years of international collaboration, support and
empowerment towards the creation of peace. In April
of 1915, women around the globe gathered to make known the causes of war and to
work towards its elimination. I am humbled by the work of this organization
that (among so many other things) brings women of Syria together with women of Bosnia to realize their
shared experience, to make known their differences, to discuss what efforts
have achieved change, what efforts have failed and why. 
WILPF is holding two three day
conferences to celebrate these past 100 years and reestablish a strong foundation for
the next 100 years of Women organizing for Peace, women of the world networking
and learning from one another to ready ourselves for the challenges ahead. I
have been invited to share my poetry with other international poets, musicians
and performers as part of a festival night during the second of these
conferences.
But ultimately I am seeking the
funds to help me go further than The Hague. I want to grow and share my own potential as
an activist who is ready to inspire local and global communities to network for
real change that will help support and inspire each other as we nurture a
healthier, more vibrant future.


  This is What I Need...
I've divided what I can do with how much I am able to raise.
$3,500-4,000 is my primary goal. If I can raise that much I can...
Create flyers for events I hope to hold leading up to the beginning of my journey, including events held along the way as I venture to Whitefish MT, Madison WI, and Chicago IL where I'll fly to the Netherlands... and come back- possibly via LA, San Francisco, Portland- Though for that I may need to raise an additional $500 (making it $4,000).
This is primarily for gas money, train tickets, bus-fares, airfare, nutritious snacks...
I will be in the Netherlands, attending both the WILPF (members only) Congress and the International (open to all Peacekeepers) Conference, for 9 days.
I am hoping to use the coming months to network with some other WILPF members in order to, ideally, find one or more home-stay options while I am at the conferences. Or at least find some fellow travelers I may be able to share the cost of a room with or learn about safe hostels. If I am able to home-stay I would still like to offer a gift in exchange. I may have trouble finding a home stay or cheap lodging, so my estimate is buffered to account for an unforeseen necessity to pay for lodging.
This would also include making business cards for networking. (I regret not having my own cards when I attended the UN Commission on the Status of Women last year- as a WILPF delegate)
If I can grow my funds beyond this beginning, another $3,500 would build upon my ability to...
$500: I can self-publish my 1st collection of original Poetry. -I can make 500, 18-20-page booklets on hemp paper. ...Just $1 a book!
$100: (at the most) Will purchase a small sound recorder with a USB. This devise is a valuable tool that could greatly enhance my journalistic, community organization, and activist endeavors.
$1000: Will enable me to create at least 4 separate tours to local and regional towns in Montana, Idaho, and Washington (at least 18 towns/cities). These tours would primarily be to share insights gained through my journey to the Hague as well as important community empowerment tools I have been learning about throughout my adulthood. They would incorporate the sharing of healthful foods, open discussions, and creativity. The money would pay for bus-fare, gas for rideshare, nutritious foods to share, printing informational pamphlets and possibly lodging expenses.
$100: Would be used to add some incredible insight to my repertoire in the form of books: Be
the Change: How to get what you want in your community; Sacred
Economics by Charles Eisenstein; Profit over People by Noam Chomsky; No Logo and The Shock Doctrine by Naomi Klein.
If enough people believe in the power of words, of wisdom, of our innate and mysterious creativity to help me raise an additional $1,300... I will donate that money to 2 organizations- One in India and One in Afghanistan that are working to educate and build equal rights for women. I don't know what those organizations are called yet- But I KNOW that when I make this journey I will discover them and their advocates will move me beyond the tears of Rain.

    The Potency of Poetry and the Power of Communion
...We ride these wavesinto our gravesfewlearning now'a'daysthat it's Life that savesInstead we set ablazetrample and pavethe field and forestthis Sacred Creationthat we've been blessed withAnd I want to address this!So many years have passedsince we turned our backsawayemployed pollutionand decayenforced corruptionand allowed this destructionto torment and fuela society that's selfish and cruela higher man holding the toolsto control a lowerbut people are people......The time has cometo take up this linefeed this rhymeand see each otheras pieces of a wholeevery souluniqueadding a Sacred Threadto this Tapestrythis Webeach is partnone forgottenthis Blanket was begottenat the start of it allevery jump and fallit's thereSo take careto rememberYou ARE Special!You have your own way to exista beautiful pattern insidenot just a double helixbut experienceYou're feeling thisSo, what's it like?Do you flee or fightfly a kitesing or bite?Show your Might!And dazzle those around youwith the incredible unknowable that is youAnd I will too,for my life is fatedby my own willthis is my soil to tillmy beat to fillCan you hear it?Listen carefully...and you will.If you search for Alia Rain Smith on youtube, I'll make sure I upload a video of that whole poem- my first 'epic' so you can hear the inflection, intonation and resonance of a grown-up earth-chylde who just wants to help maintain the ability -for those who would choose it- to live life simply, slowly, savoring the sweetness, giving patience and medicine to the tribulations. It's called 'So it Goes from no Easy Chair.'

Not only am I a member of WILPF, I
am on the board of a locally founded social justice group called Community
Action for Justice in the Americas, Asia and Africa (CAJA3), I am
part of two coalitions of organizations and individuals, both are working to educate and empower community action to protect the foundations of our ability to live healthfully and with true economic security and stability.
I help produce a program on our
local, independent college radio station, KBGA Missoula 89.9fm. It’s the Outer
Limits Radio Show and through it we create an audio montage, a scrapbook of
sound- interviews, newsreels, documentaries, expert voices; doing our best to cover a variety of global to local issues that are
often skewed or ignored by the ownership of mainstream media.
In the past few years I have been
facing the challenges and fears of my youth: low self-esteem, depression, stage
fright. I have traveled between Missoula MT and San Francisco CA sharing poetry
and hosting events that encourage everyone to be creative and share their arts! I want to continue this work and pursue deeper outreach to youth, to the homeless, to the imprisoned, and to the depressed.

 There's no need for cash- You can still help!
 

If you’re not able to contribute
monetarily, don’t sweat it! Believe me, I understand and honor you for taking
care of your own needs! If you do support this intention and continued vision
you can still help in a big way! 
Please share this campaign; if only
to people you know personally and with a personal message. Spread it far and
wide also if you choose, but a reflection from your own impression will add so
much more than a dollar could do!Look up and consider becoming a member of Women's International League for Peace and Freedom: http://www.wilpfinternational.org/The ICAN Campaign: http://www.icanw.org/ Learn about other parts of the world: India, China, Afghanistan, Syria, Iran, Serbia, Bosnia, Russia, Ukraine, etc- but seek insight and knowledge from independent sources, use the internet to find people from those places to connect with and learn from. Grow your awareness to perceive that within our own country there are a variety of contentious perspectives that completely contradict each other, yet claim to know beyond any doubt that what they believe about certain events, leaders, economic and militaristic pursuits are unquestionable truth. One thing I know for certain is that the statement I just made can be said from within any nation-state. There are no constants. The truth is amorphous. Learn and know thyself. Grow relationships you can trust within your own community and abroad. Change is coming and if we all participate from a foundation of peace, healing and revitalizing our innate creativity- there's something incredibly profound to be achieved.Thank you for your own Journey
through this world, may your actions be a nourishing as the drought-worn land drinking up
a long missed rain. Peace!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

In recognition of his generous donation and due to Burt receiving nothing in the way of grants or other funding to assist him in training and keeping these dogs, the CVFR has agreed to donate the sum of $2000 Canadian to Burt to help with expenses.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>How we started:</h3> <p>My name is Kelsey Lindell and I am the founder of Uphold Global.  I started Uphold Global as an act of desperation and love to help save children with disabilities from the large injustices they face in other countries.  The UN tells us that 520 million people with disabilities live in underdeveloped countries, and 80% of those will not see their fifth birthday.  This is largely due to the fact that children with disabilities are seen as cursed or demon possessed by their cultures. </p>
<p>I was born with a physical disability and I also lived and worked with these children for three years in South Africa.  Knowing this would be my fate had I not been born in Minneapolis, and that this is the reality the children that I love face--I started a non-profit organization to empower grassroots organizations to meet these children's needs through raising awareness in America. </p>
<p>By joining this movement, you will give a voice to the children that need it most. </p> </div> <div> <h3>You're not just helping us, you're helping them.</h3>
<div><br/></div> <p>In order to give substantial project grants to organizations that help these children, we need to raise mass awareness. With the $150,000 we raise we will:</p> <ul>
<li>Be able to function as an organization in America for the next 6 months, have a staff to put together awareness campaigns and rallies.</li>
<li>Create a short film awareness documentary showcasing what real families deal with in Africa as an awareness tool in America.</li>
<li>Fund a $30,000 project grant for the Hillsong Africa Foundation to use to expand their projects that work with children with special needs in partnership with other organizations.  </li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Why create a <i>movement?</i>
</h3> <p>Uphold Global is comprised of two corporate oversight boards and an office team that make everything happen.  This injustice is taking more lives than 5x the highest estimates the Holocaust took in it's entirety <i>every year.</i></p>
<p>We're creating a movement because we believe in everyone's ability to impact this issue, and end it.  We believe in you, and we want you on board. </p>
</div> <div> <h3>The road less traveled<span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">  </span>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>These aren’t just children that you
can give a basic education, some clean water, and a few meals and hope they
make it—they need all that and then some. These children need <i>special </i>education, various therapies,
mobility aids, their families need jobs, and they need a future. </p>
<p>No grassroots organization can do
it all, so we’ve developed a strategy that will finally get us from injustice
to justice by functioning as an umbrella organization for them all. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In America, it is more expensive to
have a child with special needs and when you take the financial challenges to
developing countries that financial burden is magnified.  These organizations are often under-resourced
because people in America don’t understand why it is so much more expensive to
help children with disabilities in under-developed countries than children
without.  This is where the awareness
piece is key.  </p>
<p>Through raising awareness
about this injustice we will raise funds to give to these organizations as
grants, we will educate other Americans on the necessity to fund organizations
that work with special needs children, and we will be able to pressurize large
organizations such as the UN, UNICEF and World Health Bank to stop talking about
this issue and start doing something.  </p>
<p>For the last ten years the statistics released from these organizations
have not changed—because people like you and I didn’t know to expect and push
for them to change. </p>

</div> <p><br/></p></div>","How we started: My name is Kelsey Lindell and I am the founder of Uphold Global.  I started Uphold Global as an act of desperation and love to help save children with disabilities from the large injustices they face in other countries.  The UN tells us that 520 million people with disabilities live in underdeveloped countries, and 80% of those will not see their fifth birthday.  This is largely due to the fact that children with disabilities are seen as cursed or demon possessed by their cultures. 
I was born with a physical disability and I also lived and worked with these children for three years in South Africa.  Knowing this would be my fate had I not been born in Minneapolis, and that this is the reality the children that I love face--I started a non-profit organization to empower grassroots organizations to meet these children's needs through raising awareness in America. 
By joining this movement, you will give a voice to the children that need it most.    You're not just helping us, you're helping them.
 In order to give substantial project grants to organizations that help these children, we need to raise mass awareness. With the $150,000 we raise we will: 
Be able to function as an organization in America for the next 6 months, have a staff to put together awareness campaigns and rallies.
Create a short film awareness documentary showcasing what real families deal with in Africa as an awareness tool in America.
Fund a $30,000 project grant for the Hillsong Africa Foundation to use to expand their projects that work with children with special needs in partnership with other organizations.   
  Why create a movement?
 Uphold Global is comprised of two corporate oversight boards and an office team that make everything happen.  This injustice is taking more lives than 5x the highest estimates the Holocaust took in it's entirety every year.
We're creating a movement because we believe in everyone's ability to impact this issue, and end it.  We believe in you, and we want you on board. 
  The road less traveled  


These aren’t just children that you
can give a basic education, some clean water, and a few meals and hope they
make it—they need all that and then some. These children need special education, various therapies,
mobility aids, their families need jobs, and they need a future. 
No grassroots organization can do
it all, so we’ve developed a strategy that will finally get us from injustice
to justice by functioning as an umbrella organization for them all. 


In America, it is more expensive to
have a child with special needs and when you take the financial challenges to
developing countries that financial burden is magnified.  These organizations are often under-resourced
because people in America don’t understand why it is so much more expensive to
help children with disabilities in under-developed countries than children
without.  This is where the awareness
piece is key.  
Through raising awareness
about this injustice we will raise funds to give to these organizations as
grants, we will educate other Americans on the necessity to fund organizations
that work with special needs children, and we will be able to pressurize large
organizations such as the UN, UNICEF and World Health Bank to stop talking about
this issue and start doing something.  
For the last ten years the statistics released from these organizations
have not changed—because people like you and I didn’t know to expect and push
for them to change. 
  Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:

We believe that providing life-changing opportunities through education, fair trade and self-sustainability is the key to create new economic and social opportunities. The women:Our work allows women with limited education and experience to become financially stable, foster positive social networks, care for their children and improve their quality of life. In India, we call them our ladies and in Kenya, they are mamas. They are family to us. They are mothers, daughters, sisters, and friends. They are housewives, refugees, women coming from domestic violence, divorce, acid attacks or limited education.The challenges:- Sustaining work opportunities and support for the women in the project;- Lack of work opportunities;- Limited access to artisan training and skills building;- Poor English skills;- Limited access to information on empowerment and self-reliance, such as financial independence, confidence development, the process of decision making, and self-motivation;- Limited access to community counseling support for women;- Finding safety and shelter for women and families facing abuse; STATISTICS INSIDE THE PROJECT: The solutions:- Creating more work opportunities for our women;- Introducing English classes in the Center;- Contracting artisan teachers to train women on new skills; industrial sewing machines, jewelry making, producing patterns;- Access to financial education and planning;- Counselling and mentoring sessions;- Legal advice;- Micro-entrepreneurship development;WHAT ARE WE GOING TO USE THE MONEY FOR:The vision:- Develop our women’s Support Center;- Open community English and basic stitching classes at the Center;- Provide access to counseling, legal advice, and mentorship for the women;- A space of shelter and protection for women and families affected by abuse; Introducing Experience Project TrêsAn initiative working with the local community and tourism sector, Project Três, will develop new work opportunities for the women in the project and beyond.  The women in our project will be trained to host traditional cooking and stitching classes. These experiences will include storytelling and building connections to locals and awareness of the impact of social issues. The experience allows tourists and guests to have an immersive understanding of the lifestyle and culture of the women, leaving with a stronger sense of connectedness to the women of Project Três, as partners rather than as beneficiaries.  Sustainable work opportunities The Project will offer classes to teach new skills to women, empowering them to access new work opportunities, in and outside of the organization. Classes will include functional English, a range of professional artisan training and textile waste management awareness.  Project Três believes in the principles of making an impact on the global challenges we face, we pledge always to work towards the 2030 UN sustainability goals. Out of the 17 goals, we tackle 8. We are actively committed to Goal 5: Gender Equality; Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities; Goal 12: Responsible Production Consumption.  REWARDS:Postcard Fernanda PeraltaPostcard Laressa Quaglia Postcard Priscila Araujo Poster Fernanda PeraltaPoster Laressa QuagliaPoster Priscila Araujo   SIZE T-SHIRTS - APPLIES TO ALL DESIGNS Measurements Guideline:Chest:S = 45,5 cmM = 47,0 cmL = 50,0 cmXL = 52,5 cmBottom:S = 47,0 cmM = 50,0 cmL = 52,0 cmXL = 55 cmLength:S = 67,0 cmM = 68,5 cmL = 69,5 cmXL = 71,5 cm MALE: Chest:S = 50 cmM = 55,0 cmL = 60,0 cmBottom:S = 47,5 cmM = 52,5 cmL = 57,5 cmLength:S = 74,6 cmM = 75,5 cmL = 77,0 cmMari Necklace: Available in 50 or 60 cm silver chainSANTA E NUVEM PIECES - SIZE BREAKDOWN BELOW THE PICTURE:U$ 72,00 Top Sizes:S - length: 42cmSleeves length: 53cmM - length: 43cmSleeves length: 54cm L - length: 44cmSleeves length: 55cm U$ 89,00 Shirt Sizes:S - length: 70 cm Chest: 54 cm Shoulders: 47 cm  M - length: 71 cmChest: 56; cm Shoulders: 49 cm  L - length: 72 cmChest: 58 cm Shoulders: 51 cm  Dress Sizes:S - Length: 93 cmSleeves: 20 cm Adjustable in the body. M - Length: 94 cmSleeves: 21 cmAdjustable in the body. L - Length: 95 cm Sleeves: 22 cm Adjustable in the body.EXCLUSIVE ARTWORK CAROLINA BÚZIOPRODUCTION + SHIPMENT GUIDELINE: DEUTSCHE VERSION: Unser Projekt:Project Três ist eine Initiative zur Stärkung und Förderung der wirtschaftlichen Unabhängigkeit von Frauen in Indien und Kenia.

If my DACA(pls google) application is approved before 30 days, I will more than likely be able to stay. I am not counting on it because I have been waiting for VERY many months already. If I do decide to muster up one last push ( cuz frankly I AM SO TIRED OF THIS DAMN FIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!), I have about 2 weeks to file all the forms.All in all, I have very little fight left in me... And still I am happy in my now and excited about my next now because I feel that maybe It will get better and maybe... just maybe... All this will work itself out and I can breathe.... TRULY breathe for the first time in 16 years...""
YetundeThe ImpactYetunde is like our own personal India.Arie in the community, spreading knowledge, joy, love with her creativity and art.  We want to allow our sister to keep spreading the love here in Atlanta, GA

<h3>Feed the Homeless</h3>
<p>This is the 25th time our team of volunteers will get together to feed the homeless. We will set up a portable kitchen in Oppenheimer park (better know as needle park) at 10:00 AM on June 24th 2012.</p>
<p>We are non paid, 100% volunteers and we give freely of our time to serve the community as we feed the approximately 2,300 homeless people</p>
<p>These people will be served a DECENT MEAL consisting of salad, real potatoes, fresh meat (steaks) and real vegetable (not canned stuff boiled beyond taste) with dinner rolls, coffee and tea and an actual dessert. The meal will be fresh cooked on site and served until the food runs out.</p>

<li>The more money we raise, the more people we can feed</li>
<li>There has always been a continuous line until the food runs out.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>

<h3>Mohammed's Story</h3>
<p>Mohammed was born in Iraq but ran away to Syria when he was a teenager when his parents discovered his sexual orientation.  Syria!  Living on the streets in Syria was difficult as he was often victimized by strangers, if not for the kindness of others he would not have made it.  When he was 17, he went to the UN office to get some help and they put him in contact with the Canadian Embassy who advocated for his relocation to Canada. </p>
<p>The Government approached us and we said we would sponsor him to come to Canada.  All of this commuication took place in the span of 48 hours.  Because we had the funds available to us and a prepared team we were able to jump into action.</p>
<p>Since he was a minor,  we found a family who would look after him until he became of major age.  Well five years later he is still living with that family and has graduated three years of high school (to perfect his English) and in currently in his second year of University in Toronto studying Political Science.  He is happy and in a wonderful same sex relationship with someone of his own age.</p>
<p>Had we not existed to take on this case who knows what have become of Mohammed in Syria.</p>
<p>His life has been changed for the better.</p>
<p>Remember the persecution you experienced when you were young, imagine that combined with a country that does not protect your basic human rights.</p>
<p><b>Why LGBT people around the world need us</b><br/></p>
<p>For every Mohammed there are a thousand LGBT refugees waiting for our help.  Each month we receive requests from dozens of people asking us to sponsor them to the LGBT safe haven called Canada.  As LGBT citizens we are blessed to be in such a progressive country. Each month 20 newcomers in Canada approach us to help them have a successful hearing at the Canadian Government Immigration and Refugee Board.</p>
<p>We are raising funds to continue our services to the LGBT refugees overseas and those LGBT people in Canada who have filed a refugee claim hoping to be successfully accepted to remain in Canada and not be sent back to the horrors of a life as and LGBT person in places like Jamaica, Russia or many countries in Africa including Nigeria and Uganda. </p>
<p>Since 2006 we have helped almost <b>1000</b> refugee claimants and sponsored <b>7</b> LGBT people from Iran, Iraq and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Most of these sponsorships happened in the past two years since we have been staffed to be most effective with these cases.</p>
<p>Our organization is the <b>only</b> LGBT Sponsorship Agreement Holder with an agreement in place with the Government of Canada sponsoring only LGBT refugees to safety. There are 88 Sponsorship Agreement Holders in Canada helping other communities - our focus is LGBT brothers and sisters and allies only.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Our thanks go out to you</h3>
<p>We need to keep one staff person employed to manage the variety of services we offer to the LGBT refugee claimants who come through our doors and those we sponsor to come to Canada from overseas.  </p>
<p>What you get from helping us is knowing that one more LGBT life has been saved from the horror that awaits them in their home country.  </p>
<p>You get to know that a new citizen will result from this and they will contribute to the mosaic that makes up this wonderful country we call home. </p>
<p>There are a variety of giving levels and all contributions are greatly appreciated. $10, $20, $100, $10,000 are all valuable to keep this program alive in 2015. </p>
<p>The most important perk you get from helping us is giving your heart to another person from a country where they will be hurt or killed if their sexual orientation were to become known.  There are almost 70 countries in the world where LGBT lives are at great risk - even death. </p>

<div><br/></div>
<div>Last year, the children's post-quake photos made it in the <i>New York Times </i><a href=""http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/behind-33/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Lens Blog"">Lens Blog</a> and the<i> Canadian Globe &amp; Mail</i>.<br/><br/>

<div>Please consider supporting this amazing project. 
All donations will make an big impact! </div>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It's an inspiring project that provides disadvantaged kids
 with media skills, pride, empowerment and most likely will be the 
highlight of their year. 
Some of these children still live in tents, eighteen months since the 
earthquake. These kids understand that photography gives them a voice to reach out to their own community and to the 
rest of the of the world, an opportunity 
to tell their own stories which will travel around the web and
to 
galleries in the United States. And they are also going to 
have some much needed fun! We're throwing a party for them in a 
beautiful gallery in Jacmel, Haiti with their pictures on the walls at the end of camp.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>Eight kids will be traveling from Cité Soleil to Jacmel to participate in the program. Six of these kids still need sponsorship for the program at $200 per child. These kids have not traveled for fun before, so this will be a unique and special experience for them. We also need to pay for transportation in Haiti for the children and volunteers, additional photography equipment, and supplies for the gallery show/art reception. <br/><br/>(My volunteer efforts are now fully funded, thanks to the generosity of friends and family!) <br/>

 project and a much needed-van to transport the 
children and volunteers to their assignments.  Please let them know your

either site! <br/><br/><p>Please help me spread the word via Facebook, Twitter, email, phone calls or carrier pigeon every day for the next 10 days!<br/></p>

have some much needed fun! We're throwing a party for them in a 
beautiful gallery in Jacmel, Haiti with their pictures on the walls at the end of camp.

What We NeedEight kids will be traveling from Cité Soleil to Jacmel to participate in the program. Six of these kids still need sponsorship for the program at $200 per child. These kids have not traveled for fun before, so this will be a unique and special experience for them. We also need to pay for transportation in Haiti for the children and volunteers, additional photography equipment, and supplies for the gallery show/art reception. (My volunteer efforts are now fully funded, thanks to the generosity of friends and family!) 

Other Ways You Can Help
Prefer to make a tax-deductible donation? Any money donated directly to zanmilakay.org
 is tax deductible and will also go directly to support supplies for the
 project and a much needed-van to transport the 
children and volunteers to their assignments.  Please let them know your 
donation is for the Photo Camp. I will be thrilled if you donate to 
either site! Please help me spread the word via Facebook, Twitter, email, phone calls or carrier pigeon every day for the next 10 days!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Human Rights over Gun Rights.</h3>
<p>Before Feb. 14, 2018 I had a witty pitch for this project. Now, I'm sobered by yet another school shooting. The GOP and NRA care more for what's INSIDE a uterus than for what comes out of it. They care more about precious guns than precious children and humans.</p>
<p>When I first did this campaign I raised money to have t-shirts made. 25% of the proceeds went to Planned Parenthood. The rest went into printing more shirts.  However, dealing with apparel was more complicated than I imagined. So many colors and sizes! I couldn't keep up the enthusiasm.  I stepped back and made stickers instead. But the message is more important NOW than ever! I want to get it out there again and in various formats. I want to add my design to the ubiquitous enamel pin world! As well as t-shirts, stickers and posters! </p>
<p>So, here's what I'm hoping for: $2500 to help me get these items made and out into the world.  Posters and enamel pins will be made, as well as stickers for bumpers and laptops. Of course, I'll have to dip into t-shirts again.  Once again 25% of the proceeds will go to Planned Parenthood. Now, I'd like to donate more of  the proceeds, with 12.5% to Sandyhookpromise.org and 12.5% to the ACLU. The remainder of the money will go back into production.</p>
<p>We aren't winning until these images are flipped and guns are more controlled more than vaginas. When Human Rights take precedence over gun rights.</p>

<h3>WHAT IS HYDRATE USA?</h3>
<p>Hydrate USA is a project started by 2 students from the Dallas area looking to hydrate the homeless and needy people in America, which is especially important during these extremely hot summer months.</p>
<h3>WHY WATER?</h3>
<p>It has been abnormally hot almost everywhere in the United States. Temperatures have been in the triple digits for weeks at a time. <br/><em>Imagine the homeless people in this heat.<br/></em> Many homeless &amp; needy men and women are living in this heat without cold, clean water. <br/>This is our exact mission: to help them survive by providing them with cold, clean bottled water. </p>
<p>After talking with many homeless men and women, like our good friend Chris (in the picture above), we have realized they do not have access to cold, clean water.</p>
<h3>WHERE ARE MY DONATIONS GOING TO?</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $5000. This will help provide bottled water, ice, and coolers to support our mission. We have provided around 800 bottles of water so far!<br/>We also are looking to become a non-profit organization. Your donations will help us fund the fees to becoming one so we can ensure the public that 100% of donations are going to our organization and NOTHING else. </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>If you can't provide a donation, we ask you to spread awareness. Word of mouth is a powerful tool. We greatly appreciate your support!<strong> <br/></strong></p>

On every occasion we organised a robust counter-demonstration and they eventually stopped coming (yay!). We have also organised numerous refugee solidarity events, taken aid to Calais, and worked on developing community involvement.

We can be more than just another American blog. Crossing Jordan is going to help carry the gift of the gospel to the nations - the Good News to the victims of sex-trafficking Cambodia.
The nations may be beyond the borders of our dreamy American life, but they are not beyond the reach of our God-sized dreams. For we preach the Gospel in word and deed if we spend ourselves for the sake of the Cross.

Will you help us raise $1000 for AIM?  An non-profit 501c.3 organization dedicated to prevent, rescue, restore, & equip victims of child sex-trafficking.
Will you declare with me and others: I AM {a very big part of} Crossing Jordan.  I am the hands and the feet that bring the Gospel to the nations.  I am the voice of the martyrs.  I am the parchment that the Good News is written upon.
Will you become part of the something the Crossing Jordan is doing to help others declare: I {Yes, I} am Crossing Jordan!

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<h3>Can an apartment become a real home?</h3>
<p>The walls of Pathways to Housing DC <span style=""background-color: initial;"">are decorated with locally-made artwork. When clients get their keys and prepare to move in to housing, they get to select homemade artworks they like from the walls to decorate their new living spaces. </span></p>
<p>One client we met as part of the tour told us his couch had been donated through a partnering organization. He spoke about the day the couch arrived, the size of the couch, its various merits.

<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why are the people who work at Pathways so awesome?</h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Good question. I don't know. But they are inspirational. </li>
<li>One guess: The team is DEDICATED. They talk about regular, frequent, constant, unrelenting visits they make to residents who are now in housing. Some of the daily problems clients face (lining up medical care, finding work, managing benefits) are incredibly hard to tackle—but just think how much harder they would be to solve on the street. Often, getting a person off the streets is just one step in a long recovery process.  </li>
<li>One staff member spoke about the joy he experienced in helping a woman re-unite with her adult daughters, repairing a long-strained relationship that was essential to the well-being of the entire family. He clearly gained personal satisfaction from doing this work and I think the clients he helps can tell. </li> </ul>
<p></p> <p> </p>
<h3>There are a lot of possible solutions to homelessness. Does Pathways to Housing DC really work? </h3> <ul>
<li>Yes. You can ask the 600 individuals who they have housed and helped recover in ten years. </li>
<li>Once housed, an individual receives comprehensive support and treatment services so that he or she can make their recovery long-lasting. </li>
<li>The housing-first model has consistently been shown to end and prevent chronic homelessness for 85-90% of individuals who have been traditionally seen as ""noncompliant,"" ""treatment resistant,"" and ""not ready for housing."" </li> </ul>

(Yes, I was worried about that. I've never raised money for anything before!) But the need is huge.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm Dennis, Vietnamese-Canadian and world traveler. During a visit to Cambodia during December 2011, my eyes couldn't help notice the vast amounts of young people selling goods, begging and being ""sold"".It brought tears to my eyes to see this kind of stuff since I have young nieces, nephews, cousins.. And to imagine them being sold, kidnapped or trafficked just makes me sad and upset. Upon my return to Canada, I connected with a great friend of mine, Lisa, which founded and works with human trafficking victims in Cambodia. Since that moment, I have been trying to raise funds for her organization ""Senhoa"" to support the projects and programs in Siem Reap and Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>What people don't realize is, Human Trafficking is a $32 billion industry, affecting 161 countries worldwide. These issues are in developed countries like USA, Canada, UK, Australia, etc.. I focused on SE Asia cause young people don't have the opportunities that we do in the Western World.. During my visit to Cambodia in 2011, kids were out trying to sell items to help feed their families. We're talking kids like 7-12 here. I remember when I was 7-12, I was attending school, I was out in the playground, playing with friends and not worrying about providing for my family. Well, they don't have the same opportunity...</p>
<p>Your donation will go to provide an opportunity to young people who might be sold by their families to survive.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Where are the funds going?</h3>
<p>Our fundraising efforts will include disbursing funds to Senhoa Foundation, a 501 (c)(3) organization according to the Internal Revenue Agency of the United States of America and other projects.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Get the word out</h3>
I'm not asking for much, just a small token of $5.00-$50.00 will go a long ways. $5.00 is merely missing out on Starbucks for one day. $50.00 might be a night out with friends. What you don't realize, $5.00 would buy a sack of rice for a family in Cambodia and I'm sure it will last a month. $50.00 would go to provided the opportunity for education and decent meals. So spread the word :)</div>

<p>Last summer I took a vow to be Trustworthy, Helpful, Friendly, Courteous, Kind, Obedient, Cheerful, Thrifty, Brave, Clean, and Reverent to my fellow Eagle Scout and now-husband, Steve.</p>
<p>For those of you who weren’t in Scouts, that’s the Scout Law. Although it has been more than a decade since I earned my Eagle Scout badge, I can still rattle it off from memory. Scouts imbued a set of skills and values that I rely on daily. It is frustrating that the Scouts are so shortsighted and narrow-minded. I would have never picked them to be on the wrong side of history. </p>
<p>That being said, there is hope. The Northern Star Council of the Boy Scouts of America, which is the council where I received my Eagle Scout, <a href=""http://jjust.in/mnscouts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">announced that they would buck the national BSA mandate and allow gay scouts and scoutmasters to remain in scouting.</a></p>
<p><strong>I believe that the Boy Scouts is an institition worth saving.</strong> For as frustrating as the National BSA's policy of discrimination is, at this point, anger isn't going to change it. Instead, our best hope is to effect change from within. Part of that means demonstrating that a policy of inclusion is a positive step that the larger community supports. </p>

That's why I'm offering to match pledges of support for the Northern Star Council (within the $1,000 goal).",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I'm a new mom and my baby was born in October. Recently my wife and I found out that, despite being able to list my partner (the non-birth mom) on the birth certificate, we would still have to shell out thousands of dollars to ensure my wife's legal parental rights.</p>
<p>In BC, if two women are married and one gets pregnant with an unknown donor, the other mom still needs to go through an adoption to get parental rights. Even when the biological father is unknown. Even when they've been married for years. Even when that non-recognized parent is the one that has helped the biological mom survive a brutal pregnancy, worked hard to prepare for the baby, and do everything that a legally recognized parent would do (and more!).</p>
<p>In Quebec, in these exact same circumnstances, rights are automatically given to the non-biological mom. So it is possible...BC just hasn't clued in yet.   It really is that f*cked up!</p>
<p>Under our current financial circumnstances, it will be nearly impossible for us to get the $$$ together on their own to go through the (what should be completely unneccessary) adoption process. All money raised will go directly towards the adoption and legal fees required to ensure both parents have legal parental rights.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>An estimate of what the adoption will cost is anywhere from $800-$2000. Any money we get over and above the required costs will be donated the Vancouver's Qmunity Center - a resource for LGBTQ people of all ages.</p>

B.S. degree in Sociology and have spent the last 6 months or so looking for jobs where I can utilize the tools and skills that came along with such degree.  I will be honest, originally the search area was limited to positions where I would have access to a decent amount of personal profit.  However, after having no luck, I have broadened not only my search, but also my moral compass.  After doing so, I realized that there has been a need for my attention and focus right here within my own neighborhood and community.</p><p>I will start at the beginning without going into more detail then needed, as to attempt to keep your attention and interest.  All my life I have been aware of this big brick building located nearly two miles down the road from my family home.  When I was a child my mother would take me along when she drove down there to drop off boxes of magazines and clothes.  However, I was completely unaware of and uninterested in why we routinely took old belongings to this building.  As time went on and as I got older, I began seeing random, unfamiliar individuals walking down my street, the adjacent road, and around the small mecca of convenient stores down the road from me, each with their own characteristic that defined them as someone less-fortunate (Don't get me wrong, I am by no means anywhere close to being wealthy, just lucky enough to be born into a middle-class home).  These individuals, although they did occasionally innocently block parts of the street, ask for spare change, request a ride during times of bad weather, and solicit simple products, never seemed to be harmful, dangerous, or a hindrance to anyone in the community.  That is, until one of my neighbors who had recently adopted a young child began complaining that someone was trespassing on her property late at night, knocking on her door, attempting to break into her home, and going through her mailbox.  One day it just seemed like she began trying to think of ways to talk negatively about the individuals who we all had come to find out lived in that big brick building down the road.  Unfortunately, some of the other community members who lived in close proximity to this neighbor of mine also began voicing their opinions, claiming that the individuals who walk down our road were a risk for causing vehicular accidents, becoming victims of crimes, and for becoming criminals.  This prompted community leaders and law enforcement personnel to get involved in the situation, leading to the creation of mass hysteria within my community, and to the implementation of regular community meetings held to discuss the cost vs. benefit of having this venue remain a part of the community.</p><p>Finally, after years of debates and quarrels, the decision was made to have this property shut down for good, forcing those who lived there to find other housing arrangements.  However, what wasn't taken into consideration as much as it should have been was the fact that the individuals who called the place home were, therefore by definition, significantly less-fortunate, as the venue itself was built and run to be a safe haven for residents of the surrounding communities who were impoverished, homeless, physically or mentally disabled, victims of domestic abuse, or who were former drug addicts seeking isolation from those who have a negative impact on them.</p><p>Another under-publicized piece of this whole situation was that, by shutting down this community support venue, those who did call the place home either temporarily, or for the foreseeable future at the time, were largely displaced, and left with even fewer resources than they had when they had arrived.  The effects of the decision that was made has left many of the individuals homeless, a portion of which remain in our community, living on the sides of the very road that, when they had walked down it, initiated the whole situation--proving that the way in which this situation was approached provided hardly any resolution for the community members who voiced their complaints at the start.</p><p>Now, you have heard the story from start to finish, and now may have some idea of what I am attempting to do with funds from this crowd-sourcing project.  For those of you that don't, what I am attempting to do is raise some capital so that I am able to have this housing source for those less-fortunate than many of us reopened.  Being that I have been a member of this community for 24 years, have been present to experience the rise and fall of the venue in question, and being that I have an understanding of what issues caused a rift in the past, I believe that I have a solid handle on what it will take to maintain such a place while ensuring that doing so doesn't cause any problems within the surrounding community.  </p><p>What I am asking from you is that you contribute what you can to assist me in this venture.  If you are able to do so, and you would like to be, you can be one of the first considered for one of the many jobs that will be created should be achieve the reopening of this venue.  There will be several openings for nursing staff, administrative staff, clerical employees, maintenance, housekeeping, and many others.  The structure I am seeking to open will be, like it has been in the past, a safe haven for any and all individuals who are currently facing hardship, are disabled, who are abuse victims, are homeless, are attempting sobriety, or who are in need of a place to stay on a temporary basis.  There will be an option for permanent and semi-permanent housing for residents who meet state and local guidelines and who meet any other necessary requirement.  Otherwise, confidentiality will be respected for those who are only seeking housing for a short temporary period--we will not require any information from them beyond the legally-required amount.  For now, it is my plan that we will function as a

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>I want to write an awesome, <b>blasphemous </b>book (around 500 
pages) about science, morals, critical thinking and god.<br/></p>By choosing one of the awesome 
perks, you can become a part of the book or pre-order it for only 2$. :-)<br/><br/><h1><b>About me:</b></h1><p>I'm Christian, a german who studied 
mathematics and physics. I'm an atheist, who loves the work of George 
Carlin, Christopher Hitchens, James Randi, Carl Sagan, Richard Dawkins, 
Bill Maher, Ricky Gervais and Jim Jefferies. My preferred (atheistic) 
YouTube-Channels include:<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/DarkMatter2525"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> DarkMatter2525</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/armouredskeptic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Armoured Skeptic</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/TheAtheistExperience"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TheAtheistExperience</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/JaclynGlenn"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">JaclynGlenn</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/Thunderf00t"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Thunderf00t</a>.<br/></p><p>I
 think, the world would be a much better place, if all the people, who 
at the moment follow religions, which condemn rational, sceptical and 
critical thinking, which condemn homosexuality and condoms, wants 
cartoonists or authors dead, or other stupid stuff, if all those people,
 would instead (or additionally) choose the human and civil rights as 
their guiding principle and adopt scientific thinking to detect frauds 
like homoeopathy or intelligent design.
</p><p>Imagine a book which tells those people that they were maliciously 
defrauded, that they should adopt the human rights as their guiding 
principle, that they should be sceptic about everything anyone tells 
them, how humans fool themselves and how to avoid this, what methods 
religions use to fool others into blindly following them and some 
counterarguments to their biggest lies. Think of it as a combination of 
the declaration of the human rights combined with scientific stuff like 
Steven Hawking's ""A brief history of time"" and Carl Sagan's ""The 
Demon-Haunted World"" (but not as exaggerated as it sounds).  So I 
thought, what if there was such a book? I thought, that would be 
useless, because logic does not win against religious beliefs. At least 
in most of the cases. And that's sad. :-(</p>
<h2>BUT</h2>
<p>But what if god himself comes to the world and tells those people, 
that they were maliciously deceived and they should follow and believe 
in human rights instead of the old books. If it is not just a book but ""<b>the updated bible</b>"",
 god himself, who tells them to behave in a good way. So all of the 
above but in a religious context. Who could argue against god, the 
creator of the universe?
</p><p>Then, every time someone says: ""But god prohibits homosexuality, it's
 in the bible.""  you can answer: ""Oh, you mean the old outdated bible. 
Haven't you heard that was a scam? Have you read the updated bible? God 
doesn't care about anyone's sex-life."" And if this person believes 
everything he reads, then the debate should be over and there would be 
one better person in the world. Or at least it might give them something
 to think about and maybe question the old beliefs.
</p>And then it really happened:<br/><br/><h1>This is what happened:</h1><p>God: Hey Christian</p><p>Me: ???</p>
<p>God: Hi Christian, it's me Jehovah. Some call me Yahweh or simply god.

</p><p>Me: What the f*** is going on?
</p><p>God: Okay, last try... Hi Christian.
</p><p>Me: Um, Hi *confused*
</p><p>God: I'm god
</p><p>Me: Hi god *insecure*</p><p>God: You don't believe me.
</p><p>Me: No, why should I? What's going on?
</p><p>God: I just noticed your planet for the first time. Some time 
ago, I created this universe and now I'm checking how the things are 
going. Nice to see what evolution did to your planet, but I think that 
some of your human fellows are a little bit crazy and need some 
adjusting of their common sense. 
</p><p>Me: What??? 
</p><p>God: Yeah, I don't like what I found here. I created the universe
 but had no part in the craziness which some attribute to me in their 
holy books. I want this corrected, you have to write an updated version.
</p><p>Me: Me? Why me?
</p><p>God: Someone has to do this and you seem to be good enough.
</p><p>Me: You know I'm an atheist.
</p><p>God: Yes, but that qualifies you especially for this task. You 
don't believe in the made up stories they wrote in the other holy books 
about me. I don't want to waste my time arguing with people who pretend 
to believe in me but will go nuts, if they find out that I'm not as 
described in their fairy tales. And you seem to be interested in science
 and human rights, I like this.</p><p>Me: And I was the best person you could think of?
</p><p>God: No, you are the 16th person I visit, but the other guys were
 too confused by me appearing to them. I don't like to waste time 
arguing with anyone, if its easier to find someone more ready to talk to
 me in a normal way. </p><p>Me: Okay, fair enough. But did you visit one of the popular atheists, like Dawkins? Wouldn't he be a more reasonable choice?</p><p>God:
 I will visit him, but I want the updated bible to be written by an 
ordinary guy who is not a famous atheist. It wouldn't feel right to me. 
Also, this way it's more convincing.</p><p>Me: Okay... but why do you want it updated?</p><p>God:
 I don't like the way I am portrayed in the other books. I'm not that 
crazy dictator like they pretend in the bible. I want to make that 
clear. And I don't like how you behave on this planet. I think you could
 and should do much better. The intelligent species on other planets 
fare much better by adopting critical thinking and morals which you 
would name human rights. I'm a really nice guy and just want to help 
you.</p><p>Me: So you want to establish a new religion? I don't like religions.</p><p>God:
 No, no, no. No new religion. I just want to tell you some things to 
help you. I don't care, if you believe in me or not. Why should I? You 
are just one of many populated planets in this universe and I just 
noticed your planet the first time. I just pity you, because you are not
 doing well at the moment. No, I really don't care if anyone believes in
 me and want nothing of this evangelizing rubbish, no missionary, no 
crusades, no jihads, no prayers. I also don't like the way priests 
behave and pretend they know anything about my wishes, thoughts or the 
way the world works. They know nothing. Some of this misguided souls 
have a great skill in manipulating others and give self-confident talks.
 But confident talks, no matter how well presented, don't change the 
reality.</p><p>I'm not the way the christians portray me. They 
portray me as an insecure crazy dictator. No self-confident god would 
behave like the freak in their books requesting this worshipping all the
 time, all this monitoring everyone's thoughts. No, that's nonsense. As 
if I didn't have anything better to do. No, I just want to tell those 
guys the truth who want to hear it. You can't help those, who rather 
like to live their lives in their fairy-tale-stories instead of the real
 world.
</p><p>Me: So, no missionizing? You seem like a nice guy!</p><p>God: I told you.
</p><p>Me: Okay, hmm. So, you really are god the almighty who created everything?
</p><p>God: No, I'm god. I just created the universe. You don't have to be almighty to create the universe.
</p><p>Me: You don't?
</p><p>God: No, you just have to start it. Your physicist call it big 
bang at the moment and that was no big deal. Everything else is done by 
physics and evolution. It's brilliant, isn't it?
</p><p>Me: So you just started the big bang and then did nothing else?
</p><p>God: Yes, it was easier that way. I don't like to do unnecessary 
work. It makes life so much easier. If you are clever you don't have to 
work hard. And even if I would have created everything by scratch, it's 
illogical to attribute omnipotence or any other skill to me, just 
because you think I did this one feat.</p><p>Me: So did you then create physics and evolution?
</p><p>God: *Laughing* No, you can't create evolution. It's just there. 
It's normal that organisms vary when they reproduce, especially with 
this DNA stuff which evolved here. Of the new organisms some are larger,
 some smaller, some have mutations which somehow help them, some have 
mutations which don't help. Evolution just means, that those which fit 
the surrounding the best will survive. It's nothing surprising, if you 
know this. Given enough time even the species change. And look at the 
brilliant outcome, how many species and plants you have just on this 
planet. Some brilliant, some beautiful, some really exciting. And again,
 imagine how exhausting it would have been to design all these things 
individually. How much time I would have wasted. And to come up with all
 those ideas. And then watching so many species go extinct again? No. 
Not mentioning all the other planets.</p><p>Me: So you used evolution to create everything?</p><p>God:
 You know, I'm not stupid. Only an idiot would have created everything 
from scratch. I used evolution, yes, but I had no idea of what would 
come out of it. That's how evolution works. Some people think that I 
designed everything. It's rather insulting to think, that I would not 
have been able to do better than you. You just have to take a look at 
all the diseases and mortality rates to see, that you are not well 
designed. Every part of you could easily be improved. No I didn't really
 create everything, I just started it.</p><p>Me: Did you create the laws of physics then?
</p><p>God: No, they were there before. They are the same laws of 
physics as in the place where I am from. I really just had to start the 
big bang.
</p><p>Me: Brilliant.</p><p>God: Thanks.</p><p>Me: So, are you all knowing?</p><p>God:
 Oh, that depends on how you see it. If I focus on something, I can know
 everything I want to know about it. At least everything which happened 
until now. The future is not so easy. It's easy to predict the future to
 a certain degree, but you can't be certain about everything, even if 
you know everything in the present. Then there is always the uncertainty
 principle combined with chaos theory which makes predicting the future 
really hard. Unless you use quantum theory, but mo....</p><p>Me: Yeah, I know what you mean, I studied physics. </p><p>God: Sorry, I forgot.</p><p>Me: You did?</p><p>God: No, just kidding.</p><p>Me: So, if you don't care about worshipping, what do you think of prayers?</p><p>God:
 Oh, they are nice for some people to focus their minds and make 
decisions. As long as they don't bother others with their prayers or 
expect me to take responsibility for something, there is nothing bad 
about it.</p><p>Me: But aren't most people asking you something in their prayers?</p><p>God:
 Yes, but that's just another way for them to focus their mind. I don't 
listen to prayers. Sometimes the things for which they pray happen, 
sometimes they don't. If the things happen, they obviously didn't have 
to be done by me. Some things happen, some things don't. It has nothing 
to do with me and their prayers. If two sport teams have a match and the
 fans of both teams pray for me, one team still has to win, even if I 
wouldn't exist, even if no one had prayed. If they think their team won 
because of me, they are not the brightest. Sometimes something very 
unlikely happens after a prayer, like winning in a lottery, yes. But 
obviously, unlikely thinks have to happen if you try often enough or 
wait for a long time. And even if something happens on the first try: as
 long as the probability isn't zero, there is nothing surprising, if it 
happens. If you think it's unbelievable, you just don't understand 
probability theory and should go back to school. Besides, I told you, 
that this is the first time I pay attention to your planet and I don't 
intent to pay much more attention in the future. Even if I would care 
about prayers, I couldn't pay attention to prayers on every planet and 
every species. So I think it's more fair, if I don't interfere at all.</p><p>Me: So you wouldn't interfere, even if something really bad is about to happen? That wouldn't be nice.</p><p>God:
 No, probably not. But I rarely interfere unless I see so much stupidity
 as in your present religions. And then I just give general help and do 
not focus on singular events. It's more fair this way and creates a good
 environment for responsibility, as a person, family, group, nation, 
species or as a whole planet.  Another thing: I also dislike the 
arrogance of the praying people. You can't know this: there are people, 
behaving really awful in general but want me to fix their unimportant 
little problems. They think, just because I created the universe, I'm 
responsible for everything, and they have a right to request some action
 of me. Isn't this arrogant? I found this behaviour in some other 
intelligent species on other planets, but the religions on your planet 
are really unique in their arrogance. Furthermore, it gives me more time
 for myself, if I don't care about everything going on in this universe.</p><p>Me: What do you do in your spare time?</p><p>God: That's none of your concern.</p><p>Me: Are there other gods like you?</p><p>God: None of your concern.</p><p>Me: So you won't tell anything about your world?</p><p>God: No.</p><p>Me: What a pity.</p><p>God: Sorry, my universe, my rules.</p><p>Me: Okay, good point, god. So what shall I do now?</p><p>God:
 You will write a book. We begin with the beginning, how I started the 
big bang and everything came into being by the laws of physics and 
evolution. I will go into some details of evolution because it is so 
easy and beautiful and some misguided guys think it is wrong.</p><p>Then there will be a huge section about morals.</p><p>Me:
 Hold on, I've got a question. Some religious people think, that there 
is a life after death, and you put everyone into heaven who is baptised 
and believes and worships you and everyone into hell who doesn't. So one
 can be a total assh*le all their life, like Hitler, a child raping 
priests or a religious terrorist who lusts for some virgins, and gets to
 heaven while you will send unbaptised babies to hell who never did any 
harm. What do you think about this?</p><p>God: We will cover this, 
yes. But if you are impatient. No rapist priest will go to heaven, no 
matter how hard he prays. Also, no one who kills anyone or orders anyone
 dead in my name, will get any virgins in paradise. The virgin thing was
 invented to manipulate gullible people. It's really sad how many people
 fall for these lies. So yes, this will be covered in the morals 
section.</p><p>Then there has to be a logic and reasoning section. There
 are so many ways to make bad arguments. It's crazy what so many people 
believe and how they get their ideas. This logic section will also 
contain a part where we look at ways to fool yourself and how to avoid 
this, why you need double blind studies and why it's good, to abandon 
believes which turn out to be wrong. Such things.</p><p>Me: Sounds like a great section!</p><p>God:
 Yes. Then there will also be a ""religious fraud""-section, where I will 
dismantle some of the claims of the big religions and how they managed 
to fool so many people. Finally, there will be a Q&amp;A section where I
 will answer some questions which won't fit into on of the above 
sections.
</p><p>Me: Sounds like a great book. When do we start writing?</p><p>God: 
Before you start this book, you should raise some awareness and some 
money by using a crowdfunding platform. If your campaign is finished, I 
will come back and we will write this book. Any more questions?</p><p>Me:
 I've got one further question which is on my mind for quite some time. 
Could you tell me, if there are religious leaders who don't believe in 
the god they represent?</p><p>God: Most don't.</p><p>Me: Most don't believe in their god?</p><p>God:
 No, some pretend to believe but in their hearts they know, that most of
 what they pretend to believe in, is not real. If you pay attention to 
their behaviour, it's not hard to spot. </p><p>Me: Interesting thoughts. Thank you.</p><p>God: You're welcome. And now, start the campaign.</p><h2>Are you serious?</h2><p>I know this sounds incredible, but if you are honest, not as incredible as the outdated bible.</p><p>If you think this is made up, you are wrong but can nevertheless 
support this book as a great work of satirical blasphemy and scientific 
humanism (but it's the true word of god, even if you don't believe it). 
Some might compare this to the flying spaghetti monster, but while the 
FSM is just satire and makes fun about religions, this is serious, true 
and supported by god.</p><p>Don't forget: If you don't support this campaign, you make god really sad. :'(</p><p>God: No, they won't! I don't care this much.</p><p>Me: I just thought this might help.</p><p>God: No, no lies!</p><p>Okay... god won't be sad, but you can still support this campaign. :-)</p></div>","I want to write an awesome, blasphemous book (around 500 
pages) about science, morals, critical thinking and god.By choosing one of the awesome 
perks, you can become a part of the book or pre-order it for only 2$. :-)About me:I'm Christian, a german who studied 
mathematics and physics. I'm an atheist, who loves the work of George 
Carlin, Christopher Hitchens, James Randi, Carl Sagan, Richard Dawkins, 
Bill Maher, Ricky Gervais and Jim Jefferies. My preferred (atheistic) 
YouTube-Channels include: DarkMatter2525, Armoured Skeptic, TheAtheistExperience, JaclynGlenn and Thunderf00t.I
 think, the world would be a much better place, if all the people, who 
at the moment follow religions, which condemn rational, sceptical and 
critical thinking, which condemn homosexuality and condoms, wants 
cartoonists or authors dead, or other stupid stuff, if all those people,
 would instead (or additionally) choose the human and civil rights as 
their guiding principle and adopt scientific thinking to detect frauds 
like homoeopathy or intelligent design.
Imagine a book which tells those people that they were maliciously 
defrauded, that they should adopt the human rights as their guiding 
principle, that they should be sceptic about everything anyone tells 
them, how humans fool themselves and how to avoid this, what methods 
religions use to fool others into blindly following them and some 
counterarguments to their biggest lies. Think of it as a combination of 
the declaration of the human rights combined with scientific stuff like 
Steven Hawking's ""A brief history of time"" and Carl Sagan's ""The 
Demon-Haunted World"" (but not as exaggerated as it sounds).  So I 
thought, what if there was such a book? I thought, that would be 
useless, because logic does not win against religious beliefs. At least 
in most of the cases. And that's sad. :-(
BUT
But what if god himself comes to the world and tells those people, 
that they were maliciously deceived and they should follow and believe 
in human rights instead of the old books. If it is not just a book but ""the updated bible"",
 god himself, who tells them to behave in a good way. So all of the 
above but in a religious context. Who could argue against god, the 
creator of the universe?
Then, every time someone says: ""But god prohibits homosexuality, it's
 in the bible.""  you can answer: ""Oh, you mean the old outdated bible. 
Haven't you heard that was a scam? Have you read the updated bible? God 
doesn't care about anyone's sex-life."" And if this person believes 
everything he reads, then the debate should be over and there would be 
one better person in the world. Or at least it might give them something
 to think about and maybe question the old beliefs.
And then it really happened:This is what happened:God: Hey ChristianMe: ???
God: Hi Christian, it's me Jehovah. Some call me Yahweh or simply god.

Me: What the f*** is going on?
God: Okay, last try... Hi Christian.
Me: Um, Hi *confused*
God: I'm god
Me: Hi god *insecure*God: You don't believe me.
Me: No, why should I? What's going on?
God: I just noticed your planet for the first time. Some time 
ago, I created this universe and now I'm checking how the things are 
going. Nice to see what evolution did to your planet, but I think that 
some of your human fellows are a little bit crazy and need some 
adjusting of their common sense. 
Me: What??? 
God: Yeah, I don't like what I found here. I created the universe
 but had no part in the craziness which some attribute to me in their 
holy books. I want this corrected, you have to write an updated version.
Me: Me? Why me?
God: Someone has to do this and you seem to be good enough.
Me: You know I'm an atheist.
God: Yes, but that qualifies you especially for this task. You 
don't believe in the made up stories they wrote in the other holy books 
about me. I don't want to waste my time arguing with people who pretend 
to believe in me but will go nuts, if they find out that I'm not as 
described in their fairy tales. And you seem to be interested in science
 and human rights, I like this.Me: And I was the best person you could think of?
God: No, you are the 16th person I visit, but the other guys were
 too confused by me appearing to them. I don't like to waste time 
arguing with anyone, if its easier to find someone more ready to talk to
 me in a normal way. Me: Okay, fair enough. But did you visit one of the popular atheists, like Dawkins? Wouldn't he be a more reasonable choice?God:
 I will visit him, but I want the updated bible to be written by an 
ordinary guy who is not a famous atheist. It wouldn't feel right to me. 
Also, this way it's more convincing.Me: Okay... but why do you want it updated?God:
 I don't like the way I am portrayed in the other books. I'm not that 
crazy dictator like they pretend in the bible. I want to make that 
clear. And I don't like how you behave on this planet. I think you could
 and should do much better. The intelligent species on other planets 
fare much better by adopting critical thinking and morals which you 
would name human rights. I'm a really nice guy and just want to help 
you.Me: So you want to establish a new religion? I don't like religions.God:
 No, no, no. No new religion. I just want to tell you some things to 
help you. I don't care, if you believe in me or not. Why should I? You 
are just one of many populated planets in this universe and I just 
noticed your planet the first time. I just pity you, because you are not
 doing well at the moment. No, I really don't care if anyone believes in
 me and want nothing of this evangelizing rubbish, no missionary, no 
crusades, no jihads, no prayers. I also don't like the way priests 
behave and pretend they know anything about my wishes, thoughts or the 
way the world works. They know nothing. Some of this misguided souls 
have a great skill in manipulating others and give self-confident talks.
 But confident talks, no matter how well presented, don't change the 
reality.I'm not the way the christians portray me. They 
portray me as an insecure crazy dictator. No self-confident god would 
behave like the freak in their books requesting this worshipping all the
 time, all this monitoring everyone's thoughts. No, that's nonsense. As 
if I didn't have anything better to do. No, I just want to tell those 
guys the truth who want to hear it. You can't help those, who rather 
like to live their lives in their fairy-tale-stories instead of the real
 world.
Me: So, no missionizing? You seem like a nice guy!God: I told you.
Me: Okay, hmm. So, you really are god the almighty who created everything?
God: No, I'm god. I just created the universe. You don't have to be almighty to create the universe.
Me: You don't?
God: No, you just have to start it. Your physicist call it big 
bang at the moment and that was no big deal. Everything else is done by 
physics and evolution. It's brilliant, isn't it?
Me: So you just started the big bang and then did nothing else?
God: Yes, it was easier that way. I don't like to do unnecessary 
work. It makes life so much easier. If you are clever you don't have to 
work hard. And even if I would have created everything by scratch, it's 
illogical to attribute omnipotence or any other skill to me, just 
because you think I did this one feat.Me: So did you then create physics and evolution?
God: *Laughing* No, you can't create evolution. It's just there. 
It's normal that organisms vary when they reproduce, especially with 
this DNA stuff which evolved here. Of the new organisms some are larger,
 some smaller, some have mutations which somehow help them, some have 
mutations which don't help. Evolution just means, that those which fit 
the surrounding the best will survive. It's nothing surprising, if you 
know this. Given enough time even the species change. And look at the 
brilliant outcome, how many species and plants you have just on this 
planet. Some brilliant, some beautiful, some really exciting. And again,
 imagine how exhausting it would have been to design all these things 
individually. How much time I would have wasted. And to come up with all
 those ideas. And then watching so many species go extinct again? No. 
Not mentioning all the other planets.Me: So you used evolution to create everything?God:
 You know, I'm not stupid. Only an idiot would have created everything 
from scratch. I used evolution, yes, but I had no idea of what would 
come out of it. That's how evolution works. Some people think that I 
designed everything. It's rather insulting to think, that I would not 
have been able to do better than you. You just have to take a look at 
all the diseases and mortality rates to see, that you are not well 
designed. Every part of you could easily be improved. No I didn't really
 create everything, I just started it.Me: Did you create the laws of physics then?
God: No, they were there before. They are the same laws of 
physics as in the place where I am from. I really just had to start the 
big bang.
Me: Brilliant.God: Thanks.Me: So, are you all knowing?God:
 Oh, that depends on how you see it. If I focus on something, I can know
 everything I want to know about it. At least everything which happened 
until now. The future is not so easy. It's easy to predict the future to
 a certain degree, but you can't be certain about everything, even if 
you know everything in the present. Then there is always the uncertainty
 principle combined with chaos theory which makes predicting the future 
really hard. Unless you use quantum theory, but mo....Me: Yeah, I know what you mean, I studied physics. God: Sorry, I forgot.Me: You did?God: No, just kidding.Me: So, if you don't care about worshipping, what do you think of prayers?God:
 Oh, they are nice for some people to focus their minds and make 
decisions. As long as they don't bother others with their prayers or 
expect me to take responsibility for something, there is nothing bad 
about it.Me: But aren't most people asking you something in their prayers?God:
 Yes, but that's just another way for them to focus their mind. I don't 
listen to prayers. Sometimes the things for which they pray happen, 
sometimes they don't. If the things happen, they obviously didn't have 
to be done by me. Some things happen, some things don't. It has nothing 
to do with me and their prayers. If two sport teams have a match and the
 fans of both teams pray for me, one team still has to win, even if I 
wouldn't exist, even if no one had prayed. If they think their team won 
because of me, they are not the brightest. Sometimes something very 
unlikely happens after a prayer, like winning in a lottery, yes. But 
obviously, unlikely thinks have to happen if you try often enough or 
wait for a long time. And even if something happens on the first try: as
 long as the probability isn't zero, there is nothing surprising, if it 
happens. If you think it's unbelievable, you just don't understand 
probability theory and should go back to school. Besides, I told you, 
that this is the first time I pay attention to your planet and I don't 
intent to pay much more attention in the future. Even if I would care 
about prayers, I couldn't pay attention to prayers on every planet and 
every species. So I think it's more fair, if I don't interfere at all.Me: So you wouldn't interfere, even if something really bad is about to happen? That wouldn't be nice.God:
 No, probably not. But I rarely interfere unless I see so much stupidity
 as in your present religions. And then I just give general help and do 
not focus on singular events. It's more fair this way and creates a good
 environment for responsibility, as a person, family, group, nation, 
species or as a whole planet.  Another thing: I also dislike the 
arrogance of the praying people. You can't know this: there are people, 
behaving really awful in general but want me to fix their unimportant 
little problems. They think, just because I created the universe, I'm 
responsible for everything, and they have a right to request some action
 of me. Isn't this arrogant? I found this behaviour in some other 
intelligent species on other planets, but the religions on your planet 
are really unique in their arrogance. Furthermore, it gives me more time
 for myself, if I don't care about everything going on in this universe.Me: What do you do in your spare time?God: That's none of your concern.Me: Are there other gods like you?God: None of your concern.Me: So you won't tell anything about your world?God: No.Me: What a pity.God: Sorry, my universe, my rules.Me: Okay, good point, god. So what shall I do now?God:
 You will write a book. We begin with the beginning, how I started the 
big bang and everything came into being by the laws of physics and

easy and beautiful and some misguided guys think it is wrong.Then there will be a huge section about morals.Me:

 WE need your help NOW, more Than EVER time is running out we have a month to go  we need  300 000 Dollars to save the Peace
House. Help us Buy the Peace House, Help us continue our Work, and help us to save a Piece of History for the Future.
 Our vision as the Peace House is to be a vehicle to transform individual lives and communities for those working for positive social change and a world free from oppression. We foster learning and activist excellence through the People’s Library and Research Center. Which assists and/or facilitates various individual, community, and world betterment projects. Such as Teach-Ins, Non-Violence Training's and Direct action tactics for social change. Which is an ideal means for creative expression to break the cycle of the philosophical, political and moral doctrine of the system that was designed.
Our work as grassroots Peace house Team is :
 - create educational events for Activists and our Community 
- provide certain resources for activists and our community
- give free art/media classes 
- work to establish and continue on our Free School Project
- strengthen efforts of other organizations
- outreach 
Where Did the Idea of the Peace House come From ? 
 William Thomas also helped establish the Peace House in the Year 2000, along side with his Wife Ellen. 
In 1981 William Thomas, started the longest running Peace Vigil in at least the United States.  The focus has always been anti-nuclear war, though it has grown over the years to include all threats and atrocities to peace everywhere.  Regardless of weather, harassment, frustration and legal issues, the vigil has gone on, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, right across from the White House,in a small little white Tent. The Peace Vigil was kept alive with the help of Conception Picciotto, who has been part of the Vigil from the very first beginning. 
When did we Get involved and why ?
A Group of Community Organizers, Student Activists, Occupy Activists, Visionaries and Dreamers, moved into the Peace House to follow the steps of William Thomas's ""Wisdom and Honesty"", to keep the history alive, to prevent this historical place from being sold to those who would not be able to appreciate it, and most importantly to create something we like to see as ""the People's embassy"".
What Does the Peace House do ?
 For almost a Year now, we have established a small Library and Research corner, to educate ourselves, and our activist community.
It has become a save Hub, to Rest, to meet like-minded others, and to work on projects together.
Through Regular Open Media Nights, we have presented documentaries regarding serious issues, followed by a discussion facilitated by a ""guest speaker"". We helped those who asked us to help them, with their events/rallies, such as the ""womens march"", ""trevon martin"" and ""carlos slim"", in form of outreach, speaker or microphones, Bullhorns, designing fliers and posters, and or by sending out our comrades in Solidarity.
Our Artists have invested Time to teach our Community, Street Art throughout our Free Art Teach-in's. 
 Our Educational Events, such as our ""kick off Event against Mass Incarceration, or the Prison Industrial Complex"", ""Tuesday nights cafes for peace in the Middle east"", opened up Conversation and Understanding.
 Our Peace House, Occupy Sandy Dc Solidarity Team, has invested time and effort to establish a support Group for those injured and in pain, in New York and New Jersey.
 Love Music Hate Racism US chapter, was established in the Peace House, after being run very successfully for over 10 Years in England and Ireland.
Under the Umbrella of Love Music Hate Racism we enjoyed Nights of Poetry, Music and Storytelling, and formed a Voice for the Voiceless. Together through magical and beautiful means, we addressed issues such as Hate, Racism, Sexism, Homophobia.
 We continue to work with our Divers Group of Peace House Members to full fill our mission.
 Our Sisters and Brothers from ""the People's Media Center"", are now working with the Peace House Team, by establishing Teach-in's, and setting up their coming up ""web-casting studio"" in to the Peace House.
 These are the reasons, only view to be mentioned by we continue to  fight to save the peace house, help us raise $300 000 dollars towards the purchase Price, your donations are Tax-deductible, to donate towards the needed $300 000 please go to our website www.occupypeacehouse.org and click the donate button !

<p>We promote a feminist approach in three ways: through the riders who participate; the personality of the items donated to the library; and the use of bicycles.

We're lucky to have his expertise and generosity!<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>The more we raise, the more exciting a bookcycle we can build:</p>
<p>With $2000 we can have a basic model, starting from a simple tricycle fitted with a special cargo box in the rear.

<p>With $4000, not only will we build our first bookcycle, but we'll also be able to make significant additional purchases of books from our wishlist; gather materials for special programming like children's craft-book-bike events; secure storage space for the collection; cover our operational expenses; offer fun and friendly outings to our volunteers, and so on. </p>

<p>With $10,000 (or more) we can build more than one bike, perhaps a small team, or one truly giant, aesthetically elaborate but structurally sound, bookmobile. Our timeline with resources like that would expand over a year or so, but we like to think big!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Kitchen Bees program is an Outreach Project of The Church of the Apostles in Guelph, Ontario. We bring in volunteers every Tuesday and Thursday to come and make meals for the community in need. As a program, we provide a recipe and all of the ingredients required - our volunteers are only required to make/bake/cook them.</p>
<p>There has been an expected but extremely unfortunate rise in members using services like ours within the community as job loss and illness has taken a toll on many individuals and families. Many programs have been forced to shut down or heavily cut back on workers/facilities, leaving many vulnerable members of our community left without resources they rely on. Food insecurity is extremely taxing on one's mental health, and as covid-19 continues to affect our province - it is becoming much more prevalent in communities like Guelph, with little indication of it stopping any time soon. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How Can You Help?</h3>
<p>The Kitchen Bees relies solely on grants and community donations in order to keep the program running. As of right now, we believe we have enough funding to help get us through the summer - however we have a goal to keep the program alive until the end of the year! Since we are reliant on volunteers and donations - we are consistently looking for generous supporters who believe in our mission. Donations will go towards purchasing ingredients and supplies required to keep the program running! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We began our program back in April 2020 - right as the first shutdown began. Since starting - we have made over 4500 meals - and so far have made 750+ meals in 2021 alone. We are on track to be making around 125 meals a week including sandwiches, frozen soups, and hot meals. The bench receives the majority of our fresh food, while frozen pre-made meals go directly to organizations like Hope House, GNSC, and Royal City Mission. We take pride in the quality of food that we make - providing hungry members of our community with hearty meals made with fresh produce + a variety of fresh meat products.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help! We require volunteers every Tuesday and Thursday to put their hands to good work and make some yummy meals for the community! If you have any interest in volunteering your time, please email <strong>kitchenbees@apostlesguelph.org </strong>with the subject line '<strong>KITCHEN BEES VOLUNTEERING</strong>'</p>

We began our program back in April 2020 - right as the first shutdown began. Since starting - we have made over 4500 meals - and so far have made 750+ meals in 2021 alone. We are on track to be making around 125 meals a week including sandwiches, frozen soups, and hot meals. The bench receives the majority of our fresh food, while frozen pre-made meals go directly to organizations like Hope House, GNSC, and Royal City Mission. We take pride in the quality of food that we make - providing hungry members of our community with hearty meals made with fresh produce + a variety of fresh meat products.

Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help! We require volunteers every Tuesday and Thursday to put their hands to good work and make some yummy meals for the community! If you have any interest in volunteering your time, please email kitchenbees@apostlesguelph.org with the subject line 'KITCHEN BEES VOLUNTEERING'

Today - Vladimir Putin gets to decide who is a Human Being in Russia.
President Obama said on Leno,  “I’m surprised this is not a huge story. Suddenly, homosexuality is against the law. I mean, this seems like Germany: let’s round up the Jews; let’s round up the gays; let’s round up the blacks. I mean, it starts with that ...  Why is not more of the world outraged at this?” 
We have designed your outrage vehicle, the Putin Games™ .



Why? Simple.       Gay Rights ... LGBT Rights .... are Human Rights.

We have designed a great strategy to disseminate your message.
These coming 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia need an Asterisk...

A Rainbow Snowflake™ .
Every snowflake to fall to earth since the beginning of time is unique ...just as every person who was ever born.



The Putin Games™  Asterisk for Olympic uniforms, Hat, Shirts and Shoes. 
We want this Rainbow Snowflake™  on everything ... all over Everywhere  __________________________________________________________________

Here is what Putin's Article 6.21 actually says:
Propaganda is the act of distributing information among minors that 1) is aimed at the creating nontraditional sexual attitudes, 2) makes nontraditional sexual relations attractive, 3) equates the social value of traditional and nontraditional sexual relations, or 4) creates an interest in nontraditional sexual relations. 
If you’re Russian. Individuals engaging in such propaganda can be fined 4,000 to 5,000 rubles (120-150 USD), public officials are subject to fines of 40,000 to 50,000 rubles (1,200-1,500 USD), and registered organizations can be either fined (800,000-1,000,000 rubles or 24,000-30,000 USD) or sanctioned to stop operations for 90 days. If you engage in the said propaganda in the media or on the internet, the sliding scale of fines shifts: for individuals, 50,000 to 100,000 rubles; for public officials, 100,000 to 200,000 rubles, and for organizations, from one million rubles or a 90-day suspension.
If you’re an Alien. Foreign citizens or stateless persons engaging in propaganda are subject to a fine of 4,000 to 5,000 rubles, or they can be deported from the Russian Federation and/or serve 15 days in jail. If a foreigner uses the media or the internet to engage in propaganda, the fines increase to 50,000-100,000 rubles or a 15-day detention with subsequent deportation from Russia.

So you too can participate, just fly our RAINBOW SNOWFLAKE in Russia and you can enjoy 15 days of R&R in prison and you may get some snappy-lookin' prison garb by    Olympic sponsor Adidas.

<p>The WASH project around the Kahangi village, which is located on borders of Kibale Forest National park on the outskirts of Fort Portal, Uganda, face very serious challenges including extreme poverty, malnutrition, limited educational opportunities and disease such as HIV/AIDS and Bilharzias (contracted from contaminated water). The goal is to be able to access sustainable clean water for their home use. The main traditional sources of water in this part of rural Uganda are small ponds and unprotected wells, both of which are easily polluted, causing disease and ill-health. Unsafe sanitation practices and the spread of preventable diseases are a large part of Uganda water crisis.</p>

<p>This is a rare opportunity for both me and others, as the funding will go directly towards creating clean drinking water wells. Too many charities take advantage of the good will of others. As I will personally be working directly on the well, I can guarantee that the money raised here will go to a good cause. It takes over $2,000 US to make one well. If more is genereated, the remaining funds will be used to better enrich the community. In the past, the extra funds have been used as educational resources, or planting fruit trees so children and villagers would be able to have more than one meal a day. I really hope you consider giving, even a small donation will make a big difference. This is something I beleive we all can get behind.</p>
</div></div>","The WASH project around the Kahangi village, which is located on borders of Kibale Forest National park on the outskirts of Fort Portal, Uganda, face very serious challenges including extreme poverty, malnutrition, limited educational opportunities and disease such as HIV/AIDS and Bilharzias (contracted from contaminated water). The goal is to be able to access sustainable clean water for their home use. The main traditional sources of water in this part of rural Uganda are small ponds and unprotected wells, both of which are easily polluted, causing disease and ill-health. Unsafe sanitation practices and the spread of preventable diseases are a large part of Uganda water crisis.

Last year, on the United Nations’ International Day of Peace and Ceasefire there were recorded celebrations in 192 countries including the City of Charleston.On Peace Day 2008, the United Nations Department for Safety and Security, which monitors security related incidents, recorded a 70% reduction in violent incidents in <a href=""http://www.peaceoneday.org/en/truce-2012/afghanistan"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent;""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000"">Afghanistan</font></a>; YOU SEE THE DAY WORKS.  It is this recorded reduction in violent incidents that has prompted the call for a Global Truce on Peace Day, what is hoped will be the largest reduction in global violence in recorded history – from violence in our homes, communities and schools, through to armed conflict.<br/></p>

Peace Happens every day!  CP1D Invites All People to Join in Action & Celebration To Create Tangible Peace, Non-Violence & Community Building For the International Day of Peace the Week of September 14-21.
The International Day of Peace is approaching and CP1D is working again to join our citizens together in action and celebration! CP1D is taking a different approach this year in order to expand the reach and impact with a new campaign, PEACE HAPPENS: One Week of Peace. The PEACE HAPPENS campaign is asking for individuals, businesses, non-profits, organizations, educators, media sources, faith circles, and all citizen groups to take action throughout South Carolina in their own unique way. The goal is to inspire us each to collectively do our part in working toward a culture of non-violence, intercultural cooperation, and humanitarian action that is relevant to our everyday lives. 
 
Earth Day was set to mark a day where people could responsibly take steps toward protecting the earth.  Peace Day is a day where the global community comes together to create responsible acts for saving and protecting all peoples, and resources of this planet.  It is a day of non-violence, of respect, and intercultural cooperation.
 
For the last 3 years, CP1D has made an impact by hosting a festival that has reached over 4,000 people to celebrate and teach peace, non-violence, and intercultural cooperation in Charleston through entertainment, education, and action.  We have seen this day work both locally and globally to inspire and bring about humanitarian action and education that wouldn't be possible without the day's call to action. Because of the festival, there are now year-round education programs that teach non-violence in schools and other special programs. Last year, on the United Nations’ International Day of Peace and Ceasefire there were recorded celebrations in 192 countries including the City of Charleston.On Peace Day 2008, the United Nations Department for Safety and Security, which monitors security related incidents, recorded a 70% reduction in violent incidents in Afghanistan; YOU SEE THE DAY WORKS.  It is this recorded reduction in violent incidents that has prompted the call for a Global Truce on Peace Day, what is hoped will be the largest reduction in global violence in recorded history – from violence in our homes, communities and schools, through to armed conflict.
 
“The UN International Day of Peace on 21 September every year is not only about creating peace between nations, it’s about non-violence in our homes, communities and schools. Therefore Peace Day is relevant to every human being on the planet.""www.peaceoneday.org
 
As awareness spreads...So does change! During the PEACE HAPPENS week, CP1D will work challenge, document and connect all the action that takes place throughout South Carolina, showing how our citizens are actively working to bring violence levels down throughout our state. The goal is to engage over eighty separate initiatives all over the state. CAN YOU IMAGINE THE IMPACT! 
 
We already have over 30 groups committed to action. WHAT WILL YOU DO TO CREATE PEACE IN YOUR COMMUNITY? TAKE PART. SEND CP1D YOUR COMMITMENT FOR THE WEEK OF PEACE TODAY! CP1D will get you PEACE HAPPENS resources and stickers and publicize what you are doing to make a difference.
