<p><strong><strong>My name is Abay Kennedy and I grew up in Ethiopia. As a child, I observed the devastating impact of droughts and famine on my family, community, and homeland. Even though I currently reside in the United States, Ethiopia is never far from my mind. Bringing modern irrigation techniques to my homeland is a heartfelt and passionate endeavor. If you can make a contribution to this project, I will be personally grateful.</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>In the hot, arid climate of Ethiopia, farming is highly dependent on the wet season in order to grow sufficient food for both people and livestock for the entire year. The goal of the Abay Agricultural Project (AAP) is to bring modern dry farming to the area. This will allow us to increase crop production three to four times by relying upon irrigation and more drought resistant crops as opposed to cultivating traditional crops in the rainy season. This approach drastically increases farming efficiency and minimizes the potential for famines, which have long plagued this region.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gibe River will be used for irrigation              Drought damaged corn crops </strong></p>
<h2><strong>What is Dry Farming? </strong></h2>
<p><strong>Dry farming is farming with techniques to compensate for a lack of natural rainfall. These techniques include the use of irrigation to bring in water from some other source and the growing of more drought resistant crops. The use of water-pump generators and other irrigation equipment, allows water to be pumped either from some body of water or an underground aquifer. This method reduces reliance upon rainfall which is often unpredictable in both time and amount. Irrigation places the control of agricultural water in the farmer’s hands rather than leaving him at the mercy of nature.</strong></p>
<p><img alt=""This is what dry farming look like"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/696701/pictures/full/20130308143542-Image5.jpg?1362782144"" src="""" style="""" title=""Sample photo dry farming""/></p>
<p><strong> Dry farming methods eliminate reliance on seasonal rain and increas food out put</strong></p>
<h2> <strong>AAP’s Project</strong>
</h2>
<p><strong>AAP has purchased about 1000 acres of land located near the Gibe River, one of the largest rivers in Ethiopia. The Gibe which flows year round is a very reliable source of water. The funding request is for $50,000 to purchase a water-pump generator and other irrigation equipment. This equipment will allow AAP to implement modern farming practices instead of relying upon traditional farming methods, which have often led to insufficient food production and famine.</strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/717606/pictures/full/20130321214732-IMG_1193.JPG?1363927657"" src="""" style=""""/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/710207/pictures/full/20130317205923-IMG_1899.jpg?1363579168"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>In addition to dry farming, AAP plans to introduce drought-resistant crops including wheat, barley, corn, cotton, and safflower.</strong></p>
<p><strong>AAP currently grows and raises a number of crops<strong> during the rainy season, </strong>some for experiumental purposes only, <strong>which includes </strong>:</strong></p>
<p><strong>• Food Crops - Corn, Wheat, Teff, Millet &amp; Sorghum</strong></p>
<p><strong>• Pulse Crops - Soya Beans, Haricot Beans, Horse Beans, Chickpeas, Lentils &amp; Field Peas</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>• Vegetables Crops - Garlic, Onions, Tomatoes, Lettuce &amp; Green  Peppers </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Commercial Livestock Production </strong></p>
<h2><strong> Purpose</strong></h2>
<p><strong>The purpose of this project is to increase food production in a poor drought ridden country. AAP proposes to do this by the implementation of modern dry farming techniques. This will substantially improve life for many people in this famine prone area in both the immediate future as well as for many years to come. If this conversion to dry farming and other modern practices proves successful, then we predict that this approach will spread to other farms, communities, and countries in Africa.</strong></p>
<p><strong>While Ethiopian soil creates a fertile growing environment, much of the land’s potential is untapped. Traditionally, Ethiopian crops are only grown once a year in the rainy season. The rest of the year, the land is idle as sustenance crop production halts. Some regions of the country are too arid to successfully produce even one crop. When droughts occur, the rainy season becomes even shorter and this contributes to famine.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>The dry season follows the harvest of the wet season and the land becomes idle. The land dries out and consists of brown, dusty, and lifeless soil. Land, farmers, and plows are inactive for the next six to seven months. There is a lack of rain to sustain sufficient crops. Without growth of vegetation, food supplies become scarce. Livestock production is also hurt with <strong>overgrazing</strong> and shortages of feed. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Now is the time for AAP’s creative dry farming and drought-resistant farming ideas to be implemented on a large scale. AAP has already experimented with these techniques began by hiring local farmers to cultivate about 300 acres of land. These farmers successfully employed irrigation and planted drought resistant crops to produce sustainable food, year round!</strong></p>
<p><strong>AAP is also educating farmers about improved seed varieties and agricultural practices. These farmers will serve as role models who will help whole communities improve the yields from their harvests. <strong>If we get full funding, this project is expected to be completed by mid-2014.</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>The two major benefits of this campaign are job creation and the sustainable year round production of food. Job creation is important because it becomes a “force multiplier” for the other positive benefits of the campaign. People with good jobs not only are able to support themselves and their families but they help support various other local businesses and the employees of those businesses through their purchase of goods and services. More people with jobs mean a better more prosperous community.</strong></strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/715644/pictures/full/20130320223417-corn.jpeg?1363844063"" src="""" style=""""/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/715680/pictures/full/20130320225318-Local_workers.jpeg?1363845205"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong><strong>This campaign will create jobs in three types of ways. First when the Abay Agricultural Project is in fully operational it will have positions for 10 permanent full time employees, with the possibility of more in any future expansion. Second AAP will be requiring between 50 and 100 seasonal employees for work on planting and harvests. Finally, in the long term this project will create other jobs in the community as other farmers come in and copy our methods and approach. Students from local schools will also be coming in to learn and eventually copy what we are doing when they get involved in farming themselves.</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>Having three to four harvests per year instead of only one will protect the area from the famines that have plagued it for so many years. In additoin the production of surplus food will contribute substantially to the economic development of the region. These benefits will go to the people directly rather than being filtered through government bureacracies and officials, as is the case with many foreign aid programs. <strong>People will learn to help themselves rather than being dependent on handouts from other countries or the government.</strong></strong></strong><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>

My name is Abay Kennedy and I grew up in Ethiopia. As a child, I observed the devastating impact of droughts and famine on my family, community, and homeland. Even though I currently reside in the United States, Ethiopia is never far from my mind. Bringing modern irrigation techniques to my homeland is a heartfelt and passionate endeavor. If you can make a contribution to this project, I will be personally grateful.
In the hot, arid climate of Ethiopia, farming is highly dependent on the wet season in order to grow sufficient food for both people and livestock for the entire year. The goal of the Abay Agricultural Project (AAP) is to bring modern dry farming to the area. This will allow us to increase crop production three to four times by relying upon irrigation and more drought resistant crops as opposed to cultivating traditional crops in the rainy season. This approach drastically increases farming efficiency and minimizes the potential for famines, which have long plagued this region.
Gibe River will be used for irrigation              Drought damaged corn crops 
What is Dry Farming? 
Dry farming is farming with techniques to compensate for a lack of natural rainfall. These techniques include the use of irrigation to bring in water from some other source and the growing of more drought resistant crops. The use of water-pump generators and other irrigation equipment, allows water to be pumped either from some body of water or an underground aquifer. This method reduces reliance upon rainfall which is often unpredictable in both time and amount. Irrigation places the control of agricultural water in the farmer’s hands rather than leaving him at the mercy of nature.

 Dry farming methods eliminate reliance on seasonal rain and increas food out put
 AAP’s Project

AAP has purchased about 1000 acres of land located near the Gibe River, one of the largest rivers in Ethiopia. The Gibe which flows year round is a very reliable source of water. The funding request is for $50,000 to purchase a water-pump generator and other irrigation equipment. This equipment will allow AAP to implement modern farming practices instead of relying upon traditional farming methods, which have often led to insufficient food production and famine.

 In addition to dry farming, AAP plans to introduce drought-resistant crops including wheat, barley, corn, cotton, and safflower.
AAP currently grows and raises a number of crops during the rainy season, some for experiumental purposes only, which includes :
• Food Crops - Corn, Wheat, Teff, Millet & Sorghum
• Pulse Crops - Soya Beans, Haricot Beans, Horse Beans, Chickpeas, Lentils & Field Peas
 • Vegetables Crops - Garlic, Onions, Tomatoes, Lettuce & Green  Peppers 
• Commercial Livestock Production 
 Purpose
The purpose of this project is to increase food production in a poor drought ridden country. AAP proposes to do this by the implementation of modern dry farming techniques. This will substantially improve life for many people in this famine prone area in both the immediate future as well as for many years to come. If this conversion to dry farming and other modern practices proves successful, then we predict that this approach will spread to other farms, communities, and countries in Africa.
While Ethiopian soil creates a fertile growing environment, much of the land’s potential is untapped. Traditionally, Ethiopian crops are only grown once a year in the rainy season. The rest of the year, the land is idle as sustenance crop production halts. Some regions of the country are too arid to successfully produce even one crop. When droughts occur, the rainy season becomes even shorter and this contributes to famine.  
The dry season follows the harvest of the wet season and the land becomes idle. The land dries out and consists of brown, dusty, and lifeless soil. Land, farmers, and plows are inactive for the next six to seven months. There is a lack of rain to sustain sufficient crops. Without growth of vegetation, food supplies become scarce. Livestock production is also hurt with overgrazing and shortages of feed. 
Now is the time for AAP’s creative dry farming and drought-resistant farming ideas to be implemented on a large scale. AAP has already experimented with these techniques began by hiring local farmers to cultivate about 300 acres of land. These farmers successfully employed irrigation and planted drought resistant crops to produce sustainable food, year round!
AAP is also educating farmers about improved seed varieties and agricultural practices. These farmers will serve as role models who will help whole communities improve the yields from their harvests. If we get full funding, this project is expected to be completed by mid-2014.
The two major benefits of this campaign are job creation and the sustainable year round production of food. Job creation is important because it becomes a “force multiplier” for the other positive benefits of the campaign. People with good jobs not only are able to support themselves and their families but they help support various other local businesses and the employees of those businesses through their purchase of goods and services. More people with jobs mean a better more prosperous community.

This campaign will create jobs in three types of ways. First when the Abay Agricultural Project is in fully operational it will have positions for 10 permanent full time employees, with the possibility of more in any future expansion. Second AAP will be requiring between 50 and 100 seasonal employees for work on planting and harvests. Finally, in the long term this project will create other jobs in the community as other farmers come in and copy our methods and approach. Students from local schools will also be coming in to learn and eventually copy what we are doing when they get involved in farming themselves.
Having three to four harvests per year instead of only one will protect the area from the famines that have plagued it for so many years. In additoin the production of surplus food will contribute substantially to the economic development of the region. These benefits will go to the people directly rather than being filtered through government bureacracies and officials, as is the case with many foreign aid programs. People will learn to help themselves rather than being dependent on handouts from other countries or the government. 

Funding
I hope that you strongly consider funding this worthwhile project to allow us to:


Purchase irrigation water-pump generators, Portable & Stationary


fund sprinklers,  pipes, valves & accessories


Cover  expenses for professional services for equpiment installation and R&D on drought resistant crops 



Cover overhead expenses

If we don't get full funding for our project, we will use the money we have received for the rental of irrigation equipment to be used for the implementation of as much of the project as possibile.

Krishna is the owner, crafts man, tea man, and head Herbal Healer.  Born and raised in Hopkins Village, the traditional knowledge of plants has been passed on to him from the elders of the community.  Over the years, his research of the medicinal properties of Belizean plants has inspired him to cultivate his own yard in an organic eco-friendly manner.  This love of plants and passion for healthy living, has led to creation of Herbal Healers.

<h3>The BIG why?</h3>
<p>VolunCheers was created in response to the growing awareness that in a world of finite resources we can not continue to operate a linear supply chain.</p>
<p>Bill McKibben, Annie Leonard, David Korten, Maude Barlow, Jeff Skoll, Al Gore, Patrick Kennedy, and so many others; academicians, scientists, economists, and thought provocateurs have detailed that without a concerted effort the world ahead of us will face unprecendented challenges.</p>
<p>The short list includes fresh water shortage, massive migration of millions, wildfires, dead zones in oceans, toxic rivers, arable lands desertified, food shortages, epic natural disasters, etc.</p>
<p>VolunCheers intends to be a univesral platform which, by design, encourages more people to consider volunteering and for those who already volunteer to volunteer more often!</p>
<h3>Origin Story</h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">For those unfamiliar with me, Ted Regan, the brief tale is that:</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">“<em>I was born on the crest of a wave and rocked in the cradle of the deep; I is, I am, I argh!</em>”</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The longer story is that I consider myself a <em>serial social entrepreneur,</em> in other words, someone who finds joy in creating products and services that benefit society.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> My favorite accomplishments include:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""MsoNormal"">Leading a benefit sea-kayak expedition from Maine to Florida (1999): teaching youth along the eastern seaboard the difference between 'acceptable and unacceptable risky behavior'.</li>
<li class=""MsoNormal"">Assembling a team to purchase an island in Casco Bay, Maine to not only preserve in perpetuity but also to transform into a school <em>'Learning Adventures, Living Classrooms'</em> for experiential environmental education.<span style="""">  </span>Check out: <a href=""http://www.rippleffect.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.rippleffect.net</a>

</div>
<div>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">More followed but none captured my imagination as much as <strong>VolunCheers: </strong>an idea born at the<strong> Skoll World Forum</strong> 2010. The possibility of constructing a universal social platform that would enable non-profit organizations to operate more effectively and efficiently, narrowly channeling their energies into mission delivery instead of operations, excited me beyond belief! (<em>some pirate, eh?!</em>)</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> ""Trifecta!"" I declared. Or rather: ""Shiver me Timbers"".</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Considering the latest social innovations and technological tools the solution became crystal clear: By turning service HOURS into POINTS and the POINTS into a score, a MERIT SCORE, we could simultaneously benefit those in need, the non-profits that serve them, and the volunteers who are the foot soldiers of every non-profit organization!</p>
<h3 class=""MsoNormal""><strong> Why is this SO important to me?</strong></h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Three reasons:</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">1. As a senior executive of NPOs for the last fifteen years I can honestly tell you I did NOT manage my volunteer programs well- recruiting and training- yes! But the backside: ‘tracking, recognizing and rewarding….’ there never seemed to be enough hours in the day. It still makes me ill with regret.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">2. In discussion with many a volunteer, from all over the country, I will share this oft revealed secret: MOST feel “ridden hard and left out wet”, “disposable”, “just another cog in the wheel”, “I’ve been rippled”! We MUST do this better.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">3. We are more than our CREDIT score! Entry to higer education, reduction in mortgage interest, access to capital;  all define your personal and professional trajectory. Too often many are shut out of these opportunities due a minor lapse in domestic responsibility. No fun, not fair.</p>
<h3 class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Why might this idea be SO important to you?</strong></h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Your generous gift in support of this URGENT endeavor will enable yet another star in the <em>sharing economy</em> constellation to alight. Specifically, it will foster more robust local economies, sustainable social service organizations, and vibrant, abundant communities.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In other words with happier, demonstrably appreciated volunteers participating in communities there will be more food served to the poor, more care delivered to the elderly, more pets given medical treatment, more trees planted, more rivers cleaned, more oceans restored, etc.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">THis is important because statistically, 98% of us will be impacted one way or another by many of the concerns stated above, and will require the services of a volunteer. AND many of us who volunteer could benefit from having that data captured, posted, celebrated, affording us opportunities largely only available to those already at the apex of the food chain.</p>
<h3 class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Much has been done already, but...</strong></h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">To date I have written a business plan, produced a slide deck, imagined and acted in a really silly promo video-(that's promo, not porno) besides conducting countless hours of interviews and creating reams of research. In addition, a draft website, a prototype if you will, has been built detailing our intentions, (hopefully you have already checked it out?!)

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
Hello.  <br/><br/>My name is Doug Looms.  My wife Thelma (better known as Cookie) and I live in Larkspur, Colorado (halfway between Denver and Colorado Springs) and we need your help to avoid being evicted from our rental home.<br/><br/>I was laid off unexpectedly from my job at the beginning of July and my former employer provided less than two week's pay as severance.  This left us in a situation where we could only pay a portion of our August rent.  <br/><br/>I am already working part-time - but it does not pay enough to meet our monthly obligations.  I have also found a second part-time position that will start next week and have been blessed to find a full-time job that starts in mid-September.  This position, combined with the two part-time positions, will provide enough for us to get by.  It will also provide us with health insurance which which will reduce the cost of our prescriptions to manageable levels.  Unfortunately the new positions will not start providing income until the beginning of October and our landlord is unwilling to wait that long for us to get back on track.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
We need $5500 to placate our landlord, pay our utilities and prescriptions until the paychecks and benefits begin. This breaks out as follows:<br/><ul>
<li>    $4500 for current and past due rent and late fees</li>
<li>    $500 for current and past due utilities</li>
<li>    $500 for prescriptions</li>
</ul>
We have already asked everyone we know for help.  Now we are asking you.<br/><br/>ALL the money we receive will be paid forward to charities that shelter and feed the homeless in the Denver-Colorado Springs area by the end of the year.  <em>God works in mysterious ways</em> and perhaps, in our need, we are also His instrument for helping others.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
If you have ever been laid off or threatened with unemployment, you know the fear and uncertainty that we are experiencing.  We have often given money to a homeless person on the street corner or someone at a gas station that needed help getting enough gas to drive home, even when we could not really afford to, because we knew these people were in more need than we were.  <br/><br/>If you, like us, have unconditionally helped strangers in need, please help us now.  We appreciate any donation you can make, no matter how small.  A little goes a long way when we all help each other!<br/><br/>Doug likes photography and cooking and Cookie has studied Middle Egyptian hieroglyphs.  To say thank you for your help, we are offering some small perks.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
You may not be able to contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help:<br/><br/>Please help us by spreading the word about this fundraiser to your friends and family (especially on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, etc.) so that as many people as possible come across our donation page.<br/><br/>Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools! This will help increase our rankings on the Indiegogo site.<br/><br/>Your prayers, positive thoughts and encouraging messages are also appreciated.<br/><br/>Thanks again!!!</div></div>","Short Summary

	We spent the last years looking for information and documentation to make 
possible this great journey throughout the five continents. We will travel about 
300.000 Km and 111 countries in 80 months. Currently we are travelling across 
the South-American routes.<br/><br/>To make this trip we have got rid of many 
possessions even our own house. <strong>Today we are sharing a great dream with

	Assembling “Libertad”- our motor home- took us 3 years working</font></p>

<p align=""justify""><span class=""auto-style32""><font color=""#0E4BDA"" size=""3"">Our mission, 
one purpose</font><span class=""auto-style32"">
</span></span></p>
<p align=""justify""><font color=""#333333"" size=""3"">We want to leave 
our children other teachings. We will share other values with them, as spending 
time together, embracing the same dream, the same mission. Our aim is to improve 
the world and our proposal is to encourage people to plant trees. </font></p>
<p align=""justify""><font color=""#333333"" size=""3"">It would help to 
reduce global warming. If we can create that consciousness in each person, we 
will be able to change the global consciousness and contribute to reach a 
solution. </font></p>

<p align=""justify""><font color=""#0E4BDA"" size=""3"">Why we do need 
financial support</font></p>
<p align=""justify""><font color=""#333333"" size=""3"">
We need financing to continue the trip and working in the production of the 
multimedia material to be followed by the web, since we have incorporated the 
idea of doing a documentary series of our trip, and this needs to improve the 
current equipment. </font></p>
<p align=""justify""><font color=""#333333"" size=""3"">The idea of 
recording our trip in order to later make a documentary requires an improvement 
of our current technological equipment. We need better computers and storage 
equipment; we must improve the transmission and upload material; we need 
high-definition cameras and microphones. We need financial support to carry on 
working on our website.</font></p>
<p align=""justify""><font color=""#333333"" size=""3"">Our motor home 
is an ecological vehicle which is party prepared to work using used vegetable 
oil but we need equipment to make it possible. We need financial support to 
cross the motor home to Panama, to make some mechanical changes to the vehicle, 
to pay visas and tolls, to take care or our health and other expenses.<br/><span><br/>Every little achievement will help us to go on 
seeking another one. We will buy the necessary pieces of equipment, we will look 
for another ways of funding. If we had to stop somewhere to do temporary jobs, 
the trip could take us more than expected.<br/><br/>We have turned to Indiegogo 
because we think it is a reliable platform to raise money and go on working on 
the documentary while travelling.<br/><br/>A lot of people have already joined us. 
They help us in this dream and accompany us in this journey. It would be 
impossible to do it by ourselves. Some enterprises have provided us with spare 
parts, services and advice. Some ordinary people have offered their support. All 
of them are part of this journey. <br/><br/>We have divided the journey into 
stages. The first stage will be to get to Alaska and from Alaska to New York 
where we will take a roll-on roll-off ship towards Hamburg, ending the first 
chapter which is America. </span> </font></p>
<span>
<p align=""justify"">
<span><font color=""#333333"" size=""3"">
Today your support is very important since it allows 
us to carry on travelling and sharing stories and landscapes accomplishing our 
mission.</font></span></p>

Hola, somos una familia que está dando la vuelta al mundo, hace poco mas de un año que comenzamos el viaje de 
nuestras vidas a bordo de una casa rodante construida por nosotros mismos, un sueño 
en que trabajamos más de 15 años y que hoy transformamos en realidad. </font></p>
<p align=""justify""><font color=""#333333"" size=""3""> 

	Los últimos años fueron un gran trabajo de preparación, búsqueda de 
información y documentación para realizar este gran viaje por los 5 
continentes. Recorreremos alrededor de 300.000 km y 111 países en 80 meses, actualmente estamos recorriendo las rutas de 
Sudamérica. </font></p>

<p align=""justify"">
<font color=""#0E4BDA"" size=""3"">Para que necesitamos el financiamiento</font></p>
<p align=""justify""><font color=""#333333"" size=""3"">Necesitamos financiación para 
continuar el viaje trabajando en la producción del material multimedia para que 
nos puedan seguir en la web, ya que hemos incorporado la idea de 
hacer una serie documental de nuestro viaje, y esto requiere de mejorar el equipamiento actual. Necesitamos 
mejorar el 
equipamiento informático (computadoras para edición y medios de almacenamiento), 
comunicaciones (para mejorar la transmisión y subir el material a la web) y 
fílmico (camaras hd, steady cam, microfono, etc). </font></p>
<p align=""justify""><font color=""#333333"" size=""3"">También 
necesitamos adquirir equipamiento para hacer funcionar el vehículo a aceite 
vegetal usado, ya que parte del mismo ya lo hemos preparado para tal uso, para 
que sea aún mas ecológico, para cruzar el vehiculo en barco a Panamá, para hacer algunos 
cambios mecánicos en el vehículo, que requieren de inversión, además de todos los costos que implica este viaje, visas, peajes, salud, etc. <br/><br/>
Si cumplimos la meta parcialmente 
nos ayudará a continuar cumpliendo etapas. Compraremos parte del equipamiento, 
buscaremos otras vías de 
financiamiento y quizás vayamos mas lento, pues pararemos en algunos lugares 
para hacer trabajos temporales. <br/><br/>
Hemos recurrido a Indiegogo pues nos parece 
óptimo para poder recaudar fondos y poder seguir el viaje, trabajando en la 
producción documental del mismo y compartir mas fluidamente el material con el 
mundo. </font></p>
<p align=""justify""><font color=""#333333"" size=""3"">Mucha gente se sumó, nos ayuda en 
este sueño y nos acompaña en este viaje. Sería imposible para nosotros hacerlo solos, hay empresas que nos ayudaron con equipamiento para el vehículo, con 
repuestos, con servicios y asesoramiento, hay personas que nos brindaron su apoyo en 
forma individual de distintas maneras. Todos son parte de este viaje.</font></p>
<p align=""justify"">
<font color=""#333333"" size=""3"">Hemos dividido el viaje en etapas. La 
primera etapa es hasta Alaska y de allí a New York, donde tomaremos un barco 
Roll On - Roll off hacia Hamburgo, concluyendo el primer capítulo que es América. </font></p>
<p align=""justify""><font color=""#333333"" size=""3"">Hoy es muy importante 
para nosotros sumar tu apoyo, para poder seguir recorriendo kilómetros y 
compartiendo historias, paisajes y cumpliendo nuestra misión.</font></p>

One Family, One Dream, One 
Journey 

 
Hi, we are a family travelling around the world. About a year ago we began the 
journey of our lives driving a motor home designed and assembled by ourselves. 
It is a dream in which we have worked for more than 15 years.

 

	We spent the last years looking for information and documentation to make 
possible this great journey throughout the five continents. We will travel about 
300.000 Km and 111 countries in 80 months. Currently we are travelling across 
the South-American routes.To make this trip we have got rid of many 
possessions even our own house. Today we are sharing a great dream with 
you.

	Assembling “Libertad”- our motor home- took us 3 years working

Our mission, 
one purpose

We want to leave 
our children other teachings. We will share other values with them, as spending 
time together, embracing the same dream, the same mission. Our aim is to improve 
the world and our proposal is to encourage people to plant trees. 
It would help to 
reduce global warming. If we can create that consciousness in each person, we 
will be able to change the global consciousness and contribute to reach a 
solution. 

Why we do need 
financial support

We need financing to continue the trip and working in the production of the 
multimedia material to be followed by the web, since we have incorporated the 
idea of doing a documentary series of our trip, and this needs to improve the 
current equipment. 
The idea of 
recording our trip in order to later make a documentary requires an improvement 
of our current technological equipment. We need better computers and storage 
equipment; we must improve the transmission and upload material; we need 
high-definition cameras and microphones. We need financial support to carry on 
working on our website.
Our motor home 
is an ecological vehicle which is party prepared to work using used vegetable 
oil but we need equipment to make it possible. We need financial support to 
cross the motor home to Panama, to make some mechanical changes to the vehicle, 
to pay visas and tolls, to take care or our health and other expenses.Every little achievement will help us to go on 
seeking another one. We will buy the necessary pieces of equipment, we will look 
for another ways of funding. If we had to stop somewhere to do temporary jobs, 
the trip could take us more than expected.We have turned to Indiegogo 
because we think it is a reliable platform to raise money and go on working on 
the documentary while travelling.A lot of people have already joined us. 
They help us in this dream and accompany us in this journey. It would be 
impossible to do it by ourselves. Some enterprises have provided us with spare 
parts, services and advice. Some ordinary people have offered their support. All 
of them are part of this journey. We have divided the journey into 
stages. The first stage will be to get to Alaska and from Alaska to New York 
where we will take a roll-on roll-off ship towards Hamburg, ending the first 
chapter which is America.  



Today your support is very important since it allows 
us to carry on travelling and sharing stories and landscapes accomplishing our 
mission.

Una Familia, un sueño, un viaje
 
Hola, somos una familia que está dando la vuelta al mundo, hace poco mas de un año que comenzamos el viaje de 
nuestras vidas a bordo de una casa rodante construida por nosotros mismos, un sueño 
en que trabajamos más de 15 años y que hoy transformamos en realidad. 
 

	Los últimos años fueron un gran trabajo de preparación, búsqueda de 
información y documentación para realizar este gran viaje por los 5 
continentes. Recorreremos alrededor de 300.000 km y 111 países en 80 meses, actualmente estamos recorriendo las rutas de 
Sudamérica. 
Para realizar este viaje nos 
	despojamos de muchas cosas materiales, hasta de nuestra propia casa...hoy 
estamos compartiendo un gran sueño con ustedes

	Durante la construcción de la casa rodante que nos acompañara en este 
viaje, 
a la que hemos bautizado ""Libertad"", un proceso que nos llevó 3 años.

Una misión, una 
propuesta
Queremos 
dejarles a nuestros hijos otras enseñanzas, compartiremos con ellos otras 
riquezas, el tiempo en familia, un mismo sueño y una misión: queremos 
contribuir a dejarles un mundo mejor y hacerlos participes de ello, con una propuesta, en cada lugar que visitamos 
llevamos el mensaje de plantar 
	árboles -una solución para contrarrestar el cambio climático- si 
	creamos esa conciencia a nivel individual, lograremos cambiar la conciencia 
	global y contribuir a la solución.



Para que necesitamos el financiamiento
Necesitamos financiación para 
continuar el viaje trabajando en la producción del material multimedia para que 
nos puedan seguir en la web, ya que hemos incorporado la idea de 
hacer una serie documental de nuestro viaje, y esto requiere de mejorar el equipamiento actual. Necesitamos 
mejorar el 
equipamiento informático (computadoras para edición y medios de almacenamiento), 
comunicaciones (para mejorar la transmisión y subir el material a la web) y 
fílmico (camaras hd, steady cam, microfono, etc). 
También 
necesitamos adquirir equipamiento para hacer funcionar el vehículo a aceite 
vegetal usado, ya que parte del mismo ya lo hemos preparado para tal uso, para 
que sea aún mas ecológico, para cruzar el vehiculo en barco a Panamá, para hacer algunos 
cambios mecánicos en el vehículo, que requieren de inversión, además de todos los costos que implica este viaje, visas, peajes, salud, etc. 
Si cumplimos la meta parcialmente 
nos ayudará a continuar cumpliendo etapas. Compraremos parte del equipamiento, 
buscaremos otras vías de 
financiamiento y quizás vayamos mas lento, pues pararemos en algunos lugares 
para hacer trabajos temporales. 
Hemos recurrido a Indiegogo pues nos parece 
óptimo para poder recaudar fondos y poder seguir el viaje, trabajando en la 
producción documental del mismo y compartir mas fluidamente el material con el 
mundo. 
Mucha gente se sumó, nos ayuda en 
este sueño y nos acompaña en este viaje. Sería imposible para nosotros hacerlo solos, hay empresas que nos ayudaron con equipamiento para el vehículo, con 
repuestos, con servicios y asesoramiento, hay personas que nos brindaron su apoyo en 
forma individual de distintas maneras. Todos son parte de este viaje.

Hemos dividido el viaje en etapas. La 
primera etapa es hasta Alaska y de allí a New York, donde tomaremos un barco 
Roll On - Roll off hacia Hamburgo, concluyendo el primer capítulo que es América. 
Hoy es muy importante 
para nosotros sumar tu apoyo, para poder seguir recorriendo kilómetros y 
compartiendo historias, paisajes y cumpliendo nuestra misión.

<p></p></div>","What's This All About?Well......I have been invited to compete for the Miss Universe Canada 2014 Pageant!!!  This year it takes place in Toronto on May 24th, 2014! With the help of my generous sponsors and their support last year, I made it into the top 20 finalists in the country in my first pageant. I think I can do even better this year, but I need your help! In 2013 competing for the first time in a pageant. Here is my Miss Universe Bio so you can learn a little more about me: Age: 26 | Height: 5’9″ |  Hometown: Mississauga
Andrea
was born in Sarajevo, Bosnia in 1987.  This was a pivotal time in the
separation of the former Yugoslavia that uprooted many families, including
Andrea’s to Belgrade, Serbia and eventually Mississauga, Ontario. Having
not spoken a word of English upon her arrival, Andrea was fluent after only 3
months! As an energetic, positive, and charismatic child, she found herself
interested in dancing, acting, and modeling. 
Andrea
dreamed of being a performer, which led her to attend Cawthra Park Secondary
School for the Arts. She would later live out that dream on a variety of
stages, including TV series, commercials, print campaigns, and modeling for
runway shows during Toronto Fashion Week.
Although
Andrea loves modeling and acting, you can tell she has the whole package by her
educational achievements. Andrea holds a degree from the University of Toronto,
in political science and a diploma from Sheridan College for Digital
Communications and is currently working toward getting her Canadian Securities
Certification.
Andrea
was working for an online advertising company in downtown Toronto but has
decided to take a leave of absence to pursue her dream of being an
international fashion model and is currently living in Shanghai, China. An
ambitious young professional, Andrea strives to one day run a business of her
own.
Her
love of travel has led her to explore over a dozen countries, and she plans to
visit all eight wonders of the world; she’s already crossed three off her list!
Andrea gladly welcomes the unknown and unfamiliar and
looks forward to tackling any challenge that comes her way!
  Winning Miss Universe Canada would be a dream come true. I really believe that this would provide a platform for bringing awareness to various causes and charities such as Scribble Me Silly. I’ve worked with this charity to bring the arts to young victims of violence through creative workshops put together by local artists. I've had the privilege of speaking at these workshops and it was such a rewarding experience.I hope that with my experiences, I am able to positively inspire and encourage young women and men to go after their dreams no matter how difficult they may seem. Hard work, dedication and persistence trumps all and I really believe if I can do it, you can do it too!!!How It Works & Why I Need YOUR Help… Each year, finalists from each province are asked to raise money from sponsors to cover their entry fee of $2,635.00. Since the company who runs the pageant, is a non-profit organization, that money is used to fund the week-long preparation and promotion prior to the pageant.*Donations over $50 Are Tex Deductible. I will provide a receipt for each donation.In exchange, sponsors’ names will appear in the official 2014 Miss Universe Canada magazine which is given to attendees the night of the event, as well as on the Miss Universe Canada website with a link to the sponsors' businesses. To me, that isn’t enough to express my gratitude for your support, and as you know I am currently in China, so I've set up a project here to make this process simple and to give you another token of appreciation with a more personal touch. I want to THANK YOU so much in advance - I really couldn’t do this without your support. :) :) :)Your future Miss Universe Canada,Andrea CXOXOXO",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<br/><p>After hundreds of designs, fabrications, testings and prototypes, we have chosen our final design that will begin production of the Friendly Flosser!</p>

<p>The Friendly Flosser is ergonomically designed to fit comfortably into your hand.  The trigger and thumb spool use the hands strongest positioning to maximize comfort while maximizing the effectiveness.  Taking advantage of the natural positioning of the thumb and fore-finger (i.e. using a hand gun trigger position or the pinch position), we were able to create a product that can easily be used using natural ergonomic positioning of the thumb and trigger finger.  The design of this product was to allow everyone to be able to use it with ease and efficiency so that even people with arthritis or a child can easily enjoy the Friendly Flosser. </p>
<p>The Friendly flosser is easy to open which allows the user to change the floss spool without having to purchase a new flosser.  Spools will be available on our website for 50%-70% of traditional retail floss sales.  We will offer quality floss with an array of colors and flavors. If you do not wish to purchase our floss, simply buy your own floss and try your hand and spooling your own favorite types of floss.  </p>
<p>Over this process, hundreds, if not thousands, of hours have gone into making the Friendly Flosser the best possible flosser.  Our development team has tested and retested every aspect of the flosser making it ready to use without error or flaw.  You will get a consumer quality product which will not need any addition tweaking.  Our vigorous design and testing team has made sure that all possible failures simply will not come into play while using.</p>
<p>The Friendly Flosser was designed with the user in mind.  We have revolutionized the flossing process and we have made affordable refills that will save you money as opposed to the alternative expensive flossing devices which full of let downs.  The Friendly Flossers mission statement is simple: <b><i>""An affordable refillable handheld flosser that renders the users teeth clean like they just left the dentist office!""</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Ladies and Gentlemen, we are proud to introduce the World's first refillable handheld flosser that gives the user full control of the tightness of the floss, and allows the user to give each tooth gap a new strand of floss every time:</p>

<p><b>WARNING: The Friendly Flosser is so easy to use you might get addicted.  Typical floss addicts symptoms include cleaner, whiter teeth, fresh breath, fewer cavities, healthy gums and larger wallets!</b></p>

<p>The spool will hold the approximately same or if not more floss as a tradition spool.  The Friendly Flosser allows you to use every inch of floss without wrapping it around your fingers while losing large quantities of floss, therefore Friendly Flosser Floss spools will last you a lot longer!</p>

The beans are in restaurants, churches, and shops throughout the area. But now it is time for Redbud Roasters to start a coffee house!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This campaign will provide only a portion of what we need to set up the storefront. We must pay for supplies, rent, and salaries, and if we're lucky, then we can put some towards renovating the building (by far our biggest expense) to get us off the ground. It's an old building that needs a full interior makeover. It needs a counter in the front, new plumbing configurations, a new floor and ceiling, men &amp; women's bathrooms, equipment and furniture. A coffee house is no small undertaking!</p>
<p>For your contribution, you will get some amazing perks. These items are exclusively for the contributors of this campaign.</p>
<p><img alt=""A grid of perks."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.redbudroasters.com/images/indiegogogridsmall550.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: baseline;"" title=""Perk Grid""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have enjoyed our years at the farmers market, either pulling coffee on a bike trailer or driving one of our biodiesel vehicles. For two years, we were at 4 markets a week, in New Braunfels, Wimberley, and San Marcos, never missing a single market outside of a couple of holidays. We fully appreciate that we have been able to grow our business during the limited hours each week that the markets provide, even though market hours can prove inconvenient for those that need a bag of beans, or just a simple cup of delicious brew many times of the week.</p>
<p>We have built this business from the ground up, and it has been a labor of love. But now it is time to expand into a brick and mortar storefront. We signed a lease at a shop on the corner of LBJ and MLK, an old liquor store with a drive thru.  Here our customers will know they will get what they need when they walk in or visit the drive-thru. </p>
<p>The roasting will be on-site and customers will be able to witness the beans transform during demonstrations in the back. The front of the house will have tables and lounging areas with expert baristas serving espresso drinks to be enjoyed in the relaxing atmosphere. Pounds of coffee beans and delicious locally sourced snacks will be available as well.</p>
<h3>A Bit More About Us</h3>
<p>We believe that solutions to global challenges lie at the local level. We see that all of our beans are fair trade, so the people that are involved with their processing are treated and compensated fairly. The beans are organic so the soil is taken care of. They are shade grown so the rain forest they grow in is taken care of. We use all compostable paper goods to reduce waste. We transport the beans to the local market on a bike trailer to reduce our fuel consumption. We have a wind turbine and solar panel system to generate power for the roaster, to reduce energy demand. We think that businesses should make changes like these for the better because every single customer, and every living thing for that matter, is to benefit from it.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

If you are interested and live locally, please shoot us an email (<a href=""mailto:contact@rebdudroasters.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">contact@redbudroasters.com</a>).</p>
<h3>A Word of Thanks</h3>
<p>We have already had so much help and support building this campaign, so we would like to give huge thanks to the community for their great loyalty, and willingness to speak on camera. Thanks to our family, particularly Alice Van Zant for supporting our dreams. Thanks to Felipe Portela for producing the amazing pitch video. Thanks to Totter Todd for producing the soundtrack music. Thanks to The Gulf Stream Ramblers (Molly Malinowski, Virginia Lee Worley, and Mary Van Zant) for performing the soundtrack music. And last but not least, thanks to all of those who love our beans, and want to see us succeed. Lots of love, Austin &amp; Mary</p></div>","Link to Video on YouTubeAustin and Mary Van Zant have been providing fresh roasted coffee to Central Texas for more than 2 years.  Austin roasts fair trade, organic, and shade grown coffee beans and has developed hundreds of regular customers at area Farmers Markets. The beans are in restaurants, churches, and shops throughout the area. But now it is time for Redbud Roasters to start a coffee house!


What We Need & What You Get
This campaign will provide only a portion of what we need to set up the storefront. We must pay for supplies, rent, and salaries, and if we're lucky, then we can put some towards renovating the building (by far our biggest expense) to get us off the ground. It's an old building that needs a full interior makeover. It needs a counter in the front, new plumbing configurations, a new floor and ceiling, men & women's bathrooms, equipment and furniture. A coffee house is no small undertaking!
For your contribution, you will get some amazing perks. These items are exclusively for the contributors of this campaign.



The Impact
We have enjoyed our years at the farmers market, either pulling coffee on a bike trailer or driving one of our biodiesel vehicles. For two years, we were at 4 markets a week, in New Braunfels, Wimberley, and San Marcos, never missing a single market outside of a couple of holidays. We fully appreciate that we have been able to grow our business during the limited hours each week that the markets provide, even though market hours can prove inconvenient for those that need a bag of beans, or just a simple cup of delicious brew many times of the week.
We have built this business from the ground up, and it has been a labor of love. But now it is time to expand into a brick and mortar storefront. We signed a lease at a shop on the corner of LBJ and MLK, an old liquor store with a drive thru.  Here our customers will know they will get what they need when they walk in or visit the drive-thru. 
The roasting will be on-site and customers will be able to witness the beans transform during demonstrations in the back. The front of the house will have tables and lounging areas with expert baristas serving espresso drinks to be enjoyed in the relaxing atmosphere. Pounds of coffee beans and delicious locally sourced snacks will be available as well.
A Bit More About Us
We believe that solutions to global challenges lie at the local level. We see that all of our beans are fair trade, so the people that are involved with their processing are treated and compensated fairly. The beans are organic so the soil is taken care of. They are shade grown so the rain forest they grow in is taken care of. We use all compostable paper goods to reduce waste. We transport the beans to the local market on a bike trailer to reduce our fuel consumption. We have a wind turbine and solar panel system to generate power for the roaster, to reduce energy demand. We think that businesses should make changes like these for the better because every single customer, and every living thing for that matter, is to benefit from it.

Other Ways You Can Help
Sharing this campaign can greatly increase its visibility in this social media world we live in! Like it! Share it! Spread the word! Word of mouth is even better. Tell a friend, and pique their interest. After all, they want to enjoy our shop in the future as well.
Take that a step further and join our Street Team to help spread the word. Requet to join the Facebook group called ""Redbud Roasters IGG Street Team"" or email molly.malinowksi@gmail.com to join.
If you aren't into that sort of thing, we may need some help building the coffee house: painting, construction, decorating. If you are interested and live locally, please shoot us an email (contact@redbudroasters.com).
A Word of Thanks
We have already had so much help and support building this campaign, so we would like to give huge thanks to the community for their great loyalty, and willingness to speak on camera. Thanks to our family, particularly Alice Van Zant for supporting our dreams. Thanks to Felipe Portela for producing the amazing pitch video. Thanks to Totter Todd for producing the soundtrack music. Thanks to The Gulf Stream Ramblers (Molly Malinowski, Virginia Lee Worley, and Mary Van Zant) for performing the soundtrack music. And last but not least, thanks to all of those who love our beans, and want to see us succeed. Lots of love, Austin & Mary",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><strong>I want to say thank you to everyone who has donated so far and helped us reach and exceed our initial goal of $2,000 for Aubrey. This campaign is still active, so if you haven’t yet and you would like to help this family, please donate.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update from Lindsey (Aubrey's Mommy) 7/24/12 “Bye bye hospital!! Although we have to stay in indy a bit longer, we are hospital free ;) best day ever”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Although they are out of the hopital now, the campaign is still active and they could still use your help with the large medical bills and other costs associated with having a sick child in the hospital for so long. Thank you again for all the love and support. -Chris Mathews</strong></p>
<p>My cousin Aubrey is very ill and far from home. On Saturday, July 15th, Aubrey along with her family were in Indianapolis for a cheer competition (Aubrey's mommy is a coach) and became ill. They took her to an Indianapolis Children's Hospital where they found out Aubrey has a bacterial infection that is spreading throughout her body. The infection has spread from her neck to her chest. It spread too rapidly, so they did surgery to drain some of the fluid.</p>
<p>Right now, the family has been told that she will be in the hospital at least 2 weeks. The Ronald McDonald house is on a waiting list and apparently will not allow children to stay. Did I mention Aubrey has 2 sisters? 1 older and 1 newborn. Mom and Dad are switching between being with Aubrey in ICU and being at the hotel with the newborn (babies can't be in the ICU room after 9pm).</p>
<p>As you might have guessed, being far from home and having to pay for a hotel room is going to cost a lot. Not counting the mounting medical bills and time away from work. </p>
<p>I am setting this up on their behalf, to help alleviate some of these costs. Anything you can give will go directly to them and might make some of this stress a little easier to manage.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p><strong>As we close out our campaign -  We missed the goal for Indigogo,  AND we did find a solution that will get us to the next stage.  The funds we raised here helped bridge that gap!  Thank you so much!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Organic Soda Revolution                </strong><br/>                <br/>Founded in 2009, Oogavé is a young, growing organic soda company based in Denver, Colorado and we could use your help!                 <br/>                <br/>As many people know, it takes the average company about 5 years to become profitable.  And cash flow is critical!  We've found ourselves short on cash, but long on opportunities and successes!  Sometimes you just need an extra push to get to the next phase!<br/>                <br/>If we were a big soda giant like P**** or C***, we wouldn't be calling on our organic-loving community for support.  Alas, we don't have deep pockets and gargantuan ad budgets like they do.  We hustle, negotiate and pour our hearts into this business.  We do it because we are passionate about having healthier options available for soda lovers everywhere.      </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://saveoogave.com/images/1b1d954c673a374f3a7e3aaedd4b6e12.png"" src="""" style=""""/>         <br/>                <br/><strong>Why do you need the money?                </strong><br/>The ""Big-2"" soda companies each sell more in 20 seconds than Oogavé sells in an entire year, no kidding!  Oogavé is definitely the underdog and needs your help.  We began four years ago in Denver, CO with a mission to bring a healthier soda to market, not knowing anything except that we had an awesome soda on our hands. Needless to say, it's been a lot tougher than we anticipated.                 <br/>                 <br/>In order to escape the shadows of the big giants and make sure we reach all of the consumers who would love to find us, it takes a lot... a lot of case sales and economies of scale.  That requires a lot of money, which is where we have run short.  We've always been a boot-strapping company and have turned precious few resources into great opportunity.  At this point we have fully allocated all of our own personal funds, our friends and family money, and our small investment capital.  We are nearing the goal line of cash flow positive, which will ensure our long-term viability.  Most start-ups take at least 5 years to stabilize.  This year is our 4th birthday and we are projecting another 18-24 months to become self-sustaining.             </p>
<p>                <br/>If you want to support a mom &amp; 'pop' operation (pun intended), care about the little guy, wrinkle your nose at corn-syrup, push for more organic food products, buy independent, dream big, and keep the dolphins safe, then we implore you to please participate with us at the highest level you can.  Each of these has its own reward for you, with great karmic implications!                                 <br/>                <br/><strong>What happens if you don't raise enough money?                </strong><br/>First and foremost, we will have a good solid cry.  Then, we'll pull ourselves up off the floor and take care of business.  All rewards will be delivered as promised regardless of the amount raised.  If we fall short of our goal, we'll continue to produce our awesome soda for as long as we can keep the doors open.  We are reducing all non-critical expenses and running parallel conversations with many new potential capital partners to help us grow.  We are confident that an investor will make up the difference with an equity investment and keep us moving forward.        </p>

<p>     <br/>                <br/><strong>If you reach your goal, will you have all you need to move forward on your own?  </strong>Our goal is to raise $500,000 which will help get us to cash flow positive in the next 18-24 months.  Once we hit that tipping point we can grow organically.              <br/>                <br/><strong>What will you use the money for?                </strong><br/>Your contribution will go towards the many operational costs of the business, including; overhead, marketing costs, sales promotions, tradeshows and keeping jobs alive in the organic sector.  We will be on track to grow our base of sales to a sustainable, long-term profitable level.  We also will be able to continue the development and launch of our diet version, Oogavé LoCa.  Just 10 calories!  Get excited!                <br/>                <br/><strong>How can I get more involved with your efforts?                </strong><br/>Run to the top of your nearest mountain and scream, ""I LOVE OOGAVE!!!"" at the top of your lungs.  If this is not feasible, you can settle for telling all your friends about our great organic soda, blow up the social media universe (don't be shy about sharing on FB, Twitter, Pinterest, your blog, etc), get an Oogavé tattoo on your arm, or name your pet after your favorite Oogavé flavor.                <br/>               </p>

<p><br/><strong>What's the story behind Oogavé?                </strong><br/>The idea for Oogavé organic sodas first came to Esteban Anson while running his small natural foods restaurant in downtown Denver. As a fanatic of quality, and a devotee of delicious and wholesome handcrafted foods, Esteban used only the best natural ingredients in his restaurant.                 <br/>                <br/>But when it came time to order sodas, Esteban and his customers were still frustrated by the lack of quality and choice in the world of soft drinks. Wanting to offer a variety of fountain sodas, Esteban was dismayed at the treatment and options available through the traditional “evil empire” soda companies. He didn’t want to sign his life away in iron-handed contracts, and he especially didn’t want to serve his customers anything made with processed sugar and High Fructose Corn Syrup. What to do? Esteban thought, ""Why not make my own all natural soda?

Organic Soda Revolution                                Founded in 2009, Oogavé is a young, growing organic soda company based in Denver, Colorado and we could use your help!                                 As many people know, it takes the average company about 5 years to become profitable.  And cash flow is critical!  We've found ourselves short on cash, but long on opportunities and successes!  Sometimes you just need an extra push to get to the next phase!                If we were a big soda giant like P**** or C***, we wouldn't be calling on our organic-loving community for support.  Alas, we don't have deep pockets and gargantuan ad budgets like they do.  We hustle, negotiate and pour our hearts into this business.  We do it because we are passionate about having healthier options available for soda lovers everywhere.      
 
                         Why do you need the money?                The ""Big-2"" soda companies each sell more in 20 seconds than Oogavé sells in an entire year, no kidding!  Oogavé is definitely the underdog and needs your help.  We began four years ago in Denver, CO with a mission to bring a healthier soda to market, not knowing anything except that we had an awesome soda on our hands. Needless to say, it's been a lot tougher than we anticipated.                                  In order to escape the shadows of the big giants and make sure we reach all of the consumers who would love to find us, it takes a lot... a lot of case sales and economies of scale.  That requires a lot of money, which is where we have run short.  We've always been a boot-strapping company and have turned precious few resources into great opportunity.  At this point we have fully allocated all of our own personal funds, our friends and family money, and our small investment capital.  We are nearing the goal line of cash flow positive, which will ensure our long-term viability.  Most start-ups take at least 5 years to stabilize.  This year is our 4th birthday and we are projecting another 18-24 months to become self-sustaining.             
                If you want to support a mom & 'pop' operation (pun intended), care about the little guy, wrinkle your nose at corn-syrup, push for more organic food products, buy independent, dream big, and keep the dolphins safe, then we implore you to please participate with us at the highest level you can.  Each of these has its own reward for you, with great karmic implications!                                                 What happens if you don't raise enough money?                First and foremost, we will have a good solid cry.  Then, we'll pull ourselves up off the floor and take care of business.  All rewards will be delivered as promised regardless of the amount raised.  If we fall short of our goal, we'll continue to produce our awesome soda for as long as we can keep the doors open.  We are reducing all non-critical expenses and running parallel conversations with many new potential capital partners to help us grow.  We are confident that an investor will make up the difference with an equity investment and keep us moving forward.        
 
                     If you reach your goal, will you have all you need to move forward on your own?  Our goal is to raise $500,000 which will help get us to cash flow positive in the next 18-24 months.  Once we hit that tipping point we can grow organically.                              What will you use the money for?                Your contribution will go towards the many operational costs of the business, including; overhead, marketing costs, sales promotions, tradeshows and keeping jobs alive in the organic sector.  We will be on track to grow our base of sales to a sustainable, long-term profitable level.  We also will be able to continue the development and launch of our diet version, Oogavé LoCa.  Just 10 calories!  Get excited!                                How can I get more involved with your efforts?                Run to the top of your nearest mountain and scream, ""I LOVE OOGAVE!!!"" at the top of your lungs.  If this is not feasible, you can settle for telling all your friends about our great organic soda, blow up the social media universe (don't be shy about sharing on FB, Twitter, Pinterest, your blog, etc), get an Oogavé tattoo on your arm, or name your pet after your favorite Oogavé flavor.                               

What's the story behind Oogavé?                The idea for Oogavé organic sodas first came to Esteban Anson while running his small natural foods restaurant in downtown Denver. As a fanatic of quality, and a devotee of delicious and wholesome handcrafted foods, Esteban used only the best natural ingredients in his restaurant.                                 But when it came time to order sodas, Esteban and his customers were still frustrated by the lack of quality and choice in the world of soft drinks. Wanting to offer a variety of fountain sodas, Esteban was dismayed at the treatment and options available through the traditional “evil empire” soda companies. He didn’t want to sign his life away in iron-handed contracts, and he especially didn’t want to serve his customers anything made with processed sugar and High Fructose Corn Syrup. What to do? Esteban thought, ""Why not make my own all natural soda? Heck, why not even make it organic?""                          Esteban was already a huge fan of agave nectar, using it in much of his baking and as a sugar substitute in many sauces and recipes. Esteban thought this wonder nectar just might make a delicious and healthier soda. And he was right! Read more at: http://www.oogave.com/index.cfm/about-us/

The Impact



The funding will go towards paying for the hosting of the website. After suffering a recent job loss I've had to take a long hard look at my expenses, with the cost of hosting and the domain as one of those.
One thing to bear in mind is that the blog will in no way disappear if the funding goal isn't reached. I will find the funds somewhere to keep things up regardless.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello there!</p>
<p>We are Rose Chang &amp; Stephanie Drabik, and together we run Crywolf. Crywolf is our online shop (<a href=""http://www.crywolfclothing.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.crywolfclothing.com</a>), where we design everything you see on the site and make the majority of it, with a few exceptions. We have based ourselves on a very DIY motto through the start of our business, and want to continue to do so. We have been  working out of our basement studios, and selling online and at trade shows trying to build our brand for the past 8 years. We feel that at this point, we have outgrown our home-based studios and the natural next step would be to gain our own little space in this big city! After years of contemplating and months of searching, we have taken the plunge and found and secured a retail/studio location in downtown Toronto which will be the new home of Crywolf! This is a HUGE step for us, and we can't do it alone.</p>
<p>Here is where you come in!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why we need you</h3>
<div>We have always relied heavily on the support of our fans and customers to keep going and keep growing. By purchasing one of our incentives, you will not only get an awesome Crywolf prize pack but you will also be contributing to help Crywolf, a local small business, continue to grow.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Our location will be at 91 Ossington Ave. in Toronto, Ontario. It will double as a retail and studio space where we will both create and sell magical things! Our lease will take effect in July but we plan on having our official opening in September 2013. <span>Since making this commitment recently, we know that we need the support of our community and the fan base that we have built to make this dream come true!</span>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Breakdown</h3>
</div>
<div>We have found and secured our retail location - but now we need your help! We are asking for $15,000.00. We would use the money towards:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: xx-small;"">Getting equipment for the store (shelving and fixtures, lighting and POS hardware)</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: xx-small;"">General renovations (</span><span>we need money to obtain permits, installing display units, paint, redoing the ceiling, and general fixer-uppers)</span>
</li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: xx-small;"">Setting up our studio with a space to facilitate screen printing and also to host public workshops</span></li>
<li><span>All funds raised will go directly towards setting up and completing our store. If we do not reach our goal we will accomplish as much as we can with what we have. Any money left over will be used to get a head start on inventory.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>In order to express our gratitude for donating money to our cause, we wanted to come up with really great incentives/prize packs. Each prize is unique to this campaign - the designs are custom and in limited edition colourways so you know you are getting something truly special when you donate! </div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p><span lang=""EN-CA"">We also plan on giving back to the community that supports us by having workshops that anyone can sign up for and learn about screenprinting and other fun projects. </span>We want to feature artists work in our shop in order to support new and upcoming local artists. Up until this point we have lived our lives doing what we love but are at a critical point where we need to expand and see where it takes us. We could never have gotten where we are today without our fans have supported us in our journey thus far and we hope you believe in this campaign as much as we do!</p>
</div>
<div>

</div></div>","Our Story
Hello there!
We are Rose Chang & Stephanie Drabik, and together we run Crywolf. Crywolf is our online shop (www.crywolfclothing.com), where we design everything you see on the site and make the majority of it, with a few exceptions. We have based ourselves on a very DIY motto through the start of our business, and want to continue to do so. We have been  working out of our basement studios, and selling online and at trade shows trying to build our brand for the past 8 years. We feel that at this point, we have outgrown our home-based studios and the natural next step would be to gain our own little space in this big city! After years of contemplating and months of searching, we have taken the plunge and found and secured a retail/studio location in downtown Toronto which will be the new home of Crywolf! This is a HUGE step for us, and we can't do it alone.
Here is where you come in!


Why we need you
We have always relied heavily on the support of our fans and customers to keep going and keep growing. By purchasing one of our incentives, you will not only get an awesome Crywolf prize pack but you will also be contributing to help Crywolf, a local small business, continue to grow.
 
Our location will be at 91 Ossington Ave. in Toronto, Ontario. It will double as a retail and studio space where we will both create and sell magical things! Our lease will take effect in July but we plan on having our official opening in September 2013. Since making this commitment recently, we know that we need the support of our community and the fan base that we have built to make this dream come true!


Breakdown

We have found and secured our retail location - but now we need your help! We are asking for $15,000.00. We would use the money towards:


Getting equipment for the store (shelving and fixtures, lighting and POS hardware)

General renovations (we need money to obtain permits, installing display units, paint, redoing the ceiling, and general fixer-uppers)

Setting up our studio with a space to facilitate screen printing and also to host public workshops
All funds raised will go directly towards setting up and completing our store. If we do not reach our goal we will accomplish as much as we can with what we have. Any money left over will be used to get a head start on inventory.


In order to express our gratitude for donating money to our cause, we wanted to come up with really great incentives/prize packs. Each prize is unique to this campaign - the designs are custom and in limited edition colourways so you know you are getting something truly special when you donate! 

The Impact



We also plan on giving back to the community that supports us by having workshops that anyone can sign up for and learn about screenprinting and other fun projects. We want to feature artists work in our shop in order to support new and upcoming local artists. Up until this point we have lived our lives doing what we love but are at a critical point where we need to expand and see where it takes us. We could never have gotten where we are today without our fans have supported us in our journey thus far and we hope you believe in this campaign as much as we do!


Other Ways You Can Help
We understand that not everyone may be able to contribute financially, but that doesn’t mean we can't use your help! We would love it if you could help get the word out about our campaign - spread it like a wildfire! The Indiegogo share tools make it super easy. 
and finally, we want to give our biggest THANK YOU for taking the time to explore our campaign and considering our project!

opened a building that had been sitting empty for 15 years, and over

<p>Why we need your help:</p>
<p>We wanted to reclaim a space to really support the people of

great projects including a national campaign that supported
young creatives, pop up art galleries, gourmet insect pop up
restaurants (you read that right the first time!) fashion pop ups and
new business networking evenings on no budget. Thanks to volunteers
and the support of the local community we've been able to begin to
turn the space from an abandoned building site in to a functional
community space.</p>
<p>However to refurbish the space and open other rooms in the venue,
we need your support to help create a sustainable cultural hub within
the city centre. We want to make sure that there is somewhere the
people of Glasgow have real ownership of and really connect with the
venue. 
</p>
<p>With your help we'll be able to stay open – continuing to
support interesting local projects as well as open more rooms for
people to use. We want to be a key space as part of Glasgow's
cultural landscape.</p>

<p>The name pretty much says it all. Or does it?</p><p><b>About The Fat Trainer:</b>
</p><p>I came up with that name in 2007 after struggling with losing weight.
 I was close to 270 pounds and miserable. I began learning how to change
 my body and through the course of my studies, I became a Personal 
Trainer.</p>
<p>I couldn’t call myself something like Fit and Fab because I was well over 200 pounds. Who would take me seriously?</p>
<p>As it turns out, my client base exploded right away. People could 
relate to someone large. They felt at ease and were more able to commit 
to working out.</p>
<p>My awards range from local to national. I have met the likes of 
Soledad O'Brien, Simon Cowell, Randy Jackson, Tanya Tucker (I bought her
 lunch in Venice Beach one afternoon), Leslie Jordan (I bought his 
breakfast at the Griddle in LA one late morning) and others.</p>
<p>Think about your gym. If you weighed 50, 75 or 100+ pounds more than 
you do right now, would THAT be the place you would want to go to and 
get help? A nice body doesn’t make a nice person. I know many trainers 
who are jerks. The Fat Trainer isn’t a place for them. It’s a place for 
you!</p>
<p><strong>Why should you help The Fat Trainer?</strong></p>
<p>We are trying to do good things in the world. We want to help those that feel they have no hope and no sense of belonging. We offer reduced prices and free programs several times a year for those that may not otherwise be able to afford training. Your funding will help us purchase equipment enabling us to use our current resources for helping those individuals make the leap to a happier and healthy life!</p>
<p>Our company is well established and we have a very loyal client base. The space is ready to go, we just need to fill it with the equipment our clients need to make that big lifestyle change. Check out our 
website. You can see the before and after photos of just a few of the 
many people that have participated in the program. They are real people who 
did what we asked and got results. There is no disclaimer that the 
results are not typical. These people had typical results, just like 
countless others. Our program works and we want to reach more people. 
YOU can help us! Check out our pictures and watch some of the progress of Studio 360° that YOU are helping make possible!<br/></p><p>We can reach out to those that feel intimidated by the big box gyms. We can make them comfortable. We have clients that have been with us from

</p><p>Picture the largest person you know. It could be a relative, friend 
or co-worker. They likely feel bad about themselves on a daily basis but
 are stuck in the same rut I was. I felt bad which made me eat more. I

about myself. THIS is exactly what sets me apart from the other gyms in 
my area - and probably yours. I have been through the transformation

founded Atacora in 2009, however the concept began long before that,
when I served in the Peace Corps in Boukombé, Benin, in the beautiful
Atacora Mountains, from 1992-1995. I learned much about the region's
flora and culture, and planted tens of thousands of trees with rural
participants. I also saw the failure of foreign aid model to create
sustainable community development. The wealth of resources; human and
natural, which are abundantly available, had never yielded much in
the way of economic benefit to the communities. Overexploitation of
resources and depressed markets and wages continue to allow poverty
and social inequality to reign.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">
After
earning a Master's degree from Antioch University Seattle focusing on
social change and sustainable development, I returned to Benin in
2007, and began to drum up an idea. With people I had known and
worked with many years earlier, I helped design a strategy to revalue
indigenous resources, promote sustainable resource use, and adhere to

making a difference one person at a time

I
founded Atacora in 2009, however the concept began long before that,
when I served in the Peace Corps in Boukombé, Benin, in the beautiful
Atacora Mountains, from 1992-1995. I learned much about the region's
flora and culture, and planted tens of thousands of trees with rural
participants. I also saw the failure of foreign aid model to create
sustainable community development. The wealth of resources; human and
natural, which are abundantly available, had never yielded much in
the way of economic benefit to the communities. Overexploitation of
resources and depressed markets and wages continue to allow poverty
and social inequality to reign.

After
earning a Master's degree from Antioch University Seattle focusing on
social change and sustainable development, I returned to Benin in
2007, and began to drum up an idea. With people I had known and
worked with many years earlier, I helped design a strategy to revalue
indigenous resources, promote sustainable resource use, and adhere to
Fair Trade principles to promote gender equality and healthy local
economy. In 2009, we began assembling our producer co-op and supply
chain, constructed our facility; and in January of 2010, began
production. It is clear that women can be a powerful engine for
development. Thus, our 30+ member Fair Partnership Women's Producer
Co-op is the heart and soul of our operation.

This
mission has taken over my very being to its core, and brought great
meaning and fulfillment to my life.
OUR PROJECT



Our
partners in Benin, West Africa who sell us Baobab
Fruit and Neem Seeds,
and the 30+ women in our Fair
Partnership Co-op have
gained a significant income boost by working with Atacora.  This
provides families with improved access to education (especially the
girls!), health care services and improved nutrition.



We
have worked very hard to open access to global markets for these
valuable natural products in order to create more employment for
women and bring African health traditions to the world.  The

to respond to customers' needs, we need to increase production, and
add the important values of Organic certification and thorough
laboratory analysis of our products.  These upgrades to the
operation require a significant up-front investment, and that is
precisely why we are starting an Indiegogo campaign.

This
is a deeply personal mission for me.  I served in the Peace

years ago.  Atacora is built on those relationships.  We
are partners.  We are family.  My partners and I recognize
that despite abundant natural and human resources in the area,
poverty's grip remains unrelenting.  We concluded that opening
market access could:


Help build a sustainable local economy. 
Promote social justice. 
Improve environmental stewardship. 
Create more employment for women.

We
know that women are the very heart and soul of that effort.  We
built our very small, rural production facility with our own hands on
family land, planting thousands of trees and medicinal plants on the
grounds.

WE NEED TO EXPAND AND OFFER MORE EMPLOYMENT TO SMALL ISOLATED VILLAGES IN WEST AFRICA



Baobab is

But doesn't shopping green cost more?!?

Cash back rewards for each and every purchase on our site!
One of the largest complaints we hear about green shopping, is it costs too much! We believe you get what you pay for, and have made it easier for you to go green by giving you green back for every purchase you initiate through our site (cash back rewards).
We reward good shopping behavior! 
Create an account to start earning cash back on environmental shopping today!www.GoodtoGreen.com
We are building a market place that reflects the future we need to create for generations and generations to come. We know it’s possible, but we need your help to build continuous momentum.
 
THE CAMPAIGN:
    SAVE THE PLANET. SHOP SMART.               

    We are raising a minimum of $50,000.

Our $50k+ crowdfunds will be used to:

Enhance the shopping experience (Ex: Add new site features that will recommend products just for you based on your shopping preferences).
Build more partnerships with prominent retailers.
Increase our education and outreach - Expand the Good to Green membership to a national audience.


Funding us means taking part in the movement to create a better future.  We are building a community of folks who can easily make an impact in reducing the planet's carbon footprint, and contributing to social justice and conscious commerce. All of this - without major behavioral change. Just a little bit of education and a click on mouse to purchase the items you would normally purchase anyways. But with Good to Green, you can trust your purchase power is actually making a difference.

All of this - without a major change in human behavior. Just a little bit of education and a few click of the mouse to purchase items you normally purchase anyways.
But with Good to Green, you can trust your purchase is a powerful purchase - because it actually makes a difference by investing in the future of our planet (by making a statement in rewarding good manufacturing practices).
 

Our crowdfunds will be used wisely, we promise! Most of us are volunteers!

Along with two of my partners i embarked on a project in which i have been researching,developing and testing out our proprietary trading algorithm/software which upon completion of this project should be able to trade any financial instrument profitably without any human intervention. I am at the point where i need to finalize my research and create an extraordinary software (a super hybrid machine compared to what we have achieved so far and whats out there in the open market) which will do great justice trading financial instruments.

There are two extremes in the market - FEAR AND GREED.<br/>2. Every traded financial instrument be it Fixed Income securities, Equities,Forex or commodities constantly moves from overbought positions (point where buy pressure is exhausted) and oversold positions (point where sell pressure is exhausted), and vise-visa.<br/>3. Understanding market direction is very vital part of ""Tape Reading"".<br/>4. Always seek to let your profits run,cut your losses and be very selective in your trades.<br/><br/>Executing trades via Human discretion has its numerous merits but also has some enormous disadvantages too.

<p>THANK YOU!!</p></div>","The Low-Tech Solution for High Connectivity
DignifieDesigns simple, memory-stimulating puzzles combine the right skill with beautiful pictures from the past. They help families connect with loved ones and provide an activity those with Alzheimer's, recovering from stroke or traumatic brain injury can accomplish.
Please watch this short video and see folks using our puzzles for the first time.
Honoring My Mother & Helping Other Families
I cared for my mother for many years, both in my home and eventually in a care center where she died from Alzheimer's. Over the years it was frustrating and sad to find there weren't any activities she could do that were designed for an adult--most are made for young children.
Our puzzles look to change that for other families. The images from our puzzles spark memories and conversations and the large pieces are lightweight and easy to handle.
Made in the USA from post-consumer materials, the puzzles are even dishwasher safe for easy sanitation!



Get Us Out of the Driveway & On the Road!
Our company dreams of being a Garage Start-Up, but we're still in the driveway and need YOUR help! Reaching our goal will allow us to:

Attend the fall National Health Care Association trade show
Build our inventory to fullfill orders

<p><span>We are a Non-Profit organization that advocates the responsible use of collective intelligence (CI) research</span>. We need a way to talk as a species and makes sense of it all. There are so many great ideas that need to be heard. We are building a global information center and tool set dedicated to a better world through massive online collaboration, deliberation, project planning, research and the shared innovation.</p>
<p>We are diverse a group of individuals who have taken previous bodies of individual research and pooled them into one system; the tribeforth system. With diverse specializations from Military intelligence, Artificial intelligence, Political Science, Journalism and Marketing we have committed ourselves to developing the best system of conversation and argumentation modern technology can provide.  </p>
<h2><strong>FAQ</strong></h2>
<h3>What is OpenThink Lab?</h3>
<p>It is a first of its kind global crowdsourcing project. OpenThink Lab is designed to stimulate an international conversation about our society. The job of the Tribeforth Foundation is to provide and develop infrastructure for that conversation. We are creating a tool to facilitate understanding and collaborative problem solving</p>
<h3>Doesn’t The Media Already Provide this Function?</h3>
<p>Politifact has offered some transformative steps in real time fact checking. Our project goes beyond simply fact checking politicians but creates an environment in which entire arguments can be fact checked and developed. The debate held by the public, rather than exclusively by their officials.</p>
<h3>What is Tribeforth's Involvement?</h3>
<p>Our job is to ensure that the conversation continues and stays open source. We will be using social media analytics and as well as working with different media agencies in order to ensure that the conversation gets adequate coverage in new and conventional media. Our job is it ensure that social narrative and organization is maximized. We have an in house development team that will be creating tools to push the boundaries of our global conversation. Everything we build will be open source and GNU (Creative Commons, MIT) to support the development open source problem solving.</p>
<h3>How does this change things?</h3>
<p>It makes it about the idea and not just about the people telling the story. How is this different than Occupy: Online higher fidelity not about the occupation of space but the occupation of our own mind. It is about humanity living up to our potential. About thinking instead of being afraid. It is about reason being greater than distraction. It is about the peace that can only come through contemplation and self examination. Occupy was about breaking down a broken system, we're about building a better replacement. What do you believe: We all have our own opinions but we represent a process of solving problems not a standpoint on political issues. making informed decisions. Participatory government that is held accountable to its people through transparency. I believe in freedom, and responsibility. It is time for humanity to grow up and build our future together. Everyone needs to be a part of building our world. What are you trying to accomplish: We are trying to unite the best intentions of the world through technology. We are a technological call to action. We need a conversation about our conversation. More than anything we are here for intelligent, honorable, just and noble results. We are here to win. We are here to make humanity a force of nature/evolution. Long story short our goal is the creation of a global project management tool set that allows for collaborative open source engineering as well as social debate and information management.</p>
<h3>How are you helping facilitate a more participatory government?</h3>
<p>We want the public to be more involved, but today much of the public is apathetic or uninformed on many issues. We are creating tools that compile all of the information related to a contentious subject in a single place. During this ongoing process, of hosting debate, the means by which users will add content to their debate will inherently add structure to it. This structure can be represented visually, and each debate becomes a referenceable destination that can be used to facilitate the process of ‘doing your own research’ on a contentious subject. At the moment the debates are only between the figureheads and there are many relevant conversations that are not mentioned or discussed. In this way we’re moving the discussion into a more public domain. we’re building an interface that can support billions of people having a complex conversation about extremely complex issues at the same time. We want the discussion to be between the people the best represent the ideas that they’re talking about and that know the most about what’s related to what they’re talking about, not just the people with the most money.</p>
<h3>What toys can be dreamed up to help reinforce discussion without dumbing it down?</h3>
<p>It is all about linked data and linked discussions. We need to stop repeating the same argument a million times and just have a centralized location for that argument. Semantic annotation is an integral part of our systems design. Users can also propose merging of arguments and will have a full set of version control options. Much like github. We are doing several things to insure logical consistency of arguments. The first is the use of semantic annotation to classify the quality of the argument. Once classified as a logical fallacy users on the system will up/down vote on the classification. Once we have more free time to increase our research efforts we will include our natural language processing and pretty much break it down into propositional calculus. Long term we would like to have the option of switching between natural language and logical formula much like wordpress lets you switch between WYSIWYG and HTML editing. The biggest upgrade will be the interface. It will allow you to see all sides of a developing debate in real-time as well as supporting or opposing data (videos, articles, raw scientific data) connected to the discussion. I love the idea of an overview of supporting/opposing submissions to a debate.</p>
<h3>How would you encourage/enforce submitters/contributors to meta-tag their contributions to enable these sortings of content for quantitative comparisons?</h3>
<p>That is the idea behind collective semantic annotation of arguments. It is essentially establishing the formula of a debate to classify and monitor all its attributes. We would know where it is, what it is and what it is about and who is developing it. This would really clear up allot of what is going on around a given topic. The submission interface itself would be part of this process, since many people 'believe' the same things, or say things in a similar way, a system that 'reads' what people are saying and overlaps that submission to similar posts would be an automatic meta-tagging of sorts. We're also integrating the interface with information that we can pull from APIs from open data initiatives worldwide.</p>
<h3>Do you want to ditch the upvote/downvote system?</h3>

<p>Yes</p>
<h3>How do you intend to build in troll/shill-proofing?</h3>
<p>By using semantics and applying analytics to user groups. When you can test the validity of information used to support positions and then use that as part of the rating. It becomes clear who is using bad intel and poor sources as that user reputation can be tied to the amount of valid sources he has attached to an argument point. Reputation is not flat. That data can be represented along the argument allowing a filter that demonstrates the more reliable opinions. A debate is not an island. It relies on other factors. When people start a debate they bring in information that has already been rated and vetted or they bring in new information that becomes vetted through the debate process. We also classify and organize the debates as a group and continue to keep them updated and relevant. This entire process rates the user and we get a much better picture of how reliable they are as users. This in turn helps us find reliable and important arguments. We are finding the ""experts"" and also analysing the form of a debate as a collective. We are planning to use a community vetting process, and yes there will be shills. So ban them from your community, or outvote them. It will be up to each community to weigh in on a given artifact that one of their debates references. If you don't like the job that your community is doing, leave it and find a smarter one. We will be associating and ranking all of the arguments from each community around a given artifact.</p>

We are a Non-Profit organization that advocates the responsible use of collective intelligence (CI) research. We need a way to talk as a species and makes sense of it all. There are so many great ideas that need to be heard. We are building a global information center and tool set dedicated to a better world through massive online collaboration, deliberation, project planning, research and the shared innovation.
We are diverse a group of individuals who have taken previous bodies of individual research and pooled them into one system; the tribeforth system. With diverse specializations from Military intelligence, Artificial intelligence, Political Science, Journalism and Marketing we have committed ourselves to developing the best system of conversation and argumentation modern technology can provide.  
FAQ
What is OpenThink Lab?
It is a first of its kind global crowdsourcing project. OpenThink Lab is designed to stimulate an international conversation about our society. The job of the Tribeforth Foundation is to provide and develop infrastructure for that conversation. We are creating a tool to facilitate understanding and collaborative problem solving
Doesn’t The Media Already Provide this Function?
Politifact has offered some transformative steps in real time fact checking. Our project goes beyond simply fact checking politicians but creates an environment in which entire arguments can be fact checked and developed. The debate held by the public, rather than exclusively by their officials.
What is Tribeforth's Involvement?
Our job is to ensure that the conversation continues and stays open source. We will be using social media analytics and as well as working with different media agencies in order to ensure that the conversation gets adequate coverage in new and conventional media. Our job is it ensure that social narrative and organization is maximized. We have an in house development team that will be creating tools to push the boundaries of our global conversation. Everything we build will be open source and GNU (Creative Commons, MIT) to support the development open source problem solving.
How does this change things?
It makes it about the idea and not just about the people telling the story. How is this different than Occupy: Online higher fidelity not about the occupation of space but the occupation of our own mind. It is about humanity living up to our potential. About thinking instead of being afraid. It is about reason being greater than distraction. It is about the peace that can only come through contemplation and self examination. Occupy was about breaking down a broken system, we're about building a better replacement. What do you believe: We all have our own opinions but we represent a process of solving problems not a standpoint on political issues. making informed decisions. Participatory government that is held accountable to its people through transparency. I believe in freedom, and responsibility. It is time for humanity to grow up and build our future together. Everyone needs to be a part of building our world. What are you trying to accomplish: We are trying to unite the best intentions of the world through technology. We are a technological call to action. We need a conversation about our conversation. More than anything we are here for intelligent, honorable, just and noble results. We are here to win. We are here to make humanity a force of nature/evolution. Long story short our goal is the creation of a global project management tool set that allows for collaborative open source engineering as well as social debate and information management.
How are you helping facilitate a more participatory government?
We want the public to be more involved, but today much of the public is apathetic or uninformed on many issues. We are creating tools that compile all of the information related to a contentious subject in a single place. During this ongoing process, of hosting debate, the means by which users will add content to their debate will inherently add structure to it. This structure can be represented visually, and each debate becomes a referenceable destination that can be used to facilitate the process of ‘doing your own research’ on a contentious subject. At the moment the debates are only between the figureheads and there are many relevant conversations that are not mentioned or discussed. In this way we’re moving the discussion into a more public domain. we’re building an interface that can support billions of people having a complex conversation about extremely complex issues at the same time. We want the discussion to be between the people the best represent the ideas that they’re talking about and that know the most about what’s related to what they’re talking about, not just the people with the most money.
What toys can be dreamed up to help reinforce discussion without dumbing it down?
It is all about linked data and linked discussions. We need to stop repeating the same argument a million times and just have a centralized location for that argument. Semantic annotation is an integral part of our systems design. Users can also propose merging of arguments and will have a full set of version control options. Much like github. We are doing several things to insure logical consistency of arguments. The first is the use of semantic annotation to classify the quality of the argument. Once classified as a logical fallacy users on the system will up/down vote on the classification. Once we have more free time to increase our research efforts we will include our natural language processing and pretty much break it down into propositional calculus. Long term we would like to have the option of switching between natural language and logical formula much like wordpress lets you switch between WYSIWYG and HTML editing. The biggest upgrade will be the interface. It will allow you to see all sides of a developing debate in real-time as well as supporting or opposing data (videos, articles, raw scientific data) connected to the discussion. I love the idea of an overview of supporting/opposing submissions to a debate.
How would you encourage/enforce submitters/contributors to meta-tag their contributions to enable these sortings of content for quantitative comparisons?
That is the idea behind collective semantic annotation of arguments. It is essentially establishing the formula of a debate to classify and monitor all its attributes. We would know where it is, what it is and what it is about and who is developing it. This would really clear up allot of what is going on around a given topic. The submission interface itself would be part of this process, since many people 'believe' the same things, or say things in a similar way, a system that 'reads' what people are saying and overlaps that submission to similar posts would be an automatic meta-tagging of sorts. We're also integrating the interface with information that we can pull from APIs from open data initiatives worldwide.
Do you want to ditch the upvote/downvote system?
Is there anything else that could highlight ""better"" branches of debate.” If you use up/downvote rating along with semantic annotation and classification of debates you will get progressively better data. The up/down dynamic is only poor when the platforms method for organizing and utilizing user submissions is flat. The real goal here is to map the arguments, capture the cited data in relation to them, and present a longer chain of assertions and debunkings than we presently ever hear about. But let me reiterate - we want to capture the argument itself. We want to store it and rank it. We want disputes to be highlighted, retained, and resolved not glossed over or unmentioned. We want transparency. We want to rank information, in multiple ways including a category for what scientific institutions think. We want to quantify a reputation ranking for those sources of information as artifacts are debunked over time. - We want to improve the amount and quality of information available for an informed electorate, to counteract the effects of monopolization in mainstream media.
Will accept anonymous submissions?
Yes
How do you intend to build in troll/shill-proofing?
By using semantics and applying analytics to user groups. When you can test the validity of information used to support positions and then use that as part of the rating. It becomes clear who is using bad intel and poor sources as that user reputation can be tied to the amount of valid sources he has attached to an argument point. Reputation is not flat. That data can be represented along the argument allowing a filter that demonstrates the more reliable opinions. A debate is not an island. It relies on other factors. When people start a debate they bring in information that has already been rated and vetted or they bring in new information that becomes vetted through the debate process. We also classify and organize the debates as a group and continue to keep them updated and relevant. This entire process rates the user and we get a much better picture of how reliable they are as users. This in turn helps us find reliable and important arguments. We are finding the ""experts"" and also analysing the form of a debate as a collective. We are planning to use a community vetting process, and yes there will be shills. So ban them from your community, or outvote them. It will be up to each community to weigh in on a given artifact that one of their debates references. If you don't like the job that your community is doing, leave it and find a smarter one. We will be associating and ranking all of the arguments from each community around a given artifact.

<p>We are a brand new start up business looking to help the environment by keeping it clean of all the pet waste left behind by people who do not take the time to pick up after their pets while walking them.</p>

<p><strong>3: </strong>Pet waste can infest your dog with parasites if he steps in it. The cycle can continue as long as there are feces in the dog's environment. Picking up dog poop prevents a great deal of potential contamination and re-contamination. By picking up the poop, you could avoid costly veterinary expenses and even save money on human doctor bills.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>4: </strong>Many cities have ordinances and laws in place that require dog owners to clean up their pet's poop. If you are caught not cleaning up after your dog, you may be forced to pay a penalty.</p>

I couldn't hold a job, I was generally homeless.  I went to rehab five times and was in and out of AA for years, desperate to quit.  When it was clear that there was no escape, I tried to drink myself to death.  But thank God He had another plan for me! A young lady found me passed out on a street corner, took me in, nursed me back to health, and took me to her church.  I got saved, and I have been clean and sober for seven years now, by the grace of God! He gave me a brand new life and I thank Him for that every day! Now I'm married (five years!) and I've had the same job for seven years.  I'm a strong, active member of my church, and my community! I've written and self published two books, something I used to dream of, but never thought possible for myself.  </p>
<p>Two years ago I had a new dream, to grow my hair long.  That might not sound major, but I'd had short, thin, unhealthy hair all my life, and I was ready for a change! I tried everything on the market, nothing worked.  I asked God to help me, and I started doing research.  I developed a scalp oil that grew my hair from shoulder length to grazing my waist in a year and a half, which is fast by any standards, but definitely fast for a slow growing, ethnic head of hair.  Not only that, it grew thick and healthy! Soon friends and family started noticing the crazy growth I was getting and asked what I was doing. When I told them, they started asking me to make some for them, which I did.  Soon the demand was so high, I had to start charging just to buy the ingredients.  As demand grew, my husband suggested I start selling online, which I did.  I currently sell it on Amazon.com and on my own website. </p>
<p>Recently my husband felt lead by the Lord to go into a beauty supply store and give the owner my card.  They began to talk, and the man said he wanted to meet me and discuss carrying my oil! We met and he is interested in carrying it in his MULTIPLE store locations! Woo hoo! Here's the only problem.  We cannot afford to manufacture the product to give him! I'm a waitress, and my husband recently got laid off.  The money we make from the oils covers the expense of making and shipping them right now, not much more.  The Lord has always made a way for us to survive, and continues to do so.  But we can't spare a dime for supplies.  We need ingredients, bottles, labels, etc.  </p>
<p>This is my dream, to help other women have the hair that they want! The Lord blessed me to discover an oil that truly works, and not just for me.  The first lady at my church was stricken with cancer.  She is in complete remission now, and has been for some time now, praise God! But she lost her hair to chemo and was forced to wear wigs. She is in her seventies (just turned 75) and had pretty much resigned herself to wigs from here on out.  But she heard about my oil and decided to try it.  Now, six months later, her hair is back longer and thicker than it was before.  No more wigs! I thank God that my oil can do this, and it has helped many others as well.   I call it Miracle Hair Growth Oil, because it has truly been a miracle.  </p>
<p>Now I'm asking YOU to be my miracle! Please help me to realize my dream of being a self-employed, hair product manufacturer! If you grab one of my exciting perks and donate to my Miracle Campaign, my husband and I will be able to place our oil in local beauty supply stores by spring! Being laid off has hit my husband especially hard and this will give him the employment and sense of purpose he seeks! We are partners in this, and this would be a dream come true for both of us! I would like to show young men and women who think that their life is hopeless, that their addictions, their demons, their obstacles will overwhelm them- I would like to show them that their life can turn around completely and that their dreams can come true! Please help me do that! </p>
<p>The deadline on this campaign is short, because the beauty supply man wants to act fast on this.  If we can't get ready in time, he won't take us seriously.  Please help us! Any amount will help, any amount at all! If you absolutely cannot donate, we understand.  Trust me, with my husband unemployed and me pushing burgers for tips- we totally understand.  But please help us by telling friends, family and coworkers who might be in a better position to contribute.  </p>
<p>Please be a part of our dream.  Be a part of a successful business starting on the ground level.  Be our miracle! And God bless you!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Candace True here, owner/baker at Cupcakes By Candie. Right now, I'm baking things using a hand mixer and it gets pretty tough trying to bake over 50 cupcakes without a larger bowl and stand mixer. Because I'm just in my starting phases of this whole situation I don't have much money, but I have the love and support of my wonderful boyfriend and my friends and family. I would love to, eventually, break off and possibly get my own store front, but that will come in due time.</p>
<p>With recent loses of friends and family, I started to feel really stressed and just not happy with work or much else. I now have a job that I love, but when I get stressed, I bake....a LOT (the people at work LOVE IT). I feel that if baking were my full-time gig, I would be pretty stress free and would just be happiest doing what I LOVE to do. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This is about my sister Mary Lou Mendez-Bayram and her husband Ferhat Bayram...In January 2001 we had our lives forever changed...it's kind of weird what led up to Monday, January 22, 2001...it all started that previous Sunday, January 14...my dad had talked to Lulu on the phone, who was living in Turkey with Ferhat (they got married there in '97 and he was pursuing his PhD and she was a teacher at a private school) and Lulu had told Daddy that she was going to wire him some money...on Tuesday Daddy received that money and he began to call her...he didn't reach her and didn't think much of it...on Wednesday he still could not reach her...on Thursday my parents started getting worried...they talked to me about it...I was so busy with my life of course and I was like okay, I will email her..which I did..no response...on Friday mom was talking to my sister about not being able to reach Lulu and that she was concerned that something was wrong...they were in the living room...and my mom's walls are full of pictures of us from just about every age....as my mom stated that she was concerned about Lulu, her baby picture fell from the wall to the floor...my mom immediately started praying...(i have a lump in my throat as I write this-i have told this story a million times and it still gets me)....the weekend went by with no word from Lulu....on Monday morning my parents came to my apartment around 8:30 and I could see the look of worry/concern on their faces...my dad was trying to be more brave than what he looked...they said Harlingen Police had gone by the house to give them a message from the US Embassy but that they tried calling the number and the call was not going through...I called my contact at HPD and was able to track down the info...apparently my sister and Ferhat had been found unconscious in their aparment...I called my work at the time and told them that I was going to be late because I had to get some info on my sister first...I never in a million years thought that I would be on a plan to Turkey that afternoon with my mom...we didnt' have the money!...we also received calls from her friends who were able to get ahold of us...they told us 'they are alive, but someone really needs to be here'....we were advised by the US Department that they would provide us with emergency passports...I went to the airport in Harlingen and inquired about the flights...was advised that it would be $3000 each roundtrip...i advised it was an emergency and not pleasure...it was still going to be $1500 each...we still didn't have the money...but mom had just received a credit card and she did not hesitate to use it...I remember going into the federal building in Houston to await our passports and watching the tv...the Texas 7 had just been caught...as I waited I could see mom praying...she was always praying...but I didn't think that it was that bad...I just assumed we are going to go get Lulu and come back asap...never in a million years did I expect to find them both in comas...gosh, it is just so much to write and I just don't know where to start again....</p>
<p>We got to Ankara, Turkey....the school where my sister worked sent a van and some of her friends to come for us...and so the adventure began...Turkish, to English to Spanish, back to English, and Turkish...it was crazy....we finally met Ferhat's dad ...I still remember him carrying our luggage...and being told that Ferhat had sufferred 2 heart attacks already...</p>
<p>We get to the hospital...and when I say I was amazed...I was AMAZED at the number of people who were there...for Ferhat and Lulu!...it was so nice to have so many people there in support of them...as we walked further into the room we were introduced to Ferhat's mom...she immediately hugged my mom and both began crying and embracing each other...right there and then I realized that TEARS have no language...it is the same for everyone...after meeting everyone we were led to a break room where the doctors there met with us...we were told that they were unconcsious but they couldn't tell us why or what happened...they were both found in their apartment on their beds...and gashes on their legs...there was vomit to the side of my sister, on the floor...this is what i saw when i walked into their apartment...we were led in to go see them...they were in a room with others around...we were told that they were 'unconcsious' and they had not had a response from them...my mom walked up to Lulu and held her hand and started talking to her like when she was a baby...Lulu's hand squeezed my mom's!...that was the first sign of movement Lulu had made!...as I write this my tears are flowing...I just can't forget all this that easily...I walked up to Ferhat and started telling him that we were there and things would be okay...</p>
<p>That's when we were told that the last time anyone had seen them was Saturday, and they were not found until Monday morning...they went to her apartment because Lulu didn't show up to work, and that was unlike her...the landlady opened the apartment and that is when they found them and she screamed they were dead...one of Lulu and Ferhat's friends walked up to them and realized they were breathing even though their eyes had already rolled to the back of their heads...they called for an ambulance...their friends tried so hard to find out what happened...even taking a sandwich that was found in their room to see if that could be the issue....their cat Smokey was found alive...(Smokey is back home with Lulu!) ....you know the funny thing about this whole situation is that this was the first night they were spending in the apartment...they were going to be moving over the weekend so they could save money since this apartment was owned by the school my sister taught at...TED college I believe was the name...she was frugal and she wanted to save rent...</p>
<p>That Sunday Ferhat's brother in law got worried when they weren't at their old apartment to meet the movers...he did everything he could to locate them...even as far as going to Lulu's school and trying to get their new address-which they would not give him...I always wonder, what if, they had just given him the address or if they had even bothered to go check on them themselves if they would be okay now...the brother in law drove around for hours trying to locate them...but didn't find them...their friends assumed they were with his family even though the car was parked outside...just so many what if's....and the reason that daddy couldn't get a hold of Lulu was because she had disconnected the phone to have it transferred...</p>
<p>I know that i am leaving so many things out, but I just can't write everything...all I know is that this was an awful experience...and I wouldn't wish it upon anybody...after a week in a half we were advised that there was a medical plane that would come get us...and for this the US had approved that Ferhat come with us as a courtesy to Lulu since she was an American Citizen...Ferhat was a Turkish citizen and didn't have a visa or passport...but our hearts got heavy when the doctor advised us the Ferhat had suffered another heart attack and it would be too dangerous to have him fly back with us...let me tell you that when the medical personnel from the plane arrived, it was like a scene out of a movie...it was crazy...so, i took a couple of minutes to go see Ferhat and say my goodbyes...I walked over to him and held his hand...and I told him that I was taking Lulu with me and that I promised him that I would bring her back as soon as she got better...Ferhat had not regained consciousness...and he never did...6 months later on his 30th birthday, July 22, 2001, he passed...I cried so much...I got a call from his friend to tell me that he had passed...i had to let my parents know...but I couldn't say it to Lulu...so we kept it from her...</p>
<p>Mom and I didn't use our return tickets so I just assumed there would be a credit...so my sister and I drove to San Antonio so that I could get a flight back to Turkey to be with Ferhat's family...I still remember getting there to United and the counter was closed, but three employees were coming out and I begged them to help me...one walked straight out, and another male told the female employee to just leave me, to 'come on'....that female employee saw my hurt and desperation in me...I explained my brother in law had died and I needed to get back to Turkey...but even with the ticket credit, I still had to pay over $1000...which I didn't have...she stayed to help us, and the other two employees just left...I didn't get her name, but at least she tried to help me...I left the airport with a big heavy heart...and as of today, I have not been able to go back at all...</p>
<p>I never thougth that going back to Turkey would be to Ferhat's grave...Lulu's belongings are still in Turkey...I haven't been able to get them...especially her wedding dress, I wish I could go back ....</p>

<p>The reason for me asking for donations is that I have done what I can with fundraisers locally, and knowing about this I thought that I could help my family even more....see, my mom is 83 and my aunt is 65 and they both care for my sister 24/7...my mom has given up her life and has been taking care of Lulu since then...Daddy passed in June 3, 2003 and he died never knowing what happened to Lulu...</p>
<p>I want to be able to use this money to help my mom with a new bathroom and to put a dryer in the home...(they still use a clothesline)...and my mom is up in age and I want to be able to send her to see her family in Mexico before she is unable to travel...but we need help in getting someone to come and help with my sister for a while...she does get a provider for 4 hours a day...but that is not enough for Lulu, she needs constant care...I just want to give my mom and aunt a break...it will be tough having them take a break, but that is the least that I can do for them...</p>
<p>I have tried contacting news outlets to no avail...so, my last hope is with you...anything that you can help out with will be greatly appreciated...my mom and aunt more than anybody else know what Lulu needs...they will in turn say that they themselved don't need anything...just so you know that I am being honest, I will provide you with my sister's info:</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
This is about my sister Mary Lou Mendez-Bayram and her husband Ferhat Bayram...In January 2001 we had our lives forever changed...it's kind of weird what led up to Monday, January 22, 2001...it all started that previous Sunday, January 14...my dad had talked to Lulu on the phone, who was living in Turkey with Ferhat (they got married there in '97 and he was pursuing his PhD and she was a teacher at a private school) and Lulu had told Daddy that she was going to wire him some money...on Tuesday Daddy received that money and he began to call her...he didn't reach her and didn't think much of it...on Wednesday he still could not reach her...on Thursday my parents started getting worried...they talked to me about it...I was so busy with my life of course and I was like okay, I will email her..which I did..no response...on Friday mom was talking to my sister about not being able to reach Lulu and that she was concerned that something was wrong...they were in the living room...and my mom's walls are full of pictures of us from just about every age....as my mom stated that she was concerned about Lulu, her baby picture fell from the wall to the floor...my mom immediately started praying...(i have a lump in my throat as I write this-i have told this story a million times and it still gets me)....the weekend went by with no word from Lulu....on Monday morning my parents came to my apartment around 8:30 and I could see the look of worry/concern on their faces...my dad was trying to be more brave than what he looked...they said Harlingen Police had gone by the house to give them a message from the US Embassy but that they tried calling the number and the call was not going through...I called my contact at HPD and was able to track down the info...apparently my sister and Ferhat had been found unconscious in their aparment...I called my work at the time and told them that I was going to be late because I had to get some info on my sister first...I never in a million years thought that I would be on a plan to Turkey that afternoon with my mom...we didnt' have the money!...we also received calls from her friends who were able to get ahold of us...they told us 'they are alive, but someone really needs to be here'....we were advised by the US Department that they would provide us with emergency passports...I went to the airport in Harlingen and inquired about the flights...was advised that it would be $3000 each roundtrip...i advised it was an emergency and not pleasure...it was still going to be $1500 each...we still didn't have the money...but mom had just received a credit card and she did not hesitate to use it...I remember going into the federal building in Houston to await our passports and watching the tv...the Texas 7 had just been caught...as I waited I could see mom praying...she was always praying...but I didn't think that it was that bad...I just assumed we are going to go get Lulu and come back asap...never in a million years did I expect to find them both in comas...gosh, it is just so much to write and I just don't know where to start again....
We got to Ankara, Turkey....the school where my sister worked sent a van and some of her friends to come for us...and so the adventure began...Turkish, to English to Spanish, back to English, and Turkish...it was crazy....we finally met Ferhat's dad ...I still remember him carrying our luggage...and being told that Ferhat had sufferred 2 heart attacks already...
We get to the hospital...and when I say I was amazed...I was AMAZED at the number of people who were there...for Ferhat and Lulu!...it was so nice to have so many people there in support of them...as we walked further into the room we were introduced to Ferhat's mom...she immediately hugged my mom and both began crying and embracing each other...right there and then I realized that TEARS have no language...it is the same for everyone...after meeting everyone we were led to a break room where the doctors there met with us...we were told that they were unconcsious but they couldn't tell us why or what happened...they were both found in their apartment on their beds...and gashes on their legs...there was vomit to the side of my sister, on the floor...this is what i saw when i walked into their apartment...we were led in to go see them...they were in a room with others around...we were told that they were 'unconcsious' and they had not had a response from them...my mom walked up to Lulu and held her hand and started talking to her like when she was a baby...Lulu's hand squeezed my mom's!...that was the first sign of movement Lulu had made!...as I write this my tears are flowing...I just can't forget all this that easily...I walked up to Ferhat and started telling him that we were there and things would be okay...
That's when we were told that the last time anyone had seen them was Saturday, and they were not found until Monday morning...they went to her apartment because Lulu didn't show up to work, and that was unlike her...the landlady opened the apartment and that is when they found them and she screamed they were dead...one of Lulu and Ferhat's friends walked up to them and realized they were breathing even though their eyes had already rolled to the back of their heads...they called for an ambulance...their friends tried so hard to find out what happened...even taking a sandwich that was found in their room to see if that could be the issue....their cat Smokey was found alive...(Smokey is back home with Lulu!) ....you know the funny thing about this whole situation is that this was the first night they were spending in the apartment...they were going to be moving over the weekend so they could save money since this apartment was owned by the school my sister taught at...TED college I believe was the name...she was frugal and she wanted to save rent...

<h3><strong>Our Intention</strong></h3>
<p>We don’t need to tell you that East Side Yoga is a pretty special yoga studio.  As a student, teacher or friend of ESY, you already know that.  It’s the beautiful and peaceful space, amazing staff, awesome classes, workshops and special programs (many of them free), and just fact that the owners know you by name.  You feel the love and intention that Steven and Elsa have devoted to giving everyone who walks in the door <em>the</em> best yoga experience they possibly can.  How lucky we are to be a part of this community!</p>
<p>We, the students, teachers and friends of Eastside, are having this fundraiser in order to give back to are beloved studio. ESY has developed into a wonderful community in just over 2 years, and now it is time to help ESY get more eco-friendly, organized and cost-effective.  We all want ESY to thrive and grow for many years to come!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Goals</h3>
<p>As soon as you walk in the door at ESY, you feel Steven and Elsa's vision and commitment.  Eastside Yoga offers us all a place to grow, experience and work towards reaching our full potential through self-discovery, practice, and study. We want ESY to reach it's fullest potential as well. We are passionate about what Eastside offers us and want to give back!  </p>
<p>The money we raise for Eastside will help the studio to be more eco-friendly, cost- effective and organized. The two main goals for this fundraiser are:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Insulate the studio.</strong> This will provide better sound-proofing and cut the cost of ESY's energy bills. ESY will use recycled denim for the insulation. This will create a more peaceful class environment while cutting down on resources to heat and cool the studio.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Build a stable reception desk that will help to make check-in and administrative work more organized and efficient.</strong> This will also be done with recycled materials. This will enhance the overall experience at ESY, from the moment you check in to the moment you leave the studio.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you share our love for ESY you can help us by contributing to our fund! Many of the teachers, students and friends have come together to offer various incentives. You can help ESY grow, and be recognized for your donation.  When the project is complete, all contributors will be invited to a gathering to celebrate.  If you have ever been to an ESY gathering, you know you do not want to miss it.  Please see the other incentives for donations at all levels.  Thank you so much for your support!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This is Samer Bechara. My village consists of around 1,000 people. Only 100 of those people live in the village. Others are scattered around the globe, in countries such as Venezuela, Canada, Australia, USA...</p>
<p>In 2004, I created a website to connect those people. The website served the needs of everyone very well, but became very inactive after Facebook started getting popular in 2008. </p>
<p>I have just relaunched a <a href=""http://arbet-kozhaya.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a> for my village right now, which takes use of new technology as follows:</p>

<h3>What is Motivolog.com?</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Gökhan Sezginer and I am co-founder of Motivolog.com. I am a Biomedical Engineer and have MSc. degree in Medical Informatics.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">4 years ago I was diagnosed for a chronic illness and after my doctor visit I started to Google it. During my research I have realized that there were lots of patient blogs which were sharing their experiences about that disease but they were in English. At that time there were no platforms for patients in Turkish so I started to think about creating a patient network to help patients whose native language is Turkish.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I have quit my job last summer, which I was working for 4 years, and started to work on Motivolog.com. 3 months ago we have launched the network. The initial impact was great from the Turkish patient community. </span><br/></p>

<h3>Our Mission</h3>
Healthy parental connections are essential to a child's development. Children are the silent victims of their parent's crime through the trauma and loss of the environment that has been their life. When a child's parent is incarcerated and a healthy connection is maintained, it reduces the child's risk for social, emotional, and educational problems. For the incarcerated parent, family connection decreases the likelihood of recidivism. Maintaining and enhancing the bond between the child and the incarcerated parent through video messages and other interactive media are the focal points of The Messages Project.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Since 1999, the Messages Project has visited state prisons across the United States several times a year to create more than 9,000 messages (videotapes or DVDs) from incarcerated parents to their kids. The recordings are mailed home to children and families, often with a book that was read as part of the message.</div>
<div>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
With the help of the Jacaranda Foundation and School for Orphans in Malawi, The Messages Project is going international for the first time in August! By expanding our program to assist children of incarcerated parents in Africa, we hope to bring further awareness to the global issue of the children left behind when a parent is imprisoned.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But we need your help! The cost to produce the average message is about $15 (for materials and postage). Our trip to Malawi will incur additional costs, including travel expenses and compensating for the scarcity of power sources. To make our trip as successful as possible, we need to ensure we have enough volunteers onsite and enough materials to help as many children as possible.</div>
<div>
<h3>We Make a Difference</h3>
</div>
<div>Our organization has been proven to enhance the lives of children affected by parental incarceration. These kids are less likely to later become involved in the criminal justice system themselves, and their parents are less likely to reoffend after their release from prison. We've received numerous compliments from participants, such as the following.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“I am 17-years-old and when my dad went to prison, I was sad and depressed. I haven’t seen him in a long time. When the DVD message and book arrived, I was emotional, but happy that I could see my dad. It felt like we were in the same room together. I really value the fact that I was able to see my dad and know he is okay and thinking about me daily. He looked good and I was able to see that myself. This is a great program!”<br/> ~A Message Recipient</div>

<ul>
<li>Brown Truss Type Covered Bridge.</li>
<li>Built in 1867</li>
<li>Was the oldest operational covered bridge in Michigan that still carried vehicle traffic.</li>
<li>Destroyed by arson on July 7, 2013.</li>
<li>100% Disabled Veteran leading rebuilding effort.</li>
</ul></span></span><span class=""notranlsate""></span><h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Whites Covered Bridge stood for over 146 years, providing a vital transportation link, a picturesque setting, and great historical value to Ionia County, Michigan. On July 7, 2013 the bridge was destroyed by arson. At that time, the bridge was the oldest covered bridge in use in Michigan.</p>
<p>Within days, our group, Friends Rebuilding Whites Bridge was formed to make sure that our covered bridge gets rebuilt. What started as a group of strangers has evolved into a group of friends with the common goal of seeing this bridge rebuilt.</p>
<p>Our group came out swinging and quickly got Governor Rick Snyder, the Ionia County Road Commission and the township that the bridge stood in our our side as partners in the rebuilding effort. We also acted quickly as a group and organized a recovery effort of the remains of the old bridge using volunteer labor and machinery along with donated fuel for the excavator and trucks, and removed the remains from the river not only stopping the debris from further polluting the river, but saving the taxpayers of Ionia County, Michigan over $40,000.00. Without our intervention, the debris would still be in the river because the county did not have the money to remove it.</p>
<h3>What It Will Cost</h3>
<p>Bridges aren't Cheap! The estimated cost to build a replica bridge is in the neighborhood of $350,000-$450,000.00 down from the intial estimate from the county, which includes the cost of all materials and labor. This cost estimate was derived from the Project Engineer who rebuilt the Ada, Michigan covered bridge that was destroyed by fire in 1979. He has come on board with us and has been instrumental in furthering our cause, he also brings experience that few people will ever possess, the experience of already rebuilding a covered bridge.</p>
<p>We have partnered with the Fallasberg Historical Society, who now has the oldest covered bridge in Michigan open for traffic, to be our Fiscal Sponsor. Their beautiful covered is located just a few miles upstream from where Whites Bridge stood so they have a vetted interest in our effort. They will maintain all the funds raised through this campaign and when we have raised the money, they will turn the money over to Keene Township so that they can enter into a contract with the county to replace the bridge.</p>
<p>All money raised for the rebuilding of the bridge will go for just that, the rebuilding. If for some reason the bridge can't be rebuilt, the money will stay with Keene Township who will use the money to fund programs for the citizens of the township.</p>
<h3>  Why Should You Donate to Us</h3>
<p>Covered bridges are cool. No, really, you should contribute because this bridge has impacts outside of the local area. Whites Bridge is a popular spot for photos; it is part of covered bridge tours, and bicycle tour routes.

<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Our Bridge

Brown Truss Type Covered Bridge.
Built in 1867
Was the oldest operational covered bridge in Michigan that still carried vehicle traffic.
Destroyed by arson on July 7, 2013.
100% Disabled Veteran leading rebuilding effort.
Who We Are
Whites Covered Bridge stood for over 146 years, providing a vital transportation link, a picturesque setting, and great historical value to Ionia County, Michigan. On July 7, 2013 the bridge was destroyed by arson. At that time, the bridge was the oldest covered bridge in use in Michigan.
Within days, our group, Friends Rebuilding Whites Bridge was formed to make sure that our covered bridge gets rebuilt. What started as a group of strangers has evolved into a group of friends with the common goal of seeing this bridge rebuilt.
Our group came out swinging and quickly got Governor Rick Snyder, the Ionia County Road Commission and the township that the bridge stood in our our side as partners in the rebuilding effort. We also acted quickly as a group and organized a recovery effort of the remains of the old bridge using volunteer labor and machinery along with donated fuel for the excavator and trucks, and removed the remains from the river not only stopping the debris from further polluting the river, but saving the taxpayers of Ionia County, Michigan over $40,000.00. Without our intervention, the debris would still be in the river because the county did not have the money to remove it.
What It Will Cost
Bridges aren't Cheap! The estimated cost to build a replica bridge is in the neighborhood of $350,000-$450,000.00 down from the intial estimate from the county, which includes the cost of all materials and labor. This cost estimate was derived from the Project Engineer who rebuilt the Ada, Michigan covered bridge that was destroyed by fire in 1979. He has come on board with us and has been instrumental in furthering our cause, he also brings experience that few people will ever possess, the experience of already rebuilding a covered bridge.
We have partnered with the Fallasberg Historical Society, who now has the oldest covered bridge in Michigan open for traffic, to be our Fiscal Sponsor. Their beautiful covered is located just a few miles upstream from where Whites Bridge stood so they have a vetted interest in our effort. They will maintain all the funds raised through this campaign and when we have raised the money, they will turn the money over to Keene Township so that they can enter into a contract with the county to replace the bridge.
All money raised for the rebuilding of the bridge will go for just that, the rebuilding. If for some reason the bridge can't be rebuilt, the money will stay with Keene Township who will use the money to fund programs for the citizens of the township.
  Why Should You Donate to Us
Covered bridges are cool. No, really, you should contribute because this bridge has impacts outside of the local area. Whites Bridge is a popular spot for photos; it is part of covered bridge tours, and bicycle tour routes. The bridge also held a lot of history, it was a place where you could go and actually see and feel the spot where your long deceased relatives signed their names. I know my Great Grandparents, Grandparents, Mother, Father and myself and my children all signed our names in the old bridge and even though we lost history in the old bridge, the new one will be a clean slate for the current and future generations to sign.
Although 146 years of history have been destroyed, it is not forgotten and rebuilding the bridge will keep the person who burned it down the satisfaction of knowing that they succeeded. They will see that in the end that the ""Phoenix"" will rise and that good always trumps evil.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3 id=""yui_3_7_2_27_1372318964257_60"">Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Eric Shepherd and I am a student of the sarangi player Zohaib Hassan.  Along with fellow students, I'm looking to raise money and awareness about Zohaib Hassan's recent housing situation.</p>
<p>Recently Zohaib and his family were unfairly kicked out of their own home by their landlord who does not tolerate music. The landlord also kept raising the rent until finally kicking them out. This campaign is dedicated to help Zohaib and his family afford a home in a different neighborhood where he can be free to practice, perform, and teach sarangi.  <span>Zohaib Hassan is one of the most kind, humble people I know, this should not be happening to him. Right now Zohaib and his family are temporarily staying with a family member, but it's a situation that's not at all practical, and can't last long.</span></p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign you will allow Zohaib to afford to move to a safe area where he can make a safe and decent living as a musician, in doing so you'll be helping to keep alive Zohaib's musical family tradition of 5 generations. This is a very valuable part of Pakistan's musical cultural heritage.  Contributors are directly involved in preserving this heritage for generations to come. </p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise at least $2700 that will go to Zohaib Hassan so that he and his family can lease a house where he can practice sarangi and also teach students online without being persecuted and discriminated against. The cost of a 3-5 year lease in a decent neighborhood in or near Lahore Pakistan would cost Zohaib about $5000 total, and we have already gathered $2500 on our own, but we need the public's help to reach our final goal plus campaign fees.  </p>
<p>Perks range from a thank you from Zohaib, to you, the donor deciding one of the pieces of music to be recorded on his upcoming solo sarangi CD/download release.</p>
<p>If the entire goal is not reached then any portion gathered will go to Zohaib and his family and saved for when they finally have enough money to buy a 3-5 year home lease.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This fundraiser is important because it allows Zohaib to carry on his family's unique musical tradition. Getting the help he needs will greatly impact his life, Zohiab had polio when he was 4 years old, as a result he was left partially paralyzed, so music is Zohaib's life, he used to practice sarangi for over 8 hours a day before his landlord forbade it, being able to move into a stable housing situation will give Zohaib the chance to be the best he can be. </p>

<h3>Soap for Hope: Grief Relief Project</h3>
<p>There's not much that can compare the depth of pain one feels after the unexpected death of a love one. It's a pain I've witness paralyze family and friends time and time again while working as a Police Sergent and Ordained Minister for the last 30 years. Now I've retired from police work, I'm still affected by the numerous funeral donation car washes many families are forced to do to raise money for the unexpected burial of an infant/child, a young teen or a poor mother.</p>
<p>Out of wanting to do something to contribute to these families, an idea came to me to get communities involved and support families during these tragic times. I am a leader in an organization called Just Cause Fundraising (JustCauseFundraising.com). We provide Premium Laundry Detergents to be sold by non-profits, schools, churches etc., to raise money for their just cause purposes. My idea is to begin an ongoing fundraiser initiated by the indiegogo community and supported by the local communities to help families with funeral expenses. Hence, Soap for Hope: Grief Relief Project.</p>
<p>We will provide our Rain cycle Premium Laundry Detergent for purchase by the community with all proceeds being given to families conducting funeral donation car washes. Can you imagine the spiritual uplift the families will experience after receiving $100-$500 car wash donation.</p>
<p><b>What You Give and What you Will Receive</b></p>
<p>We are in need of the funds to kick start our Grief Relief Project in both Phoenix, Arizona and Indianapolis, Indiana. We will purchase 2 pallets (160 units) of our Rain Cycle Laundry Detergent (Specially labeled Soap for Hope). Once we receive the units, we will announce our campaign through social media and community newspaper and radio encouraging people to purchase the laundry Detergent to contribute to families conducting funeral donation car washes. Once again, all proceeds will go to the needy families and we will restock for continual operation. Our goal is to get communities everywhere involved.</p>
<p>Besides the heart warming feeling you will have knowing that you are affecting the lives of various families, I have listed some perks that I feel will keep you close to the vibrations of our efforts.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Although we will not be able to fully fund funerals, our collective assistance to the families will be received with tremendous grace and many spirits will be uplifted during these tragic moments. Hopefully with our gift, we will be able to convince assisted families to help the next family in need within the community.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Please help get the word out by ""Liking us"" on Facebook (facebook.com/JustCauseFundraising) where we will be talking a lot about this campaign and thanking each contributor. Also share what you have read here. Make use of the indiegogo tools. Thanks you for your interest!<br/></p>

<h3>My name is Brigitte Lewis, and Spirit Bridge is a company I founded to help marginalized communities find their core strength.  By doing this, each community (whether it be geographic or organizational) can build, fight, and grow in a sustainable, self-sufficient way.</h3>
<p>I have worked in a wide range of industries and settings.  Legal/Governance, Labour/Union, Finance/Insurance, Oil/Fossil Fuel, and (most recently) Federal Government.  My formal education has been in the areas of  Natural Science, Engineering and Economics.  My informal education reflects a similarly wide range of subject areas to my career path to-date.</p>
<p>Early in 2013 I voluntarily left the Federal Government to take a more hands-on approach to community development.  The constraints of public service, and politics, were preventing what I saw as necessary, urgent action to make this country a safe, prosperous (and most importantly) respectful place to live.</p>
<p>I try to provide free services to any community or not-for-profit in need.  Unfortunately I don't have the means to provide free services where travel is required.  I have to ask communities to pay for my transportation.  I am always willing to minimize costs by couch-surfing, pitching a tent, or staying at the least expensive commercial accommodations available.  Even this, however, is often cost-prohibitive for the communities most in need.</p>
<p>The most vulnerable communities are often the same ones on the front line of controversial natural resource extraction projects, and other threats to North American land and waters.  Helping them build their strength to facilitate meaningful, informed negotiation and discussion, is vital for the health and well being of our economy and all people.</p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></h3>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>What I am asking for here, is funding to provide strength-based development services to four communities most in need of assistance, in places I have to travel to get to.  Including flight, accommodations, and materials, each activity would cost roughly $2,500.  (4x$2,500 = $10,000)</p>
<p>What you get:</p>
<p>a $10 contribution will get you an exclusive photo from the community activity (the photo will be yours alone, and will not be among those shared on our website or through social media)</p>
<p>Contributions of $25 or more will also receive a custom made (handmade) iPad/tablet sleeve (see campaign photos for examples).  Contact me with any colour preference.</p>
<p>a $25 contribution will get you the exclusive photo, and a first-hand account of the activity (likewise, exclusive to you only and not otherwise shared).</p>
<p>a $50 contribution will get you the photo, first-hand account, and the opportunity to nominate a community/organization for consideration as one of the four</p>
<p>a $100 contribution will get you the photo, first-hand account, nomination and the opportunity to review and provide feedback on the short-list of potential communities/organizations</p>
<p>a $500 contribution will get you the photo, first-hand account, nomination, review/feedback opportunity as well as recognition on-site (signage, mention in the materials) and in all website or social media sharing of activity information before and after the activity.</p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">The Impact</span></h3>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>As a project funder/facilitator with the Federal Government, I was witness to so many instances of short-sighted consulting and project development among marginalized communities.</p>
<p>Consultants, collecting huge fees, doing borderline work and leaving the community no better off, with plans and commitments that were unsustainable without further reliance on outside sources of services and funding.</p>
<p>Spirit Bridge is different.  It is different by design.  Our work balances consultation with training so that when we are done, the community/organization is left with skills, strength, and strategies that they need to continue to build on without us (or anyone else).  Self-reliance is the answer.  Strength is the instrument of positive change.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please share the information about our work with your friends, colleagues and business network.  Tell them what we are trying to accomplish, and let them know we can help ANY group address ANY challenges with strength and self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>Our services are as effective to improving the bottom line of a business, as they are to improving outcomes for marginalized communities.  Another way you can help is by hiring us for your group.  You'll get the benefit of our services, and a portion of our fee always goes to funding our free endeavours for those who are unable to pay.</p>
<h3>Our Bottom Line</h3>
<p>Any money raised, even if we don't reach our goal, will go directly toward providing services to marginalized communities.  If we can't travel to reach them, we'll work in our own area to bring strength-based positive change to those who most need it.  Every dollar will count.  Every dollar will make a difference.</p>

<h3></h3>
<p><span>Hello, my name is Kelvin Brown, and I own and operate <b>Muskogee Directory</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>You may not know me but if you live in Muskogee, it is highly
likely that you have seen my work. 
Primarily, I promote Muskogee, through pictures, using several different
media channels, including MuskogeeDirectory.com, as well as social media sites;
Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and others.  Also, for the last few months, through a
weekly section in the Muskogee Phoenix, called <b>Around Town</b>, which features 20 to 30 pictures that I take at varying
events around the city.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>As the name suggest, Muskogee Directory, is a directory
listing hundreds of businesses in the Muskogee area.  Listing everything from places to eat, sleep
and play to large and small events.  This
is an attempt to raise funds to take Muskogee Directory to the next level, in its
ability to serve Muskogee. </span></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><span>STOP:</span></b><span>  I have read enough, how can I help?</span></p>
<p><span>Just look at the perks on the right side and decide at what
level you would like to participate. Then tell your friends.</span></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><span>I NEED MORE:</span></b><span>  In that case continue reading. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Why have you been asked to visit this page?  </span></p>
<p><span>Because the world is going mobile, and Muskogee Directory has
started to go mobile. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>In August of 2012 I began researching what it would take to
make information about the city of Muskogee mobile ready, and how to expand
Muskogee Directory to accomplish this.  </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><span>Phase one</span></b><span>,  was understanding the mobile market.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Phase two</span></b><span>, was
testing and consumer feedback.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Phase three</span></b><span>, was
getting the app accepted by Apple/Iphone and Google Android.</span></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><span>Where are we now?</span></b></p>
<p><span>The app has been approved; it is online and active on approximately
275 phones. With approximately, 300 business listing in the database. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The next step is <b>phase
four</b>:  Depending on which sources you
use, Muskogee, Oklahoma supports 1,200 to 1,400 businesses.  To make the app truly, a useful resource,
then at least 90% of those businesses needs to be included in the app.  Each listing should carry a minimum of
business name, address, and phone number. 
With the exception of some home based business that would rather not
give a home address.  Also the app will
list a full and active events calendar. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The goal is to have the app fully ready to be useful for the
2013 holiday shopping season. Through the app some of the information shared
will be, where the best deals are, holiday hours, and who has the last great
Christmas gift in stock and more.</span></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><span>Now the problem
or the issue before us.</span></b><span>  Cost. 
To get this done in the next 45 days is going to take time and
money.  Both of which are in short
supply.  </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The goal of this fundraising quest is to raise $3,200.  This will cover the cost of a local
contractor to expedite data entry, new equipment to take better pictures, and
an upgrade to the mobile software.  </span></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p></p>

<p></p></span></span></span></span></div>","Hello, my name is Kelvin Brown, and I own and operate Muskogee Directory.
You may not know me but if you live in Muskogee, it is highly
likely that you have seen my work. 
Primarily, I promote Muskogee, through pictures, using several different
media channels, including MuskogeeDirectory.com, as well as social media sites;
Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and others.  Also, for the last few months, through a
weekly section in the Muskogee Phoenix, called Around Town, which features 20 to 30 pictures that I take at varying
events around the city.

As the name suggest, Muskogee Directory, is a directory
listing hundreds of businesses in the Muskogee area.  Listing everything from places to eat, sleep
and play to large and small events.  This
is an attempt to raise funds to take Muskogee Directory to the next level, in its
ability to serve Muskogee. 


STOP:  I have read enough, how can I help?
Just look at the perks on the right side and decide at what
level you would like to participate. Then tell your friends.


I NEED MORE:  In that case continue reading. 

Why have you been asked to visit this page?  
Because the world is going mobile, and Muskogee Directory has
started to go mobile. 

In August of 2012 I began researching what it would take to
make information about the city of Muskogee mobile ready, and how to expand
Muskogee Directory to accomplish this.  

Phase one,  was understanding the mobile market.
Phase two, was
testing and consumer feedback.
Phase three, was
getting the app accepted by Apple/Iphone and Google Android.


Where are we now?
The app has been approved; it is online and active on approximately
275 phones. With approximately, 300 business listing in the database. 

The next step is phase
four:  Depending on which sources you
use, Muskogee, Oklahoma supports 1,200 to 1,400 businesses.  To make the app truly, a useful resource,
then at least 90% of those businesses needs to be included in the app.  Each listing should carry a minimum of
business name, address, and phone number. 
With the exception of some home based business that would rather not
give a home address.  Also the app will
list a full and active events calendar. 

The goal is to have the app fully ready to be useful for the
2013 holiday shopping season. Through the app some of the information shared
will be, where the best deals are, holiday hours, and who has the last great
Christmas gift in stock and more.


Now the problem
or the issue before us.  Cost. 
To get this done in the next 45 days is going to take time and
money.  Both of which are in short
supply.  

The goal of this fundraising quest is to raise $3,200.  This will cover the cost of a local
contractor to expedite data entry, new equipment to take better pictures, and
an upgrade to the mobile software.  



This is not
charity:  

I am not a non-profit agency, so I am not just asking you to
give for the sake of giving.  In the case
of businesses that are looking for addition advertising, promotion and
marketing, you can choose to participate at the business levels beginning at
$100.


What do you get
for $100?  Your
plain listing which is free is upgraded to the first level, which includes your
logo, website and social links.  This
promotion is good through the end of 2014. 
The normal cost would be over $300. 
Plus, you get the benefit of being first in, which means your business
gets addition exposure.

To the right of the page are the additional levels. 

If you just like the services that Muskogee Directory
provides and want to see it expand and offer more, your support would be
greatly appreciated.  The consumer levels
start at $1, just to be involved.  At
$10, you get recognition on our virtual brick wall.  With $20, you get pictures of yourself or

<p>For the last four years I have worked on and off for a Vancouver-based organization called Lookout Emergency Aid Society. </p>
<p>Indulge me, poets. Please lend me a minute to tell you about their absolutely incredible work. </p>
<p>Lookout started about 40 years ago, when a couple of socially minded folks began to notice the presence of adults on the streets and shores of our pretty city. People who had nowhere safe to lay their heads. We know now that there are thousands and thousands of people in Vancouver who - every single night - don’t have somewhere to call home. And we know that the number one cause of homelessness in our country is poverty and poverty alone. Lookout sees it constantly.

<p>And on a more personal note, this is something that is not lost on musicians. I know no shortage of people who have encountered these difficult situations. But it’s not just relegated to the small-time: Kurt Cobain; Jim Morrison; Ella Fitzgerald; Jennifer Lopez; Jewel; Beck; Patti Smith; Shania Twain. The list is not short. People - wealthy people - that you encounter in popular culture every day - have struggled with homelessness in pursuit of their dreams. Illness, crumbling economies, addiction, and difficult times strike people of every social strata. In my work with Lookout I have met successful athletes, former millionaires, lawyers, Wall Street traders, incredibly talented musicians and poets; and hundreds of very, very normal people who have needed assistance. I have also met many people with stories from the other end of the spectrum. People who have encountered and survived situations that you and I couldn’t have lasted a week in: Abuse; injury; death of loved ones; manipulative landlords; family tragedy; and on and on. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>Let’s support them.

been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder and other learning disabilities,
was invited to a party.  Aaron had been
to this home before and knew the family. 
The two adults in the home bought alcohol for the teens.  After drinking whiskey Aaron felt ill and
laid down on the floor.  He woke up when
the group told him to go outside and fight Blake Campbell, 17, whose main intention of going to the party that evening was to fight with Aaron Hill.   Aaron refused to go outside and asked the people in the house to call his Mom but they did not do that!  18 yr. old Andrew Wheeler was then called into the house.  While Aaron was sitting on the floor, curled
up, with his hands trying to protect his head Andrew Wheeler proceeded to beat
Aaron while a friend videotaped the event on his phone.  The graphic, disturbing and horrifying video
was uploaded to Facebook and has since gone viral!  Andrew Wheeler kneed Aaron Hill repeatedly in
the face and head.  He pulled Aaron by his
hair to the center of the floor and while pulling his hair he repeatedly punched him in the back of the head and neck.  After getting up from the floor,Aaron stumbled outside where Wheeler proceeded to choke him until he passed
out.  Aaron woke up while being beaten by Wheeler as
others stood around in a circle and laughed. 
Wheeler held a knife to Aaron’s throat and told him he was going to kill
him, he also punched him and kicked him repeatedly. 
Aaron was able to get to the front door of the house and finally the
adult stopped the fight but told him to leave, on his own, walking! Andrew Wheeler forced Aaron to start walking and he walked until he could walk no further and passed out in the middle of the road.    A woman driving by noticed a young man lying
in the middle of the road and called 911.  She shone her lights on Aarons body so that no other vehicles would be able to hit him! The young woman reported that Aaron was coughing, crying, moaning and he was very scared!  Police and EMS arrived and took Aaron to the hospital.  Aaron sustained marks and bruising to his
head, abdomen, chest and arms. He had a sprained neck, facial and scalp
contusions and a concussion.  Not to
mention the deep and lasting psychological damage that this has caused
him.  The video of this beating  has
gained worldwide attention because of the cruelty of the attack on this
defenseless boy!  Andrew Wheeler, 18,  has
been charged with aggravated child abuse and child abuse and Evadean Lyedecker, 40, one of the adults in the home, has also been charged
with aggravated child abuse, child neglect, allowing an open house party in her home and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.   On September 18, 2014 three more arrests were made in this case.  Blake Campbell, 17, who videotaped the incident has been charged with principal to first-degree child abuse and cyberstalking/bullying.  Brandie Dailey, 16,  who invited Aaron to the party and called on Wheeler to get him out of the house by telling Wheeler that Aaron had pushed and hit Daileys  sister has been charged with principal to child abuse as she watched the attack and did not seek help.  Keith Carnley Sr., 42 has been charged with delinquency to a minor. </span></p>
<p> Aarons' family started ‘Justice For
Aaron’ on the web and has held several rally’s for this cause.  Thousands of people as well as celebrities,
Montel Williams (talk show host), Aaron Paul (Breaking Bad) and others have
taken a strong role in this attack and are showing support and outrage.  Aaron Paul opened his house to Aaron and his
family to get them away from it all and even offered a day at Disney World just
to try to put a smile on this young man’s face. 
Aaron has not been able to attend his local high school as the school
district cannot provide protection to him from possible fallout from other
friends of the attackers.  Several people
have gotten together to help Aaron gain his smile back and what a beautiful
smile it is!  They are reaching out to
others to help along the way!  The Hill
family now has a spokesperson that single-handedly gained Aarons' trust and is
showing him that the World is a better place with him smiling again!  Three individuals worked hard together to
gather funds to help Aaron and with a show of support from local businesses
Aaron is on his way to recovery both mentally and emotionally.  However the Hill family is struggling with
much more! </p>
<p> Lesley Hill is a single Mom raising
five children.  Two of them are on the
Autism Spectrum Scale.  With one income
and mouths to feed the bills have mounted up. 
Thanks to the family spokesperson Aaron and his family now have internet
and a home phone again so in the case of an emergency they can call for
help!  We are asking all of those of you
out there who can understand the frustration and pain that Bullying can cause not only to our children but to us as parents to please help us with our journey to fight the good fight against Bullying and for
Aarons attacker and others responsible to be prosecuted to the fullest of the
law!  Bullying needs to be stopped!  Perhaps Aaron Hill is the catalyst that will
raise more awareness to Bullying and teach children that hurting others is not COOL!</p>

family turn this nightmare into a dream!</p>

<p>Somebody recently has compared Melaku to ""a walking meter of ambient electrical activity, translating the vibes on the street into ecstatic dance moves"". Others say he is something like <i>""a walking earthquake""</i>. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1036939/files/20141121185652-Save_Fendika_02.jpg?1416625012"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""/></p>
<p><i>Melaku in ""his"" taxi </i></p>
<p>Melaku worked his way up from being a street kid to one of the most important cultural operators in Addis Ababa and Ethiopia, and of wide international fame. After a long time sleeping on the streets of Addis, he asked the owners of the FENDIKA if he could sleep there and was given permission. In the coming months he slept behind the bar during the day - at night, he watched performances at the club. ""Stealing with his eyes"" from their movements, he taught himself how to dance. For nine years, he danced at FENDIKA earning only tips, like all the other Azmaris (musicians, singers etc). And it grew in him that this system had to change, that art is weak if it depends on tips only. </p>
<p>Melaku worked hard for many years - and today owns the club. Around him, he has created a family of dancers, musicians and performers who are regularly invited to many places around the world, including some of the biggest festivals like Roskilde or Africolor, the Sauti Za Busara Festival in Zanzibar, Africolor Festival and Jazz à la Villette Festival in Paris, TFF Rudolstadt World Music Festival in Germany. Musicians from all around the world visit FENDIKA, including THE EX from Holland, La Tigre Des Platanes, Le Bruit Du Sign and Ukadanz from France, the Imperial Tiger Orchestra from Switzerland and others.   <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>But the best really is to see the man with your own eyes and begin to feel the joy he emanates. In the next clip from our film you will see how Melaku improvises a dance to the mesmerizing music of pianist Samuel Yirga. Sammy and Melaku are good friends and share a common sentiment for the importance of Ethiopian cultural identity.</p>

<br/><h2><b><h2><b>WHY DOES MELAKU'S WORK MATTER?<br/></b></h2></b></h2>In the mid 1970s, Ethiopian Anthropologist <i>Tesfaye Lemma</i> and his partner, American Peace Corps volunteer <i>Charles Sutton</i> traveled Ethiopia, discovering singers and musicians in the remotest areas of the country and brought them to Addis. <span>Via national television for the first time Lemma familiarized astonished Ethiopians with their very own musical traditions. His “Orchestra Ethiopia” of traditional musicians brought Ethiopian music to wide international success and even toured the USA. </span>Tesfaye Lemma's work was essential for Ethiopians becoming more and more conscious about their own heritage and the richness of their own musical culture. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1036469/files/20141121151644-Save_Fendika_03.jpg?1416611804"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<i>Yohannes Afework, member of ""Orchestra Ethiopia"" and of Melaku's ""Ethiocolor""<br/></i><br/><p>Today, many say that Melaku is the rightful bearer of Lemma's artistic and spiritual heritage. Some members of the ""Orchestra Ethiopia"" who worked with legendary Tesfaye Lemma are still alive, most of them work with Melaku in FENDIKA. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Flutist Yohannes Afework is one of the ancient members of the ""Orchestra Ethiopia"" and  participated in the orchestra's famous tour through the US.

<br/><h2><b>THE AZMARI'S FUNCTION IN ETHIOPIA</b></h2>
<p>Since
 the beginning of time, the Azmari have been Ethiopia's artists: 
singers, musicians or poets. They are story-tellers within the ancient 
tradition of bardic minstrels, similar to the troubadours in European 
culture. Azmaris are free thinkers who since the dawn of time were 
allowed to speak the truth at the king's court even when everybody else 
shut up.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1036473/files/20141121151743-Save_Fendika_06.jpg?1416611863"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>above and below: rehearsal at FENDIKA</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1036859/files/20141121181825-Save_Fendika_05.jpg?1416622705"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div>Azmari culture is hundreds if not thousands of years old. But their social function is still the same in 
contemporary Ethiopia: Azmaris speak about social and political 
issues, about HIV and culture, or simply about the things that happen in
 the world.  Within the protection that music and lyrics provide to 
them, Azmaris can say what nobody else can (or dares to say).<p><br/></p>
<h2><b>WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT FENDIKA?</b></h2>
<p>The
 Azmari's art to wrap the message in music, lyrics, a song or 
masterfully recited poetry requires talent, practice and a lot of 
exercise. But for all that dedication, the only means of wages Azmaris 
can aspire to are tips. The concept of ""real pay"" for artists does not 
exists. </p>
<p>Historically this ""tipping system"" made them depend 
on the whim of their ""masters"" and the favor of local rulers. And it is 
no surprise that most Azmaris are constantly one step away from total 
insecurity. Or, in Melaku Belay's words: ""As an Azmari you have to focus
 on survival, where to get enough food and a place to sleep. Like this, 
art becomes weak"". </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1036510/files/20141121153148-tipping-Zeritu-Getahun.jpg?1416612708"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<i>""Tipping"" legendary singer Zeritu Getahun during her performance</i><p><br/></p>
<p>Azmaris can't show their art where they 
want: in the past it was the ruler's court, today the venues are reduced
 to very few places. FENDIKA is such a place, called <i><b>azmari bet</b></i>
 or ""House of the Azmari"". And, what is almost more important, FENDIKA 
is the first and until today only venue in Addis that provides the 
artists with a fair and secure pay, instead of keeping them dependent on
 being tipped by customers or tourists.</p>
<p>In fact, when Melaku 
took over FENDIKA almost two decades ago, he immediately established 
regular stipends for the Azmari. This was unheard of in Addis and 
Ethiopia, and it meant a revolutionary step forward toward artistic 
independence and freedom. Hence, FENDIKA is economically balanced: the 
income generated by selling tickets and beverages are used to pay the 
artists and the club's maintenance. <br/></p>
<p>As flute player Yohannes Afework says in the previous clip, Melaku is doing a great job in keeping the memory of the older Azmari artists alive: FENDIKA is the only place in Addis where many of them can still find enthusiastic audiences.  The next clip will give you an impressive example: Zeritu Getahun began her career in the 1950s (!) and today, at the age of… (who knows) is a regular guest at FENDIKA. Listen to Melaku introducing her as the voice that an entire generation grew up with, and watch her singing one of her best-known tunes in front of an enchanted crowd.</p>

<br/><h2><b>MELAKU'S GROUP ETHIOCOLOR<br/></b></h2>
<p>In 2009, one year after Melaku took over the FENDIKA, he also founded his own group of musicians and called it ETHIOCOLOR. Playing at FENDIKA every second Friday of the month, Ethiocolor is an innovative Ethiopian traditional band consisting of Kirar (a kind of lyre), Bass Kirar, Washint (flute), Kebero (traditional drums) and Massinqo. </p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F9zO8Q99yhgg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D9zO8Q99yhgg&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F9zO8Q99yhgg%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Ethiocolor live in Copenhagen, October 29th, 2014 (courtesy of the Paal Nilssen-Love curated Actionjazz Festival)</p>“Our goal is not just to assemble traditional musicians and create another folk ensemble. Our vision is to demonstrate that the immense musical heritage of Ethiopia can be performed with a great degree of creativity while still maintaining its identity” says Melaku about Ethiocolor.</div>
<div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Each member of the group has extensive experience in Ethiopia and internationally. Ethiocolor's musicians and dancers have work with traditional music but also with jazz, rock, fusion and hip hop. </span>This<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span>gives<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Ethiocolor's music a </span>special<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> edge.

<h2><b>ALL THIS SUCCESS - SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?!?</b></h2>You're right, this is exactly the question we asked ourselves when we first came to Addis Ababa. And then we started seeing cranes and construction sites everywhere and huge areas where people used to live being prepared for the construction of shopping malls and expensive residential buildings.  Ethiopia is on the brink of becoming a part of the globalized world - but it is not yet. Therefore, some things here are… wild.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1036207/files/20141121133859-Save_Fendika_01.jpg?1416605939"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>Addis Ababa's growing new skyline in 2014</i></p>Addis Ababa today is seeing an unprecedented rush on construction. Investors mostly from the Middle East and Asia are buying land for low prices and start building hotels or shopping malls on it. This is especially true for the KASANCHIS neighborhood. Once a peripheral area for the less wealthy and north to the city center, Kasanchis has become one of the most popular areas in the very heart of Addis Ababa. <p><i></i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1036188/files/20141121133308-Fendika-on-the-Map.jpg?1416605588"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<i>A map of the central areas of Addis; Kasanchis begins about in the map's center - the red dot in the upper right half is where FENDIKA is located. If you want to find FENDIKA on GoogleMaps, put ""Fendika Azmari Bet"" into the search field and you'll find it.<br/><br/></i><p>Kasanchis is the home of FENDIKA CULTURAL CLUB since more than 30 years. And Melaku lives nearby. In the past two-three years, the neighborhood is being swamped with many new buildings, and most of those cement monsters have been risen up without any other criteria than fast profit. Even residential spaces often have their windows at only a few inches from the concrete wall of the building next to it. <br/></p>

<p>Back <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/save-the-fendika-cultural-club-in-addis-ababa/x/8622467"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in September, our first IndieGoGo campaign SAVE FENDIKA</a> was a huge success: with the more than 20.000 Dollars Melaku was able to make a down payment to the owner of the land FENDIKA is built on. The land was not sold to foreign investors - instead Melaku got the option to buy it himself.   <br/></p>
<p>But now Melaku needs to complete the payment and to fulfill his agreement. Once again, Melaku and his ""Azmari family"" of dancers, musicians and cultural operators are calling for help upon their friends all around the world - and this is the final call. <br/></p>
<p>To finish paying the land and keep FENDIKA safe once and for all, until mid December Melaku must find the remaining money and pay off the owner. Friends, cultural investors, private money and most of all <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/save-the-fendika-cultural-club-in-addis-ababa/x/8622467"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the September INDIEGOGO CAMPAIGN</a> helped getting closer to that goal. But even with all that support, of the 75.000 Dollars Melaku needs, less than half of this amount has been collected until today.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1036203/files/20141121133838-Save_Fendika_17.jpg?1416605918"" src="""" style=""""/>c<i>onstructions and a sky full of ""vultures"" - quite symbolic…</i></p>
<i>  </i>Melaku Belay began to launch his own initiative for FENDIKA through Facebook (see here). However, the country's internet is in ""prehistoric"" conditions. Access to the world wide web lags, speeds are way below what we were used to in the West in the mid 1990s. Even in Addis Ababa, the country's capital, except from some foreign institutions and embassies the internet is extremely slow. To open a Facebook page, Ethiopians have to wait for several minutes - to upload the 330 MBs of the videoclip that comes with this initiative would take more than a week if you did it from Addis... </div>
<div>All this is why we want to help Melaku on his quest to safe FENDIKA: we want to enable him and his people - his ""Azmari family"" - to stay where they are and continue their work. Melaku and FENDIKA are already established as a ""cultural hub"" that is vital for Addis Ababa and important for the rebuilding if the Ethiopian cultural identity. </div>
<div>
<p>We want Melaku to continue his work, to maintain FENDIKA and to build a cultural center on top of the old club building that he will finally own. We are convinced that the Azmaris need Fendika (to survive). Addis needs Fendika (to have a conscience). Ethiopia needs Fendika (to maintain the memory of the past and connect it with the present). And ultimately, we believe that Africa needs Fendika (to keep up the cultural diversity in one of the continent's most diverse and multi-ethnic countries - they call Ethiopia ""little Africa"" for a reason). </p>

<h2><b>CAMPAIGN TEAM</b></h2>So who are we and why do we care? All of us have personal and professional  reasons for being attached to FENDIKA and Melaku. <br/><br/><p><i><b>Dirk van den Berg</b></i>  is a director/producer with extensive international experience based in Berlin, Germany. Between December 2013 and June 2014, Dirk and his team were in Addis Ababa for several times, filming the documentary <a href=""http://www.outremerfilm.com/films-addis.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">JAMMING ADDIS</a>. Melaku Belay almost immediately became one of the film's protagonists. More importantly, they became friends. Dirk learned to admire Melaku's passion for Ethiopian culture, his incredible strength and charismatic will-force in his fight for culture. He shares Melaku's belief that culture is one of the most essential building parts for any national identity.  <br/></p>

<h2><b>THE PRESS SAYS ABOUT MELAKU… </b></h2>
<p>Melaku has meticulously collected press articles from all over the world on his home page. Here are the most important articles and press clippings, beginning with a New York Times publication from only a few days ago:  </p>
<h4><b><i>In Ethiopia’s Capital, a Resurgent Jazz Scene (Nov 13, 2014)</i></b></h4>
<blockquote>Ethiopia has been home to 'Azmari Bets' — taverns featuring sung comedy accompanied by a lyre — for centuries, but what the Ethiocolor Band does at Fendika is quite different. Led by the charismatic Addis-born dancer Melaku Belay, the 13-member group has reimagined traditional Ethiopian culture for the 21st century, combining tribal dances and indigenous instruments with jazz, rock, theater and lots of costume changes. On a recent late night, the crowd that gathered around the dancers — wearing spiky wigs made from the hair of gelada baboons — was invited to show off their skills at the 'eskista', a shoulder-shaking jig.<br/>“I believe tradition is never stuck,” Mr. Belay said. The self-taught dancer, who is 38, had first come to the place where the Ethiocolor Band performed when he was a child living on the street. Mr. Belay said that he’d slept under the bar for seven years, earning his board by working without pay. Many years later he bought Fendika Azmari Bet from its former owners and began to shake up the city’s cultural life. As he put it, “I am the bridge to connect jazz and theater to azmaris.”</blockquote>
<h4><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES - Where Feet, Beat and Joy All Soar Funkily (12 August 2011)</i></b></h4>
<blockquote><p>It was a delight to watch and the rhythmic virtuosity of Melaku was often astounding. He can turn either the upper or the lower body into an electrifying vehicle of rapid pulsation. One dance was all to do with his throwing his feet out before him (as if on hot coals). Sometimes the feet alternated, sometimes he hopped, and on one occasion, while hopping brilliantly, he mimed strumming on the other leg, which he kept stretched out like a guitar. <br/></p></blockquote>
<h4><b><i> BBC folk - Ethiopia (26 February 2010)</i></b></h4>
<blockquote>Another inspirational individual we met was a man called Melaku Belay. Melaku was a Sudanese refugee. His family was dispersed, and he ended up as an orphan and street kid in Addis Ababa. To survive he danced for tips at a music club, where he asked if he could sleep on floor. He managed to earn enough tips to eventually buy the club - an amazing feat! He is now a world famous dancer, performing with the Ethiopiques, yet he always comes home to dance in his club and invest in the community. <br/>
</blockquote>
<h4>
<b><i>THE REPORT</i>ER - Clapping, dancing the night away</b> </h4>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Ethiopia’ is a single by the renowned American rock band, the Red Hot Chili Peppers. This single was inspired when one band member visited Ethiopia and on his stay here performed at Fendika, and the energy he felt there inspired the band to do a song entitled ‘Ethiopia’. This energy Red Hot Chili Peppers talks about is the feeling many feel when they come to Fendika located in Kazanchis. The owner of Fendika, Melaku Belay remembers twenty years ago how the Azmari places were famous, where the older generation used to come and the poems they used to give for Azmaris were matured ones. And also ten years ago all the Azmari places were flourishing; now most of the businesses have changed.</p>
<p>Melaku somehow tried to give new meaning to Azmaris, paying the Azmaris, since their livelihoods was totally dependent on rewards from the customers...  <br/></p>

<h4>ADDIS RUMBLE - Impromptu Addis </h4>
<blockquote><p>Melaku Belay is one of the sweetest souls I have ever met. I didn’t know him, but I had watched him dance at his traditional azmari bet‘Fendika’ in Addis (one of the best bars in the world!). He’s also in many video’s dancing with The Ex and with Getatchew Mekuria so I thought it would be great to work with him – to find a way to harness his energy into a very kinetic film – but also to show a bit of his skill at getting the people around him involved.</p></blockquote>

<h2><b>THE IMPACT OF THIS CAMPAIGN</b></h2>
<p>Perhaps the ""big bang"" moment for modern Ethiopian music was in 1924, when a brass-band the Emperor brought from a foreign country became Ethiopia's first official orchestra. Until the 1950s, institutional bands dominated, like the Army, the Police and others. But in the mid 1960s musicians began to fuse Jazz, Soul and Rhythm'n'Blues with the traditional Ethiopian five-note scale and the famous ""modes"" (remember them all? Tezeta, Bati, Anchihoye and of course Ambassel). Ethiopian music reached its first peak in modern times  that became universally known as 'Swinging Addis'. But when the grim Marxist regime of the 'Derg' took power in 1974, it killed 'Swinging Addis' - like it killed almost everything else. Many were murdered, many escaped, most to America. All cultural life was paralyzed. When the horror finished in 1987, only a few musicians found their way back. It took until the second decade of the 21st century that a new generation of Ethiopians began to fill the void. Melaku is one of the protagonists of this generation.  </p>
<p>Ethiopia is an ancient country - and at the same time, it is very young: it was only thirty years ago that the military government collapsed and the country could slowly begin to rebuild itself. And only today, a new generation of Ethiopians begins to feel that once again, their country has a cultural identity. For two decades now, Melaku and his ""Azmari Family"" have been essential for this process of rebuilding and reconstitution. If FENDIKA disappears, they will disappear - or at least they will be without a home and a space where to experiment and to create their art.   </p>
<p>Your contribution will allow Melaku, the Azmaris and the FENDIKA to continue to exist. And with that, to continue contributing to rebuild young Ethiopians' identities. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Together with Melaku we believe that culture is an essential building part for the national identity of a people. With your donation, you help to continue doing this. </span></p>

Ethiopia is an ancient country - and at the same time, it is very young: only a short time ago the military government of the ""Derg"" collapsed and the country could slowly begin to rebuild itself. And only today, a new generation of Ethiopians begins to feel that once again, their country has a cultural identity. For two decades now, Melaku and his ""Azmari Family"" of artists have been essential for this process of rebuilding and reconstitution. Their ""home"" is FENDIKA, the oldest and most important cultural club in Addis Ababa. If FENDIKA disappears, they will disappear.  
Your contribution to our campaign will allow FENDIKA, Melaku and his ""Azmari Family"" to continue to exist and contribute to the rebuilding of Ethiopia's cultural identity. Together with Melaku we strongly believe that culture is an essential building part for the national identity of a people. With your donation, you help to continue doing this. WHAT CHANGED SINCE THE 1st IGG CAMPAIGNBack in September, our first campaign here on IndieGoGo to SAVE FENDIKA was a huge success: with the more than 20.000 Dollars we raised, Melaku Belay, owner of the FENDIKA cultural club was able to make a down payment to the owner of the land the club is built on. The property was not sold to a foreign company - instead Melaku got the option to buy it himself.Now he needs to complete the payment and to fulfill his agreement to purchase FENDIKA. Once again, Melaku and his ""Azmari family"" of dancers, musicians and cultural operators are asking their friends around the world for help. And this is the final call.To finish paying for the land and keep FENDIKA safe once and for all, until Christmas Melaku must find the remaining money and pay off the owner. Friends, cultural investors, private money and  the September INDIEGOGO CAMPAIGN helped getting closer to that goal. But even with all that support, of the 75.000 Dollars Melaku needs, less than half of this amount has been collected until today. If we are all together we will get there and with this campaign manage to bring Fendika under Melaku’s ownership. Finally, Melaku will be able to begin his long-coveted plan for a vibrant new cultural center in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa (see the Dec 11 update for details).

MELAKU BELAY AND FENDIKA 


This campaign's key video is an extract from our recently completed documentary JAMMING ADDIS, of which Melaku is one of the protagonists. If you haven't watched it yet, do it now: in the clip Melaku speaks about FENDIKA, the Azmari (Ethiopian artists similar to traveling minstrels, more about this below) and the cultural life in his country.  And in the final part of the clip he tells his personal story - which as you will see is quite astonishing.
If you followed the September campaign and know all about Melaku, FENDIKA and Ethiocolor, you can scroll down to the section SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? Otherwise, keep reading and watching the other video clips below !
This next clip though is from Melaku's private archives and shows a recent performance at FENDIKA.
(Melaku and his group Ethiocolor at FENDIKA - video courtesy of Melaku Belay)
WHO IS MELAKU BELAY?
Somebody recently has compared Melaku to ""a walking meter of ambient electrical activity, translating the vibes on the street into ecstatic dance moves"". Others say he is something like ""a walking earthquake"". 


Melaku in ""his"" taxi 
Melaku worked his way up from being a street kid to one of the most important cultural operators in Addis Ababa and Ethiopia, and of wide international fame. After a long time sleeping on the streets of Addis, he asked the owners of the FENDIKA if he could sleep there and was given permission. In the coming months he slept behind the bar during the day - at night, he watched performances at the club. ""Stealing with his eyes"" from their movements, he taught himself how to dance. For nine years, he danced at FENDIKA earning only tips, like all the other Azmaris (musicians, singers etc). And it grew in him that this system had to change, that art is weak if it depends on tips only. 
Melaku worked hard for many years - and today owns the club. Around him, he has created a family of dancers, musicians and performers who are regularly invited to many places around the world, including some of the biggest festivals like Roskilde or Africolor, the Sauti Za Busara Festival in Zanzibar, Africolor Festival and Jazz à la Villette Festival in Paris, TFF Rudolstadt World Music Festival in Germany. Musicians from all around the world visit FENDIKA, including THE EX from Holland, La Tigre Des Platanes, Le Bruit Du Sign and Ukadanz from France, the Imperial Tiger Orchestra from Switzerland and others.   

But the best really is to see the man with your own eyes and begin to feel the joy he emanates. In the next clip from our film you will see how Melaku improvises a dance to the mesmerizing music of pianist Samuel Yirga. Sammy and Melaku are good friends and share a common sentiment for the importance of Ethiopian cultural identity.

(link to this clip on our website)
WHY DOES MELAKU'S WORK MATTER?In the mid 1970s, Ethiopian Anthropologist Tesfaye Lemma and his partner, American Peace Corps volunteer Charles Sutton traveled Ethiopia, discovering singers and musicians in the remotest areas of the country and brought them to Addis. Via national television for the first time Lemma familiarized astonished Ethiopians with their very own musical traditions. His “Orchestra Ethiopia” of traditional musicians brought Ethiopian music to wide international success and even toured the USA. Tesfaye Lemma's work was essential for Ethiopians becoming more and more conscious about their own heritage and the richness of their own musical culture. 
Yohannes Afework, member of ""Orchestra Ethiopia"" and of Melaku's ""Ethiocolor""Today, many say that Melaku is the rightful bearer of Lemma's artistic and spiritual heritage. Some members of the ""Orchestra Ethiopia"" who worked with legendary Tesfaye Lemma are still alive, most of them work with Melaku in FENDIKA. Flutist Yohannes Afework is one of the ancient members of the ""Orchestra Ethiopia"" and  participated in the orchestra's famous tour through the US. During a recent lunch meeting at the Ras Hotel, Yohannes surprised all of us, most of all Melaku himself, with what he had to say:

 (link to this clip on our website)
THE AZMARI'S FUNCTION IN ETHIOPIA
Since
 the beginning of time, the Azmari have been Ethiopia's artists: 
singers, musicians or poets. They are story-tellers within the ancient 
tradition of bardic minstrels, similar to the troubadours in European 
culture. Azmaris are free thinkers who since the dawn of time were 
allowed to speak the truth at the king's court even when everybody else 
shut up.


above and below: rehearsal at FENDIKA

Azmari culture is hundreds if not thousands of years old. But their social function is still the same in 
contemporary Ethiopia: Azmaris speak about social and political 
issues, about HIV and culture, or simply about the things that happen in
 the world.  Within the protection that music and lyrics provide to 
them, Azmaris can say what nobody else can (or dares to say).
WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT FENDIKA?
The
 Azmari's art to wrap the message in music, lyrics, a song or 
masterfully recited poetry requires talent, practice and a lot of 
exercise. But for all that dedication, the only means of wages Azmaris 
can aspire to are tips. The concept of ""real pay"" for artists does not 
exists. 
Historically this ""tipping system"" made them depend 
on the whim of their ""masters"" and the favor of local rulers. And it is 
no surprise that most Azmaris are constantly one step away from total 
insecurity. Or, in Melaku Belay's words: ""As an Azmari you have to focus
 on survival, where to get enough food and a place to sleep. Like this, 
art becomes weak"". 


""Tipping"" legendary singer Zeritu Getahun during her performance
Azmaris can't show their art where they 
want: in the past it was the ruler's court, today the venues are reduced
 to very few places. FENDIKA is such a place, called azmari bet
 or ""House of the Azmari"". And, what is almost more important, FENDIKA 
is the first and until today only venue in Addis that provides the 
artists with a fair and secure pay, instead of keeping them dependent on
 being tipped by customers or tourists.
In fact, when Melaku 
took over FENDIKA almost two decades ago, he immediately established 
regular stipends for the Azmari. This was unheard of in Addis and 
Ethiopia, and it meant a revolutionary step forward toward artistic 
independence and freedom. Hence, FENDIKA is economically balanced: the 
income generated by selling tickets and beverages are used to pay the 
artists and the club's maintenance. 
As flute player Yohannes Afework says in the previous clip, Melaku is doing a great job in keeping the memory of the older Azmari artists alive: FENDIKA is the only place in Addis where many of them can still find enthusiastic audiences.  The next clip will give you an impressive example: Zeritu Getahun began her career in the 1950s (!) and today, at the age of… (who knows) is a regular guest at FENDIKA. Listen to Melaku introducing her as the voice that an entire generation grew up with, and watch her singing one of her best-known tunes in front of an enchanted crowd.

MELAKU'S GROUP ETHIOCOLOR
In 2009, one year after Melaku took over the FENDIKA, he also founded his own group of musicians and called it ETHIOCOLOR. Playing at FENDIKA every second Friday of the month, Ethiocolor is an innovative Ethiopian traditional band consisting of Kirar (a kind of lyre), Bass Kirar, Washint (flute), Kebero (traditional drums) and Massinqo. 


Ethiocolor live in Copenhagen, October 29th, 2014 (courtesy of the Paal Nilssen-Love curated Actionjazz Festival)“Our goal is not just to assemble traditional musicians and create another folk ensemble. Our vision is to demonstrate that the immense musical heritage of Ethiopia can be performed with a great degree of creativity while still maintaining its identity” says Melaku about Ethiocolor.

Each member of the group has extensive experience in Ethiopia and internationally. Ethiocolor's musicians and dancers have work with traditional music but also with jazz, rock, fusion and hip hop. This gives Ethiocolor's music a special edge. Indeed, since its inception in 2009, word has spread fast for the young group of musicians, dancers and singers. After winning a wide audience in Addis Ababa and Ethiopia, they began traveling the world. 


And Ethiocolor's members do not only perform inside the FENDIKA, as you can see from the images below taken during this year's Epiphany festivities… 



Melaku and members of Ethiocolor during ""timket"" (Epiphany) 2014 
ALL THIS SUCCESS - SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?!?You're right, this is exactly the question we asked ourselves when we first came to Addis Ababa. And then we started seeing cranes and construction sites everywhere and huge areas where people used to live being prepared for the construction of shopping malls and expensive residential buildings.  Ethiopia is on the brink of becoming a part of the globalized world - but it is not yet. Therefore, some things here are… wild.
Addis Ababa's growing new skyline in 2014Addis Ababa today is seeing an unprecedented rush on construction. Investors mostly from the Middle East and Asia are buying land for low prices and start building hotels or shopping malls on it. This is especially true for the KASANCHIS neighborhood. Once a peripheral area for the less wealthy and north to the city center, Kasanchis has become one of the most popular areas in the very heart of Addis Ababa. 

A map of the central areas of Addis; Kasanchis begins about in the map's center - the red dot in the upper right half is where FENDIKA is located. If you want to find FENDIKA on GoogleMaps, put ""Fendika Azmari Bet"" into the search field and you'll find it.Kasanchis is the home of FENDIKA CULTURAL CLUB since more than 30 years. And Melaku lives nearby. In the past two-three years, the neighborhood is being swamped with many new buildings, and most of those cement monsters have been risen up without any other criteria than fast profit. Even residential spaces often have their windows at only a few inches from the concrete wall of the building next to it. 


Addis Ababa's symbol before a skeleton made of concrete
Back in September, our first IndieGoGo campaign SAVE FENDIKA was a huge success: with the more than 20.000 Dollars Melaku was able to make a down payment to the owner of the land FENDIKA is built on. The land was not sold to foreign investors - instead Melaku got the option to buy it himself.   
But now Melaku needs to complete the payment and to fulfill his agreement. Once again, Melaku and his ""Azmari family"" of dancers, musicians and cultural operators are calling for help upon their friends all around the world - and this is the final call. 
To finish paying the land and keep FENDIKA safe once and for all, until mid December Melaku must find the remaining money and pay off the owner. Friends, cultural investors, private money and most of all the September INDIEGOGO CAMPAIGN helped getting closer to that goal. But even with all that support, of the 75.000 Dollars Melaku needs, less than half of this amount has been collected until today.

constructions and a sky full of ""vultures"" - quite symbolic…
  Melaku Belay began to launch his own initiative for FENDIKA through Facebook (see here). However, the country's internet is in ""prehistoric"" conditions. Access to the world wide web lags, speeds are way below what we were used to in the West in the mid 1990s. Even in Addis Ababa, the country's capital, except from some foreign institutions and embassies the internet is extremely slow. To open a Facebook page, Ethiopians have to wait for several minutes - to upload the 330 MBs of the videoclip that comes with this initiative would take more than a week if you did it from Addis... 
All this is why we want to help Melaku on his quest to safe FENDIKA: we want to enable him and his people - his ""Azmari family"" - to stay where they are and continue their work. Melaku and FENDIKA are already established as a ""cultural hub"" that is vital for Addis Ababa and important for the rebuilding if the Ethiopian cultural identity. 

We want Melaku to continue his work, to maintain FENDIKA and to build a cultural center on top of the old club building that he will finally own. We are convinced that the Azmaris need Fendika (to survive). Addis needs Fendika (to have a conscience). Ethiopia needs Fendika (to maintain the memory of the past and connect it with the present). And ultimately, we believe that Africa needs Fendika (to keep up the cultural diversity in one of the continent's most diverse and multi-ethnic countries - they call Ethiopia ""little Africa"" for a reason).

CAMPAIGN TEAMSo who are we and why do we care? All of us have personal and professional  reasons for being attached to FENDIKA and Melaku. Dirk van den Berg  is a director/producer with extensive international experience based in Berlin, Germany. Between December 2013 and June 2014, Dirk and his team were in Addis Ababa for several times, filming the documentary JAMMING ADDIS. Melaku Belay almost immediately became one of the film's protagonists. More importantly, they became friends. Dirk learned to admire Melaku's passion for Ethiopian culture, his incredible strength and charismatic will-force in his fight for culture. He shares Melaku's belief that culture is one of the most essential building parts for any national identity.  
Lynne Williamson is a folklorist and the director of the Connecticut Cultural Heritage Arts Program. With experience developing cultural heritage projects in the UK and US, she has been assisting FENDIKA and Melaku with touring in the US, communications and fundraising.

THE PRESS SAYS ABOUT MELAKU… 
Melaku has meticulously collected press articles from all over the world on his home page. Here are the most important articles and press clippings, beginning with a New York Times publication from only a few days ago:  
In Ethiopia’s Capital, a Resurgent Jazz Scene (Nov 13, 2014)
Ethiopia has been home to 'Azmari Bets' — taverns featuring sung comedy accompanied by a lyre — for centuries, but what the Ethiocolor Band does at Fendika is quite different. Led by the charismatic Addis-born dancer Melaku Belay, the 13-member group has reimagined traditional Ethiopian culture for the 21st century, combining tribal dances and indigenous instruments with jazz, rock, theater and lots of costume changes. On a recent late night, the crowd that gathered around the dancers — wearing spiky wigs made from the hair of gelada baboons — was invited to show off their skills at the 'eskista', a shoulder-shaking jig.“I believe tradition is never stuck,” Mr. Belay said. The self-taught dancer, who is 38, had first come to the place where the Ethiocolor Band performed when he was a child living on the street. Mr. Belay said that he’d slept under the bar for seven years, earning his board by working without pay. Many years later he bought Fendika Azmari Bet from its former owners and began to shake up the city’s cultural life. As he put it, “I am the bridge to connect jazz and theater to azmaris.”
NEW YORK TIMES - Where Feet, Beat and Joy All Soar Funkily (12 August 2011)
It was a delight to watch and the rhythmic virtuosity of Melaku was often astounding. He can turn either the upper or the lower body into an electrifying vehicle of rapid pulsation. One dance was all to do with his throwing his feet out before him (as if on hot coals). Sometimes the feet alternated, sometimes he hopped, and on one occasion, while hopping brilliantly, he mimed strumming on the other leg, which he kept stretched out like a guitar. 
 BBC folk - Ethiopia (26 February 2010)
Another inspirational individual we met was a man called Melaku Belay. Melaku was a Sudanese refugee. His family was dispersed, and he ended up as an orphan and street kid in Addis Ababa. To survive he danced for tips at a music club, where he asked if he could sleep on floor. He managed to earn enough tips to eventually buy the club - an amazing feat! He is now a world famous dancer, performing with the Ethiopiques, yet he always comes home to dance in his club and invest in the community. 


THE REPORTER - Clapping, dancing the night away 

‘Ethiopia’ is a single by the renowned American rock band, the Red Hot Chili Peppers. This single was inspired when one band member visited Ethiopia and on his stay here performed at Fendika, and the energy he felt there inspired the band to do a song entitled ‘Ethiopia’. This energy Red Hot Chili Peppers talks about is the feeling many feel when they come to Fendika located in Kazanchis. The owner of Fendika, Melaku Belay remembers twenty years ago how the Azmari places were famous, where the older generation used to come and the poems they used to give for Azmaris were matured ones. And also ten years ago all the Azmari places were flourishing; now most of the businesses have changed.
Melaku somehow tried to give new meaning to Azmaris, paying the Azmaris, since their livelihoods was totally dependent on rewards from the customers...  

ADDIS RUMBLE - Impromptu Addis 
Melaku Belay is one of the sweetest souls I have ever met. I didn’t know him, but I had watched him dance at his traditional azmari bet‘Fendika’ in Addis (one of the best bars in the world!). He’s also in many video’s dancing with The Ex and with Getatchew Mekuria so I thought it would be great to work with him – to find a way to harness his energy into a very kinetic film – but also to show a bit of his skill at getting the people around him involved.

PERKS
You donate to support FENDIKA and Melaku's work - so we are not spending money on meaningless swag that will collect dust under your bed. However, we plan to offer authentic Ethiopian clothes and jewelry, and we will create videos and music so you can share FENDIKA's cultural adventure. 
Promising you to send you goods and gadgets is impossible right now: you can't send any objects from Ethiopia to other countries without being subject to ludicrously high taxes. An Ethiopian dress that costs 10 Dollars in a Kasanchis shop would cost 80 Dollars in taxes and shipping costs. We think that wasting your donations in this way would be a contradiction in terms.  But: all donations will be noticed, each contribution will be recognized. And yes, you can also donate privately. We are grateful for your support.  
In the pane to the right we have more details on some perks that we know we can promise. Keep in mind that you can contribute also without claiming a perk, and whatever you think is right to give to this campaign.  
Without further ado, here come the perks: 
$10 – A photo of Ethiocolor taken at Fendika, with signatures of all band members and a dedication on your name
$25 -  CD mixtape put together by Melaku: this is actually what everybody who comes to FENDIKA asks Melaku to do. And he won't do it because the treasure of LPs and Singles he has is part of FENDIKA's allure for the audiences. For this campaign, he will make an exception, so expect these CDs to grow value as collector's items over time. 
$50 – A scarf from Addis, like the ones worn by dancers. Or if you want it more ""natural"", we can try to get you one actually worn by the dancers. 
$75 – Free entrance for life at FENDIKA + the 25$ perk (CD mixtape) 
$100 - Free entrance for life at FENDIKA + the 25$ perk (CD mixtape) + the 50$ perk (a scarf from Addis)  
$200 – a praise song in your honour, created by a real Azmari, recorded and sent to you
$500 – guided tour of Addis given to you by Melaku, including the mythical ""MERKATO"" area
The Addis ""merkato"" (from the Italian word for ""market"") is arguably the largest open-air market area on the entire African continent. The following video shows Melaku's experimental performance at merkato some years back. He literally used the sounds,  rhythms and movements of the market's skilful workers and their materials, transforming them with the use of traditional Ethiopian esktista and guragigna  dance. Melaku called his experiment Ahun, which means ""Now"": on the one hand this underlines the inspirational moment for Melaku's performance, on the other it  captures the continuous transformation of the huge open-air market (note: there is some text in the beginning, the actual video begins at 1'10'').

THE IMPACT OF THIS CAMPAIGN
Perhaps the ""big bang"" moment for modern Ethiopian music was in 1924, when a brass-band the Emperor brought from a foreign country became Ethiopia's first official orchestra. Until the 1950s, institutional bands dominated, like the Army, the Police and others. But in the mid 1960s musicians began to fuse Jazz, Soul and Rhythm'n'Blues with the traditional Ethiopian five-note scale and the famous ""modes"" (remember them all? Tezeta, Bati, Anchihoye and of course Ambassel). Ethiopian music reached its first peak in modern times  that became universally known as 'Swinging Addis'. But when the grim Marxist regime of the 'Derg' took power in 1974, it killed 'Swinging Addis' - like it killed almost everything else. Many were murdered, many escaped, most to America. All cultural life was paralyzed. When the horror finished in 1987, only a few musicians found their way back. It took until the second decade of the 21st century that a new generation of Ethiopians began to fill the void. Melaku is one of the protagonists of this generation.  
Ethiopia is an ancient country - and at the same time, it is very young: it was only thirty years ago that the military government collapsed and the country could slowly begin to rebuild itself. And only today, a new generation of Ethiopians begins to feel that once again, their country has a cultural identity. For two decades now, Melaku and his ""Azmari Family"" have been essential for this process of rebuilding and reconstitution. If FENDIKA disappears, they will disappear - or at least they will be without a home and a space where to experiment and to create their art.   
Your contribution will allow Melaku, the Azmaris and the FENDIKA to continue to exist. And with that, to continue contributing to rebuild young Ethiopians' identities. Together with Melaku we believe that culture is an essential building part for the national identity of a people. With your donation, you help to continue doing this.

<p>****UPDATE AUGUST 2011***</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We are half way through our campaign and very behind our funding goal - please we are urging people to give kindly so we can keep our services available for our community - with the recent riots in London - communities need to come together to look out for eachother and our youth as their future is often not guaranteed. Please keep us alive as we are needed more than ever. <br/></p>

<p>Our Story</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ROTA Entertainment is an independent youth-led media company that aims to change the way young people are viewed in the global media. Founded by a group of charismatic young people across the globe in 2010; ROTA has been able to build global contacts through proper marketing, youth seminars, community events and social media forums.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>THE IMPACT</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The company has been able to produce some small scale community events in London and also successfully produce the UK hit show “Once upon a time in the 90s” which unfortunately must be shelved after only being able to do a two day showcase due to lack of cohesion and co-operation, and unprofessionalism from dishonest, manipulative and exploitative third parties who were involved in the production side of the project and wanted to take advantage of young people through Blackmail. These unfortunate events have led to the company losing a major deal that would have put the company on the map and help us set up bases in the United States and other parts of the world. All community projects have been cancelled and ROTA studios has been closed down until all payments can be made. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The devastating impact affects young people around the world who have put a lot of time and effort into promoting supporting and encouraging the company in hopes of seeing it grow and eventually expand to help them have a voice in their respective country of residence. Unfortunately this financial setback has lead to all project being shelved thus causing the entire team to be redundant and the company to face legal action from funders who believed in our vision enough to make a sacrifice so great as bring our masterpiece to life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We urgently seek to raise the immediate amount of $8000 (More if possible to continue future projects) to prevent our company from being shut down. The youth had a voice in ROTA as their ideas, thoughts, emotions, feelings and situations were presented in an entertaining and educating manner. All donations would be broken as stated.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>$2000 - would go into paying 3 months rent to keep ROTA studios open in order for all rehearsals of future projects to go on. The benefit of having ROTA studios is that it gives the youth a place to meet and discuss. We also allow other young people to come and host meetings in the space where they can discover their own potential. Small community programmes like a sunday soup kitchen and a youth free breakfast club have often been carried out bu ROTA in order to extend our hand to the community.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>$3000- would go towards the development of two of ROTA's future projects ""Blood of a nation"" and ""Once upon a time in the 90s"" - The benefit of productions is that they give the youth temporary employment and help them develop their creative skills in an environment for them by them. These productions help challenge the minds of our youth by providing them with alternative views of what they should be doing in society and not who they are perceived as.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>$3000- Would go towards hiring a new production team of professionals in order to ensure that future projects are a success. We would negotiate contracts which would be handled by a professional solicitor in order for ROTA to be able to avoid any issues in the future. We plan to expand into both film and Television in order to reach a wider audience. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Your contribution allows us to continue to take our community projects as well as media projects to new heights. We will continue to train young people and challenge their thought process by putting on more seminars; not only in the London area but online, so it will be accessible to everyone. </p>

THE IMPACT
 
The company has been able to produce some small scale community events in London and also successfully produce the UK hit show “Once upon a time in the 90s” which unfortunately must be shelved after only being able to do a two day showcase due to lack of cohesion and co-operation, and unprofessionalism from dishonest, manipulative and exploitative third parties who were involved in the production side of the project and wanted to take advantage of young people through Blackmail.

The devastating impact affects young people around the world who have put a lot of time and effort into promoting supporting and encouraging the company in hopes of seeing it grow and eventually expand to help them have a voice in their respective country of residence.

She was just starting to act and go out for auditions. Despite having a Masters in a different field of study she just wanted to try out this ""acting thing"". Amazingly enough 3 of her paychecks ( in a row!) from her 1 hour to 1 day's worth of acting were bigger than my 2 week's worth of work at horrible temp jobs and physically abusive factory/shipping work. Oddly enough she lost interest in acting ( because of her Masters) and found better paying work elsewhere, HOWEVER, I after that third time decided to throw my hat into the ring. My first gig was with a MAJOR cable network and I have never looked back!</p><p>Over the 13 years I have changed. I went from acting to novel and screenwriting.

SAPIEN FILMS over the pass 4 years has filmed many short films in many genres. People seem most intrigued by our horror and suspense work. We even created a horror and suspense series called THE HUMAN GAME which is due to premiere it's 3rd episode sometime next year. We are even planning our first feature length film called BOY: A Story Based On True Events next year (it, too, has an IndieGoGo page). Yet, this is just the tip of the iceberg!

The owner is looking for funds to keep his facility open. This theater is located right off the highway and for all actors, producers, and crew involved this location is extremely convienent. If we help keep his doors open he  has promised to let us use his available space as HQ. In return we will also provide a volunteer staff that will answer phones and keep the place looking a 100% immaculate (and yes I will mop, sweep, and dust if not spit shine (yuk) that place to perfection because I am dedicated)!<br/></p><p><br/></p><h3>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</h3><p>$35,000 is what we really need for now. $25,000 will guarantee that The theater's doors will stay open.

On top of that this facility is the only theater in NJ area that offers all artists (filmmakers, stand-up, muscians) the walk-in opportunity to perform or show their work before the actual show. You literally can call a day or sooner and book space if the schedule permits. It is a wonderful facility which will help SAPIEN FILMS and myself grow in the right direction. No more having meetings in my Mom's music room or backyard. No more sneaking people and having to find already inconvienent parking at my apt. complex!

Dear Friends,
 
My name is Stephanie and I am in the process of launching
Resurgam (which
in Latin stands for ‘I shall Rise Again’), a Portland
Maine based custom sewing, alterations and upholstery business with a focus on
repurposed materials. To me having my own business is about having the ability
to express creativity in a way that is true to my transformative approach to
art and the use of materials.  It is a purpose I am passionate about and have been working toward since my early 20’s. I’m a seamstress
to the core, and can’t see myself doing anything else. With my ambition and
your generous support we can anchor this dream in Portland Maine!!!
I am now close to realizing the goal I have worked towards in the form
of an all-in-one shop for personally repurposed goods. The shop will
include a retail section, a working shop with
customization services focusing on both alterations and upholstery, and a
gallery for local artisan's work.  The business I
envision will channel and magnify my creative energy into something that will
produce exceptional products in a sustainable way while enhancing the quality
of life in my community. 
 
What’s not to love about that!?!?
 
The Impact
 
Resurgam’s services include:
·       
 Repurposing
goods, such as: clothing by way of alterations, re-upholstering vintage
furniture, along with other home goods needs. Our goal is to add a face-to-face
aspect of the business; the services at Resurgam will happen in the shop in
full view of customers. So many products are created overseas and shipped for
great distances before they reach the shelves of local stores. Allowing the
consumer a chance to see works in progress will encourage a feeling of
connection to the products and an appreciation for the ageless trade of sewing.  
·       
The second part of the shop will be retail, for
which will include a unique inventory of custom apparel, reupholstered
furniture and home accessories. All products will lovingly emerge from
repurposed materials. 
·       
Finally the shop will also act as an art
gallery.  Resurgam will be a place where local
creators of sustainable and or recycled jewelry, weavings and art can
consign.  One artist per month can
showcase their pieces, which will be promoted during events, such as the
monthly art walk. 
 
What We Need & What You
Get
 
We
Need:
Here is a list if supplies I need to get started:
 
Prices estimated for studio space and equipment
12 months rent for initial studio space $4,500
Industrial sewing machine $1200
Pattern making table $200
Body form $180
Electric staple gun $120
Total: $6,200
 
With these basic necessities I will be equipped to
launch Resurgam. Your support is an
opportunity to contribute to my vision of a sustainable business with an engaging, artistic
atmosphere that creates a unique
product. I will appreciate any contribution, large or
small.  You Get:As funders, you will receive one of an array of perks as outlined in the 'perk' section above, receive web-updates on the status of this fundraiser and the business later on, the satisfaction of being a part of starting a great business and knowing that you made a dream come true!!
If
you don't want to make a donation but like the project, simply helping
by spreading the word anywhere possible is much appreciated! Also, follow
us on facebook and twitter for sewing tips and links to other excellent
Maine-based small businesses.
 
Thank
you so much!

<p>Funds raised in 2012 will be used to cover camp costs.</p>
<p>The biggest of these is the truck and trailer to haul out all our metal infrastructure - $1200</p>

<p>Our Challenge, even using the cheapist, most terrible beer we can find is $200.</p>
<p>The remaining $400 goes to cover things like rebuilding our infrastructure, year round storage, our WoW event on Saturday, and inevitably, more beer for the Challenge.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Caitlynn and my husbands name is Skyler. We are already legally married as of 19 May, 2010. Meeting him is one of the best things that has ever happened to me. We got married at a park in Jerome, Arizona with only closest of friends. Now we would like to have the whole ceremony with all of our friends and family sharing our joy. Skyler is in film school and I am working towards a Certified Nurse Midwife degree. Being college kids, we can't afford much and don't expect to. We are saving as much as possible. This campaign is to help just that extra little bit with ceremony-related expenses.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is really the first time all of our family will be together and for some family, it will be the first time either of us have seen any of them in a long while. We just want them to enjoy their time as much as possible. The ceremony and reception/reunion will happen regardless of this campaign, it would just be nice to have a bit of wiggle room.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We would like $500 for unexpected expenses and to help with the already-expected ones. As I said before, it will take place either way, it would just be nice to have some cushion. Unfortunately, the only perk I can think of is a video from the ceremony uploaded to youtube thanking individuals for their donations (Unless you want a bottle of bubbles)</p>

""Our mission is to fight HIV/AIDS by building a movement of young leaders dedicated to global health equity and social justice.""

 

Hey everyone!  We are FACE AIDS at New York University.  FACE AIDS is a vibrant, supportive, and diverse peer community for youth, through which they can move from being dedicated but disconnected individuals to being an impactful coalition of leaders who learn from and support one another.  As members of this growing non-profit organization, we are dedicated to the eradication of inequalities plaguing those directly affected by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, both domestically and internationally. Founded in 2005 by three Stanford students, FACE AIDS is still a relatively young organization, but we are proud to say that we are at over 210 high schools, colleges, and universities and growing by the minute.  

""We are ambitious and optimistic, and focus on opportunities for change and impact.""

Since its creation, FACE AIDS has had a strong relationship with Partners in Health, a non-profit organization committed to providing the ""highest quality of care to the 2.4 million"" impoverished people it now serves worldwide.  FACE AIDS works mainly with PIH and its many Rwandan sites helping to bring quality healthcare and resources to those often overlooked and underfunded by the world.  This year, PIH has asked FACE AIDS to sponsor the rehabilitation and revitalization of Nyamirama Health Center in Eastern Rwanda.  To meet the challenge, FACE AIDS has pledged to raise 185,000 USD.  FACE AIDS at NYU, has pledged to raise 4,000 USD.  While we know it is quite an ambitious goal, we know that we can raise it, with your help of course!

Nyamirama Health Center
""It is about fulfilling a community's hope""

Located directly off of the main highway that runs straight from Rwanda’s capital city to the border of Tanzania, Nyamirama Health Center is connected to a reliable supply of electricity, and is easily accessible to the roadside community of over 25,000 that it serves. Despite these advantages and the fact that it serves the largest catchment area in the district, Nyamirama has faced incredible challenges and has been extremely underfunded in the past. The center’s facilities consist of two small buildings, neither of which is well-suited to medical care. In one of the buildings, a laboratory doubles as a vaccination room during busy childhood immunization campaigns. Due largely to the overwhelming need of the local community, the Ministry of Health has placed Nyamirama as its top priority to receive additional support in Kayonza District.

The Impact
""Our work is driven by our commitment to a larger vision of a world without HIV/AIDS, a world in which all people have equal access to high-quality, comprehensive health care, and by our belief that our generation can and must be the one to make this vision a reality.""

 
Your support of Nyamirama Health Center is critical to helping us prove the success of the Rwandan model and to use it to push the limits of global health delivery. With the partnership of the local community and the health center’s enthusiastic and capable director, PIH plans to ramp up its support of Nyamirama Health Center.

<p>As a Youth Minister I would dress up in a rented Gorilla suit and surprise kids at restaurants and at school on their birthday.  It was a hit; kids and parents loved it.  I would like to do this again, but perhaps expand to places like children's hospitals.  They do make clothes which I would like to purchase if any funds remain.  A clothed Gorilla might not be as scary.</p>
<p>I am raising funds to purchase the costume, becasue it makes more financial sense to purchase it, instead of throwing money away by renting- plus I would be purchasing one that is very high quality so it will last, and people will appreciate the difference.</p>

African citizens of the world and enthused students of other cultures, have the ability to become introduced to traditional Yoruba concepts and ideas, have the means to form an alliance between Yorubas on the African continent and Yorubas in the Diaspora, and have the opportunity to be introduced to timeless Yoruba philosophy and concepts.

<p> </p></div>","Executive Summary
 
Omo Oduduwa Radio (also known as OORadio), based in Marietta, Georgia, provides quality radio programming centered around educating the global community about the traditional aspects of the Yoruba religion, culture, and customs, respectively. In addition, OORadio serves as a platform to discuss topics that affect and plague the African community, such as conflict resolution, the incorporation of traditional African values, adopting a holistic approach to health and wellness, and Yoruba language, and Yoruba culinary studies, to name a few. OORadio is a forum designed to unite and empower Yoruba practitioners worldwide.
 
Hosted by founder Osaremi Lanloke, OORadios weekly shows provide a colloquium where audience listeners can engage in discourse with experts over a variety of subjects. In addition, OORadio offers scholarly formal instruction on the Yoruba religion, culture, and customs, through teleconferences and online classes.

Business Description and Vision
OORadio's vision is to bring traditional Yoruba culture to the 21st Century. OORadio's business purpose is to create a forum, whether through formal classes, online courses, and radio shows, that discuss topics that celebrate, educate, empower and unite Yoruba practitioners throughout the globe. African citizens of the world and enthused students of other cultures, have the ability to become introduced to traditional Yoruba concepts and ideas, have the means to form an alliance between Yorubas on the African continent and Yorubas in the Diaspora, and have the opportunity to be introduced to timeless Yoruba philosophy and concepts. The Yoruba culture has spread all throughout the world, with more than 30 million practitioners worldwide through different religious off-shoots including Candomblé, Lucumí, Shango, Anago, Oyotunji, some aspects of Umbanda, Winti, Obeah, and Vodun. These religious off-shoots not only provide an opportunity for an interchange of information, but also contain a virtually untapped market that is ripe with potential. OORadio acknowledges that we are in the midst of a cultural, spiritual, and religious revolution.
Scholars all over are searching for an opportunity to learn about other forms of religious expression, to study a robust, ancient culture, and to become educated about the African ways of commerce, politics, and the family unit. People want to know how to maintain meaningful traditions while living in a fast-paced, modern society. People are interested in fulfilling their destiny and purpose, from an African perspective.
 
Presently, OORadio is looking to expand its market share by providing an avenue in which to address all of the aforementioned topics, and then some. This is accomplished by connecting cultural custodians, key politicians, dignitaries, priests, celebrities, and the like, with novices who want to gain access to the Yoruba world. OORadio plans on expanding into different media such as online video streaming and television shows. In addition, OORadio will be support trans-Atlantic business liaisons.
 
Radio programs are hosted under the umbrella of OORadio:
 
Ifa Code of Conduct hosted by Ifategunse Osadele (Sundays 8-9 pm EST)
 
Omo Oduduwa Radio, hosted by Osaremi Lanloke (Tuesday 8-10 pm EST)
 
Engage the Spirit, hosted by Iya Osunkemi Ajewunmi (Thursday 8-9 pm EST)
  
Definition of the Market
 
Presently, there are a variety of online radio shows that provide information on distinct topics such as Yoruba religion (Ifa), holistic medicine, and African cultural restoration. However, few have actually integrated all of the aforementioned concepts. This business is unique in that it integrates both the spiritual and cultural aspects of the traditional Yoruba belief system (Ifa) into one integral component. In addition, Ms. Lanloke's connections are unparalleled; Ms. Lanloke is connected to a bevy of Yoruba priests, thus creating a virtual nexus of Yoruba practitioners, from the shores of Benin to villages in Brazil.
 
It is estimated that there are over 30 million practitioners worldwide. OORadio's present target market entails internet-savvy Yoruba practitioners and novices who are seeking to increase their knowledge-base about Yoruba spirituality and culture. Statistics have shown that the majority of listeners reside in the United States. OORadio will expand beyond this core audience to gain listeners in other countries besides the United States that have a heavy concentration of Yoruba practitioners. In addition, OORadio will be hosting upcoming shows that will feature scholarly experts and priests that originate in locations other than the United States and Nigeria.
 
OORadio has designs on capitalizing on all facets of social utilty (Twitter /Facebook /blogtalkradio) to gain media exposure. Moreover, OORadio is looking to gain exposure through international e-zines (online magazines) and magazines that focus on religion, spirituality, and culture. OORadio is committed to reciprocal support with other businesses and committed to community events for more exposure.
 
Organization and Management
 
OORadio is a sole-proprietorship business, operated, maintained, and hosted by Priestess Osaremi Lanloke. Priestess Osaremi Ogunleye Lanloke, founder and Host of Omo Oduduwa Radio, was born in Oyotunji African Village in Sheldon, South Carolina to Chief Alagba Ogunleye and Priestess Ayoka Abiomi Lanloke. Her family taught her everything that they could about the customs and traditions of her ancestors. Osaremi is a priestess of Obatala, teacher, speaker, founder, producer and radio host of Omo Oduduwa Radio.

<h3>Aside from the ideas of sustainable energy and off the grid living, I need to live CHEAPLY!<br/><br/>I want to be able to live as cheaply as possible, for a while.<br/><br/><br/>It is getting colder! <br/><br/>Off The Grid and Mobile!</h3>
<p>I am trying to view being homless not as a ""curse"" or ""affliction"" but more of an opportunity and motivation to put a few of my ideas about sustainable living to practice, and to the test.</p>
<ul>
<li>My name is Bob Cutler. I am a sound engineer by trade. I have worked in the murky and shadowy world of underground music for decades. This means I have never had a 401K, or much of a savings account, or retirement fund. </li>
<li>My life has taken yet another un-planned for but not entirely unpredictable turn, and I find myself homeless. My basic abstract bottom line here is to raise money to buy myself a cheap, sustainable home.</li>
<li>Beyond just putting a thin aluminum barrior between myself and true homelessness, I want to explore and develop methods and technologies for surviving ""Off The Grid"": Free from financial and technocratic bondage to utility companies and their impact on the environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a long, sad and frustrating story of what has lead me to this point in my life. I'll bore you with it if you really want to know. But I feel kind of creepy telling my own tale of woe knowing that there are a lot of people with far more painful and pathetic lives out there. The long and the short of it is that until very recently I had been taking care of my elderly dying father. His care in his home became more then I could manage. He is now in a care facility and I am homeless. And being that for the entire time I was caring for him I was unable to work a ""real"" job, and therefor have saved up no resources of my own.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What is my plan?</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<p>The $25,000 goal I posted here is only a guess. Like anything, the sky is the limit. The main goal is to buy a working motorhome / RV that I can live in. (As well as some sort of rental space to store my stuff that I no longer have a home for)</p>
<p>What do you get out of the deal?<br/>Well, what do you want?<br/><br/>One of my projects will be to have this entire motorhome wired to run on solar and wind energy. As part of that  will be conducting experiments in solar and photovoltaic technology. In short: I'll be creating little ""toys"" based on some of Tesla's theories. I will reward these to larger donors.</p>
<p>If all else fails, I'll just go rent an apartment in a human ant hill.</p>
</div>

<div class=""post"">Things change. Usually at a pace and schedule that we arn't quite ready for or happy with.
<div> </div>
<div>I'll spare you as much of the long stupid soap opra story as I can and cut to the bottom line:<br/><br/>I need to buy a working motorhome. This is the cheapest and simplest solution I can imagine for my situation for the time being.</div>
<div> </div>

<div> </div>
<div>I'm homeless.</div>
<div>And I suddenly have a bunch of legal bills and expenses that I didn't have just a couple of weeks ago.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I had been a ""home care giver"" for my elderly father, living in his home and taking care of him as best I (we) could as he suffers from Parkinsons and Alzhimers, Diabetes and just being old, tired and cantankerous. (And thats the part we love about him!)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Cutting out a sad, angry, miserable and embarassing (And very confusing!) story of a chain of events, suffice it to say that Dad's care needs had become something that I (we) could no longer manage in his home.<br/>(And my personal safety and mental and emotional well being have ALSO become ""at risk"" in that environment, to put it politely)<br/><br/>So, Dad is now in a Hospice Care House where he can get the health care and support that he needs, that we were no longer able to give him at home.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In the mean time, as Dad's finances and status of his house gets sorted out. (His house may have to get sold off to cover the costs of his end of life care.....We're not holding our breath for Romney or the Tea party to help out and chip in a few bucks.) I am ""between homes"".<br/><br/>My plan for now is to buy an RV. A large motorhome type vehical that I can live in. (Or alternately, a camper trailer. But having something self-propelled is MUCH better)<br/>I don't plan on actually driving the thing a whole lot, unless necisary, but I want to be able to move quickly and easily from one place to another.<br/>Remember: You arn't homeless if you are CAMPING! (Or on tour)</div>
<div> </div>

<div>For now this is the simplest, and cheapest lifestyle I can imagine for myself for the next year or so (Or forever!?)</div>

I am trying to view being homless not as a ""curse"" or ""affliction"" but more of an opportunity and motivation to put a few of my ideas about sustainable living to practice, and to the test.

My name is Bob Cutler. I am a sound engineer by trade. I have worked in the murky and shadowy world of underground music for decades. This means I have never had a 401K, or much of a savings account, or retirement fund. 
My life has taken yet another un-planned for but not entirely unpredictable turn, and I find myself homeless. My basic abstract bottom line here is to raise money to buy myself a cheap, sustainable home.
Beyond just putting a thin aluminum barrior between myself and true homelessness, I want to explore and develop methods and technologies for surviving ""Off The Grid"": Free from financial and technocratic bondage to utility companies and their impact on the environment.

I have a long, sad and frustrating story of what has lead me to this point in my life. I'll bore you with it if you really want to know. But I feel kind of creepy telling my own tale of woe knowing that there are a lot of people with far more painful and pathetic lives out there. The long and the short of it is that until very recently I had been taking care of my elderly dying father. His care in his home became more then I could manage. He is now in a care facility and I am homeless. And being that for the entire time I was caring for him I was unable to work a ""real"" job, and therefor have saved up no resources of my own.


What is my plan?
Break it down for folks in more detail:
The $25,000 goal I posted here is only a guess. Like anything, the sky is the limit. The main goal is to buy a working motorhome / RV that I can live in. (As well as some sort of rental space to store my stuff that I no longer have a home for)
What do you get out of the deal?Well, what do you want?One of my projects will be to have this entire motorhome wired to run on solar and wind energy. As part of that  will be conducting experiments in solar and photovoltaic technology. In short: I'll be creating little ""toys"" based on some of Tesla's theories. I will reward these to larger donors.
If all else fails, I'll just go rent an apartment in a human ant hill.


The Impact
When the going gets weird.....the weird go mobile!

Things change. Usually at a pace and schedule that we arn't quite ready for or happy with.
 
I'll spare you as much of the long stupid soap opra story as I can and cut to the bottom line:I need to buy a working motorhome. This is the cheapest and simplest solution I can imagine for my situation for the time being.
 

 
I'm homeless.
And I suddenly have a bunch of legal bills and expenses that I didn't have just a couple of weeks ago.
 
I had been a ""home care giver"" for my elderly father, living in his home and taking care of him as best I (we) could as he suffers from Parkinsons and Alzhimers, Diabetes and just being old, tired and cantankerous. (And thats the part we love about him!)
 
Cutting out a sad, angry, miserable and embarassing (And very confusing!) story of a chain of events, suffice it to say that Dad's care needs had become something that I (we) could no longer manage in his home.(And my personal safety and mental and emotional well being have ALSO become ""at risk"" in that environment, to put it politely)So, Dad is now in a Hospice Care House where he can get the health care and support that he needs, that we were no longer able to give him at home.
 
In the mean time, as Dad's finances and status of his house gets sorted out. (His house may have to get sold off to cover the costs of his end of life care.....We're not holding our breath for Romney or the Tea party to help out and chip in a few bucks.) I am ""between homes"".My plan for now is to buy an RV. A large motorhome type vehical that I can live in. (Or alternately, a camper trailer. But having something self-propelled is MUCH better)I don't plan on actually driving the thing a whole lot, unless necisary, but I want to be able to move quickly and easily from one place to another.Remember: You arn't homeless if you are CAMPING! (Or on tour)
 

 
For now this is the simplest, and cheapest lifestyle I can imagine for myself for the next year or so (Or forever!?)",5.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h1>Why Oakland?</h1>
<p>Our program will be located in the Fruitvale neighborhood of Oakland, California.  Fruitvale hosts Oakland’s largest Latino population, comprising 49.5% of Fruitvale’s total population. Oakland struggles with many issues including rapid unemployment, widespread poverty, and an elevated rate of violent crime.  Oakland’s poverty rate is 17.2%. (City-Data.com, 2009) </p>
<div style=""margin: 0px; background-color: transparent; border-collapse: separate;"">
<br/>Summer of Solutions Oakland will bring together a group of passionate youth and community members to improve the economic conditions and human well-being of residents of Fruitvale, as well as develop replicable models for community sustainability. <br/><br/><h1>Theory of Change</h1>
In Summer of Solutions Oakland 2011 we will engage four tracks: Food Justice, Clean Energy, Thriving Communities, and Transformational Media &amp; Story.  <br/><br/>Solutionaries will use their creativity, talents, and skills to create self-sustaining and replicable projects related to the tracks.  Summer of Solutions provides participants with training, mentorship, and support to make their projects successful. We partner with local organizations to learn from and support the work that is already happening.<br/><br/>We begin with a strong commitment to equality and justice. We recognize that many communities have been ""spoken for"" instead of ""listened to"". In order to truly create global transformation we must begin by addressing root causes of the problems. We do this by engaging in community visioning, and integrating anti-oppression principals and practices in our trainings, projects, and program planning and development. <br/><br/><div style=""margin: 0px; background-color: transparent; border-collapse: separate;"">

<p></p><p></p></div>","Hi.
My name is Kylee
Lane and
I am the CEO and creative force behind LuxuryLaneSoap.com.
I have been fortunate enough to build and grow my company from very
small beginnings, almost ten years ago with no initial funding and I
have reached a bridge I can not cross without your help.It is time for me to expand. I have the space and I have the muscle to build the studio of my dreams, but I simply do not have the money. My available area is raw and in need of some serious restoration. With your help, I will be able to purchase the materials I need to build the future of my company.What
We Need & What You GetThe
area we are using is a ballroom on top of a 1917 Georgian revival
style home in Sheldon, IA. In the 1940's, the entire 1,000
square foot area was converted into an apartment. In 2013, my family
and I began tearing down walls to completely renovate this
space and give it new life as The Lane Laboratory. This will be a
place to passionately create with the tools needed to continue
producing products you love.Even
if we don't reach our goal, every dollar raised helps buy materials!

So
here is what we need and where the money will go:

-Floor
repair. 1134 square feet of flooring

-Full
electrical. Lights including wiring, outlets and junction boxes

-Tear
down apartment walls and repair outside walls. Plaster, taping mud
and paint

-Window
replacements and frame repair

-Lumber
for building tables, shelving and work stations

-New
pipes/plumbing. Ugh. Plumbing...

-Equipment
rental and waste removal services

-Restocking
raw materials and production costsWe will be doing all of the labor ourselves to keep costs down and the more we can raise, the more we can do! If you have a service you would like to donate, please let us know!We anticipate documenting all of this! So you can look forward to online tutorials and/or blog posts of our being awesome. (We actually love doing this stuff. See some of our work here and here.)Mega Bonus! If you guys rock my world, anything over $5,000 goes into:- Product line expansion!- Computer hardware and/or software update!- A screen printer. No more flaking labels!- Hiring and training a customer service team with on-site help!But we will talk more about those goals later...The ImpactEvery.
Single. Dollar. Helps. Even
from a single dollar collected, every last donation will go towards
the tools I need. I will complete this studio and you have the power
to ensure it happens before I am 200 years old.As
a contributor, not only are you helping breathe life back into a
nearly 100-year old piece of history, you are helping me prove that
this can be done. I have been talking about this expansion for years
and it is time to make it happen. As a small business, I do not have
to sell out for growth and profit and I CAN continue setting my own

Pollinate Energy is an Australian social business working with 470 slum

<p>Spending time in these urban slum communities I have realized
that the level of menstrual hygiene is really low among the women. I have come
across situations where women use ash, mud, plastic, leaves and dirty rag
pieces of cloth during their menstrual phases, while I was intrigued and
conducted a survey with 250 in the lower income groups, including women from
urban slums, girls from government schools and women from factories ,which
bought forth an important issue which can help towards the solution of this
crisis. Hitherto it was believed that, just a lack of affordability was the
major factor in non-usage of sanitary napkins in lower middle class urban
society &amp; rural areas of India. But the study indicates that lack of
awareness and knowledge are also major contributors to non-usage. </p>
<p>There are only a few organisations working towards this issue,

for women and girls in these urban slum communities and lower middle income
society.</p>
<p>So here I am with Sahana P Bhat venturing into Sukhibhava ,a social enterprise based in Bangalore, India. Sukhibhava aims to tackle
contributing factors to gender inequality through provision of products and
education that enable and empower women. Menstrual hygiene management is one of
those factors and it is unfairly felt by the under privileged and urban poor.
Sukhibhava will hold education sessions and sell menstrual hygiene products to
urban poor women who previously did not have access due to economic or
awareness factors.  A micro distribution business model has been developed
where local entrepreneurial women will distribute and sell products. </p>
<p>Sukhibhava
operates on the premise of full life cycle products. From awareness to
disposal,this refers to both to concern for the environmental impact of the
product as well as aiming to take the journey towards the adoption of new
products and services with the customers it deals with. Products that
Sukhibhava is interested in are often not easy products to take up. Being there
for the customer means ensuring the smoothest uptake. Continued support is
important for Sukhibhava to ensure it is making the most impact in the most

<p><b>Greetings
<span>Prospective Donor:</span></b></p>
<p>My name is Tracy Arnold. I am a community developer and the founder
of <b><i><a href=""http://www.arnoldplace.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Arnold Place</a></i></b>, a 501c.3, non-profit organization based in Prince Georges
County, Maryland (suburbs of Washington, D.C).  Currently, we are in the process of acquiring
a 16,400 square foot facility to serve as a transitional shelter for 24 young
women (ages 14-22) who may<b> be </b>homeless; pregnant and/or
diagnosed with HIV/AIDs.  In addition to
the residential facility, <b><i><a href=""http://www.arnoldplace.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Arnold Place</a></i></b> hopes to purchase an
adjacent 8,000 square foot building to provide supportive services to the
residents such as: Occupational Skills Training;  Computer Skills; Financial Literacy and other
supportive services to young women in transition.  <b><i><a href=""http://www.arnoldplace.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Arnold Place</a> </i></b><i>will be a “place of Serenity, Comfort, Transformation and Hope”</i>. We
need your financial support to help make this much needed facility a reality
for homeless young women and pregnant teens in the D.C., Maryland metropolitan area.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Meet
Arnold Place’s Founder—Ms. Tracy Arnold:</b></p>
<p>Born in Washington, DC, I spent most of my youth in the
nearby Maryland suburb of Prince Georges County. As a result, I am very
familiar with many of the issues and concerns of young people in the
community.  Upon completing my high
school education, I worked in the federal government in a number of capacities.
However, I <b>have always </b>had a passion for helping those in need. So, in
1998, I made a decision to go into the mortgage profession as a Mortgage
Originator.  In only two years, it was
evident that I had found my niche. I became the top producer for an office of
more than 20 loan officers; while managing 10 other loan originators at the
same time. I served in that position for 4 years, learning as much as I could
about the mortgage business. Then in 2005, I opened my own, independent  mortgage brokerage company-- Mortgage
Consultants for Life, Inc.  (MCL).</p>
<p>Since its inception, MCL has helped hundreds of families
purchase their first home; or refinance their home totaling approximately
$100,000,000 in loan amounts with the numbers increasing monthly.  However, during the recession, the mortgage
business took a downward spiral, which basically cost me everything—my
business, my home, my hopes and dreams.  It has not been easy, but I was able to start over. Meanwhile,
I have also been given an assignment to “Help Others”, especially young girls
and women who are experiencing homelessness; teen pregnancy; or diagnosed with
HIV/AIDs.  </p>
<p>Having had some turbulent teenage years as a runaway, I know
firsthand how being homeless can lead young women down the wrong path in life,
if they do not have the guidance and support needed.  I also know that just because you may make
some bad choices, it does not mean that you cannot turn your life around and do
something positive.   <b><i><a href=""http://www.arnoldplace.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Arnold Place</a></i></b>, will be a place of
serenity that young women can come to live for a defined period of time; find hope
and be given a chance to transform their lives.</p>
<p>My personal motto is: “<i>No One Can Do Everything, but Everybody Can
Do Something.”  </i>I have taken my pain and turned it
into a passion to help young women by building <b><i><a href=""http://www.arnoldplace.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Arnold Place</a></i></b>.  I truly hope that my story will move you to
donate to this very worthwhile initiative.</p>
<p><b>Why
Give to Arnold Place:</b></p>
<p>By donating to <b><i>Arnold Place</i></b>, you will help build <i>“a place of Serenity, Hope and
Transformation</i>” for young, homeless, women (ages 14-22) in the metropolitan
.D.C. area.  Your donation will not only
provide young women a place to live while their lives are in transition, but
you will also provide them an opportunity to receive counseling, education,
life skills and other beneficial training. 
Using a customized six month curriculum, each resident will receive the
personal development, guidance and assistance needed to help transition their
lives from homelessness to independence.</p>
<p><b>How
You Can Help:</b></p>

fundraising efforts such as: our Shoe Donation and Clothing Donation projects.</p>
<p>Additionally,
we have a goal to collect at least 1 million pairs of shoes <i>(worn or new</i>); and 1 million pounds of clothing<i> (men, women and children). </i>All shoes and clothing <span>will be recycled and a
monetary donation made back to Arnold Place, a 501c.3, charitable organization.</span></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Last summer, the Snohomish Boys &amp; Girls Club had a couple of very remarkable and impactful experiences. First, a local Girl Scout troop built 2 beautiful raised vegetable gardens for our kids to plant and maintain. Luckily, they are in excellant condition and can be used for many years. Another cool experience was taking the kids to a blueberry farm and watching their excitment in picking the berries and even more so in taking them home and sharing with their families. It was neat to hear about what they planned to make with them. It is really hard to believe that most kids do not know where their food comes from and how many have not experienced gardening and farming.</p>
<p>The idea for this project stemmed from a great event last year. The Snohomish Farmers Market held a one day ""Kids Day at the Market"". During that day, local kids could set up tables at the Farmers Market and sell items that they had made. We signed up for a table and got busy creating! We decided to use recycled bottles to make ""stained glass"" vases and candle holders. They turned out beautiful and were a hit with shoppers. However, that was not the best part. The best part was watching the crafters sell the vases and how happy it made them to talk to people about how they had made them. After that day, the kids set the table up at the Boys &amp; Girls Club and kept selling items for many days.</p>
<p>Through this project, we will set up a weekly ""City Kids County Marketplace"" once a week on the large lawn in front of our Club. We plan to bringin local artists to teach the kids marketable skills such as soap making, candle dipping, baking, jewelry making, and other forms of art. Through the market, they will also learn business skills such as marketing, promotions, setting up displays, money, and much more.</p>
<p>With the money raised in this campaign, we will purchase supplies, bring in teachers, promote the market, and purchase items such as tables and tents. We will also use the funds to maintain our garden and purchase seeds.</p>
</div>
<div>As a Boys &amp; Girls Club project, this fits perfectly into our ""Formula For Impact"" and our priority outcomes of Healthy Lifestyles, Good Character and Citizenship, and Academic Success. Through this High Yield Learning Activity, all outcome areas are achieved.</div></div>","Short Summary

<p>About the Fuzzy Bee: </p>
<p>Hello! My name is Marisa Woods and I am the proud owner of The Fuzzy Bee, a handmade card and illustration company. </p>
<p>I started The Fuzzy Bee in 2011 as a way to pursue and keep up with my degree in Studio Art. I have always been an artist. Through The Fuzzy Bee, I have been able to pursue my lifelong dream of making and producing my work. </p>
<p>In the past two years I have sold my work, gained sales experience, created and worked with my online etsy shop, and taken an online class in handmade business. I am finally ready to make The Fuzzy Bee a reality and take this business to the next level. I am starting this fundraising campaign for key supplies and capital to launch The Fuzzy Bee and fall line in 2013. </p>
<p>This is where you, my super fans, come in! </p>

<p> </p>
<p>What I Need and Some Real Fuzzy Perks: </p>
<p>I have spent a while figuring out what I need to make this business efficient on it's own, right from the start. I need some key materials and initial capital to make this possible!</p>
<p>1) The Mac- Although my current mac is awesome and we are best friends, The Fuzzy Bee is in desperate need of an art specific computer. The Mac is the brains of the whole operation, as I draw most of my images on a drawing tablet on photoshop. The total cost of the Mac is $1,500. </p>
<p>2) The Printer- I have been printing my items with some help from friends and family and am ready to take on the job myself! A way to print my work is important as The Fuzzy Bee is first launching. Cost? $1000</p>
<p>3) The Camera- I use a small point and shoot right now but if I have learned anything from etsy and online sales, it is that photos of your work are everything! The camera cost- $900</p>
<p>4) Materials and Paper- The rest of the funds are going towards my spring line, shipping costs, and capital for marketing. What does that mean? That includes; paper, ink, envelopes, more paper, shipping envelopes, stamps, packaging design, and yes, MORE PAPER! $1,700</p>
<p>All donations to The Fuzzy Bee come with perks! If you go to the right hand side bar you can select what donation level you would like!</p>
<p>Make sure to watch the video above as it will also explain more about my company and some fuzzy perks. You can head over to the ""Gallery"" and take a look at some of my current cards for the spring!  </p>

<p>SUN, FUN, OUTDOORS, FAMILY PICNICS, FRIENDS GETS-TOGETHERS … surely there is a whole lot of things you would prefer spending your time on during warm enjoyable summer… Why would you bother spending it on shops, when you can just jump online and shop for all family and all occasions in just 1 hour?</p>
<p>Winter... Why there is no proper summer clothes in the shops when we are just about to take a break from winter and head to warm countries?? Have you had those situations before? Well, we have… And we are about to change it! </p>
<p>Our idea is to create an online summer shop offering only summer goods 365 days a year. Crazy? That may be.. but given that there is always summer somewhere in the world it’s not… The shop with a global presence will allow purchasing summer goods regardless of the season and customer’s location.</p>
<p>The e-shop is planned to be a ""one stop"" shop selling summer clothes, shoes, cosmetics, bijouterie, travel and home accessories for all family all year round.</p>

<p>The idea is a combination of the things we love and passionate about: summer, holidays, fashion and design. In fashion we love quality fabrics, great patterns, amazing colour combinations and use of art.</p>
<p>The initial launch of the shop is planned to take place in Russia with Russian language website on ‘.ru’ ecommerce platform. The headquarters as well as the warehouse will be located in Russia. Why Russia? Because it is our home market, which we understand better. It is also rapidly growing online fashion retail market with demanding customers constantly looking for the bright unique outfits and prepared to pay extra for the quality.</p>
<p>Although the initial launch is planned to be in Russia, the store will have global presence with English version, ‘.com’ domain name and logistics enabling shipping globally. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://media-cache-ec4.pinimg.com/originals/2d/2e/14/2d2e145bf9b961ff878cd0ae48e1a42f.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p><strong>Positive concept.</strong> It is all about things the majority of people like: sun, fun, joy, holiday.</p>
<p><strong>Niche market.</strong> The niche for the shop will be unchanged season, not price. We are planning to target different customers offering summer goods within three main categories: basic, mid market and luxury. We are planning to raise awareness of the shop among our customers by positioning ourselves as the best place to go for summer fashion and other summer goods. This is particularly important in the colder seasons, when people tend to go for holidays to warm climate countries and keen to refresh their wardrobes.</p>
<p><strong>Range of summer goods.</strong> It will not be limited to women’s and men’s fashion. We will be selling kids clothes and toys, sunscreen care, hair and skin summer care, travel and home accessories. The “one stop” shop concept will help customers to spend less time for searching required products before their holidays.</p>
<p><strong>Global presence.</strong> Although the home and key market will be Russia we will sell globally. The global presence will be enabled through the English version of the website on ‘.com’ ecommerce platform and logistics enabling shipping globally.</p>

<p><strong>Range of brands and designers.</strong> While travelling we are constantly discovering new brands and designers who offer some really great outfits. We are keen to introduce them into our shop. We will also source some basic things like t-shirts, shirts, thongs, etc. from Chinese and Indonesian producers to satisfy different customer’s preferences. The range of brands and number of stock items directly depend on the available financing.</p>
<p><strong>The price and quality of the goods.</strong> We just admire quality and good-looking things! We believe that classy look can be created with inexpensive items - it is just a matter of the right choice of items and accents. This is exactly what we are trying to achieve in the store: to offer clothes across three main price categories (cheap, middle range and expensive) with the main condition - it should look great and be of a great quality.</p>
<p><strong>Support young/unknown artists and designers.</strong> We are keen to have unique products in the shop. We do appreciate art and design. We are eager to give opportunity to young and/or unknown artists and designers to create outfits, cool prints or patterns for clothes and to make accessories.</p>

<p> <strong>Elena</strong> - the initiator, the entrepreneur-to-be, the girl for whom corporate career is just not enough.</p>
<p>I have successful corporate career - during last 9 years I was working for a global consultancy firm growing internally from an entry level to managerial positions. My specialisation is financial due diligence (financial analysis in simple words) of the companies due for sale or purchase. My experience covers quite broad range of industries, geographies and corporate cultures. I do have experience in retail industry too. During my career I performed analysis of financial and operational performance of Russian and Australian retail companies. The recent projects were in Australia: due diligence of the leading retailer of sport goods in Australia and the iconic Australian surfing company. I do understand the retail business drivers and major challenges.</p>
<p>I always felt that I want to work for myself.. think now I have enough experience and courage to try. I am very keen to start my own journey in the world called ‘business’.</p>
<p> <strong>Elena</strong> (different one:)) - fashionista, the girl with impeccable taste and experience in marketing and exhibitions organisation. Elena has solid experience in organising and managing exhibitions of different kind. Elena is very good at acquiring useful contacts and building relationships. She is also very good in styling her looks … funny how sometimes people think she wears luxury brands when she just mixed up some mass market brand items.. By the way Elena is the girl on the main image photo of this campaign:)</p>
<p>Me and Elena have the whole range of cloths - from cheap t-shirts to high fashion brands and have experience in creating great looks for any budget. Even though we are aware of the fashion’s latest trends, we believe that fashionable look doesn’t necessarily need to belong to any particular designer. The most important is to find right colour combination, right shape and to feel confident in what you wear. Well… and maybe to add a couple of accents to make the look standout. We can help people with any budget to look great. Think this is the most important skill that we are going to bring to the shop. </p>
<p>To get an idea of our taste and type of things we will most likely be sourcing to the shop, please have a look at out <a href=""http://pinterest.com/shopsummer/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pinterest</a> boards.</p>
<p><strong>Nicole</strong> – mentor and advisor. Nicole is very energetic and inspiring entrepreneur. She is co-founder of Drink Digital and Balmain Boat Company and a founder of VIAJIYU (shoes made to order). She has more than 15 years experience in digital media and her company, Drink Digital, was a digital strategy advisor for such companies as J&amp;J, Ebay and Nestle in Australia.</p>

<p>We need a quite significant <strong>initial investment to buy stock and to finance our marketing plan</strong>.</p>
<p>We are planning to start with about 1000 items across all categories. The range and designer vs regular brands mix are dependent on the financing available. The requested target amount of the campaign reflects our estimation of approximately 500 to 1000 items stock level across all categories. As we are trying to make a quality product and create a positive image, we cannot compromise on the quality of goods in the shop and quality of logistics. It means we might be required to buy more expensive stock from reputable suppliers and invest more in reliable logistic chains.</p>
<p>We have created a number of <strong>perks</strong> to stimulate investing in our project. Contributions of $25 -$1,000 will be rewarded with the discount of 3% to 20% for any purchase in the shop. Contributions of $500 and $1,000 will also be rewarded by gift vouchers of $300 and $600 nominal value (yes, you will get discounts first and then will be able to buy it with the voucher).</p>
<p>As stated in our smaller perks – contributions less than 25$ are also very much appreciated. We are big believers in “giving” concept and that small things help to build the bigger ones.</p>

<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> </span></p></div>","SUN, FUN, OUTDOORS, FAMILY PICNICS, FRIENDS GETS-TOGETHERS … surely there is a whole lot of things you would prefer spending your time on during warm enjoyable summer… Why would you bother spending it on shops, when you can just jump online and shop for all family and all occasions in just 1 hour?
Winter... Why there is no proper summer clothes in the shops when we are just about to take a break from winter and head to warm countries?? Have you had those situations before? Well, we have… And we are about to change it! 
Our idea is to create an online summer shop offering only summer goods 365 days a year. Crazy? That may be.. but given that there is always summer somewhere in the world it’s not… The shop with a global presence will allow purchasing summer goods regardless of the season and customer’s location.
The e-shop is planned to be a ""one stop"" shop selling summer clothes, shoes, cosmetics, bijouterie, travel and home accessories for all family all year round.
   
The idea is a combination of the things we love and passionate about: summer, holidays, fashion and design. In fashion we love quality fabrics, great patterns, amazing colour combinations and use of art.
The initial launch of the shop is planned to take place in Russia with Russian language website on ‘.ru’ ecommerce platform. The headquarters as well as the warehouse will be located in Russia. Why Russia? Because it is our home market, which we understand better. It is also rapidly growing online fashion retail market with demanding customers constantly looking for the bright unique outfits and prepared to pay extra for the quality.
Although the initial launch is planned to be in Russia, the store will have global presence with English version, ‘.com’ domain name and logistics enabling shipping globally. 
 
Positive concept. It is all about things the majority of people like: sun, fun, joy, holiday.
Niche market. The niche for the shop will be unchanged season, not price. We are planning to target different customers offering summer goods within three main categories: basic, mid market and luxury. We are planning to raise awareness of the shop among our customers by positioning ourselves as the best place to go for summer fashion and other summer goods. This is particularly important in the colder seasons, when people tend to go for holidays to warm climate countries and keen to refresh their wardrobes.
Range of summer goods. It will not be limited to women’s and men’s fashion. We will be selling kids clothes and toys, sunscreen care, hair and skin summer care, travel and home accessories. The “one stop” shop concept will help customers to spend less time for searching required products before their holidays.
Global presence. Although the home and key market will be Russia we will sell globally. The global presence will be enabled through the English version of the website on ‘.com’ ecommerce platform and logistics enabling shipping globally.

Range of brands and designers. While travelling we are constantly discovering new brands and designers who offer some really great outfits. We are keen to introduce them into our shop. We will also source some basic things like t-shirts, shirts, thongs, etc. from Chinese and Indonesian producers to satisfy different customer’s preferences. The range of brands and number of stock items directly depend on the available financing.
The price and quality of the goods. We just admire quality and good-looking things! We believe that classy look can be created with inexpensive items - it is just a matter of the right choice of items and accents. This is exactly what we are trying to achieve in the store: to offer clothes across three main price categories (cheap, middle range and expensive) with the main condition - it should look great and be of a great quality.
Support young/unknown artists and designers. We are keen to have unique products in the shop. We do appreciate art and design. We are eager to give opportunity to young and/or unknown artists and designers to create outfits, cool prints or patterns for clothes and to make accessories.

 Elena - the initiator, the entrepreneur-to-be, the girl for whom corporate career is just not enough.
I have successful corporate career - during last 9 years I was working for a global consultancy firm growing internally from an entry level to managerial positions. My specialisation is financial due diligence (financial analysis in simple words) of the companies due for sale or purchase. My experience covers quite broad range of industries, geographies and corporate cultures. I do have experience in retail industry too. During my career I performed analysis of financial and operational performance of Russian and Australian retail companies. The recent projects were in Australia: due diligence of the leading retailer of sport goods in Australia and the iconic Australian surfing company. I do understand the retail business drivers and major challenges.
I always felt that I want to work for myself.. think now I have enough experience and courage to try. I am very keen to start my own journey in the world called ‘business’.
 Elena (different one:)) - fashionista, the girl with impeccable taste and experience in marketing and exhibitions organisation. Elena has solid experience in organising and managing exhibitions of different kind. Elena is very good at acquiring useful contacts and building relationships. She is also very good in styling her looks … funny how sometimes people think she wears luxury brands when she just mixed up some mass market brand items.. By the way Elena is the girl on the main image photo of this campaign:)
Me and Elena have the whole range of cloths - from cheap t-shirts to high fashion brands and have experience in creating great looks for any budget. Even though we are aware of the fashion’s latest trends, we believe that fashionable look doesn’t necessarily need to belong to any particular designer. The most important is to find right colour combination, right shape and to feel confident in what you wear. Well… and maybe to add a couple of accents to make the look standout. We can help people with any budget to look great. Think this is the most important skill that we are going to bring to the shop. 
To get an idea of our taste and type of things we will most likely be sourcing to the shop, please have a look at out Pinterest boards.
Nicole – mentor and advisor. Nicole is very energetic and inspiring entrepreneur. She is co-founder of Drink Digital and Balmain Boat Company and a founder of VIAJIYU (shoes made to order). She has more than 15 years experience in digital media and her company, Drink Digital, was a digital strategy advisor for such companies as J&J, Ebay and Nestle in Australia.
 
We need a quite significant initial investment to buy stock and to finance our marketing plan.
We are planning to start with about 1000 items across all categories. The range and designer vs regular brands mix are dependent on the financing available. The requested target amount of the campaign reflects our estimation of approximately 500 to 1000 items stock level across all categories. As we are trying to make a quality product and create a positive image, we cannot compromise on the quality of goods in the shop and quality of logistics. It means we might be required to buy more expensive stock from reputable suppliers and invest more in reliable logistic chains.
We have created a number of perks to stimulate investing in our project. Contributions of $25 -$1,000 will be rewarded with the discount of 3% to 20% for any purchase in the shop. Contributions of $500 and $1,000 will also be rewarded by gift vouchers of $300 and $600 nominal value (yes, you will get discounts first and then will be able to buy it with the voucher).
As stated in our smaller perks – contributions less than 25$ are also very much appreciated. We are big believers in “giving” concept and that small things help to build the bigger ones.

<h2 class=""MsoNormal""><strong>How it all started:</strong></h2>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This summer, my family and I packed our bags and traveled across the world to Uttarkashi, Uttarakhand, India. We were actually one of the 40 other people from around the globe, attending a 2 week retreat held by Kriya Yoga Institute, in their ashram in the Himalayas. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> From the minute we arrived, there was a constant downfall of rain. Two days into our trip, the Ganga's water level rose drastically; the river was becoming more and more powerful. The situation became so severe, that the bridge we crossed to get to the ashram was wiped away! We were stuck.  Finally, nine days later some villagers helped our group (40 outsiders) cross a deadly trail to reach a location where we were rescued by an Indian army helicopter.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><strong><em>If it weren't for these villagers we wouldn't have been able to get out.</em></strong> I'm forever grateful for them. They put their own lives at risk to help us, whom they've never met, and they weren't even asking anything in return. I'm also grateful for the Indian army. They sent helicopters to rescue us and many other villagers.</p>

<h2 class=""MsoNormal""><strong> The devastation of the flooding:</strong></h2>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">What my group went through was close to nothing compared to the villagers scattered throughout the Himalayas.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>It is reported that thousands<em> are dead</em>, and over <em>5,000 people are missing</em> (BBC News). Many have lost their homes and loved ones. </strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This was the worst flash flood in 80 years. The river took everything in its path. Houses, land, and people were all washed away by the power of the Ganga.</p>
<h2 class=""MsoNormal""><strong>What the Villagers need:</strong></h2>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">They need as much as they can get! Imagine <strong>LOSING EVERYTHING, </strong>well that's their reality. Paramahamsa Prajnanananda once said, ""…<em>adopt the attitude that everyone in this world belongs to one family...""</em> So, let's help our family!!</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">With your help and contributions, we will revive these villagers’ lives by building new homes and providing food and supplies.  Here are the estimated costs:</p>
<ul style=""margin-top: 0in;"" type=""disc"">
<li class=""MsoNormal"" style=""""><strong>$8,500 to build one house</strong></li>
<li class=""MsoNormal"" style=""""><strong>$20 to feed one person for 10 days</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The goal is to build about 10 houses and provide food for the villagers. That's why I set my goal of raising $108,000. I hope that each one of you will make this your personal goal as well and help me as much as you can. </p>

<h3>The SOS Story</h3>
<p>S.O.S. (Support Our Soldiers) was founded in 2007 after our son-in-law<br/>was deployed to Iraq.   We learned that the soldiers serving were in<br/>need of many basic necessities, so we felt we had to do something. <br/>The first year, we held a very successful motorcycle run and raised money<br/>for care packages and sent over many, many items to our soldiers.   <br/><br/>We then learned that there were so many others doing exactly the same thing, so<br/>we asked our son-in-law what is it that you guys (and gals) need (or want) the most?   Hetold us that the MWR (Morale, Welfare and Recreation) needed funds more than anyone.   What is that you ask?  Well, we asked the same thing,<br/>which is why they needed help…no one seemed to know what they are.  <br/>The soldiers do though.  The MWR is a network of support and leisure<br/>services designed for use by U.S. soldiers (active, Reserve, and Guard), their<br/>families, civilian employees, military retirees and other eligible<br/>participants. The MWR is the only organization within the military that supplies<br/>them with the day-to-day “distractions” of the mundane, and sometimes<br/>terrifying life they live.   They supply everything right down to the<br/>Frisbees and footballs that they use to blow off steam.  So, in year two,<br/>we held another motorcycle run and all our fundraising efforts were directed to<br/>the MWR.</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>So...what is it we need and what is this campaign all about? </p>
<p>I’m asking if you’d help us defray some of the costs to get all the necessary paperwork in with the IRS to complete our non-profit status and other start-up necessities.   I’m really not sure what part of ‘non-profit’ these folks don’t get, but these start-up costs are daunting.  I would SO much rather be spending our funds on helping our Veterans!!!  Any and all help is VERY much appreciated!!!  To those of you who already have…THANK YOU!!!!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact is not for us.  It's for our Veterans!  Each and every penny we raise goes directly to helping our Veterans, whether they are active duty, retired, Reserve, or their families.   Our Mission Statement is simple:   To assist Veterans of the United States Armed Forces in any way possible, and to raise awareness of the POW/MIA issue. </p>
<p>That's it!   Help us help our Veterans, because freedom has NEVER been free!</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You can join us in our Mission!!!!   Please contact our President, Greg, at:  <a href=""mailto:sosincpresident@aol.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">sosincpresident@aol.com</a> for details!   We meet regularly the first Monday of each month.   Please join us!</p>
</div></div>","The SOS Story
S.O.S. (Support Our Soldiers) was founded in 2007 after our son-in-lawwas deployed to Iraq.   We learned that the soldiers serving were inneed of many basic necessities, so we felt we had to do something. The first year, we held a very successful motorcycle run and raised moneyfor care packages and sent over many, many items to our soldiers.   We then learned that there were so many others doing exactly the same thing, sowe asked our son-in-law what is it that you guys (and gals) need (or want) the most?   Hetold us that the MWR (Morale, Welfare and Recreation) needed funds more than anyone.   What is that you ask?  Well, we asked the same thing,which is why they needed help…no one seemed to know what they are.  The soldiers do though.  The MWR is a network of support and leisureservices designed for use by U.S. soldiers (active, Reserve, and Guard), theirfamilies, civilian employees, military retirees and other eligibleparticipants. The MWR is the only organization within the military that suppliesthem with the day-to-day “distractions” of the mundane, and sometimesterrifying life they live.   They supply everything right down to theFrisbees and footballs that they use to blow off steam.  So, in year two,we held another motorcycle run and all our fundraising efforts were directed tothe MWR.
We are completely a volunteer organization, and depend on our members to help us in the Mission.  
Since most of us ride, we are also a Riding Club, but having and/or riding a motorcycle is NOT a requirement to join us!   These activities are secondary to our Mission, but we enjoy the camaraderie and Brother/Sisterhood all the same.
Our membership is open to all!  Men, women, Veteran, non-Veteran, biker, non-biker, even children in our Junior Division.   The only “requirement” of membership is the belief in our Mission and the desire to make a change.
We are located in Massachusetts, so we will be helping Veterans in this state, and all states in New England.   We are also committed to raising awareness for the POW/MIA issue.

<p>We need your help to raise the $20,000 needed to develop this tool into a simple Web based platform that everyone can use. As we raise funds beyond that level, we will continue to add additional features and enhancements to provide even more detailed information to help you increase traffic in your marketing.</p>
<p>Check out the list of perks. There are several levels for that you can jump into, and each level comes with great perks!</p>
<p>Don't forget to help us by spreading the word! The more people that find out about this tool, the more powerful we can create it for you! Plus, Special Surprise Perks for the Top Individuals who help spread the word, use the Indiegogo Share Tools, so we know who you are.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>I have used this tool to find so many HIGH TRAFFIC words that it is hard to believe! One client wanted us to set-up a Google Adwords campaign for them. We had Google build out the campaign and suggest the keywords, and then we added in some keyword phrases that we found with this software.  One of the secret keyword phrases, generated by our software, was responsible for over half of the search traffic!  For my own company, ONE SECRET Keyword phrase generated almost $100,000 in sales last month alone!</span></p>
<br/><p>Now you might be thinking, how is this different from all of the other keyword research tools out there?  Good question!  This is different in two ways:</p>
<br/><p>First, this software is based on actual search suggestions from Google.  Most tools either make you think up your own keywords or try to copy them from your competitors. What makes you think that your competitors have the premium keywords?  They started out just guessing on what people might search!</p>
<br/><p>Second, this software is designed for real people. Most keyword tools require technical knowledge, and if you don't already know what you are doing they don't help much.  We want to provide a simple, easy way for you to increase your online traffic, without knowing all those SEO secrets you keep hearing about.  And, if you do know some secrets, then this will work even better!</p>
<br/><p>We have the software to generate thousands of keyword phrases from a single keyword based on Google's own algorithm.  We want to make this valuable software available to every small business owner trying to generate online traffic.  In order to develop the web-based software for subscription use, we need to raise $20,000 to develop this in a way that it will work for you each and every time.</p>
<br/><p>Once launched, level one will provide single use memberships for $50 or monthly memberships for $79 per month.  If we exceed our goal, we will continue development to add additional features like:</p>

<h4><b></b></h4><p><b style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 24px;"">Who Are We? And What Are We Up To?</b><br/></p>
<p>We’re Shawn and
Aaron Grose, two “alternatively thinking” brothers who’ve been passionately
brewing for over 10 years.  We love
beer, bikes, and sustainable technology. We’ve been involved in the Michigan
craft beer movement since 1995 and would love to pour
our passion into making a difference by bringing our unique brewery to the city
of Detroit.  </p>
<p>Windmill Pointe Brewing is our
collective vision that intertwines bikes, people, energy and beer into a
“one-of-a-kind” sustainable brewery. The Brewery retrieves its main source of
energy from our patent-pending system that utilizes bicycles supported by wind
and solar technologies.  With our
“Pedal-Powered Beer™” energy monitoring program and sustainable philosophy, we
will create a positive impact in our community by producing a more environmentally
friendly beer.</p>
<p>We see Pedal-Powered Beer™ as a community-driven
effort to create unique beer styles while building a relationship between our
patrons and the brewery. When fulfilled, this dream will make us the country’s
very first pedal-powered brewery. </p><h4><b>What Makes Us Different?</b></h4><p><a rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>
</b></a></p>
<p>We generate
our own electricity via “Pedal-Power” – the cornerstone of our electric brew
house. Our stationary bikes produce pedal-power which is collected, stored, and
recorded. The number of kilowatts we produce from in-house “Pedal-Power” is
subtracted from the total number of kilowatts used in each brew session. The
goal is to produce more energy through pedal-power and sustainable technologies
than consumed by the production of our beer.  </p>
<p>Our
community members are invited to power our beer in the form of a challenging
stationary bike race - The Tour de Beer!:</p>
<p></p><ul>

<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Patrons pedal our bikes</span><br/>
</li>

</li>
</ul><h4><b>Making A Difference Differently
</b></h4>
<p>Beside the
health benefits of riding bikes in our brewery, we’ll collaborate with
organizations that also make a difference in Metro Detroit. We’ve entered into
a relationship with the world-renowned Pewabic Pottery to brew a beer that
supports their educational foundation. And we’re continually thinking about, seeking and nurturing other ways
we can give support.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><b>Why Are We Asking For Funding?</b></h4>
<p>Here’s the reality for us ~ we need
funding to bring Windmill Pointe Brewing Company to the next level. And we know
exactly what we need to do.  It’s
that simple.  Here’s how your

were raised will complete the development of the Pedal-Powered Beer™ program.   </p>
<h4><b>Our “Triple Bottom Line” Goal </b></h4>
<p>We’ll be
measuring our success on a “Triple Bottom Line” approach.  Three principles will guide us in
making Windmill Pointe Brewing Company a truly sustainable business:</p><p></p><ul>
