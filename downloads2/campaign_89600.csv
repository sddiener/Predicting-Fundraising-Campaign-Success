The CEO, Hallam Park, majored in design and for the last 15 years he has been a designer and a creator. The motto of his work has been to provide a happier, healthier, and more convenient life for people who are exhausted from living busy lives. Park has put his passion and creativity into numerous product designs, turning 10 of them into patents. During his work, he experienced the inconvenience of having to use a smartphone for virtually everything in our society and started working on a design that could compensate for the mental stress and inconvenience smartphone causes.  After 2 years of tremendous effort and research, world’s first smart jacket was released for both iPhone and android users.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469037744/tlgqaoikjmldp0lm1dyz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469097856/lgub8zsnmva0y6byrsdu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>SMARTPHONE LOSS PREVENTION</strong></p><p>When you are more than 33 feet away from your smartphone, alarm goes off on BADGE and your phone through an app called HALLAM P NEW YORK to prevent losing your phone.

It's your time to shine with this hot item while you enjoy traveling, camping, partying, playing games, listening to music, taking photos and all kinds of sports activities such as jogging and biking. 

It comes in handy wherever you are, whenever you go out, who you are with　 

   We are a startup company founded in Manhattan, New York in September, 2014. We have specialized teams for jacket design, jewelry design, Bluetooth & NFC research, wearable technology, smartphone accessories and production that work collaboratively to design and produce creative and smart technology products of HALLAM P NEW YORK. The CEO, Hallam Park, majored in design and for the last 15 years he has been a designer and a creator. The motto of his work has been to provide a happier, healthier, and more convenient life for people who are exhausted from living busy lives. Park has put his passion and creativity into numerous product designs, turning 10 of them into patents. During his work, he experienced the inconvenience of having to use a smartphone for virtually everything in our society and started working on a design that could compensate for the mental stress and inconvenience smartphone causes.  After 2 years of tremendous effort and research, world’s first smart jacket was released for both iPhone and android users.   SMARTPHONE LOSS PREVENTIONWhen you are more than 33 feet away from your smartphone, alarm goes off on BADGE and your phone through an app called HALLAM P NEW YORK to prevent losing your phone. BADGE contains the latest Bluetooth 4.0 pcb board and it works precisely as it is paired up with your smartphone.   KID , PET PROXIMITY ALERTAfter you take out KEY CHAIN from the jewelry pocket, you can hang it on a < child’s clothes or bag / dog collar >. When the < child / pet > is more than 33 feet away from you, alarm goes off on BADGE and your phone through the app HALLAM P NEW YORK to warn you.   ANTI-THEFT VALUABLES When you take out KEY CHAIN from the jewelry pocket, you can hang it on the valuables such as Mac Book, luggage or pets. When they are more than 33 feet away from you, alarm goes off on BADGE and your phone through the app HALLAM P NEW YORK to warn you.  GPS TRACKINGIf you lose your smartphone, child, pet, or valuables, you can activate the location-tracking on HALLAM P NEW YORK App to locate them.  FINDING A SMARTPHONECan't find your phone ? press your badge button to ring your Phone even if it's on Silent! We make finding your phone too easy.   PHONE CALL, TEXTS, SOCIAL MEDIA PUSH NOTIFICATIONSIf you are not able to hold your phone in your hand, BADGE lets you know when you receive calls, messages or social media notifications, through the HALLAM P NEW YORK App.  MAGNETIC AUTO CONNECT CHARGING WHILE IN USE When you run out of phone battery, bring a built-in magnetic cable in the sleeve close to the charger port on the phone. Then, it would get matched automatically, making it very convenient to charge even in the dark.　 MAGNETIC AUTO CONNECT CHARGER POCKETThe right chest inner pocket holds an auto-coupling magnetic cable. It automatically connects to and charges the phone very conveniently.  SAFETY LEDWhen you are outside in the dark, jogging or riding a bicycle, LED lights will keep you safe. There are three lighting modes: constant light, slow blinking and fast blinking. If you use the same lighting mode with your friends or family, it’s easy to spot them even in pitch dark.   LED FLICKER While jogging or riding, It reduces the risk of traffic accidents when turning.  MUSIC CONTROL (PLAY, STOP, SKIP)When you listen to music with your smartphone in the pocket or bag, you can play, stop and skip a song with just one click. When you click the button on JACKET Badge once, it plays, another click stops it, and two consecutive clicks change the song.  SMART TV, MacBook, iPad CONTROL (PLAY, STOP, SKIP)BADGE can play, stop and control smart TVs, MacBooks and iPads. It is convenient to use it to remotely control the devices during a presentation or else.   SELFIE When using a selfie stick or a tripod, clicking the button on JACKET Badge will take a photo for you, as long as you’re within 33 feet.   AUTO-CONNECT FAVORITES When you tag the smartphone to the right sleeve (NFC functions built in), it automatically connects you to bookmarks, such as google or Facebook.   AUTO-SOS CALLWhen you tag the smartphone to the left sleeve (NFC functions built in) in the case of danger of emergency, it dials 911 automatically.  AUTO-MUTE POCKET When you put the smartphone in the left pocket (NFC functions built in), it automatically shifts to “Mute mode”, which turns off sound or blocks WIFI and Bluetooth. It is especially useful when you have to turn off those functions urgently at a meeting or a movie theater.  AUTO-MUSIC PLAYING POCKET When you put a smartphone in the right side of the pocket (NFC functions built in), music plays from the phone automatically.   ULTRA-THIN BATTERY    It is equipped with 2 battery pockets for phone charging. They can each hold ultra slim batteries of 3000mah, and handle up to 6000mah.  BATTERY WARM-UP MODE When you press the warming button on JACKET BATTERY, the embedded safety heating panel generates a heat between 110 and 130℉ in the battery pocket on your back and neck, making you warm.  ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES SHIELDING FABRICSThere is absolutely no need to worry about the health impacts of electromagnetic waves. All wires embedded in the battery pockets and the rest of the jacket are coated with electromagnetic waves shielding fabrics. Moreover, the battery pockets are finished with net fabrics to increase the thermal efficiency.   NECK PILLOW, SLEEP SHADE   When you want to rest during the travel on a plane or a car, a neck pillow and a SLEEP SHADE that are built in the hood will guarantee a comfortable sleep. BUILT-IN GLOVESWhen you feel cold, you can just put on the built-in gloves in the sleeves.  VENTILATION ZIPPERWhen you feel hot, just open the ventilation zippers to cool down your body.  SUNGLASS RACK POCKET You can store your sunglasses safely in the chest pocket.  PASSPORT, CARD POCKETYou can also store your passport and cards safely in the pocket 　 DETACHABLE HOODBecause the hood with a built-in neck pillow is detachable, it can be stored separately, if necessary.  JEWELRY POCKETThe jewelry pocket is in the left side of the hood and you can store BADGE, Key chain or ring in it.   EARPHONE POCKETYou can store earphone in the left inner pocket in the hood. You can take it out and use it, if needed.   BLUETOOTH EARPHONEBluetooth earphone is built in the earphone pocket of the jacket. The wireless earphone means no more wires that tangle with your arms and fall out. 　  WASHABLEBefore washing Jacket, please separate BADGE, charging battery and LED module. Once that’s done, it’s perfectly okay to machine-wash it as the rest of the electric devices are waterproof. CUSTOMIZABLE NFC functions of JACKET can be customized easily, no matter when users want. Many functions are included, especially  AUTO MUSIC PLAY ,  AUTO-MUTE, AUTO-SHARE CONTACT, and AUTO-CONNECT FAVORITES. AUTO-SHARE CONTACTSimply by tagging KEY CHAIN to your friends’ or colleagues’ smartphones that have NFC functions, you can share your contact information.   AUTO-DIAL TO THE OWNER If you lose your KEY CHAIN, the person who picks it up can call you simply by tagging it on his or her smartphone with NFC functions.

<p>Getting your BASE insoles is easy. 2D images are taken through the Wiivv smartphone app to capture the unique contours of your feet. These images are verified by an expert and processed in Wiivv’s blazing-fast customization engine to produce a 3D-printable file for a pair of insoles to perfectly fit you and you only. This unique file is then sent to enterprise-grade 3D printers that use SLS technology (a system of powerful and precise lasers) to build a durable and flexible shell. Finally, skilled workers use their crafting knowledge to deftly apply a beautifully designed top layer along with features to further improve comfort, like silicon treads and cushions.</p>

<p>In a kinematic analysis done by a 3rd party, BASE custom insoles have been found to significantly reduce joint loading in the knee and hip – which translates into reduced injuries and increased performance in athletic activities. They give you more control through your full range of motion and help spread the impact force of walking and running activities to areas best suited for absorption.</p>

<p>Our specially designed heel cup delivers optimum stability, shock absorption and comfort. The “hole in the heel cup” design was created in collaboration with pedorthic experts to reduce heel raise. Reduced heel raise is a key feature that allows users of BASE insoles to keep the built-in or removable insoles of their current footwear. The ¾ shell delivers biomechanical neutrality, lessens pressure on the forefoot, and offers better stability. <i><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/base-by-wiivv-custom-3d-printed-insoles/payments/new?perk_id=3395459"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Purchase your pair here</a></i></p>

<p>Led by Wiivv's own biomechanics team, BASE’s development was done in partnership with experts in the fields of sports medicine and orthopedics in the effort to create the ultimate custom insole. The team identified and improved on critical design features that affect insole comfort and effectiveness, such as the medial/lateral arch shape and offset, insole contour and thickness, shock absorbing heel pad, cushioning top layer, insole length and shape to maximize flexibility in 1st MPJ joint, and heel cup shape and depth.</p>

<p>BASE fills the wide gap in the product offerings available between a corrective orthotic and an off-the-shelf insole. Corrective orthotics are usually custom, but are costly. Off-the-shelf insoles have lower price points, but they do not fit your unique contours. <i><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/base-by-wiivv-custom-3d-printed-insoles/payments/new?perk_id=3395459"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Purchase your pair here</a></i></p>

</div>","Purchase your pair hereBASE by Wiivv is a body-perfect insole that is engineered to maximize comfort, promote alignment and lessen fatigue. Your pair of BASE insoles will closely follow your unique foot curves to give you the support and stability that you need to keep going. To customize your pair of insoles and get measured, all you need is 5 minutes and a smartphone. With this kind of convenience, you’ll never want to go for off-the-shelf again. Purchase your pair here


  

Getting your BASE insoles is easy. 2D images are taken through the Wiivv smartphone app to capture the unique contours of your feet. These images are verified by an expert and processed in Wiivv’s blazing-fast customization engine to produce a 3D-printable file for a pair of insoles to perfectly fit you and you only. This unique file is then sent to enterprise-grade 3D printers that use SLS technology (a system of powerful and precise lasers) to build a durable and flexible shell. Finally, skilled workers use their crafting knowledge to deftly apply a beautifully designed top layer along with features to further improve comfort, like silicon treads and cushions.

  

In a kinematic analysis done by a 3rd party, BASE custom insoles have been found to significantly reduce joint loading in the knee and hip – which translates into reduced injuries and increased performance in athletic activities. They give you more control through your full range of motion and help spread the impact force of walking and running activities to areas best suited for absorption.

  

Our specially designed heel cup delivers optimum stability, shock absorption and comfort. The “hole in the heel cup” design was created in collaboration with pedorthic experts to reduce heel raise. Reduced heel raise is a key feature that allows users of BASE insoles to keep the built-in or removable insoles of their current footwear. The ¾ shell delivers biomechanical neutrality, lessens pressure on the forefoot, and offers better stability. Purchase your pair here

  

(Note: iPhone and iPod touch available now. iPad and Android will be available by the summer). 8.5x11 sized sheet of paper is required to properly digitize your foot. Wiivv makes true comfort accessible to you for only $75 (MSRP) per pair of custom insoles. Purchase your pair here

 



 We enlisted a group of 100 superheroes in our West Coast community to stress-test and fine-tune the product we bring to market. We put a specific focus on people who spend full days on their feet as part of their work - we call them “the industrial athletes”. The group of people tested include Olympic athletes, firefighters, servers, nurses, and film industry veterans. Purchase your pair here

 
  

Function always comes first, but style matters too. We invested in the details of our product, from your name engraved on the bottom of your Wiivvs to the variety of beautifully designed top layers. Purchase your pair here

  4 base colors. 


  8 top sheet patterns and colors.


  

Led by Wiivv's own biomechanics team, BASE’s development was done in partnership with experts in the fields of sports medicine and orthopedics in the effort to create the ultimate custom insole. The team identified and improved on critical design features that affect insole comfort and effectiveness, such as the medial/lateral arch shape and offset, insole contour and thickness, shock absorbing heel pad, cushioning top layer, insole length and shape to maximize flexibility in 1st MPJ joint, and heel cup shape and depth.


  







  

BASE fills the wide gap in the product offerings available between a corrective orthotic and an off-the-shelf insole. Corrective orthotics are usually custom, but are costly. Off-the-shelf insoles have lower price points, but they do not fit your unique contours. Purchase your pair here

  


  

Our design process went through a year of R&D that resulted in 8 generations of feature sets and an astounding 72 product iterations. Having vigorously tested our product and the viability of our platform, we are unique in our ability to fulfill orders shortly after receiving your photos. The Wiivv platform is all about on-demand customization. Giving backers access to our product in record-time is just another application of that philosophy.

<p>We have taken all of the most desirable features found in the best current 3D printers and have combined them into one unit. And if you are new to 3D printing, no problem, anybody can use CraftBot, especially when accompanied by CraftWare, our very own 3D software that is absolutely free to download at any time. Check it out yourself! CraftBot works right out of the box, all you need to do is load your 3D model, slice it with our state-of-the-art software and print it.</p>
<p>We have already began the production of CraftBot. Your contributions will aid us to manufacture this high quality product (using only the best components) in greater quantities, therefore decreasing the cost of each individual unit.</p>
<p>We have designed and developed every part of our printer from the ground up. We started by using the best quality steel and aluminium. CraftBot is assembled with the utmost precision, keeping in mind that the printer head must make very fine movements. CraftBot utilizes quality laser cut metal parts and CNC milled components to achieve a higher standard of 3D printing.</p>
<p>The tests have gone out and the results are in. In comparison with other approaches nowadays, this pathway is an obvious plus for youths growing up in a world of technology. It helps them to learn computer skill in a more constructive way. It's fun and educational for children at the same time. Its a catalyst for creativity. We've personally placed CraftBot and CraftWare in the hands of children, and the results were outstanding.  Specifically, we tested our products through a teacher at an elementary school and the kids couldn't get enough of it.  At home or in a classroom environment, CraftBot and CraftWare stand alone.<br/></p>

</div>
<h3>Size does matter!</h3>
<p>Most people do not want to print chairs for ants. If you intend to make more practical prints think twice before purchasing a tiny sized 3D printer. CraftBot is capable of printing large objects (250x200x200 mm, approx. 10x8x8 in). CraftBot has one of the biggest build volume in its class.</p>
<h3>Heatable build platform, no bending or warping</h3>
<p>3D printing material shrinks as it cools down, therefore 3D printed objects tends to bend or warp during the printing process, causing the printer head to collide with the object, ultimately ruining the print. To overcome this problem we have designed our printer with a heatable build platform. Of course, it requires a stronger power supply that increases the total manufacturing cost, which is why most of our lower-priced competitors do not use it.</p>
<h3>Removable platform</h3>
<p>We have eliminated the unnecessary injuries caused by reaching into the machine to remove the finished object. The easy solution: a removable build platform.</p>
<h3>Touchscreen LCD</h3>
<p>Most of our competitors use a 4x20 matrix non-graphical display that is difficult to operate. CraftBot uses a 2.8” QVGA LCD touchscreen, which makes it very easy to control the printer.</p>
<h3>Custom electronics</h3>
<p>The heart of CraftBot lies in its electronics. Our goal was to achieve dual channel communication allowing the user to immediately interact with the printer. We used the best quality electronic parts and made several prototypes until we arrived at one that we were satisfied with. <br/></p>

<h3>CraftWare, our free software</h3>
<p>CraftWare is an all in one advanced slicer software written by us from scratch. Slicing is an essential part of 3D printing as it is the process that turns your digital 3D model into the toolpath information understood by 3D printers. An algorithm which generates such a toolpath must be smart enough to provide the most precise pathway for the best possible results and quality. Shorter build time also can be achieved using good toolpath information. With CraftWare you can interactively and easily build custom non-vertical support bars (see video below). With CraftWare, you can also attempt to print non-watertight objects.</p>

</div>
<h3>Material &amp; Filament options</h3>
<p>PLA (Poly Lactic Acid) is probably the best non-toxic material to get you started with 3D printing. The material cools and sets very quickly with the aid of the CraftBot's two on-board fans. This means that you can achieve a wide range of shapes that would be difficult to print with other materials. You can use any 1.75mm PLA or ABS filament spool available on the market. Choose the one that best fits your budget. Now this is important, because as you will see in the comparison chart, most of our competitors use proprietary filament which is significantly more expensive! Proprietary filament is a custom filament which must be used to fit a specific machine. Don't be tricked, they are designed to create another source of income for the company.</p>

We've personally placed CraftBot and CraftWare in the hands of children, and the results were outstanding.  Specifically, we tested our products through a teacher at an elementary school and the kids couldn't get enough of it.  At home or in a classroom environment, CraftBot and CraftWare stand alone.



Size does matter!
Most people do not want to print chairs for ants. If you intend to make more practical prints think twice before purchasing a tiny sized 3D printer. CraftBot is capable of printing large objects (250x200x200 mm, approx. 10x8x8 in). CraftBot has one of the biggest build volume in its class.
Heatable build platform, no bending or warping
3D printing material shrinks as it cools down, therefore 3D printed objects tends to bend or warp during the printing process, causing the printer head to collide with the object, ultimately ruining the print. To overcome this problem we have designed our printer with a heatable build platform. Of course, it requires a stronger power supply that increases the total manufacturing cost, which is why most of our lower-priced competitors do not use it.
Removable platform
We have eliminated the unnecessary injuries caused by reaching into the machine to remove the finished object. The easy solution: a removable build platform.
Touchscreen LCD
Most of our competitors use a 4x20 matrix non-graphical display that is difficult to operate. CraftBot uses a 2.8” QVGA LCD touchscreen, which makes it very easy to control the printer.
Custom electronics
The heart of CraftBot lies in its electronics. Our goal was to achieve dual channel communication allowing the user to immediately interact with the printer. We used the best quality electronic parts and made several prototypes until we arrived at one that we were satisfied with. 



Compatibility
CraftBot also understands a standard command set, which means that it can be controlled by CraftWare or with other software of your choice.

CraftWare, our free software
CraftWare is an all in one advanced slicer software written by us from scratch. Slicing is an essential part of 3D printing as it is the process that turns your digital 3D model into the toolpath information understood by 3D printers. An algorithm which generates such a toolpath must be smart enough to provide the most precise pathway for the best possible results and quality. Shorter build time also can be achieved using good toolpath information. With CraftWare you can interactively and easily build custom non-vertical support bars (see video below). With CraftWare, you can also attempt to print non-watertight objects.




Material & Filament options
PLA (Poly Lactic Acid) is probably the best non-toxic material to get you started with 3D printing. The material cools and sets very quickly with the aid of the CraftBot's two on-board fans. This means that you can achieve a wide range of shapes that would be difficult to print with other materials. You can use any 1.75mm PLA or ABS filament spool available on the market. Choose the one that best fits your budget. Now this is important, because as you will see in the comparison chart, most of our competitors use proprietary filament which is significantly more expensive! Proprietary filament is a custom filament which must be used to fit a specific machine. Don't be tricked, they are designed to create another source of income for the company.

Perks



Stretch goals
We are reaching our goals, and this makes all of us at CraftUnique very happy!  Now let's talk about ""Stretch Goals"", or goals set beyond the initial goal and the incentives there-after. We feel that the CraftBot, considering the components that go into making it, is already being sold at a very generous price.
But... We are proposing the idea to install anodized aluminum parts on one of the immediate new batches to come.  We are also planning to increase the color selection of the printers from 4 to 8 when we pass our $100,000 barrier!



Risks and challenges
We do not like to wait for something, do you? The good news is that we already began production of the first hundred machines! After our campaign ends, allow us one-month break until we arrange the final steps and we start sending out the first 100 pieces for our VIP backers. If you are late, you are not! All of our backers will receive their printer in this calendar year!
We have arranged everything with our suppliers, they know about our campaign as well. We have discussed the best shipping options with FedEx, our logistics partner, to make the shipping as smooth as possible.
International shipping
Shipping costs vary by location and country. To keep the shipping costs as low as possible for you, we have made a contract with FedEx and will charge the costs individually. Based on your location you can roughly estimate the shipping cost if you click here. After the campaign we will send you a survey and at this time you can give us your address details.



Disclaimer
The printed figures are only used to demonstrate that CraftBot can print various objects. We do not sell the printed figures. We respect the intellectual property rights of the authors and owners. Please, notify us if you find any prints that do not properly identify the author or potentially infringe any rights of the owners. We will take proper measures to resolve the issues.

FAQ
How much do I pay for shipping?
We provide an individual shipping cost for everyone. Please visit http://www.craftbot3d.com where you can roughly estimate the shipping cost to send 1 pcs of CraftBot and 1kg of PLA filament. Shipping will be calculated and collected when we send the backer survey. This will be just before your rewards are sent to ensure the fairest shipping rates.
How much VAT (Value Added Tax) will I have to pay if I am located outside of the European Union?
Because we are based in the European Union (EU), we won’t charge VAT to customers living outside the EU.
How much VAT (Value Added Tax) will I have to pay if I am in the European Union?
Because we are based in the European Union (EU), we need to charge a VAT rate of 27% for backers within the EU. After the successful conclusion of the campaign, we will contact you by email for the exact location you want your CraftBot to be shipped. If the location is inside the EU, we will send you a request to pay the 27% VAT before shipping. Once you have fulfilled that request we will send out your package as soon as possible. If you live outside the EU (for instance the USA or Canada) we won’t charge VAT. Local VAT and import tax might be applicable to you. Your country's local customs department will collect the import tax and VAT if necessary.*
How do I request a printer color and/or a filament color?
When the Indiegogo campaign ends, we will send everyone a survey asking them exactly what they want. We would like your feedback too during the campaign as we finalize the filament color options.
How do I add extra filaments to my pledge?
Please select ""PLA filament supply"" perk. Please note that shipping is calculated by weight, so the backers who want an extra roll may need to pay a little more for shipping.
Which operating systems does CraftWare run on?
The software works with Windows 7 at the moment. We are currently working on the OSX release.
Can I use the CraftBot 3D printer with other operating system than Windows?
Yes, all mayor operating systems are supported by CraftBot.
Can I use the CraftBot 3D printer with other software like pronterface?
Yes, you can use CraftBot with pronterface.

<p>While a microcredit loan is the main benefit that a microfinance institution (MFI) can offer its members, many MFIs around the world are beginning to introduce additional services, such as savings facilities. We want to build an Android app for use by MFIs to safely accept savings deposits from their members in the field. We hope the security of cash transactions will encourage more savings deposits from members, which will build upon one of the foundations of successful MFIs - promoting self-sufficiency through savings.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Microfinance has been an effective initiative in tackling poverty. In Bangladesh, research has shown that 48% of members of MFIs manage to rise above the poverty line. In contrast, only 4% of those who don't borrow from MFIs escape poverty. The main benefit that these institutions provide is the microcredit loan. These loans provide the capital that members need to grow their businesses and to start up new ones at reasonable levels of interest.</p>
<p>Besides lending money, many MFIs have found other ways to help their members succeed. One MFI in Indonesia, Koperasi Kasih Indonesia (KKI), has an education program which promotes the importance of savings. Since starting operations in December 2011 in Cilincing, one of Jakarta’s poorest sub-districts with over 19,000 households living below the poverty line, KKI has disbursed over USD 1.5 million helping 10,660 women and their families. With almost all of its members unbankable, KKI offers a savings facility which has become the only way for many of them to save. This deposit service has been very successful with savings among its members growing at 22% per annum. KKI’s field operations are currently conducted on paper. With its number of members growing in excess of 60% per year, KKI needed a way to maintain or even improve the momentum in the growth of savings while reducing the risk of error or fraud.</p>

<p></p>
<h3>Our Solution</h3>
<p>After several meetings with KKI’s founder, Leonardo Kamilius, we looked to technology for a solution - an Android app used by field officers to collect savings deposits. Field officers will input the savings deposit amounts into the mobile app. When the amounts are confirmed, the data will be sent to a mobile printer via Bluetooth, which will print out a receipt that is given to the members. Additionally, the amounts of the deposits will be directly uploaded to KKI’s cloud-based information system. These features will have several positive effects:</p>

<h3>What is this? </h3>
<p>With the Transform The Smartphone Challenge, adding batteries, headphone jacks, and Qi wireless charging are the most common features across them. <br/><br/>While it is great that they do have them, it's annoying that these standard features are using the MotoMod expandability. That is where the Mod Compatible Battery comes in. </p>
<p>Everyone is so focused (myself included) on the capabilities of the Moto Mod platform, that they ignored the standard features of the device; the USB C port. This port provides the ability to add all of those features, without sacrificing the MotoMod platform!</p>
<p>So what have we done? We have designed what is essentially a standard battery pack case that most other phones have. Providing room for a 2100mAh battery, Qi Wireless Charging, USB- C Passthrough, and bringing back the forgotten headphone jack. Utilizing components, this keeps production costs down, development time down, and most importantly - your investment down.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Show us what you got!</h3>
<p>Another eye opener from the Transform The Smartphone Contest is the lack of commitment. Forums, posts, websites everywhere ask and say the MotoMod platform is lacking unique and inventive ideas. </p>
<p>This is a mod that would be easily adapted to future phones, Motorola or otherwise. While loss from investment from within is not as big of a deal, it is important to see the interest is there for this type of option. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>All it takes is $1 and a dream</h3>
<p>This is why I am limiting this to $1 for 'perk' items. This is not pre ordering an actual product at the moment, just to get proper interest and feedback as to whether or not this is an avenue worth our time. </p>

<p>Intrigued by the idea? Share this page, donate $1.00, buy 100 perks to really show how much you want it, and we will make it happen. </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><span><b>Q and A </b></span></h2> <p><b>Q: What about shipping fees, duties and taxes?</b><br/>A: The pledge for Beam includes all shipment costs. Backers from Europe and the United States of America will not have to pay any duties and/or taxes.</p>
<p><b>Q: Can I adjust my screen?</b><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">A: We made sure that you can rotate the image without loosening Beam in the light socket. When you rotate the outer ring you can adjust the image with 180° this combined with the 180° software screen rotation allows for a full 360° movement.</span></p>
<p><b>Q: What devices can i use to control Beam?</b><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">A: You can control Beam with an iOS (iPhone and iPad), Android device (phone or tablet) or with any device that has a web browser, like Windows (Phone), Mac or Linux. You can also control Beam with a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard to enjoy its full potential. Next to the standard Beam functionality, you can even do more with third party apps, like Team Viewer to mirror your Windows screen, DLNA server apps to send media to Beam and lots more.</span></p>
<p><b>Q: Is the brightness of 100 lumen enough?</b><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">A: Beam has ANSI 100 Lumen. During development we added a brightness adjustment because it was too bright in some instances. With 100 Lumen you can easily see what Beam projects during daytime when you are inside.</span></p>
<p><b>Q: What is the maximum size of the projection?</b><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">A: Beam can project up to 120-inch widescreen.</span></p>
<p><b>Q: How large will the projection area be when I place Beam 6ft (1.8m) from a wall?</b><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">A: The throw ratio of Beam is 1.6:1 (distance:width). That means that for every 1.6ft distance, the projection will become 1ft larger. So at a distance of 6ft your screen will be 3.75ft (1.1m).</span></p>
<p><b>Q: Does Beam work on my country’s voltage level?</b><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">A: Beam works on 110VAC up to 240VAC, this covers all countries standard power line voltage levels.</span></p>
<p><b>Q: Will i get the right plug for my country?</b><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">A: We will make sure that you will receive the correct power plug.</span></p>
<p><b>Q: Will Beam work in any light socket?</b><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">A: Beam has an E26/E27 thread. But this can be easily converted to any light socket connection that you want (e.g. gu10, E14) by using an adapter. You can find these adapters online (just search for “E27 to “x” adapter”) or in your local hardware store.</span></p>
<p><b>Q: What are the dimensions and weight of Beam?</b><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">A: Beam has a diameter of 4.5 inch (11cm) and is around 6 inches (15cm) tall. It weighs around 0.9 pounds (400 grams)</span></p>
<p><b>Q: Always on? Does that mean Beam uses lots of electricity?</b><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">A: No, always on means it goes into standby mode when not projecting. In standby Beam only uses 3 Watts, that’s half of what your TV set-top box uses when it’s on standby! When it is projecting it only uses 9 Watts.</span></p>
<p><b>Q: Does Beam get really hot after projecting for a while?</b><br/>A: Beam is actively cooled by a slowly rotating, very silent fan, so it doesn’t get hot.</p>
<p><b>Q: Does Beam make a lot of noise?</b><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">A: Beam has a LED projector and therefore requires less intensive cooling than traditional lamp projectors.

something REVOLUTIONARY in this field. So we didn`t want to carry on the
traditional way of 3D visual innovations by creating better and better 3D
glasses or virtual head sets. We took the hard way and we developed
specially engineered elements integrated directly into the layers of the

3D glasses or any other additional gadgets are not needed anymore.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472457136/bekezd%C3%A9sk%C3%B6zti4_x3yffg.png"" src="""" style=""width: 581.811px;height: 188px;""/></p><p><br/></p><h3><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>REVOLUTIONARY NEW 3D TECNOLOGY</b></span></h3><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p><p></p><h5><br/></h5>Our eyes

Applying this extra layer directly into the phone. Thus the whole screen itself becomes a Real 3 Dimensional Ultra High Quality Display. After this innovation 3D glasses are not needed because this Real 3D Display does all the work by itself including delivering color-segmented frames separately to your left and right eyes.<div><br/></div><div>

<br/><div>The special geometry surface of an added extra polymer layer decodes the color segmentation so that each eye sees only what was designed for it to see, creating a perception of depth. The Right Eye image is specially segmented, matching the prism's Right side of the polymer surface. This lets only the Right image to be visible. The Left Eye image is segmented differently, matching the prism's Left side of the polymer surface. This lets only the Left image to be visible. The display switches between the Left and Right eye image at up to 100 frames per second alternately segmenting each frame.     <br/><p></p>

Is
it what all of us was waiting for? ...once if you hold an Alienline device in
your hands the answer will definitely YES! 
At Alienline we decided to create
something REVOLUTIONARY in this field. So we didn`t want to carry on the
traditional way of 3D visual innovations by creating better and better 3D
glasses or virtual head sets. We took the hard way and we developed
specially engineered elements integrated directly into the layers of the
display. The result is a brand new jaw-dropping 3D visual technology where
3D glasses or any other additional gadgets are not needed anymore.REVOLUTIONARY NEW 3D TECNOLOGYOur eyes 
deliever two different pictures from two different angles continouasly to 
our brain. (Left and Right) The human brain synthesizes these two images
 into a single image creating a perception of depth. We designed a polymer layer with specially engineered surface. Applying this extra layer directly into the phone. Thus the whole screen itself becomes a Real 3 Dimensional Ultra High Quality Display. After this innovation 3D glasses are not needed because this Real 3D Display does all the work by itself including delivering color-segmented frames separately to your left and right eyes.


The special geometry surface of an added extra polymer layer decodes the color segmentation so that each eye sees only what was designed for it to see, creating a perception of depth. The Right Eye image is specially segmented, matching the prism's Right side of the polymer surface. This lets only the Right image to be visible. The Left Eye image is segmented differently, matching the prism's Left side of the polymer surface. This lets only the Left image to be visible. The display switches between the Left and Right eye image at up to 100 frames per second alternately segmenting each frame.     







Alienline 3D smartphones and tablet PCs are designed
to allow you to comfortably watch a movie while reducing ghosting and image blur,
which are side effect previously experienced with any kind of 3D glasses. And as
an extra feature you can also enjoy our newly developed 3D operating platform
specially designed for Android users.

<p><b>What is DreamMe?</b><br/></p>
<p>With the DreamMe hardware and app you keep 
up to date with time and other information, right on the ceiling of your
 sleeping room. DreamMe hardware does not require batteries or 
cumbersome coupling to your smartphone or tablet, as the hardware uses a
 special optical system to show the information from your smartphone 
right on the ceiling of your darkened room. </p>
<p><b><i>Start the app - set DreamMe onto your smartphone / tablet - stay tuned @ night!</i></b><br/></p>
<b>How it works:</b><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F139724585&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F139724585&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F535705032_1280.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/>While the phone is charging on the nightstand, DreamMe uses it to 
project parts of the display onto your room ceiling. Simply place 
DreamMe onto the display. The app ensures the appropriate placement and 
allows to choose different categories of information to be displayed.  
The user decides himself whether DreamMe is solely used as ""projection 
alarm clock"", or indicates your new mail messages and the weather 
report. The app also provides help for those who like to count sheep to 
fall asleep. Thus, DreamMe´s sympathic sheep even convert your 
smartphone to a sleeping aid.<br/><br/><b>The smartphone apps:</b><br/>
</div>The app is responsible for displaying the information with increased 
brightness and contrast. Additionally it will mirror the information for
 the optical system, so the information is clearly visible on the 
darkened room ceiling.<br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F139711756&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F139711756&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F535692664_1280.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><b>App functionality: </b><br/><ul>

</div><br/></div>","What is DreamMe?
With the DreamMe hardware and app you keep 
up to date with time and other information, right on the ceiling of your
 sleeping room. DreamMe hardware does not require batteries or 
cumbersome coupling to your smartphone or tablet, as the hardware uses a
 special optical system to show the information from your smartphone 
right on the ceiling of your darkened room. 
Start the app - set DreamMe onto your smartphone / tablet - stay tuned @ night!
How it works:While the phone is charging on the nightstand, DreamMe uses it to 
project parts of the display onto your room ceiling. Simply place 
DreamMe onto the display. The app ensures the appropriate placement and 
allows to choose different categories of information to be displayed.  
The user decides himself whether DreamMe is solely used as ""projection 
alarm clock"", or indicates your new mail messages and the weather 
report. The app also provides help for those who like to count sheep to 
fall asleep. Thus, DreamMe´s sympathic sheep even convert your 
smartphone to a sleeping aid.The smartphone apps:
The app is responsible for displaying the information with increased 
brightness and contrast. Additionally it will mirror the information for
 the optical system, so the information is clearly visible on the 
darkened room ceiling.App functionality: 
Display the local time and date
Display the local weather (temperature and cloudiness) 
Display your own message 
""Sheep counting"" will help you to fall asleep 
Alarm clock and auto on / off 
Display time in additional time zones (pro upgrade) 
Display weather in other cities (pro upgrade) 
Show number of unread mails (pro upgrade) 
Show the latest Twitter tweet (pro upgrade)
iOS and Android versions available for free in app stores (with optional pro upgrade)
DreamMe live in action:Black DreamMe with white focus ring working on Android smartphone.
 Settings: Additional time zone ""NEW YORK"" - weather additional city 
""NEW YORK"" - custom text ""ON"" - sheep counting ""ON"".As you 
can imagine, it is not easy to capture the working DreamMe as the 
capability of current cameras is limited in darkness. We tried our best 
to give you an impression of how DreamMe is projecting. Please keep in 
mind that our eyes are X times better than a camera...Design - from the beginning to the final:DreamMe features a simple and stylish design. It not only fits perfectly to your 
nightstand, it establishes a perfect symbiosis with your smartphone - 
real bros & sis. Compact size and low weight make it a perfect 
companion on your next trip. It follows you through the night to keep 
you up to date.When DreamMe and your smartphone get to know each other - this will be more than just a one night stand! :-)The two identical parts, of which the upper one  carries the optics, 
have the exact same contour and sit mirrored to each other, which is why
 in silhouette they form a shapely cylinder that keeps its symmetry even
 when it is unscrewed to adjust the picture sharpness. Considering its 
aesthetics, it is almost a pity it is being used in the dark.
The base is available in two colors, black and white. In active use the 
colored focus ring separates the upper and lower parts with a subtle 
light band. 
The selected material not only is non-slip and extremely lightweight but
 also offers comfortable haptics preventing scratches.Some more insight on the DreamMe Design:The
 design was created by Uwe Spannagel TM. I know Uwe since more than 20 
years and after my first on tries on the design (see pictures above) I 
decided that DreamMe needs something more professional. This is when I 
contacted Uwe.
Here is some more background on: Uwe Spannagel TM is an office for industrial design, founded in Cologne 
in 1995 by Uwe Spannagel after working for Henry Dreyfuss Associates in 
New York City and Phoenix Design in Stuttgart.  He converts 
limitations into innovations. 
He transforms technical complexity into tranquillity and beauty. The 
result is an elegant, self-evident design that people want not just to 
use but consciously to possess.Feel free to contact him if you are looking for a clean and elegant new design: http://uwespannagel.com/en/

<b>WHERE DESIGN MEETS CONVENIENCE</b> </h1>
<div data-id=""1805466"">
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463562928/design_meets_convenience_njqohr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;"">The Solartab started out with a basic idea: How can we create a powerful and environmentally friendly charger that people want to use all the time? To us, it was important to create a product that people would embrace as one of their favorite belongings. And add to their their list of essentials that they always take with them, every time they leave home.

  </figure>
</div>
<p>Drawing from our previous experience with solar panels, professionally and as consumers, we knew that we wanted a bigger solar panel. Something that could truly charge your devices efficiently. Too many solar chargers on the market today feature solar panels that simply are too small –  barely strong enough to charge an iPhone within a reasonable amount of time. We wanted to create a solar charger strong enough to effectively charge even devices like the iPad. A charger that would allow its user to be mobile everywhere, anytime.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472479593/e0a772c11662472a0c46c4f899866397_original_pe5ub1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">So we increased the size and the quality of the 5.5W solar panel, way above what you’ll find on the average charger on the market today. And already after our quick initial research and drafts we found that we could still create a slim, light and perfectly portable product. A product that would still be the size of a magazine. Or your tablet.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We couldn’t find a solar charger on the market that did everything we wanted, so we decided to design one. And after a lot of work, we managed to make our dream product a reality: A charger more powerful, reliable, good looking and portable than anything out there! After all, why should solar power be an inconvenient gimmick? We believe solar power should rather be a fully integrated part of your daily life.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>

<br/><p></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We wanted to create a solar charger featuring beautiful and smart design. A robust aluminium frame encloses the Solartab's highly efficient solar panel, giving the product its clean, minimalist look. The cover is made out of soft, high grade polyurethane, which is both durable and water resistant – so don’t worry about placing it on wet grass. An elegant elastic band and strong magnets hold the cover firmly closed, while adding to the Solartab’s irresistible and timeless notebook look. And make sure it will stay closed and safe when you put it in your bag.</span></p>
<p>But there is more. Since solar panels can only fully release their potential when sunlight hits them as directly as possible, we designed the cover to also serve as a stand, which always ensures maximum efficiency. Thanks to the stand’s three different positions, the Solartab’s solar panel can always be adjusted to the current position of the sun.</p>

This means you can charge your devices even after the sun has set! As long as you let it soak up sun during the day until it’s full, the internal battery will always be able to provide a full charge on any iPad – or SEVEN full charges on an iPhone 6S! With the Solartab, you’ve always got complete independence in all your charging needs.</span></p></span></figure>

<p>Through our long and thorough product development process, we constantly strived to design a product that would truly change the way you perceive and use solar chargers. Through our uncompromising and perfectionist approach, all the way from early sketches to physical prototypes to the final product, we believe we have made the Solartab the best portable solar charger there is. It combines efficient solar charging with an attractive and smart design. The result is a truly unique product that will become your trusted everyday companion. Power everywhere!</p>

The Solartab is unlike any other product on the market today. A truly unique solar charger – featuring great design, a powerful 5.5 W solar panel, a massive 13 000 mAh internal battery and a built-in cover that ensures maximum sun exposure at all times. Solartab: the solar charger you’ll want to take with you everywhere you go!




Check out our video (above) to see what the Solartab looks like in action!







MEET THE SOLARTAB 





Enjoy efficient portable solar power day or night with the Solartab. Charge your phone, tablet and all other USB powered devices anywhere and anytime! Featuring a 5.5 W solar panel and a 13,000 mAh battery. And powerful dual 2A USB ports – charge your iPhone 6S in 2 hours and iPad Air 2 in 4 hours!
A premium solar chargerThe Solartab is unlike any other portable solar charging or backup battery solution on the market. A truly unique product featuring great design, a high-capacity internal battery and a built-in cover that ensures maximum sun exposure at all times. And a solar panel large and powerful enough to charge even your tablet. 



Solar power everywhereWhether in the park, at the beach, at a music festival or out trekking, Solartab always lets you enjoy free and endless solar power! Simply open up the Solartab to start solar charging either the internal battery or or USB devices like your phone or tablet. Thanks to Solartab’s huge internal battery, you can even charge your devices after the sun sets!



Compatible with ALL USB devices
Not all solar chargers are created equal. Standard solar chargers can only communicate effectively with and charge certain devices. Thanks to the Solartab’s built-in intelligent charging circuitry, each of the two USB ports can communicate with the attached device, such as your iPhone or Android phone, and thereby always charge at the maximum possible rate. So plug in any USB device to your Solartab, any brand or model, and enjoy compatibility that doesn't limit your charging speed. Charge your iPhone 6S in 2 hours and iPad Air 2 in 4 hours!
A unique coverThe Solartab’s unique built-in cover gives it a stunning and nostalgic look, and protects the solar panel when it’s tucked away in your bag. But the cover also works as a stand for the solar panel, so you can angle the panel in three different positions. Find the right angle for maximum exposure to sunlight, plug in your device, and start charging!

HERE ARE A FEW SITUATIONS WHEN YOU CAN USE YOUR SOLARTAB:




•	The beach•	On a rooftop•	Your favorite café•	Music festivals•	When hiking•	On a boat•	A clearance in the middle of the forest•	At picnics
•	On savannahs or the outback•	In your backyard with some brews •	On a desert island•	At outdoor parties •	On the Great Wall of China•	In your grandma’s orchard 


WHERE DESIGN MEETS CONVENIENCE 


The Solartab started out with a basic idea: How can we create a powerful and environmentally friendly charger that people want to use all the time? To us, it was important to create a product that people would embrace as one of their favorite belongings. And add to their their list of essentials that they always take with them, every time they leave home.

  

Drawing from our previous experience with solar panels, professionally and as consumers, we knew that we wanted a bigger solar panel. Something that could truly charge your devices efficiently. Too many solar chargers on the market today feature solar panels that simply are too small –  barely strong enough to charge an iPhone within a reasonable amount of time. We wanted to create a solar charger strong enough to effectively charge even devices like the iPad. A charger that would allow its user to be mobile everywhere, anytime.



So we increased the size and the quality of the 5.5W solar panel, way above what you’ll find on the average charger on the market today. And already after our quick initial research and drafts we found that we could still create a slim, light and perfectly portable product. A product that would still be the size of a magazine. Or your tablet.

We couldn’t find a solar charger on the market that did everything we wanted, so we decided to design one. And after a lot of work, we managed to make our dream product a reality: A charger more powerful, reliable, good looking and portable than anything out there! After all, why should solar power be an inconvenient gimmick? We believe solar power should rather be a fully integrated part of your daily life.





We wanted to create a solar charger featuring beautiful and smart design. A robust aluminium frame encloses the Solartab's highly efficient solar panel, giving the product its clean, minimalist look. The cover is made out of soft, high grade polyurethane, which is both durable and water resistant – so don’t worry about placing it on wet grass. An elegant elastic band and strong magnets hold the cover firmly closed, while adding to the Solartab’s irresistible and timeless notebook look. And make sure it will stay closed and safe when you put it in your bag.
But there is more. Since solar panels can only fully release their potential when sunlight hits them as directly as possible, we designed the cover to also serve as a stand, which always ensures maximum efficiency. Thanks to the stand’s three different positions, the Solartab’s solar panel can always be adjusted to the current position of the sun.

On top of that we have equipped the Solartab with a powerful 13,000 mAh internal battery. This means you can charge your devices even after the sun has set! As long as you let it soak up sun during the day until it’s full, the internal battery will always be able to provide a full charge on any iPad – or SEVEN full charges on an iPhone 6S! With the Solartab, you’ve always got complete independence in all your charging needs.






Through our long and thorough product development process, we constantly strived to design a product that would truly change the way you perceive and use solar chargers. Through our uncompromising and perfectionist approach, all the way from early sketches to physical prototypes to the final product, we believe we have made the Solartab the best portable solar charger there is. It combines efficient solar charging with an attractive and smart design. The result is a truly unique product that will become your trusted everyday companion. Power everywhere!


JOIN US: TAKE ENERGY INTO YOUR OWN HANDS, AND BRING IT WITH YOU EVERYWHERE 




For today's young technology enthusiasts enjoying an active, modern and versatile lifestyle, having constant access to phones and tablets is nothing less than essential. And as technology to an ever greater degree leaves the comfort and the power outlets of one’s home, the demand for alternate power sources increases.

Our generation is also an environmentally conscious one. We bear great responsibility upon our shoulders: As it becomes ever more clear how unsustainable the power consumption of previous generations has been, we are constantly on the lookout for more environmentally friendly solutions to our ever increasing energy needs. Using solar power to an increasing degree is exactly the direction we should be heading.





By the end of the day, it is up to us individuals to change the world. And the fact is, we’re currently in the middle of a revolution that empowers the individual in many different fields – slowly weakening what previously used to be the rock-hard centres of power, one step at a time.
""Energy has traditionally been generated centrally, distributed over power lines and sold to consumers. (…)The Edison Electric Institute (EEI), a trade group, warns that distributed generation could do to energy companies what the internet did to newspapers."" – The Economist on solar power




We’re living in an exciting age. Since fairly recently, the computer and the internet have made it possible for anyone to record music or videos, or write books, and distribute them on their own. Right from their personal tablet or laptop computer, and out to the whole wide world. We are in no way as dependent on the big record companies, movie studios publishing houses as we were just a few years ago.

In the same way, the influx of 3D printers is bound to shift production of all kinds of goods from giant factories to the comfort of our homes. And the solar power revolution will take ever more power from the big energy companies, and give each individual the ability to take advantage of the sun fuelled energy present right outside his or her doorstep. Free yourself from the power outlets of your home, and let the Solartab follow you and your smartphone or tablet everywhere – never running out of energy. It’s green, it’s free, and it gives us the freedom we require.

<p>You can Scan &amp; Beep a Lapa up to 200 feet (60m) in
line of sight. This distance can be shorter depending on the environment. But
because every Lapa you own connects you to the vast Lapa network, you can
virtually track it anywhere. Anytime another user passes by your Lapa, they
will update its position.</p>
<p><b>How long does Lapa's battery last?</b></p>
<p>Lapa lasts 1 year running on a single battery, which
can be easily replaced.</p>
<p><b>What kind of battery does Lapa use?</b></p>

<p><b>Is Lapa's battery replaceable?</b></p>
<p>Yes. To replace the battery, easily detach the bottom case
using Lapa’s opening mechanism.</p>
<p><b>Is Lapa waterproof?</b></p>
<p>Yes.  Whereas most devices choose between waterproofing
and a replaceable battery, Lapa's enclosed casing means that there's no need to
compromise as Lapa is waterproof.</p>

is Lapa?</b></p>
<p>Lapa is very robust, built to handle all kind of
shock and impact.</p>
<p><b>What mobile devices are compatible with the Lapa App?</b></p>

account on multiple phones.</p>
<p><b>Can I share
Lapa with other people?</b></p>
<p>Yes. You can share any Lapa with as many people as you
want.</p>
<p><b>Can other Lapa users scan and track my Lapas?</b></p>
<p>No. Unless you explicitly decide to share access to
your Lapas, or publicly report them as lost, only you can see where they are.</p>
<p><b>Do other Lapa users know when I pass by their Lapas?</b></p>
<p>No. No user in the Lapa network will know when he or
she passes by your Lapas, and neither will you know when you pass by theirs
(unless they explicitly share or report their Lapas as lost).</p>
<p><b>When I share a Lapa with someone else may both of us
interact with that Lapa?</b></p>
<p>Yes, but not simultaneously.</p>
<p><b>What countries will you ship to?</b></p>
<p>All of them. We’ll ship Lapa worldwide.</p>

</div></div>","Order now at findlapa.comWe lose things, all the time. It's a simple, every day problem
that deserves an equally simple yet efficient solution. That’s how Lapa was born.Lapa is a bluetooth tracker unlike any before it. Still, good enough isn't enough, so we turned a good gadget into a great gadget. Better in every way and engineered to keep up with an active lifestyle, with Lapa you’ll find your things, no matter what.Controlled entirely from an
app, Lapa uses Bluetooth to keep you connected to your things. Hang it from your
keys or stick it to your bag, and Lapa will keep your things safe during all
your adventures.


It’s been three years in the making. After a successful Lapa version 1, you told us what you wanted, what you needed to protect your belongings – and we made it happen.  We re-envisioned the Bluetooth Tracker, all the while considering the consumer experience first.

 




 Because it's attached to your things,
 Lapa's design is as important as its technology. Every inch, every line
 and every curve was thought out to combine maximum performance with an 
attractive look and feel.


The new Lapa maintains its original 
signature shape, but it's the added details that make it truly elegant 
and bold. Whether it’s to be attached to your keys, inside your wallet,  or hanging from your backpack, Lapa fits perfectly with your life, your 
style, and your things.










Lapa is waterproof and bi-injected with polycarbonate and EPDM – that is to say, it's ready for war. Tough against abrasion, Lapa takes its signature curvy design to a whole new level of endurance, keeping its shape and sleekness despite your wildest adventures.






Lapa responds to your call through sound and light. In your house or in the street, under the couch cushions or inside a purse, you just can’t miss it. And thanks to an incorporated LED, you’ll easily spot it, even in the dark. 




We've packed our latest technology into a device so small and so slim, it can be attached to any object and still maintain a clean, sleek look. In fact, Lapa is smaller than an Apple Watch and twice as slim.











Sometimes it’s not just things we’re afraid of losing. That's why we created the Lapa Bracelet - an accessory made especially for children. Parents will be warned anytime their child leaves their side.











Mobile applications should make your life easier. And the Lapa App does just that. With a stunning and intuitive user interface, navigation is beautifully simple. This because it was purposefully built to provide an exquisite user experience so that finding your misplaced things is as easy as 1, 2, 3.
Free and compatible with both iOS and Android.


Find misplaced things
Can't ever find your keys? Not a problem. Lapa will find your misplaced things no matter how far away. Inside a tiny apartment or a 3 bedroom house. Under the cushions or outside in the garden.


Find your misplaced phone
What if you misplace your phone? Because the connection goes both ways, finding your phone is as easy as pressing a button. Once clicked, Lapa will make your phone ring and light up so that you can find it. Even if it's set to silent mode.










Have some peace of mind
Are you the anxious kind? Want to make sure you have all your things with you? Lapa has your back. Whether you leave something behind, somebody takes it or even if “it” runs away, Lapa warns you whenever you and your belongings are separated.
With Lapa, you'll protect everything and everyone you can’t live without.



Can't remember where you left something?
Let's say you're at a restaurant, and realize you forgot your wallet. Luckily, the App remembers where you left it. The map shows your Lapa's last GPS position.


Lost something? Use Lapa community to extend your reach
Report your Lapa as lost and receive a notification every time a Lapa community member passes by it, updating its position on the map. You’ll extend your reach and track your things virtually anywhere.



Get your friends to help you out
Who better to help you than those who hang around the same places you do? You can post on Facebook about your lost things directly from the Lapa App and ask friends to keep an eye out. 


Get back lost things

Any user who goes near a lost object marked as public will know it’s lost and may contact its owner to return it. No need for a middle man or exasperating visits to Lost and Found offices. Easy, direct and immediate.

Geek Out V2+ ist ein kompakter DAC und Kopfhörerverstärker
welcher über den USB port an deinem Computer oder mobilem Gerät angeschlossen
wird.
Es unterstützt hochauflösende Musikdateien, so dass du näher
an deiner Musik dran bist, unabhängig in welchem Format es vorliegt.

Warum eine EU Kampagne?
Mit unseren ersten IndieGoGo US-Kampagnen, haben wir bereits einen immensen Erfolg gehabt und liefern heute noch die Geräte im InDemand-Status aus.
Mit der EU-Kampagne möchten wir an diesem Erfolg anknüpfen, aber auch gleichzeitig das neue Gehäuse der Geek Outs vorstellen.
Unsere 3D-Drucker Gehäuse waren zwar innovativ hinsichtlich Wärmeabfuhr und Aufbau, allerdings war die Haptik und die Oberfläche noch verbesserungswürdig.
Mit dieser Kampagne vertreiben wir nur noch die aktualisierte Version.
Das Video zeigt allerdings noch die alten Gehäuse


Geek Out V2+ ist ein Problemlöser.

<h1>iPhone 6S 3D Force Touch Compatible Glass.</h1>
<h3>Made with premium Tempered Glass!</h3>
<p><br/>This new tempered glass is made with premium glass materials which we purchased from a company that distributes the biggest brand in glass which rhymes with Morning Glass. :) Because they are very protective of their brand name and because we don't buy the materials directly from them we can't use their name in our marketing, but this material is super special and costs 10x more than standard raw materials. We buy the raw materials from one of their largest customers in Japan and then we use the finest materials and our finishing process uses the best technology to achieve absolutely stunning edge to edge protection. The only way for this material to be used for screen protection is to buy in the middle market since the 10 billion dollar company that makes such awesome glass has not yet worked directly with any screen protector businesses. (If they are looking for volunteers to pioneer the market with them we hope they call <a href=""http://kyasi.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.kyasi.com</a> first!)<br/><br/>For those screen protector experts (or Glass Nerds as we call ourselves) we want to point out that Kyasi's Gladiator Glass 3D tempered glass is made with <a href=""http://www.corninggorillaglass.com/en/videos/91"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">high alumina silica glass</a> like you see in the video which is linked. The raw materials are more than ten times the cost of the inferior <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soda-lime_glass"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">soda-lime tempered glass</a>. And what a lot of people don't know is that the edges of soda lime are actually curved by using a corrosive technique to eat away part of the glass towards the edges which forms the curved effect. These so called edge to edge glass solutions will not last as long as a nanotechnology based premium tempered glass. At Kyasi we are always focused on long term durability and customer satisfaction.</p>
<p><u><strong><em>The glass is compatible with the new iPhone 6S 3D Force Touch technology as well.</em></strong></u><br/><br/>This is a premium product and is absolutely the most beautiful protector ever made. Best of all it matches your device so perfectly that you probably won't even notice it is there, until the inevitable drop happens.</p>
<p>The Gladiator Glass 3D is also more compatible with more cases than other curved edge protectors. Although not every case with work with these curved edges most cases that we have tested appear to work just fine. Unlike some of the cheaper would be competitors who use only 2mm thickness we provide a full 4mm thickness for maximum protection. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Remember, we line up these perks to give you the inside track at a lower than retail price AND we back it with our commitment to unwavering support before and after the sale. How's that for awesomeness?</span></p>

</div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Your voice matters. We love it when customers share their experiences because it creates a hyper learning environment for us. Even experiences that are negative contribute highly to our ability to understand how the market will react to this innovative new concept. When a new device like the iPhone 6S comes out there is a lot of uncertainty about what will and won't work. By supporting us now we accelerate that learning ten times faster than a normal market release. Crowd funding supporters are absolutely on the inside track of trends and help us gauge consumer expectations going forward.</p>

<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> We have been around and launched many products so we are doing everything we can to mitigate the risks and overcome the challenges.</p> <ul> <li>However, like any new product the item may not hold up over time. We have tested for around 3 months and the product is superlative, however, after longer durations of time it's hard to say how the item will hold up. However, based on lab duration testing that simulates longer usage and our track record of high quality products we believe this is only a very limited risk. Using High Alumina Silica glass which is 10 times more expensive that the cheap soda-lime glass used by other ""edge to edge"" protectors is another way we believe that we are investing in the long term quality and limiting your risk.</li>
<li>Not all tight fitting cases are compatible.</li> <li>Our QUICKSHIP perks will ship quickly. If those quantities sell out then we will add other perks which will ship as they are produced. Each Perk will show an estimated ship timeframe. </li> </ul>

iPhone 6S 3D Force Touch Compatible Glass.
Made with premium Tempered Glass!
This new tempered glass is made with premium glass materials which we purchased from a company that distributes the biggest brand in glass which rhymes with Morning Glass. :) Because they are very protective of their brand name and because we don't buy the materials directly from them we can't use their name in our marketing, but this material is super special and costs 10x more than standard raw materials. We buy the raw materials from one of their largest customers in Japan and then we use the finest materials and our finishing process uses the best technology to achieve absolutely stunning edge to edge protection. The only way for this material to be used for screen protection is to buy in the middle market since the 10 billion dollar company that makes such awesome glass has not yet worked directly with any screen protector businesses. (If they are looking for volunteers to pioneer the market with them we hope they call www.kyasi.com first!)For those screen protector experts (or Glass Nerds as we call ourselves) we want to point out that Kyasi's Gladiator Glass 3D tempered glass is made with high alumina silica glass like you see in the video which is linked. The raw materials are more than ten times the cost of the inferior soda-lime tempered glass. And what a lot of people don't know is that the edges of soda lime are actually curved by using a corrosive technique to eat away part of the glass towards the edges which forms the curved effect. These so called edge to edge glass solutions will not last as long as a nanotechnology based premium tempered glass. At Kyasi we are always focused on long term durability and customer satisfaction.
The glass is compatible with the new iPhone 6S 3D Force Touch technology as well.This is a premium product and is absolutely the most beautiful protector ever made. Best of all it matches your device so perfectly that you probably won't even notice it is there, until the inevitable drop happens.
The Gladiator Glass 3D is also more compatible with more cases than other curved edge protectors. Although not every case with work with these curved edges most cases that we have tested appear to work just fine. Unlike some of the cheaper would be competitors who use only 2mm thickness we provide a full 4mm thickness for maximum protection. 
Remember, we line up these perks to give you the inside track at a lower than retail price AND we back it with our commitment to unwavering support before and after the sale. How's that for awesomeness?


   What You Get We have made perks for a number of options from a single pack to multipacks which increase your savings:  Our crowd funding goal is to help promote this new release worldwide and help customers with the new Apple iPhone 6S find a screen protector that fits all of their needs. Each perk will help us with future forecasting what models and sizes and colors will be popular since the crowdfunding community of early adopters is a leading indicator of market performance. All perks will be confirmed for the size, color and any other relevant details using a survey to each participant and orders will be shipped as soon as the campaign is funded. 



   The Impact Your voice matters. We love it when customers share their experiences because it creates a hyper learning environment for us. Even experiences that are negative contribute highly to our ability to understand how the market will react to this innovative new concept. When a new device like the iPhone 6S comes out there is a lot of uncertainty about what will and won't work. By supporting us now we accelerate that learning ten times faster than a normal market release. Crowd funding supporters are absolutely on the inside track of trends and help us gauge consumer expectations going forward.

I found the music about that came from it, great, the graphics where much more superior than the Apple IIC and the games that it came was equally fun and addicting.</p><p>    Then I came to Canada and was introduced to my very first Amiga system: Amiga 500. I found it to look equally sexy as the Commodore 64c, it had the Commodore name on it which at that time convinced me it was the new and improved C64. I loved the graphics output, the kickstart 1.3 interface and everything about it, Amiga computer have being passion when it came to the retro system of the past.  Then it hit me! Why not turn the Amiga classic into a portable console? After all, in my opinion the Amiga classic is a console and a computer combined. It had it's own custom chipset, it produced console quality graphics but unfortunately it lacked the portability of a console. It needs to be hooked into either a PAL or NTSC TV, and had to stay home..you cannot take the fun where ever you go.<br/></p><p><i> </i>  One might say what about gp2x, PSP, with Amiga emulator that runs games in these portable consoles? Doesn't this make it a redundancy since an emulator already exists? My answer to that is: No! Because unlike emulator this is the real deal? Do you consider an emulator a solution to the real hardware? Personally I would not spend 700 to 800 dollars on a real classic Amiga if I believed that the emulator will replace the actual hardware.</p><p>  However, this is more than just a tiny sized version of a classical Amiga this have new things and new features that you cannot find in the classical Amiga or emulator. Here are the following things that this provide over an emulator and the real machine:</p><p>  1) New custom chipset that follows the lines of the OCS, ECS, AGA with 1 GB CHIP RAM. It is called AGA-II.<br/></p><p>  2) New Paula chipset that is 32 bit quality sound but named differently, of course.</p><p>  3) The custom graphic chipset will have 3D ability that matches that of PS 2.</p><p>  4) Background compatibility with OCS/ECS/AGA graphics and allows you to transfer games between classical Amiga to this console and play directly on this console.</p><p>  5) Have new customized workbench that allows it to read and execute real Amiga games, apps, etc. It even allows you to execute games directly from adf.  In order to switch between different ADF images you just press and hold on the select button for couple of seconds, then a menu popup asking you to select the ADF. If you press the start/select button together and hold for couple of seconds it quits back to the main and back to home screen. It also allows you to switch to Amiga classical mode and take advantage of the new hardware this system offers. How? Simple.  In the root directory of the console you place your legal copy of kickstart 3.1,1.3,etc. In the OS of this console you select switch to classical mode. Then it asks you to select the kickstart version and it reboots and starts as a classical Amiga that takes advantage of the new hardware configuration (including the new custom chipset and CHIP RAM).<br/></p><p>  6) It have expansion port that allows you to use real keyboard, mouse, allows for composites, s-video, dvi-i, and hdmi port to hook to your TV. It supports all TV signals including: PAL/NTSC/SECAM, etc. The expansion also supports USB which allows you to use external HD, CD-ROM.<br/></p><p> 7) Audio filter on/off and power LED on/off based on audio filter is supported (like classical Amiga).<br/></p><p> 8) It have a 68060 running at 233 Mhz as the base CPU for classical Amiga mode and the kickstart of this console is build as hardware in it. The build in kickstart allows you to boot from HD USB, or CD-ROM which gives you the the advantage to switch to classical mode, and have a new customized Amiga system that takes advantage of the new hardware configuration. <br/></p><p> 9) Allows you to play movies, mp3, browse the net, watch youtube, etc. Which means it supports WiFi connection.<br/></p><p>What sort of chipset we will be using? We will be using an FPGA chipset and technology to make this all happen and when it is time for mass production the chipsets will no longer be reprogrammable.  Now the screen is going to be either an LCD or LED screen for brighter and better colors.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Is it going to look like that picture?</h3><p>No way!

Then it asks you to select the kickstart version and it reboots and starts as a classical Amiga that takes advantage of the new hardware configuration (including the new custom chipset and CHIP RAM).  6) It have expansion port that allows you to use real keyboard, mouse, allows for composites, s-video, dvi-i, and hdmi port to hook to your TV. It supports all TV signals including: PAL/NTSC/SECAM, etc. The expansion also supports USB which allows you to use external HD, CD-ROM. 7) Audio filter on/off and power LED on/off based on audio filter is supported (like classical Amiga). 8) It have a 68060 running at 233 Mhz as the base CPU for classical Amiga mode and the kickstart of this console is build as hardware in it. The build in kickstart allows you to boot from HD USB, or CD-ROM which gives you the the advantage to switch to classical mode, and have a new customized Amiga system that takes advantage of the new hardware configuration.  9) Allows you to play movies, mp3, browse the net, watch youtube, etc. Which means it supports WiFi connection.What sort of chipset we will be using? We will be using an FPGA chipset and technology to make this all happen and when it is time for mass production the chipsets will no longer be reprogrammable.  Now the screen is going to be either an LCD or LED screen for brighter and better colors.Is it going to look like that picture?No way! Rest assure that the picture above is just a rough sketch to give you an idea what this project is about. It is going to look better than this for sure and with your help and support will be a very beautiful looking portable console.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>nonda is a smart hardware startup based in Palo Alto, California. We wanted ZUS to be useful to the everyday commuter, traveler, parent, student, and professional. We rethought the way people used a conventional product like a car charger and made it smarter. We build ZUS to help people save time - time saved from searching for your car and from charging your devices, so that you can spend it on things that you really care about.</p>
<p>We're a group of smart hardware enthusiasts, app developers, go-getters, and industry specialists. We love what we do and hope to share our vision of what the future of smart hardware will look like with the world.</p>

We are confident that we can ship in time, having already made preparations to mass manufacture and we're undergoing first batch. The only risk is if the campaign gets funded beyond our wildest dreams (such as over $1.1M), then we would need to ramp up on manufacturing, which we can do quickly since we have staff working onsite with our manufacturer.</p>

<p><b>1. How does ZUS work to find my car?</b></p>
<p>When you turn off your car's engine, ZUS will communicate automatically to your smartphone via Bluetooth to save your car's location using the phone's built-in GPS. When you're heading back towards your car, just open the ZUS app and follow the red arrow, which shows you both the direction and distance of where your car is located. The app will indicate ""Here"" when you're within sight of your car.</p>
<p><b>2. What kind of phone works with the ZUS app? </b></p>
<p>Any smartphone device with iOS 7.1 or newer or Android 4.3 or newer.</p>
<p><b>3. What languages does the ZUS app support?</b></p>
<p>At this time, the app is currently in English and available for download worldwide. </p>
<p><b>4.</b> <b>Can ZUS pair with more than one phone at the same time? </b></p>
<p>ZUS can only pair with one phone at a time. You can however disconnect ZUS from your phone to allow someone else to connect to ZUS.</p>
<p><b>5. Does ZUS work if there's no power when the car's engine has been turned off?</b></p>
<p>ZUS' car locator feature only requires that ZUS is plugged into the socket when you park your car. It doesn't matter if there is power or not after ignition is off.</p>
<p><b>6. How accurate is ZUS' ability to tell where my car is?</b></p>
<p>ZUS relies on your phone's location tracking as approximated by using the following information from your phone: GPS, WiFi, cell tower, accelerometer, compass, gyroscope and barometer.  As a result, the accuracy level can vary between phones and where you are at the point of parking such as being indoors or outdoors can influence the accuracy. While it would be amazing to achieve an accuracy level of plus or minus  1 foot, in actual scenario, ZUS gives you an approximation to get you from somewhere far to within sight of your car or to where you can hear your car beep. </p>
<p><b>7. How can I get additional ZUS units? </b></p>
<p>You can buy more of a specific package. For example, if you want to get four ZUS units, you can pledge for two of the couple packages, bringing your total to $120 + shipping depending on where you're located.</p>
<p><b>8. Will ZUS drain my car's battery if it is left plugged in and if I don't drive my car for a long time? </b></p>
<p>If ZUS' lights are off after you've turned off the ignition, there will be no battery drain problem. If ZUS' lights are on after the ignition is off, especially when the light is still on after 2 hours or during the whole night, and you're not going to drive the car for more than 3 weeks, we recommend that you unplug ZUS from the socket. </p>
<p><b>9. How can I upgrade or change my perk level? </b></p>
<p>Please follow these instructions from Indiegogo: </p>
<p><a href=""https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/526756-How-to-Upgrade-Your-Perk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/526756-How-to-Upgrade-Your-Perk</a></p>
<p><b>10. Does the ZUS app work for a multi-level parking lot, such as an airport parking lot? </b></p>
<p>As long as the airport parking lot is uncovered and you remember which floor your car is on, the ZUS app can help you find your car. Because the ZUS app locates your car via your phone's built-in GPS, the ZUS app only works for uncovered parking lots and it can only tell horizontal distance and not vertical distance.</p>
<p><b>11. How well does ZUS charge NEXUS 6, MOTO X Pure, and Samsung Note 5? </b></p>
<p>Check out the lab testing results here: <a href=""http://www.nonda.co/blogs/news/54743041-lab-testing-result-for-nexus-6-moto-x-pure-samsung-notes-5"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.nonda.co/blogs/news/54743041-lab-testing-result-for-nexus-6-moto-x-pure-samsung-notes-5</a></p>
<p><b>12. How will you ship out my package?</b></p>
<p>During our live campaign For those located in the USA and Canada, we will be using Amazon fulfillment. For those located elsewhere, we will ship via a third party shipping company.</p>
<p><b>13. When will you start shipping?</b> </p>
<p>By mid-November for orders made during the live Indiegogo campaign. For orders made on and between November 12 and December 12, your orders will be shipped out via a third party shipping company by December 14th if it hasn't already been shipped out. </p>
<p>For orders made on and after December 13, orders will be shipped out within 10-12 days via a third party shipping company. You will be emailed a tracking code upon shipping. Please make sure that your shipping address and email is CORRECT. We will not be able to responsibility for an incorrectly entered shipping address.</p>
<p><b>15. When will I get my free 24K gold ZUS?</b></p>
<p>We will ship out everyone's ZUS orders first. Then, we will ship out the 24K gold ZUS as a separate shipment in late December, most likely after Christmas. Manufacturing of the gold ZUS takes more customization work, so hence the later shipping date.</p>

ZUS vs. ANKER's $30 premium charger. ZUS outperforms ANKER (a No. 1 charging brand) by continuing to work under temperatures of up to 145°C.

nonda is a smart hardware startup based in Palo Alto, California. We wanted ZUS to be useful to the everyday commuter, traveler, parent, student, and professional. We rethought the way people used a conventional product like a car charger and made it smarter. We build ZUS to help people save time - time saved from searching for your car and from charging your devices, so that you can spend it on things that you really care about.
We're a group of smart hardware enthusiasts, app developers, go-getters, and industry specialists. We love what we do and hope to share our vision of what the future of smart hardware will look like with the world.


 
 We've done the work in ensuring a quality product. We've gone through several production batches to test for hardware quality and rounds of testing to test for best app user experience. In September, we invited 300 external beta testers through our a-Fans program in order to test for issues and resolve them. Now, after months of work, we're ready to share ZUS with you. We are confident that we can ship in time, having already made preparations to mass manufacture and we're undergoing first batch. The only risk is if the campaign gets funded beyond our wildest dreams (such as over $1.1M), then we would need to ramp up on manufacturing, which we can do quickly since we have staff working onsite with our manufacturer.
 

1. How does ZUS work to find my car?
When you turn off your car's engine, ZUS will communicate automatically to your smartphone via Bluetooth to save your car's location using the phone's built-in GPS. When you're heading back towards your car, just open the ZUS app and follow the red arrow, which shows you both the direction and distance of where your car is located. The app will indicate ""Here"" when you're within sight of your car.
2. What kind of phone works with the ZUS app? 
Any smartphone device with iOS 7.1 or newer or Android 4.3 or newer.
3. What languages does the ZUS app support?
At this time, the app is currently in English and available for download worldwide. 
4. Can ZUS pair with more than one phone at the same time? 
ZUS can only pair with one phone at a time. You can however disconnect ZUS from your phone to allow someone else to connect to ZUS.
5. Does ZUS work if there's no power when the car's engine has been turned off?
ZUS' car locator feature only requires that ZUS is plugged into the socket when you park your car. It doesn't matter if there is power or not after ignition is off.
6. How accurate is ZUS' ability to tell where my car is?
ZUS relies on your phone's location tracking as approximated by using the following information from your phone: GPS, WiFi, cell tower, accelerometer, compass, gyroscope and barometer.  As a result, the accuracy level can vary between phones and where you are at the point of parking such as being indoors or outdoors can influence the accuracy. While it would be amazing to achieve an accuracy level of plus or minus  1 foot, in actual scenario, ZUS gives you an approximation to get you from somewhere far to within sight of your car or to where you can hear your car beep. 
7. How can I get additional ZUS units? 
You can buy more of a specific package. For example, if you want to get four ZUS units, you can pledge for two of the couple packages, bringing your total to $120 + shipping depending on where you're located.
8. Will ZUS drain my car's battery if it is left plugged in and if I don't drive my car for a long time? 
If ZUS' lights are off after you've turned off the ignition, there will be no battery drain problem. If ZUS' lights are on after the ignition is off, especially when the light is still on after 2 hours or during the whole night, and you're not going to drive the car for more than 3 weeks, we recommend that you unplug ZUS from the socket. 
9. How can I upgrade or change my perk level? 
Please follow these instructions from Indiegogo: 
https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/526756-How-to-Upgrade-Your-Perk
10. Does the ZUS app work for a multi-level parking lot, such as an airport parking lot? 
As long as the airport parking lot is uncovered and you remember which floor your car is on, the ZUS app can help you find your car. Because the ZUS app locates your car via your phone's built-in GPS, the ZUS app only works for uncovered parking lots and it can only tell horizontal distance and not vertical distance.
11. How well does ZUS charge NEXUS 6, MOTO X Pure, and Samsung Note 5? 
Check out the lab testing results here: http://www.nonda.co/blogs/news/54743041-lab-testing-result-for-nexus-6-moto-x-pure-samsung-notes-5
12. How will you ship out my package?
During our live campaign For those located in the USA and Canada, we will be using Amazon fulfillment. For those located elsewhere, we will ship via a third party shipping company.
13. When will you start shipping? 
By mid-November for orders made during the live Indiegogo campaign. For orders made on and between November 12 and December 12, your orders will be shipped out via a third party shipping company by December 14th if it hasn't already been shipped out. 
For orders made on and after December 13, orders will be shipped out within 10-12 days via a third party shipping company. You will be emailed a tracking code upon shipping. Please make sure that your shipping address and email is CORRECT. We will not be able to responsibility for an incorrectly entered shipping address.
15. When will I get my free 24K gold ZUS?
We will ship out everyone's ZUS orders first. Then, we will ship out the 24K gold ZUS as a separate shipment in late December, most likely after Christmas. Manufacturing of the gold ZUS takes more customization work, so hence the later shipping date.",35.0,1,"4 Campaigns

<p>Our small company, LaserTechPros LLC, was started by us three high-school graduates when we were seniors in the beginning of 2014. We had a vision of a small self-sustaining company that we could do something we love doing and make some money on the side. So far we are doing pretty well! After using our school's laser machine, we set off and bought our own smaller version to get us started. We have been making payments using the money we earn from online sales, and we are always trying to come up with new products and new ways to help people out! </p>

<p>Sight Saver was designed with the purpose to protect your expensive optics during gameplay. Whether you play indoors or outdoors, there is nothing worse than getting the glass shot out on your red-dot scope and having to pay anywhere from 60 to 200 dollars to replace it! Instead, Sight Saver is a crystal clear shield that can take many hits from Airsoft guns that shoot 400fps and higher! With extra lenses included in our packages, you will never be left hanging with a broken sight!  Sight Saver is like insurance for your hobby investments. It keeps your sight safe and you on the field doing what you love! </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>

We have been making payments using the money we earn from online sales, and we are always trying to come up with new products and new ways to help people out! 
We now present our newest product idea: SIGHT SAVER! 


Sight Saver was designed with the purpose to protect your expensive optics during gameplay. Whether you play indoors or outdoors, there is nothing worse than getting the glass shot out on your red-dot scope and having to pay anywhere from 60 to 200 dollars to replace it! Instead, Sight Saver is a crystal clear shield that can take many hits from Airsoft guns that shoot 400fps and higher! With extra lenses included in our packages, you will never be left hanging with a broken sight!  Sight Saver is like insurance for your hobby investments. It keeps your sight safe and you on the field doing what you love!    What We Need & What You Get 

When you pledge your hard-earned money to our project, we don't take it lightly. We are here to give you the best possible product and service we can to help you and us for the good of everyone! 
Buying Sight Saver does three main things to help us and our campaign.
1. The money that you pledge will be used to have the first production run of the CNC aluminum base mounts to be made. We need a minimum of 50 items for them to be machined. Having low quantity, material, and machining time done by the local shop makes that first order a big investment. Reaching our funding goal will mean we don't have to use any of our out-of-pocket money to make this project happen.
2. The money that you pledge will also be used for the material cost and our lasers working time to cut out the shock resistant lenses for Sight Saver. 
3. Most importantly, you will not only be helping a small product campaign, but you will being giving your support to a genuine small business that is owned and operated by recent high-school graduates with a dream.

<p>Motes are a family of small, wireless sensors for your iPhone, iPad, Android, Linux or Raspberry Pi device that measure environmentals such as ambient temperature, humidity, light, soil moisture, soil temperature, object temperature, human presence and movement. They last for about a year on a single battery and don't require an Internet connection to work. </p>
<p>You can upload your data to our cloud service for analysis via our free app, or use the optional mote.cloud bridge to do it for you in realtime via Wifi.</p>

<p>Instead of launching a weather app, wouldn't it be nice to know what the weather right outside your home is right now? Or if it's too dry or cold at night in your baby's bedroom? Or how long it take my fridge to cool down every time the door is opened? Or if my cigars turning to dust in my humidor? Or if that bottle of vintage wine is turning to vinegar in the basement? Or if my compost heap has finished its aerobic reaction?...</p>
<p>The Climote has literally hundreds of uses where you need precision temperature, humidity and light information. Like all motes, it records this information to its built-in memory when you're not around and can send you alerts when a minimum or maximum threshold is exceeded. You can even upload your mote's data to our cloud service to analyze it or export it to your own applications.<br/><br/></p>

</h3>
<p>The Growmote measures the amount of water available in the soil surrounding the roots of a plant. the level of light available for growing, and even soil temperature to protect against frost. Unlike other devices on the market, they're economical enough to have several of and can 'push' alerts such as ""I need water"" directly to your smart device.</p>
<p>Imagine coming home from work, and your lawn telling you that it needs to be watered?<br/><br/><br/><img alt=""Thermote"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.wimoto.com/images/Thermote.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Thermote""/><img alt=""Pool"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://plantnj.com/assets/img/swimming-pool-landscaping-pictures/landscaping,-entertainment-and-swimming-pools-finest/swimming-pool-night-lighting.jpg"" src="""" style=""font-size: 1.17em;"" title=""Pool""/></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">The Thermote doesn't measure the air temperature or even use a probe: it measures the temperature of an object just by being pointed at it! The techno-jargon for this is ""infrared emissivitiy"". In practical terms, it means that the mote:thermo doesn't need to be touching the object you want to measure the temperature of -- just point and measure!</span></p>
<p>This makes it great for measuring the temperature of the water in your hot tub or swimming pool or aquarium, your body tempature (via your temporal area), food, or anything else you might not want to stick a traditional temperature probe into for reasons of hygiene, comfort or practicality. </p>
<p>Because it's tiny and can easily be stuck to an iPad or iPhone, you can even turn your iPad or iPhone into a portable contactless thermomter!</p>

<p>The Securimote has a passive infrared motoion sensor that detects human movement up to around 5m/16ft away. It also has an onboard acceleromter, so it can detect if it's moved. Use it to notify you if someone is approaching your front door, if your toddler has climbed out of his bed again in the middle of the night, or that the mail is delivered -- the possibilites are enedless!<br/><br/></p>

<p>Our app features a minimalist deisgn and works with the whole range of Motes -- no need to launch separate apps for each type. Simple ""sparkline"" graphing is available on your iPhone and iPad to indicate trends and data can easily be uplaoded to the cloud service for more detailed graphing and data export with the click of an icon.</p>
<p>Signal strength and battery life for each Mote is displayed whilst that Mote is selected.</p>
<p>We will have an Android version of the app for Android 4.3 devices in June or July of 2013, although this is dependant on Google releasing Anrdoid 4.3 with a fully supported version of the Broadcom Bluetooth 4.0 stack. Only devices that have the necessary hardware (most Samsung devices, Google Nexus, etc.) will be compatible -- please ask if you're unsure if your device will be supported.</p>

<h2><span style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">How We'll Use The Money Raised and the Risks and Challenges</span></h2>
<p>We've spent a long time developing our technology, going through various prototypes, developing the iOS app, putting together the beta of our cloud service, and more. We're almost at the pre-production stage, but we need your help to make the first production run a reality.</p>
<p><img alt=""Mote prototype PCB"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.wimoto.com/images/indiegogo/Mote%20prototype%20assembly.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Mote prototype PCB""/></p>
<p>We'll use the funds raised for the following major tasks:</p>
<h3>Plastic Enclosure Moulding</h3>
<p>Even a seemingly simple plastic part can actually have a very expensive and complicated mould. These moulds sometimes cost tens of thousands and sometimes even hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>Rather than have a custom enclosure for each Mote, we've opted to use one basic design that can be post-machined using a CNC. This saves time, money and reduces risk -- it's a lot easier to adjust machining a hole on a generic design than having to redesign the entire mould if the hole is completely wrong. </p>
<p>We've worked with Protomold, a company that specializes in prototpye and short run injection moulding, to design an enclosure that is both functional and economical. Using CAD models they have identified potential issues with our designs *before* manufacturing and therefore we are confident we have mitigated any expensive issues before starting production.</p>
<h3>Regulatory Testing</h3>
<p>Because Motes are both tiny computers and wirelessly communicate with a smartphone, tablet or computer, they require regulatory testing and approval.</p>
<p>To ensure that we get Bluetooth complance approval we've worked with the manufacturer of the Bluetooth SMART system-on-a-chip we're using to ensure we follow their best pratices. We've also reused their reference design for the complicated radio portion, which also means we're assured compliance approval from the Bluetooth oversight body -- Bluetooth SIG. </p>
<p>We have partnered with a testing facility that will perform our FCC (USA), Industry Canada (Canada) and CE (Europe) radio frequency emissions testing and provide consulting advice in the unlikely event we are not compliant. </p>

Motes are a family of small, wireless sensors for your iPhone, iPad, Android, Linux or Raspberry Pi device that measure environmentals such as ambient temperature, humidity, light, soil moisture, soil temperature, object temperature, human presence and movement. They last for about a year on a single battery and don't require an Internet connection to work. 
You can upload your data to our cloud service for analysis via our free app, or use the optional mote.cloud bridge to do it for you in realtime via Wifi.

 
 



Instead of launching a weather app, wouldn't it be nice to know what the weather right outside your home is right now? Or if it's too dry or cold at night in your baby's bedroom? Or how long it take my fridge to cool down every time the door is opened? Or if my cigars turning to dust in my humidor? Or if that bottle of vintage wine is turning to vinegar in the basement? Or if my compost heap has finished its aerobic reaction?...
The Climote has literally hundreds of uses where you need precision temperature, humidity and light information. Like all motes, it records this information to its built-in memory when you're not around and can send you alerts when a minimum or maximum threshold is exceeded. You can even upload your mote's data to our cloud service to analyze it or export it to your own applications.

 

The Growmote measures the amount of water available in the soil surrounding the roots of a plant. the level of light available for growing, and even soil temperature to protect against frost. Unlike other devices on the market, they're economical enough to have several of and can 'push' alerts such as ""I need water"" directly to your smart device.
Imagine coming home from work, and your lawn telling you that it needs to be watered?
The Thermote doesn't measure the air temperature or even use a probe: it measures the temperature of an object just by being pointed at it! The techno-jargon for this is ""infrared emissivitiy"". In practical terms, it means that the mote:thermo doesn't need to be touching the object you want to measure the temperature of -- just point and measure!
This makes it great for measuring the temperature of the water in your hot tub or swimming pool or aquarium, your body tempature (via your temporal area), food, or anything else you might not want to stick a traditional temperature probe into for reasons of hygiene, comfort or practicality. 
Because it's tiny and can easily be stuck to an iPad or iPhone, you can even turn your iPad or iPhone into a portable contactless thermomter!
 
As we've now exceeded our original funding goal, we're able to introduce the...

The Securimote has a passive infrared motoion sensor that detects human movement up to around 5m/16ft away. It also has an onboard acceleromter, so it can detect if it's moved. Use it to notify you if someone is approaching your front door, if your toddler has climbed out of his bed again in the middle of the night, or that the mail is delivered -- the possibilites are enedless!
A Great Looking App
 
Our app features a minimalist deisgn and works with the whole range of Motes -- no need to launch separate apps for each type. Simple ""sparkline"" graphing is available on your iPhone and iPad to indicate trends and data can easily be uplaoded to the cloud service for more detailed graphing and data export with the click of an icon.
Signal strength and battery life for each Mote is displayed whilst that Mote is selected.
We will have an Android version of the app for Android 4.3 devices in June or July of 2013, although this is dependant on Google releasing Anrdoid 4.3 with a fully supported version of the Broadcom Bluetooth 4.0 stack. Only devices that have the necessary hardware (most Samsung devices, Google Nexus, etc.) will be compatible -- please ask if you're unsure if your device will be supported.

Common Features Of All Motes


Technical Specifications

How We'll Use The Money Raised and the Risks and Challenges
We've spent a long time developing our technology, going through various prototypes, developing the iOS app, putting together the beta of our cloud service, and more. We're almost at the pre-production stage, but we need your help to make the first production run a reality.

We'll use the funds raised for the following major tasks:
Plastic Enclosure Moulding
Even a seemingly simple plastic part can actually have a very expensive and complicated mould. These moulds sometimes cost tens of thousands and sometimes even hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Rather than have a custom enclosure for each Mote, we've opted to use one basic design that can be post-machined using a CNC. This saves time, money and reduces risk -- it's a lot easier to adjust machining a hole on a generic design than having to redesign the entire mould if the hole is completely wrong. 
We've worked with Protomold, a company that specializes in prototpye and short run injection moulding, to design an enclosure that is both functional and economical. Using CAD models they have identified potential issues with our designs *before* manufacturing and therefore we are confident we have mitigated any expensive issues before starting production.
Regulatory Testing
Because Motes are both tiny computers and wirelessly communicate with a smartphone, tablet or computer, they require regulatory testing and approval.
To ensure that we get Bluetooth complance approval we've worked with the manufacturer of the Bluetooth SMART system-on-a-chip we're using to ensure we follow their best pratices. We've also reused their reference design for the complicated radio portion, which also means we're assured compliance approval from the Bluetooth oversight body -- Bluetooth SIG. 
We have partnered with a testing facility that will perform our FCC (USA), Industry Canada (Canada) and CE (Europe) radio frequency emissions testing and provide consulting advice in the unlikely event we are not compliant. 
Electronics Assembly and Fulfillment 
One of the biggest challenges with producing a product is getting every part of it made, put together and ready for shipping.
For electronics our electronics, we have a worked with a contract manufacturer who will take on the procurement of most of the parts, manufacturing of the printed circuit boards, assembly of the printed circuit boards and the testing of the completed electronics sub-assemblies. 
But it's not economically feasible to do the above everytime we get a single order -- we need to order in bulk (1,000 Motes or more) to make it practical.

Where the Technology Meet the Art

 
MY STORY
Dear Indiegogo friends, let me introduce myself.
 

My name is Giuseppe Pezzella and I'm an Electronics Engineer and indipendent Physics Researcher.
 
My real passion is studying FREE ENERGY DEVICE but for this kind of study you must be outside of governamental structures such as the academy, yhe university ecc. It is sad to say but it is true......
 
So the real goal behind this campain is to create an Advanced Research Lab for create new Clean Technology and Save Our Mother Earth.
 
 

Fortunately I have created a useful device that can help me raise found and help people in their job: SMS CONTACT!

 
 
 


 
SMS CONTACT
  DO YOU HAVE A JOB THAT REQUIRES TO SETTING APPOINTMENTS  BUT NOT HAVE MONEY FOR SECRETARY?  DO YOU WANT LAUNCH A PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGN FOR  NEW PRODUCT, NEW SERVICE BUT NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY FOR ADVERTISING?

  
WELL, SMS CONTACT WILL DO IT FOR YOU!!
 OK, but how does it work?
 

Since I think that a picture is worth a thousand words I will show both screenshtot and explanation.
 
STEP1: CREATE A CLIENT DATABASE
Every time a NEW customer arrives, their data is insert in sms contact database. By doing so, in a short time and with minimal effort, you will have a complete customer database.

 
 
STEP2: USE SMS CONTACT
With only 5 steps you have created a new reinder. Now relax....The message will be send at required date.
 
 
 
DASHBOARD
In lower side of main page there is a dashboard with all information you need to have under control:

 
 
SMS ARCHIVE MAINTENANCE
Of course there is a section of program  where you can modify or deldete planning SMS:

 
CLIENT ARCHIVE MAINTENANCE
Here you can modify/delete all information of your client

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
<h3>Q. Will I get my money back if you don't raise enough?</h3>
<p>A. Yes! This is our first time using crowd funding. It seems that some people are uncomfortable giving money to flexible schemes, and prefer that the money can only be used for the specific project. We assure you that your contributions are only going to be used for developing Privit, and <strong>if we don't raise enough money to make the project viable, we'll give you your money back</strong>.</p>
<h3>Q. What platforms are you developing Privit for?</h3>
<p>A. The initial version will be released on iOS (iPhone and iPad) and Android devices. After that, we'll target other platforms, including a desktop application.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">A. Please share the link to this page using IndieGoGo's sharing tools or whatever means you have available! Thank you!</p>
<h3>Q. Why should I trust you and not ""the big guys""?</h3>
<p>A. Our business model is fundamentally different to ""the big guys"". They need your data to sustain their businesses. We want you to keep your data for yourself, and to do that we need to charge a small fee to sustain the application development and service.</p>
<h3>Q. How do I know you're not just stealing our data anyway?</h3>
<p>A. We will provide transparency in the development of our technologies and systems. We will also seek third party verification of the security of the application and publish the results. </p>

Another way …
Why should a company have access to your chats between you and your girlfriend? Or store photos of your holidays and parties that you share privately?
We don’t think sending messages should cost something so valuable as your privacy.
We are creating a tool that allows you to communicate with all of the people you care about and to make sure that those communications are really private.
Privit allows you to use the same great features from other messaging apps, such as starting and keeping track of conversations, sharing your location, and sending pictures and videos. However, all of this is done securely so that your privacy is protected. We, or anyone else who might be out there lurking on the Internet, cannot read any of the messages, because you control the ""keys"" to unlock them.
Who’s behind Privit?
We’re two young (well, we think we’re still young!) entrepreneurs from very different backgrounds. We hope that this compliments the project :-)

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">WHO AM I &amp; WHY I LOVE CALLBACK</h3>My name is Lesa Wilson. I earned my certification in Radio and Television Broadcasting at Coosa Valley Technical College. I have worked as a radio dj, tv host, actor and model my entire career. In 2010 I decided to continue my education at The Creative Circus where I studied Interactive Development. With my newly acquired skills, I learned to manage my own career as a business and that is where the idea for Callback was born. <p>For years, I've been managing my work details using spreadsheets and binders full of paper and tabs. Callback gets rid of my binder. It gets rid of my spreadsheets. It puts all of my details in the palm of my hand. With the touch of a few buttons, I can call up any casting I've been on, what I wore, if I got a callback or booking and a dozen other valuable details. In business, we can only improve what we track. Once I started viewing myself as a business and tracking my details, I saw a huge improvement! I also saw the need for simplicity so I can focus on doing what I'm best at.<br/></p>

Callback is a simplistic, beautifully designed application that provides actors, hosts and models a quick and easy way to log castings, manage booking, track finances, and much much more. 

Career and business management will always be necessary for talent industry workers. Many do not have an adequate system of tracking their day to day work, financials, castings and more. Much of the details are misplaced or forgotten. Talent industry workers will benefit greatly by this simply designed, yet detailed application that will allow them to store their career moves in one place and track their progress.
The app will connect with the user’s calendar and maps to keep the clutter to a minimum and avoid conflicts that arise when multiple sources are being used. Another excellent feature of Callback is reports. Reports are available for financials as well as casting and booking stats.


THE MISSION

 TO EMPOWER TALENT BY PROVIDING A TOOL FOR BUSINESS MANAGEMENT THAT WILL DRIVE CAREER GROWTH. 
With Callback, talent is empowered to take control of their business. The application  gives talent professionals the tools to manage their business with very little fuss. 


HOW WILL THE FUNDS BE USED?
The initial funding goal is $10,000. All funds raised here will go directly to development costs for the application to be brought to life. Your contributions will build a tool that will benefit thousands. Every dollar helps and is greatly appreciated!
The stretch goal is $25,000 with the intention of developing an iPad and web based application. This will provide Callback users additional methods to access their details across devices.

THE REWARDS
This is the best part. For your contribution to Callback's development you can receive 

Your name on the credits of the application.

Personalized Thank You note from me! :)
Download(s) of the application for you and your friends.

OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP
If you can't contribute financially but still want to help make Callback a reality, please share this campaign via social media and spread the word to help the application get funded! 

WHO AM I & WHY I LOVE CALLBACKMy name is Lesa Wilson. I earned my certification in Radio and Television Broadcasting at Coosa Valley Technical College. I have worked as a radio dj, tv host, actor and model my entire career. In 2010 I decided to continue my education at The Creative Circus where I studied Interactive Development. With my newly acquired skills, I learned to manage my own career as a business and that is where the idea for Callback was born. For years, I've been managing my work details using spreadsheets and binders full of paper and tabs. Callback gets rid of my binder. It gets rid of my spreadsheets. It puts all of my details in the palm of my hand. With the touch of a few buttons, I can call up any casting I've been on, what I wore, if I got a callback or booking and a dozen other valuable details. In business, we can only improve what we track. Once I started viewing myself as a business and tracking my details, I saw a huge improvement! I also saw the need for simplicity so I can focus on doing what I'm best at.

viel sicherer als herkömmliche Kopfhörer beim Radfahren, Laufen und Autofahren

Info from original campaign:







Cynaps Mint is a small, but extremely powerful, bone conduction headset. In fact, it's the most powerful one on the planet.It's made of modular parts, which can be easily disassembled and reassembled to suit a specific purpose. Wear it as a headset, or separate it from the band and clip it into any hat, helmet or hardhat in seconds!

Tweak it so it fits just right for you. The audio modules, called 'transducers', generate sound through vibration, and you can attach them in different ways to suit many different wearing styles:


You can place the transducers anywhere on your head to hear super clear audio through vibration, via Bluetooth from your phone, tablet, PC and many smartwatches.  
Listen to music or take calls without needing to block your ears. Very useful and much safer than traditional earphones when biking, running and driving, as well as many other sports and outdoor activities like motorcycling or snowboarding. Stay connected, while staying in touch with the world around you.Wouldn't it be easier, since we're already going to be doing all of this snowboarding and motorcycling with a helmet, to have an integrated helmet and headset in one? With Cynaps Mint, it's a snap. The headset disconnects in seconds, and you can use the clips to mount the transducers and base unit directly into any hat, helmet or hardhat!




Are we getting all 'Transformers' on you yet?  :)  Keep reading - it gets better!
Cynaps Mint isn't just a headset.  It's also the world's first and only true stereo vibration speaker system, turning any surface into a set of stereo loudspeakers!  
Our transducers are so powerful, they'll be able to fill a room (or house party) with your playlist and also add a special flavor to your music, depending on which surface you use. 
Stick them on two large glass windows to turn them into a crystal clear, 'stereophonic sound spectacular'.
 Spread them out on a large wooden desk or dinner table to get a very full, rich stereo sound for dinner or background music.  Use them on a car, truck, boat or BBQ grill to get a strong, reverberating sound that everyone can enjoy, letting the music (and the party) take on a life of its own.  


Have fun, and explore your environment - through your music.  Take Cynaps Mint with you, and satisfy the curiosity of your friends with a demo, anytime, anywhere.

 GERMAN VERSION / DEUTSCHE VERSION
Leicht, kraftvoll und macht süchtig.
Verwandelt einen Helm in ein Headset – oder ein Fenster in einen Lautsprecher! 






Cynaps Mint ist ein kleiner, aber sehr leistungstarker Kopfhörer, der den Schall direkt an den Schädel überträgt.  Er besteht aus 3D-gedruckten, modularen Teilen, die je nach Verwendung leicht auseinandergenommen und wieder zusammengesetzt werden können.Cynaps
Mint, hier in „Mint“-Grün und Gelb, das im Dunkeln leuchtet 


Trage es genau so, wie es dir passt. Die Audiomodule, auch „Umwandler“ genannt,
erzeugen Klang durch Vibration. Du kannst sie auf ganz verschiedene Arten
anbringen, genau so, wie du sie am liebsten tragen möchtest. 

Du kannst sie auf die klassische Weise tragen:







oder die beigefügten Clips verwenden, um die Kabel am
Hinterkopf zu führen:
Damen können
es auch als diskreten und komfortablen Haarreif tragen:
Du kannst
die Umwandler überall auf deinem Kopf tragen und genießt durch die Vibrationen
einen superklaren Klang. Über Bluetooth kannst du die Umwandler mit Handy,
Tablet, PC und vielen Smartwatches verbinden.  Du kannst Musik hören oder
telefonieren, ohne dass du deine Ohren bedecken musst. Äußerst praktisch und
viel sicherer als herkömmliche Kopfhörer beim Radfahren, Laufen und Autofahren
und bei zahlreichen weiteren Sport- und Freizeitaktivitäten, wie Motorradfahren
oder Snowboarden. Du kannst den Sound des Cynaps Mint genießen und hast
gleichzeitig immer ein offenes Ohr für deine Umgebung.
Und weil wir gerade vom Snowboarden und
Motorradfahren sprechen – wäre es nicht toll, in den Helm integrierte Kopfhörer
zu haben? Ja, wäre es! Das Headset kann in Sekundenschnelle auseinandergenommen
werden und mit den mitgelieferten Clips kannst du die Umwandler und die
Basiseinheit direkt an einer Mütze oder einem Helm anbringen!




Klingt ein wenig nach „Transformers“, oder?  :)
 Lies weiter - es wird noch besser!
Cynaps Mint ist viel mehr als nur ein Headset.  Es ist
auch das weltweit allererste Lautsprechersystem mit echten Stereo-Vibrationen,
das jede beliebige Oberfläche in einen Stereo-Lautsprecher
verwandelt!  
Unsere Umwandler sind so leistungsstark, dass sie jeden
Raum (und jede Hausparty) mit deiner Playlist beschallen können und je nach der
Oberfläche, die du verwendest, geben sie deiner Musik einen ganz besonderen
Klang. 
Stecke sie auf zwei große Glasfenster und du bekommst
spektakulären und wortwörtlich „glasklaren“ Stereosound.

Platziere sie auf einen großen Holztisch oder
Esstisch und du bekommst einen sehr vollen, satten Stereosound, perfekt für
Abendessen oder als Hintergrundmusik.  Verwende sie an einem Auto, LKW, Boot oder
Grill, und du erhältst einen kräftigen Sound mit Nachhall, den alle genießen
können und der die Musik (und die Party) so richtig in Schwung bringt. 


Du hast Spaß und kannst deine Umgebung
erkunden – mit deiner Musik.  Du kannst Cynaps Mint immer bei dir haben
und es deinen neugierigen Freunden demonstrieren– überall und jederzeit :).

<p><b><i>Ban.gl enables you to store a virtually unlimited amount of information, useful to you and or others exactly when it's needed.  That information is then retrievable with the tap or scan of a smartphone.</i></b></p>
<p>Ban.gl was originally conceived as a way to enable first responder to ascertain quickly who an individual is and what, if any, their special requirements might be.</p>
<p>A typical use-case was imagined primarily as ‘wandering toddlers’ at shopping centres and or elderly relatives like my own Grandfather who suffered from Alzheimer’s and had previously gone on an extended walkabout.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/992226/files/20141106150005-NFC-Emergency-Info-Card.PNG?1415314805"" src="""" style=""width: 260px; height: 440px; margin-right: 10px; float: left;""/></p>
<p>After two years of development and testing Ban.gl is now much more than that.</p>
<p>
        Without needing batteries Ban.gl can display on any web enabled device a virtually unlimited amount of information.  In the case of an elderly relative it might have next of kin contact information or specific medical information.  In the case of a wandering
        toddler it would just be a contact telephone number.
    </p>
<p>
        We need £50,000 to take Ban.gl to the next level and start getting the word out about our revolutionary new way to provide first-responders and others with your important information
        just when it’s needed most.
    </p>
<p>In an effort to reach our financial goals we have devised a number of perks which we hope will excite you enough to support us.</p>
<p>Although our target is £50,000 if we do not reach that goal we will first manufacture and ship all due perks and then, with any money left over, pursue whatever marketing is available to us in an effort to further '<i>spread the word</i>' so to speak.</p>
<h3>Ban.gl can store virtually any amount of information.</h3>
<p>We believe that Ban.gl brings real peace of mind to anybody who worries about the safety of loved ones when they are out and about on their own.</p>
<p><b>With the international recognition a successful Indiegogo campaign can bring, largely, if not exclusively, as a direct result of your participation, Ban.gl will be changing lives and maybe even saving lives on a global scale by March 2015.</b></p>

<h2>It’s a website on your wrist.</h2>
<h3>Some other things you can do with a Ban.gl</h3>
<p>There are myriad other uses and we are hearing and thinking of new ways the Ban.gl can be useful on a daily basis. My teenage kids use their Ban.gl to swap their numerous social media identities with friends and compete with each other as to who’s been ‘tapped’ the most.</p>
<p><i>Sponsor Me – ‘Put your tap where your mouth is’ - Lost and Found - Emergency Medical Information - Waiter/Waitressing Tip Point - Social Networking Card - Digital Business Card - File Download - Important Files such as Passport, plane tickets, visa - Portable Photo Album - Advertising Coupon Keeper - Digital Organ Donor Card - Personal or Business Promotional Device - Safety/Next of Kin when scuba diving - Safety/Next of Kin surfing - Safety/Next of Kin running alone - Safety/Next of Kin when parachuting - Safety/Next of Kin when swimming the channel - Safety/Next of Kin when Sailing - Safety/Next of Kin when Driving - Things to Do List - Remote Whiteboard - Last Will &amp; Testament - Private Treatment Record - Tap Game - Push Device – i.e. others can ‘push’ things on to the Ban.gl remotely</i></p>
<h3>Does it work on all smartphones</h3>
<p>Yes and then some.  There are two or three ways to interact with a Ban.gl.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>First, and the simplest, is to use an NFC enabled smartphone.  With an NFC smartphone you can just ‘tap’ the Ban.gl and the Ban.gl contents will be displayed on the smartphone.  </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>The second way is to scan the QR code on the front of the Ban.gl and then either enter the unique 7 digit alpha numeric code of the Ban.gl or the Nickname the Ban.gl owner has assigned the Ban.gl.  </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>The third way is to point any web enabled device to </span><a href=""https://ban.gl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style='letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>https://ban.gl</a><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'> and enter the 7 digit alphanumeric in to the web form.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Backstory</h3>
<p>
        Initially the idea came about after thinking of my own Grandfather who suffered with dementia.  One day Granddad went ‘walkabout’ for nearly a day without a trace. Thankfully he was eventually found, a little sun-burnt but alive and for the most part, well.  
        Remembering this I thought that if there had been a more visible ‘contact card’ so to speak, a bus driver or other member of the public could have intervened and Granddad may have been found sooner.
    </p>
<p>
        We are all perfectly able to spot when an elderly person is in distress or a little confused but I for one would be reluctant to root through an adult’s pockets in search of I.D.  It's just not very dignified for them. I thought that tapping their wrist would be far less invasive.
         The idea for a durable, highly visible identity bracelet was born.
    </p>
<h3>How does it work – what makes it so fandangled</h3>
<p>Ban.gl, pronounced Bangle, is a silicone bracelet designed to be worn on the wrist. It has an embedded Near Field Communication (NFC) chip and a visible Quick Response (QR) code printed on the face.</p>
<p>Ban.gl is wearable tech that uses an embedded NFC chip that is uniquely coded to a web address.  Each one is different.</p>
<p>Ban.gl stores a unique ID both on the NFC chip and engraved on either the front or reverse of the Ban.gl.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/992290/files/20141106152856-nfc-ban-gl-hot-pink-61mm.png?1415316536"" src="""" style=""width: 321px; height: 321px; margin-left: 10px; float: right;""/></p>
<p>One can interact with Ban.gl by tapping with an NFC enabled smartphone or by scanning the QR code and entering the unique ID or Ban.gl nickname.</p>
<p>The smartphone is then directed to a web based information page which can contain virtually any type of information that has been added by the owner or somebody on behalf of the wearer.</p>
<p>The content accessible via the Ban.gl is virtually unlimited and can include text, video, pictures, forms, buttons or any other 'gadget' that is available on a web page today.</p>
<p>Ban.gl does not require batteries.  It is extremely durable being water proof, shock proof, dust proof, cold proof (-70) and heat proof (+220).</p>
<h3>Where is the project now</h3>
<p>
        Ban.gl has been designed, tested, prototyped, tested and prototyped and tested some more over the last two years.  In July we ordered a minimum quantity of each of the 7 final Ban.gl designs to test the manufacturing process.  We learnt a lot and we now understand where we need to be extra vigilant with regard to the manufacturing process.
    </p><p>The back-end software system has been tested as has the online store and everything else in between from packing and fulfilment through to credit control.<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/994432/files/20141107094523-ban.gl-template.PNG?1415382323"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Feedback so far has been phenomenally positive and we truly believe that Ban.gl can give a little extra peace of mind to anyone with a vulnerable dependant or even to themselves.</span></p><p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/994445/files/20141107094926-iobac-endorsement.png?1415382566"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p><i>Ban.gl is not designed to be a panacea or cure all for any emergency or social situation.  It is a tool.  Much like a box of matches on a cold night; get them wet and they’re useless.  No internet connection at hand, ban.gl won’t tell you much.  However that fact does not stop matches being a useful invention and neither does no internet prevent ban.gl from being useful.</i></p>
<h4>Flexible Funding... hmmm, what happens to my support money if you don't reach your goal?</h4>
<p>Simple, you get what we promised you in return for the level of support you offered.  We already have the manufacturing expertise to produce the Ban.gl.  Our Crowdfunding campaign is to raise cash in order to raise awareness and to acheive economies of scale.  We want to get the RRP of Ban.gl to £10 including shipping.  To do so we have to order in bulk.  By pledging you are effectively, pre-ordering and giving us that purchasing power with our manufacturers.  Additionally the publicity we will be able to buy with a succesful campaign combined with the free publicity we hope to get while running the campaign will help us reach our ends.</p>
<h4>Does the Ban.gl require an Internet connection?</h4>
<p>Yes, sort of.  Ban.gl doesn’t need an Internet connection itself but any device wishing to read the data from the Ban.gl does.  However, every Ban.gl has a telephone number encoded which in the event of no Internet can be called and by stating the Ban.gl ID the information can be accessed.</p>
<h4>Is Near Field Communication aka NFC available on my phone?</h4>
<p>A lot of smartphones nowadays have NFC capability built in.  Windows, Blackberry and a lot of Android phones.  Surprisingly (or not) Apple iPhone, iPad and iPod do not have NFC built in prior to the version 6 model.  However, NFC is ‘restricted’ in the 6 model and currently only operates with Apple’s payment platform.  As of writing there is no announcement from Apple that they will join the rest of the smartphone community and open up NFC for the phones owner to decide what to do with it.</p>
<p>A lot of smartphones NFC is turned off by default.  We’d encourage anybody buying any new technology to thoroughly investigate all of the devices’ features.  Otherwise what really is the point of having them?  Check your device has NFC and if it does turn it on.  It is quite fun.</p>
<h4>If I don’t have NFC on my phone and I wish to interact with a Ban.gl what do I do?</h4>
<p>The next best thing, if for example you have an iPhone, is to download a Quick Response aka QR, reader from your phones app store.  Go by other users ratings and look for a free reader.  There are plenty to choose from.</p>
<p>Other than that you can get to any web enabled device, i.e. your computer, visit <a href=""https://ban.gl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://ban.gl</a> and manually enter the unique ID.</p>
<h4>How is somebody supposed to even notice the Ban.gl let alone know what to do with it?</h4>
<p>Ban.gl is purposefully bright, some might say, garish in colour.  The QR code ‘screams’ scan me!  If not now then over time more and more it will.</p>
<p>During our extensive testing of over 200 people everyone one of them, some quicker than others admittedly, but all of them nonetheless, realised that one needed to scan the QR code.  QR codes are becoming ever more ubiquitous and more and more people are realising they can interact with something when they see them.</p>
<h4>How will the masses learn to recognise a Ban.gl</h4>
<p>But notoriety is key for Ban.gl and that’s a big part of the reason we have gone down the crowdfunding route.  We believe that the Ban.gl is a great product with myriad uses.  However, our initial dream was how it might improve the lives of sufferers of Dementia and their carers and or loved ones.  We need publicity and that costs money.  If we reach our campaign goal we will use a portion of that money to hire some good PR firm to help get the word out.  Over time we are confident that with enough publicity everybody will know what to do if they are a first responder and they see the brightly coloured wrist band with a QR code printed on the face.</p>
<p>Of course any new technology is a mystery to everybody upon first glance.  Some people ‘get it’ quicker than others but eventually the entire human race know what to do with a ‘thing’.  Our dream is to reach that level of penetration.</p>
<h4>Why would people want to use Ban.gl</h4>
<p>Humankind is a tool using species.  If we can make Ban.gl eminently useful people will want to know how to work it. Think of the Internet, email and texting, 10 years ago my parents would have thought I was speaking in a foreign language.  Now they regularly Skype, email, text and Geo Check In and they are nearly 80.</p>
<p>Ban.gl is also far more preferable to rooting through another’s pockets or belongings looking for ID in a first responder type scenario.</p>
<h4>Isn’t the sharing of contact detail already done to death?</h4>

<p><strong>Ban.gl is an information bracelet not an emergency information bracelet.</strong></p></div>","Ban.gl enables you to store a virtually unlimited amount of information, useful to you and or others exactly when it's needed.  That information is then retrievable with the tap or scan of a smartphone.
Ban.gl was originally conceived as a way to enable first responder to ascertain quickly who an individual is and what, if any, their special requirements might be.
A typical use-case was imagined primarily as ‘wandering toddlers’ at shopping centres and or elderly relatives like my own Grandfather who suffered from Alzheimer’s and had previously gone on an extended walkabout.

After two years of development and testing Ban.gl is now much more than that.

        Without needing batteries Ban.gl can display on any web enabled device a virtually unlimited amount of information.  In the case of an elderly relative it might have next of kin contact information or specific medical information.  In the case of a wandering
        toddler it would just be a contact telephone number.
    

        We need £50,000 to take Ban.gl to the next level and start getting the word out about our revolutionary new way to provide first-responders and others with your important information
        just when it’s needed most.
    
In an effort to reach our financial goals we have devised a number of perks which we hope will excite you enough to support us.
Although our target is £50,000 if we do not reach that goal we will first manufacture and ship all due perks and then, with any money left over, pursue whatever marketing is available to us in an effort to further 'spread the word' so to speak.
Ban.gl can store virtually any amount of information.
We believe that Ban.gl brings real peace of mind to anybody who worries about the safety of loved ones when they are out and about on their own.
With the international recognition a successful Indiegogo campaign can bring, largely, if not exclusively, as a direct result of your participation, Ban.gl will be changing lives and maybe even saving lives on a global scale by March 2015.
Some Quick Facts about Ban.gl


Ban.gl is device agnostic and in fact is not limited only to smartphones. Any device that can navigate the web can go to https://ban.gl, enter the unique Ban.gl ID and retrieve the contents of the Ban.gl


It does not require batteries nor will it ever require batteries.


Ban.gl is water proof, shock proof, heat proof, cold proof and stretchable (to a degree)


It can withstand temperatures from as low as -70 to as high as 300.


It utilises Near Field Communication technology (NFC) and each Ban.gl is unique.


It is not a tracking device!


It is a passive information device.  If it helps you could think of it as a modern day SOS Necklace but it is so much more than that.


The content/information Ban.gl stores can be updated as often as you like.


There is no ongoing cost to owning a Ban.gl


Ban.gl comes with a bunch of ready-made templates for storing and displaying certain types of content which means you don’t have to be a tech whizz kid to set it up for your parents.  However, if you are a bit tasty with the old HTML5, Bootstrap and what not then the Ban.gl is your oyster and you can pretty much customise the information display to your heart’s content.  


Ban.gl is made primarily of Silica, the 2nd most abundant material on Earth and 7th in the Universe!


It’s a website on your wrist.
Some other things you can do with a Ban.gl
There are myriad other uses and we are hearing and thinking of new ways the Ban.gl can be useful on a daily basis. My teenage kids use their Ban.gl to swap their numerous social media identities with friends and compete with each other as to who’s been ‘tapped’ the most.
Sponsor Me – ‘Put your tap where your mouth is’ - Lost and Found - Emergency Medical Information - Waiter/Waitressing Tip Point - Social Networking Card - Digital Business Card - File Download - Important Files such as Passport, plane tickets, visa - Portable Photo Album - Advertising Coupon Keeper - Digital Organ Donor Card - Personal or Business Promotional Device - Safety/Next of Kin when scuba diving - Safety/Next of Kin surfing - Safety/Next of Kin running alone - Safety/Next of Kin when parachuting - Safety/Next of Kin when swimming the channel - Safety/Next of Kin when Sailing - Safety/Next of Kin when Driving - Things to Do List - Remote Whiteboard - Last Will & Testament - Private Treatment Record - Tap Game - Push Device – i.e. others can ‘push’ things on to the Ban.gl remotely
Does it work on all smartphones
Yes and then some.  There are two or three ways to interact with a Ban.gl.  


First, and the simplest, is to use an NFC enabled smartphone.  With an NFC smartphone you can just ‘tap’ the Ban.gl and the Ban.gl contents will be displayed on the smartphone.  


The second way is to scan the QR code on the front of the Ban.gl and then either enter the unique 7 digit alpha numeric code of the Ban.gl or the Nickname the Ban.gl owner has assigned the Ban.gl.  


The third way is to point any web enabled device to https://ban.gl and enter the 7 digit alphanumeric in to the web form.


The Backstory

        Initially the idea came about after thinking of my own Grandfather who suffered with dementia.  One day Granddad went ‘walkabout’ for nearly a day without a trace. Thankfully he was eventually found, a little sun-burnt but alive and for the most part, well.  
        Remembering this I thought that if there had been a more visible ‘contact card’ so to speak, a bus driver or other member of the public could have intervened and Granddad may have been found sooner.
    

        We are all perfectly able to spot when an elderly person is in distress or a little confused but I for one would be reluctant to root through an adult’s pockets in search of I.D.  It's just not very dignified for them. I thought that tapping their wrist would be far less invasive.
         The idea for a durable, highly visible identity bracelet was born.
    
How does it work – what makes it so fandangled
Ban.gl, pronounced Bangle, is a silicone bracelet designed to be worn on the wrist. It has an embedded Near Field Communication (NFC) chip and a visible Quick Response (QR) code printed on the face.
Ban.gl is wearable tech that uses an embedded NFC chip that is uniquely coded to a web address.  Each one is different.
Ban.gl stores a unique ID both on the NFC chip and engraved on either the front or reverse of the Ban.gl.

One can interact with Ban.gl by tapping with an NFC enabled smartphone or by scanning the QR code and entering the unique ID or Ban.gl nickname.
The smartphone is then directed to a web based information page which can contain virtually any type of information that has been added by the owner or somebody on behalf of the wearer.
The content accessible via the Ban.gl is virtually unlimited and can include text, video, pictures, forms, buttons or any other 'gadget' that is available on a web page today.
Ban.gl does not require batteries.  It is extremely durable being water proof, shock proof, dust proof, cold proof (-70) and heat proof (+220).
Where is the project now

        Ban.gl has been designed, tested, prototyped, tested and prototyped and tested some more over the last two years.  In July we ordered a minimum quantity of each of the 7 final Ban.gl designs to test the manufacturing process.  We learnt a lot and we now understand where we need to be extra vigilant with regard to the manufacturing process.
    The back-end software system has been tested as has the online store and everything else in between from packing and fulfilment through to credit control.Feedback so far has been phenomenally positive and we truly believe that Ban.gl can give a little extra peace of mind to anyone with a vulnerable dependant or even to themselves.
We are now ready to bring Ban.gl out from the shadows and promote it on a global scale but we need your help.
To launch properly we need a few things that cost money.  We've thought about this figure for a long time and we put our required amount at £50,000.  If we reach our funding goal this is what we will spend it on: 


Getting tooled up - The engraving is done with a specialist laser machine.  we need one of those to achieve the high quality end product we wish to produce.  If we exceed our goal we will get our own injection moulding machine and bring the entire process on shore to the U.K.


Marketing and promotion – This can cost money but can also be your good will. Please help by following us on Twitter and liking our Facebook page – just to spread the word.


Achieve Economies of Scale – We really want Ban.gl to be as affordable as possible.  With that in mind we want to hit a RRP of £10/$16 not including shipping.  Shipping to U.K. will be included, everywhere else will be at cost or maximum £4.50, whichever is lower.  We can hit that target RRP as long as we buy the raw materials and manufacturing in bulk.


When can you expect your Ban.gl
If our campaign reaches its funding goal then no later than the end of February 2015.  If there are any delays to that schedule then we will be up front with all backers and keep you informed.
Risks and Challenges
The usual things can affect us as much as anybody.  Machinery breakdown and other issues in the supply chain.  However, much like above, we will endeavour to keep all backers informed at all times.  After all, it will be very much your project as much as ours.
Support us without money
Please help us get the word out using the IndieGoGo share tools.  Tell us you’ve done it and we’ll put your name on our backers wall on our website.

Frequently Asked Questions
Ban.gl is not designed to be a panacea or cure all for any emergency or social situation.  It is a tool.  Much like a box of matches on a cold night; get them wet and they’re useless.  No internet connection at hand, ban.gl won’t tell you much.  However that fact does not stop matches being a useful invention and neither does no internet prevent ban.gl from being useful.
Flexible Funding... hmmm, what happens to my support money if you don't reach your goal?
Simple, you get what we promised you in return for the level of support you offered.  We already have the manufacturing expertise to produce the Ban.gl.  Our Crowdfunding campaign is to raise cash in order to raise awareness and to acheive economies of scale.  We want to get the RRP of Ban.gl to £10 including shipping.  To do so we have to order in bulk.  By pledging you are effectively, pre-ordering and giving us that purchasing power with our manufacturers.  Additionally the publicity we will be able to buy with a succesful campaign combined with the free publicity we hope to get while running the campaign will help us reach our ends.
Does the Ban.gl require an Internet connection?
Yes, sort of.  Ban.gl doesn’t need an Internet connection itself but any device wishing to read the data from the Ban.gl does.  However, every Ban.gl has a telephone number encoded which in the event of no Internet can be called and by stating the Ban.gl ID the information can be accessed.
Is Near Field Communication aka NFC available on my phone?
A lot of smartphones nowadays have NFC capability built in.  Windows, Blackberry and a lot of Android phones.  Surprisingly (or not) Apple iPhone, iPad and iPod do not have NFC built in prior to the version 6 model.  However, NFC is ‘restricted’ in the 6 model and currently only operates with Apple’s payment platform.  As of writing there is no announcement from Apple that they will join the rest of the smartphone community and open up NFC for the phones owner to decide what to do with it.
A lot of smartphones NFC is turned off by default.  We’d encourage anybody buying any new technology to thoroughly investigate all of the devices’ features.  Otherwise what really is the point of having them?  Check your device has NFC and if it does turn it on.  It is quite fun.
If I don’t have NFC on my phone and I wish to interact with a Ban.gl what do I do?
The next best thing, if for example you have an iPhone, is to download a Quick Response aka QR, reader from your phones app store.  Go by other users ratings and look for a free reader.  There are plenty to choose from.
Other than that you can get to any web enabled device, i.e. your computer, visit https://ban.gl and manually enter the unique ID.
How is somebody supposed to even notice the Ban.gl let alone know what to do with it?
Ban.gl is purposefully bright, some might say, garish in colour.  The QR code ‘screams’ scan me!  If not now then over time more and more it will.
During our extensive testing of over 200 people everyone one of them, some quicker than others admittedly, but all of them nonetheless, realised that one needed to scan the QR code.  QR codes are becoming ever more ubiquitous and more and more people are realising they can interact with something when they see them.
How will the masses learn to recognise a Ban.gl
But notoriety is key for Ban.gl and that’s a big part of the reason we have gone down the crowdfunding route.  We believe that the Ban.gl is a great product with myriad uses.  However, our initial dream was how it might improve the lives of sufferers of Dementia and their carers and or loved ones.  We need publicity and that costs money.  If we reach our campaign goal we will use a portion of that money to hire some good PR firm to help get the word out.  Over time we are confident that with enough publicity everybody will know what to do if they are a first responder and they see the brightly coloured wrist band with a QR code printed on the face.
Of course any new technology is a mystery to everybody upon first glance.  Some people ‘get it’ quicker than others but eventually the entire human race know what to do with a ‘thing’.  Our dream is to reach that level of penetration.
Why would people want to use Ban.gl
Humankind is a tool using species.  If we can make Ban.gl eminently useful people will want to know how to work it. Think of the Internet, email and texting, 10 years ago my parents would have thought I was speaking in a foreign language.  Now they regularly Skype, email, text and Geo Check In and they are nearly 80.
Ban.gl is also far more preferable to rooting through another’s pockets or belongings looking for ID in a first responder type scenario.
Isn’t the sharing of contact detail already done to death?
Yes but similarly lots of kettles boil water. Lots of web browsers can access the web. Lots of telephones can make calls.  Lots of cars transport you from A to B.  Sharing of contact details with a downloadable digital business card is just an example of the type of thing one can do with a Ban.gl
It is a familiar metaphor to understand.  If we were crowdfunding for a fire device we would give the example that one could warm ones hands.  Of course, fire, like a Ban.gl, can be used for a great many other things as well.
Why can’t contact details be printed on the outside of the Ban.gl thereby not requiring any Internet connection or smartphone?
They could and in fact those types of devices are all readily available.  They are called SOS bracelets, wallets, identity cards and such like.  Ban.gl is not trying to occupy that space.  Ban.gl is a new novel concept using a durable, virtually indestructible material that can be easily updated time and time again without any loss of fidelity.  Emergency use is just one facet of Ban.gl.  It makes no sense to print or emboss the wearer’s number on the outside of the bracelet.
Ban.gl is an information bracelet not an emergency information bracelet.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We heard your earbud problems, and like you, we were tired of getting tangled up.</p>
<p>It bothered us that the industry’s response was not to solve this problem, but to ignore it.

<p>After more than 18 months of intensive research, development and refinement, we're proud to present HearNotes WireFree Earbuds with Kleer Technology –<b> the only earbuds that deliver lossless, uncompressed, high fidelity stereo audio without a single wire to get in your way.</b></p>

</h3>
<p>With proprietary systems, <b>you do not know what is being sent to
whom. </b></p>
<p>Let's look at just one example: wireless cards. All data that goes
from your laptop to the outside world passes through your wireless
card. Can you look into a proprietary wireless card to make sure it's
not sending all that data to its manufacturer? Nope –<b> how it works
is a trade secret.</b></p>
<p>The wireless card – and every other component – of your Librem
11 is designed in accordance with the Librem open philosophy of<b> keeping
you in absolute control of your data.</b> <br/></p><p>And you don't have to take our
word for it – because we use free software drivers in the kernel,
<b>where the source code can be verified</b> so
our claims are open to inspection by the global open source community. You are welcome
to look in the kitchen and see how your food is made.</p>
<p>Your Librem laptop comes pre-loaded with software that is designed
to protect your local data, online usage, and everything in
between. The moment you turn on your Librem, you will be as protected
as cryptographically possible.</p>
<p>The Librem 11 represents another concrete step toward<b>
fundamentally changing the computer industry</b>. We believe in
protecting your rights, and will continue to fight on behalf of those
rights.</p><p><b>You are in control of your data and your device.</b> Nobody else.<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463519486/librem11_5-640px_h1nowt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</h3><p>When the average computer company sits down at the negotiation
table, their priorities are<b> price first,</b> then quality, warranty,
availability -- and then price again. </p>
<p>We are not the average computer company, <b>We negotiate first for
users’ rights, </b>then quality, then price.</p>
<p>Since 2014, we
have been sitting at the negotiating table with suppliers from all
over the computer industry, arguing for technology that protects your
rights. 
</p>
<p><b>We want you at the negotiating table with us. 
</b></p>
<p><b>We are here to create a revolution in the computer industry</b> –
you can help us do that by becoming part of the Purism family now!
The more backers we have, the stronger position we are in when we
go to suppliers to fight for your rights!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463519517/librem11_6-640px_ahgrty.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

<p>Your Librem is bundled with PureOS 3.0 -- a ""fork"" of <b>Debian 
GNU/Linux</b> main, with added emphasis on privacy protection, we've also preinstalled the best privacy-protecting 
software applications. PureOS is fully 
free/libre and open source -- meaning you don't have to trust us that it 
respects and protects you, it is verifiable by security experts and 
software developers around the world. <br/></p>

</h3>
<p>We believe that <b>when you own a laptop, you own it. </b>You will not
have to pay monthly charges or recurring payments to keep your
software up to date.</p>
<p>All the software is included for free when you
purchase any Librem product. There are <b>no hidden agendas or “gotchas”
</b>like with some other companies out there.</p>
<p><b>Productivity Software Preinstalled:</b></p>
<p>We have hand
selected what we believe to be the best free software applications to
include with PureOS.  These will allow you the same
functionality as the office and productivity software you are used to -- but without the privacy,
security, and freedom reducing trade offs such as data mining or
relying on insecure cloud computing. <br/></p><p>Librem let you do the things that you like to do -- privately and securely.</p><p>We wrote this copy, designed the Librem 11 3-D animations, edited the photos and edited our campaign video completely with these Free and Open Source apps! <br/></p>

<p>Designing a laptop that meets the standards set by the Purism
philosophy was hard. After a long search, we managed to find
suppliers who would modify or provide a case, daughter cards, memory, drives, battery, camera, and screen that respected your rights to privacy and control of your data.</p>
<p>However, there was no motherboard currently on the market that met
our principles. So we design and manufacture the motherboard ourselves. This is the only way we found to manufacture computer devices in
accordance with the Purism <a href=""https://puri.sm/posts/purism-business-model-and-vision/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">business model and vision</a>.</p>

<h4>&gt;= $550,000 = Released Coreboot for Librems</h4>
<blockquote>Coreboot for all devices; we have been working with volunteer Coreboot developers over the past year, providing hardware to get Coreboot initially developed for the Librem 13, but we need to devote more resources to this cause for all our devices. Having a volunteer effort alone will not suffice, so reaching this stretch goal will allow us to give Coreboot development the resources it deserves.</blockquote>
<h4>&gt;= $750,000 = Freed BlueTooth Driver</h4>
<blockquote>There are no free software drivers for NGFF or minipcie Bluetooth drivers. We must change that to take full advantage of the Bluetooth standard, the protocol, and the devices that use Bluetooth. If we reach this stretch goal we can devote enough resources to free a Bluetooth driver.</blockquote>
<h4>&gt;= $950,000 = Freed Wireless AC Driver</h4>
<blockquote>There are no free software drivers for Wireless AC, and we need to change that. If we reach this stretch goal we will have enough resources to devote to freeing the 802.11ac wireless drivers.</blockquote>
<h4>&gt;= $1,250,000 = Full HTML5 App Store</h4>
<blockquote>Although we want to make all the basic app functions available with free software, some common native apps are proprietary. In these cases, we can replace them with web-based counterparts that run on HTML5. 
We can maximize our impact on the computer industry with a full app store that auto-builds native free software apps. This will allow developers to easily include free apps by default. But we also want to scour the web for popular HTML5 apps to include in our app store. This stretch goal would allow us to devote the resources necessary to create the app store, making using free software easier for the broadest audience, and more functional.</blockquote>

Our Beliefs...
We believe in protecting your digital life. We believe you should not be monitored nor recorded, without your consent. We believe you should not surrender your freedom and your information to corporations for their profit. At Purism, we make products designed to respect your digital rights.



Our Philosophy


Purism will only use free/libre and open source software in the kernel, OS, and all software. 


Purism will design and manufacture hardware that respects users’ rights to privacy, security, and freedom. 


Purism will prioritize privacy, security, and freedom for our users. 


Purism will not discriminate against persons, groups, nor fields of endeavor. 


Purism will source, and manufacture the highest quality hardware. 


Purism will not monitor nor record any user information without explicit consent.


Purism will offer full encryption tools and services for all users without holding the master key.


Purism will donate a portion of proceeds to free software projects on a quarterly basis, according to Purism’s own Free Software for Freedom Margin Share Program.


Minimizing Threats and Eliminating Corporate Control
Surveillance capitalism is on the rise. Controlling your computer and data is big business, Google, Microsoft and Facebook have become billion dollar corporations by harvesting and selling your digital life for their profit. Aren't you tired of having your private life sold to the highest bidder?Many operating systems, and all mobile operating systems forbid anonymous use. The Google Play Store, Apple App Store, and the latest versions of Windows forbid installing apps without registration of personal information. This is not a technical necessity, it is because their business model relies on monitoring your personal data and usage. The Librem will never monitor you without your consent.
Do you want control over when you disclose your personal data?
Do you want a device that will not send your personal information
to corporations and governments?

Do you want a mobile computer that doesn't double as a tracking device?
Do you want to know that when you turn your device off -- it's really off?


If so, you want a Purism Librem. 

Here are some of the threats that are minimized and corporate
control that is eliminated by using a Purism Librem:



Computers Built and Funded By the User, for the User
Purism Librem laptops are funded by the people, for the people, and designed with your comments, feedback, and ideas. We are the first personal computer company that welcomes and encourages your participation. We invite you to participate in our user forums, whether you own a Librem or not.The Librem's free and open source software is community-developed by hundreds of thousands of volunteers all over the world -- with the source code available for all to participate and improve.



What Makes Purism's Librem Better than ""Proprietary"" Computers from Apple, Lenovo, Dell, Google and other vendors?

With proprietary systems, you do not know what is being sent to
whom. 
Let's look at just one example: wireless cards. All data that goes
from your laptop to the outside world passes through your wireless
card. Can you look into a proprietary wireless card to make sure it's
not sending all that data to its manufacturer? Nope – how it works
is a trade secret.
The wireless card – and every other component – of your Librem
11 is designed in accordance with the Librem open philosophy of keeping
you in absolute control of your data. And you don't have to take our
word for it – because we use free software drivers in the kernel,
where the source code can be verified so
our claims are open to inspection by the global open source community. You are welcome
to look in the kitchen and see how your food is made.
Your Librem laptop comes pre-loaded with software that is designed
to protect your local data, online usage, and everything in
between. The moment you turn on your Librem, you will be as protected
as cryptographically possible.
The Librem 11 represents another concrete step toward
fundamentally changing the computer industry. We believe in
protecting your rights, and will continue to fight on behalf of those
rights.You are in control of your data and your device. Nobody else.


Go ahead, open it up. We trust you.
The back unscrews so you can upgrade it yourself. Nothing is glued down and it's neatly organized. 



How Can We Do This, When Other Companies Have Not?
When the average computer company sits down at the negotiation
table, their priorities are price first, then quality, warranty,
availability -- and then price again. 
We are not the average computer company, We negotiate first for
users’ rights, then quality, then price.
Since 2014, we
have been sitting at the negotiating table with suppliers from all
over the computer industry, arguing for technology that protects your
rights. 

We want you at the negotiating table with us. 

We are here to create a revolution in the computer industry –
you can help us do that by becoming part of the Purism family now!
The more backers we have, the stronger position we are in when we
go to suppliers to fight for your rights!


PureOS
Your Librem is bundled with PureOS 3.0 -- a ""fork"" of Debian 
GNU/Linux main, with added emphasis on privacy protection, we've also preinstalled the best privacy-protecting 
software applications. PureOS is fully 
free/libre and open source -- meaning you don't have to trust us that it 
respects and protects you, it is verifiable by security experts and 
software developers around the world. 


PureOS Updates and Software Apps are Free -- Forever

We believe that when you own a laptop, you own it. You will not
have to pay monthly charges or recurring payments to keep your
software up to date.
All the software is included for free when you
purchase any Librem product. There are no hidden agendas or “gotchas”
like with some other companies out there.
Productivity Software Preinstalled:
We have hand
selected what we believe to be the best free software applications to
include with PureOS.  These will allow you the same
functionality as the office and productivity software you are used to -- but without the privacy,
security, and freedom reducing trade offs such as data mining or
relying on insecure cloud computing. Librem let you do the things that you like to do -- privately and securely.We wrote this copy, designed the Librem 11 3-D animations, edited the photos and edited our campaign video completely with these Free and Open Source apps! 
WritingSpreadsheetPresentationDrawingPhoto EditingAudio EditingVideo Editing3D Animating

What About Installing a Different OS or Apps?
Librem is your computer, and you can do what you want with it. That being said, we recommend using Operating Systems (OS) that fully respect your rights.


Manufacturing Versus Sourcing
Designing a laptop that meets the standards set by the Purism
philosophy was hard. After a long search, we managed to find
suppliers who would modify or provide a case, daughter cards, memory, drives, battery, camera, and screen that respected your rights to privacy and control of your data.
However, there was no motherboard currently on the market that met
our principles. So we design and manufacture the motherboard ourselves. This is the only way we found to manufacture computer devices in
accordance with the Purism business model and vision.

Hardware Kill Switches
All Librem products offer Hardware Kill Switches that physically sever the circuit at the hardware level for:

Wireless & Bluetooth
Camera & Microphone
The Librem 11 is planning to add hardware kill switches for:


Cellular card slot
GPS

There is an increasing threat of cameras and microphones being used to spy on you. Documents have shown plans to infect 'millions' of computers with malware called CAPTIVATEDAUDIENCE, which turns a computer's microphone into a bug, and GUMFISH, which turns your camera into a spycam. Such attacks will only become more common in the future. We decided to stop these types of attacks entirely: with switches that physically sever the circuit to the microphone and camera. Try hacking that!



All Purism Librem Products:

Librem 10: A 10.1"" 2-in-1 Intel Atom based tablet/notebook

Librem 11: An 11.6"" 2-in-1 Intel Core M based tablet/notebook

Librem 13: A 13.3"" Intel i5 based laptop

When Will I Get My Librem?
The first batch will be ready September 2016. This date allows us to finalize our design, manufacture a small run, then order the components, assemble them, load the software and ship to you.


Shipping Costs
$80 US domestic shipping.
$115 International shipping. Any applicable international customs and duties are not included in the price and are the responsibility of the recipient.


Warranty
Every Librem comes with a two-year warranty, covering parts and labor. We currently have one facility in South San Francisco for repairs. However we are also pursuing distribution and warranty repair within other countries.


Replacement and Upgrade Parts
Once we are shipping from stock in September 2016, we will also offer replacement and upgrade parts for sale.


Future Models
In the future the Purism team will be putting out a phone... stay tuned.


Business Challenges
The biggest challenge we face at Purism is delays in the supply chain. We are getting better at managing these delays, but since we are buying small, but growing, supply runs, we don't yet have enough leverage to make strong demands upon our suppliers.
We can overcome these delays by placing larger orders, stocking items in-house, and making suppliers compete for faster delivery times. Your order today adds an extra bit of weight to our demand.


What Stage of Manufacturing are you at now?
The final prototypes of the Librem 11, and the Librem 10 are completed. With your help we can begin a full-scale production run at our South San Francisco facility.


Plans After Successfully Funding
We have very big plans, we believe in protecting your digital life. We want technology that does just that to become the default for all users. We want average computer users to consider the Librem line an easy alternative to proprietary systems that engage is surveillance capitalism.
Our next product will be a Librem phone! It will have all the same protection benefits of our other products, but in a smaller form factor. You will, for the first time, be able to control your mobile phone.


Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you cannot help by pre-ordering a Librem 11, or by donating to our cause, there are a number of other ways you can help:

Spread the word on your favorite social media
Use free software, which strips power from proprietary software

Sign the ""Remove the Intel Management Engine (ME-less)"" Petition
Volunteer on our team, we have all sorts of things we're trying to do. Drop a line to hr@puri.sm and let us know you're interested.
If you're a developer, join our development team! Get in touch with hr@puri.sm today.



Sales After the Campaign Succeeds
Our crowdfunding goal allows us to place what is known in the business as a Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ) order. Once this order is in, the Librem will go on sale through our website and resellers. Once we are shipping from stock, around September 2016, the turn-around for new orders will be 1 to 2 weeks.


Stretch Goals
>= $550,000 = Released Coreboot for Librems
Coreboot for all devices; we have been working with volunteer Coreboot developers over the past year, providing hardware to get Coreboot initially developed for the Librem 13, but we need to devote more resources to this cause for all our devices. Having a volunteer effort alone will not suffice, so reaching this stretch goal will allow us to give Coreboot development the resources it deserves.
>= $750,000 = Freed BlueTooth Driver
There are no free software drivers for NGFF or minipcie Bluetooth drivers. We must change that to take full advantage of the Bluetooth standard, the protocol, and the devices that use Bluetooth. If we reach this stretch goal we can devote enough resources to free a Bluetooth driver.
>= $950,000 = Freed Wireless AC Driver
There are no free software drivers for Wireless AC, and we need to change that. If we reach this stretch goal we will have enough resources to devote to freeing the 802.11ac wireless drivers.
>= $1,250,000 = Full HTML5 App Store
Although we want to make all the basic app functions available with free software, some common native apps are proprietary. In these cases, we can replace them with web-based counterparts that run on HTML5. 
We can maximize our impact on the computer industry with a full app store that auto-builds native free software apps. This will allow developers to easily include free apps by default. But we also want to scour the web for popular HTML5 apps to include in our app store. This stretch goal would allow us to devote the resources necessary to create the app store, making using free software easier for the broadest audience, and more functional.


Sign Our ""Remove the Intel Management Engine (ME-less)"" Petition
Sign the petition to free Intel CPUs from the Management Engine (ME).

The consumer Management Engine is a binary 'blob' (piece of firmware) required for Intel CPUs. We have been working with our partner Intel to make this blob free for the community to inspect and alter.

Intel has told us they cannot free the ME for existing products, but they are interested in hearing from you, to see if you want to have an ""ME-less"" (Intel's internal name for our request) design in future CPUs. 

Please take a moment to sign our petition to request Intel to create an ME-less CPU.

Your voice will be the difference between having an ME (bad) or not having the ME (good!). We have verified the ME is not required to operate the Librem, but Intel has a watchdog that powers off the CPU if the ME is not present.

François Téchené — Director of Creative

François is a French film maker and animator who dedicates himself to promoting freedom of creativity. He believes that being able to freely access, share, study and improve the essence of anyone’s creativity is essential for our global evolution and harmony. It is not just about software.

    Previously, François mainly used proprietary technologies but has made the move to only use free & open source software and formats for the entire workflow of his visual creations. He believes that free technologies are now mature enough to be used in a professional film production environment.
    He is not going back.

    François comes from a software programming background so he also dedicates some of his time to contributing to free software projects in multimedia creation such as the 2D animation software Pencil2D.

    He is co-founder of the Ethic Cinema foundation that aims to promote free access to film making creativity and techniques.",65.0,0,"1 Campaign

It's no wonder the technology has found its way into the workplace, where professionals use their voice to be efficient at their PC, but blind people and others with disabilities must pay extra for a convenience everyone else takes for granted. DictationBridge plugs right into today's leading screen readers to provide blind and otherwise disabled people using voice recognition an experience as efficient as everyone else enjoys. Please help us close the gap between screen reading and speech recognition technologies.</p><p>Upon its release, DictationBridge will be free software using every definition of the word ""free.""

<p>Hi! I am Sujit. I do all the Software magic stuff.</p>
<p>Contact me: sujit@popins.in</p>
<p><strong>Why are you creating it?</strong></p>
<p>We both are professional embedded developer and big Arduino fan boy. We have very strong experience on prototype designs based on GSM, GPS, Wi-Fi, RF and sensor networks. We understand the term “Internet Of Things"" very seriously.</p>
<p>In one of our project development process we discover unnoticed features of SIM900 GSM modules. SIM900 modules generally make communication with AT commands, but its manufacturer also supports to develop and run custom Embedded API on it, which makes it a different playground to do some more good work. Unfortunately this embedded application is not available for general SIM900 modules, it need custom firmware to load in order to use it additional features.</p>
<p>So we decided to make these useful features accessible to open source community.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you trying to make it affordable?</strong></p>
<p>We did small research and found that there are many GSM Shields available in different parts of world, but neither of them are design to work standalone nor they support any embedded application development. You need always an additional, external microcontroller to use it. In addition they are expensive to use, even official Arduino GSM shield cost over US$100.</p>
<p>But we finally find way to make A Cellular IOT development platform but in affordable cost.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you doing a crowd funding campaign at IndieGoGo?</strong></p>
<p>We want this product to be accessible to Makers, Inventors, Engineers, Educators, Farmers, and Beginners for their creative requirement, but at the same time we want it affordable to them.</p>
<p>So we did the math and it turned out, if we rise at least US$10,000, then we can do a first run for 200 pieces of these boards. That brings the manufacturing cost down and we can make this board affordable to everyone. All fund raised here at IndieGoGo campaign will be used to pay for components resourcing and manufacturing cost.</p>
<p>But this can be only possible with your support and feedback.</p>
<p><strong>How are you manufacturing the circuits for the orders placed?</strong></p>
<p>We have our own Fab-house with manufacturing setups for low to mid volume production. All the boards will be manufacture in-house only. We have good supply chain network, which ensure us the availability of all components according to BOM (Bill of Materials) are in stocks. So we have confident to deliver this product on schedule.</p>
<p><strong>Where the funds go if you don’t reach your entire goal?</strong></p>
<p>If we do not meet the target number, don’t panic. We got our piggy banks and hammer ready to score the number. We will make it successful.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""color: #fff; background-color: #999; padding: 5px;""><strong>Shipping</strong></h3>
<p>As we said before, the goal is make it affordable, which means shipping cost also comes under consideration. The best solution for shipping from our place is <strong>Registered Airmail</strong> from <strong>INDIA POST</strong>. This is affordable &amp; fast enough as the shipment delivers in less than a week to most of the larger Countries. Plus it offers an online tracking system. At the time of shipping you will receive an e-mail with the confirmation and tracking number. You will receive the product in Bubble envelope. As the real value of the product is very low, no Countries should apply customs duties, we will despatch envelope with CN22 custom declaration. The sealed envelope weighted appx. 400grams. Shipping cost is US$8 (including packaging) for worldwide shipping.</p>
<h3>FAQs</h3>
<p><strong>I contributed to a perk but I forgot to add the extra $8 for shipping. How can I increase the amount?</strong></p>
<p>No problem! If you'd like to add funds for shipping, you can make another contribution and select ""No Perk, Just a Contribution.""</p>

What is it?
This is an open source Cellular IOT Development platform with custom firmware fully Arduino compatible, design to work as IOT Device, for IOT Device that Everyone Can Afford.
IOT: Internet Of Things
This affordable platform is packed in SIM900 SoC (System on Chip) Based on ARM926EJ core Runs at 156MHz with Quad band GSM baseband.

On board high sensitive 66-channel GPS with AGPS & DGPS support, uSD card for data logging, USB interface and lots more.

What it is not?
It is not just another DIY cellphone platform. This is definitely not a Mobile phone.
 

Arduino Compatible
As we all know Arduino is Maker’s first choice for any electronics project and we all like to work on Arduino, because it’s simple to program and flexible to interface. We followed the same simplicity and flexibility with our board.
Out of your imagination we have made official Arduino GSM library 100% working on our Board. Our Custom Firmware allows you to take full flexibility from Arduino GSM Library. (Please note Arduino GSM shield use different GSM module, so till now Arduino GSM library only works for Official GSM shield.)


 
Auto Configure, Program over Air, Easy to Customize
IOT device means your projects stay out in field, in farm, in the hands, in car and homes of users, where they belong. So best way to work with it is take away the wires and do whatever configuration on air. Easy to set up and work out of box, easy to customize.
Yes our device allows you One time Auto configuration according to mobile network and it is ready to connect with Internet. Program, configure your software in web environments, also we deliver update firmware to your device over the web. (But still you can program the device by USB or from uSD card).

 
Works both off-net and On-net, Global base band supported
Cellular IOT Board is an open device, not locked to any particular network. It works in all countries that provide GSM/3G/LTE-based network services. Our customised Firmware allows you control your device off-net just by voice call, texting or SMS as well as On-net through GPRS. So if you have our device on Mt Everest, you can connect it.
 
Open source platform and Design to Hack.
This device is totally open source. All our hardware design files and firmware will be available on internet under Creative common licence.
Interfacing details, libraries, schematics and all technical support will be available on our website for following popular development platforms. 

OR

Yes, our device has a very powerful 32-bit ARM processor incore, which has 1MB flash memory, 1MB RAM, 1MB EEROM and additional IO pins for additional embbeded application. Now you can add some more stuffs and an option for On-board high sensitive GPS module, uSD card datalogger.
Even you can configure it to run as stand-alone Web server or configure as client with TCP/UDP protocol. It also supports HTTPS protocol.
We have  also added voltage level shifter for UART pins, so you do not need external level shifter for 3.3V to 5V interfacing. With independent Arduino Extensions you can do hassle free interfacing for both 5V and 3.3V standard breaouts and sensors modules.
Application possibilities are endless if you have the idea and want to make cool things or use it inside your product.


 
Powered with Python
Configure device built-in features IO pins, PWM, ADC, GPS, and Memory etc. with Python script editor. Modify API and store settings in uSD card.

<p>In 2010,<strong> 9.4 million people owned</strong> but over <strong>27 million people enjoyed riding a motorcycle</strong>.  The majority of people in the USA who ride do not own a motorcycle. This group has been relegated to borrowing a friends bike or renting one from time to time.  Jupiter's MotoShare service is for the <strong>17.6 million people in the USA looking for a better way to ride motorcycles</strong>.</p>
<p>Jupiter's was launched by me, Chris Miles in 2009 - born of my passion for riding and frustration with the lack of rental and other services available for motorcycle riders.  In 2013, we will add ""<em>remote access</em>"" - the same technology that allows members to get on a bike anywhere at anytime like Zipcar. By <strong>2014-2015 you will begin to see Jupiter's in other parts of the country </strong>- providing you with great motorcycles to ride with none of the hassles or responsibility of ownership.</p>
<p>When Jupiter's MotoShare accepted our first member, Tom Burke and first fractional owner, Nick Baker the idea of sharing motorcycles through this service was born.  (Thank you both for believing in the idea.)  <strong>Both Tom, who pays a monthly fee and Nick, who shared his motorcycle have gotten to ride a variety of bikes without any of the hassle or responsibility of ownership.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The common problems: Cost, Hassle, Variety and Community.  </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Problem 1) Cost </em>- Why pay for something I only use 7 months a year? Garage parking for just the winter is at least $150 per month. Or my partner doesn't understand <em>why I pay for insurance on something I use once a month</em>.</li>
<li>
<em>Problem 2) Hassle</em> - Taking care of a motorcycle requires knowledge, time and money.  Some of the best drivers of all time had no interest or understanding of mechanics.  For some, scheduling a maintenance, never mind doing an oil change, tires or brake pads yourself is too much. </li>
<li>
<em>Problem 3) Variety</em> - I want to ride different motorcycles.  Not all bikes are the same.  For a long trip I want a comfortable bike but for a day trip give me something fast.  Owning 1 bike is doable but owning 10 is impossible both time and cost wise.  </li>
<li>
<em>Problem 4) Community</em> - Most of my friends do not ride and making friends that do can be a challenge.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since our first members joined, <strong>Jupiter's community of riders has found a solution for these problems - MotoShare.</strong>  By sharing the cost and motorcycles with each other, everybody gets access to more bikes, with no hassle for a lower price. </p>
<p><em>Our community believes this is better option than owning a motorcycle and is committed to making Jupiter's accessible to as many people as possible.</em>  We have our initial commitment to build out our remote access services (similar to that of ZipCar) in NYC for 2013.  But help us make this a huge success and you will have Jupiter's in your city too.</p>

Our community believes this is better option than owning a motorcycle and is committed to making Jupiter's accessible to as many people as possible.  We have our initial commitment to build out our remote access services (similar to that of ZipCar) in NYC for 2013.  But help us make this a huge success and you will have Jupiter's in your city too.
How would you like to ride one of these?
Say hello to the Brammo Empluse - the first 6 speed transmission ELECTRIC Motorcycle. 

Brammo Empulse
 
This handsome bike is the Triumph Tiger 800  - it has an amazing 3 cylinder 800 cc Engine that can do anything.

Or, for the formal events you can take the Moto Guzzi v7 - classic styling with the reliability of today's modern motorcycles.

This is our gift to all of our supporters - Jupiter's T- Shirts comes in Heather Grey, Black and Green.  Sizes from XS - XXL in both Men and Women's.  Shirts are American Apparel Cotton-Poly 50/50 and are super comfortable.

Jupiter's T-Shirt - Men & Women Sizes XS-XXL
Help make Jupiter's the ZipCar for motorcycles by making the commitment to become a member today or by sharing this with others who need this service. The more support for Jupiter's the sooner you will see this in not just NYC but your city.  
For less than the cost of owning 1 motorcycle, Jupiter's can help you have 10's or 100's of different motorcycles ready for you to ride around the country.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Designer isn't just another iPhone cover. It's impact absorbent, functional, and can be completely customized to your style.</h3>
<p></p>
<p>I've been a part of a small company based in Cleveland, Ohio called MobileTogs since the beginning. Basically what happened was a concept for a fashionable, functional phone case spurred a small group of friends to pursue a dream to create it. After several months of getting molds created as well as prototypes, last October we were finally able to put a product on our virtual shelves. <br/><br/>Helping to launch and brand this project has been the most exciting, and sometimes trying thing I've ever done. Our first product, <a href=""http://mobiletogs.myshopify.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Looker</a> iPhone case, which has a scratch-resistant and shatterproof mirror and pocket for essential cards, has made great strides raising awareness for the ""no-name"" brand <i>togs</i> over the past ten months. And as more and more people get their hands on the case, more and more ideas come to the table of, “how can we make this project grow from a single product to an entire line of functional iPhone cases?”  </p>
<p>That’s where the idea for The Designer came in to play. The thought generated from wanting to take our product that everyone already loves and give them and future customers the opportunity to make it even better. We prompted our fashion blogger, Caroline Dengel, to ""create something"" on the mirror of the case. She doodled with nail polish and her fans were LOVING the idea and immediately started asking where they could get her case.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/90866/files/20130923105224-Photo_Jul_23__10_06_01_AM.png?1379958744"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We realize the concept of individuality is so important in today’s society that we couldn't resist finding out how to make our product fit perfectly in our customize-everything world. </span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Sure, we could just sell another product, but with your support, we can make The Designer case 100% customizable!</h3>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/90963/files/20130923112757-Paul_s_Work.png?1379960877"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>To create our prototypes we reached out to two very different artists with two completely different audiences so we could show the diversity of our product. One has a huge gamer following and the other creates much more whimsical sketches with tons of personality. From one end of the spectrum to the other, we love the idea of making a case that truly fits EVERYONE'S persona. </p>
<p>Our funding goal is a modest $5000.00. With this money we will be able to make the necessary changes to our website that will allow people to upload their specific designs for their case. Much like any website out there that allows you to create your own T-Shirts, business cards, etc... we want YOU to have the ability to fully customize your case from the design you choose, to where you want it placed, on any color &amp; sized case you want.</p>
<p>Reaching our goal will also give us the funding to reach out to more artists to create cases for an even bigger audience. Supporting creativity is the main goal behind The Designer case and we hope to spawn a full line of pre-designed mirrors from our collection of artists, as well.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our entire goal, we will press on in creating The Designer case. To put it simply, if we reach our goal, we will both be able to give you the ability to fully customize your case AND give us the ability to support independent artists by purchasing in-house designs. If we do not, we will be forced to make a decision between one or the other - and we really don't want to have to do that!</p>

<p><b>Individuality</b>: Show the world what your about and what organizations you support.

<p><b>Fashion</b>: Are you an avid mirror user and tired of using worthless iPhone ""mirror"" apps that don't work? Worry no more!

<p></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","The Designer isn't just another iPhone cover. It's impact absorbent, functional, and can be completely customized to your style.

I've been a part of a small company based in Cleveland, Ohio called MobileTogs since the beginning. Basically what happened was a concept for a fashionable, functional phone case spurred a small group of friends to pursue a dream to create it. After several months of getting molds created as well as prototypes, last October we were finally able to put a product on our virtual shelves. Helping to launch and brand this project has been the most exciting, and sometimes trying thing I've ever done. Our first product, The Looker iPhone case, which has a scratch-resistant and shatterproof mirror and pocket for essential cards, has made great strides raising awareness for the ""no-name"" brand togs over the past ten months. And as more and more people get their hands on the case, more and more ideas come to the table of, “how can we make this project grow from a single product to an entire line of functional iPhone cases?”  
That’s where the idea for The Designer came in to play. The thought generated from wanting to take our product that everyone already loves and give them and future customers the opportunity to make it even better. We prompted our fashion blogger, Caroline Dengel, to ""create something"" on the mirror of the case. She doodled with nail polish and her fans were LOVING the idea and immediately started asking where they could get her case.



We realize the concept of individuality is so important in today’s society that we couldn't resist finding out how to make our product fit perfectly in our customize-everything world. 



Sure, we could just sell another product, but with your support, we can make The Designer case 100% customizable!



To create our prototypes we reached out to two very different artists with two completely different audiences so we could show the diversity of our product. One has a huge gamer following and the other creates much more whimsical sketches with tons of personality. From one end of the spectrum to the other, we love the idea of making a case that truly fits EVERYONE'S persona. 
Our funding goal is a modest $5000.00. With this money we will be able to make the necessary changes to our website that will allow people to upload their specific designs for their case. Much like any website out there that allows you to create your own T-Shirts, business cards, etc... we want YOU to have the ability to fully customize your case from the design you choose, to where you want it placed, on any color & sized case you want.
Reaching our goal will also give us the funding to reach out to more artists to create cases for an even bigger audience. Supporting creativity is the main goal behind The Designer case and we hope to spawn a full line of pre-designed mirrors from our collection of artists, as well.
If we do not reach our entire goal, we will press on in creating The Designer case. To put it simply, if we reach our goal, we will both be able to give you the ability to fully customize your case AND give us the ability to support independent artists by purchasing in-house designs. If we do not, we will be forced to make a decision between one or the other - and we really don't want to have to do that!


Function, Individuality, Fashion
Function: The Designer is made of impact absorbent material that is smooth and comfortable to touch. It slides easily in and out of pockets for quick access to items like your ID, Credit Card, or Transit card that you have stored in the pocket feature of the case.
Individuality: Show the world what your about and what organizations you support. Either choose custom designed artwork from some of our talented independent artists, OR if we haven't come up with something you're into, with your backing we will be able to give you the option to upload your own graphic, logo, or picture of your favorite furkid for a fully customized look.
Fashion: Are you an avid mirror user and tired of using worthless iPhone ""mirror"" apps that don't work? Worry no more! The printed area of The Designer is a scratch resistant, shatterproof mirror. And if you're not into the whole mirror-thing, you can get your design printed on the back side... and still have an easy-access mirror on-hand to use when no one is looking!

<span style=""background-color: initial;"">The CamCam Story...</span><br/>
</div> <p>Over the past several years we have seen social media blow up with everyone sharing their photos of the fun times, their loved ones, and their passions.  Over the past year or so we have seen those photos change to videos and even now to LIVE broadcasting.  What hasn't changed?  The devices we use to casually capture these moments without lugging around your camera or reaching for your smart phone. How many great moments have you missed because by the time you opened your smartphone and found the camera App, the moment was already gone?  We wanted a way to always be stylishly wearing a camera so that when the moment comes, we can capture it instantly and hands free.  And now with the CamCam you can.  Whether taking photos, recording video, and even LIVE broadcasting through the CamCam App, you'll capture every moment, every time, Hands Free!</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>

<p></p>
<p>From Hunting to Fishing, to Baseball and Golf, the CamCam has you covered.  At your kid's sporting events or school recitals, remain hands free and still capture every moment every time with the touch of a button!  Vacations to the beach or site seeing in Paris, LIVE broadcast those moments to your family and friends so all your loved ones can experience the moment with you!</p>
<p></p>
<p>With the CamCam we no longer have to strap cameras to our head or glasses, or haul them around in an extra bag or on a stick.  We will simply and stylishly already have them on us to capture those spontaneous moments every time hands-free. We can even customize your CamCam with your company logo or colors and we will soon have all your favorite professional and college team caps and visors to sport at game time!</p>
<p>Sharing photos and video has been the hottest technology trend over the past few years and now LIVE broadcasting is becoming ever so popular.  But why?  Because we care to share what we do, who we love, why we live, where we've been, and what each and every one of us are passionate about.  Now let's do it Fashionably, Casually, and Hands-Free with your CAMCAM!  So please support us in any way you can, every contribution will get us closer to our goal!   Thank you and we'll be in touch with you soon.</p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FKzDO2gmU5lA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKzDO2gmU5lA&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FKzDO2gmU5lA%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>

<h3>Mu One: Development Timeline</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Upon completion of the initial Kickstarter campaign, first production orders have been placed and tooling has commenced. We will be placing our second production order upon completion of this Indiegogo campaign. Thereafter, production testing and external certification testing will be undertaken to ensure that the Mu One behaves exactly as we expect.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong><i>But why did we decide to launch on Kickstarter first and then InDemand on Indiegogo?</i></strong><br/>Well, we want to give as many people as possible the opportunity to get their hands on the 'all new' Mu One, and Indiegogo to us has a wider overseas audience which we have not captured from Kickstarter so far.</p>
<p>We are a small team, and after these Crowd Funding campaigns have completed their Worldwide shipping for the Mu One, it will then be limited to just shipping and retail in the UK for now, as well as Amazon UK, US &amp; Europe. We are hoping to expand our shipping reach soon, and hope to progress with this to put the Mu One on the global stage.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A few years ago two Dudes wrestled with a sketch.</p>
<p>A sketch that was about to have life forced upon it.</p>
<p>It was the start of a heroic British start-up story. A story that was solving a long overlooked problem of the size of the humble UK plug.</p>
</div>
<div>
<div data-id=""19218653""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521479062/cerrrdvtjlewk2o7si9c.png"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Having been unchanged for over 50 years the UK plug was outdated and outsized in comparison to the mobile devices that it served. That changed as the sketch became the Mu and the UK plug size was solved forever.</p>
<p>The Mu won Design of the Year, Accessory of Mobile World Congress along with other associated high profile awards for its novel and simplistic form factor.</p>
<p>But in reality, the job was only half done.</p>
<p>Under the hood, the unseen secondary challenge of the Mu related to the power that it provides. In its first manifestation the ‘Mu Classic’, the Mu had an output power of 1Amp — just enough to charge a smartphone. Later, the ‘Mu Tablet’, ‘Mu Duo’ and ‘Mu International’ increased the power to 2.4Amp — now smartphone and tablet ready. But the enemy of increasing the power of the Mu had two faces: the size of the components on the electronics board inside the Mu that were generally linear to its output, and the heat that it produced. The Mu, being super small, had a very limited enclosure to fit power and to disperse and heat. The impact that the Mu could have over a full range of mobile devices was limited by its essence — size.</p>
<p>For the last two years, the small team behind the Mu have been working with the major global semi-conductor companies aligning their design to the ultimate pursuit of these goliath power providers — high power density (lots of output in a small space) and high efficiency (low heat loss).</p>
<p>And the results are in…</p>
<p>The Mu One hosts 45W output power, now enough to power the latest notebooks and Macbooks. It hosts Power Delivery Technology that creates a variable voltage for fast charging devices, and it has an auto detect chip on board that creates an optimum charge for iOS, Android and other makes of mobile devices. All of this inside the svelte 14mm profile of the Mu.</p>
<p>Being able to add over four times the power of its predecessor is a result of the birth of Gallium Nitride Technology (GaN) enabling a huge amount of power to be enclosed in a very small space — all whilst running at a market leading efficiency of over 90%.</p>
<p>Finally, the solution to create the ultimate Mu is available.</p>
<p>Technology has finally caught up with the Mu that those two Dudes always wanted to produce.<br/> </p>

<h2> </h2>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Our small design team first successfully launched our UK version of the Mu in 2012.</p>
<p>Since then we've established fantastic manufacturing partnerships allowing us to design and build a Mu family.</p>
<p>This will be our third big product release since launching the original Mu USB charger in 2012, and this time around we have been working with a specialist technology partner to deliver an extraordinary small and powerful product. The Mu One combines their expertise, our design skills and the superb production capabilities of our manufacturing partners.</p>
<p>All of these are in place and prototypes have been made so we just need to lock down those prototypes, push into production, create some tooling and stir in a little magic.</p>
<p>Saying that, we've done this before and we know that nothing is plain sailing but we've built in some contingency time into our production schedule to allow for the inevitable 'item' that we can't foresee at the moment. We're confident that the pursuit of creating magic will overcome that unknown 'item'. And we've been here long enough to know that we'll be handling both during and after this campaign.</p>
<p>Now, it's magic time!</p></figcaption></figure></div>

Being able to add over four times the power of its predecessor is a result of the birth of Gallium Nitride Technology (GaN) enabling a huge amount of power to be enclosed in a very small space — all whilst running at a market leading efficiency of over 90%.
Finally, the solution to create the ultimate Mu is available.
Technology has finally caught up with the Mu that those two Dudes always wanted to produce.

Risks and challenges
 
Our small design team first successfully launched our UK version of the Mu in 2012.
Since then we've established fantastic manufacturing partnerships allowing us to design and build a Mu family.
This will be our third big product release since launching the original Mu USB charger in 2012, and this time around we have been working with a specialist technology partner to deliver an extraordinary small and powerful product. The Mu One combines their expertise, our design skills and the superb production capabilities of our manufacturing partners.
All of these are in place and prototypes have been made so we just need to lock down those prototypes, push into production, create some tooling and stir in a little magic.
Saying that, we've done this before and we know that nothing is plain sailing but we've built in some contingency time into our production schedule to allow for the inevitable 'item' that we can't foresee at the moment. We're confident that the pursuit of creating magic will overcome that unknown 'item'. And we've been here long enough to know that we'll be handling both during and after this campaign.
Now, it's magic time!",23.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Our App is 70% complete and we just need $3,000 more to finish and launch it.<br/>
</h3>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>So where do I start.... Background? My name is Blake Gratton and I have an identical twin brother named Brock Gratton who is my best friend and business partner.  Together our story is pretty long so I'm going to give you the short version in hopes that I do not completely bore you.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Brock and I graduated college in 2004 and immediately started working for a large bank doing mortgages.  It was the absolute prime time to get into the mortgage business and we were knee deep in loan applications ranging from experienced investors to first time home buyers.  We quickly realized that 90% of our customers were first time home buyers and had absolutely no clue what to expect.  They didn't have a clue as to what they wanted, how much they could afford, what their mortgage payment would be, or even what interest rates looked like.  So this created a very tough relationship up front trying to hold the clients hands and make sure they understood why they couldn't afford a beach front property.  Lol<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Working with first time home buyers was fun, but we quickly realized our clients needed to be better prepared and needed to understand the mortgage loan process. This is why we've come up with an app that will do all of this for them. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The app is also geared towards mortgage loan officers who do not want to carry their laptop around with them everywhere they go.  The application will have a section that allows mortgage loan officers to fill out full 1003 applications, save them to their app, email them to themselves and more. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">What the App will do:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Mortgage Calculator </span>- You will be able to plug in how much the purchase price is for a home, how much money you can put down, and what interest rate you will have.  It will then calculate how much taxes, insurance, and your monthly payment.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Live Interest Rates</span> - We will have an interest rate feed that will update throughout the day as to what the daily interest rates are.  It will show 30 year fixed, 15 year fixed, 1 year arm, treasury bond, and more.</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">A Full Mortgage Application</span> - Yes... a full mortgage application.  The app will have a 1003 (Mortgage terms) that you will be able to fill out and email to yourself.</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Save &amp; E-mail Feature:</span> The app will allow you to fill out an application, save it and come back to make as many changes to it as you would like.  If you find a new house at a different price?  No worries... open up the old app and make the appropriate changes.  Then e-mail it to yourself and present it tot he loan officer.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Amortization Schedule</span>- Everyone wants to know how much they will be paying towards interest and how much they will be paying towards principle.  This will spell it all out for you.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Our website has been thrown up, we just need to complete it and get it ready for when we launch the app.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This application will help the mortgage world 10 folds.  It will not only save you time and give you complete knowledge as to what to expect, but it will make you a more qualified home owner.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The application was originally set up to target Mortgage Loan Officers who could take a mortgage app whenever and wherever they were as long as they had their iphone or ipad.  But during development and really thinking about who can benefit from this app, we decided the target market was not restricted to loan officers, but to actual home buyers as well.  If every customer I worked with walked into my office with a fully filled out loan application, and knowledge as to how much they could afford, I would have had more happy customers and closed loans.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So we've been working on this app on and off for quite a long time now.  We've designed the look of the app, and even have the app integrated into the apple testing framework, but we have not yet built out the functionality.  We've run out of funds for the app and need to raise $3,000 just to finish the functionality.  Once it's fully functional we will go ""live"" with it and start selling it in the app world.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Forward this campaign to anyone in the mortgage business or anyone looking to buy a new home.  The minute we raise enough money we will pay the programmer to finish it and launch.  We're really excited about this project and are happy to have found Indiegogo.com</p>

In the recent years, Apple has been intentionally reducing and changing the ports on its products, while making us buy over-priced adapters. We have an iPhone and an iPad, but we felt frustrated, because we faced the following problems:
We couldn't easily connect our old speakers, keyboards, projectors, etc.
Everything needed a separate adapter, but we could plug in only one cable
When connecting a cable, we lost the advantage of mobility
We couldn't attach a flash drive or an external hard drive to our iOS devices
We couldn't share, edit and backup files with others offline

<h3>About us</h3>
<p>We are young and ambitious. We have a good idea and want it to become a reality. For the last year we have been creating Deeper - smart sonar, operating with smartphones and tablets that support Android 2.2+ and iOS 4.0+ operating systems. It is a unique project that requires large investments. This is why we can not bring it to completion unless we get your financial assistance. We ask you to support us and we will do everything to make this product reach you, your friends, relatives and other passionate fishermen as soon as possible. We hope that Deeper will serve both, the passionate amateur fishermen as well as the professionals. We want you to be the one with the biggest catch!</p>

<h3>What is Deeper?</h3>
<p>After a few futile hours at the pond with a fishing-rod many begin to wonder what it would be like using one’s smartphone to see where all the fish are hiding. With this device we are making it possible. The sonar ensures that your fishing goes successfully in any fresh or salt water all around the globe. When Deeper is paired with your smart device, its unique technology allows you to see the view of the ponds bed. It is reflected by sonar's emitted waves then the information is sent to the screen of a phone or a tablet allowing you to learn about the water temperature, depth and, of course, where the fish are.</p>

<div>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>Deeper interacts with a smartphone or tablet computer via Bluetooth connection and a special mobile application created for this unique sonar. Using this app, you will see all the information required to enjoy successful fishing.</p>
<p>Deeper sonar can easily interact with a smart device within up to 150-foot range with no additional cables. Operating systems Android 2.2+ or iOS 4.0 and higher will ensure that the mobile app works right.</p>

<p>Mobile app of the Deeper sonar lets you observe air temperature, moon phase, turn on the calendar and check the dates important to fishermen without turning off the echo-sounder. You can instantly take a photo of the fish you just caught without turning off the application and post it on Facebook or Twitter social networks. You don't even need to leave the boat or the fishing site.</p>

<p></p>
<p><br/>Cousins Tammy and Kim Fuller were so impacted by the May 20, 2013 tornado that hit Moore Oklahoma.<span>  They were doubly devastated when another F5 tornado hit neighboring community El Reno on May 31.</span></p>
<p>Tammy and Kim had always wanted to work together to do some disaster preparedness efforts, but not till the May Oklahoma tornadoes did it hit them how they could help.</p>
<p>Software architect Tammy and public relations and disaster prevention expert Kim heard that media reports that some Oklahoma residents didn’t immediately take cover after a tornado warning was issued because they feared nobody would be able to find them in the rubble.</p>
<p>Immediately Tammy and Kim came up with the concept of developing a smartphone app that allowed users to alert family and friends that they have taken cover during a tornado warning, the location of their safe place and the exact GPS location of that location should street signs and landmarks be destroyed.</p>
<p><br/>Once the app was developed Tammy was able monitor via web-based mapping software by GeoRss compatible systems, they realized that local first responders can see every person who has activated their app, their current location, saving valuable time knowing where the people are, not just searching every home not knowing if a person took shelter there or not.</p>
<p><b>SEEKING AT LEAST $5000 for LARGER SERVER</b></p>
<p>The developers, Tammy and Kim are seeking at least $5000 to secure a larger server to enable larger numbers of users to partake in the app. Currently the cost of the app will have to be approximately $2.99 per user because of the charges that the developers are going to have to incur to allow the app to email; text and make a phone call with the users current location.<span>  </span></p>
<p><span>If  servers are donated or $5000 is raised to incur that cost, the cost of the app could be reduced or funds could be used to develop the follow on products (Find Me-<br/>Hurricane Safety app; Find Me—Winter Snow Storm Safety app; and Find Me –<br/>Spring Storm Safety app).</span></p>
<p>Contributors will receive each of the apps free of charge and also receive free disaster safety information during emergencies in their own areas.<span> <br/></span></p>
<p><span>Contributors will also have the satisfaction that we have the capacity to enable thousands of users in tornado alley to take cover with the peace of mind that someone knows where to come find them once a tornado has passed.</span></p>
<p><b>THE IMPACT</b></p>
<p>Helping Tammy and Kim developed this app and follow on products will give you the satisfaction that we are the first group to develop a real-time tornado rescue app in the country. We believe this will be the wave of emergency management and first responders. In fact, we see this being a feature in existing safe rooms. Right now there is no standardized feature notifying communities where there are safe rooms (storm shelters) and if people took shelter in them. This technology can eventually be adapted for actual tornado safe rooms and shelters.</p>
<p><b>OTHER WAYS TO HELP</b></p>
<p><br/>Tammy and Kim could use your help: </p>
<ul>
<li>Please get the word out to family and friends in tornado alley (by the way every state in the country has had tornados) to purchase the Find Me—Tornado Safety App) and anyone in the news media help us get on your shows or in your publication to talk about this groundbreaking safety app.  App will be available September 11, 2013 (pending iTunes approval)<br/> </li>

The invisible back button lets your iPhone go back easily. With this little magic, you can operate your phone with one single hand.  Why you need it? iPhone is becoming bigger and better. Maybe too big to hold with a single hand? You may drop your phone when press the faraway button on the top. Double tap and swipe can help in somehow. However, you may not succeed every time when swipe while double tap takes a long time.                   
Before: cannot reach the back button on upper left corner
 After: go back easily with the invisible button 
  
How to use a HALO BACK?
It's really simple. Just install the smart screen protector on your phone, turn on the screen, WOW, the magic button works!
No battery. No APPs.
  
What's improved in the new generation?

iPhone 7 type added! 
2 times the sensitivityof 1st gen, thanks to the new electric circuit design based on nanomaterial generates. 
3 options of basic materials which are first class of screen protector.

On the back side (not visible) is a micro SD card reader. No external memory device is needed to boot the TX1. It boots from the internal 16GB eMMC.<p></p>
<p>Currently the J120 printed circuit board (38198) is in PCB making. Please have a look at the blog in the end. Then we will build up prototypes. First samples for beta customers will be available in late March/early April. We will test these and correct any bugs, if there are any. With our experience with the J100 we expect the rev 1 of the J120 to be very clean. In any case we will clean up the design with rev 2 and produce a bigger quantity. I expect rev 2 to become available in April/May 2016.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Auvidea J100 carrier board for the TX1</span></p>Auvidea has developed the tiny J100 (38188) carrier board, which is targeted mainly at UAV applications. Therefore it has non standard connectors, to reduce weight and size. The rev 1 pictured below has a pin connectors for USB3. Rev 2 (38188-2) will have 2 micro USB 3 connectors (on the left). Optionally it will integrate a 9 axis sensor (IMU).</div>

<div>We have received the first prototype (38188) on Feb 7. In just 5 days, we got all the basic functions to work. It boots into the Ubuntu GUI. We can run complex applications like playing 4k videos on a 1080p60 monitor. We can read and write the SD card. We have console access via the UART. Next we bring up Ethernet by interfacing a motherboard to connect to a standard RJ45 connector.</div>

The board size is exactly the same (50x87mm) as the TX1. The large heatsink on top is optional. The TX1 features extensive power management. If it is not doing much it stays very cool. But if you really load the CPU and GPU the power consumption might raise to 10 to 15 watts. <p></p>

Times will be over where the UAVs just fly into trees or people.</li> <li>please have a look at the auvidea.eu site. Our focus is on products to encode video so HD quality can be streamed live from the UAV to the ground station.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks</h3> <p> The J100 shows that we are on the right track. Auvidea has the knowhow to concept, design and manufacture high integrated systems with todays high speed serial busses like USB3, CSI-2, HDMI, LVDS and more. We understand the design rules to make this technology work. And our team is very dedicated and motivated to bring these systems to life in a very short time. Our in-house manufacturing allows us to build prototypes and the initial production run very quickly with top quality.</p>

</div></div>","Auvidea J120 You are looking for very high CPU and GPU performance computer in a tiny package. The J120 carrier together with the Jetson TX1 compute module packs super computer power in a mini form factor.
The J110 just got better - it became the J120 and now features an integrated 9 axis sensor (IMU) for drone and UAV applications. To reduce risk and improve time to market we have implemented the mini HDMI port of the J100.






This block diagram shows a minimum CAN centric flight controller based on the TX1. The motors are controlled via CAN based ESCs like the ESC32 by Autoquad. Positioning data is provided by the Auvidea CAN2GPS module (38183 - Ublox MAX8W). The USB3 stereo camera may be used for visual navigation and object detection.How do the various models differ?
J100 + 38194: this is the combination of the J100 plugged into the 38194 modular motherboard, which brings out a few extra interfaces.

Quad core ARM + GeForce graphics
Look at the J120 being the integration of a high performance quad core ARM system and a NVIDIA GeForce graphics card. You can even run your CUDA or Visionworks applications on the J120 with TX1.

Just 2 months ago NVIDIA started shipping the Jetson TX1 development board with the TX1 compute module. For the J100 shrinks the development board to the tiniest form factor possible - the size of the TX1 compute module itself. The J110 is just slightly bigger. It is just a little wider to make space for standard connectors. 


mini HDMI port to connect to your monitor
USB2 and USB3 for mouse, keyboard and devices like the ZED stereo camera
Gigabit Ethernet 
Wifi
onboard M.2 type M slot for extremely fast SSDs (up to 2500 Mbyte/s)
size: just 50 x 111 mm (TX1 + 24mm)





NVIDIA Jetson TX1NVIDIA's press release states that ""Jetson TX1 is the first embedded computer designed to process deep neural networks -- computer software that can learn to recognize objects or interpret information."" The 3.4x2 inch (87x50mm) module includes a Tegra X1 ARM Cortex-A57 processor with 256 core NVIDIA Maxwell graphics, 4GB of LPDDR4 memory, 16GB of eMMC storage, 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth and Gigabit Ethernet.




3D image of J120 carrier board



The 3D image shows the 3 connectors for 1000B-T Ethernet, dual USB3 and mini HDMI port on the left. In the middle is the M.2 slot for 2280 (22x80mm) ultra fast SSDs. On the bottom edge are expansion connectors for USB0, fan, UART, 2x CAN and power. On the back side (not visible) is a micro SD card reader. No external memory device is needed to boot the TX1. It boots from the internal 16GB eMMC.
Currently the J120 printed circuit board (38198) is in PCB making. Please have a look at the blog in the end. Then we will build up prototypes. First samples for beta customers will be available in late March/early April. We will test these and correct any bugs, if there are any. With our experience with the J100 we expect the rev 1 of the J120 to be very clean. In any case we will clean up the design with rev 2 and produce a bigger quantity. I expect rev 2 to become available in April/May 2016.
Auvidea J100 carrier board for the TX1Auvidea has developed the tiny J100 (38188) carrier board, which is targeted mainly at UAV applications. Therefore it has non standard connectors, to reduce weight and size. The rev 1 pictured below has a pin connectors for USB3. Rev 2 (38188-2) will have 2 micro USB 3 connectors (on the left). Optionally it will integrate a 9 axis sensor (IMU).

We have received the first prototype (38188) on Feb 7. In just 5 days, we got all the basic functions to work. It boots into the Ubuntu GUI. We can run complex applications like playing 4k videos on a 1080p60 monitor. We can read and write the SD card. We have console access via the UART. Next we bring up Ethernet by interfacing a motherboard to connect to a standard RJ45 connector.


This picture shows how the J100 mounts underneath the TX1. The board size is exactly the same (50x87mm) as the TX1. The large heatsink on top is optional. The TX1 features extensive power management. If it is not doing much it stays very cool. But if you really load the CPU and GPU the power consumption might raise to 10 to 15 watts. 


The J120 design is largely based on the J100. We just increased the size slightly to make space for the standard connectors (RJ45 Ethernet, dual USB3 and mini Displayport). As we now know the little mistakes we have made on the rev 1 J100, we are very confident that the J120 will work straight away. 
Plan
 Please contribute so that we have the funds to finance the build of a pre-production run.   we have a batch of PCBs (printed circuit boards) build we need to source the components required - some have lead times and need to be ordered in quantity first we build a couple of sample in mid March and test them thoroughly 
next we build a batch of cards for the beta customers    
NIVIDIA Jetson TX1
I think NVIDIA has designed a great product with the TX1. It brings high performance desktop performance and features to embedded system. So now we can architect a very powerful and feature rich mini computer.  I think people will then have a platform so they an bring a whole set of new applications and use cases to life our focus is on UAV applications - with the TX1 the UAV has the compute performance so it eventually can see like we do. Times will be over where the UAVs just fly into trees or people. please have a look at the auvidea.eu site. Our focus is on products to encode video so HD quality can be streamed live from the UAV to the ground station.    Risks  The J100 shows that we are on the right track. Auvidea has the knowhow to concept, design and manufacture high integrated systems with todays high speed serial busses like USB3, CSI-2, HDMI, LVDS and more. We understand the design rules to make this technology work. And our team is very dedicated and motivated to bring these systems to life in a very short time. Our in-house manufacturing allows us to build prototypes and the initial production run very quickly with top quality.

This picture shows the production of the bottom side of the J100 module together with 2 other products on the same panels. This fully automatic pick and place system has the precision and speed to place the tiny and fine pitch components on the board.Embedded World show  From Feb 23 to 25 we are showing the J100 at the NVIDIA booth at the Embedded World show in Nuremberg. If you get a chance please come to see us and have a look at our carrier boards for the TX1. 
Please also have a look at the thread below. Here the TX1 and Auvidea's carrier boards for the TX1 are discussed. DIYdrones thread on the TX1 and Auvidea's carrier boards
Where do I get the TX1?
The TX1 development board have been shipping in the US since December 2015. Thousands of kits already have been shipped. The list price is $599. There is a special educational discount: $299. European orders are scheduled to start shipping in March 2016. We are looking it creating a special bundle of the J100 and J120 carrier boards and the TX1. Please stay tuned.
Can I pay in US $?

This project is set up in EUR. But do not worry. If you are based in the U.S. or elsewhere you can easily pay in US $ with your standard Paypal account. Just specify that you would like to pay in EUR. Paypal takes care of the currency conversion for you.

February 12: start of the layout of the J110 carrier board. We started with the J100 and removed all components which are not required. The board was enlarged by 20mm to make room for the connectors. Then all required components are placed to the right and yellow wires indicate how they should connect. There are 325 components in total.


This is the J100 prototype with TX1 module installed in an aluminum case. We will demo this at the Embedded World show next week in Nuremberg.  This setup has the ZED stereo camera connected and it runs the ZED depth finder demo app.


The large PCB shown is the J200, which is designed to carry two TX1 modules for power hungry applications.

February 20:  layout of the J110 finalized. PCB production of the J110 and the J100 rev 2 will start on Monday, Feb 22nd. I expect to receive the finished PCBs on Tuesday, March 8th. Both the J100 and the J110 are 6 layer PCBs. 



If you are interested in the J100 and you would to build a UAV or drone to show at the upcoming NVIDIA GTC please contact me, so that we work out a special plan.

As much as we love Apple devices, we don’t love the fact that all the cables from different devices get tangled, messy, or lost. That’s why we’ve turned to wireless charging. However, most wireless chargers in the market can only charge 1 or 2 devices with low power so it takes forever.  Introduce SliceCharge, the World’s Fastest 3-in-1 Wireless Charger for All Apple Devices -- iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch. Fully charge your iPhone X/8 in less than 3.2 hours. With SliceCharge’s 18W, it is 1.5 times faster than other wireless chargers on the market. The same charging speed as cable, have the same charging efficiency without being restricted by a wire. The SliceCharge is one of the only chargers on the market that can FAST charge up to 3 Apple devices at the same time, at 18W power delivery. With Slice, you can even charge two iPhones at once, at a rate of 20% battery boost in less than 30 minutes. That’s a 70% increase in efficiency.  It doesn’t just stop with iPhones, SliceCharge can fast charge Android phones up to 10W, too! Now you don’t have to fight over the charger with your family and friends. Compared with other wireless chargers, skip the complicated installation process with Slice. We have integrated an Apple Watch coil inside the charging pad as well as 2 Qi compatible. Just simply place your iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods on SliceCharge and it’s ready to go. The SliceCharge is the only charger that is thinner than the phone it charges. Measured at only 6.9mm (0.27 inch), the Slice is smaller than the iPhone X at 7.7mm (0.30 inch). After much design iterations and mold building, we crafted a structure that fits the most powerful charging protocols within the most compact space. Wireless charging has been a relatively new feature for Apple consumers, therefore, only the newest Apple devices have wireless charging capabilities. The AirPods users currently don’t have the luxury of wireless charging, but we’ve designed something to change that.  Our engineers have designed an AirPod Power Case with built-in receivers to enable wireless charging AirPods. Simply place your insert your AirPods into the AirPod Power Case and let them charge wirelessly.  This leather pouch mysteriously contains Qi compatible charging technology built into it. Our phones always seem to die at the worst time. With the SliceCharge, simply place your phone on the fast charging pad and continue doing whatever you were doing -- whether it’s watching cute dog videos or playing an intense game! Place your phone with its case on and watch it charge without a problem.An 18W power adapter is offered for you to select if you haven't an adapter which meets QC3.0 9V/2.5A. It is compatible with both 120v and 240v AC. *Please specify whether you need type A/B or type C/E/F/J/L. If you do not specify will send you Type A/B. *If the power adapter still cannot meet the local standard of your country, we will offer a free power plug for you, once you select the rewards with the 18w power adapter included :) SliceCharge is available in 3 colors! Choose from Carmine Red, Frosted White, and Indigo Blue :)We used the newly designed prototype charging pad to test - see how fast we can fully charge an iPhone with 7.5W.   Creating valuable products has always been our philosophy.

<h3> I am Johnathan Stanley, a business professional and entrepreneur with a background of creating business models and systems specifically geared towards making difficult tasks simple! Heart2Give is a campaign consisting of a team of 8 business professionals who are pursuing a vision greater then ourselves! We want ALL charities to have access to a phone app that allows all of their supporters the power to donate in the moment of need right from their personal smart phones! This is something very important to me because of the great amount of time and energy that must be invested by charities to raise funds to then be able to go serve the need they were passionate for in the first place. If the effort to gain funds and complete administrative necessities could be minimized, how much more effective might they be?!?. We have found no systems like this that are 100% free for the charities to use and most non-profits don’t have the resource to build their own. Something else to think about is the value of gaining the ability to donate when someone is in the “moment”, rather than waiting or putting it off till later. This is going to be a VERY sophisticated phone app and with your help we believe it can literally change the way in which the world gives while increasing the volume of giving exponentially!</h3>
</div>
<p><strong><em>Ok! What we need and what you get!</em></strong></p>
<p>Well to put it simply from an IT Development standpoint this aint your grandmas phone app! The back end data base of the software is very in-depth and secure so the brunt of our budget is for back end code writing and system architecture. We are literally building an entire secure and personalized dashboard for the charities to create custom campaigns, provide transparency of their financial distributions for interested donors, import donor lists, immediately send notifications and requests for individuals to give as a need arises, and track cash flow. The system will also organize every donation made by each donor and provide statements for tax write offs. The $28,000 will also allow us to create the API in multiple platforms including iOS for IPhone as well as Android and tablets.</p>
<p>Oh and yes, the perks for helping us fund this amazing giving app:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 1 donations of $10-$50 are our “Enthusiasts”.  You will, of course, receive a tax write off since we are a 501c3 non-profit but you will also have your name listed on our “Giving Revolution Supporter Page”.</li>
<li>Level 2 donations of $50-$100 are our “Visionary Firebrands”. Tax write off, your name in the “Giving Revolution Supporter Page” plus our cool Heart2Give T-Shirts printed with the H2G logo and “I started a revolution”</li>
<li>Level 3 Donations of $100-$1000 are our “Radical Dynamos”.  You will have all the perks of the first two PLUS we will showcase the charity of your choice on the home page of Heart2Give during our launch for thousands of donors to see!</li>
<li>Level 4 Donations of $1000 + will aptly be our “REVOLUTIONARIES”.  All the benefits of the first three PLUS you will be listed as a founder and VIP treatment in our concert promotion where we will set a Guinness Book of World records for donations raised in a liver performance, real time, through electronic devices.</li>
</ul><p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Other ways you can help!</strong></p>
<p>If you are in a financially tough position and just don’t have money to donate you can still be a part of the Giving Revolution! We are all about helping other Charities and are already putting together lists of Non-Profits who would like to learn more about the giving app on Heart2Give and how it might benefit them! Please pass this Indiegogo fundraser to everyone you know. We are also beginning to showcase different non-profits around the country on our Facebook page so feel free to forward their info to us and you never know we might do an interview.</p>

<h3>Live App Design - powered by Silicon W</h3>
<p>Live App is a platform designed and devloped by Silicon W. Silicon W is a tech-art fusion space that teaches design and development to young entrepreneurial talent while building community projects for mutual benefit. We hope to inspire tech-art innovation that creates jobs and creative tech solutions to the world wide challenges we face. (<a href=""http://www.siliconw.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.siliconw.com</a>)</p>
<p>As it has been increasingly difficult for designers to find work in North America specifically, The Live App Design platform enables design companies or designers to still use their design skills to generate income by taking care of all the coding for them.</p>
<p>Any small to medium business looking to spend under $5000 (or a monthly fee of $200-300) so that they can have their own mobile app is now able to work directly with a designer to make it happen.  No coding required!  An existing design partner could use our platform to create apps for their current customer base!</p>
<p>Our hosting fee is $10/month which enables end user downloads and access to the portal so that designers and/or their customers can update the content.  This is what we hope to be our main source of direct revenue from the project.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>We need funds to be able to create focused marketing programs that spread the word about our platform and the opportunities it creates for existing designers.  The funds will be used to drive internet advertising, traditional print advertising and to foster partnerships with existing design companies and software companies (We hope Adobe reads this).</p>
<p>Using our talent pool at SiliconW we will create custom apps for your company in return for helping us finance the marketing of our platform. We will work with you to ensure your app is exactly what you want and then give you access to change the content in any way you like.<br/>In a nutshell: WE WILL CREATE A CUSTOM MOBILE APP FOR YOU.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<div>LiveApp will help to fund our SiliconW Tech-Art fusion community center.  Our goal is to help young students and grads that have little work experience with real-world, hands-on opportunities to grow their skills.  In addition, our gallery features works from mostly undiscovered artists in an effort to raise their exposure as well as provide them with assistance and guidance getting their presence online via websites and mobile apps.</div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please spread the word about our platform and feel free to ask us any questions you may have!  We're very excited about the opportunities our platform presents and hope that you feel the same way too!  There are built in tools on indiegogo to help spread the word via Twitter, Facebook and email.</p>

<h3>Is Touchtype Pro the best iPad Keyboard case?</h3>
<p>While growing up, my family and friends knew me as the “tech guy” and would often ask, “what [phone, laptop, etc.] should I buy?”</p>
<p>Sometimes the answer was clear (""get an iPhone""), but every so often I'd have to ask  ""what’s important to you?""</p>
<p>And it’s the same situation here. </p>
<p>The Touchtype Pro is not for everyone. Here are a few reasons why you may want to consider something else:</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> Since it relies on the Apple Magic Keyboard, that means it needs to be recharged separately. It also means that you’ll need to remember to turn it off when you’ve packed it away since key presses can wake up the iPad.</p>
<p>If this is important to you, then I’d recommend the Apple Smart Folio Keyboard as your best bet since it’s the only case that uses the Smart Connector.</p>
<p><strong>Backlighting:</strong> Another limitation of the Apple Magic Keyboard is that the keys are not backlit. I like to work in the dark sometimes and  appreciate the subtle key illumination on my Macbook Pro.</p>
<p>There are a few solutions that turn your iPad into a laptop on the market, but I'd personally recommend the Brydge. Like Touchtype, Brydge also got its start on Kickstarter and their keyboard incorporates many features found in today's laptops (i.e, backlighting, adjustable angles).</p>
<p><strong>Weight:</strong> Predictably, the Apple Magic Keyboard and extra protection make Touchtype one of the heavier options when the keyboard is inside. Here’s a comparison using the 12.9 iPad Pro as an example:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Apple Smart Keyboard Folio 12.9:</strong> 0.9 lb<br/>+ iPad Pro 12.9”: 1.4 lb<br/>+ Apple Pencil: .05 lb<br/><strong>Total: 2.35 lb</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Brydge 12.9”:</strong> 1.51 lb<br/>+ iPad Pro 12.9”: 1.4 lb<br/>+ Apple Pencil: .05 lb<br/><strong>Total: 2.96 lb</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Touchtype Folio 12.9”:</strong> 1.2 lb<br/>+ iPad Pro 12.9”: 1.4 lb<br/>+ Apple Pencil: .05 lb<br/>Touchtype Keyboard Case: .25 lb<br/>+ Apple Magic Keyboard: 0.51 lb<br/><strong>Total: Folio/iPad/Pencil (2.65 lb) + Keyboard/Case (0.76 lb) = 3.41 lb</strong></p>
<p>Without the keyboard, folio portion is lighter (2.65 lb) than the Brydge, but the extra material needed for protection and keyboard connectivity keep whole package three-tenths of a pound heavier than the Smart Keyboard Folio. So if weight is the primary concern — and you can only afford one iPad case — then I’d recommend you go for the Smart Keyboard Folio.<br/> </p>
<h3>Touchtype Pro is the best keyboard for you if…</h3>
<p>You’re already using, or would like to explore using, the Apple Magic Keyboard with your iPad.</p>
<p>You already know the Apple Magic Keyboard’s constraints with regards to Bluetooth, backlighting and weight but prefer what it gives you in return — a <strong>familiar, full-size, tactile, typing experience.</strong></p>
<p>If this sounds like you, then <strong>you’ll love Touchtype Pro.</strong></p> <p>It’s important to me that you find the best keyboard solution for you — even if it’s not Touchtype — for two reasons.</p>
<p>One, it means that those who do choose Touchtype will be more satisfied since they will have made an informed decision beforehand, after knowing all the pros and cons.</p>
<p>Two, it means that iPad users will be more satisfied with their keyboard choice overall. This, in turn, will put pressure on companies (including Apple) to continue to push the platform forward.</p>

Very first paper prototype
I knew plastic molds were expensive, so I wanted to see if I could make it out of soft materials. Here is one of the early prototypes I got made during a trip to Vietnam.

Early leather-based prototype
I wasn’t satisfied with the fit and finish so I decided to make a simpler version and launched it on Kickstarter in 2012.

My hope was that this would provide the financial runway for me to created the plastic-based case that I really wanted.

But it wasn’t to be.
The manufacturers I was working with had some consistent quality issues  and Apple then released the iPad Air, which weren’t compatible with whatever inventory I had.

Inventory in my garage for the first campaign
It was at this point that I decided to shelve Touchtype.
Fast Forward to Q4 2015. Apple releases the Magic Keyboard, iPad Pro and Apple Pencil. I, and my bank account, had recovered so I felt compelled to give it another shot.
I updated the designs and started looking for manufacturers.

Pitch deck to manufacturers
It was not until 2018 that I finally found a competent and trustworthy manufacturer. They truly understood the vision and went above and beyond to help me get to this point.

<p>Since we started prototyping in April 2015, we have iterated, redesigned and tested, over and over again, in order to make something we can be truly proud of. Using 3D printers, we have built a new prototype almost every week. Building the world’s most versatile smartphone stabilizer requires every single part of the product to be perfect.</p>

 It’s hard to capture smooth video with your smartphone, we’ve all been there. You think you captured the perfect moment, but it ends up as a crappy memory.We're FlowMotion and as adventurers, travelers and techies, we believe that great moments should be captured in the best possible way. That’s why we made FlowMotion™ ONE - the world’s most versatile smartphone stabilizer.

 

 

 
  
Absolutely not! Our mission is to put an end to shaky videos and make professional videography available for everyone. FlowMotion™ ONE is developed by engineers, designers, and professional videographers, made for everyone to capture everyday moments.

 



 

FlowMotion™ ONE eliminates camera shake so you can capture every moment in perfect quality. 
 

FlowMotion™ ONE only weighs 300g and fits in your pocket. Simply detach the grip and fold the stabilizer.

 

Mount ONE to any camera mount, GoPro mount or to the optional carbon extension pole. The grip and joystick enable you to control the stabilizer, even while using the extension pole.

 

Share vibration-free and professional looking videos on Snapchat and Instagram.
 

 

Advanced auto follow technology built into the FlowMotion™ app allows you to always have YOU, or someone you care about in focus. Simply mark the person on the screen, and ONE will follow and keep them in the frame, no matter how they move.
Never miss a moment.

In pan mode, you smartphone is fixed in the vertical direction, but pans smoothly when you move from side to side. Pan mode is perfect for most situations, whether ONE is mounted on your bike or on a FlowMotion™ pole or handle.

In lock mode your phone is fixed relative to all axis and stands perfectly still, no matter how you move.

In pan + tilt mode your smartphone will move smoothly in all directions, while at the same time, compensating for vibration and sudden movement.

Unlock the full potential of your ONE with the FlowMotion™ app. Access features such as motion time-lapse, panorama, and professional video shooting modes – or create your own custom presets. Use the app to view and organize all your media, and keep the product firmware up to date.

Exact shipping rates will vary depending on destination, but will not exceed 50 USD per reward. FlowMotion™ rewards will be shipped according to Kickstarter pledge order. If you want your FlowMotion™ ONE soon, you should move fast!

 

 


Since we started prototyping in April 2015, we have iterated, redesigned and tested, over and over again, in order to make something we can be truly proud of. Using 3D printers, we have built a new prototype almost every week. Building the world’s most versatile smartphone stabilizer requires every single part of the product to be perfect.

 

Most stabilizers use hobbyist electronics, which are often overpriced and underpowered for a consumer-grade product.
FlowMotion™ ONE’s high-quality electronics are durable, energy efficient and designed with surface-mount components in mind. All parts are carefully chosen to be optimized for mass production.

 

 

Our state-of-the-art control system and algorithms is the core of ONE and keeps your smartphone perfectly stable even when you’re not. By using sensors and our advanced 3D stabilization software, three high precision electric motors rotates your smartphone (at 1000 Hz) to compensate for vibration and shaking.


Design DOES matter. Or at least, we think so. Collaborating with award-winning EGGS design, we created FlowMotion™ ONE to be functional, ergonomic, versatile and also to be rapidly and inexpensively manufactured.

 

 

 

 

We teamed up with our manufacturing partner, Protolab, almost a year ago. With over 30 years of experience they know how to get consumer electronics products to market. In addition to working closely with them on design for manufacturability (DFM), packaging and assembly, they are accommodating critical support on-the-ground in China and have sourced outstanding suppliers.

 

 

 

 

 

 

With FlowMotion™ ONE, anyone can produce professional-looking videos and share them with the world. Our team also has a lot of ideas for great products in the future that we want to build. But, we can’t do it alone. Right now, YOU can choose which projects and technologies become a reality.
Help us bring the most versatile smartphone stabilizer to the masses by backing us now.

Why not?</p><p>You like to drink responsibly; you care about your friends, family members, and co-workers and want to ensure they travel safely. Are you often out at the club or bar?

Slip it into your college-bound child’s car.</p><p>Breathalyzers don’t need to just be for police; they can be a tool for everyone to prevent tragic accidents. There are millions of alcohol-impaired driving episodes each year, many resulting in fatal accidents. If having a breathalyzer was as common as having a smartphone, we believe there would be far fewer. WearSmith is the best choice for a person to drink safe and responsibly.</p><ul></ul><p> </p><p><strong>OUR STORY</strong></p><p>The idea came to me last summer when a friend of mine had too much to drink at my BBQ party and insisted on driving home. I feared for his safety, but he wouldn't accept that he was too drunk to drive and I couldn't convince him or stop him.<br/>I think we can all agree that driving is not such a good idea after drinking. The problem I’ve noticed, however, is that it can be hard to convince someone that they’re not able to drive.

It's the easiest way to know your breath alcohol concentration in a short time. The Smartphone Application will analyze how long it will take you to recover and counts down until you’re sober enough to drive . It will notify you by linking to the tester via Bluetooth smart technology. You can also use it standalone, and it will show the result on the OLED display.We won the COMPUTEX d&i awards, organized by the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) and executed by the International Forum Design (iF).   WearSmith is designed to be your personal accessory. It’s as light as an eraser – only 19g (0.7 oz) – you can easily slip it in your pocket, jacket, or bag. The classic mistake we make when we drink is thinking we’re OK to drive in the moment. Why not take WearSmith with you and objectively find out if it’s safe for you or your friend to get behind the wheel?Easy, convenient, and safe. Sounds reasonable.WearSmith is available in four colors to match your personality or clothing style:
Navy blue
White
Rose gold
Red
How does it work?Our team made WearSmith as user-friendly as possible and we are striving to improve it. Our goal was making WearSmith convenient for anyone’s day-to-day life. You can easily wear it as a necklace or clip it on your keychain. Its diamond shape mirrors that of an ice cube. Worried about drinking past your limit? Just squeeze it, blow, and get a measurement in a few seconds. No costly mouthpieces, no waste, and no complicated settings.  Just blow and wait for the results!Blow steadily and continuously for 5 seconds Your BAC measurement is read directly on the OLED display or on your smartphone by a secure Bluetooth connection.We also developed a companion app with extra features and options. It analyzes how long it will take you to recover and counts down until you’re sober enough to drive. It also advises you when your BAC is too high to call a friend, cab, or anyone to come pick you up, just in case. It’s available on iOS and Android.After setting up a personal profile and setting your emergency contacts, the app will notify you as you take measurements with adorable manga-style characters reflecting your drinking status. RESULTSMeet the seven manga-style characters that will reflect your drinking status.  WHY use it ?WearSmith is easy to use and take anywhere. Its compact footprint is unobtrusive and hassle-free. To boot, it’s more affordable and effective than competitors. Who should use it?If having a breathalyzer were as easy as having a tiny gadget on your keychain, wouldn’t you use it? Why not?You like to drink responsibly; you care about your friends, family members, and co-workers and want to ensure they travel safely. Are you often out at the club or bar? Get yourself a WearSmith and stay on top of how much you’ve actually had to drink, not how much you think you’ve had.Give it to your party-animal roommate you’re concerned about. Slip it into your college-bound child’s car.Breathalyzers don’t need to just be for police; they can be a tool for everyone to prevent tragic accidents. There are millions of alcohol-impaired driving episodes each year, many resulting in fatal accidents. If having a breathalyzer was as common as having a smartphone, we believe there would be far fewer. WearSmith is the best choice for a person to drink safe and responsibly. OUR STORYThe idea came to me last summer when a friend of mine had too much to drink at my BBQ party and insisted on driving home. I feared for his safety, but he wouldn't accept that he was too drunk to drive and I couldn't convince him or stop him.I think we can all agree that driving is not such a good idea after drinking. The problem I’ve noticed, however, is that it can be hard to convince someone that they’re not able to drive. With WearSmith you can objectively prove to the person that they’ve had too much; there is no need to fret about persuading them.  That is why we created this small, accurate gadget to help you making the right decision and prevent accidents.Our team also realized that breathalyzers are largely too big, expensive, and slow to be practically carried around by most people: WearSmith was born.

news to share with you! Our developers started to play with the idea of TRACOM
in high definition, so it could be capable to display photos or commercial and
promotional pictures. If we succeed with our campaign, and our TRACOM display
is being sold and mass manufactured, we will have means to finish and test this
idea. In this case it would not be only for car rear windows, but also for shop
windows, restaurant windows and many other places.</b></p><b><br/>TRACOM
HISTORY</b><p></p>
<p>We have been engaged with modern technologies
and LED lighting for last several years. </p>
<p>We came up with the idea to create a
communication display based on OLED technology, which enables you to
communicate briefly with other drivers, and which enables the participants of
public traffic to help drivers in emergency situations.</p>
<p>Since 2013 we have developed this idea based on
OLED technology and in summer 2013 we created TRACOM prototype. We also started
communication with Chinese upfront OLED manufacturers.</p><p></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>WHY
DO YOU NEED TRACOM</b></p>
<p>TRACOM contributes to safety of public traffic
and can be an important helper in emergency situations. In cases of a vehicle
breakdown or in a case of a taxi assault, you can signalize your message on the
vehicle rear window.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/439492/files/20140317085141-5.jpg?1395071501"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/439494/files/20140317085202-6.jpg?1395071522"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>You can use the display in everyday situations,
for example you need to briefly park on a place which is not perfectly
appropriate for parking and you can turn on your message „WILL BE RIGHT BACK”.</p>
<p>Imagine you are in a traffic jam and a driver
who has priority gives you a way, TRACOM can help you communicate with this text:
“THANK YOU”.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/439497/files/20140317085236-1.jpg?1395071556"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>With TRACOM

IS TRACOM</b></p>
<p>TRACOM is a communication display constructed
from a transparent and flexible foil. This foil is manufactured on the OLED
technology bases; it is capable of reflecting the enlightened text on the rear
window of your car. </p>
<p><b>TRACOM is transparent
so it does not affect the drivers view into the space behind a vehicle.</b></p>
<p>Power supply unit is a part of the display, and
all you need is 2 AA batteries. There is a Bluetooth receiver in the power
supply unit, which enables communication between TRACOM mobile phone
application and the display itself.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>TRACOM
MOBILE PHONE APPLICATION</b></p>
<p>TRACOM mobile phone application is for smart
phones with both Apple Ios and Android. Just run the application and click on
one of the clauses, the application sends it via Bluetooth to the power unit
connected with the display and this message displays itself on your car rear
window. You can also select “WRITE NEW MESSAGE” and you write your own text. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/439508/files/20140317085408-7.jpg?1395071648"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/439509/files/20140317085416-9.jpg?1395071656"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>TRACOM

Traffic
CommunicatorWe have interesting
news to share with you! Our developers started to play with the idea of TRACOM
in high definition, so it could be capable to display photos or commercial and
promotional pictures. If we succeed with our campaign, and our TRACOM display
is being sold and mass manufactured, we will have means to finish and test this
idea. In this case it would not be only for car rear windows, but also for shop
windows, restaurant windows and many other places.TRACOM
HISTORY
We have been engaged with modern technologies
and LED lighting for last several years. 
We came up with the idea to create a
communication display based on OLED technology, which enables you to
communicate briefly with other drivers, and which enables the participants of
public traffic to help drivers in emergency situations.
Since 2013 we have developed this idea based on
OLED technology and in summer 2013 we created TRACOM prototype. We also started
communication with Chinese upfront OLED manufacturers.WHY
DO YOU NEED TRACOM
TRACOM contributes to safety of public traffic
and can be an important helper in emergency situations. In cases of a vehicle
breakdown or in a case of a taxi assault, you can signalize your message on the
vehicle rear window.You can use the display in everyday situations,
for example you need to briefly park on a place which is not perfectly
appropriate for parking and you can turn on your message „WILL BE RIGHT BACK”.
Imagine you are in a traffic jam and a driver
who has priority gives you a way, TRACOM can help you communicate with this text:
“THANK YOU”.With TRACOM
you can also express yourself with a text: “SORRY”.
Not only
you can use preselected texts, you can also create your own message!WHAT
IS TRACOM
TRACOM is a communication display constructed
from a transparent and flexible foil. This foil is manufactured on the OLED
technology bases; it is capable of reflecting the enlightened text on the rear
window of your car. 
TRACOM is transparent
so it does not affect the drivers view into the space behind a vehicle.
Power supply unit is a part of the display, and
all you need is 2 AA batteries. There is a Bluetooth receiver in the power
supply unit, which enables communication between TRACOM mobile phone
application and the display itself.
TRACOM
MOBILE PHONE APPLICATION
TRACOM mobile phone application is for smart
phones with both Apple Ios and Android. Just run the application and click on
one of the clauses, the application sends it via Bluetooth to the power unit
connected with the display and this message displays itself on your car rear
window. You can also select “WRITE NEW MESSAGE” and you write your own text. TRACOM
TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
TRACOM dimensions: 
Maximum dimensions at the moment are 20x80cm.
Also we are testing different dimensions. 
Maximum amount of symbols to be displayed on
the foil is 10, there are 2 visual cycles.
For example “Call me” is part of the first visual
cycle and the telephone number 775 123 456 is part of the second
visual cycle.
We do not develop third visual cycle at the
moment due to reasons of safety in public traffic. 
Preselected colors:
Red, yellow, blue, green
Because of public traffic safety, TRACOM can
not portrait pictures, photographs nor videos.
TRACOM can only display text, numbers and
symbols. TRACOM is a communicative foil, not means to display a lighting
commercial or photographs. 
Text display duration
settings:
There are several preselected display duration
settings:
30s, 1m, 2m, 3m, 5m, 10m + Until you turn it
off
In an emergency case of the preselected text
“HELP ME – CALL 911”, the clause HELP ME turns on and within the interval of 3
seconds it blinks 3 times, after that the text CALL 911 displays for 3 seconds.
This cycle repeats itself until you turn it off.

In case of using the clause CALL ME, this text
blinks 3 times within 3 seconds and then the phone number displays for 10
seconds. This cycle repeats itself until you turn it off.WHAT WILL WE USE YOUR
DONATIONS FOR

access to electricity.Our first product is a portable solar lantern that is easy
to use and costs just $12, a price that is affordable for most people.The ProblemWhatever their reasons, African governments have failed in
their duty to provide basic infrastructure such as electricity to the majority
of their population. The situation is such that in many African countries, less than 1/4 of the population has access to electricity. Source: World BankAs a result, many people, especially in rural areas, still
rely on solutions that their grandparents relied upon, like kerosene lamps.There are many disadvantages to kerosene lamps and here are
some of them:1. Poor quality of lightAs you can see from the pictures above, with kerosene light it’s
difficult to see from just one metre away. School children who use them to do
homework would have to seat really close to the lamp, which increases their
exposure to the hazardous smoke.  (see the full
comparison in the video above)2. Pollution 
Much of the fuel from Kerosene lamps turns into pollutant
smoke. Research has shown that kerosene lamps add up to 3% to global black
carbon emissions.
Source: niehs.nih.gov3. Health risksThe World Bank estimates that breathing kerosene fumes is the equivalent of smoking two packets of cigarettes a day.Also from the World bank; two-thirds of adult females with lung cancer in developing nations are non-smokers. Source: BBCCostIn Uganda the average kerosene user spends $0.20 on fuel, that
will power the lamp for 4 hours. For low income families $0.20 can mean 10% or
20% of their daily income. And on days when there’s no money to buy the fuel, the
whole family has to go to bed as soon as it gets dark. Our solutionWe have created a solar lantern that is much, much brighter
than a kerosene lamp.It certainly does not polluteIt charges under sunlight, stores the energy in
its rechargeable batteries and uses an energy efficient LED bulb. The batteries
can last over 2 years.Battery life is 12 hours when fully charged; this ensures
that even if the user misses a day of charging, a rainy day for example, there
will still be enough energy for them to use (the average user needs light for 4
hours).And most importantly for the target customer; it’s
cheaper than kerosene use  The solar lantern costs $12, this is a one off cost and it
comes with a 1 year warranty.
If you compare that to the cost of kerosene fuel, which is
$0.20 per day, you can see that the lantern will pay for itself in just 60
days. Why we need your helpWe currently make these lanterns using the home-made tools
pictured above (You can see the making process
in our video). We had a limited budget from the beginning but felt it was
important to prove the product was feasible before trying to raise capital. We
have proven that the product is feasible but have been unable to raise the
capital we need to buy machinery. In Uganda
there are no venture capitalists or angel investors and every bank we’ve spoken
to wants collateral. With this IndieGoGo campaign, we are hoping to raise money
to; 

Buy plastic moulding machinery

Rent factory space


If we raise enough money, we would also;

Work on a solar mobile phone charger (many customers
inquire about this).
Work on a brighter version of our solar lantern.

<p>Our fresh perspective on the computing ecosystem makes it as easy to build your environment—<span>and as personal—as playing with Legos. And, this modular concept is cost-effective, allowing you to change or upgrade your computing components at any time. </span></p>
<p>We’ve separated the traditional, integrated architecture of the PC into key components: the processor, data storage, display, keyboard, and peripherals. This design concept facilitates dynamic plug-and-play of ICE processors and all peripherals through matched connectors. </p>At the heart of the design concept is the xPC (processor). The xPC drives everything, and you can easily assemble, or upgrade. No need for tools or technical knowledge.

<p>When it’s time to upgrade your PC you would, traditionally, have to buy an entirely new device. Because there is no component sharing or reuse, an upgrade is expensive and creates e-waste. The ICE xPC is designed with the future, flexibility, and sustainability in mind. Its one-for-all, all-for-one design makes interchanging components easy, thereby facilitating upgrades while minimizing waste.</p>
<p>To upgrade, you simply purchase a new ICE xPC and plug it into your existing ICE peripherals. This novel, modular computer system can save you time, considerably reduce your expense, and help minimize the long-term environmental impact.</p>
<p>The ease of upgrading and cost savings are particularly useful for business operations. As your employee base and markets grow, you can continue to shrink your IT requirements and costs. Additionally, the xPC is an optimal mobility solution for businesses with remote or mobile sales and support staff.<span>  <br/></span></p><p><span></span></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/317930/files/20140119151508-Compare.png?1390173308"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><i>Sharing xPC and Upgrading xPC Only is More Cost-effective Than Traditional Systems</i><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p>

<h2 style=""color: #0096bb;"">Mission Impossible for Start-Ups? No – We Did It!</h2>
<p>The initial inspiration behind ICE Computer was the appearance of the Apple iPad in April 2010. The iPad introduced the media tablet to consumers. As a result, the ICE Computer team began to envision the future. If a company could create a media tablet, then what would come next?<span> Could the industry evolve into a yet unknown post-PC era?</span></p>
<p><span>Facing this challenge head-on, ICE Computer started thinking about the next steps that would lead consumers down the post-PC path and concluded the following:</span></p>
<p><span><b>Brain in pocket - </b>new, small device in our pocket that can do a similar job to a laptop.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Computing anytime anywhere - </b>devices offer new, pleasant user experiences for worldwide consumers where they can enjoy business and personal computing as much in the office, lab, Starbucks, libraries, or schools, as they do at home.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Easy upgrade - </b>hassle free plug-and-play computer upgrades; existing applications and documents will not need to be moved over to the new system.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Dynamic -</b> device flexible enough to be a pad, notebook, desktop, or many others - when and where people need it.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Cloud services -</b> thin client devices can access applications, data, and even instantly download/boot lightweight operating systems from clouds, anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Eco-friendly -</b> devices with better, lighter, and cheaper components that can be easily shared, reused, or recycled.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>To define these objectives, we had several brainstorming sessions to envision exactly what the 'post-PC' era was. During one session we were discussing the fact that Apple's iPad is basically a version of the iPhone with a larger display. Our founder, Shang-Che Cheng then said, ""Hey, what consumers really need is a modular computer!"" Cheng continued, ""A pocket PC as small as smartphone that can be shared and become the core of everything such as a Pad, a notebook, a set-top-box, etc., which is cost-effective and reduces e-waste.""<br/></span></p>
<p><span>The ICE team then derived the idea of a next-generation, completely modular computer platform to expand consumer choices. No longer would consumers need to decide on a computer that best suited their needs of the day: desktop, laptop, or tablet. With the ICE Computer platform, consumers can purchase a single 'core intelligence' (xPC) and design a desktop, laptop, tablet, or all three by combining the xPC with the complementary components!</span></p>
<p><span><b>DESIGN</b></span></p>
<p><span>Our modular platform had to be innovative and flexible; it had to be cost-effective; and, it had to be Eco-friendly. We've gone to extraordinary lengths and overcome a number of challenges to initially create the ICE xPC, then the components - each within a 6-month timeframe.</span></p>
<p><span>The biggest challenge we faced in evolving the xPC was the ability to squeeze all of that traditional, large PC technology into a smartphone-size chassis. We had to consider not only the space limitations, but heat dissipation. The latter being a consideration for the components as well. We overcame these issues by increasing the printed circuit board layers to 10 to be able to reside <b>more than four thousands</b> of interconnected tiny circuits, while maintaining a 1mm or less thickness. Our innovative thermal module for heat dissipation of non-fanless processors took care of the heat dissipation issue, separating the heat sink and cooling fan and ensuring proper air flow conduction.</span></p>
<p><span>To effectively manage the communication between the ICE xPC and peripherals, we designed an embedded control unit into each along with control software. The control unit and software form a master/slave relationship between the xPC and its peripherals to facilitate performance as a single, integrated PC when connected.</span></p>
<p><span><b>PROTOTYPE</b></span></p>
<p><span>Our first challenge was how to create prototypes of our designs with the limited resources we had. While we considered both ODM (Original Design Manufacturing) and OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturing) for this, the requirements were too restrictive for our small operation and neither could sufficiently fulfill what we envisioned for our products.</span></p>We made the decision to build the prototypes ourselves. We presented our platform to a leading chip maker. Their team was so excited about our novel and total solution that they immediately gave us access to their latest chip set information and its reference designs. We used this information as the basis for our board and heat dissipation designs. <br/><br/>Instead of presenting computer hardware terms only, please allow us to explain development procedures/terms a little bit for easy understanding: <br/><br/><ul>
<li>Industrial design – design look and feel of a new device </li>
<li>Mechanical design - ensure parts are production-able; design moving parts, such as open/close doors, housing, and connector, etc. </li>
<li>Schematics, layout/placement – detail engine/cpu and electronic designs </li>
<li>PCBA, tooling – build and assemble parts, motherboard, and housing </li>
<li>Firmware – create control software </li>
<li>Testing – perform engineering, design, and production tests </li>
</ul>We outsourced the Industry Design (ID) to ensure aesthetic appeal and ease of user-interface of the products, and the Mechanical Design for analysis, design, manufacturing, and maintenance of mechanical systems. Our chief hardware architect worked on the xPC's schematics (electronic diagram) and board layout (electronic components placement and connection) designs.<br/><br/>With the board layout design completed, we delivered the xPC Gerber file to a contract printed circuit board manufacturer located in Taiwan to produce the circuit boards for us. The Gerber file format is the defacto industry standard for printed circuit board image transfer, and describes the printed circuit board image's copper layers, solder mask, legend, drill holes, etc. Whoever has the Gerber file can manufacture the same product with little effort. However this is not an issue with the xPC, since it is protected by our separated control software and peripherals that make up the xPC.<br/><br/>While the circuit boards were being produced, we delivered the Industry and Mechanical designs to a ""soft"" tooling company to make the xPC plastic chassis. Soft tooling is an excellent solution for sample manufacturing as it is low cost and gave us more flexibility in case a design change was needed prior to production. A week later, we had assembled the first xPC prototype!<br/><br/>Finally, we needed to be able to test the integration. For this we developed a simple adapter as our testing vehicle. We connected the xPC to this adapter and successfully converted a HDTV into a TVPC! And our simple adapter subsequently became the ICE xAdapter.<br/><br/>Our entire xPC platform is now ready to move to production. ICE Computer is consistently delivering on our vision, and continuing to innovate:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>2012 Computex - Taipei, Taiwan. Demonstrated the xPC, xAdapter, and xKeyboard. <br/>
</li>
<li>2013 Consumer Electronic Show (CES) - Las Vegas, Nevada, US. Six months later, we demonstrated the xPad mobile display with xPC. <br/>
</li>
<li>2013 Computex - Taipei, Taiwan. Six months after CES, we demonstrated the 6-in-1 xTop mini desktop prototype. </li>
<li>2014 Consumer Electronic Show (CES) - Las Vegas, Nevada, US. <b>If you are attending the CES, we cordially invite you to visit us from 1/7 to 1/10 at the Monte Carlo Resort, suite # 20001 for a private product introduction.</b><br/>
</li>
</ul><p>Since the launch of the xPC, we have successfully delivered new components every 6 months. Our next major focus is on incorporating the latest Intel Atom processors into the xPC to deliver higher CPU performance at production.</p>
<p></p>
<h2 style=""color: #0096bb;"">Open Architecture<br/>
</h2>When a PC is the size of a smartphone, the possibilities are unlimited! The ICE xPC open connector architecture facilitates the use of existing peripherals and provides developers with the opportunity to create peripherals or accessories as needed. <br/><p></p>
<p>For example, you could select a low cost gaming “shell” or “docking” device in your favorite color, display size, and with control buttons “only”, and simply plug the ICE xPC™ core processor into the gaming device to play your games.<span>  This gives you the power of the ICE xPC behind the gaming gear that suits you.</span><br/></p>
<p>At ICE Computer, our fundamental philosophy is to create core technologies and development kits to assist developers in joining the computing revolution. We want to empower developers to become computing innovators and support new business ventures. </p>

<h2 style=""color: #0096bb;"">Current Challenges &amp; Risk</h2>
<p>People have been discussing modular computers for decades. However, very few companies (including the ‘big brand’ shops) have actually introduced a truly modular computer. To date, modular systems have had significant limitations or obstacles, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design limitations of the motherboard when it is broken down into several interconnected boards</li>
<li>Components that are confined inside the same chassis</li>
<li>Component feature flaws</li>
</ul><p>The ‘modular’ PCs available today are typically difficult to upgrade, a flaw some attribute to marketing schemes which require users to re-purchase new models every few years in order to stay current with technology. </p>
<p><b>ENGINEERING </b></p>
<p>Since very few manufacturers offer modular computers, it requires computer savvy and knowledge to identify proper sections that allow easy interchange and facilitate upgrades. Unlike traditional “in-chassis” approaches, we have successfully identified and separated key functional components into modules, each with their own small chassis.<span>  </span></p>
<p>This approach will allow consumers to be more closely aligned with new technologies, and makes purchasing new, advanced components more cost-effective. </p>
<p><b>MANUFACTURING </b></p>
<p>ICE Computer has high confidence in our demonstrated and tested technology. The challenge we currently face is funding to enable mass production.</p>
<p>In preparation for manufacturing, we have:<span>  </span></p>
<ul>
<li>Engineered our platform of products for mass-manufacturing</li>
<li>Built and tested the pre-production units </li>
<li>Applied for, and passed, government regulations on pre-production units</li>
<li>Partnered with a select manufacturer in Taiwan or China in preparation for mass production</li>
<li>Identified distribution partners for packaging and shipping</li>
</ul><p>With only a handful of PC manufacturers globally, 60% of the world's notebook PCs and the majority of PC components for desktops are manufactured in Taiwan. Therefore, we have established a team in Taiwan to work directly with the manufacturers. This team will oversee operations and assist with mitigating any risk. </p>
<p>Our Atom xPC production plan is as follows:</p>

</h2>

<p><b>Q. What does ICE stand for, and who is ICE?</b></p>
<p><b>A.</b> ICE Computer is a provider of modular computers for Internet, Communication, and Entertainment (ICE™). We are a startup company with an R&amp;D team in Silicon Valley and a manufacturing team in Taiwan. Our founders are experienced entrepreneurs from Silicon Valley with backgrounds as co-founder/CEO/CTO of several companies, experienced with startups, technology building, operations, and M&amp;A activities. We have been working on modular computers for more than two years.</p>
<p><b>Q. What are the benefits of the ICE xPC modular computer?</b></p>
<p><b>A.</b> A modular computer is much smaller, lighter, and more flexible than anything else currently available. Its modularization enables more product offerings, customization, and localization through dynamic module combinations. The sharing and reuse of modules eliminates the costs of buying multiple software licenses and redundant hardware. Another feature is the ease of upgrading the ICE xPC. The ICE xPC is a green computing designed with the future and sustainability in mind. The ICE xPC is one-for-all or all-for-one for easy interchange and to facilitate upgrades. To upgrade, you just simply plug-and-play a new ICE xPC into existing peripherals and reuse them, which creates minimal electronic waste. This novel modular computer can save you a considerable amount of money as well as help save the environment.</p>
<p><b>Q. How does the ICE xPC dissipate heat? </b></p>
<p><b>A.</b> It depends on its CPU’s thermal design power (TDP): some high power ICE xPC’s use a heatsink and fan to dissipate heat like a traditional laptop computer. </p><b>Q. Do you have patents?</b>
<p><b>A.</b> We have many novel inventions and have already filed more than 10 patent applications in major countries, including the USA, Japan, China, Taiwan, and the EU. </p>
<p><b>Q. Why does the ICE xPC™ not have its own integrated display screen?</b></p>
<p><b>A.</b> Flexibility is what we have in mind when designing this product. The ICE xPC allows users to pick “task base form factor” such as a 5"" portable LCD or a 24"" monitor that provides the best display for a given project. It also allows users to use already-owned display devices even include your smartphone’s display if it supports wireless display.</p><p><b>Q. When are other ICE peripherals available?</b></p>
<p><b>A.</b> We have prototyped the ICE xTop (mini-desktop), and ICE xKeyboard, etc. However we are working on multiple touches for better gesture operation for xKeyboard's integrated Trackpad and Space Bar. We are planning to launch xTop as a separated funding project soon. We will release detail information later when these products are ready for production.</p>

The New Ecosystem
Our fresh perspective on the computing ecosystem makes it as easy to build your environment—and as personal—as playing with Legos. And, this modular concept is cost-effective, allowing you to change or upgrade your computing components at any time. 
We’ve separated the traditional, integrated architecture of the PC into key components: the processor, data storage, display, keyboard, and peripherals. This design concept facilitates dynamic plug-and-play of ICE processors and all peripherals through matched connectors. At the heart of the design concept is the xPC (processor). The xPC drives everything, and you can easily assemble, or upgrade. No need for tools or technical knowledge. And no need to replace your entire PC!ICE Modular Computer

Simply Plug and Play xPC with ICE Peripherals to Create the Tablet, Mini-PC or Set-up-Box Device That You Need Dynamic and Easy Upgrade With Different CoresDock xPC into xAdapter (That Connected to a Display) to Create the Mini-PC You Need At Office or Home

Cost-Effective and Eco-Friendly
When it’s time to upgrade your PC you would, traditionally, have to buy an entirely new device. Because there is no component sharing or reuse, an upgrade is expensive and creates e-waste. The ICE xPC is designed with the future, flexibility, and sustainability in mind. Its one-for-all, all-for-one design makes interchanging components easy, thereby facilitating upgrades while minimizing waste.
To upgrade, you simply purchase a new ICE xPC and plug it into your existing ICE peripherals. This novel, modular computer system can save you time, considerably reduce your expense, and help minimize the long-term environmental impact.
The ease of upgrading and cost savings are particularly useful for business operations. As your employee base and markets grow, you can continue to shrink your IT requirements and costs. Additionally, the xPC is an optimal mobility solution for businesses with remote or mobile sales and support staff.  Sharing xPC and Upgrading xPC Only is More Cost-effective Than Traditional Systems

Mission Impossible for Start-Ups? No – We Did It!
The initial inspiration behind ICE Computer was the appearance of the Apple iPad in April 2010. The iPad introduced the media tablet to consumers. As a result, the ICE Computer team began to envision the future. If a company could create a media tablet, then what would come next? Could the industry evolve into a yet unknown post-PC era?
Facing this challenge head-on, ICE Computer started thinking about the next steps that would lead consumers down the post-PC path and concluded the following:
Brain in pocket - new, small device in our pocket that can do a similar job to a laptop.
Computing anytime anywhere - devices offer new, pleasant user experiences for worldwide consumers where they can enjoy business and personal computing as much in the office, lab, Starbucks, libraries, or schools, as they do at home.
Easy upgrade - hassle free plug-and-play computer upgrades; existing applications and documents will not need to be moved over to the new system.
Dynamic - device flexible enough to be a pad, notebook, desktop, or many others - when and where people need it.
Cloud services - thin client devices can access applications, data, and even instantly download/boot lightweight operating systems from clouds, anywhere.
Eco-friendly - devices with better, lighter, and cheaper components that can be easily shared, reused, or recycled.
To define these objectives, we had several brainstorming sessions to envision exactly what the 'post-PC' era was. During one session we were discussing the fact that Apple's iPad is basically a version of the iPhone with a larger display. Our founder, Shang-Che Cheng then said, ""Hey, what consumers really need is a modular computer!"" Cheng continued, ""A pocket PC as small as smartphone that can be shared and become the core of everything such as a Pad, a notebook, a set-top-box, etc., which is cost-effective and reduces e-waste.""
The ICE team then derived the idea of a next-generation, completely modular computer platform to expand consumer choices. No longer would consumers need to decide on a computer that best suited their needs of the day: desktop, laptop, or tablet. With the ICE Computer platform, consumers can purchase a single 'core intelligence' (xPC) and design a desktop, laptop, tablet, or all three by combining the xPC with the complementary components!
DESIGN
Our modular platform had to be innovative and flexible; it had to be cost-effective; and, it had to be Eco-friendly. We've gone to extraordinary lengths and overcome a number of challenges to initially create the ICE xPC, then the components - each within a 6-month timeframe.
The biggest challenge we faced in evolving the xPC was the ability to squeeze all of that traditional, large PC technology into a smartphone-size chassis. We had to consider not only the space limitations, but heat dissipation. The latter being a consideration for the components as well. We overcame these issues by increasing the printed circuit board layers to 10 to be able to reside more than four thousands of interconnected tiny circuits, while maintaining a 1mm or less thickness. Our innovative thermal module for heat dissipation of non-fanless processors took care of the heat dissipation issue, separating the heat sink and cooling fan and ensuring proper air flow conduction.
To effectively manage the communication between the ICE xPC and peripherals, we designed an embedded control unit into each along with control software. The control unit and software form a master/slave relationship between the xPC and its peripherals to facilitate performance as a single, integrated PC when connected.
PROTOTYPE
Our first challenge was how to create prototypes of our designs with the limited resources we had. While we considered both ODM (Original Design Manufacturing) and OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturing) for this, the requirements were too restrictive for our small operation and neither could sufficiently fulfill what we envisioned for our products.We made the decision to build the prototypes ourselves. We presented our platform to a leading chip maker. Their team was so excited about our novel and total solution that they immediately gave us access to their latest chip set information and its reference designs. We used this information as the basis for our board and heat dissipation designs. Instead of presenting computer hardware terms only, please allow us to explain development procedures/terms a little bit for easy understanding: 
Industrial design – design look and feel of a new device 
Mechanical design - ensure parts are production-able; design moving parts, such as open/close doors, housing, and connector, etc. 
Schematics, layout/placement – detail engine/cpu and electronic designs 
PCBA, tooling – build and assemble parts, motherboard, and housing 
Firmware – create control software 
Testing – perform engineering, design, and production tests 
We outsourced the Industry Design (ID) to ensure aesthetic appeal and ease of user-interface of the products, and the Mechanical Design for analysis, design, manufacturing, and maintenance of mechanical systems. Our chief hardware architect worked on the xPC's schematics (electronic diagram) and board layout (electronic components placement and connection) designs.With the board layout design completed, we delivered the xPC Gerber file to a contract printed circuit board manufacturer located in Taiwan to produce the circuit boards for us. The Gerber file format is the defacto industry standard for printed circuit board image transfer, and describes the printed circuit board image's copper layers, solder mask, legend, drill holes, etc. Whoever has the Gerber file can manufacture the same product with little effort. However this is not an issue with the xPC, since it is protected by our separated control software and peripherals that make up the xPC.While the circuit boards were being produced, we delivered the Industry and Mechanical designs to a ""soft"" tooling company to make the xPC plastic chassis. Soft tooling is an excellent solution for sample manufacturing as it is low cost and gave us more flexibility in case a design change was needed prior to production. A week later, we had assembled the first xPC prototype!Finally, we needed to be able to test the integration. For this we developed a simple adapter as our testing vehicle. We connected the xPC to this adapter and successfully converted a HDTV into a TVPC! And our simple adapter subsequently became the ICE xAdapter.Our entire xPC platform is now ready to move to production. ICE Computer is consistently delivering on our vision, and continuing to innovate:
2012 Computex - Taipei, Taiwan. Demonstrated the xPC, xAdapter, and xKeyboard. 

2013 Consumer Electronic Show (CES) - Las Vegas, Nevada, US. Six months later, we demonstrated the xPad mobile display with xPC. 

2013 Computex - Taipei, Taiwan. Six months after CES, we demonstrated the 6-in-1 xTop mini desktop prototype. 
2014 Consumer Electronic Show (CES) - Las Vegas, Nevada, US. If you are attending the CES, we cordially invite you to visit us from 1/7 to 1/10 at the Monte Carlo Resort, suite # 20001 for a private product introduction.

Since the launch of the xPC, we have successfully delivered new components every 6 months. Our next major focus is on incorporating the latest Intel Atom processors into the xPC to deliver higher CPU performance at production.

Open Architecture
When a PC is the size of a smartphone, the possibilities are unlimited! The ICE xPC open connector architecture facilitates the use of existing peripherals and provides developers with the opportunity to create peripherals or accessories as needed. 
For example, you could select a low cost gaming “shell” or “docking” device in your favorite color, display size, and with control buttons “only”, and simply plug the ICE xPC™ core processor into the gaming device to play your games.  This gives you the power of the ICE xPC behind the gaming gear that suits you.
At ICE Computer, our fundamental philosophy is to create core technologies and development kits to assist developers in joining the computing revolution. We want to empower developers to become computing innovators and support new business ventures. 
Detailed SDK specs will be available soon on our ICE Dev Blog.

Current Challenges & Risk
People have been discussing modular computers for decades. However, very few companies (including the ‘big brand’ shops) have actually introduced a truly modular computer. To date, modular systems have had significant limitations or obstacles, including:

Design limitations of the motherboard when it is broken down into several interconnected boards
Components that are confined inside the same chassis
Component feature flaws
The ‘modular’ PCs available today are typically difficult to upgrade, a flaw some attribute to marketing schemes which require users to re-purchase new models every few years in order to stay current with technology. 
ENGINEERING 
Since very few manufacturers offer modular computers, it requires computer savvy and knowledge to identify proper sections that allow easy interchange and facilitate upgrades. Unlike traditional “in-chassis” approaches, we have successfully identified and separated key functional components into modules, each with their own small chassis.  
This approach will allow consumers to be more closely aligned with new technologies, and makes purchasing new, advanced components more cost-effective. 
MANUFACTURING 
ICE Computer has high confidence in our demonstrated and tested technology. The challenge we currently face is funding to enable mass production.
In preparation for manufacturing, we have:  

Engineered our platform of products for mass-manufacturing
Built and tested the pre-production units 
Applied for, and passed, government regulations on pre-production units
Partnered with a select manufacturer in Taiwan or China in preparation for mass production
Identified distribution partners for packaging and shipping
With only a handful of PC manufacturers globally, 60% of the world's notebook PCs and the majority of PC components for desktops are manufactured in Taiwan. Therefore, we have established a team in Taiwan to work directly with the manufacturers. This team will oversee operations and assist with mitigating any risk. 
Our Atom xPC production plan is as follows:

<p>High-end systems require high-end cooling. While many of us like

and its components. In addition, the GPU and Motherboard are on opposite sides,
ensuring there can be no over-heating between components. The connection
between them is achieved via high quality PCI-E x16 shielded riser cables

Our

hundreds of hours of designing to achieve this result, which allows you to
showcase the heart of your computer and make sure it always stays cool by
taking fresh air from outside and not having to endure the restrictive
conditions inside most cases.<br/>Except for 2 parts of the frame, all of the case can be taken apart with a simple hex key we'll provide, including the motherboard plate.<br/>There are no ""slide and lock"" parts, so if you  want to make a customized top, side or front panel etc, they will all require just 4 screws to be kept in place.<br/><p></p><p><br/></p><p><b>Funding Distribution</b><br/><b>Note</b> -<b> the final retail price will be between 150 and 200 euros;</b><br/><br/><b>1200 €</b>          x3 Defcon One prototypes<br/><br/>Detailed cost of single prototype<b>:</b><br/>- 95 €           Laser cut<br/>- 75 €           Sheet-metal bending<br/>- 15 €            Screw-thread rivets+screws<br/>- 50 €           Cables (x2 shielded PCI-Ex16, SLI sample cable, 3.0 USB, PWR button) <br/>- 75 €            Plexiglass+cutouts, custom aluminum standoffs, orgings.<br/>- 60 €            Fire-painting<br/>- 30 €            Sample package </p><p><b>750  €</b>           Components to use inside the test prototype<br/><b>400  €</b>           Shipping costs and addtional testing gear<br/><b>150  €</b>           Insurance+Indiegogo fees.<br/><br/></p>

<p><strong>Q: How can I get a Defcon One case by Hydra?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> By contributing to the upcoming production
campaign – the current campaign is just to help us produce the prototype, and
we’ll be opening pre-orders with the following production campaign.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Q: Do I have to sign up for early shipment to
pre-order one?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>No,
you don’t have to – you’ll be able to pre-order the Defcon One case during the
production campaign, but those who bid the early shipment will receive the case
sooner. This of course applies if you buy a case during the production campaign
and the campaign is successful.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Q: When will the Defcon One be ready for shipping?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>We
can’t set a definitive date at the moment (this is one of the things the
prototype campaign is for, evaluating  production time), but tentatively
we’d say around October.<br/>
Do keep in mind that this is all best-case-scenario and time frames might
change slightly.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>
<p><strong>Q: When will the production campaign launch?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong><span>
If all goes well, the production campaign will launch in a month or two after
the prototype one has ended. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Q: How much will be the contribution for the Defcon
One case during the production campaing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>We
expect the price to be between 150 and 200 euros + shipping fees</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Q: Where can you ship?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> At the moment we can ship to Europe and North America,
but are taking measures to get worldwide shipping up for the production
campaing.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will I be able to buy the Defcon One elsewhere?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>Yes,
the Defcon One will be made available on our website after the production
campaign is over. By contributing to the campaign you will have access to a lower price than retail customers.<br/>
 </p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I preorder the Defcon One?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>Yes,
you’ll be able to pre-order yours ahead of anyone else during the production
campaing.<br/><br/><b>Q: What happened to the first crowdfunding?</b><br/><br/><b>A: </b>The first campaign helped us create the mark II prototypes and got a lot of people and stores interested in the project - we then implemented all of the feedback from the various forums, articles and social networks to re-design the case and present this new version.</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility related Questions</strong></p>
<p><br/>
<strong><span>Q: What motherboards does the Defcon One support?</span></strong><br/>
<br/>
<strong>A:</strong>We
designed the Defcon One around a Micro-ATX (244x244mm) motherboard. Smaller
motherboards are also supported such as Mini-ITX<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Q: How many and what kinds of GPUs can I use?</strong><br/>
<br/>
<strong>A:</strong>The
Defcon One is designed to fit all of the nVidia dual slot reference design
cards, and any card up to 300 in length (cards up to 320 mm may fit, but that
depends on the power connector placement) and 112 mm in height.<br/>
In Single GPU configuration there is no height limitation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Q: What kind of coolers can I use?</strong><br/>
<br/>
<strong>A:</strong> We
designed the Defcon One to fit closed loop liquid coolers such as the H80i or
the Seidon 120V – any 120mm radiator/fan setup should fit without any problems.<br/>
Air colling is supported for low profile coolers (up to 85mm in height) with
the use of a 120mm fan instead of the radiator assembly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Q: Can I make a custom loop?</strong><br/>
<br/>
<strong>A:</strong>yes,
as long as you use a 120mm radiator there should be enough space to create a
custom loop – we’ll test that more extensively with the prototype.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Q: What kind of Power Supply can I use?</strong><br/>
<br/>
<strong>A:</strong>  ATX
Power Supplies up to 150mm are supported, both modular and non modular.</p><p>
<br/>
<strong><span>Q: What is the Defcon One made of?</span></strong><br/>
<br/>
<strong>A:</strong>The
structure is fully in 1.5mm, heat painted aluminum and the windows have
plexiglass on them for transparency.</p>
<br/>
<strong><span>Q: Who will manufacture it?</span></strong><br/>
<br/>
<strong>A: </strong>Every
part of manufacturing will be made in Italy by local companies, from laser
cutting (provided by a partner company), to sheet metal-fabrication and assembly, which we will do ourselves.<div> The paint-job will be scratch-proof and done by a specialized company.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Q: What accessories does it come with?</strong><br/>
<br/>
<strong>A:</strong>We
will provide a shielded PCI-E x16 cable and a SLI cable, along with the USB 3.0
ports and the Hex key to open it.<br/><br/><strong>Q: I got a Defcon One during your previous crowdfunding, is that still on?</strong><br/><br/><strong>A: </strong>Yes, definitely! those of you who got a reservation for a Defcon One during our first campaign will get an email during our production campaign and receive the Defcon One as soon as it's ready!<br/>

hundreds of hours of designing to achieve this result, which allows you to
showcase the heart of your computer and make sure it always stays cool by
taking fresh air from outside and not having to endure the restrictive
conditions inside most cases.Except for 2 parts of the frame, all of the case can be taken apart with a simple hex key we'll provide, including the motherboard plate.There are no ""slide and lock"" parts, so if you  want to make a customized top, side or front panel etc, they will all require just 4 screws to be kept in place.Funding DistributionNote - the final retail price will be between 150 and 200 euros;1200 €          x3 Defcon One prototypesDetailed cost of single prototype:- 95 €           Laser cut- 75 €           Sheet-metal bending- 15 €            Screw-thread rivets+screws- 50 €           Cables (x2 shielded PCI-Ex16, SLI sample cable, 3.0 USB, PWR button) - 75 €            Plexiglass+cutouts, custom aluminum standoffs, orgings.- 60 €            Fire-painting- 30 €            Sample package 750  €           Components to use inside the test prototype400  €           Shipping costs and addtional testing gear150  €           Insurance+Indiegogo fees.

Yes, this is how easy it is to take it apart - only the 2 L shaped parts will be fixed, all the rest can be taken off for modding purposes!FAQ
Q: How can I get a Defcon One case by Hydra?
A: By contributing to the upcoming production
campaign – the current campaign is just to help us produce the prototype, and
we’ll be opening pre-orders with the following production campaign.

Q: Do I have to sign up for early shipment to
pre-order one?
A:No,
you don’t have to – you’ll be able to pre-order the Defcon One case during the
production campaign, but those who bid the early shipment will receive the case
sooner. This of course applies if you buy a case during the production campaign
and the campaign is successful.

Q: When will the Defcon One be ready for shipping?
A:We
can’t set a definitive date at the moment (this is one of the things the
prototype campaign is for, evaluating  production time), but tentatively
we’d say around October.
Do keep in mind that this is all best-case-scenario and time frames might
change slightly. 
Q: When will the production campaign launch?
A:
If all goes well, the production campaign will launch in a month or two after
the prototype one has ended. 

Q: How much will be the contribution for the Defcon
One case during the production campaing?
A:We
expect the price to be between 150 and 200 euros + shipping fees

Q: Where can you ship?
A: At the moment we can ship to Europe and North America,
but are taking measures to get worldwide shipping up for the production
campaing.
Q: Will I be able to buy the Defcon One elsewhere?
A:Yes,
the Defcon One will be made available on our website after the production
campaign is over. By contributing to the campaign you will have access to a lower price than retail customers.
 
Q: Can I preorder the Defcon One?
A:Yes,
you’ll be able to pre-order yours ahead of anyone else during the production
campaing.Q: What happened to the first crowdfunding?A: The first campaign helped us create the mark II prototypes and got a lot of people and stores interested in the project - we then implemented all of the feedback from the various forums, articles and social networks to re-design the case and present this new version.
Compatibility related Questions

Q: What motherboards does the Defcon One support?

A:We
designed the Defcon One around a Micro-ATX (244x244mm) motherboard. Smaller
motherboards are also supported such as Mini-ITX

Q: How many and what kinds of GPUs can I use?

A:The
Defcon One is designed to fit all of the nVidia dual slot reference design
cards, and any card up to 300 in length (cards up to 320 mm may fit, but that
depends on the power connector placement) and 112 mm in height.
In Single GPU configuration there is no height limitation.


Q: What kind of coolers can I use?

A: We
designed the Defcon One to fit closed loop liquid coolers such as the H80i or
the Seidon 120V – any 120mm radiator/fan setup should fit without any problems.
Air colling is supported for low profile coolers (up to 85mm in height) with
the use of a 120mm fan instead of the radiator assembly.


Q: Can I make a custom loop?

A:yes,
as long as you use a 120mm radiator there should be enough space to create a
custom loop – we’ll test that more extensively with the prototype.


Q: What kind of Power Supply can I use?

A:  ATX
Power Supplies up to 150mm are supported, both modular and non modular.

Q: What is the Defcon One made of?

A:The
structure is fully in 1.5mm, heat painted aluminum and the windows have
plexiglass on them for transparency.

Q: Who will manufacture it?

A: Every
part of manufacturing will be made in Italy by local companies, from laser
cutting (provided by a partner company), to sheet metal-fabrication and assembly, which we will do ourselves. The paint-job will be scratch-proof and done by a specialized company.

Q: What accessories does it come with?

A:We
will provide a shielded PCI-E x16 cable and a SLI cable, along with the USB 3.0
ports and the Hex key to open it.Q: I got a Defcon One during your previous crowdfunding, is that still on?A: Yes, definitely! those of you who got a reservation for a Defcon One during our first campaign will get an email during our production campaign and receive the Defcon One as soon as it's ready!",27.0,0,"4 Campaigns

</b></p>
<p><b>What were the challenges of the original campaign and why did shipping take so long?</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Our company, Trident Design, is used to developing amazing products, but this concept was especially challenging. We went beyond designing a patent pending airframe and propellers. We developed our own custom camera, Bluetooth control module and composite material!  Our first setback was a circuit board design that could not handle a power spike caused by our motors. Then as we ordered our redesigned circuit board, our factory had a backorder of a critical component. Both these events pushed back our delivery by several months. Our current schedule should have us shipping the first units to our original backers in January.</span></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p><b>
</b></p>
<p><b>Is this for real? How durable is it really?</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Yes, this is for real. To our knowledge, no other plane even comes close to our durability under normal use. No product is indestructible and the Carbon Flyer is no exception. However, under normal flying conditions, the hard landings that would normally shatter a foam plane should not typically damage a Carbon Flyer. In hundreds of test flights and crashes over the last year and a half we have pushed this plane to the limit and beyond.</span></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p><b>
</b></p>
<p><b>Does the Carbon Flyer's have any weak points?</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The number one enemy of any RC plane is a tree or rooftop. While it can survive most crashes, landing on a roof is never good. Always fly in an appropriate open area away from obstacles. Stepping or sitting on a Carbon Flyer can certainly damage it.</span></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p><b>
</b></p>
<p><b>How easy is it to fly?</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Carbon Flyer is simple to fly, much more so than traditional RC planes, but it still takes good technique. You should use a straight, smooth, upward toss to launch the plane. Just tilt your phone to steer Carbon Flyer left and right and slide the throttle to control altitude.</span></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p><b>
</b></p>
<p><b>How well does it handle the wind or rain?</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Carbon Flyer can handle heavier winds than most small foam planes, but it is still a very small aircraft. Winds over 5 mph can really challenge it, and anything over 10 mph is not recommended. The electronics are not sealed so avoid flying near water or hard rain.</span></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p><b>
</b></p>
<p><b>How is Carbon Flyer made?</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Each Carbon Flyer body is made one at a time in a very laborious, process that requires advanced craftsmanship. The Carbon Flyer's body is made from a single ply of a proprietary thermo-formed carbon fiber cloth. First, it is placed in a mold and pressed into shape. Then the mold is placed in an oven for several hours to cure. The parts are then trimmed in a CNC machine and glued together with special epoxy. The resulting plane body is tested for dimensional accuracy and all the electronics are attached and tested.</span></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p><b>
</b></p>
<p><b>Can Carbon Flyer work with my R/C radio?</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">While it is possible to modify the Carbon Flyer to work with a radio it would take someone familiar with hobby aircraft to do the job. Our lead designer, Bret, plans to execute such a modification and record the process on YouTube to share it. We may offer this mod ourselves in the future.</span></p>

Every Carbon Flyer backer will receive a pdf printout that can be used as a gift placeholder!




















AEROPLATEtm CARBON FIBER MATERIAL



Like a Samurai sword, our unique Aeroplatetm carbon fiber is both incredibly strong yet flexible. It absorbs most impacts without breaking and springs back into its molded shape. The Carbon Flyer’s entire airframe is made of this material. Aeroplatetm consists of thin, strong, crystalline filaments composed of nearly pure carbon. It is over 1,000 times stronger than the foam used in most RC planes.


Foam wings easily tear and snap and paper can’t hold a consistent shape.



   



HIGH DEFINITION ONBOARD CAMERA

The Carbon Flyer features an available onboard HD (high definition) video camera to capture amazing aerial footage to share with your friends. Don’t be fooled by products with low quality cameras. We also offer a 640x480 standard definition (SD) camera. For safety, controllability, and efficiency, flight video is recorded for viewing rather than streamed to your phone.

Then the mold is placed in an oven for several hours to cure. The parts are then trimmed in a CNC machine and glued together with special epoxy. The resulting plane body is tested for dimensional accuracy and all the electronics are attached and tested.



Can Carbon Flyer work with my R/C radio?
While it is possible to modify the Carbon Flyer to work with a radio it would take someone familiar with hobby aircraft to do the job. Our lead designer, Bret, plans to execute such a modification and record the process on YouTube to share it. We may offer this mod ourselves in the future.",33.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>SoundFest is the brainchild of co-founders Mark Eisner and David Duehren, two experienced engineers who like to solve communication problems for a living. Mark began developing the company's flagship product three years ago, when he started losing some of his own hearing, and discovered he was spending hours at specialists' offices, and spending thousands of dollars on hearing aids of limited quality.</p>
<p>Why shouldn't hearing better be simpler, he thought, and no more complicated than getting a pair of glasses to correct your vision?</p>
<p>Mark recognized the untapped power of smartphones to help solve this global public health problem. Poor hearing not only compromises people's professsional and social well-being, it is associated with serious health risks, like depression and dementia, as you age. So Mark decided to develop Real Clarity to deliver low-cost hearing assistance via smartphone. Turns out the timing couldn't be better: the fastest growing segment of smartphone market happens to be aging baby-boomers. Many of them are beginning to experience the onset of age-related hearing loss. So Real Clarity is well-positioned to be the right product at the right time in the market.</p>
<p>Thanks to patent-pending technology developed by Mark and David, SoundFest will soon offer sleekly designed wireless earpieces with its Real Clarity App. These discreet Bluetooth-like earpieces will allow Real Clarity users wireless connectivity  and hearing assistance whenever and wherever they need it. Without delays. Without extra devices. Without staggering bills.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional hearing aids, which often cost 10 or 20 times more, Real Clarity's App and wireless earpiece will retail for less than $200.</p>

The most efficient way to get referrals would be to share one of our photos that you like, explain why you supported our campaign, and then add your referral link.  Do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions on our referral program!Certain USB devices, such as a printer or a hard drive, may always stay connected to your iMac. They can therefore be plugged into the rear ports of the iMac and left there without a problem. However, when you want to add files from your USB thumb, transfer photos, or other day to day uses for a USB port - accessing them in the back can be a hassle! The iMacompanion solves that problem by giving you access to a front USB port while preserving the beautiful design of the iMac. The iMacompanion is a USB 3.0 extension made out of sandblasted and anodized aluminum to seamlessly integrate itself at the foot of the iMac. Thanks to the ultra-slim cable (0.01 inch/0.25 mm) that passes under the foot of the iMac, it will keep your desktop cable free.To install, simply remove the protective layer of the PU (polyurethane) below the iMacompanion, stick it on the tip of the foot, and pass the cable under the iMac. The cable will be completely invisible from the front. Thanks to its unique design, the iMacompanion is fully compatible with all iMacs ranging from 2004 until Today! It also works with both the 21.5 inch and the 27 inch versions and it is very likely that it will be compatible with future iMacs. The iMacompanion is also compatible with Apple's Cinema Display screens and other brands of screens with hard to reach USB ports in the back. Please check measurements carefully before pledging.The iMacompanion is a USB 3.0 extension made out of sandblasted and anodized aluminum just like Apple's own iMac.

*Performance may vary from one drive to another.The PU below the iMacompanion can be re-used several times should you need to change iMacs (though we recommend not to treat it as a mobile port).The iMacompanion is an accessory every iMac owner should have. It's also a unique gift for people who love their iMacs!Click here to go to our press kit.Here are all the steps that we have completed so far in the creation process of the iMacompanion:To continue we need your support and funding. We have already gathered the funds to produce a USB 2.0 iMacompanion but the market has really told us that USB 3.0 is the way to go! Therefore we have to create specific molds for the USB 3.0 connectors and we need your help to order them as they are expensive! Here is the timeline from the project onwards:Launching the iDockAll last year has taught us precisely how to successfully completed a campaign, and we know how challenging it can be. Our priority is, and has always been, to make sure our backers are happy with their purchase and the service they have received. We are very proud to say that in the vast majority of cases, we have succeeded! We intend to do even better in this campaign.We are now 100% ready. All processes have been carefully tested, allowing us to establish confirmed lead times of manufacturing. We are confident to say that we will be able to ship within five months of the project's funding.Please let us know if you have any questions or comments, we would love to hear from you.And of course, feel free to share this project with anyone who loves their iMacs.Thank you warmly for your support,Nathalie and KevinFor more updates you can also follow us on Facebook andTwitter !Apple and the iMac image are trademarks of Apple Inc.,No endorsement implied.",21.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p></p>
<div><div>
<p>The legal technology industry is growing rapidly. Just last year, law firms in the U.S. earned $266 billion in revenue, but with more and more clients becoming computer-savvy and depending on the use of modern technology, the traditional law firm model is breaking. Clients are demanding affordable legal advice on demand and most law firms aren't equipped to provide it. Quicklegal is designed to be fast, efficient and easy to use for both the consumer and the attorney. When something happens or a question arises, many consumers wish they had an attorney to chat with for few minutes to ease their concern and help them contemplate the next step. Attorneys, who are often looking for ways to service more clients and bring in new streams of income, need a way to assist these consumers - but not at the risk of nonpayment or unnecessary liability risks. </p>
<p>By decreasing time commitments, processing payments in advance, and providing a secure, online venue for attorneys to chat with clients face-to-face, Quicklegal is the solution. Now, attorneys who have gaps in their schedule or just wish to use the service throughout the day to earn income and personally control their marketing, can make themselves available online to help consumers at the moment they need legal counsel.</p>

<h3>BETTER THAN THE USUAL SUSPECTS</h3>
<div>
<p>- <b>No extra hardware</b>: Seizario is a
        mobile app that runs directly on your smartphone. Unlike other
        products, you do not have to wear a watch, bracelet, or
        wrist-band to make Seizario work. So no extra hassle of charging
        watches or bracelets and pairing them with your phone, or
        worrying how far away your phone is from your wearable device.
      </p>
<p>- <b>Multiple detection capabilities</b>:
        Seizario is the first (and only) product designed to detect
        falls AND seizures. This covers many more cases of emergency
        than just detecting seizures or just detecting falls.
      </p>
<p>-<b> Affordability</b>: Wearable-based solutions
        cost around $200, and may require monthly subscription,
        resulting in $500+ cost per year. Seizario can be obtained (in early access) for as
        little as $10 through our campaign (with no monthly
        subscription). This makes Seizario 50 times
        more affordable than related products.</p>

<h3>DEVELOPING THE SEIZARIO APP</h3>
<p>To develop Seizario, we have devised two systematic methods for evaluation using internal and external trials. Our team has extensive expertise in this field.</p>
<p>The internal evaluation trials use a test bed including a variety of mobile devices and scenarios. Detailed sensory data are logged and studied. Data analytics are then used on tens of thousands of samples to identify the best settings for our algorithms. Our results thus far have been quite promising. We plan to further expand our coverage with a variety of Android and iPhone devices. In addition, a richer suite of use-cases will be established to enhance the user interface for a better user experience.</p>
<p>For the external trials, we are working with the epilepsy community, a group of early volunteers in the field, and a group of field experts/neurologists to optimize our algorithms to get maximum detection of emergencies (i.e., increased sensitivity) with minimum false positives (i.e., increased specificity). We plan to expand our user base through this campaign to obtain your feedback.</p>

</b></p>
<p><b>
</b></p>
<p><b>EMERGENCIES ARE NOT THE SAME:</b> The Seizario
team is well aware of the variety of emergency cases, and the complexity of
detecting some of them. As with any related product, it may be impossible
to cover 100% of all possible emergency scenarios. Through our internal and
external testing we have been able to cover many common cases of convulsions
(mainly in generalized tonic clonic seizures) and falls. With your involvement,
Seizario shall improve and learn to adapt to different patterns.</p>
<p><b>DEVICES ARE NOT THE SAME: </b>Delivering excellent performance on a variety of smartphones provides
a challenge. Our algorithms are efficient and effective, they adjust to
various sensors, and self-calibrate with different sensitivities, achieving
very good performance in our tests so far. With your support and participation

Seizario is a mobile app that helps detect falls and seizure convulsions, and informs emergency contacts in a timely manner so help can be provided. It is the brain-child of Amir, a 13-year old innovator, who developed it with the help of his dad (computer science professor). Seizario can be directly downloaded on your smartphone, without any additional hardware.
THE NEED FOR SEIZARIO (In Numbers)

Over 65 million people worldwide (3 million in the US) suffer from epilepsy, with repeated seizures (many involving severe convulsions and falls) that can lead to injury or death if not treated in a timely manner. 
Falls of seniors lead to over 2.4 million serious injuries a year in the US, and many more worldwide.

About us : 

O'SUN is a company that designs a smart range of portable solar lamps that are made to be used by anyone in the world by focusing on answering the need of those who live without access to electricity. 
Our first product ""NOMAD"" launched in 2013 have already changed lives of thousands of people's around the world and have been awarded in many countries.




How Pocketlight is Born : 

In June 2014 we decided to developed a second lamp under the concept of ""One lamp-One Individual"" .                                                   
To design Pocketlight we took the decision to contact several schools and designers based in countries where there is a huge need of electricity and thus give the opportunity to one of them to collaborate with us.
We received several concepts but one really stood out and met our needs, this concept was the one proposed by Parin Sanghvi a 22 year old under graduate student (at that time) from MIT institute of design in India. 


India happens to be the most deprived country as far as provision of energy is concerned. 306 million people in the country are still living without benefiting from this basic utility.
Parin , is now a graduate since April 2015 and we are proud to make his dream happen and see his finished design getting manufactured.
The Belgian agency IOL Strategic Design specializing in design and product development for the past 17 years carried out all the art Pocketlight modeling in accordance with Parin Sanghvi's design , standards and electronic constraints. The agency has helped to make the connection between design and technology by offering us a functional solution.

Pocketlight & the project
We are happy to introduce Pocketlight our new, affordable, multi-situation and compact solar lamp specially designed for an individual. The multiple functions work instinctively, enhancing the experience and allowing tasks to be completed efficiently.The ""Pocketability"" and simplicity of use makes it a useful task light in any situation. It provides more than 30 hours of LED light, ideal for disaster emergency situations, camping, hiking or simply has a reading lamp.
In developing countries Pocketlight will have these positive impact :



 It will improve children's life by giving them the opportunity to study during evening hours and thus extend the light time by minimum 4 hours a day.


The amount of toxic fumes from the kerosene lamp will be reduced, that represent for woman and children in a shelter or hut the equivalent of 2 packs of cigarettes a day.CO2 emissions will be reduce of about 100-150 kg per year


Reduced fire hazard indoors

Increased safety of the user against assaults,rape.
Through our community projects,support young and local woman entrepreneurs by giving them the opportunity to develop their own ""solar shop"" that will create jobs and income.

Be part of the "" Buy one - Give one "" campaign as Pocketlight will start to be distribute in October 2015 to you and to our community projects. 
Pocketlight is the lamp to bring with you for your outdoors activity, trip or in your car. Now you can pre-order at a price of $40 for one Pocketlight and you will proudly donate the same lamp to someone in need in developing countries.

<div><b>What will I get? </b></div>
<p>With any perk, you will receive the my E-book and and other best seller E-book for free in which I explain how to make apps from scratch.<br/></p>
<p><strong>I've changed my mind. Can I get a refund?</strong><br/>Sorry, Indiegogo's policy is No Refunds. Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do about this. When your contribution is deposited into our PayPal account, it comes from Indiegogo, not from you. So if we were to refund your contribution, it wouldn't make it back to you. <a href=""https://go.indiegogo.com/playbook/contributing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Please see Indiegogo's rules here</a>.</p>
<p><strong style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Can I get multiple perks?</strong><br/></p>
<p>Yes! You can back our campaign as many times as you want, choosing as many perks as you want.</p>
<p><strong>Can I change my perk?</strong><br/>Unfortunately, not during the campaign. But before we send you your gear, we'll send you an email with a link to a system that will help you manage your perk, input your shipping information, and purchase add-ons if you choose.</p>
<p><strong>When you ship, will you please declare a lesser value on the customs form?</strong><br/>No.</p>
<p><strong> What are the shipping costs?</strong><br/></p>
<p>All shipping in the US is free of charge. There is additional cost for international shipping. Shipment does not include extra fees from customs, or additional costs associated with your country. Also, there is no guarantee that this will work in your country (e.g. unknown power &amp; connectivity issues) – there are many hurdles we need to go over until we have a complete picture on the international market. If it turns out that shipment to your country proves impossible, we will reimburse your order.<br/></p>

What will I get? 
With any perk, you will receive the my E-book and and other best seller E-book for free in which I explain how to make apps from scratch.
I've changed my mind. Can I get a refund?Sorry, Indiegogo's policy is No Refunds. Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do about this. When your contribution is deposited into our PayPal account, it comes from Indiegogo, not from you. So if we were to refund your contribution, it wouldn't make it back to you. Please see Indiegogo's rules here.
Can I get multiple perks?
Yes! You can back our campaign as many times as you want, choosing as many perks as you want.
Can I change my perk?Unfortunately, not during the campaign. But before we send you your gear, we'll send you an email with a link to a system that will help you manage your perk, input your shipping information, and purchase add-ons if you choose.
When you ship, will you please declare a lesser value on the customs form?No.
 What are the shipping costs?
All shipping in the US is free of charge. There is additional cost for international shipping. Shipment does not include extra fees from customs, or additional costs associated with your country. Also, there is no guarantee that this will work in your country (e.g. unknown power & connectivity issues) – there are many hurdles we need to go over until we have a complete picture on the international market. If it turns out that shipment to your country proves impossible, we will reimburse your order.

I hope that you are just as excited as I am about this project and becoming a backer right now. THANK YOU for supporting this project, I can't wait to show you what you can learn from this eBook.",13.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<h3><strong>About Us</strong></h3>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p align=""LEFT""><em>Rimtech, will manufacture and market a protective device for consumers to</em> use<em> on</em></p>
<p align=""LEFT""><em>their motor vehicles. The trade name ""Spartan"" will serve as brand name and</em></p>
<p align=""LEFT""><em>identity name for the product. The product is intended as a way to protect the rim</em></p>
<p align=""LEFT""><em>and hubcap while the tire is being treated with Armor All , Turtle Wax or Tire</em></p>
<p align=""LEFT""><em>Foam to name a few. The user would simply place the device over the rim and</em></p>
<p align=""LEFT""><em>proceed to treat the tire. Any errant sprays or drifting mist would land on the cover</em></p>
<p align=""LEFT""><em>rather than on the rim or hubcap. This would eliminate the need to wipe the rim</em></p>
<p align=""LEFT""><em>afterwards. The process could then be repeated with the other tires. This</em></p>
<p align=""LEFT""><em>elimination of a step during the car washing process would save the user time and</em></p>
<p><em>effort and would ensure that no chemicals are left on the wheel.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Advantages Of the Product </strong></p>
<p>The appealing features of “SPARTAN” would be its ease of application, the reduced amount of wheel cleaning required, and the protection provided for the wheels. No longer would the car owner have to wipe the rim and hubcap after spraying or cleaning the tire. Instead, he could simply place the cover over the rim while applying chemicals to the tire. The cover would prevent the chemicals or soap from accumulating in the many crevices and opening of the expensive rims and would prevent long –term chemical buildup. When uncovered, the wheels would look like new, and the owner would be proud to show them off. The “SPARTAN” would save the vehicle owner a great deal of time and effort since he would not have to clean the wheels after coating the tires. This product would be lightweight and durable for years of effective use. It would also be inexpensive and could be easily stored on a shelf or in the trunk when not in use. This product could appeal to private car owners as well as owners of car wash facilities and auto detailing businesses as a way to increase productivity.</p>

<h3>The Deal About the Owner</h3>
<p> Here is my story.  I am currently serving in the U.S. Army and have been for fifteen years.  I am married to the woman of my dreams for the past 13 and as a result of that I have had the privilege and honor to help raise my beautiful 10, 8, 5, and 3 year olds!  Life doesn’t get much better when you realize you are the luckiest man on the planet as I get to be supported every moment of my day with them!  Thank you to you, you really are awesome!</p>
<p>My product has come this far with the help of my family and amazing friends; including some awesome mentors along the way.  One of which is a professor from the (TSBDC) Tennessee Small Business Development Center whom has gone way above his call of duty and offered priceless guidance, knowledge,  and know how as I now have entered the business world.</p>
<p>With his help, it has brought me to you.</p>
<p>My goal is to give to the market what is missing.  My product alone offers that!  A way to clean your rims the right way!  We take so much pride in the things we love, here is a way to ensure a deeper level of satisfaction in the work we offer!  This alone sells my product!  Something we need, so something we Get!</p>
<p>More importantly then fulfilling our need is also fulfilling ourselves.  My story documents my time in Iraq and Afghanistan.  There I saw things that many don’t.  We do the job and in return we retire from the military only to receive our retirement check that barely covers the bills and/or we enter life again missing an arm or a leg.  This is not to tell you that I am looking for pity, instead to remind all of you that the end result should never be a retirement check, it should be to look deeper into ourselves, always knowing what better to offer.  To do what you do today, but to also believe in that interest of yours, to know it’s true value and to let it out!  We all need it, yes we need the physical need it offers, but more importantly it reminds us to be the best parts of ourselves, and that is what the world needs!  It needs us to know our value and to show others to see theirs!</p>
<p>Continuing for a moment with my time line let me tell you another significant moment for me.   A year back, I received an offer to take my idea off my hands by a large multi-million dollar company, but I turned it down.  I was told it would be too much for me to handle.  Here is what I think about that.  My years in the military have taught me several things; one is that ‘We never quit, if I can look Death in the face and return to my family, I CAN DO ANYTHING!  And anything also includes taking my heart and soul and sharing it to the world!  It is not too much to handle to know who I am.  And it is my goal for you to never forger who you are.</p>
<p>My story has brought me to you today.  I am without words as I attempt to explain what you really mean to me.  You give me courage to tell you this.  I may not know you, but your approval is what drives me.  I am offering you to see you through me.  And to never give up! </p>
<p>So  please take advantage of my product as in itself it serves a need not yet met, and please continue to know who you are and have the courage to share it with the rest of us!</p>

<p>The problem is that this connection takes place mostly in front of the computer, so even though we're connecting, it feels like we've become more disconnected from <strong>each other.</strong> </p>
<p>Enter Tryper.</p>
<p>Tryper is a social network, similar in many ways to others, such as Facebook and Google+, in that it will enable you to easily find your friends, communicate with them, make new ones, or reconnect with old ones. But unlike other sites…</p>
<p>Our goal is to make you <strong>leave</strong> your screen; whether to get together with your friends more often, to meet new people with similar interests, or to expand your circle of friends.</p>
<p>We've designed tools that will make it incredibly easy for you to meet in <strong>real life</strong>, face to face, to do pretty much anything you could possibly think of or want to do (or even things you've never thought of doing!), whether to play sports, go skydiving, go to a museum, go shopping, or simply have a drink with a few friends!</p>
<p>Similarly, when it comes to traveling; whether it's your first time and you've never left the city you live in, and you don't even know where to begin, or if you're an experienced traveller who has already seen the world... whether you want to go backpacking across Europe to meet new people, to go and relax on the beaches of Mexico, or even to have the next big adventure of your life with a couple of your closest friends...</p>
<p>Tryper will make this quick to do and simple to manage.</p>
<p>Now, Tryper is not in its beginning phase – In fact, with Indiegogo's help, we would be ready to launch shortly after our Indiegogo campaign comes to an end.</p>
<p>A year and a half has gone into designing and developing Tryper, and our team has gone from 4 people to 9 people in the past 5 months, and includes more than 60 years of experience, with backgrounds in:</p>

<li>Software Testing</li>
<li>Technical Writing</li>
<li>and Project Management</li>
</ul><p>Lastly, it's important to mention 2 more things: Privacy and Ownership of Information. </p>
<p>1) Privacy: This is extremely important to us and we have put extensive work and planning into making sure that your privacy is kept safe. From giving you settings that will enable you to control your information, such that only your friends can see it, to preventing search engines from finding your profile in a search, we take privacy <strong>very</strong> seriously and we intend on ensuring that it doesn't get violated.</p>

If you decide to leave Tryper and you delete your account, your information will get removed, deleted, erased. It is yours and this means it is yours to come and go with, as you please.</p>
<p>Now, we managed to get this far on our own, but we need your help to get it out to the world.</p>

a deal on the tooling and mold costs compared to what it was going to cost us
directly from a factory already certified by Apple Inc. The anticipated
approval date is still unknown and we want to launch this product sooner rather
than later. This is why we are Crowdfunding. We decided to go direct to an
Apple Inc. certified factory to finalize the retail product instead of waiting
out the certification to come through for our R&amp;D Factory. </p>
<p>This decision added unexpected costs,
but we felt it best not to wait another 2-3 months beyond the point at which
this particular factory is at with the Apple® process. The disadvantage for us
has led to creating an advantage for Crowdfunders. </p>

</p><p>The day started off at 6 am
volunteering at Naples largest event of the year to raise money for a local

venerated teachers when they become a Zen Master. 
Roshi is a minimalist's best friend for
the ultimate backup battery solution without having to lug around cords, backup
battery ""bricks"" or an ugly backup battery case. 
Roshi is a patent pending portable
backup battery device with an A-Grade Lithium Polymer 1,020 mAh battery
enclosed in a sleek case measuring only 3.38 inches wide by 2.2 inches tall by
0.24 inches thick. We designed Roshi to fit in your wallet just like a credit
card and to take up as little space as possible. You only have to know that
it's there when you need it. 


Does this look familiar?

At $19, a three foot long charging
cable is a costly nuisance. Charging on the go shouldn't require lassoing a
meter long cable into your pocket. 
Great ideas start in the mind and are
put to paper by the heart. 

We tested various types of control
boards and batteries out of existing battery packs to see if the design was
even feasible with the space requisites.
The ""Ah-ha"" moment during
sampling led to making our paper rendering illustrated:

While we were dissecting generic packs,
we noticed that most have 3 power indicator lights built into the sides of the
units and realized that our unit MUST integrate an upward facing power light
design with 4 L.E.D.'s, so that it is able to be utilized without being touched
to determine the power level left in the battery pack.

L.E.D.'s:

<p></p>The introduction of technological devices has changed how we approach sports and outdoor activities. Every performance metric can be measured and evaluated with devices like the iPhone and Apple Watch™, making them integral parts of an active life. But unlike traditional sports equipment, these devices need protection. That’s why we’ve made it our mission to guarantee full protection and maximum comfort for every active user.<p></p>

The introduction of technological devices has changed how we approach sports and outdoor activities. Every performance metric can be measured and evaluated with devices like the iPhone and Apple Watch™, making them integral parts of an active life. But unlike traditional sports equipment, these devices need protection. That’s why we’ve made it our mission to guarantee full protection and maximum comfort for every active user.
















ABOUT THE PROJECT:Over the past several months, we have been focused on gathering all the available information about the Apple Watch™. Through a process of reverse engineering, we transformed the photos we found online into a 3D model with a very high level of precision. Then, using a high quality, anallergic rubber material, we designed our first prototypes. The next step before starting production is to finally get our hands on an Apple Watch! We will make sure that our prototypes work perfectly, do some fine tuning if needed, and start production immediately to get THE BUMPER in your hands as fast as possible. With our production partner ready to go, we are prepared to deliver THE BUMPER in May 2015. Support us with your perk and get THE BUMPER before anyone else! Regular sales will start only after we have delivered all Indiegogo orders.We have decided to further your requests! Therefore here you can find some images showing different possible combinations of TheBumper.MOUNTING INSTRUCTIONSMany of you have asked us to show how THE BUMPER will be mounted.

<h3><strong>The Cling On™ Tuner is:</strong></h3>
<p>•        WORLD’S ONLY tuner that can be truly HIDDEN behind the headstock of most guitars, as well as many other fretted instruments.</p>
<p>•        WORLD’S FIRST tuner to tune “Dropped D” string in guitar mode. It will display that as string ""0 D"". Your only other alternative so far was to use a chromatic tuner.</p>
<p>•        WORLD'S MOST VERSATILE tuner that can attach almost ANYWHERE on virtually ANY stringed instrument, as long as the surface is flat.</p>
<p>•        SIX tuners in ONE including chromatic, guitar, ukulele, banjo, cello and bass tuners. Most other tuners have no more than 3 instrument modes.</p>
<p>•        One of the MOST ENERGY-CONSERVING tuners - The Cling On™ Tuner will automatically shut off in 4 minutes.  If the tuner is used for 4 minutes every single day, the battery is expected to last well over 2 years. Most other tuners stay on until they are turned off, or until they do not detect vibration for a certain period of time. But what happens if you forget to turn it off and continue playing? It will stay on and it will drain the battery.</p>
<p>•        One of the MOST ACCURATE tuners - Behind the small size of the device is hiding a machine that provides over 99% accuracy and an almost instant readout (under 20ms response time).</p>
<p>•        One of the MOST ELLEGANT tuners - During the design process a lot of attention was paid not only to its functionality, but also to the visual aesthetics of the tuner itself. No cheap plastics will be used, so not only will it look great, but it will also feel great in your hands.</p>
<p>•        DEDICATED BUTTONS - No multi-function button to confuse you.  The Cling On™ Tuner will use dedicated buttons that will make it very clear and easy for anyone to jiggle through the many features without any confusion.</p>
<p>• One of the MOST COMPACT tuners with one of the LARGEST LCD DISPLAYS. This large color backlit LCD display (35mm/1.38”diagonally) is very easy to read from a distance even in the darkest dungeon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <strong><em>Dimensions of the Cling On Tuner:</em></strong></p>
<p><img alt=""Dimensions of the Cling On Tuner"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/617707/pictures/full/20130114190401-group2.jpg?1358219048"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>How and where can the tuner be attached to the instrument?</strong></h3>
<p>The mount uses the force of suction. With a simple twist it clings to the surface with a hold so strong, that it can lift up most stringed instruments. This tight connection also allows for the vibration of the instrument to be easily transferred on to the tuner, providing the sensitivity and accuracy needed. With only 36mm (1.42 inches) in diameter this little mount can be placed almost anywhere on the instrument as long as the surface is flat and non-porous. If the surface is porous then you have the option to use one of the nearly invisible clear round stickers that will be included with the tuner. They will provide the necessary non-porous surface for the mount to cling on to the instrument. Most guitars for example have a high gloss finish, or painted surface, so that provides the adequate surface for the mount to cling on, WITHOUT the stickers.</p>

<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>
<strong>Who needs the Cling On™ Tuner</strong>?</h3>
<p>Anybody playing a stringed instrument will benefit from having a Cling On™ Tuner. Whether you are a professional musician performing at concerts and gigs, or a teacher, student, or just a guitar aficionado, you have to tune your instrument. The Cling On™ Tuner is making tuning a lot easier and more fun. The popular clip tuner is primarily used by guitarists because it can clip to the headstock. However, that is the only place where this tuner can be attached to. On the contrary, the Cling On™ Tuner gives you the flexibility to attach it ANYWHERE on ANY string instrument as long as there is a flat section on the instrument with the size of the mount (36mm/ 2.41"").</p>
<p> </p>

<h2><strong>.......................................................................................</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Where is the Cling On™ Tuner in the development process?</strong></h3>
<p>It has been a lot of hard work to design and construct all the necessary components, including all plastic parts, printed circuit board, LCD screen and backlight. But I am happy to announce that at the time of starting this campaign most of the work in the design, development and testing have been completed and the results have been outstanding. The Cling On™ Tuner  is currently in pre-production stage, meaning that all components have been designed, constructed and tested. All CAD files are completed and verified, and they are ready for the production process. What you see in the video and the pictures are fully functional prototypes. What's left is to finalize few minor tweaks in the programming, as well as the exact color that would be the closest to what you see in the rendering.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Where is it going to be manufactured?</strong></h3>
<p>I have established a relationship with a highly reputable company in China that specializes in manufacturing digital musical equipment including tuners, so this isn't a new venture for them. From the first sketch to pre-production they have been extremely professional and very attentive to my requests to make the Cling On™ Tuner exactly the way I envisioned it. I am very confident that you would be completely satisfied with the outcome of the first production run of the Cling On™ Tuner.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Why do I need your support?</strong></h3>
<p>There are over 15 different components (not counting nuts and bolts), including over 10 plastic parts that require building tools for the injection molding, as well as several electronic components including the PCB panel, LCD and backlight. At this point, we completed and tested the tools for all plastic components, so they are ready for mass production. Manufacturing the PCB panel and the LCD is very technological and sophisticated process. They are both designed and ready for production. To be able to get to a price point that would make financial sense, these components will have to be produced on a much larger scale. Your support is giving me the financial leverage I need to lower the production cost. </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px; font-weight: normal;""> </span></p>
<h3><strong>Why would you consider supporting this project!</strong></h3>
<p> By contributing to this project you are not only going to get the Cling On Tuner at a great price, but more importantly you are becoming an integral part of this journey. With your support you are essentially helping make this idea become a reality. </p>

It's the FIRST and ONLY tuner that can be truly HIDDEN out of sight, thanks to its INNOVATIVE MOUNTING TECHNOLOGY!

 
 
 
 
.......................................................................................
 
 
TWO MODELS TO CHOOSE FROM:
Classic Titanium Cling On™ Tuner MSRP $39.99

 
Limited Edition Cling On™ Tuner MSRP $42.00

.......................................................................................
 
What is REVOLUTIONARY about the Cling On™ Tuner?
 
The Cling On™ Tuner is:
•        WORLD’S ONLY tuner that can be truly HIDDEN behind the headstock of most guitars, as well as many other fretted instruments.
•        WORLD’S FIRST tuner to tune “Dropped D” string in guitar mode. It will display that as string ""0 D"". Your only other alternative so far was to use a chromatic tuner.
•        WORLD'S MOST VERSATILE tuner that can attach almost ANYWHERE on virtually ANY stringed instrument, as long as the surface is flat.
•        SIX tuners in ONE including chromatic, guitar, ukulele, banjo, cello and bass tuners. Most other tuners have no more than 3 instrument modes.
•        One of the MOST ENERGY-CONSERVING tuners - The Cling On™ Tuner will automatically shut off in 4 minutes.  If the tuner is used for 4 minutes every single day, the battery is expected to last well over 2 years. Most other tuners stay on until they are turned off, or until they do not detect vibration for a certain period of time. But what happens if you forget to turn it off and continue playing? It will stay on and it will drain the battery.
•        One of the MOST ACCURATE tuners - Behind the small size of the device is hiding a machine that provides over 99% accuracy and an almost instant readout (under 20ms response time).
•        One of the MOST ELLEGANT tuners - During the design process a lot of attention was paid not only to its functionality, but also to the visual aesthetics of the tuner itself. No cheap plastics will be used, so not only will it look great, but it will also feel great in your hands.
•        DEDICATED BUTTONS - No multi-function button to confuse you.  The Cling On™ Tuner will use dedicated buttons that will make it very clear and easy for anyone to jiggle through the many features without any confusion.
• One of the MOST COMPACT tuners with one of the LARGEST LCD DISPLAYS. This large color backlit LCD display (35mm/1.38”diagonally) is very easy to read from a distance even in the darkest dungeon.

How and where can the tuner be attached to the instrument?
The mount uses the force of suction. With a simple twist it clings to the surface with a hold so strong, that it can lift up most stringed instruments. This tight connection also allows for the vibration of the instrument to be easily transferred on to the tuner, providing the sensitivity and accuracy needed. With only 36mm (1.42 inches) in diameter this little mount can be placed almost anywhere on the instrument as long as the surface is flat and non-porous. If the surface is porous then you have the option to use one of the nearly invisible clear round stickers that will be included with the tuner. They will provide the necessary non-porous surface for the mount to cling on to the instrument. Most guitars for example have a high gloss finish, or painted surface, so that provides the adequate surface for the mount to cling on, WITHOUT the stickers.

Other than the color how is the Limited Edition tuner different?
The Limited Edition Tuner will be produced in limited quantity, so you will be one of the few people around the world that will have the opportunity to own this tuner. It will also include a small VELVET POUCH to store the tuner when not in use. It's convenient and will also provide the protection and respect that your Limited Edition Cling On™ Tuner deserves!

Who needs the Cling On™ Tuner?
Anybody playing a stringed instrument will benefit from having a Cling On™ Tuner. Whether you are a professional musician performing at concerts and gigs, or a teacher, student, or just a guitar aficionado, you have to tune your instrument. The Cling On™ Tuner is making tuning a lot easier and more fun. The popular clip tuner is primarily used by guitarists because it can clip to the headstock. However, that is the only place where this tuner can be attached to. On the contrary, the Cling On™ Tuner gives you the flexibility to attach it ANYWHERE on ANY string instrument as long as there is a flat section on the instrument with the size of the mount (36mm/ 2.41"").

Where is the Cling On™ Tuner in the development process?
It has been a lot of hard work to design and construct all the necessary components, including all plastic parts, printed circuit board, LCD screen and backlight. But I am happy to announce that at the time of starting this campaign most of the work in the design, development and testing have been completed and the results have been outstanding. The Cling On™ Tuner  is currently in pre-production stage, meaning that all components have been designed, constructed and tested. All CAD files are completed and verified, and they are ready for the production process. What you see in the video and the pictures are fully functional prototypes. What's left is to finalize few minor tweaks in the programming, as well as the exact color that would be the closest to what you see in the rendering.
 
Where is it going to be manufactured?
I have established a relationship with a highly reputable company in China that specializes in manufacturing digital musical equipment including tuners, so this isn't a new venture for them. From the first sketch to pre-production they have been extremely professional and very attentive to my requests to make the Cling On™ Tuner exactly the way I envisioned it. I am very confident that you would be completely satisfied with the outcome of the first production run of the Cling On™ Tuner.
 
Why do I need your support?
There are over 15 different components (not counting nuts and bolts), including over 10 plastic parts that require building tools for the injection molding, as well as several electronic components including the PCB panel, LCD and backlight. At this point, we completed and tested the tools for all plastic components, so they are ready for mass production. Manufacturing the PCB panel and the LCD is very technological and sophisticated process. They are both designed and ready for production. To be able to get to a price point that would make financial sense, these components will have to be produced on a much larger scale. Your support is giving me the financial leverage I need to lower the production cost. 
 
Why would you consider supporting this project!
 By contributing to this project you are not only going to get the Cling On Tuner at a great price, but more importantly you are becoming an integral part of this journey. With your support you are essentially helping make this idea become a reality.

SPECIAL THANKS:
Creating a new product from start to finish can't be done by just one person, regardless of his or her experience. I am extremely grateful to everyone involved in this project. If it wasn't for their trust, help and professionalism, as well as patience, the Cling On™ Tuner would not have been possible. I can't make this in my garage:)
Without any particular order I want to express my SINCERE THANKS to:
- The manufacturing partner in China with their amazing team of engineers and designers.
- Stanislav Evstatiev, Svilen Dimitrov, and  Vladimir Stanchev from Zoom Design for working so hard on creating the two wonderful animations just for this campaign.
- Verginiya Kadina for designing the logo, retail packaging, various graphic design work, and her professional advice.
- My brothers Nikola and Vasil Chekardzhikov, who played and recorded with me (together as Triada Guitar Trio) the music for the classic animation.
- Grammy winning Los Angeles Guitar Quartet for letting me ""butcher"" their wonderful arrangement of the famous piece known as Pachelbel's ""loose"" Canon.
- Marcus Macmillan and James McMillan for recording and engineering the music for the classic animation and the video for this project.
- Alex Beroza (feat. 3amAssociation) for the permission to use ""Improvisation on a Friday"" (ccmixter.org, licensed under Creative Commons License 3.0)
- And last but not least, Thank You in advance to ALL of YOU INDIEGOGO SUPPORTERS!",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Why we are crowdfunding</h3>
<p>We are crowdfunding as a way to bring new and better products to market faster. We are a manufacturer so we already have the factories to make our product so we are able to develop products quickly and efficiently. We are also crowdfunding so that we can afford to create mass quantities of packs. This requires having a mold cut for the polymer piece that transmits light, and building up our inventory.</p>
<p>We are also looking to the potential users of our product to provide feedback so that we can improve and refine our current solution. We want to make the best, highest quality, and safest lighted pack possible, and the input of the public will make this goal attainable. We are also able to offer the best prices possible during the campaign, as a thank you to our buyers who are helping to support our development and refine our product.</p>

<h3>Risk and challenges</h3>
<p>Because we are manufacturers, having this product made is very low risk for us. We have a factory that already can make our product, so we won't need the time and effort that a crowdfunding campaign typically requires in this stage.</p>
<p>There are a few things we still have to consider. Currently, the polymer that transmits light is created by cutting from an extruded piece. To mass produce the BSEEN, we will need a mold. We still need to cut and test the mold, which will take some time. We also need to ensure the polymer is clear enough to transmit light from a distance. We don't think this will be a big roadblock for us, but it could potentially effect our timeline.</p>

</div></div>","Presenting the weather resistant LED waist pack that charges your phone. Perfect for runners, cyclists, hikers, walkers, parents and children - anyone that values safety and an active lifestyle will love the BSEEN!








The BSEEN is perfect for:





Press
Cult of Mac: ""You can charge your smartphone while cycling or running with an accessory also designed to keep you alive on the road. Sounds like a lot to ask of a battery pack, but the Boost Pack by BSEEN does both with a rather simple design.""
Incredible Gear: ""Meet BSEEN: a LED waist pack with multiple lighting modes that keeps you visible in the outdoors.""
Fitness Gizmos: ""It keeps you visible outdoors without getting in your way.""
Cool Wearable: ""It is lightweight, water resistant, and easy to use.""










Do you usually run in the dark?





According to RunKeeper, Americans run the most at 6am and 6pm.

That means that many people work out when it is dark. In some other countries, this time is even earlier in the morning or even later at night. 





The National Safety Council states that chances of being struck and killed as a pedestrian increase 1100% after dark. Reflectors provide some visibility, but are only effective in the presence of a light source, and can be hard to see from certain angles.




The BSEEN pack is illuminated as well as reflective, so you are even more likely to be seen. The battery will provide up to 180 hours of consecutive illumination in flash mode. Our lighted products can be seen from 250 yards away.



Has your phone ever died far from home?






Many people fear not having their phone available to them when they need it. On a long run or bike ride, you may be listening to music or using GPS, which can drain the batteries quickly. 











The BSEEN Boost pack has a 4000 mAh backup battery, which can give the average smartphone (iPhone 6, Samsung Galaxy, HTC One) a full charge and give you the peace of mind that you will stay connected when away from home. Listen to as much music as you want without worrying about draining the battery. The battery is removable, so it's easy to recharge and also take on the go without the pack.


AVAILABLE FOR BSEEN BOOST PERKS ONLY. The phone charging battery pack is not available for BSEEN Basic perks.



Know that your children are safe and seen.





The BSEEN waistband is highly adjustable, so even a young child can wear one. This pack is perfect for night walks and late family outings.




Store all of your necessities.





The BSEEN pack holds everything you need on the go. Store your cell phone, wallet, keys, chapstick, and anything else you might want with you. Use the pack for storage during a daytime hike or add the light for an evening walk. We've got you covered.




Go the distance.


Take the BSEEN anywhere far from home. Know that you can rely on the extra battery to take you all the way.
The BSEEN Boost pack has a 4000 mAh battery, which gives your smartphone a full charge.






Worried about running in the rain?


Know that your belongings are safe from raindrops. The BSEEN is made up of water resistant materials and closes with water resistant zippers.






Our packs ain't cheap.


BSEEN packs are made of quality materials and the construction is designed to last for years and years. We don't skimp on quality because we want this to be your go-to pack for a long time.

We have access to our materials in different colors, so we are offering four great combinations to choose from! We will reach out to you at the end of the campaign to get your color choice.



BSEEN Options
We are also offering a lower cost BSEEN pack. All features and specifications are the same as the regular BSEEN, but without a backup battery pack. This means you cannot charge your phone using the pack, but you will have a little more storage and a little less weight (the total weight of the Basic pack will be approximately 5oz). The lights are just as awesome, and will last 4-6 hours between charges. The battery is easily recharged via cable.












Features








LED lighted section, which can be set to continuous or two flashing settings


4000 mAh removable/rechargeable external battery to run lights and charge cell phone (BSEEN BOOST PERKS ONLY)


Main zip pocket to store phone and other necessities


Smaller interior pocket with velcro closure


Interior key clip


Headphone port


Water resistant easy to clean fabrics


Water resistant, smooth zippers


Reflective piping on various parts of the pack


Stretchy sides for a snug fit and less bounce


Adjustable waist belt with side-release buckle closure


Can be worn in front, in back or crossbody

We are limiting the number of apps we sell at $5 to only 500 as a way of thanking people who pre-buy and support the campaign. <em><strong>The next lot will be at $10</strong></em>.  We are in the process of completing a survey that will help determine the final price.  The <em><strong>suggested retail price is $20</strong></em>.
<br/><br/>
With AutoAAN, you pay once and never get charged again - kind of like buying an answering machine, but much more high tech. Even if you’re on a cheap plan, AutoAAN pays for itself just a few months.
AutoAAN will work in the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, Japan - <em><strong>anywhere</strong></em>. Since the app resides on your phone it is independent of your mobile provider so it will work on <em><strong>any cellular carrier</strong></em>.<br/><br/>
If 1 million people made the investment of AutoAAN, that would lead to savings of  $60,000,000*** which consumers get to keep instead of making the phone companies richer. VoIP started a tidal wave of long-distance savings; now AutoAAN is going to provide the same for voicemail users.

Your life is more dynamic than ""I'm not available, leave me a message."" You're in meetings, having dinner, out at a club, exercising and living! AutoAAN provides contextual messages to callers so they have a better understanding of your situation and when you'll be returning their important call.
Now you'll have options.<br/><br/>
 When your phone rings, you'll be provided with a list of answering messages for the caller to hear. Having a business lunch? Let the caller know, ""Hi, I'm at lunch right now, but should be finished in an hour or so. I'll return your message when I'm done."" In a noisy location? Let the caller know, ""Hey, it's really loud where I am right now, leave me a message and I'll call you from a quieter location shortly.""
<br/><br/>
AutoAAN will come with a number of professionally pre-recorded messages so you can get started immediately. If you want to record your own messages, you’ll be able to do that, too. Provide your caller with more details and more context than ANY other voicemail system!
<br/><br/><font color=""#666666"" size=""5""><b>Help us bring AutoAAN to market</b></font> <br/>
My name is Daniel Feuer, and I’m a long-time entrepreneur. AutoAAN was something that popped into my head through necessity. My mobile phone is an important tool for me and it’s kept close by at most times. Even when nature calls, my phone is with me - but it’s difficult to answer the phone at those times!  When that call literally happened to me, I really wanted to let the caller know that I was “busy” and that I'd call back in a few minutes - AutoAAN was born! <br/><br/>

AutoAAN is a perfect complement to basic voicemail.  Use the AutoAAN app for your primary voicemail and your carrier’s as a backup for the times you are out of the service area or your phone is off. Make sure what you have is really “free”. Some carriers bundle voicemail in an add-on package. Generally speaking if you have less options in your bundle by removing voicemail you’ll save yourself money!

AutoAAN is priced to be affordable. Some mobile providers charge more for few month’s worth of voicemail than it costs to have <strong>AutoAAN forever</strong>! <br/><br/><font color=""#666666"" size=""5""><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></font>

</tbody></table></div>","AutoAAN Answering Machine App Never Pay for Voicemail Again




Phone companies make 100’s of millions of dollars a year on voicemail. We want you to keep that money.
Automatic Answer And Notify (AutoAAN) is the answering machine app that lives in your smartphone! Now callers can leave a message directly on your phone - no voicemail service is required from your mobile provider. Buy AutoAAN once, and never pay for voicemail again!
Do you know how much you’re paying?

Many of us spend over $90 every year  for the privilege of having others leave us messages. You may not realize how much you’re paying because it’s bundled into a package, but here are some common voicemail prices in the US and Canada:






Save $600 With AutoAAN




 


Savings are based on a $5 monthly. The same cost of having AutoAAN forever!!!
 


For $5 you can have voice mail forever
We are limiting the number of apps we sell at $5 to only 500 as a way of thanking people who pre-buy and support the campaign. The next lot will be at $10.  We are in the process of completing a survey that will help determine the final price.  The suggested retail price is $20.

With AutoAAN, you pay once and never get charged again - kind of like buying an answering machine, but much more high tech. Even if you’re on a cheap plan, AutoAAN pays for itself just a few months.
AutoAAN will work in the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, Japan - anywhere. Since the app resides on your phone it is independent of your mobile provider so it will work on any cellular carrier.
If 1 million people made the investment of AutoAAN, that would lead to savings of  $60,000,000*** which consumers get to keep instead of making the phone companies richer. VoIP started a tidal wave of long-distance savings; now AutoAAN is going to provide the same for voicemail users.  




Sample AutoAAN Now!A new browser will open to demonstrate the app



 



""I'm watching cat videos, please leave a message""

Your life is more dynamic than ""I'm not available, leave me a message."" You're in meetings, having dinner, out at a club, exercising and living! AutoAAN provides contextual messages to callers so they have a better understanding of your situation and when you'll be returning their important call.
Now you'll have options.
 When your phone rings, you'll be provided with a list of answering messages for the caller to hear. Having a business lunch? Let the caller know, ""Hi, I'm at lunch right now, but should be finished in an hour or so. I'll return your message when I'm done."" In a noisy location? Let the caller know, ""Hey, it's really loud where I am right now, leave me a message and I'll call you from a quieter location shortly.""

AutoAAN will come with a number of professionally pre-recorded messages so you can get started immediately. If you want to record your own messages, you’ll be able to do that, too. Provide your caller with more details and more context than ANY other voicemail system!
Help us bring AutoAAN to market 
My name is Daniel Feuer, and I’m a long-time entrepreneur. AutoAAN was something that popped into my head through necessity. My mobile phone is an important tool for me and it’s kept close by at most times. Even when nature calls, my phone is with me - but it’s difficult to answer the phone at those times!  When that call literally happened to me, I really wanted to let the caller know that I was “busy” and that I'd call back in a few minutes - AutoAAN was born! 
We’ve been working on AutoAAN for over three years and she’ll be coming to market no matter what, but we can do it more quickly with your support.  Developers have been working diligently for many months on the UI and programming to make AutoAAN a reality. Proceeds from this campaign will go to our developers so they can complete the app ASAP. So why should you support us? 
You believe that you should be in control of your voicemail.
You want to be the first to break away from your carrier’s antiquated voicemail system.
You want to provide context to people when they leave you a message.
You could save yourself $100’s of dollars by forgoing perpetual voicemail billing.

Realize the potential of what an app like AutoAAN can achieve: there’s never been a voicemail app that resides in your phone. Together, we can provide a competitive alternative to overpriced voicemail. Why does voicemail suck? 

You mean besides the cost, being locked to a provider, limited message storage, and no contextual messages?
Length limits. Limits on voicemail length may be the stuff of romantic comedy, but they are so 1990s. AutoAAN has no length limits. Storage limits. How often do you hear “This mailbox is full” when you try to call your friends? With AutoAAN, the number of messages that can be stored is only limited by the free space on your phone. AutoAAN puts voicemail control where it belongs - in your hands. The voicemail is on your phone, not on someone else’s computer system. Uni-Message. Current voicemail technology only allows for one message to be played to callers.  Contextual voicemail allows for real-time, dynamic playback of messages to callers specifying your situation. Why doesn’t this exist already?

I’ve spent over three and a half years trying to build the technology behind this, beyond that, your guess is as good as mine. With over a million apps*** out there, why has no one succeeded in disrupting the huge, profitable voicemail industry?
But what if I get voicemail free from my provider?

AutoAAN is a perfect complement to basic voicemail.  Use the AutoAAN app for your primary voicemail and your carrier’s as a backup for the times you are out of the service area or your phone is off. Make sure what you have is really “free”. Some carriers bundle voicemail in an add-on package. Generally speaking if you have less options in your bundle by removing voicemail you’ll save yourself money!

AutoAAN is priced to be affordable. Some mobile providers charge more for few month’s worth of voicemail than it costs to have AutoAAN forever! Frequently Asked Questions
