<p><strong>Bring Dharavi Back to Life!</strong></p>
<p><strong>We rise by lifting others</strong></p>
<p>Robert Ingersoll</p>
<p>Dharavi was first put on the global map with the success of the multi Oscar winning movie, ‘Slumdog Millionaire’. It’s first ‘local to global’ brand Dharawear will again catapult this famous slum located in Mumbai to a global stature, and more importantly bring income and livelihood to its pandemic affected workers. Dharawear will undertake its full manufacturing here, including tarnishing, cutting, and packaging. Among the products are 100% genuine leather, premium quality, ride-ready bomber jackets at unbelievably low prices.</p>
<p><u><strong>IDEA ABOUT CHANGE:</strong></u></p>
<p>As a group of individuals, we have decided to come together and help Dharavi craftsman to fight this pandemic situation by launching an exclusive range of leather products globally. Our team of skilled fashion designers started working with these craftsmans to bring their dream into reality. We groomed them at such a extent that they can outperform in global market. Now we are in a position to come up with an exclusive international brand ""DHARAWEAR™"" and we are launching this brand on one of the exclusive platform of KICKSTARTER. We hope this campaign would ""BRING DHARAVI BACK TO LIFE""</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>
<div dir=""ltr"">
<p>Talking about the impact of this mission, here are some hopeful points. If you buy one pair of jackets you will contribute to the books for two children for the entire year. If you buy a 2Xjackets, you can contribute to the education of a child. Similarly, if someone places multiple orders he can help survive the entire family for the next 6 to 12 months. Above all, this will give employment to thousands of sole bread earners of their families. We feel so strong whenever we imagine how it feels when a father of a poverty-stricken family returns home with income to feed his young ones, to pay for their child's education. As local residents of Dharavi, we realized that no matter how meager someone's financial situation is, he always looks at his children with hope. A hope that someday his child will vanquish all the darkness of poverty. It's our mission to keep that hope alive.</p>

<p>Asia’s largest slum with over 1 million people cramped in just over 3 sq. km of space has been hit very hard by the Covid lockdown. The fighting spirit of its population reflects in the way it has been able to curb the spread of the virus. With Dharawear, the workers will again reveal their multi-talented facet to the world by making high-quality leather jackets and products at unbeatable prices.</p>
<p>“Due to the complete shutter down, there is no work in Dharavi, and with no work comes the greatest worry of mankind, poverty. We have decided to come together and help Dharavi craftsman to fight this pandemic situation by launching an exclusive range of leather products globally.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Hi, I’m Rani, founder of <a href=""http://guide2style.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">guide2style</a><br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>As a female engineer just beginning my budding career and
having just moved across the country to Silicon Valley, I needed a fashion
makeover for my new professional and social life. </p>
<p>But I couldn’t turn to my nerdy co-workers, so I decided to study
the rules of style to create <b>a software
version of a fashionable friend</b> – and <a href=""http://guide2style.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">guide2style</a> was born.  It later dawned on me that <a href=""http://guide2style.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">guide2style</a> would be useful for all women –
and eventually, men.  Scott, the owner of this Indiegogo campaign, was one
of my nerdy friends and because his life changed so much after I re-dressed him
he co-founded the company with me. (Unfortunately, due to my current employment
contract, my full name cannot be used here.)</p>
<p>For better or worse, <b>your
clothing choices determine much of the course of your life</b> (just ask
Scott!!), but most women have neither the time nor the desire to become a
fashion expert. So, they turn to their fashionable friend or a trusted stylist
for advice. But what if your friend isn’t available <i>right now</i> or you simply don’t have access to a stylist?  That’s where <a href=""http://guide2style.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">guide2style</a>
comes in!!  We’ve created an advice and
search engine so powerful, so detailed, that we believe she will change the
world by optimizing the appearance of, well, everyone (eventually), while still
keeping true to personal tastes and styles. This, in turn, will <b>empower women (and men) to look and feel
their best at all times</b>, giving them their best shot at pursuing their life’s
true calling. </p>
<p></p>

Hi, I’m Rani, founder of guide2style


As a female engineer just beginning my budding career and
having just moved across the country to Silicon Valley, I needed a fashion
makeover for my new professional and social life. 
But I couldn’t turn to my nerdy co-workers, so I decided to study
the rules of style to create a software
version of a fashionable friend – and guide2style was born.  It later dawned on me that guide2style would be useful for all women –
and eventually, men.  Scott, the owner of this Indiegogo campaign, was one
of my nerdy friends and because his life changed so much after I re-dressed him
he co-founded the company with me. (Unfortunately, due to my current employment
contract, my full name cannot be used here.)
For better or worse, your
clothing choices determine much of the course of your life (just ask
Scott!!), but most women have neither the time nor the desire to become a
fashion expert. So, they turn to their fashionable friend or a trusted stylist
for advice. But what if your friend isn’t available right now or you simply don’t have access to a stylist?  That’s where guide2style
comes in!!  We’ve created an advice and
search engine so powerful, so detailed, that we believe she will change the
world by optimizing the appearance of, well, everyone (eventually), while still
keeping true to personal tastes and styles. This, in turn, will empower women (and men) to look and feel
their best at all times, giving them their best shot at pursuing their life’s
true calling. 



From the fashion-savvy to the style-curious, guide2style was built with every woman in mind. Powerful, proprietary, artificial intelligence provides occasion-specific written advice to suit your body type, complexion, tastes, and personality based on a user profile. 
Pulling from over 150,000 rules of style, you can be sure guide2style will help you look your very best.  She then searches over 10,000 online garments to find the best pieces to match the advice enabling you to shop instantly.








Our dressing room allows you to save garments for later, letting you easily come back to the perfect outfit for another occasion while 

Our forum creates community and gives users a voice among fellow fashion lovers.




The first version of guide2style is live, right now, and with our Indiegogo campaign, we’re asking for the funds we need to continue development and raise awareness.
With the funds raised through this campaign, we plan to: 



Gain a little corporate and legal assistance,
Launch a much larger marketing and PR push, 
Add an inherently social feature to the website.

We hope this small amount of funding will enable us to then rely on the revenue generated from online click-through garment sales commissions for continued product development.



As we continue to improve our current toolset, we’re always looking for ways to grow and provide innovative ways to stay stylish. 
We believe that we have a great website that offers top-notch advice and shopping, but our sights are already set on the future.


One specific idea: we want to offer daily outfit suggestions based on your existing 

Wardrobe, 

 
Local weather, and

 
Events on your calendar.  



Imagine this... 

A young professional has a busy week ahead in her home and work life. Posing the simple question, 

“Ok guide2style, what should I wear today?” 
will yield results tailored to her weekly events. The customized response could be, 

“According to your calendar you have an important business meeting today and weather.com says it’s going to be raining and cold. I suggest your grey pants suit along with your overcoat.""



""And, since I have you, you have a date on Friday night, yet I don’t see anything appropriate in your closet. Would you like me to provide you some options from the Web?”  







We have the technology to do this today. We just need the time and resources to build it.

And we have other features in mind  


We want to use the intense detail of our database to search for a specific, envisioned garment with little more than a few swipes of your finger. We call this “Dress Well, by You.”  





We’d also like our users to be able to use a picture of a garment to receive feedback on whether it would look good on them - we're temporarily calling this ""Reverse Advice,"" but we need a better name. Please help us out via our Community if you can think of something better.


We have a lot of other really cool ideas as well, and we need to make sure all of these features are wrapped into an experience that is optimized for PCs, tablets, and smart phones.












Please, check out our site 
It’s a fully functioning search website, with the base technology for all of our ideas above incorporated and on display.

<p>Never slip on ice and hurt yourself again! I bring you the gift to beat the wrath of mother nature, once and for all, step by step.</p>
<p>We all hate slipping on ice. It hurts both body and ego, but for some reason we can land a robot on a flying rock in space but we can't stop slipping on ice? Well not anymore! For with a simple bit of complex genius and innovation I have found a way to fix the world of this problem once and for all, but I need your help. I only have half the prototype done so I need some cash for another shoe. As it will be to complete the prototype all I can offer you is first dibs on the final product (estimated October 2019, depending on how successful this is) but you can also sleep well knowing that you have made your footprint (get it?) in shoe science and walking technology.</p>
<p>If I succeed the financial needs I ask for I will put all extra money into my science work of trying to find out just what ice is, where it comes from and why it finds its way onto our streets. It's science, but for humanity.</p>
<p>My biggest challenge so far was finding the right kind of salt (Cornish) and only having one shoe. My biggest fears are faliure and type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>I'm just a small town boy with big city boy ideas. I hope to safely change the world through science and shoes.</p>
<p>*DISCLAIMER*</p>
<p>I only need 20 bucks to finish my prototype but I cannot request any less than 500 here, so all extra money will be invested in the science behind why ice is ice. I also lost the original prototype so I now need to buy a pair of shoes to complete it, but this can be done on the original 20 euro goal, I think. 23 tops.</p>

<h1>How does work?</h1>Crowdfunding not something you do everyday? Here's the concept, you as a collective of awesome people pool your resources, with ours and together we aim for a goal. When we say pool resources, the process goes like this, you click the contribute button, choose what perk (or you can choose to not have one if you really prefer) and then you give your money to the Indiegogo system. Then, if we achieve our goal, Indiegogo gives your money to us. This is a security feature for us all- we can't take your money and run, and you can't promise us and then leave us stranded. <p></p>
<p>You may well be asking what happens
if we don't make the goal? Your money will be refunded to you, because we can't
offer you the perks without the software to create them. So please, don't
forget to contribute and share so we can make this a reality! Since we're also well invested into this project-having already funded the list itself, we'll also invest more ourselves to help cover the goal if we get close, because we really want to bring you the services of Thou Art 3d!</p>
<p>Not quite convinced you want to wait? We've also decided to put our money where our ideas are, and all sales of our chain maille from now, until the end of the campaign will also be added to the campaign. Thats all labour costs as well! So feel free to check out our store and see how you feel about our Chain Maille Creations! <a href=""http://www.thouart3d.tictail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.thouart3d.tictail.com</a></p>

<p>We
concluded we weren't the biggest fans of beads on loops, so we started work on
designing new and interesting sets of glass charms, (so you can find your
glass, and not someone else's). We'll print you the 6 all in one colour, or in
multiple, the choice is up to you, and then we will send them on those familiar
metal loops, so you can easily hook them onto drinking glass stems, or the
handles of your favourite mugs.</p>
<p>Current
planned themes include Smileys, Musical Instruments, Assorted Punctuation,
Cheers in many languages, and so many more to come! Each theme will have 6 different but related designs, for example the Punctuation theme would have ?, !, @, %, ..., (). The smileys would be :-), ;-), :-P, :-D, :-O, B-).</p>
<p>Your
choice of colours in plastics are Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple,
Black and White.</p>
<p>Additionally, we will be opening our store, exclusively for you, and offering you 15% any additional products, as a special thanks for your support!</p>
<p>Shipping
within Australia is included, if you happen to live somewhere else, please add
$7 for shipping, so you can get your charms in good time.</p>

<p></p>
<p>True story, we also love to work in chain maille. So we thought
we would offer you a lovely discount for your support. We'll offer you a choice
of three weaves, and 12 colours, all in anodised aluminium. Why aluminium you
might ask? Its lighter (by about three times), doesn't rust like say steel (so
yes you can swim or shower while wearing it), and the colour is anodised into the surface, not painted on. </p>
<p>Our store will also include our chain maille works, so you can get a necklace to match (or anything else you can think of) in our exclusive store opening as well. The 15% discount applies to all products, chain maille included!</p>
<p>The 12 colours (At the close of the campaign, we'll check in
with you so you can choose) are Black, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Red, Orange, Yellow,
Green, Blue, Purple, Violet and Pink. </p>
<p>Additionally, we will be opening our store, exclusively for you, and offering you 15% any additional products, as a special thanks for your support!<br/></p>
<p>The 3 weaves are Box, Persian, and Trizantine, shown in
black and silver.</p>

<p></p>
<p>So we took a look at night lights one day, and noticed that
there really isn't much variety. Which got us thinking that when you look
through plastic sheets at light, you can see creases. Now creases aren't the
best fun, but we work with 3d printing, so we can do so much more. So we plan
to print a box (modular in design so you can mix and match the designs),
containing a couple of white LEDs to shine through plastic, displaying designs,
which would otherwise be invisible. Currently we're dreaming about retro games,
to show off your geekier side, and for you wordsmiths, hide some quotes and
phrases, revealed by the power of light!</p>

<p>Look from one side see one word, look from the other, see a
different word, look from anywhere else, see a crazy mass of shapes. Which is a
little bit of a puzzle for your brain, but thats not the best part, its also a
puzzle, and only when you fit the pieces together can you read those words at

even better give a nod to that couple you know, with his name on one side and
hers on the other. </p>

<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>Our designer comes from a background of teaching and technical support for Solidworks (the modelling software), certified in both, as well as general use. She started working in 3d design and modelling way back in high school, and hasn't stopped since, even doing an engineering degree to bolster her skills. </p>
<p>Our product tester comes from a creative side of life, enjoying
everything from sketching to sewing, so she bounces ideas, and double checks them right from the start. </p>
<p>Our
tabletop gaming guru comes from years of games, and so knows what gamers want,
as well as the all important rules.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1>The Time Plan</h1>
<p>We've been working on this for a while, and the plan has changed
and morphed until it stabilized and we turned it into a flow chart.</p>
<p>We mention sending you a survey so we can find out what
sizes, colours, styles, and everything else you want for your perks. </p>
<p>We haven't been able to stop our Designer
working on ideas, and scribbling concepts down on practically every surface
since she came on board. Right now she's working on more ideas then we can fit
here from army-themed walls and buildings with our Tabletop Gaming Guru to 3d
puzzles and jewellery with our Product Tester.</p>
<p>So here is the plan;</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/67762/files/20130911085045-Full_Flow_Chart.JPG?1378914645"" src="""" style=""width: 220.51452282157675px; height: 364px;""/></p>
<p>So we've now updated the plan to include the use of a trial of Solidworks throughout the campaign, so you can see how serious we are! Also this means you can see an example of the perks!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1>The Future</h1>
<p>After the campaign, we will sell mainly through our online store as we build up our product base, to include all those offered here, as well as a whole lot more. From there we plan to expand into selling at markets.</p>
<p>Our plan is also to offer custom 3d printing, so if you've lost that button, dial, zipper pull, handle or basically anything, please feel to drop us a line at  thouart3d@gmail.com !</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1>Spread the Word</h1>
<p>Don't feel you can flash the cash? Want to do more? It would
mean so much to us if you share our campaign with your friends, family,
acquaintances, and anyone else you can think of. It will help our campaign even more if you use the
Indiegogo sharing tools, (the more you share, the closer we get to the top of
the list of campaigns).</p>
<p>We've started a blog, so you can keep updated with our designer's progress, both during and after the campaign, please check it out at <a href=""http://thouart3d.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://thouart3d.wordpress.com</a> </p>

We'd love to see you at our store, blog, or on facebook,

Greetings and Welcome,
We're Thou Art 3d, and we're a three person team dedicated to
making your dreams a reality. We want to bring 3d printing right to your
doorstep. You dream it, we create, print and send it to you. 
We've got so many ideas, the list seems endless, so heres a slice;


 Custom, Unique and Unusual glass charms(no more trying to remember which bead was yours) Jewellery worth playing with (gears, bearings, puzzles, games
and who knows what else we'll think of)

 Paperweight Trinkets, designed just for you (We started thinking of a dancing
chef teddy bear, and we haven't stopped since)


 Custom Tabletop gaming pieces (Always wanted to design your own? We're keen to do it. Want a wall believably built by orcs? We're
there.)


 Lost/Broken Game Pieces (Lost that little guy? Broken off that
hat? We can help. Personalized Pieces? One of our favorites!)


What is it we need?
At the very start of Thou Art 3d we started working out
exactly what we need to make this plan a reality.

 The
Enthusiasm
We've checked off everything except
for the software and for that we need your help. Why Solidworks? Solidworks is a market leader in 3d modelling, and its use in 3d printing is a proven track record. 
We've gotten several quotes for Solidworks, and this is how we will be using your pledges;





How does work?Crowdfunding not something you do everyday? Here's the concept, you as a collective of awesome people pool your resources, with ours and together we aim for a goal. When we say pool resources, the process goes like this, you click the contribute button, choose what perk (or you can choose to not have one if you really prefer) and then you give your money to the Indiegogo system. Then, if we achieve our goal, Indiegogo gives your money to us. This is a security feature for us all- we can't take your money and run, and you can't promise us and then leave us stranded. 
You may well be asking what happens
if we don't make the goal? Your money will be refunded to you, because we can't
offer you the perks without the software to create them. So please, don't
forget to contribute and share so we can make this a reality! Since we're also well invested into this project-having already funded the list itself, we'll also invest more ourselves to help cover the goal if we get close, because we really want to bring you the services of Thou Art 3d!
Not quite convinced you want to wait? We've also decided to put our money where our ideas are, and all sales of our chain maille from now, until the end of the campaign will also be added to the campaign. Thats all labour costs as well! So feel free to check out our store and see how you feel about our Chain Maille Creations! www.thouart3d.tictail.com
Referrals Competition! 

Thou Art 3d is running a Referrals
Competition! The person who refers our campaign to the most people will win a
specially made chain maille basket, (given our campaign succeeds) !




To enter all you need to do is;


1) Make a free Indiegogo account
2) Visit our campaign (while logged in)
3) Use the sharing tools to tell everyone
you know about our campaign
4) We'll keep track and the account holder
with the most referrals, at the end of the campaign, will win the basket!


Speaking of Perks


Want some more details before you send in your hard
earned cash? Makes sense to us, so here's more about each perk. Your question not answered, or want to see something else included? Feel free to drop us a line!
Everyone who contributes will also receive an exclusive invitation to view our online store weeks before everyone else, with a 15% discount on every product!



 Set
of 6 Mug/Glass Charms

We
concluded we weren't the biggest fans of beads on loops, so we started work on
designing new and interesting sets of glass charms, (so you can find your
glass, and not someone else's). We'll print you the 6 all in one colour, or in
multiple, the choice is up to you, and then we will send them on those familiar
metal loops, so you can easily hook them onto drinking glass stems, or the
handles of your favourite mugs.
Current
planned themes include Smileys, Musical Instruments, Assorted Punctuation,
Cheers in many languages, and so many more to come! Each theme will have 6 different but related designs, for example the Punctuation theme would have ?, !, @, %, ..., (). The smileys would be :-), ;-), :-P, :-D, :-O, B-).
Your
choice of colours in plastics are Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple,
Black and White.
Additionally, we will be opening our store, exclusively for you, and offering you 15% any additional products, as a special thanks for your support!
Shipping
within Australia is included, if you happen to live somewhere else, please add
$7 for shipping, so you can get your charms in good time.

Our designer has created some renderings for you, so you can see what we exactly what we mean, this is the Smileys set!








     
 Chain Maille Bracelet

True story, we also love to work in chain maille. So we thought
we would offer you a lovely discount for your support. We'll offer you a choice
of three weaves, and 12 colours, all in anodised aluminium. Why aluminium you
might ask? Its lighter (by about three times), doesn't rust like say steel (so
yes you can swim or shower while wearing it), and the colour is anodised into the surface, not painted on. 
Our store will also include our chain maille works, so you can get a necklace to match (or anything else you can think of) in our exclusive store opening as well. The 15% discount applies to all products, chain maille included!
The 12 colours (At the close of the campaign, we'll check in
with you so you can choose) are Black, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Red, Orange, Yellow,
Green, Blue, Purple, Violet and Pink. 
Additionally, we will be opening our store, exclusively for you, and offering you 15% any additional products, as a special thanks for your support!
The 3 weaves are Box, Persian, and Trizantine, shown in
black and silver.
Box


Persian

Trizantine




Shipping within Australia is included, if you happen to live
somewhere else, please add $5 for shipping, so you can get your bracelet in
good time.

     
 Voucher for 10% Off

This is fairly self explanatory, we'll send you a code, which
will give you 10% off all products you order (sadly shipping can't be discounted)
for six months. Thats all orders, no matter how many you make, no matter how
big the order. When we say 6 months, we mean from the public opening of the
store, so you're looking at mid 2014, leaving you plenty of time! 
Shipping all over is included, since we can email you the code! 
Additionally, we will be opening our store, exclusively for you, and offering you 15% any additional products, as a special thanks for your support! This 15% will stack with your 10% so during that sale you will get 25% off!

     
 Twin Bangles

You've seen friendship bracelets, and best friend necklaces?
Well this deal means you can have a pair of identical twins, or mix and match
for the perfect style! We'll be in touch at the end of the campaign to find out
what design you want, we'll have a pile of designs you can choose from, or you
can send us one. Want to check we can do it before you pledge? Drop us a line,
we'll be more than happy to check it out!
Your choice of colours in plastics are Red, Orange, Yellow,
Green, Blue, Purple, Black and White.
Additionally, we will be opening our store, exclusively for you, and offering you 15% any additional products, as a special thanks for your support!
Shipping within Australia is included, if you happen to live

in good time.

Those pile of designs we're promising? Here are a few for your perusal!
But first, heres a stack printed!



And the renderings;






And because we dearly love a challenge, 






     
 Double Printed Pendants

Not really a bracelet person? We've got pendants too! These will
ship with black ribbon so you can wear it as soon as it arrives, knotted
especially so you can have it any length. Got a suggestion for a design? We'd
love to hear it! Choose this perk and you get to choose from our stunning array
of designs, currently planned to include a functional ball bearing, a pile of
cash, various smiley faces, a few musical instruments, assorted punctuation,
and if our designer gets her way, a string of gears, all set to turn and mesh
just for you! 
Two Pendants printed just for you in your choice of colours in plastics are Red, Orange, Yellow,
Green, Blue, Purple, Black and White.
Additionally, we will be opening our store, exclusively for you, and offering you 15% any additional products, as a special thanks for your support!
Shipping within Australia is included, if you happen to live
somewhere else, please add $5 for shipping, so you can get your pendant in good
time.

Here's a few of that stunning array of designs for your enjoyment;
A fully functional ball bearing- jewellery worth playing with!


Also totally functional gears, they turn and they mesh- you could play all day!







     
 Glowing Box Light

So we took a look at night lights one day, and noticed that
there really isn't much variety. Which got us thinking that when you look
through plastic sheets at light, you can see creases. Now creases aren't the
best fun, but we work with 3d printing, so we can do so much more. So we plan
to print a box (modular in design so you can mix and match the designs),
containing a couple of white LEDs to shine through plastic, displaying designs,
which would otherwise be invisible. Currently we're dreaming about retro games,
to show off your geekier side, and for you wordsmiths, hide some quotes and
phrases, revealed by the power of light!
Your choice of colours in plastics are Red, Orange, Yellow,
Green, Blue, Purple, Black and White.
Additionally, we will be opening our store, exclusively for you, and offering you 15% any additional products, as a special thanks for your support!
Shipping within Australia is included, if you happen to live
somewhere else, please add $15 for shipping, so you can get your box in good
time.

     
 Custom Word Puzzle

Look from one side see one word, look from the other, see a
different word, look from anywhere else, see a crazy mass of shapes. Which is a
little bit of a puzzle for your brain, but thats not the best part, its also a
puzzle, and only when you fit the pieces together can you read those words at
all. We're thinking you could choose classic opposites like love and hate, or
even better give a nod to that couple you know, with his name on one side and
hers on the other. 
Your choice of colours in plastics are Red, Orange, Yellow,
Green, Blue, Purple, Black and White.
Additionally, we will be opening our store, exclusively for you, and offering you 15% any additional products, as a special thanks for your support!
Shipping within Australia is included, if you happen to live
somewhere else, please add $15 for shipping, so you can get your puzzle in good
time.

So we felt we should show you just what we mean by 'Custom Word Puzzle,' if you look at it you generally get something a little like this, and you can just read the words (Thou Art 3d...). 

If you look from the left, and right you can see the words clearly;




But wait, There's more! This design is also a puzzle, all those letters? Those are the tops of the pieces;



 Voucher for 25% Off

<p>   <strong>We at 42aFurnace aim to be an engine of Christian change</strong>, 30% of our net-profits go to Christian missions, and all of our shirts have Biblical themes flowing through them! Young men are the largest demographic missing from Churches today, on top of that many outsiders (and some insiders) view Christianity as a weak and feminized religion. Both of these are dangerous misconceptions that need to be addressed. 42aFurnace is in reference to Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego and the Son of God that saved them in Daniel chapter 3. Three men with extraordinary courage and conviction, who chose to be thrown into a <span>blazing</span> furnace rather than worship a false god. There is a need for Christian clothing that men can identify with and want to wear, our shirts are amazing tools to start conversations and spread God's word. Additionally if you want to give one as a gift every shirt has John 3:16 written in the collar.</p>
<p><strong><em>Vision: Fulfilling the great commission and glorifying God through Christian </em></strong><strong><em>clothing by empowering both missionaries and the common man.</em></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>   I know these shirts are not cheap. The expensive all-over printing method and
choosing the highest quality 100% cotton 100% made in the USA shirts are both factors
to the price point. Please understand that even if this project goes through at
the minimum unlock levels 42aFurnace will still lose money. Our mission is to
empower Christians, spread Gods word and be an engine to generate funds for
Christian missions. We welcome you to join us in the furnace. God bless - 42aFurnace
team.</p>

<h2><strong>Shipping Information</strong></h2>
<p>   Indiegogo is an amazing site, but one thing they don’t have is a shopping cart. What this means is that we need you to fill out your shipping information in this particular way. When making an order please type out your full name, then in the same line (in brackets) list the T-shirt name followed by the size you would like. Please do not include any numbers for any reason, if you want to get two XXL fishing shirts and a M crusader shirt please right it out as shown. (fishing XXL) (fishing XXL) (crusader M) (crusader L)</p>
<p><strong>   Remember please do not use any numbers when entering your order</strong>, simply write out each shirt order in its own brackets one after the other. The name bar will not run out of space.</p>

<p><strong>These are pre-shrunk shirts, while saying that, I’m sure you could shrink them a little more if you tried hard enough.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>There are always some risks</strong></h2>
<p>   Possibly the biggest is that the color you see on your screen is different to your neighbors which is different to the person down the street. Unless all of our monitors were color calibrated to the same specifications our monitors will all display colors differently. On top of this light (from your monitor) often shows up more vibrantly than ink (printed onto the t-shirts) and in a worste case senario it might fade s<span>lightly</span>. What this means is if you’re wanting a specific pantone number blue for your shirt to be ... we're all out of luck. Buuuuuuuuuut if you don’t mind your shirt being a great looking blue and not a specific blue number for example “Pantone 281C”, then we’re back in business and heading forward.</p>
<p>   The next Issue is that when a screen print is made it stays the same size when printing onto shirts sized from small to XXL. Sounds a little shocking doesn’t it? This phenomenon is industry wide and is solved with an ingenious trick, the artist designs a shirt with all the fundamental artwork fitting onto a small, but with lots of cool additional artwork around it to fill up a XXL. Below is a picture of a very cool Christian band we sponsor called <em>Kutting Ties,</em> these guys are wearing our <em>Crusader</em> shirt in sizes medium all the way up to triple extra large. It’s the exact same screen print but with extra art on the larger sizes. This means that the mock up might be slightly different to the shirt you get, but it will still be an awesome shirt.</p>

<p>   When you get a newspaper and you hold it <span>against your</span> nose you can see that the pictures are made up of thousands of little dots, this isn’t an issue because you’re never reading a newspaper from that short of a distance. Throughout the industry screen printing any kind of gradient or gentle tonal variation is done in this same way, but again since no one walking by you is going to have their eyes that close to your body no one will be able to see the dots.</p>
<p>   For a screen printer to be able to run a belt-printer in their facility means that they are in the big leagues, these are the same people who do printing for all the big names when they get their printing done in America. While it is very unlikely, if there was a surge of orders when we make ours the delivery date could be pushed back a week or two.</p>
<h2><strong>In Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>   There have only been two times in my life that have been called by God to do something, the first was when my sister was in trouble, the second was this. In face of all the struggles and failures I hope to be as courageous as Peter was to get out of the boat and walk on water. I’ll sink just like he did and Jesus will have to catch me too, but for those seconds when he was called and took those steps of faith something extraordinary happened.</p>

   We at 42aFurnace aim to be an engine of Christian change, 30% of our net-profits go to Christian missions, and all of our shirts have Biblical themes flowing through them! Young men are the largest demographic missing from Churches today, on top of that many outsiders (and some insiders) view Christianity as a weak and feminized religion. Both of these are dangerous misconceptions that need to be addressed. 42aFurnace is in reference to Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego and the Son of God that saved them in Daniel chapter 3. Three men with extraordinary courage and conviction, who chose to be thrown into a blazing furnace rather than worship a false god. There is a need for Christian clothing that men can identify with and want to wear, our shirts are amazing tools to start conversations and spread God's word. Additionally if you want to give one as a gift every shirt has John 3:16 written in the collar.
Vision: Fulfilling the great commission and glorifying God through Christian clothing by empowering both missionaries and the common man.

   I know these shirts are not cheap. The expensive all-over printing method and
choosing the highest quality 100% cotton 100% made in the USA shirts are both factors
to the price point. Please understand that even if this project goes through at
the minimum unlock levels 42aFurnace will still lose money. Our mission is to
empower Christians, spread Gods word and be an engine to generate funds for
Christian missions. We welcome you to join us in the furnace. God bless - 42aFurnace
team.

100% made in the USA

VeganCare is a cosmetic brand that cares for those who care. Our products are appropriated for everyone that cares about animals, including vegans and non-vegans. We never use animal ingredients and none of the products was or will ever be tested on animals. You´re the only one who will test them! And we are sure you will love them!
They are also adequate for those who search healthy and organic cosmetics.

<p>I began learning to make shoes about 4 years ago. I spent hours learning about all the details of fine footwear. The next time I went to to the mall to buy a pair of shoes I was shocked. The shoes at the mall were held together by glue, the leather was awful and they were disposable one season shoes. On top of that they were $120! I then went to a store that sold shoes up to my standards of quality. They were $500 to $1200 ! I was upset, it seemed like quality footwear in the mid-price range was non existent. I asked myself how this was possible? Could it possiblly cost hundreds of dollars more to make proper shoes? I decided to find out for myself. I took my now extensive knowledge of footwear and went to work.</p>
<p>I wanted</p>
<p>- A classic design</p>
<p>- A goodyear welt (for re-soling)</p>
<p>- Cork filling (for comfort and smell)</p>
<p>- Real quality leather</p>
<p>- Thick leather soles</p>
<p>- A soft leather lining</p>
<p>- A hand Made product</p>
<p>When all was said and done I had to look at price. Just as I expected these boots did not cost hundreds and hundreds of dollars to make. Why was nobody selling these? I asked around and found out that everybody wanted quality footwear they could have for years to come but they would never pay $600. I was fed up with the market for shoes. People had been taken advantage of because they didn't know any better. The $120 shoes were not worth $120 and the 600$ shoes were not worth $600. If nobody was going to give people a better option then it would have to be me.</p>
<p>1. Goodyear welt</p>
<p>Most shoes (even designer) hold the upper boot to the sole using only glue. These shoes can not be resoled and will be worn down within a year. We use a good year welt. It is a strong stitch that physically connects the upper to the sole. When the sole becomes worn you can have new soles put on for about 30 dollars. Which is a lot better than going to the mall to buy another $120 pair of shoes. </p>
<p>2. Appearance</p>
<p>We often see boots that claim to be quality. Rarely does the appearance of these boots remain fashionable for years. What good is having a boot that will last years if it goes out of style in 2 years? We avoided this by choosing a timeless design. The balmoral boot we designed is a simple single tone brown with one line of brougeing. This boot was fashionable in the mid 1800's and will be fashionable well into 2020.</p>
<p>3. Cork Filling</p>
<p>A detail that the eye can not see is the cork filling in a shoe. The natural cork material is more expensive than alternatives and almost never used in big retail shoes.  Cork is a natural material that absorbs odour and moulds  to the shape of the foot. If you have never had a cork filled shoe then you will have to feel it to believe it.</p>
<p>3.Leather Sole </p>
<p>A leather sole is unheard of in a big retail shoe. It is simply too expensive. Only on fine footwear will you ever see a thick leather sole.

</div></div>","I began learning to make shoes about 4 years ago. I spent hours learning about all the details of fine footwear. The next time I went to to the mall to buy a pair of shoes I was shocked. The shoes at the mall were held together by glue, the leather was awful and they were disposable one season shoes. On top of that they were $120! I then went to a store that sold shoes up to my standards of quality. They were $500 to $1200 ! I was upset, it seemed like quality footwear in the mid-price range was non existent. I asked myself how this was possible? Could it possiblly cost hundreds of dollars more to make proper shoes? I decided to find out for myself. I took my now extensive knowledge of footwear and went to work.
I wanted
- A classic design
- A goodyear welt (for re-soling)
- Cork filling (for comfort and smell)
- Real quality leather
- Thick leather soles
- A soft leather lining
- A hand Made product
When all was said and done I had to look at price. Just as I expected these boots did not cost hundreds and hundreds of dollars to make. Why was nobody selling these? I asked around and found out that everybody wanted quality footwear they could have for years to come but they would never pay $600. I was fed up with the market for shoes. People had been taken advantage of because they didn't know any better. The $120 shoes were not worth $120 and the 600$ shoes were not worth $600. If nobody was going to give people a better option then it would have to be me.
1. Goodyear welt
Most shoes (even designer) hold the upper boot to the sole using only glue. These shoes can not be resoled and will be worn down within a year. We use a good year welt. It is a strong stitch that physically connects the upper to the sole. When the sole becomes worn you can have new soles put on for about 30 dollars. Which is a lot better than going to the mall to buy another $120 pair of shoes. 
2. Appearance
We often see boots that claim to be quality. Rarely does the appearance of these boots remain fashionable for years. What good is having a boot that will last years if it goes out of style in 2 years? We avoided this by choosing a timeless design. The balmoral boot we designed is a simple single tone brown with one line of brougeing. This boot was fashionable in the mid 1800's and will be fashionable well into 2020.
3. Cork Filling
A detail that the eye can not see is the cork filling in a shoe. The natural cork material is more expensive than alternatives and almost never used in big retail shoes.  Cork is a natural material that absorbs odour and moulds  to the shape of the foot. If you have never had a cork filled shoe then you will have to feel it to believe it.
3.Leather Sole 
A leather sole is unheard of in a big retail shoe. It is simply too expensive. Only on fine footwear will you ever see a thick leather sole. An experienced eye will look to the sole to see if a shoe is expensive. Our sole is a beautiful piece of very thick leather like the sole's seen on Savile Row. 
4. Lining
A fine leather shoe would be ruined by a fabric lining. Despite that many big retailer still use fabric inside shoes. Leather is softer, more durable and a natural odour absorber. The soft and smooth calf in our boots is not visible to the outside world but the wearer will appreciate it's comfort.
5.Leather Upper
Many leather shoes in big retail use ""leather"" that has been purchased from a textile merchant. Our leather comes from a tannery. The hides arrive in the shape of a cows hide, not a large uniform square. Our leather is perfect for waxes, polishing and aging.

I searched for years to find a wallet that would be as small as possible, carry everything I needed, and still look good. In my search I only found wallets made of plastic, nylon, elastic, and metal.

<div>We're raising some money to fund our phase II of Dirty Dapper soap line<strong>. </strong>Here at Dirty Dapper, we believe that our men should also be spoiled for Valentines.

</div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to reach our $550 goal so we can package amazing products in phase II. Each Valentines Edition gift comes with the MAN-SCRUBBER burlap case, Dirty Dapper weekend bars and the naughty message for him to find. If we don't reach our goal, unfortunately, no one gets their Valentine Edition gifts.</p>
<p><strong>THE SCENTS: </strong>Activated Charcoal, Clean Bar and Dead Sea Mud</p>

</ul>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>It started out with a lady with a traveler's heart, being frustrated when it came to shopping for toiletries for her travel trips. There were those big crappy soap bars with gross ingredients and fumbling around with multiple toiletry bottles. Lightblub! She wanted to create an all-in-one soap that she could feel good about using - making it a travel-friendly size and made with all-natural high quality ingredients. Then Dirty Dapper was born. A sexy brand for people to feel sexy about being good to the environment and to their skin.</p>

<p>Hello!  I'm Jewel, an Entrepreneur from the beautiful Bahamas where I grew up influenced very much by the amazing Art Community.  A couple years ago I was lucky enough for the opportunity to pursue a passion I’ve desired for over 10 years.</p>
<p>I have now started a new career as a Fashion Designer and have been building my brand for the past 2 years.  It is a luxury swim &amp; resort wear brand for women.  This brand is greatly inspired, by my island.  The lifestyle… that sun, sand, &amp; sea.  The ocean breeze of this Paradise I call HOME!</p>
<p>In this time I have dedicated my energy and all resources to this project.  I have created a collection of beautiful, pieces, which embody strength, classic style and luxury.  With this collection I am proud to honor women who exemplify strength, leadership and courage.  It is important for me that my brand embodies these qualities and as a Designer, attention to fit and quality pieces are very important.</p>
<p>It is my dream to finally show pieces from my collection in the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Swim next year 2013 in Miami, FL.  At this show I will finally have the exposure I so desire to grow my brand and expose it to the world.</p>

<br/><p>Based on real life problem, designed by professionals,
developed in most IT-friendly environment, tested by world class athletes!</p>
<p>So, what we have to offer and why we're here:</p>
<ul>
<li>At first
     we did Laptop backpack. This is ready and on sale. For more
     information visit our <a href=""http://myq.clothing/products/backpack.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">homepage</a>.</li>
<li>Now we're
     ready for production faze of Tablet Hoody and Smartphone T-Shirt. Prototypes ready and tested, we need Your support to start the production.</li>
<li>Our Tablet
     Hoody and Smartphone T-Shirt are quite complex to manufacture. Therefore we
     have prepared choices for manufacturing. We can either manufacture these
     clothes in EU (Estonia), with guaranteed
     high quality, but also higher price. We can also manufacture in Pakistan, which has more risks on the quality but it's considerably
     cheaper. If You like our idea enough to support it, we'll let You decide
     where the initial manufacturing will be done.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Developing the new Tablet Hoody and Smartphone T-Shirt has
been fun, but it's also been expensive process. In order to validate our idea
and start up the mass production we're looking for at least 4000€, which allows
us to produce first 50 T-Shirt and 50 Hoodies in Pakistan. If the funding exceeds
the minimum requirement, our plans are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Below 4000
     EUR funding - well....we failed. We'll return all the money for our
     backers and start to guessing in our decisions and life choices :)</li>
<li>4000 EUR +
     funding.....things are looking up but we're are not all there yet. All the packers will receive products made in Pakistan, even to those who backed
     the EU (Estonia) production.</li>
<li>10300+
     EUR.... well guys, you have class - high quality produced in EU (Estonia) clothes can be ordered and every backer will
     receive the product produced where wanted. </li>
</ul>
<h3>The Timeline</h3>
<p>In case of 100%+ funding our plans are:</p>
<ul>
<li>After 30 days the funding phase will end.</li>
<li>The
     production will take 4-6 weeks;</li>
<li>With some luck
     and helpful postal workers, backers can find their brand new hoodies and
     t-shirts under their Christmas trees :)</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The situation we're in is following:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have
     already produced product (Laptop backpack) which is on sale</li>
<li>We have
     developed 2 new products which are ready for mass production</li>
<li>We have
     production agreement with EU and Pakistan factories for production (we know
     how much does it cost and how much time it takes)</li>
<li>In case of
     full funding we can start up the mass production earlier than expected. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Since the hard work is done - products are fully developed
and tested, IT-systems are ready, logistics are in place, our notable risks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manufacturing
     process. Due to complexity there might be delays in manufacturing. These
     are all problems expected in first patch of products, but we have
     professional clothes designer in our team to work out these problems.</li>
<li>Our main
     concern is producing in Pakistan. There is serious concern about quality and
     production delays due to political situation, but we have backup plan to switch manufacturers form
     Pakistan to China. </li>
<li>If You
     want less risk, back the EU (Estonia) option, there we can physically oversee the
     production and everything else is already done by us.</li>
</ul>

<p dir=""ltr"">We know that if we raise the economic well-being of women, their families and communities will be lifted up with them. As part of the Lotus Wonders business model, we will train women and develop their long-term economic prospects  by providing them with sustainable, more than fair wages.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr""> Beyond providing work opportunities and income, we will also be contributing an extra 20% of their wage to a community fund, <strong>the Wonder Fund</strong>, that will invest in local projects that the women and their communities decide are most needed.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Is a source of water the most important need for them?  Do they need bicycles for the children to get to a school some distance away?  Heck, do they need a school in their village?  Do they need to improve some housing, some roadways, a power source?  The women themselves will be in charge to decide what is best for their village.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>Hi Indiegogo!   I started Lotus Wonders after more than 10 years of working in Cambodia as a women’s rights advocate with major international development agencies including UN and most importantly the Cambodian Women's Rights Movment . I always tell people, I am a daughter of land of Persia, I live in the maginificant land of Canada but I was fortunate to be spiced and inspired by the land of Khmers, Cambodia.Lotus Wonders is a story of my FRIENDSHIP with Cambodia, Cambodian Women,Cambodian People, and my Passion for Women's Empowerment! </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Land Evictions is at the present one of the most significant problems that Cambodia faces and Women increasingly are at the center of the resistance to forced evictions in their communities. The centrality of women in land evictions can be seen through the fact that home -the center of their lives- is under attack.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">I first hand came to know how hundreds of thousands of women have lost their jobs and their ability to provide for their families as they have been forced to move from their land to make room for modernization and large-scale farming.   </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Many of these women and their families are existing on less than $2 a day. Something needed to be done, so we started Lotus Wonders to help and to do our share.  We are creating business and job opportunities for women affected by land evictions.  We believe that we can rally individuals into a movement that links these skilled seamstresses in Cambodia with western markets -  consumers like you who want unique and beautifully made accessories.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">I hope you will join the movement to invest in women and their communities.  When you purchase a Lotus Wonders product, YOU help us take one step further towards our goal : Women's Economic Empowerment, One Village at a Time.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>1. Workforce</span></strong></p>
<p><span>We have developed our supply line in the first village and we are ready to produce and ship your orders, however if we get a HUGE number of orders there may be delays in shipping your items. We have put in place some backup plans for when we get your OVERWHELMING support, including the use of another group of skilled and trained women in Cambodia with disabilities. So don’t worry about ordering another Perk (really... we don’t mind!).</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>2. Fabric</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The fabrics used in Lotus Wonders products come in many different colours and patterns. We've picked our favorite colours and have ordered enough to fulfil MORE than just the orders needed to reach our goal. However, we may run out of particular colours if every single person orders the same colour, or we may get so many orders that we have to buy more fabric. There is a slight chance that we may not be able to secure the same colour again if it runs out, but we will be communicating such issues with you transparently and do everything we can to get you your top choice of colour! </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong> </strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""> <strong>FAQ</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>1. When and how can I choose which colour I will <strong>receive</strong>?</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Shortly after the campaign is over, we will send you a link to our website where you can pick the colour you like most.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>2. When will I receive my case(s)?</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We will do our best that the products are ready to be shipped before mid October. However, we hope the shipment starts earlier.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>3. What if I forget to pay my shipping costs during my contribution?</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">You can log in to your Indiegogo account, check the shipping cost that applies to your perk and your shipping address, and then click on ""<strong>Contribute Now</strong>"" to the right of the pitch video. Enter the amount there and follow the payment process as you did before. If you used the same Indiegogo account as before, you don't need to contact us to verify the payment as we will automatically merge your two payments in our system. If you made a payment with another Indiegogo account, please contact us for further instruction.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>4. What is Fair Wage and what is Minimum Wage?</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The minimum wage in Cambodia was $61/mo until a few months ago. Earlier in May 2013, Unions were fighting to increase it to $120 * but could not succeed in the last round of negotiations and finally settled down for $80. What we considered as a fair wage is the amount that Unions were asking for and therefore we intend to set Lotus Wonders' wage to be at least 10% over $120 to ensure a fair practice. This will set our wage 65% more than what all big multi-national companies pay to their workers.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""> </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>5. Is Lotus Wonders a charity?</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">No. We are a for-profit business incorporated federally in Canada. We consider ourselves a social enterprise.</p>
<p>A social enterprise is a business that exists to make a direct positive social impact on the world. It is innovative and unique because:</p>
<ul>
<li>A social enterprise aims to make a profit, and then use these profits to support its social goals.</li>
<li>A social enterprise also provides products that further these social goals.</li>
<li>A social enterprise unlocks other ways to make a difference through your consumer choices and actions.When a consumer purchases a product from a social enterprise, he or she makes a tangible, positive impact.</li>
</ul><p>Social enterprises differ from for-profit businesses that merely promote social responsibility. While these businesses often support social change through their policies of corporate social responsibility, the company’s first goal remains to make a profit. A social enterprise, on the other hand, takes social change as its primary objective, and uses its profits to reach it</p>

Unique Style  All of our handmade iPad and card cases feature bold patterns and vibrant colours that stand out from the crowd.
 

 Highest Quality   Every Lotus Wonders product is exquisitely hand tailored from the finest fabrics by Cambodian women

 


 
Investment in Women   By purchasing an iPad or card case, you are supporting sustainable livelihoods for women and their families, and contributing to the Wonder Fund for community development.
 
Movement   By choosing Lotus Wonders you are joining a movement that brings together savvy consumers to support women in the developing world.
 
 Genuine   Our founder, Mehrak Mehrvar, spent the past 13 years advocating for women’s rights in different countries including Afghanistan, Cambodia,Indonesia and Iran. She started Lotus Wonders when she saw first hand the transformation that can occur when women artisans in the developing world are connected with western markets.
 
Sustainable   Lotus Wonders pays above fair wages AND we contribute an additional 20% beyond those wages to community development through the Wonder Fund so that everyone in the community benefits from your purchase.  Everybody wins! 
 
 


We know that if we raise the economic well-being of women, their families and communities will be lifted up with them. As part of the Lotus Wonders business model, we will train women and develop their long-term economic prospects  by providing them with sustainable, more than fair wages.  
 Beyond providing work opportunities and income, we will also be contributing an extra 20% of their wage to a community fund, the Wonder Fund, that will invest in local projects that the women and their communities decide are most needed.
Is a source of water the most important need for them?  Do they need bicycles for the children to get to a school some distance away?  Heck, do they need a school in their village?  Do they need to improve some housing, some roadways, a power source?  The women themselves will be in charge to decide what is best for their village.



In doing this, the women develop their role as community leaders and the work opportunities benefit more members of the village - touching more and more lives. 
The Wonder Fund turns an investment in women into an investment in the whole community.

 
 
We have finalized our prototypes and made our samples with the help of women in the first village in Cambodia who tailor and handcraft our products, and secured all of the fabrics and materials needed.
NOW WE JUST NEED YOU TO SUPPORT OUR CAMPAIGN so we can launch our first product line and begin to change lives, ONE VILLAGE AT A TIME!

If we are successful in this campaign, our sales team will take the product to major retailers across North America and Europe. Your support in this Indiegogo campaign will help us convince retailers that these products are highly marketable.
Once we have retail distribution, we will be able to establish the next Lotus Wonders village teams, hire and train the next group of women affected by land rights issues and fully equip more workplaces. We intend to make an impact by continuously expanding our efforts so that women can achieve economic indpendence throughout the developing world, ONE VILLAGE AT A TIME.
 
 
Launching Lotus Wonders iPad and card cases is just the first step.
Join the movement and help us achieve economic empowerment for women, One Village at a Time.  Spread the word and let's make this world colorful together!

Risks and challenges
1. Workforce
We have developed our supply line in the first village and we are ready to produce and ship your orders, however if we get a HUGE number of orders there may be delays in shipping your items. We have put in place some backup plans for when we get your OVERWHELMING support, including the use of another group of skilled and trained women in Cambodia with disabilities. So don’t worry about ordering another Perk (really... we don’t mind!).
 
2. Fabric
The fabrics used in Lotus Wonders products come in many different colours and patterns. We've picked our favorite colours and have ordered enough to fulfil MORE than just the orders needed to reach our goal. However, we may run out of particular colours if every single person orders the same colour, or we may get so many orders that we have to buy more fabric. There is a slight chance that we may not be able to secure the same colour again if it runs out, but we will be communicating such issues with you transparently and do everything we can to get you your top choice of colour! 
 
 FAQ
1. When and how can I choose which colour I will receive?
Shortly after the campaign is over, we will send you a link to our website where you can pick the colour you like most.
2. When will I receive my case(s)?
We will do our best that the products are ready to be shipped before mid October. However, we hope the shipment starts earlier.
3. What if I forget to pay my shipping costs during my contribution?
You can log in to your Indiegogo account, check the shipping cost that applies to your perk and your shipping address, and then click on ""Contribute Now"" to the right of the pitch video. Enter the amount there and follow the payment process as you did before. If you used the same Indiegogo account as before, you don't need to contact us to verify the payment as we will automatically merge your two payments in our system. If you made a payment with another Indiegogo account, please contact us for further instruction.
4. What is Fair Wage and what is Minimum Wage?
The minimum wage in Cambodia was $61/mo until a few months ago. Earlier in May 2013, Unions were fighting to increase it to $120 * but could not succeed in the last round of negotiations and finally settled down for $80. What we considered as a fair wage is the amount that Unions were asking for and therefore we intend to set Lotus Wonders' wage to be at least 10% over $120 to ensure a fair practice. This will set our wage 65% more than what all big multi-national companies pay to their workers.

5. Is Lotus Wonders a charity?
No. We are a for-profit business incorporated federally in Canada. We consider ourselves a social enterprise.
A social enterprise is a business that exists to make a direct positive social impact on the world. It is innovative and unique because:

A social enterprise aims to make a profit, and then use these profits to support its social goals.
A social enterprise also provides products that further these social goals.
A social enterprise unlocks other ways to make a difference through your consumer choices and actions.When a consumer purchases a product from a social enterprise, he or she makes a tangible, positive impact.
Social enterprises differ from for-profit businesses that merely promote social responsibility. While these businesses often support social change through their policies of corporate social responsibility, the company’s first goal remains to make a profit. A social enterprise, on the other hand, takes social change as its primary objective, and uses its profits to reach it

""The Bella is the world's first and only freestanding designer handbag with an integrated tablet window, embedded rechargeable battery supply, interior light and glowing external spine, so you have the power to go go go!""
 

The Bella shown in ""Bossy Blue"" w/ tablet flap in the closed position.
When we began development of the UNRULY GIRL handbag, the goal was to create a fashionable, attractive purse with great technology and cool features tucked neatly inside, without sacrificing visual appeal. The result is the beautiful Bella - 100% girly on the outside and super nerdy on the inside. :)

Less Tools: Only your hands, 1 piece of Toyish Projects designed leather, 2 pairs of brass screws and buttons! No preparation is needed! Unlike conventional hand stitching, you may need needles, wax threads, tooth prickling iron, etc….. 
Easy and User-friendly: No special skills on leather is required when you hand on it. With the simple instruction guide, everyone can finish it without getting any troubles and help, even kids and elderly.
Experience: While others are using hand-stitched leather goods, your Toyish bag will be the special one. It will be a good way to start a conversation with this innovative design and share your DIY experience to friends that its actually simple and stylish.
Less Cost: As we save the input of the leather craftsmanship and unnecessary tools, the final cost is lower. However, the quality can still be superior.

<li>This go round after requests from so many people who supported our first endeavor we focus on those who want footwear strictly for work purposes.  Bartenders, hostesses, back of house, front of house, hospitality, security personnel and others who just want a great shoe.  This shoe will also pique the interest of those who dress casually in other industries like tech and education.</li>
<li>If this campaign achieves success much like my first one it will allow us to do more specialty footwear in the future.  Our plans will focus on disabled and mentally challenged individuals who want comfortable footwear that have easy on easy off capabilities but aren't cheap in material or function.</li>

<p>Our potential with each campaign aims to reach further and dig deeper into what we can do.  You can help yourself while assisting us in getting to that point.</p>

<p>The Fun Stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li>Like every campaign we are transparent throughout from A-Z letting you know the process as well as expectations..</li>
<li>We learned from our past campaign the perks were the product. Timely, functional and great price-point. Those who back this campaign will get discounted pricing on this particular choice of shoes that we are offering.</li>

<h3>The Impact and Your Help Is Needed</h3>
<p>Why you are crucial to this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>This project will need at LEAST 2000 people to pledge or 2000 pairs to be purchased in all</li>
<li>Why? Because when you work with factories there are minimum order requirements in order to keep the production costs low.  Without the ability to make 2000 pairs, we can not reach our goal.</li>
<li>We honestly think if everyone globally assists in sharing this project we will more than exceed our goal.</li>
<li>ROCKDEEP INC. isn't a fly by not company, having done our first crowdfunding on KickStarter it propelled us to a growing company that has made great strides in only two years.</li>
<li>We put our companies name on the line that you not only LOVE these products you will wish you had purchased a few pairs (which at the price we offer you'll be able to do).</li>

<p>Our only risk to this is it going far beyond what we imagined it.  We have done wear testing, we have done development of both offerings and all that is left is to produce them.  <br/><br/>We only see one obstacle or struggle and thats not having FULL participation of EVERY single person supporting this assisting us spread this all over the world via your social media platforms.  We won't be enough.

<p>Well, to put it simply, JoeyPac has those feelings of nostalgia that we love, and just don't get from many other brands.

</div></div>","Our Story
Hello Indiegogo family! We are JoeyPac™, an accessories & apparel design brand based in Los Angeles, CA. We're so excited to share our first product, the 2L Venture Bag, and with your valued support, we'll continue to create FUNctional products for you to enjoy on your errands & endeavors.
Now that we've moved into production after our successful Kickstarter campaign (http://kck.st/3veF2AF), we're looking to keep our momentum by offering our product here! Using Indiegogo's inDemand platform allows you to continue placing orders while the bags are being produced, letting our small operation focus on marketing and getting our website polished. Our Kickstarter marked the official launch of our brand, so we're extremely appreciative that you're interested in our journey this early on!
 

 
The Venture Bag is a carefully reimagined fanny pack/bum bag/sling bag with functionality to free your pockets of the modern essentials, and features that make charging your device easier. Its 2L capacity is the perfect size to wear every day and also accompanies you on any outing. All three colorways will make you want to venture out, and our eye-catching liner designs will make you look within...
Our meticulous attention to detail forced us to consider all things while developing this bag; practicality, quality of materials, aesthetics, and most importantly, how the bag makes you feel. We hope we've made something you can thoroughly enjoy and proudly wear.
  

(Above: An all black outer and watercolor + neon-noir-inspired liner makes up our 'After Midnight' colorway.)
 

(Above: Taking you back to the '90s with our 'Retrograde' colorway!)
 

(Above: Our 'IncogNeato' colorway was inspired by camouflage and we added some color pop with safety orange features!)
 

 
Why JoeyPac?
Well, to put it simply, JoeyPac has those feelings of nostalgia that we love, and just don't get from many other brands. It's what we associate our brand with that gives us that lasting impression: adventure, no matter how small! There's just something about confidently hopping out your front door knowing your contents are secure inside a bag you're happy to wear, and that you're ready for whatever's ahead!

The quick release mechanism holds tight onto your keys. Both tabs have to be pulled back to release the keys. BACKER TIPWe got a great tip from a backer.  Always loosing your access badge at work? King Pin can help you keep it secure. Those cheap plastic ones IT gives you always break.Extra pins are available for extra sets of keys. At Tallac House we believe products should do one thing and do it really well. We spend the time to make sure it functions great and is long lasting.  This is our third Kickstarter project.Learn more about us at TALLAC HOUSEGet your King Pin today.  Hey got extra sets of keys can I get addtional Pins?  Yes, after you add your perk there is an ""Add On"" perk so you can get extra pins. TUCKED INSPECFICATIONS

The reason for using <strong>Stainless steel,</strong> as it is much stronger than <strong>Aluminium</strong> and less brittle than <strong>Sapphire</strong> and <strong>Ceramic</strong>. </p><p>Ion Plating (IP) is physical vapour deposition process, where surface required to be plated is bombarded forming a <strong>Titanium Nitride</strong> layer.</p><p>Ion plated surfaces are five to eight times more durable and resistance to corrosion and wear.

For Turret 300M, we mount the rotating bezel slightly beneath into the watch case, like the U.S.S Monitor Turret.</p><p>With this design, the rotating bezel is protected by the 4 angular sides of the watch case and at the same time the rotating bezel is prevented from accidentally move or rotate.

Now, we are proud to announce launch of our second campaign, Turret 300M. 





 
Turret 300M, dive watch design concept is inspired by an “Iron-Clad” naval warship, U.S.S Monitor.Its warship technology was state of the art during its era, which transformed and revolutionized naval warfare till today.U.S.S Monitor new design iron-hulled ship structure was totally different from the early “Iron-Clad ship at that time.It neither had a masts nor Port/Starboard (Left/Right) line of cannons.A 360-degree rotatable large cylindrical turret with 2 internal cannons was mounted in the middle of the ship. While other warships needed to maneuver to its target in line with its onboard port/starboard cannons to fire. U.S.S Monitor could instantly rotate its turret and fire instantly at its enemy.Beside the turret, U.S.S Monitor had other innovative inventions onboard its ship, including a new compact steam engine and a below deck head (toilet) that could flushed below the water line. These naval warfare technology and inventions were the most advance during its era.

 
Similar to The U.S.S Monitor, we, MMI Watches, try our best to inject innovative design elements into our watches. When most watchmakers play it safe when it comes to watch design, we want every part of the watch’s design to be unique and stand out from the rest.For Turret 300M, we injected 3 innovative design elements into the watch. Special Date Display, Ion Plated (IP) Stainless Steel Bezel and Turret Style Watch Case:- SPECIAL DATE DISPLAY: For those who got bored of conventional date display on their watch, have a look at our “New Date Display” design. This design made it both functional and more aesthetically pleasing. ION PLATED (IP) STAINLESS STEEL BEZEL INSERT:Another experimental project by MMI Watches. We tried using a Ion Plated (IP)Stainless Steel Bezel Insert on Turret rather than a traditional Anodized Aluminium Bezel Insert. Once again we were astonished by the end result. The effects came out far better than we anticipated.The Blue Stainless Steel Bezel Insert changes its colour from LIGHT BLUE - BLUE - DARK BLUE - BLACK depending on the environment lightings. The reason for using Stainless steel, as it is much stronger than Aluminium and less brittle than Sapphire and Ceramic. Ion Plating (IP) is physical vapour deposition process, where surface required to be plated is bombarded forming a Titanium Nitride layer.Ion plated surfaces are five to eight times more durable and resistance to corrosion and wear. When Ion Plating is combined with Stainless Steel, the result is a heavy-duty item that withstand the rigors of daily use. TURRET STYLE WATCH CASE:Most traditional dive watches have its rotating bezel mounted flat onto the watch case. For Turret 300M, we mount the rotating bezel slightly beneath into the watch case, like the U.S.S Monitor Turret.With this design, the rotating bezel is protected by the 4 angular sides of the watch case and at the same time the rotating bezel is prevented from accidentally move or rotate. This is especially important when you use the bezel as timing instrument for your dive.THE DIAL : OLD MEETS NEWThe Turret 300M dial is given an ultra fine horizontal brushed finish, which is identical to previous debut model, Dumbo 500M. With this textured finish, the dial is able to present two tones, dark and brillant effects, depending on the enviromental lighthings.We have also injected a new innovative “Date Display” to the dial, giving it a functional and more aesthetically pleasing look. TURRET MOVEMENT Why SW200 and NH35 movements?The answer is obvious - the best of both worlds (28.8kph/4Hz & 21.6kph/3Hz).They are the most reliable, versatile and robust movements on the market. Both companies have long history in watch movements manufacturing, which they have perfected over the years. 1) SELLITA SW200This movement needs no introduction as SW200 is well known to every watch lover. The SW200 is precise, reliable and robust. Its quality and reliability are comparable to ETA 2824, some may even say SW200 is better. 2) SEIKO NH35Another popular movement used in many dive watches. NH35 is well known for its reliability. It can outlast Swiss movement with minimum or no servicing. Swiss Super-LumiNova®We understand the importance of the dials and markers on the watch face and bezel. They have to be legible under water and in low light conditions.Full night legibility of our watches is achieved by using the best phosphorescent pigment on the market, Swiss Super-LumiNova®. Our watches are coated with Swiss Super-LumiNova® C1 Grade X1 / Old Radium Grade X1 / BGW9 STD.There 4 collection for all backers to choose from.Blood Red & Ocean Green will be produce specially for Kickstarter / Indiegogo Backers and MMI Watches Website Customer Pre-Order Only. 316L STAINLESS STEEL PACKAGE:  Package Include:1 x Turret 300M (With Steel Bracelet)1 x  PU Leather Watch Roll1 x Tropic Rubber Strap1 x Warranty Card (1 Year) DLC PACKAGE:  Package Include:1 x Turret 300M (With Brown Genuine Leather Strap)1 x  PU Leather Watch Roll1 x Tropic Rubber Strap1 x Warranty Card (1 Year) All prices stated on the Rewards Section is inclusive of shipping charges.

<p>Here at Grainz we are passionate about two things; looking good, and giving back to the environment.  Thats why we offer stylish shades that come with a tree seed for you to plant.  We do this to help give back above and beyond what we took to make our sunglasses.  This gives YOU the chance to see the difference you are making and help sustain our renewable resources.   Giving you the seed instead of planting a tree for you gives you the chance to feel connected to the movement we are trying to start.</p>

<h3><strong>A 'lil bit about Emma &amp; Ji Ji Kiki</strong></h3>
<div>
<a href=""http://www.jijikiki.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Ji Ji Kiki"">Ji Ji Kiki</a> is an independent online store which sells cute and vintage inspired clothing, jewellery and accessories.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Ji Ji Kiki started in part whilst at university, when I sold vintage items on a certain auction site to help fund my studies (and keep me in gig tickets and books!).</div>
<div>After I graduated I set up <a href=""http://www.jijikiki.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""jijikiki.com"">jijikiki.com </a>and I began selling my own line of handmade, vintage inspired jewellery alongside vintage pieces and have since then expanded into selling jewellery handmade by other indie designers, clothing, bags and accessories and a small homewares range..
<p>I am a one person business, which is fantastic as it means I can provide a personal service to each and every customer, but does mean that in order to take Ji Ji Kiki to the next level I need to look to funding and this is where you come in!</p>
<h3><strong>What Ji Ji Kiki Needs &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>I want to make Ji Ji Kiki the best place to go to get cute and vintage inspired clothing. The funding I receive will go towards two different parts of the business; increased ranges of products and website functionality.</p>
<p>I adore vintage inspired fashion and currently stock a small range of dresses. Due to customer demand I would love to expand my range of clothing to sell other products (tops and skirts) as well as being able to stock a range of clothing beyond the current sizes we offer.</p>
<p>One part of the funding will be used to purchase new items and increase the product ranges currently available, to be able to offer all my customers dresses, tops and skirts.</p>
<center><img alt=""dresses"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c85/Jellycat797/dresses.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></center>
<p> </p>
<p>The second part of the funding will go towards website development, to be able to offer users a better browsing and purchasing experience with, amongst other features, a mobile website, wishlist feature and easier navigation.</p>
<h3><strong>Perks!</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>I really do appreciate any help you are able to give to help Ji Ji Kiki and there are different items (or 'perks') on offer as my way of saying 'thank you'! Everyone who donates will get a shout out on the blog (unless you would like to remain annonymous!).</p>
<p>All of the perks available are listed on the right and there are some pictures below showing the Limited Edition necklace locket, Cosmic Glitter Necklace, tote bag and examples for the Necklace of the Month Club.</p>

After I graduated I set up jijikiki.com and I began selling my own line of handmade, vintage inspired jewellery alongside vintage pieces and have since then expanded into selling jewellery handmade by other indie designers, clothing, bags and accessories and a small homewares range..
I am a one person business, which is fantastic as it means I can provide a personal service to each and every customer, but does mean that in order to take Ji Ji Kiki to the next level I need to look to funding and this is where you come in!
What Ji Ji Kiki Needs & What You Get


I want to make Ji Ji Kiki the best place to go to get cute and vintage inspired clothing. The funding I receive will go towards two different parts of the business; increased ranges of products and website functionality.
I adore vintage inspired fashion and currently stock a small range of dresses. Due to customer demand I would love to expand my range of clothing to sell other products (tops and skirts) as well as being able to stock a range of clothing beyond the current sizes we offer.
One part of the funding will be used to purchase new items and increase the product ranges currently available, to be able to offer all my customers dresses, tops and skirts.

 
The second part of the funding will go towards website development, to be able to offer users a better browsing and purchasing experience with, amongst other features, a mobile website, wishlist feature and easier navigation.
Perks!


I really do appreciate any help you are able to give to help Ji Ji Kiki and there are different items (or 'perks') on offer as my way of saying 'thank you'! Everyone who donates will get a shout out on the blog (unless you would like to remain annonymous!).
All of the perks available are listed on the right and there are some pictures below showing the Limited Edition necklace locket, Cosmic Glitter Necklace, tote bag and examples for the Necklace of the Month Club.

We found some brands use the size of the waist as the size of the pants, but many other brands used different sizing, usually label size is little smaller than real measurements.</p><p>We follow the practice of the latter.

These days, many people seem to find the solution with the slim, minimalist wallet and there are hundreds of brands and products in the market.</p><p>If the pants are the least, last and non-separable 2nd skin of the men, the pants pockets are also the least, last and non-separable transport tool of the men.  That is the reason, we believe, the pants pockets should carry smartphone, wallet and EDC essentials as comfortable, convenient, light as possible.</p><p>RenoPocket Chino is the answer and the solution to these problems. By spreading the thick EDC essentials in a wider space and dividing in the partitions, bulging is removed or lessened, mixing, poking, scratching and entanglements are prevented. You can use the old, hearty wallet with least bulge.</p><p>There are maybe  other ways, too.</p><p>But if you want your hands and shoulders free, if you don’t want to carry a separate bag, if you don’t want to push the protruding bulge forward, there are not many choices.</p><p> </p><p>Refunds</p><p>We reserve the right to issue or deny any requested refunds.

Please bear in mind the color of your imagination and the color of the delivered chino can be little different. SIZE:Front rise sits little higher to lift the upper inside pocket.Please remember the size of the pants and the size of the waist is not same.  As you realize the sizing is different from brand to brand. We found some brands use the size of the waist as the size of the pants, but many other brands used different sizing, usually label size is little smaller than real measurements.We follow the practice of the latter. Before deciding your size, we recommend you to measure your real size and compare with your present pants size. RenoPocket Shorts:Same size as chino but inseam: 11 in (28cm) Problems:When you see the pants in the show window, they do not show how you will look if you put on that pants. The pants look just smart and handsome when they do not carry any EDCs in their pockets.But EDCs are not the matter of style or choice, they are the matter of survival, indispensable.The moment I put those EDCs in the pocket, the pants look different, I feel different.In the meantime, the smartphone gets bigger and bigger while the pants pockets remain same and people have been asking each other how/where you are carrying your big smartphone. Some kind of outpockets or hidden pockets are installed, but still the smartphone bulges, sticks and rubs to the thigh, pulls down like a weight.Wallet (even not very fat bifolder) bulge has been another headache of the pants style for long time. You can find pages of discussions on how you should tackle this problem. These days, many people seem to find the solution with the slim, minimalist wallet and there are hundreds of brands and products in the market.If the pants are the least, last and non-separable 2nd skin of the men, the pants pockets are also the least, last and non-separable transport tool of the men.  That is the reason, we believe, the pants pockets should carry smartphone, wallet and EDC essentials as comfortable, convenient, light as possible.RenoPocket Chino is the answer and the solution to these problems. By spreading the thick EDC essentials in a wider space and dividing in the partitions, bulging is removed or lessened, mixing, poking, scratching and entanglements are prevented. You can use the old, hearty wallet with least bulge.There are maybe  other ways, too.But if you want your hands and shoulders free, if you don’t want to carry a separate bag, if you don’t want to push the protruding bulge forward, there are not many choices. RefundsWe reserve the right to issue or deny any requested refunds. If we issue a refund, we will deduct 10% if the amount had already been taken from your pledge as the fees for the payment processor and Indiegogo. International BackersWe ship internationally to select countries.All international shipments are subject to duties, taxes and clearing fees which you are responsible for paying.

Once abandoned, we can not ship another package  to you or issue a refund. Please check the import procedure and expenses of your customs and postal service  carefully before you pledge.Risks and challengesOur factory is well experienced in manufacturing the world brand pants. We don’t see any problems if our order meets their minimum requirements. For any unexpected issues, we promise to be transparent and we will let you know on any possible delays.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

I due mescolano la passione di Federico per la moda, il cinema, la musica, la street art e quegli sport dallo stile unico come il surf e lo skateboard a quelle per la fotografia, l’arte e il disegno di Brunella. </p><br/><p></p><a href=""https://instagram.com/RicoRulesBrand"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p></a>Mentre lavorano si rendono conto che le loro passioni e il loro stile erano condivisi da un gran numero di amici che in qualità di artisti, fotografi, modelli vengono invitati a dare il loro contributo al progetto. Si va formando così una vera e propria <b>community</b> di persone che condividono gli stessi interessi e lo stesso stile. Dopo più di un anno di duro lavoro il risultato finale è un prodotto interamente italiano di alta qualità, con alcuni particolari veramente innovativi quali l’<b>etichetta in microfibra</b>.  <a href=""https://instagram.com/RicoRulesBrand"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><br/><p></p>

Every single graphic
of our sweatshirts and t-shirts reflects the passion for movies, music and art, in order to let us to express who we are and everything we like.
                     
                     
     
Many experts take care of the manufacturing of our
products, which is completely made in Italy. They have worked hard
to give you the perfection. The idea of Rico Rules was born during the first months of  2013 and at beginning it was just for fun. It came from two guys, Federico (Founder) and Brunella (Art Director)  who want to share their passion with the world. They merged their creativity and started this project. The concept was to express what they like through a t-shirt.  Federico’s passion for fashion, cinema, music, street art and all that sports like surfing and skating has been mixed with Brunella’s passion for photography and drawing. In developing the idea, they realized that Rico Rules could have been a way for a lot of people to express themselves. The project has been developed also thanks to the contribution of a lot of friends: they helped a lot in quality of artists, photographers and models. So the result is that a community made of people with same passion is born. After more than a year of hard work we have developed a high quality product completely made in Italy, with some particularities such as the microfiber label.All t-shirts and sweatshirts have a special functional label in microfiber you can use to clean your sunglasses. That's cool! You can use it when you are
on the beach or whenever you want. But if you want, it also can be removed it
from the shirt.  Both men and women’s t-shirt have been studied in detail and they have cuffed sleeves and a slim fit to let you be always fashionable.Our 2014 collection will have : men and
women’s t-shirt and unisex sweatshirts. All the products are made 100% by high
quality cotton. The entire  manufacturing process,
from fabrics choice,  cutting, to the
final printing, is completely made in Italy. Serigraphy has been used as
printing tecnique; it provides brilliant and durable colours. Have a look to all the photos in the Indiegogo gallery related to our project.

Arte e moda da indossare, questo è Rico Rules!                   Ogni singola grafica delle felpe e delle t-shirt traduce su un capo d’abbigliamento la passione per il cinema, per la musica e per l'arte in generale, con lo scopo dichiarato di esprimere ciò che siamo e tutto quel che più ci piace.                                                  La produzione, rigorosamente made in Italy, è affidata ad esperti del settore ed è curata sempre nei minimi dettagli, affinché la qualità del prodotto sia impeccabile.






L’idea di Rico Rules nasce quasi per gioco durante i primi mesi del 2013 e nasce dal desiderio di due giovani ragazzi, Federico (Founder) e Brunella (Art Director) di dare voce alle loro passioni. Insieme, i due, uniscono la loro creatività e iniziano a dare vita a Rico Rules. L’idea di base era appunto quella di esprimere attraverso una semplice t-shirt i loro interessi e il loro stile. I due mescolano la passione di Federico per la moda, il cinema, la musica, la street art e quegli sport dallo stile unico come il surf e lo skateboard a quelle per la fotografia, l’arte e il disegno di Brunella. 





Mentre lavorano si rendono conto che le loro passioni e il loro stile erano condivisi da un gran numero di amici che in qualità di artisti, fotografi, modelli vengono invitati a dare il loro contributo al progetto. Si va formando così una vera e propria community di persone che condividono gli stessi interessi e lo stesso stile. Dopo più di un anno di duro lavoro il risultato finale è un prodotto interamente italiano di alta qualità, con alcuni particolari veramente innovativi quali l’etichetta in microfibra.  




Tutte le T-shirt e felpe hanno una speciale etichetta in microfibra che puoi usare per pulire, in tutta sicurezza, i tuoi occhiali da sole.  Non è fantastico? Puoi usarla quando sei al mare o in qualsiasi altro momento. Se però dovesse infastidirti puoi sempre rimuoverla facilmente e portarla sempre con te
separatamente. 

sia la t-shirt maschile che femminile
sono curate nei minimi particolari, inoltre presentano delle maniche risvoltate
e una vestibilità slimfit per essere sempre alla moda.
La nostra collezione 2014 presenta due modelli di t-shirt: femminile e
maschile. Le felpe invece saranno unisex. Entrambi i
prodotti sono in cotone 100% di alta qualità. L'intero processo, dalla scelta
dei tessuti, al taglio, alla stampa finale è interamente MADE IN ITALY . La
tecnica di stampa adottata è la serigrafia che assicura colori vivaci, duraturi
nel tempo e lisci al tatto.

<p><strong>BEWARE THE BLOOD MOON SUPER ECLIPSE!</strong></p>
<p>While there is time! We are developing custom *for this special event* protective Blood Moon Lunar Eclipse glasses for your supernatural safety.</p>
<p>You survived last year's Total Solar Eclipse by using protective glasses. But are you prepared for the epochal event of January 31st, 2018??? It is the third and final of a dreaded TRIPLE SUPERMOON sequence.  This is truly a once in a lifetime event to be commemorated (with protective eye glasses!).</p>
<p><strong>We want you to safely enjoy the coming Super Blood Moon Lunar Eclipse!</strong></p>
<p>NASA has kept silent about what protection it is giving astronauts during the Blood Moon Eclipse, but we do know this: Direct sunlight contains about 100,000 lumens of intensity. The Full Moon projects 1/100,000th that amount. The Blood Moon eclipse could be 1/10,000th of even that intensity. With so many numbers involved, its clear that you need BLOOD MOON ECLIPSE GLASSES. Our glasses will give nominal safety against photons, UV rays, X-Rays, Sting-Rays and evil spirits emitted from the eclipse. </p>

<p>Backstory: I am a science teacher at the San Jose Conservation Corps Charter School. This project is the idea of one of my students, Gloria Plancarte. One of the most rewarding moments as a teacher is to spot talented minds and give them a boost. Gloria is exactly that kind of talented mind. In December, we were discussing how there would be three consecutive supermoons, capped off by a lunar eclipse -a Blood Moon. We laughed about how there would probably be “end of the world” warnings like there were for the total solar eclipse last August. Everyone else just laughed, but Gloria suggested making a fun business out of it. </p>
<p>So here we are. </p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476844733/kzhajeyubdumgkai4bvb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Gage Timepieces began a little over two years ago when I was reading a men's magazine. There was an advertisement for a luxury watch. The ad featured some movie star leaning casually against a vintage car looking off to some new adventure off screen. I loved the watch but thought that I would never take that watch on a road trip.</p>
<p>I immediately decided that the world needed a heirloom quality watch that will do what high end watches once did: Go out into the field. Climb mountains, descend to the ocean floor.</p>
<p>The relationship between men and machine shouldn't mean that a cherished watch goes into a collection and only get brought out for New Year's parties. When it gets passed on to your children, your watch should have some character that tells stories to tell about where you have been.</p>
<p>I believe that technology has made our world bigger, not smaller. A century ago your dreams would end at the edge of your small farming town. Now, you can be anywhere in the world in 24 hours, doing anything you want. Your only limitation is how big you can dream. And when you get there you will need a rugged watch. It won't hurt if your timepiece looks awesome too.</p>
<p>Thanks to the rise of crowdfunding I am able to make my dream a reality and send you on your travels with the very best watch I can design.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Watch</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The Gage Worldtimer is a modern casual design that doesn't abandon traditional design, it drop-kicks it. Thanks to its patent pending lugless design, the watch will feel smaller than it's 43 mm case would suggest. The double crowns feature a double o-ring design to keep your watch water resistant to 100 meters or 330 feet. An internal bezel rotates to set to your current timezone and let you know at a glance how many hours ahead or behind you another city is: prefect for coordinating business calls to other countries or just keeping in touch with your friends and family across the country. The crystal is 2.5 mm thick sapphire, one of the hardest materials known which will resist scratches keeping a clear view of the watch dial for years.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476995757/odrlufywtm5zof8ygdo1.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The hour and minute hands as well as the applique indices are coated in superluminova which allows you to tell time late into the night by their bright glow.</p>
<p>The heart of the watch is a Sellita 200 automatic Swiss movement that is powered by the swing of your arm. The technology of automatic movements has been perfected and is the soul of every high end luxury watch on the market. While your smart watch will be worthless and outdated in a few years the automatic watch is timeless.  Rather that the rough ticking of a quartz movement, the second hand on an automatic sweeps seamlessly over the dial. With no toxic lithium batteries, the Worldtimer is more environmentally friendly and your watch will never die at a bad time. With periodic maintenance few years by a watchmaker, your Worldtimer will continue ticking for your children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>The Worldtimer is available in three variations to fit your personality and wardrobe: </p>
<ul>
<li>oxblood dial with black leather strap</li>
<li>onyx dial with a rich brown leather strap</li>
<li>navy blue dial and matched leather strap</li>
</ul>
<p>All variations can be upgraded in the perks to include an Italian rubber band, spare set of pins and pin removal tool with your watch so that you can protect your leather strap from the effects of water, sweat or mud.</p>
<h2>The Gage Serpent</h2>
</div><div>
<p>People ask me what the logo featured on the dial and movement rotor is. Here is the story.</p>
<p>My dad built a sailboat in his mom's backyard when he was a young man and the serpent was a design he painted on the bow.

<p>But the lie became a real legend. My dad was just a blue collar metal worker but with hard work and dedication to his dream he eventually sailed his boat on three voyages across the Pacific ocean to many tropical paradises and back.</p>

We just released our first image of the new International Campaign.
! exclamation


This is the name of our brand new fashion line. And this is our logo. We've been working in the fashion industry since ever and now it just came out to be the perfect time to release our own fashion brand. But we wanted to make something that was a real strong meaning of quality, high quality, both for the designs and the materials we are going to use.    The Old Italian Tradition



 That's what inspired us since the beginning. The old memories of moms and grammas, sitting on a couch doing fashion. They didn't know they were holding in their hands one of the ancient secrets of the italian traditions. Of course they had no trendy designs planned on a table of a famous art director. They just did fashion for the family. All the family. When we opened this company I wanted to make sure that the same tradition, the same good taste and huge level of quality would have been protected. 
Tailor Made Fashion







That's the extraordinary service we want to give to every client.The innovative way we see the fashion industry today: working on tailor made clothes.We can guarantee a 5 days + shipping delivery. All our clients will place orders online and with the orders they send us their own sizes.In 5 days the clothes are ready for the shipping and we can guarantee a worldwide delivery in 2 days. 





  The Goal We have already 3 people working full time on the new designs both for wool and for the cotton projects. But we need at least 3 more. We already invested around $45,000 for the company registration, 3 employees, the rent for the warehouse and a couple of instruments but we really need more.We are taking it by steps. The very first step is connected to the funding request of this campaign. But further funding will be more than welcome, considering to open the Spring summer 2015 collections very soon and a representative and delivery office in the USA as well within January 2015.The money for the first step would be for: 1 - Two iMac for the graphics and the designs2 - One iMac to manage the online store3 - Instruments for the production steps4 - Cottons - different types and colours5 - Wool - different types and colours 6 - Software for the Store and for the online store7 - Packaging
We started producing hats, gloves, shirts, pulls, scarfs and clothes for kids but if we can reach the goal we can start for teens and grown-ups too, both male and female, with a full collection.

 
The Materials

The quality of the materials we use is not something we accept to deal around. We only work with the best wool and the best cottons available. That is not making us the cheapest company on the market, but we are not born to be the cheapest, we want to be the ones you remember for the quality. 

The Store

<p>If met, the funding goal of $5000 will be put directly towards the mass production of the stockings. Because they'll be produced in bulk, the price per pair drops significantly, hence the low prices for you guys.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3>Funding</h3> <ul>
<li>When full 
funding is reached, the first stretch goal will become available as an 
additional purchasable perk, as well as a free addition to everybody who
 orders the Sock Buddies perk or higher. Afterwards, new stretch goals 
will be announced as each previous goal is met, and each new design will
 be added FREE OF CHARGE to Friendship Pack supporters.<br/>
</li>
<li>Please spread the campaign as much as possible! More funding 
means more stretch goals, which means more socks for everyhorse! Use the
 tools on the top of the page, or simply share the URL wherever you've 
got friends. You have friends, right? Right?<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>No Funding<br/>
</h3>If the campaign isn't fully funded, nobody will be charged anything. But then the stockings won't be made. How terrible. :( That's why it's so important we reach our goal. If 
the campaign is over-funded, addons will become 
available. With the addition of these additional designs, the production
 time will increase slightly, possibly causing delays in delivery, but 
ultimately providing a better product.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h3>STRETCH GOALS</h3>

 tools on the top of the page, or simply share the URL wherever you've 
got friends. You have friends, right? Right?



No Funding
If the campaign isn't fully funded, nobody will be charged anything. But then the stockings won't be made. How terrible. :( That's why it's so important we reach our goal. If 
the campaign is over-funded, addons will become 
available. With the addition of these additional designs, the production
 time will increase slightly, possibly causing delays in delivery, but 
ultimately providing a better product.STRETCH GOALS


FULL FUNDING: THE STOCKINGS WILL BE MADE! You get all the socks you pledged for! They'll become tangible, physical objects that you can hold in your hands and wear on your legs.



$7,500: The Sun Horse and Moon Horse designs (concepts below)
 will become available as extra stretch goals, and will be added to any Friend Pack order free 
of charge.



$10,000 (concepts coming soon): Music Horse Duo Pack! Choose your side, Classical or Electronic. Why not take both?


FURTHER STRETCH GOALS (TBA):  Princess & Pretender Duo Pack!

<p>It all started in 2017. We began as a marketplace to promote a wide range of vegan fashion products that were on-trend and also ecological, but we soon noticed the lack of good quality vegan belts on offer. Traditionally, belts are made from leather or 100% PVC, which often use animal-derived glue. </p>
<p>You're also limited to one style, a hip or waist belt, not the Voodism way. We set out to create a belt that could be worn on the hip and waist and everything in between. A functional design, styled by you, our very first Voodism belt collection.</p>

<p>Our focus was to make the perfect belt and we didn’t want to limit the design in any way. Although it’s vegan, it’s not limited to vegans: it’s for everyone.</p>
<p>Our first belt range is crafted from a green PU made with renewable sources, 48% of which are derived from the corn plant. Supported by an inner layer of FSC certified cork and held together by 100% plant-based glue, making it not only durable but green to its core.</p>
<p>It’s also designed to be reversible, so you can choose from two colours, and it fits both at the waist and hip, making it a truly versatile accessory for the wardrobe.</p>

<p><strong>CYCLING FUNCTION</strong></p>
<p>Every detail on this jacket has been considered to make urban cycling as comfortable as possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>14x4 Lumen waterproof LEDs on front &amp; rear, visible 400m away</li>
<li>Up-to 14 hours battery life on a single charge</li>
<li>USB charged lithium polymer battery pack</li>
<li>Dropped hem to keep you covered on the bike</li>
<li>Additional sleeve length for comfort when in riding position</li>
<li>Zipped pocket closures in waist and chest pockets</li>

<li>High performance fabric providing water resistance and breathability</li>
<li>Moisture wicking mesh lining </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WATER RESISTANT</strong></p>
<p>The Clissold Bomber jacket has been made using Schoeller® 3XDRY® performance fabric, meaning the outside of the jacket is water, dirt and stain repellent and any moisture on the inside is quickly absorbed and evaporated away from the body, keeping you dry and comfortable on the bike.</p>

<p>All LUMO garments have been designed to look as good off the bike as they do on it. We offer a casual, tailored fit that is comfortable for cycling in, whilst providing a relaxed look off the bike. Both men’s and women’s jackets are sized based on average height and build and designed to go over two lightweight layers like a top and a jumper. If you will be wearing heavy layers underneath, we recommend you size up one size on your normal choice. All our garments have been made with additional length in the sleeves and back to offer comfort whilst in the riding position.</p>

<p><strong>UNISEX STYLES</strong></p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","*As featured on the BBC Apprentice*
LUMO provide urban cyclists the optimum blend of style, visibility and comfort, on and off a bike. Following a successful Kickstarter campaign in December 2014 to launch our debut collection, we have come back to crowdfunding to introduce our latest release that has been 12 months in the making. 

Inspired by the military issue MA-1 flight jacket, the Clissold Bomber has been adapted for life on the bike and is the perfect crossover from cycling specific clothing to stylish outerwear.


CYCLING FUNCTION
Every detail on this jacket has been considered to make urban cycling as comfortable as possible:

14x4 Lumen waterproof LEDs on front & rear, visible 400m away
Up-to 14 hours battery life on a single charge
USB charged lithium polymer battery pack
Dropped hem to keep you covered on the bike
Additional sleeve length for comfort when in riding position
Zipped pocket closures in waist and chest pockets
High ribbed collar for wind protection
High performance fabric providing water resistance and breathability
Moisture wicking mesh lining 

WATER RESISTANT
The Clissold Bomber jacket has been made using Schoeller® 3XDRY® performance fabric, meaning the outside of the jacket is water, dirt and stain repellent and any moisture on the inside is quickly absorbed and evaporated away from the body, keeping you dry and comfortable on the bike.


 

VISIBLE 400 METRES AWAY
Ultra high brightness waterproof LED lights run down the front and the back of the jacket and are visible to traffic up to 400 metres away. Positioned in the most visible location on the body, the lights will last up to 14 hours on a single charge and are USB rechargeable.



The lights are powered via a lightweight USB rechargeable lithium polymer battery pack that sits neatly in an inside pocket and will last up to 14 hours on a single charge.  
 

 

All LUMO garments have been designed to look as good off the bike as they do on it. We offer a casual, tailored fit that is comfortable for cycling in, whilst providing a relaxed look off the bike. Both men’s and women’s jackets are sized based on average height and build and designed to go over two lightweight layers like a top and a jumper. If you will be wearing heavy layers underneath, we recommend you size up one size on your normal choice. All our garments have been made with additional length in the sleeves and back to offer comfort whilst in the riding position.
For more information on sizing and how to measure yourself, click here.

UNISEX STYLES
The Clissold Bomber jacket is a unisex style, meaning the cut is exactly the same for men as it is for women, but womens sizes are slightly shorter in the arms and rear hem than mens. 
CARE AND WARRANTY 
We offer a free lifetime repair service. We offer a 12 month warranty from the time of delivery and will replace or repair any faulty product within that period, as well as offering lifetime repair outside of warranty. To find out how to care for your LUMO product and operate the lighting system, have a read of our user manual.





 
The Full package includes two items from our current collection, the Bermondsey Backpack and Camden Polo:



Since launching, LUMO has had coverage in mainstream, technology and cycling media.



With the experience of the last campaign behind us, no stone has been left unturned in delivering the Clissold Bomber. Everything from manufacturers to packaging and fulfilment is already in place, and we have a team of people with the knowledge, skills and experience to deliver. We understand how long the product will take to manufacture and when we will be able deliver it to our backers who wish to pledge and be the first people to receive the Clissold in the world.

<h3>COLOR</h3>
<p>Depending on the backed number of jackets we want to offer them in as many colors as possible. Basically, the more you back and the more you share this campaign, the more variations you can choose from :)<br/>Of course, you can even give us more inspiration. For now we have the following colors:<br/>Black, Dark Brown, Light Grey, Blue, Red, Light Blue/Coral, Neon-Yellow, Pink.<br/>Even single color versions are possible.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481153001/hgowsq4qmrwg6abjmfrg.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We will ask every backer for their desired color combo and hopefully we reach the number to satisfy every wish. THE FIRST 30 BACKERS WILL GET THEIR DESIRED COMBO OUT OF THOSE 8 COLORS ANYWAY!!! So maybe YOU get an UNICUM! You better hurry!<br/>There will be at least 5 combinations each male and female version.</p>

<p><br/><br/><strong>Our Story</strong></p>
<p>Ever since we got our dog it has always been kind of inconvenient having a walk with him. There were so many items to think about. At the end we always had a whole bag of stuff taking with us. </p>
<p>In fact, there are a handful of sellers of dog owner jackets, but they are either not very fashionable or they simply just have two extra pockets but that's it. As seen in the video.</p>
<p>With our background in fashion design we created this ultimate patent pending jacket which leaves nothing to be desired. Super modern design meets functionality!</p>
<p><br/><strong>Why Indiegogo?</strong><br/>Your pre-orders will help us to aim a competitive production price. Obviously we need a certain number of jackets to make them affordable.<br/>And of course, your feedback is very valuable to us!</p>

FASHION
Besides the functionality of this jacket we paid high attention on the look. A modern cut paired with the latest colors and material, this softshell jacket stands out at places.Our background in fashion design guarantees you a top modern jacket.
Even when you are without your best friend!


 
COLOR
Depending on the backed number of jackets we want to offer them in as many colors as possible. Basically, the more you back and the more you share this campaign, the more variations you can choose from :)Of course, you can even give us more inspiration. For now we have the following colors:Black, Dark Brown, Light Grey, Blue, Red, Light Blue/Coral, Neon-Yellow, Pink.Even single color versions are possible.
We will ask every backer for their desired color combo and hopefully we reach the number to satisfy every wish. THE FIRST 30 BACKERS WILL GET THEIR DESIRED COMBO OUT OF THOSE 8 COLORS ANYWAY!!! So maybe YOU get an UNICUM! You better hurry!There will be at least 5 combinations each male and female version.

Our Story
Ever since we got our dog it has always been kind of inconvenient having a walk with him. There were so many items to think about. At the end we always had a whole bag of stuff taking with us. 
In fact, there are a handful of sellers of dog owner jackets, but they are either not very fashionable or they simply just have two extra pockets but that's it. As seen in the video.
With our background in fashion design we created this ultimate patent pending jacket which leaves nothing to be desired. Super modern design meets functionality!
Why Indiegogo?Your pre-orders will help us to aim a competitive production price. Obviously we need a certain number of jackets to make them affordable.And of course, your feedback is very valuable to us!


Thank you for sharing!

<p>Picture this:  You get home and have only minutes to get ready to go out.  You pick out a dress <i><b>but don’t
have a nail polish to match</b></i>.  Do you:</p>
<p>a).<span> 
</span>Choose another dress based on the
nail polish colors you have on hand</p>
<p>b).<span> 
</span>Quickly run to the
store, and buy a color that maybe goes with your dress</p>
<p>c).<span> 
</span>Go bare or mismatched</p>
<p>d).<span> 
</span>Decide to create your own.</p>
<p>I chose d).</p>
<p>I believe in dressing well and having matching accessories but
found it frustrating and expensive to constantly buy dozens of commercial nail
polishes just to match specific outfits. 
The color would never be right or go with the dress I was going to wear
for a particular occasion.  It was then
that a light bulb went off!!!  What if I
could create my own?!  And that’s how Rungh was conceived!</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>We are looking to raise
the funds for inventory, production, and expansion. Our ability to raise the
funds will enable us to expand our production capacity, launch new lines, and negotiate better
terms with the suppliers and our shipping partners so we can offer the product
to all of you at the lowest possible price.</p>
<p>We are offering to our donors first dibs to own, flaunt, and use the Rungh System before it is available
to the general public. Plus you will have the ability to offer your input for
the next version, including preferred colors to be launched in refill color pack
sets. </p>

<p>The Rungh Nail Polish System was
inspired by seeing the hundreds of colors that you can get with paint. By using just the right color combination mixed into a paint base, you can have an endless array of colors for your walls. 
So, we felt that we wanted to empower consumers with the same choices of
selecting their own colors and creating new shades using combinations of color
pigments without having to settle for a color or shade available at a store at
that point of time. </p>
<p>Now, for the first time ever, you can create a
nail polish color to match your dress or mood, and that too, in under a minute.

</div></div>","What is the Rungh System? 
Picture this:  You get home and have only minutes to get ready to go out.  You pick out a dress but don’t
have a nail polish to match.  Do you:
a). 
Choose another dress based on the
nail polish colors you have on hand
b). 
Quickly run to the
store, and buy a color that maybe goes with your dress
c). 
Go bare or mismatched
d). 
Decide to create your own.
I chose d).
I believe in dressing well and having matching accessories but
found it frustrating and expensive to constantly buy dozens of commercial nail
polishes just to match specific outfits. 
The color would never be right or go with the dress I was going to wear
for a particular occasion.  It was then
that a light bulb went off!!!  What if I
could create my own?!  And that’s how Rungh was conceived!
   What We Need & What You Get 
We are looking to raise
the funds for inventory, production, and expansion. Our ability to raise the
funds will enable us to expand our production capacity, launch new lines, and negotiate better
terms with the suppliers and our shipping partners so we can offer the product
to all of you at the lowest possible price.
We are offering to our donors first dibs to own, flaunt, and use the Rungh System before it is available
to the general public. Plus you will have the ability to offer your input for
the next version, including preferred colors to be launched in refill color pack
sets. 


So how do you get your hands on a set like the one above? Five easy steps: 
1) Click contribute now, and the link will connect you to either just contribute $s or choose the Rungh Nail Polish System kit by clicking on a perk at $30 or higher.
2) Next, click continue to payment, and it will take you to PayPal.

<p><b>Why this Project?</b></p>
<p>A year ago I
decided to buy a new camera bag. I was looking for something that would not
only protect my equipment, but would also look stylish, casual and distressed.
I was disappointed to find that most of the bags designed to carry photographic
equipment have a lot of room for improvement when it comes to aesthetics and
looks. I decided it was the time to create my own bag, an appealing beautiful
bag that would protect my equipment.</p>
<p><b>What makes Ortenca Bags so special?</b></p>
<p>We worked on
the perfect bag to our standards through almost one year. There were over 50
designs made and many materials to assess in order to find the perfect design.
We are sure you’re going to love them!</p>
<p><b>Can these bags protect my photographic equipment
like traditional bags?</b></p>
<p>Yes! Ortenca
Bags are designed to protect your camera and photographic equipment. Featuring
waterproof canvas and a special isolating anti-shock material, Ortenca Bags are
designed to protect your equipment from shock and the elements.</p>
<p><b>How do I
choose my perfect size?</b></p>
<p>The Ortenca
Bags are available in 2 sizes:  </p>
<p><b>TheMini: </b>An everyday stylish and practical light camera bag,
perfect for the city and daily photographic escapades.</p>
<p><b>Ortenca15: </b>A beautiful comfortable bag, capable of fitting a
complete photographic equipment set, including a 15” laptop. It’s perfect to be
taken as hand luggage when travelling by air.</p>
<p><b>Are Ortenca
available in other colours or styles?</b></p>
<p>Currently,
Ortenca Bags are only available in chocolate. However, we plan to broaden our
collection with new colors and designs. Follow us to get updates and the latest
news about Ortenca Bags!</p>
<p><b>What are you going to do with the money you raise?</b></p>
<p>We already
have the designs, fabric, leather and materials. We have constructed several
prototypes and have finally gotten to our final design, but we still need €5000
to get this project going.</p>
<p>Help Ortenca
Bags succeed and we’ll return the favor by sending you an amazing camera bag at
a much lower price than you would ever find at a store.</p>
<p>Once we reach
our goal, we’ll make your bags and ship them as quickly as possible. Any
additional funds raised will go towards the production and expansion of our
current line to include new colors, designs and sizes, as well as a few
surprises to come.</p>

stylish accessory with a vintage/hipster look to it.Note: Our bags are currently
available at a special launch price at Indiegogo. Select a perk on the right to
pre-order your Ortenca Bag.
Ortenca is
defined by stylish fashionable high quality camera bags. We have dedicated 11
months to designing over 50 camera bags, as well as researching and testing
materials until we finally came up with the perfect bag.

We have designed two Ortenca Bags
models. A small bag, to carry on a casual photographic escapade, and a large
bag to carry a photographic equipment set including a 15” laptop.
Both models are made out of high quality leather with vegetable waterproof tan
colored canvas. The leather is treated to have a naturally aged look. The
canvas has wax treatment to make a semi-rigid waterproof bag to protect your
equipment against the elements.
The interior compartments are fully
customizable to suit your needs and fit the contents of the bag like a glove.
Both bags are covered with a thick layer of insulating material to protect the
equipment against shock and drops. 
We use reinforced ergonomic padded leather straps designed to easily carry the
weight comfortably. Our bags are thoughtfully designed to the finest detail, such as our logo engraved in leather both on the strap and a small panel in the lower right corner of the bag.
The bags feature high quality metallic and magnetic parts
for closures and clasps, finished in a beautiful aged color. The magnetic
clasps have been carefully designed to provide comfortable easy access to the
contents of the bag.

We have designed each bag to be stylish and practical, with
waterproof flaps to protect the equipment from rain and snow. It features
several pockets and compartments to store batteries, chargers and caps.

An innovative fashion 24h watch making yourself exclusive and different.

""Can we change the usual perception of time ?""

As designers, we always have to reinvent ourselves to reinvent the world we live in.
We are Benjamin and Maxime, two young designers from the You&Me Design Agency in Bordeaux (France) and we decided to change our relation to time.
Vasco Watches intend to bring up a totally different way to read Time with an innovative concept: a 24h hand-free watch, crafted with the best of french savoir-faire. Time precision is about 15 minutes.
This new collection of watches is designed in the highest accuracy in term of details and finishes, but also in term of concept and newness.
After a year of project conception, working prototypes are ready ! We're making this crowdfunding campaign in order to make Vasco come true: we need you.

Vasco Watches souhaite amener une façon totalement différente de lire l'heure grâce à un concept innovant: une montre 24h sans aiguille, fabriquée avec le meilleur du savoir-faire français. La précision est de l'ordre de 15 minutes.
Cette nouvelle collection de montres a été conçue avec la plus grande attention en terme de détails et de finitions, ainsi que sur l'intention de nouveauté et de concept.
Après un an de travail de design et de conception, les prototypes fonctionnels sont prêts ! Nous avons mis en place cette campagne de crowdfunding afin de réunir assez de fonds pour lancer Vasco en série et que ce projet devienne réalité: nous avons besoin de vous.







Vasco Watches doesn't really exist yet as a company. We know that with your help, this can be true very soon. We conceived the watches from the sketches to the final prototypes. It means Vasco can be produce in a short delay. 

You have the opportunity to invest into our project by getting the watch before everyone. 
First 50 backers will have a bigger discount, a letterpress giftcard for Christmas and a numbered watch ! Time to choose the good one.
Vasco Watches n'existe pas encore réellement en tant qu'entreprise. Nous savons qu'avec votre aide, cette idée pourra devenir réalité très bientôt. Nous avons conçus ces montres depuis les premiers croquis jusqu'aux prototypes finaux. Ce que nous voulons dire, c'est que Vasco peut être produit en peu de temps.
Vous avez l'opportunité d'investir dans notre projet en achetant la montre avant tout le monde.
Les 50 premiers acheteurs auront une remise plus importante, une carte de Noël en letterpress et une montre numérotée ! Il est temps de choisir la bonne.

After the campaign there is production and distribution. Instead of walking into a store, purchasing and leaving with a good you are purchasing a product and at the same time helping to create a new company. Instead of bringing on a single investor you fund the company by selling to individuals that are interested in your product and would like to see it succeed!

Mens sizes 7-15 available and they run in whole sizes with medium width. If you wear a half, order the size down.- Some common questions about the campaign: What is a pledge? - Because your ""pledge"" or purchase is what funds the company it is considered a pledge instead of a purchase. You are pledging in exchange for the item selected. - If total goal is not reached all pledges are returned to individuals.  You WILL either receive your product or your money - August shipping....really?  This one is tough and nobody wants to get these out sooner than I do. After the campaign there is production and distribution. Instead of walking into a store, purchasing and leaving with a good you are purchasing a product and at the same time helping to create a new company. Instead of bringing on a single investor you fund the company by selling to individuals that are interested in your product and would like to see it succeed! It's about buying a product and at the same time contributing to a worthwhile cause and you receive a discounted price for doing so. -The process consists of metal molds being made for each size.- Final production sample made for each size.- 1500+ shoes manufactured.- Shipped to ocean liner.- Freight shipped by barge over ocean.- Sorted, boxed and final distribution in the U.S.Although it's a structured process it still does require a decent amount of time allotment.-The initial launch color scheme is black and red.

Hi! We're Miami Watch Company (MWC). We are a team of horology masters and creative designers from sunny South Florida.Between all managing partners, there is approximately 20 years of combined professional experience in watchmaking and design. We’ve been manufacturing watches and developing individual watch components for other companies and individual entrepreneurs for many years.We have multiple watch brands, the most successful of them all being Amir Watches. We’ve decided to launch Viperidae watch series through crowdfunding to allow our clients to help us bring this work of art to life and create a tradition of quality & unique watchmaking. Our next project is to bring one of our own timepiece creations to life and we are confident that our background, creative drive and meticulous attention to detail will result in a quality product. But we need your help!
 
 



Miami Watch Company 
pursued 3 objectives:
 To assemble watches that reliably serve their main purpose to always display a precise time;
 To apply meticulous attention to every detail that would make our timepieces durable and classy;
 To keep the watches affordable 
 
Through endless trial and error, combinations of materials and technologies, we have finally found a perfect balance between quality and price. The result is the Viperidae Watch Series. 
Mounted with scrupulous attention to every detail, Viperidae Watch Series are created to fulfill the requirements of those who are looking for an intelligent purchase and are able to appreciate the functionality and craftsmanship of our timepieces. Our watch collection is a perfect combination of powerful and reliable technologies. 
  

We have named our series after specific snakes since we share common characteristic. Both are vicious, relentless and uncompromised. 


MWC incorporates these attributes into the design of our timepieces, included in these five options:






 
Each strap has a unique number so that everyone will be able to specify exactly which strap they would like with their watch when placing an order.
 

  
 




 
 
Case

3 parts case, 316L surgery steel
Solid screw down caseback, 42mm Diameter
Bezel – 2 step
Crown – screw down “onion” crown
Scratch resistant Sapphire crystal that allows an optimum clarity of the dial (9 moh hardness)
Sapphire crystal with double anti reflective coating inside, rotatable reflector ring made of ceramic and filled with Vintage Super Luminova.
Waterproof – 20ATM
Mechanism

Self-winding Automatic NH35 movement
Functions – central hour, minute and seconds hands
Dial

High gloss finishing, applied indexes filled with Vintage Super Luminova
3 Hands filled with Super-Luminova: Hour, Minute, Second
Bracelet

Heavy duty canvas strap and several other leather 
Strap options are available which you will be able to select prior to your purchase
Stainless steel dornbuckle
 

 

All of our past experience has been with the development of key watch components for other corporate and individual clients. After many years of producing quality timepieces for others, we have finally decided that it is time for us to bring one of our own to life. We have launched a line of classic timepieces called Amir Watches which currently is in high demand in Central Asian countries.
 
These images illustrate the Renderings vs. Actual Photos of the watches. As you can see, there is little to no difference whatsoever between the renderings that we envision and the final product which we produce. As part of the standard process we always start with prototypes and produce working samples for our watches. 



 

All watches purchased from the Miami Watch Company come with a 24 month manufacturer’s warranty. This warranty covers material production defects concerning the watch, strap and movement. It does not cover damage caused through misuse or physical force. Your warranty will be valid from the date of purchase and need to be registered in our database through this form.
  

We will be using the funds that we raise to execute our first production run! We highly value our customers’ trust in us and, therefore, will be constantly updating this campaign with the latest news of the process!

Storing a weapon for home defense has always been a trade-off between safety and accessibility...until now. With Instant Access IPS (In Plain Sight), you no longer have to choose between securing your weapon and being able to access it quickly in an emergency.  
Our security cabinets offer a secure, locked enclosure for you to store your tactical home defense weapons or handguns. They can be accessed quickly with a simple, user programmable, 3-8 digit code. You don't even have to sacrifice your home decor, as our cabinets rest behind a tasteful piece of artwork. 
 

Why are we conducting this campaign?



Launching a new product is never easy.  There are startup costs, production minimums, volume pricing agreements, and numerous other barriers to bringing a new product to market.  We've been making and selling our tactical weapons ""in-wall"" cabinet for almost a year and a half.But a number of our supporters either do not own their own homes or are otherwise not in a position to install one of our in-wall solutions.  So we have developed a pistol cabinet that mounts on the wall rather than in the wall.  With the Pistol Cabinet, anyone who needs to safely secure their handgun but still have almost immediate access to it has that ability.  Whether you are a renter or just don't want to cut into your drywall, the Pistol Cabinet offers a great solution.  Using drywall screws and drywall anchors, the Pistol Cabinet installs in just a few minutes.But in order to make the Pistol Cabinet more affordable, we need to have a large first production run.  That's where you come in.  Whether you are just donating, buying some of our awesome swag, or pre-purchasing a cabinet (or two or three), you are helping to make our new product a reality.  Without your help, this product does not exist. How they work


The unit uses 8 AA batteries to power a user programmable micro-controller.  Press the grey button on the printed circuit board and input your customized 3-8 digit code.  One beep confirms that your code has been accepted (two beeps indicates your code is either too long or too short).  Now every time you enter your code, the electronic solenoid locks release and the cabinet opens.  Type in the wrong code and you will hear two beeps.  The electronic solenoid locks are self-retracting, so no need to input the code to close the unit.  There is a keyed override should the electronics fail or the batteries run down.  Typical battery life is greater than one year under normal usage. 


       


Are there size considerations?


Yes.  While the unit has been designed to accommodate most semi-automatic handguns, some are just too long or too wide (think Desert Eagle).  Max length is about 8 3/4 inches.  Max height is about 9 inches.  Max width is 1 9/16 inches.  The non-marring pins are adjustable laterally to provide a custom fit for most pistols. [Note: the depth restriction eliminates many revolvers so please measure yours before ordering]

</div> <div> <ul> </ul> </div> </div></div>","The story.... - My name is Jiri and when I was 19 I decided to go to study abroad - Denmark. As you might think, it is one of the most expensive country for living, so my begging as an unemployed foreign student wasn't easy. During my stay in Denmark I found out two things. Danish people like luxury clothes and fitness. I decided to build up a team and create a High-end sport brand because  there is nothing like premium sport brand in the current market.- We set up a clear rules in the beginning of this project which are: High quality of the clothes, exclusivity, unique design, functional gadgets, serial number of each product, glossy wooden boxes for our products, certificate of authenticity with serial number, special fragrancy of the products and much more... We were working hard on the designs of the clothes (cooperation with  fashion school of Paris), boxes and certificates, registration european trademark and we are just about to finish the prepared e-shop. - Currently we are at the last stage of the project. We have the wooden boxes, certificates, prepared webpage but the only thing we are missing (the most important) are the CLOTHES.



What We Need & What You Get-We need 7000 USD to order 5 kinds of clothes for men (T-shirts, sweatshirts, sweatpants, undershirt and shorts) and 5 kinds of clothes for women (T-shirts, sweatshirts, fitness bras, leggings, shorts)-You might be interested why only 10  kinds of clothes in general? Because that is our uniqueness. Every product will be sophisticated to the smallest detail. We bring you not only the product but also a feelings.-After receiving requested amount, we will contact our supplier which will make the products for us, deliver it to Denmark, we will photoshoot it on our models and put it on the website.-If you support us, with 10 USD, your name will be mentioned in the official page as a supporter. If you will send us 100 USD you will get 30% discount on one product by your choice after opening the e-shop. 200USD you will get 40% discount on one product by your choice. 300USD you will get 50% discount on one products by your choice. -Everybody who will help us with more than 100 USD will get to its product letter of thanks with signature of CEO and whole team.We are....We are not like other luxury
brands. We are focusing entirely on sports clothing.This means that Jack de Rossé takes
your experience from exercising to the next level. We don’t want you to only
feel and look good, we want you to show everyone else who you really are.Don’t feel ashamed for your
success, embrace it and tell the world around you that you got what it takes to
be on top.You are a winner and you want to show others
your status. We will help you to do that. Specialization - flexibility-We are ready to adapt our products to the customer needs. Our customer is our boss. For example if there will be muslim people interested in, we are ready to make products for them. Our advantage is flexibility but we keep our rules.

Risks & Challenges
-If you are an entrepreneur, there is always
risk of failing. Since 2014 we were observing Scandinavian people,
asking them a questions and majority of them said, that it is a great idea,
that they are missing premium sport brand for sport. -Another evidence is, that if you visit local fit center, you will see people wearing high-end brands in the gym even though, that the clothes are casual, just because they want to show their classiness. 
Designs
-We are designing your products via photoshop. Currently we cooperate with fashion school of Paris on designs and functionality of our products.

<p><b>OUR STORY</b></p>
<p>Hi! We are Ina &amp; Albert, the founders of wundaland.</p>
<p>We started wundaland with the vision to bring fine jewelry, with our unique design to life at a fair price without compromising on quality.</p>
<p>Your pledge will help us to produce a first small series of 100 items per design. This is the minimum number we need to produce to be able to offer you the jewelry at these prices.</p>
<p>We have spent years to find the best and most talented goldsmith and to develop a process that allows a detailed re-creation of the beauty, individuality and richness of nature.</p>
<p>Unlike luxury jewelry brands we do not mark up the gold and diamond raw material price of up to 500%.</p>
<p>We’d be thrilled if you be part of this journey and help us with your contribution to bring the magic of wundaland to life.</p>

OUR STORY
Hi! We are Ina & Albert, the founders of wundaland.
We started wundaland with the vision to bring fine jewelry, with our unique design to life at a fair price without compromising on quality.
Your pledge will help us to produce a first small series of 100 items per design. This is the minimum number we need to produce to be able to offer you the jewelry at these prices.
We have spent years to find the best and most talented goldsmith and to develop a process that allows a detailed re-creation of the beauty, individuality and richness of nature.
Unlike luxury jewelry brands we do not mark up the gold and diamond raw material price of up to 500%.
We’d be thrilled if you be part of this journey and help us with your contribution to bring the magic of wundaland to life.







DESIGN
It begins with the founders vision of beauty that is brought to life through the model of nature. All bracelets, earrings, pendants and brooches are one of a kind and reflect the uniqueness and individuality of nature.  
Our goldsmith has developed a secret and complex process to recreate the detail and individuality of nature at the highest level.
CRAFTSMANSHIP
""Our family has a long tradition in creating jewelry for the leading luxury brands around the globe.""
All our jewelry is 100% made in
Germany in one of the oldest and most traditional goldsmith towns.  Our
factory supplies the world's top luxury jewelry brands and shares our passion
for perfection and highest quality products
MATERIALS 
We use the best of the best: 18k
gold, 18k rose gold, cold enamel and anthilope leather.


PRICE  We work with the same materials, goldsmiths and

My name is John and I’ve been a leather goods enthusiast since I was a kid. I have been designing leather products since 2015 with a goal of including style and function into each one. Along with my co-founder we were tired of being disappointed by overpriced and underbuilt shoes that do not include additional features or cost a premium to add. Often using cheaper and inferior leather and other raw materials. We found that many others felt the same and decided to start our own leather goods brand.</span></p>
<p>John Candor came to life during a trip to Colombia while visiting family and friends. With our desire to start our own leather goods brand and wanting to help the local economy, it was a perfect match. We are committed to supporting them with our business and other post conflict community-building initiatives. Over the past years we have invested thousands of dollars and countless hours into fine tuning and creating our products. We continue to innovate and develop new designs so that you too can enjoy unique artisan crafted leather goods without having to break the bank.</p>

We want every customer to love their John Candor shoes as much as we do, and we proudly stand behind our products, never take shortcuts, honor our commitments, and admit when we can do things better. Our business approach is to be straightforward, unreserved, and sincere. We are passionate about creating and providing our customers with exceptional products that are excellent in quality, responsibly produced, &amp; sustainable for future generations. We pay higher prices to get the right materials to use when we design and create each shoe, then pass on savings to you by going ‘direct-to-consumers’.</p>
<p>Each of you can help us continue to bring this project to life. Every pair goes a long way! Shoes you can feel great about buying and wearing. We hope to WOW you with our products so that you will feel enthusiastic about joining our adventure and bring others along.</p>
<p>John Candor is a Veteran owned, small family business based out of Dallas, Texas that is partnered with third generation leather artisans in Medellin, Colombia. We are simple guys and two friends who enjoy time with family and friends, new adventures, sharing good food and playing soccer on the weekends.</p>

<h2>Our Goal, Mission and Vision</h2>
<p>We exceeded our minimum order quantity (MOQ) funding goal on Kickstarter by raising $47,789 USD! But this is just the start and to be able to do this full time we need to keep the momentum going. We have poured our lifesavings into this with the dream of making this our life’s work.</p>
<p>You can be one of the first to wear John Candors! We are offering our shoes at a 30% discount. All backers on Indiegogo will then receive an exclusive 25% off or greater on our other products. </p>
<p>John Candor’s initial launch date was planned for May 2020, but when the covid-19 pandemic struck, all our raw material factories were closed by end of March. We had no idea if they would reopen or not. Thankfully, they did by the end of 2020. Many small businesses were crippled, especially in countries where government support was limited or non-existent. Colombia was no exception, leaving family businesses treading water and fending for themselves. Our partners pivoted to making masks so they could stay afloat financially and keep all their employees and contractors working. They are now ready to get back to making leather goods!</p>
<p>This project is an opportunity to revive many families hopes and dreams while pursuing the craft they love.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>Our Impact in Colombia</h2>
<p>At John Candor we take great pride and personal ownership of not just every product we make, but in HOW every product is made. Over 50 families, many of whom are single mothers and heads of households, contribute to bring our products to market and they are equally entitled to happy, balanced, and satisfying lives. We are not successful unless they partake in that success. We will never compromise their wellbeing for a profit margin and ensure each one receives fair pay with benefits, training opportunities, and safe working conditions.</p>
<p>Our certified leather tanners incorporate on-site water treatment plants that recycle, purify, and reuse the water needed for the curing and tanning process. With over one million+ USD invested into these plants any unused water is returned to its original source in an even cleaner state. They also assist local communities with treating and purifying their wastewater as to minimize their environmental impact.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>We are bringing this product to life during a worldwide pandemic while businesses and factories have been closing. This brings with it a series of unique challenges, especially regarding the availability of materials, worker's welfare, social distancing measures, and international shipping delays.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we are greatly confident that we can accomplish all of this since we have spent thousands of man hours doing our homework, working on, analyzing, and fine-tuning our production process! Our third-generation artisan shoemakers will deliver a premium product and we have been running successful ecommerce businesses since 2015. During which we have learned many valuable lessons along the way pertaining to international markets, manufacturing, and project delivery. We know how to take our prototypes from the design phase and successfully carry them through to project execution and delivery.</p>
<p>Although we do not foresee any hold ups, if there are any delays in production, we will contact you right away with an updated completion date!</p>

<p>Our shoes are made per standard US sizing. When choosing your size, stick with your usual dress shoe size. John Candor Shoes are available from US Men's size 6.5 to 15. Wide sizes are available in ""E"".</p>
<h2>Measuring Guide</h2>
<p>We recommend you measure your foot length (from heel to longest toe) in Cm or Inches, add .5"" / 1.27cm and identify your correct shoe size from the chart above. You can also use the Brannock Device (that metal scale you put your feet on at any shoe store).  </p>
<p>If your foot length in inches or centimeters is right at the boundary between sizes, we generally suggest that you choose the size up for a looser, more relaxed fit.</p>

</div></div>","Hi! My name is John and I’ve been a leather goods enthusiast since I was a kid. I have been designing leather products since 2015 with a goal of including style and function into each one. Along with my co-founder we were tired of being disappointed by overpriced and underbuilt shoes that do not include additional features or cost a premium to add. Often using cheaper and inferior leather and other raw materials. We found that many others felt the same and decided to start our own leather goods brand.
John Candor came to life during a trip to Colombia while visiting family and friends. With our desire to start our own leather goods brand and wanting to help the local economy, it was a perfect match. We are committed to supporting them with our business and other post conflict community-building initiatives. Over the past years we have invested thousands of dollars and countless hours into fine tuning and creating our products. We continue to innovate and develop new designs so that you too can enjoy unique artisan crafted leather goods without having to break the bank.



Candor is a straightforward, honest, and sincere expression in how we run our business and bring our products to life. We want every customer to love their John Candor shoes as much as we do, and we proudly stand behind our products, never take shortcuts, honor our commitments, and admit when we can do things better. Our business approach is to be straightforward, unreserved, and sincere. We are passionate about creating and providing our customers with exceptional products that are excellent in quality, responsibly produced, & sustainable for future generations. We pay higher prices to get the right materials to use when we design and create each shoe, then pass on savings to you by going ‘direct-to-consumers’.
Each of you can help us continue to bring this project to life. Every pair goes a long way! Shoes you can feel great about buying and wearing. We hope to WOW you with our products so that you will feel enthusiastic about joining our adventure and bring others along.
John Candor is a Veteran owned, small family business based out of Dallas, Texas that is partnered with third generation leather artisans in Medellin, Colombia. We are simple guys and two friends who enjoy time with family and friends, new adventures, sharing good food and playing soccer on the weekends.

<br/><h2>Risks and challenges</h2>
<p>We've taken every step to ensure that we have a successful launch for Umbrella Here. We have brought our Umbrella Here digital prototype that we have built with Arduino to Shenzhen, China, the manufacturing capital of the world. In Shenzhen, we found a product designer and an electronic engineer to help us work on Umbrella Here to make it ready for manufacturing.</p>
<p>Once we met the engineers and product designers who helped us on our project, we have told them that Umbrella Here has to fit different umbrellas. This is definitely one of the biggest problem we encountered. Right now, our product designers had came up with different designers, where we can ensure that Umbrella Here fits different Umbrellas. Right now, we are under the process of trying out which looks and work best on Umbrella Here. Please expect that we might add something into the hole of Umbrella Here in our final product, which will help Umbrella Here fit different umbrellas.</p>
<p>Please be aware that every Umbrella Here comes with a wooden stand. The four of us are currently based in Hong Kong and all of our manufacturing will be done in Hong Kong or Shenzhen. We are still currently undergoing the process to check which countries do not allow us to mail a wooden stand. If we encountered any problem of sending out the wooden stand to you, we will changed the stand to other materials. Don't worries, if anything changes, we will definitely contact you.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""color: #196d64; background-color: initial;"">THE QUALITY MATERIALS<br/></span></h2>
<p><b>Hemp Strap: </b></p>
<p>Hemp fiber is one of the strongest and most durable natural textile fibers on earth. It's not only strong, but it is also known to hold its shape very well.  As a fabric, hemp provides all the warmth and softness of other natural textiles but with a superior durability seldom found in other materials. Natural organic hemp fiber ‘breathes’ well and is biodegradable. </p>
<p><b><b>E.V.A Footbed:</b></b></p>
<p>EVA is a dense foam which acts as an excellent and durable shock absorber for your feet. EVA has the advantage of being 100 % recyclable of all production waste, which means that no waste is achieved while producing Zlopz from the material. EVA is free of chlorides, heavy metals, phenols, latex and all toxins. EVA actually stands for Ethylene Vinyl Avetate and is a polymer widely used in a number of applications. The reason EVA is considered more eco-friendly is that it doesn't use chlorine in its production. This means there is less toxicity released during degradation in a land fill somewhere, if your Zlopz accidentally wind up there. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Recycled EVA Foot-bed material is considered even more eco-friendly, because not only is the material itself environmentally safer, but it is likewise not being simply discarded and is instead being re-used again and again. EVA is also widely used in Vegan shoes because it is man made and animal friendly. </span></p>
<p><b><b>100 % Natural Rubber Latex (NRL) Sole:</b></b></p>
<p>It's durable, biodegradable and has great natural elasticity.</p>
<p>Al(OH)3 treated NRL is all natural and renewable, contains <span>no VOCs, is free of known or suspected carcinogens and non-toxic and is the most environmentally safe way to use Natural Rubber that is free of allergens.</span></p>
<p>Natural rubber is so great, it allows you to spread our prints, on your feet. </p>

<h2><span style=""color: #196d64;"">THE BIG IDEAS LIST </span></h2>
<h4>(so far)</h4>
</div></span>
</div>
<p>1) Using drones to protect Rhinos by alerting rangers of nearby poachers.</p>
<p>2) Create a yearly ""Cash Prize"", that will be awarded to the individual or team that showcases the best conservation idea for each endangered animal.</p>
<p>3) Create an educational Virtual Reality app, that utilizes the Google Cardboard platform, to immerse users in an amazing educational experience with endangered animals. By utilising new technologies, we think this could create an everlasting impression in the minds of humans and shift the mindsets of a generation. If you have ever experienced VR before, you will understand the possible implications of this type of education. Then, convince Google to making this a default app on all Android devices :)</p>
<p></p>
<p>4) Establishing <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaponics%C2%A0systems"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">aquaponic</a> farms in starving villages, to create a self sustaining food source for their communities. By feeding the hungry, we can take away the necessity of poaching for meat.</p>
<p>5) Create an open sourced game, where you take part in an amazing human scientist program that will provide information to actual scientists, to save endangered animals. The more human scientist there are, the more we know. The more we know, the more we can do to combat extinction. </p>
<p></p>
<p>6) ""I fear that we may be too late to help the oceans maintain their ability to absorb carbon dioxide. But there is something we can do—and it could make the whole difference and buy us time to develop the necessary low carbon economies. We can halt the destruction of the world’s rainforests—and even restore parts of them—in order to ensure that the forests do what they are so good at—in other words storing carbon naturally. This is a far easier, cheaper and quicker option than imagining we can rely on as yet unproven technology to capture carbon at a cost of some $50 per tonne or, for that matter, imagining we can achieve what is necessary through plantation timber"" — <a href=""http://todayinsci.com/C/Charles_Prince/CharlesPrince-Quotations.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Charles, Prince of Wales</a></p>
<p>(Presidential Lecture, 3 Nov 2008, at the Presidential Palace, Jakarta, Indonesia)</p>
<p>7) We could stop deforestation by employing humans to protect the rainforests in the Amazon. Imagine if we could convert the humans who are cutting the trees down, into tree saving environmentalists. Maybe, we could save Mother Natures lungs. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">   </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">8) Try to STOP the buying of endangered animal products, by educating </span>communities<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">. We think if the buying stops, the killing stops. </span></span></p>
<p>9) Your idea could be HERE: __________________________________________________</p>
<p>____________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>____________________________________________________________________________</p>

<div>
<p><b></b></p>
</div>
<p><b>Why do I want a pair of Zlopz so bad?</b></p>
<p>That's because they're well priced, good quality sandals, that leave awesome prints in the sand AND the're just as good as the best sandals on earth except, we use 50% of our profits to protect endangered animals and you think that's pretty rad? </p>
<p><b>When do I get to pick the Zlopz I want?</b></p>
<p>Once the campaign has ended, we'll be able to get the right tooling to create the best sandals we can possibly make. Once we have finalized the prototypes, you'll get an email that will show you exactly what the final products are going to look like. After you've decided which pair you LOVE the most, you'll get to choose the size you want. If we're lucky and reach our goal of $500,000, you'll also have the option of choosing Kidz Zlopz. </p>
<div>
<b>If I choose the “Herd of Zlopz” perk, can I choose different sizes and types of Zlopz?</b><p>Indeed, you can choose from 6 different sizes, 6 different types and whether they're for a male or female human being. </p>
<p><b>What if Zlopz do not reach their funding goal?</b></p>
<p>We are running a fixed funding campaign so, if we don't reach our target, we won't receive any of the funds and we'll be super bummed! </p>
<p><b>Can I place an international order?</b></p>
<p>Yes. If you live outside North America, Europe, South Africa or Australia please add:</p>
<p> $20 to your order if you ordered 1 pairs of Zlopz. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">$30 </span><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">to your order if you ordered 2 pairs of Zlopz.</span></p>

<p><b>How does Zlopz manage their Marketing Footprint?</b></p>
<p>Zlopz takes every effort to minimise our footprint, not just when making our products, but always. Our campaign relies heavily on digital platforms to minimise the usage of natural resources, and we are working flipping hard to ensure that we keep our footprint to an absolute minimum whenever we can. However, we do not claim, nor do we think it is achievable at this time, to create awareness and engagement of so many people on environmental issues with a zero footprint, but that is our aim.</p>
<p><b>How will backers be involved in the environmental voting process?</b></p>
<p>You decide which animal you want to support AND you will have a say in how we go about saving that animal. After our campaign has come to an end, you will get to cast your vote on which BIG Ideas, you think we should get behind, to protect the animal that you have chosen.</p>
<p>One vote for every pair of Zlopz you purchase. </p>
<p><b>Where can I pre-order Zlopz after the campaign has closed?</b></p>
<p>On our homepage - <a href=""http://www.zlopz.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.zlopz.org</a></p>
<p><b>Why the name Zlopz?</b></p>
<p>Z = <u>last</u> letter in the alphabet and </p>
<p>2015 = our <u>last</u> chance to save some of these endangered animals. </p>

Where 50% of our profits 

will be used to protect the most incredible animals in the world 

and you get to help us decide how!

Humans are heating up the planet like they have a spare one lying around. We think that it will get so hot one day, that the only thing humans will be able to wear are sandals.



So we're making 





Made from the most environmentally awesome materials! 
Together, we can use crowdfunding to change the way we do business!

We're going back to the earth.

THE HERD












THE QUALITY MATERIALS
Hemp Strap: 
Hemp fiber is one of the strongest and most durable natural textile fibers on earth. It's not only strong, but it is also known to hold its shape very well.  As a fabric, hemp provides all the warmth and softness of other natural textiles but with a superior durability seldom found in other materials. Natural organic hemp fiber ‘breathes’ well and is biodegradable. 
E.V.A Footbed:
EVA is a dense foam which acts as an excellent and durable shock absorber for your feet. EVA has the advantage of being 100 % recyclable of all production waste, which means that no waste is achieved while producing Zlopz from the material. EVA is free of chlorides, heavy metals, phenols, latex and all toxins. EVA actually stands for Ethylene Vinyl Avetate and is a polymer widely used in a number of applications. The reason EVA is considered more eco-friendly is that it doesn't use chlorine in its production. This means there is less toxicity released during degradation in a land fill somewhere, if your Zlopz accidentally wind up there. Recycled EVA Foot-bed material is considered even more eco-friendly, because not only is the material itself environmentally safer, but it is likewise not being simply discarded and is instead being re-used again and again. EVA is also widely used in Vegan shoes because it is man made and animal friendly. 
100 % Natural Rubber Latex (NRL) Sole:
It's durable, biodegradable and has great natural elasticity.
Al(OH)3 treated NRL is all natural and renewable, contains no VOCs, is free of known or suspected carcinogens and non-toxic and is the most environmentally safe way to use Natural Rubber that is free of allergens.
Natural rubber is so great, it allows you to spread our prints, on your feet. 

COMFORT
Besides just looking AWESOME, Zlopz will be unbelievably comfortable too! 
We want you to wear them everyday, they have to be comfortable!
PS: Think you know of alternative materials that will make Zlopz even more eco-friendly and comfortable?

The more we learn, the more we want to change everything.

SO HERE'S THE DEAL
Crowdfunding is changing the world, dramatically! 
For the first time in history, anyone can fund their amazing ideas over the internet. At the current rate, Crowdfunding is expanding so fast ($65 Bil - 2014) that these new businesses will play a huge role in our future economy.
We now have the most amazing opportunity to change the fundamental way in which businesses operate, for the good of the planet.

Because life shouldn't just be about the profits.




SO WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?

You decide...


Humans are way cleverer than animals, so we figured:

1) Submit your ideas to myawesomeideas@zlopz.org 
2) Vote for your favorite ""BIG Idea""
3) We'll use 50% of our profits to make the best ideas a reality!



THE BIG IDEAS LIST 
(so far)


1) Using drones to protect Rhinos by alerting rangers of nearby poachers.
2) Create a yearly ""Cash Prize"", that will be awarded to the individual or team that showcases the best conservation idea for each endangered animal.
3) Create an educational Virtual Reality app, that utilizes the Google Cardboard platform, to immerse users in an amazing educational experience with endangered animals. By utilising new technologies, we think this could create an everlasting impression in the minds of humans and shift the mindsets of a generation. If you have ever experienced VR before, you will understand the possible implications of this type of education. Then, convince Google to making this a default app on all Android devices :)

4) Establishing aquaponic farms in starving villages, to create a self sustaining food source for their communities. By feeding the hungry, we can take away the necessity of poaching for meat.
5) Create an open sourced game, where you take part in an amazing human scientist program that will provide information to actual scientists, to save endangered animals. The more human scientist there are, the more we know. The more we know, the more we can do to combat extinction. 

6) ""I fear that we may be too late to help the oceans maintain their ability to absorb carbon dioxide. But there is something we can do—and it could make the whole difference and buy us time to develop the necessary low carbon economies. We can halt the destruction of the world’s rainforests—and even restore parts of them—in order to ensure that the forests do what they are so good at—in other words storing carbon naturally. This is a far easier, cheaper and quicker option than imagining we can rely on as yet unproven technology to capture carbon at a cost of some $50 per tonne or, for that matter, imagining we can achieve what is necessary through plantation timber"" — Charles, Prince of Wales
(Presidential Lecture, 3 Nov 2008, at the Presidential Palace, Jakarta, Indonesia)
7) We could stop deforestation by employing humans to protect the rainforests in the Amazon. Imagine if we could convert the humans who are cutting the trees down, into tree saving environmentalists. Maybe, we could save Mother Natures lungs.     
8) Try to STOP the buying of endangered animal products, by educating communities. We think if the buying stops, the killing stops. 
9) Your idea could be HERE: __________________________________________________

PLANTATION STATION





(Packaging)



Once our packaging has safely transported your Zlopz, you can plant a tree in them, because they're awesome that way.



      



ESTIMATED SHIPPING DATE



June 2015 






 



FUNDING - $72,000

In order for us to get our feet off the ground, we have to place an order of reach a minimum order quantity of 1600 pairs of sandals for all 6 pairs of sandals. Only then will any manufacturers take a couple of animals seriously... So we need your help to show them that we mean business! 






THESE ARE THE SIZES

Buy your Zlopz now, choose your size later!













ZLOPZ ENDANGERED RANGE
Some animals are so endangered, they need a little extra help.


According to the internet, it is widely believed that the
3rd most endangered animal in the world is the:

Northern Sportive Lemur. 

So we’re making 3 PAIRS and they will only cost: 
$15,000 each.




Every cent raised from the sale of these 3 pairs of Endangered Zlopz, will go directly towards the protection of these little fuzzballs in Madagascar.

    We believe the 2nd most endangered animal in the world is the 
Amur Leopard.
We are making only 2 PAIRS of Endangered Zlopz: 
$20,000 each.



Again, every cent raised will go towards protecting this rad Leopard.

We believe the MOST endangered animal in the world is the 
Ivory-billed Woodpecker.
In fact, many believe it is already extinct. But we don't!

Which is why we’re only making 1 PAIR and selling them for:

$100,000


Introducing Earth's Rarest Zlopz:







100% of the funds raised through this perk will be used to find and protect the Ivory-billed Woodpecker! 

The Zlopz will be so rare, they'll also set the Guinness World Record as the most expensive pair of sandals ever sold, in history of the planet, ever! 





Our GOAL:To REVERSE the process of extinction.





BECOME AN HONORARY ZLOPZTER!
As backers, you’ll become part of our Herd. You are going to help us decide WHAT we are going TO DO, to STOP this madness of unnecessary extinction! 

We are asking you to leave your carbon footprint behind and help us make Zlopz not only the best sandals in the world, but the best sandals for the world too.



WHY SHOULD YOU CARE?
Well, humans are causing the problem but, they are also the ONLY species on earth, that can solve the problem. Your collective influence counts for everything and your buying habits determine how our planet will evolve in the years to come. 
The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says our planet is in some pretty serious doo-doo! 
http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg2/ 
These are the people that humans have put in charge, of looking into our global environmental impact. We know the report is long and boring, so we summarized it for you: HOLY SHIZZLE, I CANT BELIEVE HOW HOT IT'S GETTING UP IN HERE!


The Oxygen Producing Tree ($5 Perk)
Help us plant a tree in the ground and we'll send you our exclusive track: 



All The Single Trees.
By Tony Iger Ft. Ryan the Lion


The Lyrics:

How could you be, so tree like I want to be like, you are So firmly planted in the groundI know that I could be found like You are 
How could you be, So tree like I want to be like, You areSo sturdy as you grow up tall You make me feel so jealous And small
All the single trees Can blow in the gentle breeze Without them worrying please! About them losing their knees!
How could you be, So tree like I want to be like, You areSo underrated as you make it up to be so strong How could you be, So tree like I want to be like, You areSo Undefinably, Irresistibly, Beautiful
All the single trees Can blow in the gentle breeze Without them worrying please! About them losing their knees!





STRETCH GOALS

$90,000 - 7th Pair of Zlopz 

Help us decide which endangered animal needs our help next! You will also get to help us decide what the Zlopz look like, by submitting your awesome designs to us at: icandraw@zlopz.org 


Once the campaign has come to an end, all our backers will get an opportunity to vote for their favorite designs. Your design could actually help to save a species, how awesome is that!

$120,000 - Youtube Series

We'll produce a YouTube Series, starring our very own Zlopz Ranger and Tony Iger. 




They'll educate you, as they work together with teams from around the world to protect these incredible animals. Education is the most important part of nature conservation. Young or old, the more you know, the more you care. 

$180,000 - Kidz Zlopz
If we reach this target, your kidz won't only get to wear a wicked pair of Zlopz, they'll also get an opportunity to help us design them! They have to wear them after all,  it's only fair! 
Kidz Zlopz will be smaller and cuter, because they're smaller.




CROWDFUNDING 2.0
Funding for our children's future.
There are 2 Types of businesses that exist today: 



We believe there should be a 3rd type of business:






Our 4 STEP plan to change the path of global warming:1) Pick a for profit business model (haha, they are going to be so mad)
2) Start a crowdfunding campaign to reproduce that model but, in a completely sustainable way - a for non-profit business. 
3) Work with your crowd, to decide what awesome thing you are going to do for this planet, by using 50% of your profits.
4) Make something that our future generations will be proud of. 
We believe we can create businesses, that work hard to make profits for people and the planet. If we are going to be serious about reducing global warming, entrepreneurs need to start thinking about using crowdfunding, to change the fundamental way that businesses operate. 





TRANSPARENCY
We are calling upon the world, to help us find an auditor, to ensure that our business operations are 100% in the best interest of the planet.
We believe that ""business as usual"", isn't working anymore and we need a Plan B!
We need to commit to creating businesses that measure themselves on how much good they can do in the world.
We believe that by incentivizing people to create businesses that make profits for people and the planet, we can challenge humans to come up with the most sustainable business model possible. 
Dan Pallotta's TED talk will help explain the problem:

FAQ



Why do I want a pair of Zlopz so bad?
That's because they're well priced, good quality sandals, that leave awesome prints in the sand AND the're just as good as the best sandals on earth except, we use 50% of our profits to protect endangered animals and you think that's pretty rad? 
When do I get to pick the Zlopz I want?
Once the campaign has ended, we'll be able to get the right tooling to create the best sandals we can possibly make. Once we have finalized the prototypes, you'll get an email that will show you exactly what the final products are going to look like. After you've decided which pair you LOVE the most, you'll get to choose the size you want. If we're lucky and reach our goal of $500,000, you'll also have the option of choosing Kidz Zlopz. 

If I choose the “Herd of Zlopz” perk, can I choose different sizes and types of Zlopz?Indeed, you can choose from 6 different sizes, 6 different types and whether they're for a male or female human being. 
What if Zlopz do not reach their funding goal?
We are running a fixed funding campaign so, if we don't reach our target, we won't receive any of the funds and we'll be super bummed! 
Can I place an international order?
Yes. If you live outside North America, Europe, South Africa or Australia please add:
 $20 to your order if you ordered 1 pairs of Zlopz. 
$30 to your order if you ordered 2 pairs of Zlopz.
$50 to your order if you ordered 6 pairs of Zlopz.
How does Zlopz manage their Marketing Footprint?
Zlopz takes every effort to minimise our footprint, not just when making our products, but always. Our campaign relies heavily on digital platforms to minimise the usage of natural resources, and we are working flipping hard to ensure that we keep our footprint to an absolute minimum whenever we can. However, we do not claim, nor do we think it is achievable at this time, to create awareness and engagement of so many people on environmental issues with a zero footprint, but that is our aim.
How will backers be involved in the environmental voting process?
You decide which animal you want to support AND you will have a say in how we go about saving that animal. After our campaign has come to an end, you will get to cast your vote on which BIG Ideas, you think we should get behind, to protect the animal that you have chosen.
One vote for every pair of Zlopz you purchase. 
Where can I pre-order Zlopz after the campaign has closed?
On our homepage - www.zlopz.org
Why the name Zlopz?
Z = last letter in the alphabet and 
2015 = our last chance to save some of these endangered animals. 
In South Africa we call Sandals - Slops.
Z + Slops = Zlopz, on your feet.
Who do I contact if I have a question about my contribution?
If you have a question about a perk, shipping address or need to provide additional information for your contribution, please send an email to HEY@zlopz.org 




Why give 50% of the profits away?
At the end of the day we all just want to be happy.
We believe that the easiest path to happiness, is through giving.
We think, this makes us 50% closer to achieving that goal,
while maintaining a profitable business, that only impacts the world positively.


We live in the most critical time of our planets history. 


Through Crowdfunding, we can turn our dreams into reality. 


Dreamers change the world.

<p><strong>Plastics contain chemicals.

Not only does plastic degrade quickly, but heat from the dishwasher can also break it down. After prolonged or multiple uses, the surface becomes a coarse haven for bacteria and mold to hide. There is also a terrible environmental impact because so many plastic items aren't recycled, and end up in landfills and oceans.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello I am Conley Giles a member of the Lean Invention G &amp; H product development team.  We have been developing products and services for the past 30 years. </p>
<p>We were approached by a client to help to address the challenges she experiences in her daily routine to get out the door.  After getting insights and suggestions from ladies via crowdsourcing we found one of the biggest time consumers was hair care, makeup and foggy mirrors.  We took all of these concerns into consideration and The uVu Styling Station was born.  It enables ""hands free"" hair drying/styling, hands free mirror defogging and keeps everything in one organized/compact space.  We created a few prototypes and the feedback has been great. I recently went to China to finalize the product design and to setup manufacturing.  We are now ready to make it available to IndieGoGo supporters.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here is where we are at:  We have already invested thousands of dollars to research and develop the product.   We then set out to find the best blowdryer manufacturer in China along with another factory to make the stand.  After visiting the factories we were able to secure great manufacturing partners.  We have filed our patent application, shot our video, created the campaign,  and now we have launched. </p>
<p>So now, in order to fund the first production run we need to raise $39,000.  We will use these funds to produce the uVu Styling Station fixture, manufacture the uVu 2200 Pro salon quality blow dryer, detachable mirror and attachable brackets. </p>We have created some great perks so that you can be one of the first to own a uVu Styling Station.</div><div>

<p>Bone conduction is the transmission of sound to the inner ear through the bones of the skull. This can be used with individuals with normal or impaired hearing. Bone conduction is one reason why a person's voice sounds different to them when it is recorded and played back. Because the skull conducts lower frequencies better than air, people perceive their own voices to be lower and fuller than others do, and a recording of one's own voice frequently sounds higher than one expects it to sound. Musicians may use bone conduction while tuning stringed instruments to a tuning fork. After the fork starts vibrating, placing it in the mouth with the stem between the back teeth ensures that one continues to hear the note via bone conduction, and both hands are free to do the tuning.</p>

# WHAT'S DIFFERENT WITH OTHER BONE CONDUCTION GLASSES?
“SEESUN B:CON” is a Smart Bluetooth sunglass with bone conduction technology. With SEESUN’s outstanding sound quality, certified bone conduction unit, and rotational BCT, you can enjoy music and talk on the phone without blocking out external sound. The certified bone conduction unit rotates to perfectly fit different users and transmits clear sound by adhering close to your skin. The open-ear solution allows you to be aware of your surroundings and prevents hearing damage because it does not directly stimulate your ear.
VOLUME LEVEL CONTROL


PATENTED ROTATIONAL BAR
Do you think all people have same face shape? look at your friend next by you. people have different face shapes so the points well heard by bone conduction should be different. here is the solution. you can adjust rotational bar to fit correct point on you by 9 steps.

SAFE LISTENING
Why are you still wearing earphones?  Free your ears with SEESUN while increasing your personal safety.
By being able to hear the bone conduction vibrations as well as external noise, B:CON can prevent accidents that can happen during your daily life, while you drive, and participate in recreational activities etc. Hands-free and fuss-free, this is a safer way to enjoy life.

 
Technology sound system boasts superior sound quality
Many bone conduction wearable technology users are often disappointed by the sound quality of the product. However, SEESUN B:CON’s speakers were developed in a professional bone conduction lab to create the clearest sound for you. Experience the world’s best digital tuning technology through SEESUN B:CON.
 

SMART CONTROL
The Bluetooth feature allows you to make a phone call at the touch of a button in the midst of any activity. The premium quality MIC system, noise canceling system, and bone conduction technology creates freedom of conversation.

 


Bone conduction is the transmission of sound to the inner ear through the bones of the skull. This can be used with individuals with normal or impaired hearing. Bone conduction is one reason why a person's voice sounds different to them when it is recorded and played back. Because the skull conducts lower frequencies better than air, people perceive their own voices to be lower and fuller than others do, and a recording of one's own voice frequently sounds higher than one expects it to sound. Musicians may use bone conduction while tuning stringed instruments to a tuning fork. After the fork starts vibrating, placing it in the mouth with the stem between the back teeth ensures that one continues to hear the note via bone conduction, and both hands are free to do the tuning.
 

SEESUN B:CON has been KC and FCC qualified and has proven its safety and functionality (currently obtaining CE qualification).

Our interest in wearable technology glasses started about five years ago when wearable technology was still fresh and uncommon. For a company that only produced fashion glasses and sunglasses, the idea of designing smart glasses might have seemed like an impossible challenge. The first design was made after countless trials and errors, but we could not produce it because we were not satisfied with the sound quality. For two more years, our company went on a hunt to find the best sound producing technology that could suit the vision for our wearable smart glasses. Now, we are proud to introduce you to the new 2018 SEESUN B:CON through Indiegogo. We kindly ask for thoughts and reviews on the new design. Thank you again for the insightful feedback and encouragements that made this upgrade possible.   Ready for ProductionSEESUN B:CON is developed completely and had some campaigns already. we are ready to have mass production after the Indiegogo campaign has ended. if we can't meet a promised delivery date, we make sure to refund 100% immediately.Where do we ship to?We will ship out SEESUN B:CON to Worldwide, No matter where you are ! Risks and challengesSEESUN is a professional eyeglass design company with 30+ years of experience in Korea. Our team is passionate about the Bone Conduction Sunglasses. We have tested this proven product and know you will love it! We will do everything we can to make sure your pre-order is delivered on time as scheduled.

<b><h3>Concept</h3></b></b><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>LookMyBabouch [LMB]</i></b> is more than just another shoe brand. Founded by Nacim Ben Moussa, a French “nomad entrepreneur” living between France and Asia,
the brand is the result of a true melting pot taking its energy and
inspirations from Africa, Europe and Asia.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Fusing the concept of traditional Tunisian leather slippers (aka “Babouch”) and an icon from urban culture - the original canvas sneaker, <b><i>LookMyBabouch</i></b> created the “sneaker-babouch”. The classic pointed toe shape of the slipper is retained but the footwear is remade into urban style sneakers that will take you from the busy alleys of the medina to concrete pavements in New York or cobblestone pathways of Paris.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
</b><p></p>
</div><b>
</b><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Nacim has always drawn inspiration from his
French and Tunisian roots. In 2011, the dynamic energy of Tunisian Jasmine
Revolution fuelled the unconventional entrepreneur to write the first line in
the story of <b><i>LookMyBabouch</i></b>. Helped by a few friends, he created a shoe that
speaks to different cultures.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p>We’ve spent
the last couple of years working on this project: sourcing materials, finding
suppliers, developing our brand and designing our collection.</p>
<p>We love wearing our shoes and we’ve gotten great feedback from people
that already purchased our sneakers.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p><div>
<h3>Our Products</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1314956/files/20150322093354-Product-detail-2.jpg?1427042034"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The “sneaker-babouch” is unisex and designed
for comfort. Light cotton canvas sheathes the feet and allows optimal breathability.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The insole is crafted from soft mouton leather and printed with the logo of the model. The cow leather shoe tab (or decorative tongue) is embossed with the <b><i>LookMyBabouch</i></b> logo making it easy to
slip it on and off. The outsole is made of EVA mixed with rubber to ensure good
grip on most surfaces.</p>
<p>The products are delivered with a cotton bag to transport your
shoes easily.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><br/></h3>
<div>
<h3>What your money goes towards</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We already invested in the research and development of the sneaker-babouch, and have completed a few productions for the past few years. Most of the money you pledge will go directly toward covering the costs of manufacturing the next batch (including the new models) and that include: raw materials, cut/stitching/etc and shipping. Rest of the money will be used to promote our product, introduce new colors and designs, attend trade shows and pay the campaign fees (Indiegogo &amp; Paypal).</p>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------We have been working on this project for the last couple of years and are very excited to introduce our products. We are now on Indiegogo as we need your support to take it to the next level!




ConceptLookMyBabouch [LMB] is more than just another shoe brand. Founded by Nacim Ben Moussa, a French “nomad entrepreneur” living between France and Asia,
the brand is the result of a true melting pot taking its energy and
inspirations from Africa, Europe and Asia.
Fusing the concept of traditional Tunisian leather slippers (aka “Babouch”) and an icon from urban culture - the original canvas sneaker, LookMyBabouch created the “sneaker-babouch”. The classic pointed toe shape of the slipper is retained but the footwear is remade into urban style sneakers that will take you from the busy alleys of the medina to concrete pavements in New York or cobblestone pathways of Paris.

Find us on: 

      






Our Story


Nacim has always drawn inspiration from his
French and Tunisian roots. In 2011, the dynamic energy of Tunisian Jasmine
Revolution fuelled the unconventional entrepreneur to write the first line in
the story of LookMyBabouch. Helped by a few friends, he created a shoe that
speaks to different cultures.

We’ve spent
the last couple of years working on this project: sourcing materials, finding
suppliers, developing our brand and designing our collection.
We love wearing our shoes and we’ve gotten great feedback from people
that already purchased our sneakers.

Our Products



The “sneaker-babouch” is unisex and designed
for comfort. Light cotton canvas sheathes the feet and allows optimal breathability.
The insole is crafted from soft mouton leather and printed with the logo of the model. The cow leather shoe tab (or decorative tongue) is embossed with the LookMyBabouch logo making it easy to
slip it on and off. The outsole is made of EVA mixed with rubber to ensure good
grip on most surfaces.
The products are delivered with a cotton bag to transport your
shoes easily.



What your money goes towards
We already invested in the research and development of the sneaker-babouch, and have completed a few productions for the past few years. Most of the money you pledge will go directly toward covering the costs of manufacturing the next batch (including the new models) and that include: raw materials, cut/stitching/etc and shipping. Rest of the money will be used to promote our product, introduce new colors and designs, attend trade shows and pay the campaign fees (Indiegogo & Paypal).

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>A line of leather jackets in 2 styles for both men and women.</p>
<ul>
<li>Double Riders (*<i>Perfecto type</i>)</li>
<li>Single Riders (<i>*Speedway type</i>).</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Each style has the same features!</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Water-repellent finish</li>
<li>Stain resistant finish</li>
<li>Wind resistant finish</li>
<li>High durability and comfort</li>
<li>A place for almost everything in 3 zipped pockets and 1 inside pocket.</li>
</ul>
<p>(The double riders also gets a coin pocket secured with a flap and snap button.)</p>
<p><i>One other thing; we are a small company without large resources, this project is made possible because of our close relationship with our factory and suppliers. We haven't wasted any resources on expensive ad campaigns and promotional videos. Everything was shot by us using the actual products that we guarantee to deliver to our backers.</i></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">A New Era for Leather</h2>
<p>It all began with a simple idea.</p>
<p><strong>""Wouldn't it be great if leather could be resistant to effects of water exposure and stains!"" </strong></p>
<p>We took this idea to our production partner and over the course of the next year and, after many trials and errors, (Its never easy developing something new and innovative) we created this revolutionary water repellent finish.</p>

<p>Our soft and durable lamb leather jackets have a natural stretch that allows for ease of movement and comfort. Whether your out touring on your favourite bike (be it a Harley, a Honda, a Vespa or even a Pashley!) or just strolling around town you know you'll not only look great but also safe in the knowledge that you're also protected from any unexpected changes in the weather.</p>

<p><i>*Soft, durable and stretchable napa lamb leather.</i></p>
<p>Synthetic materials don’t get better with age…in fact they don’t age at all. Leather on the other hand, especially our full grain aniline dyed lamb leather, has the unique quality in that the more it ages the more character it has. Our jackets will develop a patina with age. Making the jacket more beautiful with time, without losing its shape or colour.</p>
<p>So, the love and care you give your jacket is rewarded by the fact that it will only get better the more you give!</p>
<p>It was important to us that we use the highest quality Napa lamb leather for this revolutionary line up. Working closely with our partner factory, we selected the most suitable Napa lamb leather available.</p>
<p><i>*We only use ethically &amp; sustainably sourced leather from local Pakistani farmers. The animals are all grass fed and the leather is a bi product, meaning the animal is #NotFarmedForFashion. We do this to give support to the local economy in the fullest possible way, helping provide the local population with food, enhancing crop production, generating cash income, providing year-round employment, spreading risk and providing fuel and transport and in some small way helping shape the future of the fashion industry.</i></p>

<h3>Made to Last</h3>
<p>The common perception of leather is that it is sensitive to moisture. However, it doesn’t have to be this way. After much testing we have added a revolutionary stain and water repellent treatment during the dying process, utilising Stahl Neo®&amp; Densodrin® range of products for sustainable tanning &amp; high-performance water-repellency to ensure the long-lasting durability of the Jackets. This leaves the jackets immaculate even when exposed to water.</p>
<p><i>*We chose Stahl as our leather solutions partner because of their commitment to the environment and strive to make leather production as ethical and environmentally friendly as possible.</i></p>
<p>As soon as we receive the skins, we send them directly to Stahl so they can go about turning them into the beautiful leather required for this project. Some time later, the dry leathers are sent to the cutting table where they are cut by hand into the 2 different styles. Both styles contain a lot of individual parts so this can take a while. When the leather is cut, it is passed to our tailors. They work with each piece separately, and this is the part of the process where the jacket starts to take shape. The skilled tailors add the original printed lining together with all trims, including buttons and zippers.</p>
<p>After weeks of hard work, love and dedication in the production process, the jacket is perfected and ready to be shipped.</p>

<p><i>*1920's era Kyoto town house ""Kyo-machi-ya"" </i></p>
<p>We are looking to raise raise ¥6,000,000 (US$58,000). We would like to use the bulk of this (After costs) to renovate the ground floor of our ""Machiya townhouse"" office into London Denims first physical stand alone store. </p>
<p>For this campaign we set out to challenge the established pricing model of today, where traditional luxury brands mark-up their prices in some cases up to 800%. Their business model includes distributors, agents, high-street retail locations and excessive marketing. As all these middlemen need their margin, the apparel ends up overpriced and silly expensive. We decided to challenge that model. By teaming up directly with our manufacturers, cutting out the middlemen and selling our products directly to you, we can now offer these premium quality jackets at factory direct prices. </p>
<p>Super Early Bird @ 50% off RRP (limited to 40), Early Bird @ 40% off RRP, (limited to 60) Better late than never @ 30% off RRP. Any 2 Super Early Birds Jackets @ 55% off RRP (limited to 10), Any 2 Early Bird Jackets @ 45% off RRP (limited to 20) and Any 2 Better late than never deals @ 35% off RRP (limited to 30)</p>

<p><i>*We tested to see if the jackets were resistance to effects of water exposure by pooling an equal amount of water in 2 jackets. The jacket on the left (Blue) has been treated with our revolutionary water-repellency finish and the one on the right (grey) is untreated leather. The test was conducted over a 6 hour period and as you can see the treated jacket shows no signs of being affected by water in any way, no water soaked into the leather or seeped through to the lining. Unfortunately the same could not be said for the untreated leather, which soaked up all the water, transferring it to the lining.</i></p>
<p><i>​*Even after 24 hours the treated jacket still showed no signs of being affected by the water. No water soaked into the leather or seeped through to the lining.</i></p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h2>
<p>For this project we are using only Top Grain Lamb Leather that has been finished with our revolutionary water-repellency finish. (This took nearly 1 year to perfect. The leather is treated during the tanning / dying process and again as a final treatment as garments.)</p>
<p>We only use ethically &amp; sustainably sourced leather from local Pakistani farmers. The animals are all grass fed and the leather is a bi product, meaning the animal is #NotFarmedForFashion. We do this to give support to the local economy in the fullest possible way, helping provide the local population with food, enhancing crop production, generating cash income, providing year-round employment, spreading risk and providing fuel and transport and in some small way helping shape the future of the fashion industry.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Project Details</h2>
<p>Many Leather products sold today often show both ""sheep leather"" and ""lamb leather"" as lamb leather, however we guarantee this product uses only carefully selected sustainable lamb leather. No leather made for clothing has ever been truly water-resistant. (<i>The leather material used for bags and shoes, etc. is hard, so it can be waterproofed.</i>) In addition, although there are light water repellent processes for leather used in clothing, eventually the water will soak through to the back side, all too often leaving unpleasant water marks and stains. Above all, the appeal of this product is that it is completely water-resistant, while having the softness and stretchability that are characteristic of high quality lamb leather. (<i>Stretchability also works well for motorcycle touring.</i>) In addition, timeless styling makes it simple to coordinate either of these jackets for any social occasion whilst having the reassurance that no matter what the weather brings your full grain lamb leather jacket will keep you safe and dry, and just as importantly protect itself in the process! </p>

</div><p>And that's all there is to it.</p><p> </p></div>","Overview
A line of leather jackets in 2 styles for both men and women.

Double Riders (*Perfecto type)
Single Riders (*Speedway type).

Each style has the same features!

Water-repellent finish
Stain resistant finish
Wind resistant finish
High durability and comfort
A place for almost everything in 3 zipped pockets and 1 inside pocket.

(The double riders also gets a coin pocket secured with a flap and snap button.)
One other thing; we are a small company without large resources, this project is made possible because of our close relationship with our factory and suppliers. We haven't wasted any resources on expensive ad campaigns and promotional videos. Everything was shot by us using the actual products that we guarantee to deliver to our backers.
A New Era for Leather
It all began with a simple idea.
""Wouldn't it be great if leather could be resistant to effects of water exposure and stains!"" 
We took this idea to our production partner and over the course of the next year and, after many trials and errors, (Its never easy developing something new and innovative) we created this revolutionary water repellent finish.

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

WATER REPELLENT

We made them water repellent so you wouldn't have to worry if you are caught in an unexpected shower.

STAIN RESISTANT

We know spills can happen, especially after a few rounds, that's why we also made them stain resistant. Coffee, beer, wine, soda, cocktails your jacket will ride away stain free.

NATURAL STRETCH
Our soft and durable lamb leather jackets have a natural stretch that allows for ease of movement and comfort. Whether your out touring on your favourite bike (be it a Harley, a Honda, a Vespa or even a Pashley!) or just strolling around town you know you'll not only look great but also safe in the knowledge that you're also protected from any unexpected changes in the weather.
 

The Leather

*Soft, durable and stretchable napa lamb leather.
Synthetic materials don’t get better with age…in fact they don’t age at all. Leather on the other hand, especially our full grain aniline dyed lamb leather, has the unique quality in that the more it ages the more character it has. Our jackets will develop a patina with age. Making the jacket more beautiful with time, without losing its shape or colour.
So, the love and care you give your jacket is rewarded by the fact that it will only get better the more you give!
It was important to us that we use the highest quality Napa lamb leather for this revolutionary line up. Working closely with our partner factory, we selected the most suitable Napa lamb leather available.
*We only use ethically & sustainably sourced leather from local Pakistani farmers. The animals are all grass fed and the leather is a bi product, meaning the animal is #NotFarmedForFashion. We do this to give support to the local economy in the fullest possible way, helping provide the local population with food, enhancing crop production, generating cash income, providing year-round employment, spreading risk and providing fuel and transport and in some small way helping shape the future of the fashion industry.
 
Treatment & Production

Made to Last
The common perception of leather is that it is sensitive to moisture. However, it doesn’t have to be this way. After much testing we have added a revolutionary stain and water repellent treatment during the dying process, utilising Stahl Neo®& Densodrin® range of products for sustainable tanning & high-performance water-repellency to ensure the long-lasting durability of the Jackets. This leaves the jackets immaculate even when exposed to water.
*We chose Stahl as our leather solutions partner because of their commitment to the environment and strive to make leather production as ethical and environmentally friendly as possible.
As soon as we receive the skins, we send them directly to Stahl so they can go about turning them into the beautiful leather required for this project. Some time later, the dry leathers are sent to the cutting table where they are cut by hand into the 2 different styles. Both styles contain a lot of individual parts so this can take a while. When the leather is cut, it is passed to our tailors. They work with each piece separately, and this is the part of the process where the jacket starts to take shape. The skilled tailors add the original printed lining together with all trims, including buttons and zippers.
After weeks of hard work, love and dedication in the production process, the jacket is perfected and ready to be shipped.
 

What We Need & What You Get

*1920's era Kyoto town house ""Kyo-machi-ya"" 
We are looking to raise raise ¥6,000,000 (US$58,000). We would like to use the bulk of this (After costs) to renovate the ground floor of our ""Machiya townhouse"" office into London Denims first physical stand alone store. 
For this campaign we set out to challenge the established pricing model of today, where traditional luxury brands mark-up their prices in some cases up to 800%. Their business model includes distributors, agents, high-street retail locations and excessive marketing. As all these middlemen need their margin, the apparel ends up overpriced and silly expensive. We decided to challenge that model. By teaming up directly with our manufacturers, cutting out the middlemen and selling our products directly to you, we can now offer these premium quality jackets at factory direct prices. 
Super Early Bird @ 50% off RRP (limited to 40), Early Bird @ 40% off RRP, (limited to 60) Better late than never @ 30% off RRP. Any 2 Super Early Birds Jackets @ 55% off RRP (limited to 10), Any 2 Early Bird Jackets @ 45% off RRP (limited to 20) and Any 2 Better late than never deals @ 35% off RRP (limited to 30)
 

 
Even if we do not reach our intended goal all funds raised, minus the costs of course, will still be used towards the ongoing restoration of our ""Machiya townhouse"".
 
Free Garment Bag
 

*1 complimentary original London Denim garment bag (Black) with every jacket.
 

The Test!

*We tested to see if the jackets were resistance to effects of water exposure by pooling an equal amount of water in 2 jackets. The jacket on the left (Blue) has been treated with our revolutionary water-repellency finish and the one on the right (grey) is untreated leather. The test was conducted over a 6 hour period and as you can see the treated jacket shows no signs of being affected by water in any way, no water soaked into the leather or seeped through to the lining. Unfortunately the same could not be said for the untreated leather, which soaked up all the water, transferring it to the lining.
​*Even after 24 hours the treated jacket still showed no signs of being affected by the water. No water soaked into the leather or seeped through to the lining. The Impact
For this project we are using only Top Grain Lamb Leather that has been finished with our revolutionary water-repellency finish. (This took nearly 1 year to perfect. The leather is treated during the tanning / dying process and again as a final treatment as garments.)
We only use ethically & sustainably sourced leather from local Pakistani farmers. The animals are all grass fed and the leather is a bi product, meaning the animal is #NotFarmedForFashion. We do this to give support to the local economy in the fullest possible way, helping provide the local population with food, enhancing crop production, generating cash income, providing year-round employment, spreading risk and providing fuel and transport and in some small way helping shape the future of the fashion industry.
 
Our Factory
PAKISTAN is considered to be the hub of producing high quality Leather and Leather Products. Pakistan is rich in agricultural products and environment. The large livestock population plays an important role in the economy of Pakistan.

Some time later, the dry leathers are sent to the cutting table where they are cut by hand into the 2 different styles.

The careful selection of leather is the key to a quality product. If you use the wrinkled parts at the edge of the material the cost will decrease, but so will the quality of the product.

When the leather is cut, it is passed to our tailors. They work with each piece separately, and this is the part of the process where the jacket starts to take shape. The skilled tailors add the original printed lining together with all trims, including buttons and zippers.​


 
Project Details
Many Leather products sold today often show both ""sheep leather"" and ""lamb leather"" as lamb leather, however we guarantee this product uses only carefully selected sustainable lamb leather. No leather made for clothing has ever been truly water-resistant. (The leather material used for bags and shoes, etc. is hard, so it can be waterproofed.) In addition, although there are light water repellent processes for leather used in clothing, eventually the water will soak through to the back side, all too often leaving unpleasant water marks and stains. Above all, the appeal of this product is that it is completely water-resistant, while having the softness and stretchability that are characteristic of high quality lamb leather. (Stretchability also works well for motorcycle touring.) In addition, timeless styling makes it simple to coordinate either of these jackets for any social occasion whilst having the reassurance that no matter what the weather brings your full grain lamb leather jacket will keep you safe and dry, and just as importantly protect itself in the process! 
 
The jackets in the real world!

<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>My name is Amber Green,  I am a 23 year old female from Atlanta Georgia.</p>
<p>I came up with a product that efficiently preserves the straight hairstyle while creating a healthier way to set hair during down time.</p>
<p>For use, simply twist side brushes to extract bristles, place on head, twist clockwise or counter clockwise until hair is completely in cap, and retract bristles for comfort.</p>
<p>The Wrap Cap puts a unique twist to the night wear industry because it does the job of at least four different hair appliances and none of my competition has the ability to wrap hair without the help of other appliances.</p>
<p>The hair industry is a billion dollar industry that continues to grow, my product has the ability to persevere the straight hairstyle for a longer period of time, saving time, money and energy.  </p>
<p>My invention relates generally to cap, and more specifically, to a cap fitted to the head with brush bristles inside the cap which brushes hair into a circular wrap style as the cap is twisted clockwise or counter clockwise. The brushes I have on my latest prototype are round, plastic, 3 inches in diameter with retractable bristles for comfort for the wearer.  The cap material is made out of stretch satin with an elastic band around the opening for a better fit to the head. This product is patented technology.</p>
<p>Individuals have been using the wrap method to preserve the straight hair style for years. The problem lies in that, many people don’t know how to wrap their hair using regular brushes and pins or simply are too lazy after a hard days’ work.  My product is a major improvement of the already known wrap methods. Imagine saving time when ever you need to preserve your straight hair style during down time like working out or sleeping. Imagine saving money by maintaining that fresh blow out for days longer. Imagine saving energy by skipping that step of straightening  your hair before going out.  If my goal is reached, the funds I am seeking will go to perfecting my latest prototype, starting my marketing campaign and receiving my first batch of inventory.  </p>

<p>At almost six months old, our son Luke was still waking up every hour and a half.  Like so many other new parents we were desperate for sleep. One night we placed him under a heavy throw blanket while sitting on our couch. I noticed a calm immediately came over his face. A lightbulb went off in my head: he needs a weighted blanket! I called my mother-in-law to sew my idea; a lightly weighted sleep sack. The first night wearing our prototype Luke slept 12 hours! We couldn’t believe how immediately his sleep was improved. Word quickly spread and I was flooded with requests from family and friends.  The idea to bring Dreamland Baby to families everywhere was born.</p>

<p>Risks and challenges</p>
<p>We are a team of designers, operation and manufacturing specialists, clinical experts and like you, moms. We understand what goes into designing a premier product that babies and moms will love. <br/>Our manufacturing partners are ready to go. We are using a trusted factory that also produces for Disney. We have already produced a sample run – to ensure quality, safety and performance. A number of lucky family and friends have already received Dreamland and are currently enjoying a full night's sleep. <br/>Based on our experience, we anticipate being able to fulfill orders around 8 weeks after the Kickstarter concludes.</p>
</div><div> </div></div>","Dreamland Baby is a premier line of Weighted Sleep Sacks designed to naturally reduce stress and increase relaxation through deep touch stimulation.  
The gentle weight increases serotonin and melatonin while decreasing cortisol. Helping babies feel calm, fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer.
Clinically proven to significantly increase calm feelings and improve sleep patterns in a study that investigated newborns and weighted blankets. 

Nearly half of all new parents get just 1 - 3 hours of uninterrupted sleep per night. Dreamland Baby can help change that... 


A well rested baby is a happy baby.... 

Dreamland Baby's wearable weighted blankets are designed in partnership with pediatricians, NICU nurses and certified sleep consults.
Dreamland Baby is Safety Certified, has exceeded all United States Consumer Product Safety Commission standards,  and is recognized by the International Hip Dysplasia Institute as a hip-healthy product. 

A parent’s hug is scientifically proven to soothe. Dreamland Baby's gentle weight mimics this touch leading to improved mood, relaxation and ultimately sleep. 
Many Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) use weighted components to calm babies and promote deep, restful sleep. The gentle weight provides near-instant comfort and relief. 
Weighted blankets have been used for adults and children for many years. Infants now have the opportunity to safely get the same incredible sleep and relaxation through Dreamland Baby's wearable weighted blankets. 


At almost six months old, our son Luke was still waking up every hour and a half.  Like so many other new parents we were desperate for sleep. One night we placed him under a heavy throw blanket while sitting on our couch. I noticed a calm immediately came over his face. A lightbulb went off in my head: he needs a weighted blanket! I called my mother-in-law to sew my idea; a lightly weighted sleep sack. The first night wearing our prototype Luke slept 12 hours! We couldn’t believe how immediately his sleep was improved. Word quickly spread and I was flooded with requests from family and friends.  The idea to bring Dreamland Baby to families everywhere was born.


 


We set out to create a swaddle that keeps baby’s arms secure and is convenient for parents. The ingenious removable wing allows baby to stay snug while you wash the wing or completely remove it if baby rolls over before six months.
 



Our products are expertly crafted for the highest quality, made of 100% soft, natural cotton.  From beautiful, instagram-worthy design to thoughtful materials sourcing, we set out to design a product that looks and feels as great as it performs.

At just 10% or less of your baby's body weight, Dreamland Baby's gentle weight helps calm your baby by simulating the feeling of being held and hugged. 
The even distribution of weight, covering your baby's entire body, sets us apart from anything else on the market. Dreamland Baby is the world's FIRST wearable weighted blanket!

There is another company that makes a sleep product with a weighted component on the chest, only.  We ordered this product and for us, it did not work. My son likes to be hugged and feel a gentle pressure on his entire body. He wanted a wearable weighted blanket. 

Dreamland's weighted filling is a High Density Plastic Poly Pellet (think Beanie Babies™). The material is odorless, non-toxic, and food grade, completely safe! The rounded beads are evenly distributed in hand-sewn 1'' boxes to provide a gentle weight and comfortable texture.

<p></p></div>","Introducing VIG


We
designed VIG wallet with active people in mind. The dimensions of VIG
are reduced to occupy minimal space while offering functional and
resistant features.
We
are obsessed with perfecting this design, to make a unique product
for the unique lives of our customers. We also want to ensure the
production of VIG is environmentally conscious, so both
main components are 100%
recyclable materials.

VIG
can hold up to 10 credit cards plus bank notes... with style.The collection we offer for this campaign consists of Indigo, Roig, Noir, Lola, Fiesta and Toro:                 


                
               
VIG is made of different materials 

    OverviewVIG
is a tri-fold polypropylene wallet with a large textile band.

With
your VIG you can hold multiple cards and bank notes, depending on
your needs:


Inside:
		holds up to 7 cards or 5 cards and 4 bank notes*


Outside:
		holds up to 3 cards or 5 bank notes*

(*
bank notes total capacity will depend on the currency)

The
VIG is made of two components that are 100% recyclable:


Body:
	polypropylene resin, identification code nº5 

Band:
	elastic textile, sewed and stitched
Project StatusAfter 11 months of intense work, designing and testing Vig prototypes, we're satisfied that the design is complete. Now we're ready to begin production.All of our stakeholders have participated actively in the process. We designed Vig wallet by iterations, collecting feedback from users, and using that feedback to improve each prototype until we had it right. Lean Startup Methodology has been our principal guideline in this process. Pictured below there are the last prototype version:We will continue releasing new Vig color combinations. And these will be made available as we reach our financial goals.For the first run, we'll limit manufacturing to 5 models (Indiegogo Collection) from our Vig collection. This is a strategic decision to reduce risk of overextending our investment capital. If we exceed our funding goals, we will consider including more models of our collection in the first production run:We want the maximum benefit from the production phase and to, of course, achieve the best results. For this reason our proposal is to produce Vig wallets in Europe and U.S. This means the production costs will be slightly higher, but this arrangement will allow us better control of the production process and ease of intervention in case of production issues.We understand that people don't want to sacrifice quality for price, and price is a vital aspect of the product's success today's market. Users deserve products that are durable, functional and affordable. We want to meet these expectations and to do so we need two main things:  A minimum of 560 orders or 1195 wallets  The steel mold necessary for plastic injection (polypropylene)            The steel mold is the most expensive part of this investment and drives the bulk of our pledge request. Your investment will finance the production of the Vig wallet mold and plastic injection, to allow delivery of the finial product to our users.  
Production Plan
We have everything ready to start the production. We have compared different suppliers of industrial molds and plastic injectors. We  have also planned deadlines and following up meetings for the production. Communication process: we understand the importance of communication to our backers, we will provide continuous updates during the evolution of production. The production schedule is divided in 16 weeks , from receiving funds to final product shippment to our backers. Have a look below on our detailed activity plan:

Oscar was working on a new wallet concept and Silvia saw the potential of the idea. Silvia proposed they start a new project together, based on his wallet idea. Oscar accepted, of course! Next, Silvia set up the project principals and management milestones, while Oscar lead the design effort for the first Vig wallet. During the design phase work accumulated quickly, and two more people with specific professional skills joined to complete the Vig project team: Ernest Perera - Product Designer, and Rafa Castillo - Art Director.The team has worked well together, with assistance from online tools, despite great distances between individuals. The team members are located: Silvia - U.S., Oscar and Ernest - Barcelona, and Rafa - Mexico D.F.The diversity of the Vig team members made this project possible: Silvia runs her own fashion company, Le soleil de Miami. Oscar is a Computer Engineer with a solid background in software application development. Ernest is a Product Designer who also runs his own company, Amor de Madre. And Rafa Castillo is an Art Director who works at an advertising company. We found the best talent every place and from everyone!Risks and challengesThe main challenge is making sure the Vig wallet mold is manufactured in time to meet production needs. We want to ensure we're able to take advantage of the cutting-edge plastics injection technology available now. Timing is everything. Delays could risk the project being completed months after our goal, which could push product release past the ideal time for best market exposure.Questions and answers1.-Exactly how can I organize my cards and banknotes in the VIG wallet?There are many possibilities as described in the section ""Overview"" (last pictures).We have also just loaded a new photograph in the gallery to give you a clearer idea of what looks like...Remember: the current picture shows a prototype; the final model will be much more sexy ;-)2.-How do I order my VIG neck strap?You just have to add the neck strap perk to your VIG wallet order.You will choose the color of the neck strap at the same time as the color of your VIG(s)... at the end of the campaign. Remember: only one necklace holder per VIG ordered and... DELIVERY IS FREE WORLDWIDE!3.-Why is there a translucent model?This is a very, very good question! After many months of design, we came with the idea that some of us may like to know the content of the wallet without having to open it. For example, you can see your driving licence through it, without having to open your VIG (which might prove helpful in the rain, snow, shower, etc...)You will find additional shots of this model in the gallery.ReferencesPedal Consumption  http://www.pedalconsumption.com/2013/12/vig-wallet/

Right now our time line is based on our successful crowd fund amount, plus a bit more, but if we were to have a much larger then expected response this could effect how fast we are able to produce all that swimwear and apparel. We are hoping to mitigate this potential challenge by letting our factory know in advance and also to keep all of our crowd funders up to date on progress.</p>

Hey! Im Sara, surf enthusiast and nature lover. I'm super passionate about what we're trying to achieve with PARC and I know you will be too. 
I want to be able to get out on the water and not feel self conscious. I want grab my long board and go have fun. And I want everyone to feel the same way!
Looking at all these images of super tanned ladies with one body type in every single image can get depressing. I've talked with so many women who don't want to get out on the water solely because of how they feel in a bathing suit. I know how amazing being active and being on the water makes me feel and I want that for every one. You shouldn't feel that you can't do something because of the way that main stream media has portrayed women in that sport.
I want all women to feel confident to get out there so I wanted to create swimwear that makes you love how you feel so you can do what you love! 
But we can't make this happen without your help. Please share and/or pledge to our campaign and help us make a difference.
- Sara 


What's Unique About A PARC Suit?

Our designs are all based off the needs for active women with different shapes. There is a style to accommodate different bust sizes, bum coverages and different activities. 
Our swimwear is made with a high-quality, soft, supportive and quick dry fabric. Think along the lines of a silky soft really light neoprene. No saggy bums here!


    
The Impact We're not just about bikini's:


You are helping us to make a positive impact on the industry and in the lives of young women. We feature the real women and positive role models who wear our suits. These women come in all shapes and sizes and we want to promote a positive body image no matter your shape.
We want to keep our footprint as minimal as possible which is why we design in Vancouver and manufacture in the USA. 
We donate 10% of profits to organizations that encourage young women to get active and build confidence. The money goes to creating scholarships for these programs for girls who don't have the financial means to attend.
 


What We Need:

We need enough capital in order to run production with our manufacturer and create inventory. 
All funds will go towards purchasing bulk orders of fabric and production costs. 


How You Can Help:

By supporting us on this Indiegogo campaign by pledging one of the options below. 
By sharing us to all your friends and family through the Indiegogo share links. We want to get the word out about our amazing swimwear and initiatives and we need your help!

*Please note the design process has to be approved on both ends before we will go ahead with production. Please contact us if you have any questions. 





   Risks & Challenges: A potential risk and challenge with our project is production timing. Right now our time line is based on our successful crowd fund amount, plus a bit more, but if we were to have a much larger then expected response this could effect how fast we are able to produce all that swimwear and apparel. We are hoping to mitigate this potential challenge by letting our factory know in advance and also to keep all of our crowd funders up to date on progress.",33.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>•At <b>Athletica V</b>, we design and manufacture athletic apparel, only using cruelty free materials (fabrics, inks, dyes, etc) to create the most vegan athletic apparel on the market. We also exclusively source domestic materials and labor, keeping our footprint small and controllable.</p>
<p>•Everything we use is investigated and validated to make sure it adheres to a cruelty-free lifestyle. We ask all of our suppliers to confirm that the materials we are buying are animal product/byproduct free. If they can't answer that question (or can't answer 'yes' to that question), we don't buy from them. </p>
<p>•What we've created is an apparel company that is about as far from the animal supply chain as possible. At <b>Athletica V</b>, we don't offer a few vegan options. Rather, we <b>ONLY have vegan options</b>. Bottom line, we're invested in making garments that are as ethical as you are.</p>
<p>Help us get these new tops created! We've had a dream of revolutionizing the athletic apparel market, making amazing clothing that is as cruelty-free as it gets, sourced exclusively from the United States and made by American workers. It can happen - but not without your help!</p>

<p>Making 100% vegan garments exclusively in the USA isn’t easy. We’ll tell you that up front.

Making 100% vegan garments exclusively in the USA isn’t easy. We’ll tell you that up front. The amount of time, energy and effort that we've put forward to design and make vegan workout apparel is huge. Being a small start up, there are a ton of hurdles that can trip us up. But not if we have the best thing a small company can have on its side: Demand!That's where you come in. With your help we will be able to get over those hurdles and nothing will keep us from bringing you some amazing apparel!

Other Ways You Can Help

<h3>Hi, thank you for checking out my campaign :)</h3>
<p>You may know me, Sahasa, from Instagram (<strong>@sahasa.artist</strong>) where I have regularly been posting my art since Summer 2016, much of it being in the form of <strong>miniature koi ponds</strong> (handsculpted polymer clay koi encased in resin.)</p>
<p><strong>The ponds aren't the most accessible type of creation, and I have been wondering what I could do about this... To bring my work to many of you in an affordable way: </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Solution: design a koi enamel pin!</strong></h2>
<p>The designing part is over, I sketched &amp; scribbled and then created a nice clean design from the drafts by using the pen tool in Photoshop. See what I came up with below, a lovely Tancho Showa koi. A white koi with a red spot on the head and black markings on the body and fins. The idea is to use gold plating on this pin and a rubber clutch on the back.</p>

<p>Now, this pin still needs to be <strong>manufactured</strong>. To ensure high quality I found a trusted company that can produce the pins... <strong>but I need your help to fund this project! </strong>I would love to make this wearable, and collectable piece of art and durable 40 mm koi pin a reality.</p>

<h3>Risk</h3>

<li>There's very little risk for this campaign. The company I selected for producing this pin is trusted and reliable. They have verified the design can be made. It's possible some minor design changes may occur.</li>

</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Waiting Game</h3>
<p>Be aware the campaign will run for 30 days. A good thing to keep in mind is the production time of the pin, which at this moment, I have been told by the company would be <strong>4 to 6 weeks</strong>. This may be different when I place the order. I will be ordering after the campaign ends and funding has been cleared etc.</p>
<p>When I receive the pins from the production company, I will check every single one, package them by hand and then ship them out to you. Depending from where you are in the world this may take another<strong> 1 to 2 weeks. </strong></p>
