<p>'Greg Moodie's Election Dissection' is a 136-page colour-explosion in a large-format 297 x 297 cm (roughly 12"" x 12"").

Anyone contributing during this 3-week period will receive a signed and numbered first edition copy. <br/></p>
<p>All your favourites are here - Rockstar Sturgeon, Glue-Sniffing Jim Murphy, Deputy Dugdale, Margaret Curran In Space, Spider John McTernan, Eddie Bear and Corky, The Fluffy Bunny, The Cardboard Cutout Scottish Secretary, Nosferatu Giddy Osborne, Tennents Special David Cameron, Piggybacking-LibDems, UKIP Trolls, plus hats and moustaches that move in mysterious ways.</p>
<p>There are four levels of perks. The Tache-Lite is the downloadable book in pdf format. The Main Election is the signed and numbered first edition.

<p><span>Heya I’m Anthea West, a Comic Artist, Illustrator and Animator from Dublin! I’m a full time student and a part time comic creator though I’m hoping for that to change within the next year. I’m a member of Zenpop Indie Comics where I have my Webcomic Desolate Ceremony hosted there:<span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span><a href=""http://zenpop.org/desolateceremony"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://zenpop.org/desolateceremony</a>. Comics and stories are a huge passion of mine and something I really want to set my career on. </span></p>
<p><span>This campaign is to raise funds for my upcoming comic The Earthbound God, it’s my biggest project yet and it's something I've been developing for over a year now. I think this comic it will really help get my name out there in Irish/English comic scene. At the moment I’m simply a small fish!</span></p>
<p><span>Without funding I have no hope of getting my book printed out into the world and onto the Convention circuit so this is why I’m humbling asking for a helping hand. </span></p>
<h3><span>How you can help</span></h3>
<p><span>The goal is $500. With this I’ll be able to print out a large number of books, not just to sell at conventions but to send out to people and sell in comic shops like Forbidden Planet. If by some miracle I make over the marker I may be able to invest in making an Art book as well. This however is not the focus, The Earthbound God is. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>The Perks</span></strong><span>, depending on how much you donate are:</span></p>
<p><span>Exclusive Desktop Wallpaper</span></p>
<p><span><img alt=""Grey and white poster with a leaping deer monster"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i213.photobucket.com/albums/cc75/antheawest/TEGTiny.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Desktop poster""/> </span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p><span>Thank you very much for reading!</span></p></div>","So who is this and what are they trying to do?
Heya I’m Anthea West, a Comic Artist, Illustrator and Animator from Dublin! I’m a full time student and a part time comic creator though I’m hoping for that to change within the next year. I’m a member of Zenpop Indie Comics where I have my Webcomic Desolate Ceremony hosted there: http://zenpop.org/desolateceremony. Comics and stories are a huge passion of mine and something I really want to set my career on. 
This campaign is to raise funds for my upcoming comic The Earthbound God, it’s my biggest project yet and it's something I've been developing for over a year now. I think this comic it will really help get my name out there in Irish/English comic scene. At the moment I’m simply a small fish!
Without funding I have no hope of getting my book printed out into the world and onto the Convention circuit so this is why I’m humbling asking for a helping hand. 
How you can help
The goal is $500. With this I’ll be able to print out a large number of books, not just to sell at conventions but to send out to people and sell in comic shops like Forbidden Planet. If by some miracle I make over the marker I may be able to invest in making an Art book as well. This however is not the focus, The Earthbound God is. 
The Perks, depending on how much you donate are:
Exclusive Desktop Wallpaper
 
Handdrawn Personalized Earthbound God Artwork of an animal of your choosing:

A Signed Pre-Ordered book!

 
All perks will be finished and sent out before September however I'm unable to give a percise date as some of these perks are personalized and will need time to make and then sent out. 
If I don’t reach my entire goal I should still be able to print some books, just in much smaller numbers, so any small amount will help.
Other Ways You Can Help:
If you can’t donated but still like to help out then please spread the word about this campaign.  Share with friends, on Facebook, Tumblr, Deviantart or Twitter whatever one you use.  The more people who know, the better! 
Also please support the comic by following the Earthbound God tumblr, where new info, concepts and detail of the book will be posted: http://theearthboundgod.tumblr.com/

<p><strong>Deos Rising </strong>is a new graphic novel written by <strong>Chris</strong> and <strong>David Edgerly</strong>, based on their feature length script, with artwork by <strong>David Edgerly</strong>. The story is ready to go and character and background design is already underway, but we need $10,000 to produce the complete issue and print copies.</p>
<p><strong>David Edgerly </strong>has worked in graphic design, illustration and animation for over ten years, and brings that experience to <strong>Deos Rising. Chris Edgerly </strong>has worked with <strong>David</strong> as a writing partner for years, and has a busy career as a voice actor in Los Angeles. </p>
<p>We think the screenplay would make a great movie, and it has a first-time director attached, but it's epic in scope, and that means big budget. With a graphic novel to help express the idea visually, we think there'll be no stopping us. </p>

<p><strong><br/></strong>With $10,000 in funding, that will give <strong>David </strong>the time and resources he needs to do this story justice. He's worked enough in the comic book world to know that you can't rush a job like this, and it'll take two to three months to create a professional quality issue. That will also cover the printing expenses as well.</p>
<p>We've created some really cool perks for different levels of donations as a nice incentive. Everyone who contributes at least five bucks gets a pdf of the issue, but contribute twenty and you get a first edition, printed copy! And it gets even cooler after that! We're also offering signed artwork, a chance to see yourself drawn into the story, and for a few incredibly generous donors, an entire page of signed artwork with computer-designed backgrounds!</p>
<p>But what if we don't reach our goal? That's always a possibility, but rest assured, no matter what we raise, <strong>David</strong> will use it as resources to produce as much of the issue as possible. There's even a plan to produce a condensed version of the story should we come up short. In other words, we don't give up easy.</p>

<p><strong><br/></strong>To us, this means the chance to tell a story we think people will love. Imagine a world with immortals and demons hiding in plain sight, and with only a small, super-secret cadre of guys like our hero to keep them from destroying everything in their wake. It's got action, adventure, a cool hero (with an inner conflict, of course), a wicked villain and an entire universe of gods and demons ready to go toe-to-toe with our main characters. And it's only the beginning - our screenplay is the first in a planned trilogy, so there's so much more story to tell! </p>
<p>And for you, the contributor, it means the chance to not only enjoy the story, but to know you helped make it happen! Not to mention some pretty nice perks if you donate enough!</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways to Help</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>We understand that not everyone can contribute funds, but they can help get the word out. Send this link to anyone you know that enjoys a great adventure story, or help us spread the word on Facebook or even around Indiegogo! It's a team effort, and we can't get there alone.

<h3>What kind of dog is this?</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is  Malin Falch and I am the artist and writer for the webcomic Zombie Waffe.</p>
<p>Zombie Waffe is a webcomic about a zombie apocalypse, and some guys struggling to survive it... lame summary, but it's more interesting than it sounds! (I hope)</p>
<p>ZW was a comic I started drawing about two years ago from now, I only did it for my own enjoyment, having always wanted to make a comic, but never gotten any far with my ideas, I set myself a goal that this, this comic wasn't gonna be scrapped.</p>
<p>And it wasn't! I have seen a huge interest from people since this comic started, and it really is the fuel that drives me to continue it, the best thing I know is to hear from people that they enjoy reading it, and wants to know what happens next! Even when my personal life takes over and updates are few, people still write to me, and makes me remember why I love making it.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>This stupid donation thing</strong></h3>
<p><strong><br/></strong>To explain this shortly, I just got out of high school and is heading to art university in the wonderful city San Francisco, to realize my dream about becoming an illustrator/comic artist/concept artist.</p>
<p>I have just moved to god knows where, and had gotten myself a job here that paid pretty well, until I got FIRED. Those moneys were pretty important for me as they were gonna pay for the plane tickets, as well as equipment for my uni experience.</p>
<p>So this is a last desperate attempt at making the money I would have made with my job this summer.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What do YOU benefit from this crap?</strong></h3>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>Now that I don't have a job anymore, I can focus a 100% on Zombie Waffe! That means UPDATES FOR EVERYONE!!!</p>
<p>I am very excited to start ZW up again, after the long break I had while I was finishing high school! </p>
<p>I have big plans for this comic, and going to art university will benefit this comic greatly! But don't worry, you don't have to donate for me to update zw, that is something I would have done anyways ;)</p>

The Savage Swordsman is already made with amazing reviews. And The Night of the Swordsman has never been released in print. So, this is a great way to support a fantastic comic. and the New Lady Swordsman comic is coming along nice. Meaning you can get three amazing comics and support the greatest comics label the world has ever seen.

Don't have the money to support this great comic? No problem. we have free comics available as Tyrant webcomics (You can read here) https://tyrantfreewebcomics.blogspot.com/2019/03/blog-post.html this alone is enough to overcome the Tyrants.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! I'm Nathan Fehr, creator of <a href=""http://interestingtimes.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Interesting Times</a>. I've been drawing for as long as I can remember, and wrote journal comics on a regular basis until June of this year. I loved getting to do it, and over time built a small but loyal fanbase. In 2012 I worked with my friends Steve &amp; Kayla to put a book together, and readers helped us fund the creation of an incredible hardcover collection of the best comics of the first two years.</p>
<p>It was exciting to make and I got a lot of positive feedback. <strong>But almost as soon as people had the first one they started asking: “So, when is volume two coming out?”</strong></p>
<p>I’ve said “Soon” a lot over the years, and meant it, but making books isn’t our day job and real life had a few other things for me and my friends to take care of first. Regardless, we kept meeting and working on bits and pieces of the book, and at long last I’m happy to report: <strong>Volume Two is ready to happen!</strong> The way things currently look, it should be in our hands by <u>February 2018!</u></p>
<p>...with a little more of your help, of course ;)</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>""Interesting Times: Year Three, Four &amp; Five""</strong> will contain the best Interesting Times comics printed in black and white on high quality 50 lb paper with hardcover and foil stamping. To get this done, we’ve once again reached out to <a href=""http://www.friesens.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Friesens</a>, a Southern Manitoba-based company that does high quality publishing work. They gave us a printing price per unit of $17.20, <strong>so in order to print 150 books we need $2580.</strong></p> <p>We kept all the proceeds from the first volume to help pay for this one, which means that <strong>even if we fall a little short of our goal we can still go forward with printing!</strong> This fundraising page is actually to serve as a sort of pre-order system for you, the reader. It’ll help us collect funds and compile your information to make fulfillment super easy when the book is in our hands early next year.</p>
<p>Once again, in return for your support we want to throw some cool extras at you! <strong>A $30 pledge guarantees you a physical copy of the book when it’s available</strong>. At $60, you get the Indiegogo exclusive Pirate Edition with custom drawings by the author AND the never-before-offered Interesting Times t-shirt! At the highest tier you can get a cool collection of banners, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/interestingtimescomic/photos/a.254424461238013.81243.234369593243500/1711101925570252/?type=3&amp;theater"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">just like this one</a>! (smiling author for scale)</p>
<p><strong><i>Please note: </i></strong>T-Shirts and framed banners are for <strong>local (Southern MB) pickup only</strong>. We can't afford to ship this stuff, sorry :(</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I’ve always been amazed and humbled that people made my comics a part of their day, and the creation of the first book was such an exciting extension of that. People responded in such a positive way to it, and it even attracted brand new readers who’d never heard of the site. So of course we want to continue the series, and achieve the ultimate dream: a row of books on shelves, representing the best of the whole run of Interesting Times!</p>
<p>For you, the impact is probably a lot like the first time around; this book will be something fun to have on the coffee table, something unique to have on the bookshelf, or (as before) just something stable to put a monitor on. Whatever motivates you, I want to thank you in advance for helping out. I know you're going to enjoy the finished product.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Spread the word about this campaign! Even if you don't contribute financially, tell somebody about it! You can link this page directly in whatever way you choose OR use IndieGoGo's share tools! It would be incredibly cool of you!</p>

</h3><br/><p>Townsville Comic Con is a Family Friendly Pop Culture Convention being held in Townsville, QLD on the 23rd April at the Townsville PCYC.</p><p>We

 are a group of Fans who have launched numerous campaigns over
 the last few years to try and get one of the established Pop Culture 
Conventions (Supanova, Oz Comic-Con etc...) in Australia to add more regional area's 
to their list of destinations. After little success we took it 
upon ourselves to organize Cairns's Very first Pop Culture Convention on July 11th 2015 called 
TropiCon. TropiCon was an overwhelming success and will be returning to Cairns on an annual basis. More than 400 people traveled from Townsville to be at TropiCon so in light of this we have decided to launch Townsville very own Pop Culture Convention in 2016! </p><p>We have worked tirelessly behind 
the scenes to ensure a great day for all attendees and guests. But now 
we turn to you for assistance.</p><p>Hosting a Con is no easy or cheap 
event. We have secured a number of high profile guests/celebrities who 
will be traveling from all over Australia and even internationally  to appear at Townsville Comic Con  . Some 
we have announced, many
we haven't. This crowd funding campaign will raise the funds needed to 
secure some of the guests appearances as well as contribute to to the 
cost of venue hire.</p><p>But we aren't asking you to donate money for 
nothing. Really all we are asking is for you to Pre-Purchase a ticket 
for the day. And we will throw in some sweet rewards too!</p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>Here is what you will get for your money:</p><ul>
<li>At the basic level you will get your Pre-Purchased ticket. <b>This will be your only chance to buy tickets at a discounted price and with no booking fees!</b>
</li>
<li>At the higher levels we have been very fortunate with some of our 
guests donating some cool rewards. Prints, sketch books, comics, all 
signed by their creators are available as rewards. As well as getting you an entry ticket.
</li>
</ul>We will use any money donated to us for the hire of the Venue, as 
well as pay for travel expenses and appearance fee's of the guests 
including some yet to be announced ones that will make you not regret 
helping us in the early days.<p>
</p><h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The idea of a Regional Pop Culture Convention is a dream held by all 
who live outside of a Capital City. With your help, both on this 
campaign and on the day, we can show the rest of Fandom that it can be 
done, and done well. </p>
<p>Even if you aren't a comic book person, maybe Anime, Video Games, TV 
&amp; Movies are your thing, don't worry, we have you covered too!</p>
<p>We have secured other guests that fit into these categories but we 
just cant announce them yet. We hope you have some faith and trust in us
 to show you all a great day. Remember, we are Fans too and know what 
you want!</p>

Townsville Comic Con is a Family Friendly Pop Culture Convention being held in Townsville, QLD on the 23rd April at the Townsville PCYC.We

 are a group of Fans who have launched numerous campaigns over
 the last few years to try and get one of the established Pop Culture 
Conventions (Supanova, Oz Comic-Con etc...) in Australia to add more regional area's 
to their list of destinations. After little success we took it 
upon ourselves to organize Cairns's Very first Pop Culture Convention on July 11th 2015 called 
TropiCon. TropiCon was an overwhelming success and will be returning to Cairns on an annual basis. More than 400 people traveled from Townsville to be at TropiCon so in light of this we have decided to launch Townsville very own Pop Culture Convention in 2016! We have worked tirelessly behind 
the scenes to ensure a great day for all attendees and guests. But now 
we turn to you for assistance.Hosting a Con is no easy or cheap 
event. We have secured a number of high profile guests/celebrities who 
will be traveling from all over Australia and even internationally  to appear at Townsville Comic Con  . Some 
we have announced, many
we haven't. This crowd funding campaign will raise the funds needed to 
secure some of the guests appearances as well as contribute to to the 
cost of venue hire.But we aren't asking you to donate money for 
nothing. Really all we are asking is for you to Pre-Purchase a ticket 
for the day. And we will throw in some sweet rewards too!What We Need & What You GetHere is what you will get for your money:
At the basic level you will get your Pre-Purchased ticket. This will be your only chance to buy tickets at a discounted price and with no booking fees!

At the higher levels we have been very fortunate with some of our 
guests donating some cool rewards. Prints, sketch books, comics, all 
signed by their creators are available as rewards. As well as getting you an entry ticket.

We will use any money donated to us for the hire of the Venue, as 
well as pay for travel expenses and appearance fee's of the guests 
including some yet to be announced ones that will make you not regret 
helping us in the early days.
The Impact
The idea of a Regional Pop Culture Convention is a dream held by all 
who live outside of a Capital City. With your help, both on this 
campaign and on the day, we can show the rest of Fandom that it can be 
done, and done well. 
Even if you aren't a comic book person, maybe Anime, Video Games, TV 
& Movies are your thing, don't worry, we have you covered too!
We have secured other guests that fit into these categories but we 
just cant announce them yet. We hope you have some faith and trust in us
 to show you all a great day. Remember, we are Fans too and know what 
you want!

<h3>What is Anonymi Press?</h3>
<p>Anonymi Press is the name of a small publishing company founded and headed by Christopher Ducharme. The company was established in 2012 for the purpose of self-publishing his own comic books and graphic novels.</p>
<p>Christopher has been an artist and avid comic lover since his youth, always dreaming of one day creating the same magic that captivated his own imagination. All through high school he spent hours dreaming up new worlds and characters, putting them in sticky situations that they would then need to find ways out of. Finally, entering adulthood, he put those imaginings on paper in the form of his first graphic story - the Tempest Moon.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2012, Anonymi launched it's first Indie Go Go campaign and successfully raised $500 from the campaign and $300 from personal contributors - successfully printing 100 copies of the first volume of the Tempest Moon.</p>
<p>Anonymi is once again seeking help in launching not just the next step in Sarah's fantasy adventure, but the next short comic series in the Anonymi repitoire. Christopher has been working with Spencer Campbell to illustrate a super power story about political corruption and cival war - a short comic series titled the Fallen.</p>
<p>By funding Anonymi Presses campaign, you will be helping contribute to the printing and shipping costs associated with the publication of the Tempest Moon volume 2 and the first issue of the Fallen, as well as costs associated with reprinting and shipping additional copies of the Tempest Moon volume 1.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Our goal and your reward</h3>
<p>Anonymi is requesting approximately $2000 to sustain the print-on-demand business partnership that the Press has with the comic printing company Ka-Blam! (<a href=""http://ka-blam.com/printing/front/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://ka-blam.com/printing/front/</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why Print-on-Demand?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It's simple - as a small time publishing company, self funding is limited to the owners personal income, contributions via funding campaign and profits made through the sales of the books. With the limited resources and exposure, it is more cost efficient to print when the demand is needed.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What's in it for you?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>By helping fund Anonymi, you will be eligible to receive copies of the books being offered under the Anonymi library, including the Tempest Moon volume's 1 and 2 (reduced from the actual cover price) and the Fallen #1. All books provided in fulfillment to this campaign will be signed (and personalized upon request).</p>
<p>Each book will be bagged and boarded, sealed with a custom Anonymi Press label and mailed - details on shipping practices to be determined.</p>
<p>A raffle will also be done for 1 of 3 original art peices - represented by each of the 3 books to be printed. A random drawing of contributors will be made. Winners of the drawing will be notified via email. Artwork will be drawn on 11x8.5 inch Bristol paper and mailed with the perk items provided from contributing.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What will the funding go toward?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Anonymi is hoping to raise $2000, which will help fully fund the printing costs of all 3 publications.</p>
<p>Last year, an order of 100 copies of Tempest Moon was printed, costing:</p>
<p><strong>Total Order:</strong> $729.96 ( Printing $505.00 + S&amp;H $224.96 )</p>
<p>Keep in mind the cost to print a single book is dependant on the number of pages, materials and other specifications provided by Ka-Blam! In turn, the shipping costs are relevent to the number of books shipped and the weight of said books.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Break down of costs:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Tempest Moon vol. 1 (100 copies) = $729.96<br/><br/>Tempest Moon vol. 2 (100 copies) = $729.96+ (may cost more as there are more pages in vol. 2 than were in vol. 1)</p>
The Fallen issue # 1 (100-200 copies) =$154.00 - $329.00 + shipping (TBD at time of shipping)
<p><em>We are also taking the care to individually board and bag each book. Boards and bags run approximately $10 for 100 (of each) - effectively costing $20 to board and bag 100 books. Considering we're looking to print 300-400 books, this is an additional cost that must be considered.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Total cost: $1888.92 </strong>approxmiately.<em><br/></em></p>

<p>Volume 1...</p>
<p><strong>Sarah likes to think she's a fairly normal girl. Being completely obsessed with books, she tends to immerse herself into fictional worlds about wizards and magic instead of dealing with reality. So when a stranger appears asking to speak to her father, she decides to dig into her parents past to find out who the mysterious man is. </strong></p>
<p><strong>She finds herself in the attic digging through her mothers old belongings, only to discover a book with strange markings and symbols. Being plunged into a dark secret of her mothers past, followed by a domino effect of unfolding events, she is left with a thought, shadowed by doubt...</strong><br/><br/><strong> Magic is real.</strong></p>

<p>Volume 2... (<em>no preview available at this time)</em></p>
<p><strong>The warlock has been released...</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sarah was a normal girl, living a bland life in a rural town. When a stranger appears asking for her father and a mysterious book appears in her attic, she is confronted with trouble at every turn. Now her brother is in grave danger and a maniacal warlock walks the Earth. Worst yet, he may not be the real threat. With new friends in tow, can they defeat the warlock before the next full moon? With her entire world crashing down around her, she still lives in doubt about her parents unknown past and a troubled thought, shadowed by doubt...<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Magic is real.<br/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Tempest Moon is the debut graphic series by Christopher Ducharme, about a teenaged girl who learns of a dark secret hidden for years by her parents. She is thrust into a world she never imagined existed - a world dominated by elmental magic. But The Tempest Moon is more than an urban fantasy tale about a girl who learns to manipulate magic to defeat an evil warlock - it is a coming of age tale, a story that concretes the foundation of friends and family and the ultimate concept of forgiving those close to you.</p>

<p>The Fallen is the second series offered by Anonymi - Illustrated by Christopher Ducharme and written by Spencer Campbell, the Fallen is a super hero story unlike any other - in the fact that those with super powers are not here to save the day.

</div></div>","What is Anonymi Press?
Anonymi Press is the name of a small publishing company founded and headed by Christopher Ducharme. The company was established in 2012 for the purpose of self-publishing his own comic books and graphic novels.
Christopher has been an artist and avid comic lover since his youth, always dreaming of one day creating the same magic that captivated his own imagination. All through high school he spent hours dreaming up new worlds and characters, putting them in sticky situations that they would then need to find ways out of. Finally, entering adulthood, he put those imaginings on paper in the form of his first graphic story - the Tempest Moon.
In the summer of 2012, Anonymi launched it's first Indie Go Go campaign and successfully raised $500 from the campaign and $300 from personal contributors - successfully printing 100 copies of the first volume of the Tempest Moon.
Anonymi is once again seeking help in launching not just the next step in Sarah's fantasy adventure, but the next short comic series in the Anonymi repitoire. Christopher has been working with Spencer Campbell to illustrate a super power story about political corruption and cival war - a short comic series titled the Fallen.
By funding Anonymi Presses campaign, you will be helping contribute to the printing and shipping costs associated with the publication of the Tempest Moon volume 2 and the first issue of the Fallen, as well as costs associated with reprinting and shipping additional copies of the Tempest Moon volume 1.


Our goal and your reward
Anonymi is requesting approximately $2000 to sustain the print-on-demand business partnership that the Press has with the comic printing company Ka-Blam! (http://ka-blam.com/printing/front/).

Why Print-on-Demand?

It's simple - as a small time publishing company, self funding is limited to the owners personal income, contributions via funding campaign and profits made through the sales of the books. With the limited resources and exposure, it is more cost efficient to print when the demand is needed.
 

What's in it for you?

By helping fund Anonymi, you will be eligible to receive copies of the books being offered under the Anonymi library, including the Tempest Moon volume's 1 and 2 (reduced from the actual cover price) and the Fallen #1. All books provided in fulfillment to this campaign will be signed (and personalized upon request).
Each book will be bagged and boarded, sealed with a custom Anonymi Press label and mailed - details on shipping practices to be determined.
A raffle will also be done for 1 of 3 original art peices - represented by each of the 3 books to be printed. A random drawing of contributors will be made. Winners of the drawing will be notified via email. Artwork will be drawn on 11x8.5 inch Bristol paper and mailed with the perk items provided from contributing.
 

What will the funding go toward?

Anonymi is hoping to raise $2000, which will help fully fund the printing costs of all 3 publications.
Last year, an order of 100 copies of Tempest Moon was printed, costing:
Total Order: $729.96 ( Printing $505.00 + S&H $224.96 )
Keep in mind the cost to print a single book is dependant on the number of pages, materials and other specifications provided by Ka-Blam! In turn, the shipping costs are relevent to the number of books shipped and the weight of said books.
 

Break down of costs:

Tempest Moon vol. 1 (100 copies) = $729.96Tempest Moon vol. 2 (100 copies) = $729.96+ (may cost more as there are more pages in vol. 2 than were in vol. 1)
The Fallen issue # 1 (100-200 copies) =$154.00 - $329.00 + shipping (TBD at time of shipping)
We are also taking the care to individually board and bag each book. Boards and bags run approximately $10 for 100 (of each) - effectively costing $20 to board and bag 100 books. Considering we're looking to print 300-400 books, this is an additional cost that must be considered.
 
Total cost: $1888.92 approxmiately.

Volume 1...
Sarah likes to think she's a fairly normal girl. Being completely obsessed with books, she tends to immerse herself into fictional worlds about wizards and magic instead of dealing with reality. So when a stranger appears asking to speak to her father, she decides to dig into her parents past to find out who the mysterious man is. 
She finds herself in the attic digging through her mothers old belongings, only to discover a book with strange markings and symbols. Being plunged into a dark secret of her mothers past, followed by a domino effect of unfolding events, she is left with a thought, shadowed by doubt... Magic is real.

Volume 2... (no preview available at this time)
The warlock has been released...
Sarah was a normal girl, living a bland life in a rural town. When a stranger appears asking for her father and a mysterious book appears in her attic, she is confronted with trouble at every turn. Now her brother is in grave danger and a maniacal warlock walks the Earth. Worst yet, he may not be the real threat. With new friends in tow, can they defeat the warlock before the next full moon? With her entire world crashing down around her, she still lives in doubt about her parents unknown past and a troubled thought, shadowed by doubt...
Magic is real.
 
The Tempest Moon is the debut graphic series by Christopher Ducharme, about a teenaged girl who learns of a dark secret hidden for years by her parents. She is thrust into a world she never imagined existed - a world dominated by elmental magic. But The Tempest Moon is more than an urban fantasy tale about a girl who learns to manipulate magic to defeat an evil warlock - it is a coming of age tale, a story that concretes the foundation of friends and family and the ultimate concept of forgiving those close to you.
 
""The world of comics needs more creators with the passion to make something from nothing and the willingness to get the story out by any means nessecary.  What you are reading is the first step, not only of a group of characters but of a creator.  I for one, look forward to the journey.""
-GMB Chomichuk - author and illustrator of the Imagination Manifesto (http://www.comicalchemy.blogspot.ca/)
 

"" A fast-paced tale that keeps you guessing, combined with unique, endearing characters, The Tempest Moon is sure to hook you from the start. I am definitely looking forward to reading more!""
 

-Tara Abbamondi, author of Puddles (http://www.tarabba.com/)
 
 
 

In a politically corrupt dystopia, one man with unnatural powers sets off to punish those in power. But what if he's not the only one with powers? Who will save the city of The Fallen?

Suggested for mature readers.
The Fallen is the second series offered by Anonymi - Illustrated by Christopher Ducharme and written by Spencer Campbell, the Fallen is a super hero story unlike any other - in the fact that those with super powers are not here to save the day. The powers are used to fulfill their own agenda's. It's a crude, bloody battle from the word go.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are trying to raise production costs for a new comic book written by James Leary.  Most of you may know James as Clem, from the Buffy The Vampire Slayer TV show.  What you don't know about James is that he is also a VERY talented writer and has always wanted to write a comic book!  This comic book will mark his debut with many more to come!  James has written a story titled Wolf Mother.  The story is being pencilled by the enigmatic fan favorite, Mitch Byrd.  Mitch has a talent with a pencil that no other can compare to.  Mitch is known for such great comics as Robocop, Predator, Starship Troopers, Green Lantern, Spawn, and various others.  His fantastic art style makes James' story really come to life.  The covers to this book are being done by Steve Scott.  Steve is known for pencilling Batman, JLA, and most recently Kirby Genesis Captain Victory.  He has also worked on numerous TV and movie related projects such as Smallville, Kyle XY and Batman The Dark knight.  He is also featured in the upcoming Justice League: Doom DVD.</p>

<p>I am KP Crayon (Karen Parish) an up and coming Christian/Clean Comedienne.  I have discovered the joy of stand up comedy.  The above video shows my very first ever performance.  I have been told that I was funny all of my life, but I never actually considered comedy to be a vocational option for me...until now.  After my first performance, I received lots of positive feedback, and doors have begun to open for me. </p>
<p>I wish I could describe for you the energy that I feel when standing before a crowd, and making them laugh.  With so many unfunny things going on in the world, I find that people are looking for an outlet to laugh and have a good time.  I have chosen clean comedy because I  think people, just like me, want to enjoy evenings out with the entire family...kids and all.</p>

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>Some of you may know me personally and some of you may know me from roles that I have played on screen. Well, I am so excited to introduce you to a wonderful project that I have been working on the last couple of months. CeCe in Harlem is the children's book series that I created which accompanies a musical I wrote called HARLEM! I am proud to announce our first book, ""Presenting CeCe's Big Break"" has broken through and already a success amongst young readers and their parents.</p>
<p>The series follows CeCe, a chorus girl a big-eyed dreamer,during the Harlem Renaissance. A laundress by day and a Cotton Club chorus girl by night, CeCe has big dreams. Her dream become a reality when she meets Billy, a scout who discovers her and takes her to Broadway.</p>
<p>It only takes that one moment for your life to change right?</p>
<p>There's a little bit of CeCe in all of us.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Aforementioned, we launched our first book via e-book and it is available through Amazon, I-tunes, and Nook. Right now our aim is to get our book into print.</p>
<p>Not going through a publisher, creates a cost inflation we cant cover so we need your help. No matter how much we make, we will use it to print our books. Even if its 3.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There are very few children's books for girls of color that remind them of their beauty and talents. Our book showcases characters from different nationalities, which is reflective of the diverse world we live in. Your contribution will mean that we get a chance to push other stories into the mainstream.</p>
<p>We have sold 50 books via e-book which for us is a GREAT start.</p>
<p>Some of you might know that I volunteer with an after-school tutoring organization called 826la. They have graciously offered to host a book launch where a portion of the proceeds will go towards the non-profit.</p>

<div>Thank you so much and we look forward to making our dream into a reality!</div></div>","Hello!
Some of you may know me personally and some of you may know me from roles that I have played on screen. Well, I am so excited to introduce you to a wonderful project that I have been working on the last couple of months. CeCe in Harlem is the children's book series that I created which accompanies a musical I wrote called HARLEM! I am proud to announce our first book, ""Presenting CeCe's Big Break"" has broken through and already a success amongst young readers and their parents.
The series follows CeCe, a chorus girl a big-eyed dreamer,during the Harlem Renaissance. A laundress by day and a Cotton Club chorus girl by night, CeCe has big dreams. Her dream become a reality when she meets Billy, a scout who discovers her and takes her to Broadway.
It only takes that one moment for your life to change right?
There's a little bit of CeCe in all of us.


What We Need & What You Get
Aforementioned, we launched our first book via e-book and it is available through Amazon, I-tunes, and Nook. Right now our aim is to get our book into print.
Not going through a publisher, creates a cost inflation we cant cover so we need your help. No matter how much we make, we will use it to print our books. Even if its 3.


The Impact
There are very few children's books for girls of color that remind them of their beauty and talents. Our book showcases characters from different nationalities, which is reflective of the diverse world we live in. Your contribution will mean that we get a chance to push other stories into the mainstream.
We have sold 50 books via e-book which for us is a GREAT start.
Some of you might know that I volunteer with an after-school tutoring organization called 826la. They have graciously offered to host a book launch where a portion of the proceeds will go towards the non-profit.


Other Ways You Can Help
We need to get the word out there that we are sitting  on this hidden gem. CeCe is a character that will be around for long time, so if there is any means to promote our story we gladly will appreciate it!

<p><b>For the first time in hundreds of years, Finn's</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> legend is retold. Forged anew from the breath of the storyteller, but this time it's different... This time the fireside is the modern world. This time, it's in the form of a Graphic Novel.

<p><b><b>Finn McCool was the legendary protector of Ireland</b> <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">and Chief of The Fianna, the elite bodyguard to the High Kings of Ireland. Finn and The Fianna's heroic adventures and deeds are well known within the Irish community and if you reference, Finn McCool, you will see, not only the vast amount of links to his mythology, but also the many pubs, restaurants, organizations and clubs, that celebrate his noble name. What you will not see, is the Graphic Novel of the hero, that, my friends, is about to change. </span><br/></b></p>

<p><b>The stories of Finn McCool </b>do just that, they teach. This is part of the drive behind the graphic novel series, also to showcase the real heroes of our past, rather than the constant ""Superman v Batman"" overkill.

<p><b>We are producing of the Hardcover Original Graphic Novel</b>, featuring the retelling of Finn’s
origin. In order to hire the best writers, pencillers, inkers, colourists and
letterers in the business to bring this vision to life, we need your support.
Our plan is to raise the money to be able to hire top-notch creative talent
from the comic and graphic novel field and to partner with an
American Comic Book publisher, Archaia, in order to distribute the graphic novel to comic and bookstores across the world.  </p>

This time the fireside is the modern world. This time, it's in the form of a Graphic Novel. Now you have the chance to become part of that heroic quest, the journey of immortality, by remembering - The Nobility of our Irish Heroes.



Finn McCool was the legendary protector of Ireland and Chief of The Fianna, the elite bodyguard to the High Kings of Ireland. Finn and The Fianna's heroic adventures and deeds are well known within the Irish community and if you reference, Finn McCool, you will see, not only the vast amount of links to his mythology, but also the many pubs, restaurants, organizations and clubs, that celebrate his noble name. What you will not see, is the Graphic Novel of the hero, that, my friends, is about to change. 
The time has come to honour our ancient Irish heroes and in the highest way possible - by putting their fine names on the lips of true clansmen and women the world over. Part of our vision for the novel is for young men and women to read them, as well as adults, to learn more about their heritage, rites of passage and initiations into adulthood, something we feel is sadly lacking in today's world. 
The stories of Finn McCool do just that, they teach. This is part of the drive behind the graphic novel series, also to showcase the real heroes of our past, rather than the constant ""Superman v Batman"" overkill. This is an original project, a one off, you can be part of this fantastic journey.

We are producing of the Hardcover Original Graphic Novel, featuring the retelling of Finn’s
origin. In order to hire the best writers, pencillers, inkers, colourists and
letterers in the business to bring this vision to life, we need your support.
Our plan is to raise the money to be able to hire top-notch creative talent
from the comic and graphic novel field and to partner with an
American Comic Book publisher, Archaia, in order to distribute the graphic novel to comic and bookstores across the world.  
       
Above we see Fiacuil, Finn's warrior mentor and the dreaded, Goll Mc Morna, the man who murders Finn's father, a conflict indeed  ...


Above is Saba Priestess of the underworld and Finn's true love. Saba first comes to Finn in the form of a white deer, cursed so by the dark lord of the underworld. Finn lifts the curse and we see here, Saba transformed back into the beautiful woman she is.
Below is the magical druid Finegas, another wise mentor of Finn's. He teaches Finn the value of the earth and the magic that she holds. Finegas also catches the fames, ""Salomon of knowledge.""

""You've seen the Movies 'Braveheart', 'Rob Roy', 'Highlander' and recently, the Pixar animation, 'Brave'.  All great and have one thing in common; they're Scottish. The magic, power and beauty that is Irish Story and Myth has seemingly been overlooked by Hollywood and the world, but not any longer - Irish legends and its Heroes deserve a place in our hearts with the graphic novel and up on the Big Screen.
Below we see the Boy Finn's first day of warrior initiation with his wild mentor, Fiacuil.

This ground breaking project will lead the way in the reemergence of the Irish Celtic Warrior Heroes. It will become part of your story, your history, not only for you, but for your ancestors. By honouring them, you honour the past, by honouring the past, you become the hero ...
Below we see Finn's first encounter with the magical druid, Finegas.Together we can forge a new wave of Heroes ... and this time it's IRISH and the Greatest Irish Hero there ever was, Finn McCool. Below we see the moment that Finn is forced to face death, in more ways than one ...     ""When you are dust, how will you be remembered?""By supporting this project you will literally create for yourself, and kin, a lasting legacy that you can feel deeply proud of.

<p>Bio: Once a prisoner aboard a giant ship known as Lainhardt Omega in another universe, along with her mother, Zahra Melech-Goodman. After a failed coup against the powers that be in Lainhardt Omega, Celes and her co-conspirators were sentenced to death by airlock ejection. Due to coming in contact with a cosmic substance known as Dark Matter during an experiment years ago, her body underwent a slow change. Consequently, Celes' latent reality warping powers emerged along with receiving an exponential boost to her current psychokinetic abilities. This power boost with new found abilities ultimately saved Celes and her friends from certain doom.

<p>Occupation: Adventurer</p>
<p>Bio: Born to an aristocratic family in the city of Roanoke. Glen and his fellow humans are the first to arrive in PowerLand, all of which instances were through various mysterious circumstances. Glen spent his time exploring this vast new world, eventually becoming good friends with Andrew, Kita, and Mackie before the war started. Unbeknownst to humans, their existence would spark the beginning of the Anomaly-Nexus War. Fearing for their lives, Roanoke, in conjunction with a handful of other human-only cities, signed legislature forbidding their citizens from leaving their cities as isolationist city-states. Furthermore, all foreigners would be met with hostility and exiled from human owned towns. These laws, though, didn't stop Glen and his adventurous spirit. As a result of his rebelliousness, Roanoke’s leaders exiled him from their city. Glen soon met Zini, a fellow exile, and together with Andrew, Kita, and Mackie, stood against the genocidal Anomaly Regime.</p>

<p>Bio: Son of Andrew Rayne I, AKA: Grandmaster Reign I. Aspiring to be like his father by joining the Ancient Power Council was his life long goal. This all came to an end when assassins from the Anomaly Regime killed Queen Miranda Nexus and the entire Ancient Power Council, including Andrew's father. Without the wise men and Queen Nexus leading the way, the Nexus people were lost. It took a leap of faith for them to trust the young Andrew II and his FireFang. At the time, FireFang consisted of himself, his future wife, Kita, and future queen of the Nexus people, Mackie. Andrew was always known to lead, even in technological breakthroughs. One being the Diamond Power Forging (DPF) technology that combined the diamond mineral with the cosmic element, Dark Matter, for extraordinary effects. As the leader of FireFang, Andrew's leadership skills in this small militia group, all armed with the revolutionary DPF weaponry, turned the tide of the Anomaly-Nexus War. All of this was done also with the help of Zini and Celes, thus paving the way for a better future so newer generations could prosper. Centuries since then, FireFang kept their vow in protecting the people from any and all threats lurking within PowerLand. As for his patented DPF, many developed nations across the planet run factories and power plants using it in modern times.</p>

THIEVES
of EDEN is a graphic novel thriller to SAVE REALITY from ENEMIES of LIFE! 
This high concept story exploded into comic life when I met artist Chris
Hopkins. Adapted from my fiction thriller book, Issue #1 is now available at www.thievesofeden.com, where you can also see a
free teaser.  We hope you'll want to subscribe too! 

We ignite curiosity with humor, beautiful characters, outrageous art and wild story twists.  Are there really ""ENEMIES of LIFE""?  Is REALITY itself in danger?

THE PLOT
Awareness
becomes action that unites people and purpose as four characters meet and
discover they are a game – THE GAME – for the very life of our planet.  Their opponents, with a 6,000 year advantage,
are about to trigger Earth’s end (for perfectly good business reasons!) with a final environmental death clench as their game-winning move.
To
quickly stop these Enemies of Life, the four must cooperate and find rare
knowledge closely guarded by elders in their respective sacred traditions.  
Battling powerful
forces of evil they must connect ancient wisdom puzzles with
cutting-edge science to form an unusual energy device, the source of
unexplained “miracles” hidden to all but an elite few throughout history.

Who
blocked this knowledge and why?
OUR PURPOSE
This “who done it mystery” unveils a story that connects new
sciences like bio-physics (how human energy fields operate as cellphones!) and
rare knowledge from my personal trainings with authentic Native American Medicine
Men, Chinese Qigong (Energy) Masters and other amazing lineage holders of genuine wisdom traditions.  
The great privilege of training for many years comes with a real responsibility to share what I've been given.  I'm told my gift is communicating this knowledge in ways that easily integrate science, wisdom, spirituality, energy and physiology into practical stuff.

My
goal is to usher in a WISDOM tsunami with big fun!  From ancient to futuristic, rare knowledge is now needed to illuminate the treasures of different cultures, traditions and peoples that can possibly win THE GAME.  
What if... pollution, environmental collapse, financial frenzies, political obstruction, privacy and more are all connected?  If so, what are the real motives?  Who controls them?  What can people do against such powerful forces?  In other words, is THE GAME for the very life of our planet REAL?!?  If so, on which side are YOU?  Awake or asleep?  
How do you PLAY?  And WIN?

THIEVES of EDEN is multi-dimensional.  It grows understanding beyond the

designed to uplift lives, open hearts and deepen minds – so that we can make better

""THINK PRANKS"" - SAVE REALITY CAMPAIGNS
As a comic book for progressives, and as a low-budget alternative to think tanks, we added an exciting new venue - a ""comic within the comic"" that our main character reads.  We'll utilize this to enliven today's issues with mind-opening humor that untwists reality from outrageous absurdity and non-stop spin.   Check out our first campaign at:

<p>Hello, you beautiful soul. As the video states, my birthday is coming up. The big 3-0. I can't believe it either. While I know it is tradition to send the birthday person into a drunken stupor, my preference is to remember the night and the great people that were there.

My Super Bowl Commercial
Hello, you beautiful soul. As the video states, my birthday is coming up. The big 3-0. I can't believe it either.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Hello everyone, my name is John Gallagher,</p>
<p>I am here in representation of our newly created company called White Cat Comics.</p>
<p>After Comicsgate we realize that we have to take matters into our own hands and bring our stories to life without all of the political nonsense and agendas.</p>
<p>We believe that above all comics should be fun! I grew up with them, I love them and I´m passionate about this, so it breaks my heart to see the industry that has brought me so much joy struggle the way it is struggling. Because we love comics so much, we are working on comics which are fun. exciting and above all.. very fun!</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy our first ever project called The Grim Reaper. </p>

<h2> </h2>
<h2><strong>What is The Grim Reaper about?</strong></h2>
<p>This 35 pages comic tells the story of the Grim Reaper when Azrael, the angel of death, passes on the mantle to a fearless soldier named Manfred.</p>
<p>When he becomes the new reaper, he is faced with many challenges as he learns how to use his powers. His children who also share some of his powers begin to grow out of his control, causing chaos and destruction wherever they go.</p>

</div></div>","Overview
Hello everyone, my name is John Gallagher,
I am here in representation of our newly created company called White Cat Comics.
After Comicsgate we realize that we have to take matters into our own hands and bring our stories to life without all of the political nonsense and agendas.
We believe that above all comics should be fun! I grew up with them, I love them and I´m passionate about this, so it breaks my heart to see the industry that has brought me so much joy struggle the way it is struggling. Because we love comics so much, we are working on comics which are fun. exciting and above all.. very fun!
We hope you enjoy our first ever project called The Grim Reaper. 

 
What is The Grim Reaper about?
This 35 pages comic tells the story of the Grim Reaper when Azrael, the angel of death, passes on the mantle to a fearless soldier named Manfred.
When he becomes the new reaper, he is faced with many challenges as he learns how to use his powers. His children who also share some of his powers begin to grow out of his control, causing chaos and destruction wherever they go.
Humans believe that they have learned how to bring people back from the dead, but instead end up creating a soulless Frankensteinian monster which will end up terrorizing an entire city.
 

The children of death:
The children of death are supernatural beings, children of the grim reaper who have both supernatural powers and weapons given to them by their father. They will try to stop the mad scientists who are hell-bent on bringing people back from the afterlife, despite their father’s reluctance to get involved.



Characters:
In this first issue, we will have the appearance of some of the most iconic characters in history such as Vlad Tepes, the titans of ancient Greek mythology, the legendary war-pilot known as the ""Red Baron"", and many more! 





What We Need & What You Will Get:
Here is the deal, this project is almost done, but we need your help to print, distribute and to pay the team of professionals who have worked on it. I myself have written the story, while the illustrations were made by Santiago Gutierrez and the co illustrator, coloring, lettering, and overall editions by Carla Tornielli. 

We have some very unique perks for all of the lovers of horror and mystery graphic novels.
The funds will go towards inking, coloring, printing and distributing.

 


 
Risks? I don´t think so...

All of my team and I take pride in our work and will go to great lengths to have it delivered to you. We are very serious about deadlines, so please understand that not only do we see this as our responsibility, but also as our biggest dream in life coming true. A happy backer is definitely part of it.  We are packed with planned updates and communications, so you will always be on the know about everything that happens with the project!
 

 
Other Ways You Can Help:

We understand that sometimes you cannot contribute with money. But even if that's the case, you can still help us by spreading the word telling your friends and family, and following us on social media!

</p><p><b>VERSION EN CASTELLANO</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hola gente. Mi nombre es Adrian Minkowicz. Soy un comediante argentino haciendo stand-up en dos idiomas, Inglés y Castellano. He tenido el privilegio de actuar en tres continentes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>En 2007 escribí y actúe mi primer solo show de stand-up comedy en castellano en el Foro Gandhi de la famosa Avenida Corrientes en Buenos Aires en llamado ""Uno solo, rapidito y de parado"". En 2008 seguí haciendo funciones de este show en Argentina e internacionalmente, en España.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Poco después empecé a hacer stand-up en Inglés. En 2011 me ""pasaron” en el legendario ""Comic Strip Live"" en Nueva York. También soy el único argentino en ganar el ""Lotery Show"" en esta mecca de la comedia. Esto me llevó a actuar en los clubes más importantes de Nueva York y Los Ángeles como ""Gotham Comedy Club"" e “Improv”, entre otros clubes icónicos. También empecé a hacer stand-up en inglés en Europa; España, Bélgica, Holanda, Noruega, Finlandia, Francia, Alemania Reino Unido y Bulgaria, y una gira en Asia, incluyendo China, Japón y Hong Kong. También actué en festivales como el ""Just for Laughs"" y el ""Fringe"" de Edimburgo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ahora, 8 años después de mi primer show, estoy orgulloso de anunciar que voy a tener mi primer solo de stand-up comedy en Inglés en el “Fringe Festival” de Escocia llamado “The Argentinean in Edinburgh” (El argentino en Edimburgo). Estoy muy contento con esto, pero la competencia aquí es salvaje! El ”Fringe"" es uno de los festivales más grandes del mundo, con más de 3.000 espectáculos en un poco más de 3 semanas. No es un error de tipeo. Más de 3 k de espectáculos en un poco mas de 20 días.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nunca hubiera sido nunca capaz de hacer nada de esto sin la ayuda de familia, amigos y fans que apoyan mis sueños. Es por eso que, por primera vez empiezo esta campaña de fondos para apoyar mi aventura escocesa.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Creo que el stand-up necesita nutrirse the comediantes internacionales con diferentes puntos de vista y que estoy seguro de que yo tengo una perspectiva única que puedo compartir con el mundo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>En el mismo tono que mi primer show, yo soy el único productor. He hecho todos las presentaciones, folletos, información, página web, etc. Todo ello con ayuda de amigos y familiares a los que estoy eternamente agradecido!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Puesto que es un presupuesto ajustado el dinero será utilizado para el alquiler, los gastos generales del día a día y la promoción básica del espectáculo. Si hay un excedente será utilizado para cubrir la totalidad de los costos de producción, para comprar más volantes y carteles para el “Fringe”, y promover las futuras actuaciones del show en el Reino Unido y los EE.UU..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Espero que Ustedes decidan apoyar financieramente el show. Y, por favor siganme en las redes sociales !! Confío en el ""boca a boca"" para que la gente venga al show. Me pueden seguir en Instagram, Twitter y Youtube: @adrianminkowicz y en Facebook como “The Argentinean”.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gracias y nos vemos!</p><p>Adrian</p><p></p></div>","ENGLISH VERSION (VERSION EN CASTELLANO MAS ABAJO)Hello Everyone! My name is Adrian Minkowicz.

Hola gente. Mi nombre es Adrian Minkowicz. Soy un comediante argentino haciendo stand-up en dos idiomas, Inglés y Castellano. He tenido el privilegio de actuar en tres continentes.

En 2007 escribí y actúe mi primer solo show de stand-up comedy en castellano en el Foro Gandhi de la famosa Avenida Corrientes en Buenos Aires en llamado ""Uno solo, rapidito y de parado"". En 2008 seguí haciendo funciones de este show en Argentina e internacionalmente, en España.

Poco después empecé a hacer stand-up en Inglés. En 2011 me ""pasaron” en el legendario ""Comic Strip Live"" en Nueva York. También soy el único argentino en ganar el ""Lotery Show"" en esta mecca de la comedia. Esto me llevó a actuar en los clubes más importantes de Nueva York y Los Ángeles como ""Gotham Comedy Club"" e “Improv”, entre otros clubes icónicos. También empecé a hacer stand-up en inglés en Europa; España, Bélgica, Holanda, Noruega, Finlandia, Francia, Alemania Reino Unido y Bulgaria, y una gira en Asia, incluyendo China, Japón y Hong Kong. También actué en festivales como el ""Just for Laughs"" y el ""Fringe"" de Edimburgo.

Ahora, 8 años después de mi primer show, estoy orgulloso de anunciar que voy a tener mi primer solo de stand-up comedy en Inglés en el “Fringe Festival” de Escocia llamado “The Argentinean in Edinburgh” (El argentino en Edimburgo). Estoy muy contento con esto, pero la competencia aquí es salvaje! El ”Fringe"" es uno de los festivales más grandes del mundo, con más de 3.000 espectáculos en un poco más de 3 semanas. No es un error de tipeo. Más de 3 k de espectáculos en un poco mas de 20 días.

Nunca hubiera sido nunca capaz de hacer nada de esto sin la ayuda de familia, amigos y fans que apoyan mis sueños. Es por eso que, por primera vez empiezo esta campaña de fondos para apoyar mi aventura escocesa.

Creo que el stand-up necesita nutrirse the comediantes internacionales con diferentes puntos de vista y que estoy seguro de que yo tengo una perspectiva única que puedo compartir con el mundo.

En el mismo tono que mi primer show, yo soy el único productor. He hecho todos las presentaciones, folletos, información, página web, etc. Todo ello con ayuda de amigos y familiares a los que estoy eternamente agradecido!

Puesto que es un presupuesto ajustado el dinero será utilizado para el alquiler, los gastos generales del día a día y la promoción básica del espectáculo. Si hay un excedente será utilizado para cubrir la totalidad de los costos de producción, para comprar más volantes y carteles para el “Fringe”, y promover las futuras actuaciones del show en el Reino Unido y los EE.UU..

Espero que Ustedes decidan apoyar financieramente el show. Y, por favor siganme en las redes sociales !! Confío en el ""boca a boca"" para que la gente venga al show. Me pueden seguir en Instagram, Twitter y Youtube: @adrianminkowicz y en Facebook como “The Argentinean”.

Gracias y nos vemos!Adrian",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>I've had some issues with people donating instead of choosing a perk, as of today people who donate instead of buying a perk aren't guaranteed a book. I'm sorry, I know the site is confusing, and if I could turn off donations I would, but I'm losing money on these mistakes. Please select and buy a perk with appropriate shipping. </strong></p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm known online as Commander Hot Pants and I make Mass Effect fan content. For nearly the past year, this has included the production of a webcomic called Chasing the Sun. </p>
<p>The comic started as a five page proof of concept I made on a lark over one weekend, but the reception was so positive I created more and more. Right now, there's 130 pages and counting, with no end in sight. The production of this comic has become important to me in many ways and seeing my work in print is a dream.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I currently have a printing quote where I can get 25 books printed at $15 a piece, two of these books are already spoken for. I'm looking to sell these books at cost plus shipping to anyone who wants to support my work. If you purchase a pre-order of this, not only will you get the book at cost, you'll also get your name (or username) on the thank you page of the print. If you'd like me to sign the copy, or write a note please indicate and I will do so. </p>
<p>The book itself will be 120 pages, full colour, <strong>8*10*</strong>, 'perfect' bound with a glossy soft cover. This book will include a page of exclusive-to-print content which has never, and will never, be shared online. </p>
<p>I'm not expecting to ever do a second print, so this might be your only chance to acquire a physical copy.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Spread the word for me! Share this project with friends, post it into Mass Effect groups you're a part of, tell people about it. And of course, I'm also happy to take donations towards the printing if the price is too steep.</p>

Requiem of the Crazies tells the story of a man named Dante, who after losing his job and home, is cast out of his mundane life and into the strange underground world of the homeless. Being mentored by a veteran bum named Vernon, our two protagonists begin to uncover a dark reality about the homeless community in which they live. 
IN PART 2 
The true motivation behind the creation of the 'City of Bums' is revealed...    
A corrupt city politician. A dark deal between devilish people. War between drug dealers.

Every vote counts, and their numbers are high.  The bums are starving, but thankfully charity organizations like SAFE HAVEN provide them with canned food and fresh water.  God bless them!

When Universes
Collide: Vendetta For Victory ""Let The Games Begin""
Two powerful warriors from DC Universe and the world of Dragonball Z have been
unleashed upon each other & only one will emerge the victor.


We have been looking to create versus film for a long time and now a lot
factors are coming together for us to do one.  Our goal of $500 will be
used to cover the costs of costumes.  Of course the more money we are able
to put in the project the more energetic this video will be.
Location of the shoot
will be around the Middle Georgia area.  It is scheduled to take place
around August 2014.  A few things have already been locked down such as
locations, costume builders are set and ready to go and fighting coordinator as
we have been doing some pre-planning since February.  Therefore we have implemented
all of the aspects we could that could be done with no budget.  If we do
not meet our goal we continue, but to deliver a completed film we need have
funds in place.Who We Are
In world of film there
many people in much bigger places doing this.  However, we just so happen
to be located in the middle of nothing shooting short films & feature
films.  We are very passionate about the work we are doing and wish to
share our work with the world.  Hopefully, we can inspire others to pick
up a camera and create a world of their own.What We Need & What You Get
This is a 100%
NON-PROFIT photo shoot/video.  All the people involved in this project are
giving their talent and time free of charge.  All funds will directly fund
the costumes builds, food, any location fees, accommodation for the actresses
and post work.

and if we have the support we plan to make other versus films.  Perhaps
even a sequel to this, but we need your help for that :)

<font size=""3""><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">An entertaining giggle-tastic tome! * Brilliantly written! Humour that goes where most dare not tread, and worth every page! * A LOL on every page! * Top notch work! </span><br/><br/>These were just a handful of the comments I received on my 2009 comic book ""Glory Be!"" - the refreshingly funny ""Christian satire"" book that will literally make you LOL (laugh out loud). It's biting humour aimed at everyday (and every Sunday) church folk also extends to everyday secular folk - so nobody is left out in the cold. <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Glory Be!</span> crosses all boundaries and no matter what you believe, believe me - you'll chortle, guffaw or snigger.</span> </font><font size=""3"">Perhaps even a combination of all three.</font>
</h3>
<h3>
<font size=""3"">My Story</font><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""""><br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">My love of comics began back in the 70s. Books like </span>Mr Men<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">, </span>The Munch Bunch<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> and </span>The Blobs <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">all inspired me, so I doodled cartoons for much of my childhood, and at every available opportunity... which was often frowned upon in Maths lessons.</span></span><font size=""3""><br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Being skinny and ginger circa 1985 had me at a disadvantage, and I'd often come home from school and cry over the dog. Thankfully my fantasy land got me through. I bought comics by the dozen and found myself enchanted by this fictional wonderland. So I'd create my own characters and lead them on their own zany adventures. Perhaps my proudest moment was winning first prize for a poster I designed in Science (of all lessons). It depicted crazy characters getting up to all sorts of tomfoolery in the classroom, and my teacher thought it could run and run. That day my existence had been justified, and my destiny beckoned.</span></font><br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Today I'm launching the second of my </span>Glory Be!<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> comic books. The reviews of the first book were better than I could have wished for, so writing another was never going to be easy. I'm delighted that I now have an altogether more 'focused' book than the first. In fact it metaphorically rocks. While </span>Glory Be!<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> is certainly not a children's comic, it's no </span>Viz<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> either. Much of the content is far too highbrow, sarcastic, or tongue-in-cheek for younger audiences to understand â€“ which is why it carries the ""mature readers"" tag. Besides, even if younger readers don't fully appreciate the irony, I'm sure they'll delight in perusing the pictures.</span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/><br/></span>Glory Be!<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> also features the adventures of </span>Norton Mouse<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">, the loveable little rodent with a penchant for purple sweaters and tweeting. He's followed by a wide variety of people, including Jonathan Ross, Phillip Schofield and Lisa Faulkner (to namedrop just a few). In his eponymous(e) comic you'll also get to meet a few of his mousey pals and nephew, Nelson, as they partake in hilarious antics.</span><br/><br/>So what is Glory Be?<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In a nutshell - it's a comic based around a dysfunctional church by the name of Riverdale. Straight away you may hear church bells and assume it's ""religious"" or ""preachy"" but it's neither. It's just a book about a modern, charismatic church community and all the characters within that community. Of course like any cartoon it's a distorted, vastly exaggerated representation of real life. So it's also really funny. </span><br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We have characters like Judgemental Jonah â€“ who lunges his sword of judgement into his fellow Christians but fails to see his own short-comings, Barry Boaster - who does good deeds, only to boast about it for praise from his fellow man - and Steve O'Grady, a man who wears a sheet over his face because he's too ashamed to be seen as a Christian. Meanwhile, Pastor Peter Loftus endures lots of ""face palm"" moments as he struggles to lead his Machiavellian and troublesome flock down the narrow path.</span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/><br/></span>Book 2: Chariots of Ire<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> focuses on Riverdale's preparations for the Christian Olympics, but all is not well in camp. There's bickering, in-fighting, personal pride and resentment throughout - and that's before the enemy really sticks its claws in. The enemy being the Satanist church around the corner who plot to derail the Olympics and bring about the downfall of the pesky Christians. Meanwhile Pastor Peter enlists Norton Mouse to be the Riverdale team mascot, but this brings disquiet within the ranks, mostly from Judgemental Jonah, who believes Norton is a ""demon"" from the ninth circle of hell.</span><br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">You can pigeon-hole </span>Glory Be!<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> as a ""Christian"" comic but that's not strictly true. Yes, it has an underlying Christian ethos, but it's mostly about a group of people from all walks of life (who may not even like each other) who are thrown together for a greater good. A non-believer/non-churchgoer would actually garner as much from </span>Glory Be!<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> as a devout Christian. In fact for some Christians, this sails far too close to the wind for their liking. This is church life - warts and all. </span><font size=""3"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/><br/>There really isn't a comic book out there like Glory Be! We've had comics about the dysfunctional family, workplace, school, etc over the years but none (to my knowledge) that focuses on a church congregation. We've had comedies like ""The Vicar of Dibley"" and ""Rev"", but they're different animals altogether. </font><font size=""3""><br style=""font-weight: normal;""/><br style=""font-weight: normal;""/><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I believe </span>Glory Be!<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> will open a lot of doors and change peoples perceptions of Christians and church on the whole. Everyday (mostly on Twitter) I read something aimed at Christians which is built upon sheer ignorance. Usually some cringe inducing dross they've seen on TV or a Bible scripture they've glanced at and taken out of all context. I suspect Judgemental Jonah will ruffle lots of feathers, but here's one of those characters who you laugh at and not with. I'm sure people will appreciate the irony...</span></font><font size=""3""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span><br/>Glory Be!<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> isn't going to save your soul â€“ and nor will it convert you to atheism. It's simply unconventional (and rather un-PC) entertainment that is designed to make you laugh - or at least chortle.</span></font><font size=""3"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/><br/>What I Need &amp; What You Get</font><font size=""3"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/><br/>I'm aiming to print 2,000 copies of a 68 page ""Glory Be! Book 2"" which will include a 16 page ""Norton Mouse"" comic - in total 84 pages. This will cost just over Â£3000 alone. Your money will go directly to the printing costs of this book. Advertising and distribution could cost another Â£1,000, but I will be advertising with great care. I'll also be using my own money for printing/promotion, but if I raise MORE than I need I certainly won't waste it by adding an extra 16 pages of nonsense. Additional funds will rollover to the next book.</font><font size=""3""><br/><br/>So what happens if I don't raise my target?</font><font size=""3""><br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In this case the page count will just have to decrease, and I'll be spending sleepless nights deliberating over what pages should be left on the bedroom floor. 36 and 48 page editions are also a possibility, it's just that 68 pages have been written. Failure to reach the target may also result in the <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Norton Mouse</span> comic being put on the back-burner. </span></font><font size=""3"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/><br/>As <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Book 2: Chariots of Ire</span> is based upon the 2012 Olympics, launching it any later than July would be akin to locking the gate once the horse has bolted. Therefore the provisional release date is July 7th 2012, when I will be appearing at the London Film and Comic Con at Olympia (which seems apt). Although I will be taking pre-orders once I know the page count.</font><font size=""3"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Other Ways You Can Help</span></font><br style=""font-weight: normal;""/><br style=""font-weight: normal;""/><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">If you've read this far you obviously care enough about this project to want it to succeed - so if funds don't permit please share this page with the world, his wife and the cat on the porch.

</div></div>","An entertaining giggle-tastic tome! * Brilliantly written! Humour that goes where most dare not tread, and worth every page! * A LOL on every page! * Top notch work! These were just a handful of the comments I received on my 2009 comic book ""Glory Be!"" - the refreshingly funny ""Christian satire"" book that will literally make you LOL (laugh out loud). It's biting humour aimed at everyday (and every Sunday) church folk also extends to everyday secular folk - so nobody is left out in the cold. Glory Be! crosses all boundaries and no matter what you believe, believe me - you'll chortle, guffaw or snigger. Perhaps even a combination of all three.


My StoryMy love of comics began back in the 70s. Books like Mr Men, The Munch Bunch and The Blobs all inspired me, so I doodled cartoons for much of my childhood, and at every available opportunity... which was often frowned upon in Maths lessons.Being skinny and ginger circa 1985 had me at a disadvantage, and I'd often come home from school and cry over the dog. Thankfully my fantasy land got me through. I bought comics by the dozen and found myself enchanted by this fictional wonderland. So I'd create my own characters and lead them on their own zany adventures. Perhaps my proudest moment was winning first prize for a poster I designed in Science (of all lessons). It depicted crazy characters getting up to all sorts of tomfoolery in the classroom, and my teacher thought it could run and run. That day my existence had been justified, and my destiny beckoned.Today I'm launching the second of my Glory Be! comic books. The reviews of the first book were better than I could have wished for, so writing another was never going to be easy. I'm delighted that I now have an altogether more 'focused' book than the first. In fact it metaphorically rocks. While Glory Be! is certainly not a children's comic, it's no Viz either. Much of the content is far too highbrow, sarcastic, or tongue-in-cheek for younger audiences to understand â€“ which is why it carries the ""mature readers"" tag. Besides, even if younger readers don't fully appreciate the irony, I'm sure they'll delight in perusing the pictures.Glory Be! also features the adventures of Norton Mouse, the loveable little rodent with a penchant for purple sweaters and tweeting. He's followed by a wide variety of people, including Jonathan Ross, Phillip Schofield and Lisa Faulkner (to namedrop just a few). In his eponymous(e) comic you'll also get to meet a few of his mousey pals and nephew, Nelson, as they partake in hilarious antics.So what is Glory Be?In a nutshell - it's a comic based around a dysfunctional church by the name of Riverdale. Straight away you may hear church bells and assume it's ""religious"" or ""preachy"" but it's neither. It's just a book about a modern, charismatic church community and all the characters within that community. Of course like any cartoon it's a distorted, vastly exaggerated representation of real life. So it's also really funny. We have characters like Judgemental Jonah â€“ who lunges his sword of judgement into his fellow Christians but fails to see his own short-comings, Barry Boaster - who does good deeds, only to boast about it for praise from his fellow man - and Steve O'Grady, a man who wears a sheet over his face because he's too ashamed to be seen as a Christian. Meanwhile, Pastor Peter Loftus endures lots of ""face palm"" moments as he struggles to lead his Machiavellian and troublesome flock down the narrow path.Book 2: Chariots of Ire focuses on Riverdale's preparations for the Christian Olympics, but all is not well in camp. There's bickering, in-fighting, personal pride and resentment throughout - and that's before the enemy really sticks its claws in. The enemy being the Satanist church around the corner who plot to derail the Olympics and bring about the downfall of the pesky Christians. Meanwhile Pastor Peter enlists Norton Mouse to be the Riverdale team mascot, but this brings disquiet within the ranks, mostly from Judgemental Jonah, who believes Norton is a ""demon"" from the ninth circle of hell.You can pigeon-hole Glory Be! as a ""Christian"" comic but that's not strictly true. Yes, it has an underlying Christian ethos, but it's mostly about a group of people from all walks of life (who may not even like each other) who are thrown together for a greater good. A non-believer/non-churchgoer would actually garner as much from Glory Be! as a devout Christian. In fact for some Christians, this sails far too close to the wind for their liking. This is church life - warts and all. There really isn't a comic book out there like Glory Be! We've had comics about the dysfunctional family, workplace, school, etc over the years but none (to my knowledge) that focuses on a church congregation. We've had comedies like ""The Vicar of Dibley"" and ""Rev"", but they're different animals altogether. I believe Glory Be! will open a lot of doors and change peoples perceptions of Christians and church on the whole. Everyday (mostly on Twitter) I read something aimed at Christians which is built upon sheer ignorance. Usually some cringe inducing dross they've seen on TV or a Bible scripture they've glanced at and taken out of all context. I suspect Judgemental Jonah will ruffle lots of feathers, but here's one of those characters who you laugh at and not with. I'm sure people will appreciate the irony...Glory Be! isn't going to save your soul â€“ and nor will it convert you to atheism. It's simply unconventional (and rather un-PC) entertainment that is designed to make you laugh - or at least chortle.What I Need & What You GetI'm aiming to print 2,000 copies of a 68 page ""Glory Be! Book 2"" which will include a 16 page ""Norton Mouse"" comic - in total 84 pages. This will cost just over Â£3000 alone. Your money will go directly to the printing costs of this book. Advertising and distribution could cost another Â£1,000, but I will be advertising with great care. I'll also be using my own money for printing/promotion, but if I raise MORE than I need I certainly won't waste it by adding an extra 16 pages of nonsense. Additional funds will rollover to the next book.So what happens if I don't raise my target?In this case the page count will just have to decrease, and I'll be spending sleepless nights deliberating over what pages should be left on the bedroom floor. 36 and 48 page editions are also a possibility, it's just that 68 pages have been written. Failure to reach the target may also result in the Norton Mouse comic being put on the back-burner. As Book 2: Chariots of Ire is based upon the 2012 Olympics, launching it any later than July would be akin to locking the gate once the horse has bolted. Therefore the provisional release date is July 7th 2012, when I will be appearing at the London Film and Comic Con at Olympia (which seems apt). Although I will be taking pre-orders once I know the page count.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you've read this far you obviously care enough about this project to want it to succeed - so if funds don't permit please share this page with the world, his wife and the cat on the porch. Share it with your friends, family, and those ""friends"" on Facebook you never speak to. You can even share it with your enemies.If you do have a bit of spare cash please check out the perks of donating (to your right) and choose one that works for you. Believe me, your money won't go to waste. Creating comic books is my passion, and has been for most of my life. Nobody in the world wants this to succeed more than I do. Look at me. I'm 37 years old, single and living with my parents. I've been trying to do this alone for too long and I've suffered for my art. It's cost me time, money, possibly relationships - and that's how much I love doing it, and that's why I'll still be doing it for as long as my mind and body permit. One day all the blood, sweat, tears, frustration and angst will be worth it. Thank you for your time.David C Hill",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p class=""p3""><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">Hello, my name is Lauri Ahonen. I'm an illustrator from Finland. Me and my brother Jaakko made a comic book, ""Jaybird"", that tells the story of a very small and very scared little bird, who lives alone in a great big house with his mother. He's never been outside the house, and won't, as long as his mother has a say about it. </p>

<p class=""p4"">You can read the first 60 pages of the comic here: <a href=""http://www.jaybird-comic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.jaybird-comic.com</a></p>

Hey! The remainder of the print run (a couple hundred books) is now for sale at
http://www.jaybird-comic.com The books ended up being rather big, 12 by 8.7 inches. I don't think there is a single page where I'm not happy with the print quality. The printer, Jelgavas tipogrāfija did their job really well!
Update, 02-01-2013
We've reached the goal, just hours before the deadline. Phew! Thank you everyone! You are awesome! Now, it'll take a couple of weeks to get the books to print, and then two more for printing. So everyone who ordered a book can expect theirs sometime in march. 
After the books have shipped, the comic book will be for sale on www.jaybird-comic.com
Thank you again for making this possible. 
 
Background
Hello, my name is Lauri Ahonen. I'm an illustrator from Finland. Me and my brother Jaakko made a comic book, ""Jaybird"", that tells the story of a very small and very scared little bird, who lives alone in a great big house with his mother. He's never been outside the house, and won't, as long as his mother has a say about it. 
 
 
The comic
You can read the first 60 pages of the comic here: http://www.jaybird-comic.com
What's unusual about this comic book is that it's nearly silent. There are a few lines of dialogue, but mostly the narrative relies on images. It is our first comic book, and we're pretty excited about it. 
 

 
Printing the book
We're doing this project on indiegogo to fund a print run of 1500 copies. The run will be printed and distributed in north america, and is intended for american audiences. 
The price estimate for printing is $10,500, and it's based on the average of two price quotes from separate printers. We estimate the costs for storage and distribution to be around $500. The book will be shipped directly to the Amazon Fulfillment central warehouse, and distributed from there.
 
 
Perks!
For $1, you'll get a digital wallpaper of the Bad Birds (as seen above). Any image ratio or monitor resolution will be available. 
$5 will get you the contents of the book in an easy to read .pdf file. And the digital wallpaper.
 
 
And $15 will get you 20 choice strips from an earlier comic of mine, dr. badger (sample above). These aren't and won't be made available anywhere else. Also, you'll get all of the above.
 

For $40 you will get the hardcover book (6x9 in, or possibly slightly larger). The book will have 128 full color pages and your name recognized as a backer. You'll get the other perks mentioned above, as well.

KOL sat in a file folder until 2006 when I decided to make it a storyline for “The Norm”.</span></p><p><span>Ten months and 250 strips into ""Knocked Out Loaded"", life imitated art when my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer, beginning a journey so many women and their families are familiar with. In 2009, my wife and I decided to give her a break to heal properly and I accepted a position teaching at the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD).</span></p><p><span>My wife  is now healthy and we’re back to the norm again. Ha. (see what I did there?).</span></p><p><span>I want to finish this book this year and I’ve cleared the decks to do it -- I resigned from teaching, I'm not consulting with any companies and I'll get back to writing comics -- but I need your help.</span></p><p><span>I want to raise money to fund not only the production of the ebook, but also the design and production of a limited edition print book.</span></p><p><span><em>Original pitch video is here (yes, it's still embarrassing): <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Waunv_zHYRM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Waunv_zHYRM </a></em></span></p><p> </p><h3><span>What's Cool About This Project</span></h3><p><span>First off, ""Knocked Out Loaded"" is 80% done...</span></p><p><span>In 2007 I published ""Knocked Out Loaded"" to jantze.com five days a week as a color daily comic strip; I wrote it daily with only an outline and theme in mind. In other words, I let the characters take the story where they felt it should go, knowing only where everyone needed to meet at the end of the story. Kind of like jazz or improv.</span></p><p><span>Another way to describe the process is I wrote a long-form story using short-form techniques. Each three strips make up a page in the book. And each six strips make up a layout in a book spread. In 1989 the presumptive 20-something version of me called it a comic art novel...because it was meant to be a mix of the comics and the novel forms.</span></p><p><span>“Knocked Out Loaded” is about fear. After his wife’s miscarriage, Norm doesn’t want to move forward, he’s afraid of anything new. He’s stuck in his life, his relationships, his job. So he runs away from it all for a day of skiing, where he’s knocked out loaded. Literally. Short-term memory loss. So when Norm stumbles back to his life, love and job with no strings attached, man, does it drive everyone nuts! ""Knocked Out Loaded"" is about the fear to grow up, grow strong, grow wise and, ultimately, grow old.</span></p><h3><span>What Will The Funds Be Used For?</span></h3><p><span>Here's a breakdown in more detail, the first two items will be the bulk of my expenses:</span></p><ul>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Igor Noronha and I'm a comic book artist and animator. I was born in Brazil, and I came to Denmark about two and a half years ago to study life drawing. I decided to stay here in the environment of this school and started a company, the animation and comics studio Amazu.tv (former Tlob Studios).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have started the Light Apprentice project as a graduation project back in Brazil, and I took it here with me to develop it further. Right now, you can see the first animated episode on the website, as well as read the four first chapters of the comic, all for free.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My policy is to let the content for free on the website for anyone, from anywhere, to enjoy it (I'm planning on translating the comic to Portuguese, Spanish and French in the future).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But unfortunately, to make this kind of work costs me an incredible amount of time, and I'd like to make this my main source of income, so I can release new chapters ona regular basis, like every month. And not every six months, as it has been so far.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The money will basically go to pay my bills. $500 is my rent for December, so at least I have a place to sleep, but the full cost of my monthly living (including food, materials for the comic, etc) is <strong>$2000</strong>. <u>The close to this amount I get, the more love I can put into the comic. I'm being sincere here and I'm not shy about it, as it's the only way I found to deliver the comic soon without having to worry about the financial side of my private life.</u></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the goal isn't reached on time, I'll probably have to work on someting else than the comic to pay the bills and you'll only be able to read it in March or April 2011, at least, depending on how difficult it will be to find work (this is how things are and how it's been with the other chapters, unfortunately). Even if the goal isn't reached, all the money will be used to help me pay my bills to develop the comic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you like my work and believe it can go somewhere, please support this project. I think not only you, but all the fans the comic has gathered since the first time I published it on the web in 2008 deserve a regular release of the chapters and I'm very eager to continue the story. I still have a lot to tell.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- If you donate $5 or $10, you'll have your name on the (upcoming) ""credits"" section on the website and Facebook wall.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- If you donate $30, you get the above and an issue of the first colllected volume of the comic (chapters 1 to 3) and Facebook wall.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- If you donate $50, you get an autographed comic instead (shipping included), plus your name on the website and Facebook wall.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> - If you donate $70, you get an autographed comic (shipping included), plus a sketch of any one character you like! (plus your name on the website and Facebook wall)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- If you donate $125, you can create a character (or use one of your own) that will appear on the background in chapter 5, when Nate &amp; Co. go to a carnival festival. Your character will be there forever! (plus your name on the website and Facebook wall)</p>

</div></div>","My Story
Hi, my name is Igor Noronha and I'm a comic book artist and animator. I was born in Brazil, and I came to Denmark about two and a half years ago to study life drawing. I decided to stay here in the environment of this school and started a company, the animation and comics studio Amazu.tv (former Tlob Studios).
 
I have started the Light Apprentice project as a graduation project back in Brazil, and I took it here with me to develop it further. Right now, you can see the first animated episode on the website, as well as read the four first chapters of the comic, all for free.
 
My policy is to let the content for free on the website for anyone, from anywhere, to enjoy it (I'm planning on translating the comic to Portuguese, Spanish and French in the future).
 
But unfortunately, to make this kind of work costs me an incredible amount of time, and I'd like to make this my main source of income, so I can release new chapters ona regular basis, like every month. And not every six months, as it has been so far.
 


What I Need & What You Get
The money will basically go to pay my bills. $500 is my rent for December, so at least I have a place to sleep, but the full cost of my monthly living (including food, materials for the comic, etc) is $2000. The close to this amount I get, the more love I can put into the comic. I'm being sincere here and I'm not shy about it, as it's the only way I found to deliver the comic soon without having to worry about the financial side of my private life.
 
If the goal isn't reached on time, I'll probably have to work on someting else than the comic to pay the bills and you'll only be able to read it in March or April 2011, at least, depending on how difficult it will be to find work (this is how things are and how it's been with the other chapters, unfortunately). Even if the goal isn't reached, all the money will be used to help me pay my bills to develop the comic.
 
If you like my work and believe it can go somewhere, please support this project. I think not only you, but all the fans the comic has gathered since the first time I published it on the web in 2008 deserve a regular release of the chapters and I'm very eager to continue the story. I still have a lot to tell.
 
- If you donate $5 or $10, you'll have your name on the (upcoming) ""credits"" section on the website and Facebook wall.
 
- If you donate $30, you get the above and an issue of the first colllected volume of the comic (chapters 1 to 3) and Facebook wall.
 
- If you donate $50, you get an autographed comic instead (shipping included), plus your name on the website and Facebook wall.
 
 - If you donate $70, you get an autographed comic (shipping included), plus a sketch of any one character you like! (plus your name on the website and Facebook wall)
 
- If you donate $125, you can create a character (or use one of your own) that will appear on the background in chapter 5, when Nate & Co. go to a carnival festival. Your character will be there forever! (plus your name on the website and Facebook wall)
 


Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't donate or you'd like to do even more, you can spread the word on Facebook (www.facebook.com/lightapprentice) or Twitter (if you'd like to follow me, I'm @iggynore).
And whatever else you can think of ;D

<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">A Comic, A Passion, and a Dream to Make it Happen</span></strong></p>
<p>Hello!  It’s very nice to meet you!  My name is Casey Knoll, and I’m an indie comic book creator, who’s working to try and go professional.  Ever since I could pick up a pencil, I’ve been drawing pictures and writing stories, in the hopes that someday, I could publish one of my very own. Comic books became the perfect outlet for both of my passions, and today, I’m working to make my dream come true.  I was always bullied at school, and found it hard to make friends; people thought I was weird for getting lost in my imagination. But comics, and the superheroes and adventures within them greatly comforted me, teaching me lessons of friendship and to see the good in people.  So I now hope that my own comics can help others the same way they helped me.</p>
<p>You can see my artwork portfolio here--&gt; <a href=""http://kartoon12.deviantart.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://kartoon12.deviantart.com/</a></p>
<p>And “Jamie Jupiter” is currently a webcomic here--&gt; <a href=""http://jamiejupiter.thecomicseries.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://jamiejupiter.thecomicseries.com/</a></p>
<p><em><strong>And be sure to check out the gallery HERE, for plenty of preview images and videos!</strong></em></p>
<p><img alt=""Jamie Jupiter Pin Up"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://jamiejupiter.thecomicseries.com/files/gogojj/gogojj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>So what is “<em>Jamie Jupiter</em>” about? Well, without spoiling too much, it's basically about an alien space cop disguised as a human high school student. Only two of the students know her true identity, and now the trio must defend the Earth from alien invaders.  A good portion of it was inspired by <em>Star Trek</em>, magical girl anime, and “high school drama mixed with sci-fi” series like <em>Smallville</em>. <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em> and <em>The Powerpuff Girls</em> were the two shows that inspired me to become an artist, so if any of these genres interest you, I think this book will be a nice treat.</p>
<p><em>(This comic is rated/suggested for audiences 10 years and up for mild swearing and violence.)</em></p>
<p>As of right now, I'm doing EVERYTHING. The writing, character development, drawing, coloring; it's all me. I've got five major story arcs planned for this series, and I think, no matter what, I'm going to see this story through to the very end. I'd love for it to do very well, and I'm working to get it published, in any and all forms. So every night, I pray and thank all the higher powers that be that I've gotten as far as I have, and pray to continue to help me in the future. And of course, I've got to thank all the fans, their critiques and support, and the lovely fan art I've gotten. <strong><em>A book is nothing without the fans.</em></strong></p>
<p>So really, what I’d like to achieve is to eventually have the entire series printed, and be able to sell the book at conventions.  But that’s a BIG goal. So for now, I just work on tiny goals like this.  Just being able to see the first issue at a convention table, and selling it to fans would be a dream come true.  And it can only happen with <strong><em>YOUR</em></strong> help!</p>

<p>Okay, so on to the question you’re asking: where’s the money going?</p>
<p>This campaign is to help fund the short print run of the first trade paperback of “<em>Jamie Jupiter</em>”. Contained within <em>70, full color pages,</em> are issues one and two, which serve as the two part “pilot episode” of the series.</p>
<p>I initially only had a small goal of $200, but IndieGoGo has a minimum of $500 to start a campaign, so really, if I could at least reach $200, that’d be great, and I would be forever thankful.  And every single penny goes strictly for the <em>printing</em> and <em>convention table</em> costs.  I was hoping to get at least 10 copies printed, but that might change depending on how well this campaign goes.</p>
<p>As for perks, you can see all of them listed right on the right hand side of your screen.  From sketches to wearable buttons/pins, I’ll draw/create <em>anything</em> you request of me, in the cartoony style many people have come to know me for.  And plus, what’s better than reading a good comic or book in your hands, in a comfy chair, rather than a glaring computer screen?</p>
<p>Also, thanks to critiques and suggestions from my comic’s watchers, I went back and fixed a lot of the old artwork, so the print version you’ll be seeing will have much more updated artwork compared to the original version on the website.  And when the next episodes go to print, you can have a chance to have your name included in the credits, as a big thank you for supporting me!</p>
<p>As for possible stretch goals, it’s hard to say for right now. But you can be assured that the more funds that are collected, the more bonus artwork and perks I can provide in future campaigns.</p>
<p>And even if the $500 goal isn’t reached, that’s okay. Every little bit is <em>still</em> going to help this book come to convention circuits.</p>

<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The Impact</span></strong></p>
<p>So what difference does this all make?</p>
<p>Well, this whole comic-making business has been nothing but one big learning experience, and I've met so many funny and kind people that I never would have met otherwise.  And other people have been coming to me for advice, saying they have their own stories they want to publish, and asking what should they do. I’m still very much in a beginner’s shoes, but it makes me so happy that my own dream is aspiring others to achieve theirs too.</p>
<p>I know I'm not writing Shakespeare, but I try my hardest to make a decent story with entertaining characters. If the readers come out of an episode liking/loving the characters, or learned some kind of lesson, or are just excited to want to know what happens next, then I've succeeded. More than anything, I just want the audience to get enjoyment out of reading an adventure. If I can make even one person happy, then I'm happy.</p>
<p>I think if you dig deeper, ""<em>JJ</em>"" has an underlying theme of discovering your true self, doing things you never thought you could before, and just trying to be a decent person. Pretty much all the characters have issues with either bullies, or their own self esteem, or both, but the trio of main characters eventually find companionship in one another. If there's one thing I want the readers to take away from all this, it's to <em>never</em> let bullies and mean words get to you, and to <em>never</em> give up on your dreams. If you just be a good person, and more importantly, just <strong><em>BE YOURSELF</em></strong>, you'll find people who are just like you, and are going through the same hardships as you. Don't be afraid to let the light inside you shine!</p>

<p>Hi! My name is Lauren Jordan and I love food! And illustrations! And comics! And in my experience, some of the best food is made by people who also happen to make illustrations and comics.

<p>A competition to create the funniest computer ever.  The challenge is for a robot to be funnier than the best human standup comedian in front of a live audience by 2020. We're raising prize funds for the 2013 edition of our annual computer versus computer contest with human judges, similar to the <a href=""http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/loebner-prize.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Loebner prize</a>.  The first contest was held in 2012.   More details at: <a href=""http://funniestcomputerever.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://funniestcomputerever.com</a></p>
<p>All this inspired by chats at, and trips to the pub after, the <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/London-AI-Class/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">London Stanford AI/ML class meetups</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We're hoping to make computers more fun to interact with, and have a laugh during the process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're hoping to get a small amount of funding (£500) as prize money and administration costs for the competition.  The majority of the money should go to the prize money to be awarded to the funniest computer, but we'd love to have £50 or so cover incidental costs such as domain name registration, paying grad students to help process some of the data etc.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Funders will get first access to the computer generated jokes as well as jokes created in their honour, and top funders will get the right to sit on the judges panel for the funniest computer.  And of course there's the chance to get FCE logo branded underwear!</p>

<br/>Welcome to Project Nefas. If you're looking for an exciting
 and imaginative world with unique characters and a captivating story 
then you've come to the right place! We're so thrilled to have you here 
and taking time to look over our project and certainly hope that you 
enjoy it as much as we do! <p></p>
<p>The Project
	
	Project Nefas is an undertaking to bring a new and thrilling story to 
life as well as provide an ever-changing world full of endless 
possibilities to the mind of readers everywhere. Initially starting it's
 time in the mind of it's creators as a Novel, Project Nefas evolved 
into it's current graphic format. Full of deep and complex characters, 
races, and extended lore, the world of Nefas could better be seen in 
visual form as opposed to text. This, of course, involves much more time
 and dedication as well as more hands on board thus extending a simple 
writing endeavor into a series of planning, writing, story-boarding, and
 so on. </p>
<p>	Project Nefas has been undergoing it's process of 
creation for over a decade! In this time Characters, Locations, 
Creatures, Races, Lore, and much more have been compiled and stored up 
specifically in the hopes of delivering a full and immersive world for 
readers who will eventually be exposed to it. The key goal through 
everything is to simply bring an exciting world to life for readers to 
enjoy with the highest quality available to them. We don't believe in 
taking shortcuts and only want to present this story in the highest 
quality way possible!</p>
<p></p>
<p>	The first leg of this project is to 
assemble, finalize, and complete the very first chapter of this story in
 visual format. Any additional funding (which we will talk about below) 
will be used to further following releases! <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/333601/files/20140127182303-FUNDING.JPG?1390875783"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>As with any project that has it's focus on high quality, 
funding is needed. We already have individuals set and ready to handle 
the required ends to bring this story to life including full-time 
story-boarding, visual design, writing, and so on. The only thing is to 
ensure that these talents are met with the proper funding to achieve the
 highest quality possible. Monetary gain isn't what's driving everyone, 
however, but we feel that those involved should be rightfully 
compensated for the hard work and dedication that they will be and have 
already been putting in on Project Nefas! </p>
<p>	All funding will be 
used directly for the project and in it's best interest. These funds 
cover everything from hands on board to printing and releasing! Of 
course we have special perks in place for contributors as well as 
stretch goals just in case we reach our goal and beyond. If we happen to
 move beyond our initial goal then additional funding will be put in 
play to work towards the next chapters. We want to be able to bring as 
much to the table as possible and we're asking for your help in order to
 do this! <br/></p>

<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>	Nefas is a story which takes place in an age of Iron. Divine 
laws have been shredded and the very existence of Life itself has fallen
 prey to the danger of being consumed. Earth has shifted into the 
shadows of it's darkest hours without knowing what dangers it truly 
faces. While the empires carry on, powerful figures work in the shadows,
 combating for their place upon a throne of change. The fate of the 
world is truly unknown.</p>
<p>	It all falls on the shoulders of two men.
 From very different backgrounds and very different trials, their 
burdens are strangely similar and their destinies are tightly laced 
together. One wishes to reclaim what was lost and right the wrongs which
 have led to the state of decay which threatens to crush the world. His 
actions, however, may not be the best in design and press the boundaries
 of what is right and what is wrong. The other seeks answers for his 
tortured mind as well as the justification for a great sin committed 
against him and those linked with him, urging him towards an oblivious 
urge for revenge. Little does he know that his actions will help define 
the outcome of the worlds' fate nor that deep within him lies a 
terrifying secret, locked away by unspeakable forces.</p>
<p>	The story 
follows one of these characters as he goes about his travels, 
encountering dangerous foes, forming unforgettable bonds, and struggling
 through unimaginable sacrifices. Will his actions serve to better the 
world or will they doom it and put everything that has been struggled 
for in jeopardy?  The true meaning of Life is tested and defined as 
events unfold and ageless questions are brought forth. <br/></p>

with this being the funding for the first issue, we want to see as many 
issues funded as possible. Of course we hope that the first issue will 
make the funding to move on into the second, if these issues are already

<p>We
 most certainly understand that not everyone has the availability to 
contribute money into this project. If it were that simple for everyone 
then we wouldn't need to seek the backing of supporters to get this 
project into it's finishing stages and we'd all be zooming around on 
Jet-Ski's! However, for those that would like to see this story come to 
life but can't financially back it, we simply ask that you spread the 
word. In the end word of mouth is the best method of getting a project 
known and passed around. We would like to see as many people as excited 
about this project as we are and would highly appreciate and respect any

Keychain, Be Attributed in Credits, A Large Signed Nefas Poster, Early 
Access to Future Releases, and a Personal Skype Call with the project 
team for supporting the project. 






In the event we streak right past our goal of funding the first
 issue we have a few more goals in mind that will only further the 
project and press it even deeper towards it's total completion. What 
with this being the funding for the first issue, we want to see as many 
issues funded as possible. Of course we hope that the first issue will 
make the funding to move on into the second, if these issues are already
 pre-funded then we can continue working on them as each issue is 
completed. So in other words, these are perks that will keep us hunched 
over our desks continuously. You slave drivers! 
$5000 - Nefas First Issue Funded

$10000 - Special “Book of Art” Funded
$11000 - Nefas Fourth Issue Funded

Other Ways to Help
We
 most certainly understand that not everyone has the availability to 
contribute money into this project. If it were that simple for everyone 
then we wouldn't need to seek the backing of supporters to get this 
project into it's finishing stages and we'd all be zooming around on 
Jet-Ski's! However, for those that would like to see this story come to 
life but can't financially back it, we simply ask that you spread the 
word. In the end word of mouth is the best method of getting a project 
known and passed around. We would like to see as many people as excited 
about this project as we are and would highly appreciate and respect any
 contributions in the way of spreading the word about Project Nefas!

You all have witnessed the growth of my career since 2008 (The day I logged on YouTube.). In the year of 2013 alone I released 5 Short Films.. ""Relationship Games 1-4"" (Over 6 Million Views Total) &amp; ""Adopted White Girl"" (Over 3.6 Million Views), and a debut Big Screen Movie ""THE HEAT"" w/ Sandra Bullock &amp; Melissa McCarthy. <br/><br/>As an independent guy, I've worked insanely hard to get to this point of my Career.  Hollywood and I just don't see eye to eye on my creative visions. For years, I have preached #FCHW ""Faith, Consistency, &amp; Hard Work"".. And even though people may still think I'm ""Doing It BIG"", I myself disagree. That is just the self discipline of my character. <br/><br/>Last year I felt as though I gave too much of my time to Hollywood auditioning for Movies and ended up losing the important energy to my Engine... THE PEOPLE! Even though my status has risen, I wanna break bread (make money) with my people and show the World what dynamic Independent greatness I can provide to the World as a FILM MAKER, without any Hollywood Political Restrictions being involved. You all have been begging me to do more Movie-like content. Now this is your time to help be apart of History!<br/><br/>I wanna give you all Movies from here on out! I'm tired of doing skits! I want to show the World what I can really do! And it WILL BE DONE!! #FCHW <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I'm an Entertainer, I have bills just like you.. Usually I would put out 10-20mins shorts.. Now we are talking an actual Movie so professional production is  mandatorily needed. For this Movie to be done I will need a Director, director of photography, camera operators, lighting techs, audio recorders, editors and actors.<br/></p> <ul>
<li>$15,000 will cover production (director, DP, lights, audio, editor) </li> <li>$10,000 will cover actors (More $ will go into Celebrity Appearances if $35K is Exceeded)<br/>
</li> <li>$10,000 will cover location fees, transportation, food, wardrobe, and a production assistant(s). </li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>My Goal is to give you a Movie every single year. This Generation needs strong leaders, and I feel as though we are lacking that to keep the kids positively informed. As an independent creator I have the car to evolve the culture to the next level. Now all I need is the Fuel. <br/><br/>
</div> <div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You can help in various of ways, 1 way is by donating whatever your heart desires and spread the word to a Family Member/Friend. To make this film $35,000 will be the exact cost to shoot. However, any donations exceeding the $35,000 will go towards better production of the Movie and Celebrity Appearances. The rest of the money will also go towards Meet &amp; Greets in a city near you and Premiere Events. After the video is finished I will release this on YouTube. I want to begin this shoot ASAP.. The quicker we raise money, the sooner I can start. I wanna begin this film the beginning of September 2014!<br/></p>

</div></div>","Hello! I'm Lauren Jordan, an artist from Chicago who loves food. I love cooking and baking, I love eating, and most of all I love sharing food with people I care about. In 2013, I took the plunge into self-publishing and put out a call for submissions for a zine celebrating all things food. Over thirty artists answered the call with beautiful and thoughtful recipe comics and illustrations. With funding through Indiegogo, Food Zine came to exist!
This spring, I'm thrilled to bring you Comfort Food Zine, the successor to Food Zine! Comfort Food Zine will feature even more delicious recipes and tantalizing food illustrations, with subjects ranging from cookies and grilled cheese to Chinese Hot-Pot. Contributing artists include Beatriz Bravo, Simon Brown, Kevin Budnik, Silvia Carrus, Jennifer Chan, Sophia Parsons Cope, Jenny Couture, Shannon Dybvig, Ejiwa Ebenebe, Win Evans,  Ashley ""Ash"" Fleming, Noni Garcia, Shauna J. Grant, Johanna Gustafsson, Miranda Harmon, James Howard, Sanjay Kulkaček, Elliot Lange, Véronique L., Ian Lawrence, Jade Feng Lee, Jessica Lim, Joseph Luster, Sam Dean Lynn, Rica March, Ryan McDiarmid, Christian Marie McGowan, Amanda Moody, Daksheeta Pattni, Cathy Schmeichel, Morgan Shandro, Jennifer Weber, xtina, and Jessi Zabarsky!







What We Need
All funding provided through this campaign will go towards the creation and distribution of Comfort Food Zine. Costs include ordering proofs, printing, and shipping zines to artists and backers. All contributing artists will receive a copy of the zine, but my goal is to supply the artists with multiple copies of Comfort Food Zine for them to sell or give away as they wish! The more funding we receive, the more copies I will be able to provide contributing artists!
What You'll Get
Comfort Food Zine is 92-pages of perfect-bound black-and-white food-positive comics and illustrations by thirty-five artists! That is a lot of content to consume with your eyes!

For $1 or more you'll receive our sincere thanks for helping make Comfort Food Zine a reality!
For $5 and above you'll receive a PDF version of Comfort Food Zine delivered via email!
For $15 you'll receive a physical copy of Comfort Food Zine, to be picked up at Toronto Comic Arts Festival (TCAF, May 9-10) or at Vancouver Comic Arts Festival (VanCAF, May 23-24). Please note that both of these events are free to attend, so if you live in Vancouver or Toronto, this is the tier for you!*
For $25, residents of the United States can have a physical copy of Comfort Food Zine delivered to them via USPS Priority Mail!

GALTOW is a unique world in terms of themes of loyalty and honor with physical elements and action from both the East and West. The Samurai Clan embodies honor with the sword, the Ninja Clan represents the mystery and stealth in terms of secrecy, weapons and cybernetic enhancements, the Yakuza believes in honor and strength by enforcing its laws through violence and guns, and the Sumo represents the merging of East and West through genetic manipulation of human and animal to enhance physical strength and size. All the Clans and its warriors are guided through GALTOW, a new code of ethics among warriors. </font></font></span></p><p></p><p></p>

Our Story
Xmoor Studios:
Founded in 2004 by Robert Garrett, Xmoor Studios is a publishing house specializing in comics and other diverse multimedia outlets. It all started with the creation of the comic named GALTOW created by Robert Garrett, and illustrated by Patrick David. Over the first years Robert and Patrick published several issues and also created the concept Seize Asylum of which a preview book was completed. In 2006 Patrick left Xmoor to pursue other opportunities, and was replaced by Co/publisher and Sculptor Eric Nocella who has brought his amazing style and guidance to Xmoor fulfilling our dreams with his knowledge and craft that has given an advantage to Xmoor Studios over a good deal of rival independent publishing houses in the area of merchandising and structure.
The goal to create comics was actualized following the debut of GALTOW which garnered excellent reviews and attention from major distributions such as Diamond.
Xmoor Studios is now producing and releasing innovative comic titles, merchandise, and multimedia properties, our main goal is to enter and expand into many other fields of literature and entertainment, and to impact on all these areas by creating concepts and intellectual properties.
 
 
 
  Right now, 4 issues exists and a trade paperback has been selling in limited distribution solely available when we attend conventions, but with your help, hopefully I can realize my goal of  finishing off the issues 5-6 and publishing the collected story arc as a Collected trade Edition in time for the upcoming New York Comic Con in October.
First, let me tell you a little bit about GALTOW.
GALTOW is a serial, sci-fi adventure:
Setting: 
GALTOW
Set in the year 2015, GALTOW centers upon four characters: The silent master JIYA, The massive warrior KEYLON JAKES, the flamboyant Ninja WU REYMOS, and the psychotic LADY CAFA as they fight to survive a post-apocalyptic . The main story takes place almost twenty-five years since the conclusion of The Second Vietnam War. The cities of the once proud United States are in constant turmoil, the result of conflicts fought over the years between the Great Clan Houses now acting as the ruling bodies after a disastrous civil uprising, from the ashes of the broken government Warrior Clans are now social classes, enlisting men and women who have embraced the codes of warriors from ancient Credos of the Ninja, Samurai, and Yakuza. 
Fighters from all walks of life wage violent battles in the streets hoping to gain the attention and respect of the elite fighters. Duels Known as the “GALTOWS” are fought in the great arena’s across the continent seeking the highest echelon of the martial masters… these warriors will go to any length to become a GALTOW master, including genetic enhancements, and cyborg augmentations. . For to rule the GALTOWS is to be a living god on earth.
 
 
 
 
The GALTOW property wants to be something new in a saturated market. Epic in scope, GALTOW is explosive, the ultimate intellectual property due to it’s potential to it’s ability to be developed into everything from a special FX-packed feature film, console game, TV series, action figures, a novel, and anything else that the entertainment world can dish up. 
 

 
 
 
An EPIC SCI-FI ACTION ADVENTURE SERIES BASED ON A POST APOCALYPTIC WORLD OF FOUR WARING CLANS: SAMURAI, NINJA, YAKUZA and SUMO. 
 

 
CONCEPT STYLE: GALTOW as it has been conceptualized has a wide variety of characters, with the potential for a vast universe of new characters that can be created. GALTOW is a unique world in terms of themes of loyalty and honor with physical elements and action from both the East and West. The Samurai Clan embodies honor with the sword, the Ninja Clan represents the mystery and stealth in terms of secrecy, weapons and cybernetic enhancements, the Yakuza believes in honor and strength by enforcing its laws through violence and guns, and the Sumo represents the merging of East and West through genetic manipulation of human and animal to enhance physical strength and size. All the Clans and its warriors are guided through GALTOW, a new code of ethics among warriors. 
 
 
 
This Indiegogo project was started out of my desire to raise the funds to finish the first story arc and raise the funds to print the issue into one collection.  The book will also feature bonus material, such as production sketches, layouts and an introduction by   Stunt Coordination/Actor LARNELL STOVALL Mortal Kombat: Legacy (The Viral series: fight choreographer, fight coordinator, stunt coordinator) The interiors will be in full color. Part of the Indiegogo funds will also be used to pay for the artists illustrations and to a new painted cover illustrated by a fan fave comic artist!

This is a book of pin-ups and nude artworks inspired by the women of the real world. The intent of this book is to offer a different perspective of the female form that is sorely lacking in modern pop art forms, speaking particularly to pop-art in the United States. The objective is simple and clear: let's show women, who are indeed beautiful, in every shape, form and shade that actually exists in our world. </p>
<p>One thing that makes this unique compared to another pin-up book is that it will be, in part, participant generated. Meaning, certain pledge levels have been created so that the unique perspective of this book will be generated by a woman's perspective instead of merely being my own thoughts on the subject. </p>

This is what has me more excited about the project. The audience itself will dictate what they want to see and read. </p>
<p>Initially, the project will be self-published through Kablam! If anything further happens, I will make sure to keep contributors updated. Self-publishing is an expensive ordeal. So while the profits may not be high, to break even on a project like this makes it totally worthwhile. </p>

While I'm personally OK with erotica in comics and allowing artists to draw whatever they like and not be censored by the medium or any other factor, at the same time the other side (reality) is sorely under-represented.

<p>1928, northern Greece</p>
<p>Three armed horsemen enter a village and take hostages a whole gendarmerie's station. Their goal is to secure a deal that their captain and notorious brigand, Kardaras, secretly made with the authorities, to get an amnesty for him and his two closest sidekicks, by delivering the severed head of another brigand to the state. But Kardaras had one more demand: to let him join the gendarmerie in order to exterminate the most famous and dangerous brigand of all, the legendary Pengos, that, years ago, was his closest friend and mentor.</p>

<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Our main goal is to complete our 5 issue limited series of this exciting story that's 120 pages long. To do this, we decided to produce the first issue (24 pages of pure thrill) and start a campaign for the money needed to print it. You must understand that the greek comics' scene is too small to financially sustain but a handful of indie comics (almost all greek comics are indie -or indie originated- and they are dozens of them) each year. The most local creators are romantic people that do everything for little, or no money. We want to expand our readers by this campaign. We believe that we have great stuff for you, exotic maybe, strange surely, extraordinary altogether. If we succeed with this first effort, we'll continue with the rest 4 issues. Every one of the contributors will have benefits for at least the next book. We believe in Brigands and we want you with us all the way. If we make this a classic, it will be only by your support and encouragement..!          </span></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise at least 1150$ in order to print the book, the posters, the bookmarks etc. If we get lucky, we'll save some money for the next issue, that already is in the making. We work first for our reader and then to make a decent profit. That can follow. Everyone of the backers will be mentioned inside the book and, if they contribute for the second issue, they 'll get an extra special  gift!

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We think that Brigands is an extraordinary piece of art. It speaks about a period and a place that are almost unknown, uncharted for most people in the world. Introducing these historical facts to a larger audience is for us something like a duty. We did a large research in our way to tell the story faithfully and we kind of got enthralled by the atmosphere and characters that we used as starting material to mold our own. We tried to recreate the same atmosphere for you and, we think, we managed it! Your support is crucial! It makes a dream real, it makes a dream-reality come to life, it opens new ways of storytelling by introducing a background of pure harsh nature, similar only to the barren lands of american western films. We give you that power and we dare you to use it!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have completed the first book, there is no way we get behind. We only have left some people's heads unfinished, waiting for the real heroes among you that, hopefully, will fill up the gaps! We already work for the second issue, so don't worry about the future of the strip! The Brigands are here to stay, if your support allows it, of course! Our artist is Kirby-like prolific, a real penciling -and inking, and colouring, and lettering- machine! And motivated by pure artistic instinct!

</div></div>","Short Summary


1928, northern Greece
Three armed horsemen enter a village and take hostages a whole gendarmerie's station. Their goal is to secure a deal that their captain and notorious brigand, Kardaras, secretly made with the authorities, to get an amnesty for him and his two closest sidekicks, by delivering the severed head of another brigand to the state. But Kardaras had one more demand: to let him join the gendarmerie in order to exterminate the most famous and dangerous brigand of all, the legendary Pengos, that, years ago, was his closest friend and mentor.
      
 

 

 







The Team
 
Vassilis Chilas: Writer, artist, translator, editor, publisher in the greek comics' scene since 1990.
This is the writer.


Panagiotis Tsaousis: Artist and creator of many greek indie comics in the last decade.
This is the artist.

 

Dion Tzavaras: Writer, translator, collector and comics' historian. 
This is the english language translator.

Olga Papadimitriou:  Exotic dance teacher, comics' aficionado.
This is technical advisor and project's coordinator.

Our main goal is to complete our 5 issue limited series of this exciting story that's 120 pages long. To do this, we decided to produce the first issue (24 pages of pure thrill) and start a campaign for the money needed to print it. You must understand that the greek comics' scene is too small to financially sustain but a handful of indie comics (almost all greek comics are indie -or indie originated- and they are dozens of them) each year. The most local creators are romantic people that do everything for little, or no money. We want to expand our readers by this campaign. We believe that we have great stuff for you, exotic maybe, strange surely, extraordinary altogether. If we succeed with this first effort, we'll continue with the rest 4 issues. Every one of the contributors will have benefits for at least the next book. We believe in Brigands and we want you with us all the way. If we make this a classic, it will be only by your support and encouragement..!          

What We Need & What You Get
We need to raise at least 1150$ in order to print the book, the posters, the bookmarks etc. If we get lucky, we'll save some money for the next issue, that already is in the making. We work first for our reader and then to make a decent profit. That can follow. Everyone of the backers will be mentioned inside the book and, if they contribute for the second issue, they 'll get an extra special  gift! You can even be a character in the series, starting from the first story! You can be a brigand or a gendarme (ex-brigands included) and participate in the whole series -if, of course, you choose the tough guy, that won't get shot, or stabbed, or decapitated real quick! (We can't tell the man!) All issues will be numbered and signed by the creators, the posters signed by the artist, the script by the writer. We'll make sure that every perk will come to you in perfect shape and packing, to make the unfolding a real excitement! Of course, the lucky Greek backers can have their shipping money back, if they choose to get their perks from the Phase Productions' office, here in Athens!

<h3>Hi! I'm Eliza!</h3>
<p>And I'm here to tell you that while pop stars are objectively dumb, it's OK to admit we love them. See, I believe that pop music is the greatest music of all time <i>because </i>it's dumb. I took a course in college called 'The Value of Music', so I know what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>I'm a comedy writer, musician, actor, and I'm decent at photoshop. I perform regularly at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre, NY on Maude Night and in various sketch shows. I wrote and performed<strong> my one woman show,</strong> ""Pop Stars Are Dumb (But We Love Them)"" which ran at UCB and toured Montréal and LA. </p>
<p>In the show, I do original characters that poke fun at different genres of music, as well as impressions of existing pop stars, like Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber, Kesha, and Lady Gaga. </p>
<p><strong>I wrote all of the original music</strong> for this show. Not only did I want to do awesome vocal impressions, but I wanted to take parody even further by composing music that sounds similar to each artist, roasting the music industry itself. We're really getting to the heart of what pop music <i>means</i>, guys.</p>
<p><a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/0SiniWg6idX3x98qZlsoN6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Listen to the music from 'Pop Star Are Dumb' on Spotify now!</a></p>
<p>After our successful 8 month run at UCB, we're making these songs into music videos for the world to enjoy for all eternity (after all, these sketches are <i>evergreen</i>). Plus, I look young and hot right now so I'd like to film them as soon as possible. </p>

<p>I am ARG! is a semi-autobiographical gag-a-day comic about a Toronto based animator and his bride-to-be. From Monday to Friday I am ARG entertains and delights readers online at <a href=""http://www.iamarg.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""I am ARG!"">IamARG.com</a></p>
<h3><img alt=""THE ARTIST"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://iamarg.com/images/indiegogo/THEARTIST.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p>I'm Andrew Gregoire, an Animator/Illustrator/Cartoonist based in Toronto Canada.</p>
<p>In May of 2011, I went to TCAF, The Toronto Comic Arts Festival and came out of there inspired to create my own webcomic. That night I posted the first I am ARG comic to facebook. A month later I opened a website, and after a year the comic has grown beyond anything I could have imagined. One of my initial goals was to self publish my first book.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><img alt=""The Book"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://iamarg.com/images/indiegogo/THEBOOK.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p>There's tons of extra content packed into this book. Besides the 200 strips, there's creator commentary, bonus production artwork, fanart from other webcomic artists and an exclusive set of strips written specifically for this book.</p>
<p>Here's the details at a glance!</p>
<ul>
<li>152-164 pages</li>
<li>Perfect bound color cover with B&amp;W interior pages.</li>
<li>8"" x 8"" dimensions</li>
<li>Contains the first 200 I am ARG strips </li>
<li>An all new set of strips exclusive to this book!</li>
<li>Bonus artwork and a collection fan artwork from various other webcomic artists!</li>
</ul>
<h3><img alt=""The Fundraiser"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://iamarg.com/images/indiegogo/THEFUNDRAISER.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<div>The costs involved with publishing a book are high. This fundraiser is acting as a pre-order. I'm asking for $5000 to print 1000 books. This money covers the printing costs, the shipping costs to get the books to me and to print up the various rewards. This ensures that everyone that donates $20 or more gets a book and gives me a stock that I can sell at conventions and online. There is an added cost of $8 for shipping on all pre-orders. </div>

</div></div>","UPDATE 1!
If this pre-order fundraiser reaches its target goal of $5000, everyone who contributed $20 or more(Book pre-order tier and up) will recieve a PDF copy of the book completely FREE! This offer will only be availble for this Fundraiser and only if we hit the goal. Spread the word!

I am ARG! is a semi-autobiographical gag-a-day comic about a Toronto based animator and his bride-to-be. From Monday to Friday I am ARG entertains and delights readers online at IamARG.com

I'm Andrew Gregoire, an Animator/Illustrator/Cartoonist based in Toronto Canada.
In May of 2011, I went to TCAF, The Toronto Comic Arts Festival and came out of there inspired to create my own webcomic. That night I posted the first I am ARG comic to facebook. A month later I opened a website, and after a year the comic has grown beyond anything I could have imagined. One of my initial goals was to self publish my first book.  



There's tons of extra content packed into this book. Besides the 200 strips, there's creator commentary, bonus production artwork, fanart from other webcomic artists and an exclusive set of strips written specifically for this book.
Here's the details at a glance!

152-164 pages
Perfect bound color cover with B&W interior pages.
8"" x 8"" dimensions
Contains the first 200 I am ARG strips 
An all new set of strips exclusive to this book!
Bonus artwork and a collection fan artwork from various other webcomic artists!


The costs involved with publishing a book are high. This fundraiser is acting as a pre-order. I'm asking for $5000 to print 1000 books. This money covers the printing costs, the shipping costs to get the books to me and to print up the various rewards. This ensures that everyone that donates $20 or more gets a book and gives me a stock that I can sell at conventions and online. There is an added cost of $8 for shipping on all pre-orders. 
 

Any extra funding gathered will be put right back into the comic. Whether that be hosting costs, advertising, convention appearances, new merch or anything else ARG related.
I've also got some extra surprises planned if this fundraiser reaches certain milestones.

In addition to a preorder of the book itself and your name in the back of the book as a ""Supporter of I am ARG!"", there are various incentives for helping to get this book printed!

<p><strong>TALK!</strong> is an anthology of short graphic stories with the defining premise that each story will focus solely on a conversation between two people.  It attempts to break the 'fourth wall' by directing portions of the conversation directly at the reader.  The intention is to make the reader feel like they are  eavesdropping on a conversation between characters they are seated beside. <strong>TALK!</strong> is the product of eight months of toiling away in a basement and countless cups of coffee.  I am extremely proud of this book and excited for you to read it!</p>
<p><strong>TALK!</strong> will be printed as a <strong>52-page hard-cover</strong>.  Every copy of <strong>TALK!</strong> purchased through Indiegogo will come signed and numbered.  I have sourced an excellent printer and have personally inspected the quality of their books.  The above image is a 'mock-up' of the finished product.</p>

<p><span>I've always been an avid comic book fan but as I grow older and more decrepit, I've tended towards non-hero style comics.  I have always found that creating a story through the non-verbal elements of a conversation to be just as critical as the dialogue itself.  TALK! attempts to highlight the changing facial expressions and body language to convey the conversation visually as much as through the text.</span></p>
<p><span>The idea of a comic entirely of conversation appealed to me and I believe well suits my artistic style. </span></p>

</div>
<h3>Welcome to LadyStar!</h3>
<p>Hello, folks! Cat here. I'm the scriptwriter for the LadyStar comic series.  On behalf of my team:  Bug, Cube, Gammyun, Kez, Mayshing, Emily, Anna and Animetor, I'd like to introduce you to a project that we've all had quite a bit of fun putting together. </p>
<p><img alt=""Cat"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://heavycatweb.net/resource/cat.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Cat""/></p>
<h3>Short History of the Project</h3>
<p>LadyStar has been in development since 1999. We've made games, novels, iPad apps and manga. But of all the projects we've ever done, the comics we started drawing in 2008 were the ones that people really enjoyed the most.</p>
<h3>Our Plan</h3>
<p>We need your help to update our comic series for mobile devices.  We're going all-out to make LadyStar one of the best digital comics available!</p>
<p>We really want you to be able to take our stories with you on your favorite mobile platform and share them with your friends.  If you've been looking for a story where the girls get a chance to fight evil, believe me.  You've found it!</p>
<p>We need to rework our pages and artwork to fit an e-book format, and we need to write a new introduction and story for the mini-artbook and the new e-book format special edition.  We have a team of 12 artists ready to help with this important work, and your contribution will help us cover the costs of their time if we need it.</p>
<h3>How you Can Help</h3>
<p>If you make any contribution, you will get a copy of either the Kindle version or a DRM-free PDF of the new LadyStar: Jessica Hoshi and the Ajan Warriors Comic #1 Special Edition.  If you make the higher level contribution, you will also get a free copy of LadyStar: Fury of the Venom Legion Comic #1 in your choice of the same formats.</p>
<h3>What you Get</h3>
<p>That's <strong>two</strong> complete color comics <strong>and</strong> a mini-artbook <strong>and</strong> a preview of LadyStar: Jessica Hoshi and the Ajan Warriors Comic Issue #2 for $5.00!  If you want a lot for your contribution, you found the right campaign! </p>
<h3>But I Don't Have a Kindle!</h3>
<p>That's okay! There is <strong>free</strong> Kindle software for iPad, iPhone, Android Phones and Tablets, Blackberry, Mac and PC! You can read the Kindle editions of our comics on almost any platform!</p>
<h3>Everyone Can Join In!</h3>
<p>Our studio team spent nearly two years writing, illustrating, inking, coloring and shading these pages.  We're very happy with our work and we can't wait to share it with you and all of our new readers. LadyStar is a story about friendship and courage with lots of action and adventure, and I think Jessica Hoshi and her adventures will inspire many new readers.</p>
<p>Be sure to check back, because if this campaign is a success, you won't believe what we've got in store for you next!</p>
<p>Please share our campaign with everyone you know, and be sure to visit us on Twitter and Facebook and help us spread the word.  Prepare to do battle, LadyStar fans!</p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">SIREN'S CALLING: A HORROR NOIR is a creator-owned graphic novel by John T.

</div><div>Lorie’s biggest obstacle won’t be landing
auditions and securing roles, but keeping a firm hold over her natural craving for human flesh and

<p>For Lauren and I, SIREN'S CALLING: A HORROR NOIR marks our first attempt at a graphic novel. It's been nearly a four-year process to get us from script and sketches to the final lettered product, and we can't wait to share with all of you.</p>
<p>Originally, we were going to sell issue #1 digitally through <a href=""https://www.comixology.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ComiXology</a> and in PDF form; but the more we looked at our finished product, the more we wanted to hold a copy of it in print, a format Lauren and I both prefer. I still visit Midtown Comics every Wednesday to pick up my stash. <br/><br/>So we figured that if we wanted to hold a copy in our hands, maybe some of you would, too.</p>
<p><br/></p>

</p>
<p>With your support, Lauren and I looking to produce a small high-quality print run of 500 copies of SIREN'S CALLING: A HORROR NOIR #1, if we can hit our goal of $2,000.</p>
<p>Why are we coming to <i>you</i>, our readers, to
make this print run a reality? We want to make sure there's an audience for our horror noir <i>before</i> we print them, so we're setting the price lower than most crowdfunding campaigns for print comics because we want to pre-sell it to as many of you who want it as possible.</p>
<p><b>Hemlock Printers USA</b><br/>Now, just because the price is lower doesn't mean the quality will be less than standard. On the contrary, it'll be more. We will not be using the traditional printers most indie comic creators use. Instead, we've chosen to team up with <a href=""http://www.hemlock.com/#!/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hemlock Printers USA</a>, which uses the highest quality recycled paper and prints a plethora of the most popular print magazines in the world like <i>Collective Quarterly</i>, <i>Chick Pea</i>, and <i>Cherry Bombe</i>, as well as my fiancée’s magazine <i>Eighty</i>. </p>
<p>And they’re just truly awesome to work with. (Here’s looking at you, Brad and Frits!)</p>
<p>Here's the breakdown of what we need help with, funding-wise: <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">         </span></p>

<br/> <p>There's a much larger plan in the works here. This isn't just about making a print edition of SIREN'S CALLING: A HORROR NOIR #1 a reality. Here's the deal: <br/><br/>With your help, we'll get a print edition up and running. And with your help, we'll get a bunch of people to download the full first issue on Halloween (Saturday, 10/31). Then, I'll take take our print issue, data on both the digital (via ComiXology) and print (Indiegogo) sales and package those together with a proposal and pitch SIREN'S CALLING: A HORROR NOIR to the big three indie comic publishers: <a href=""https://imagecomics.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Image Comics</a>, <a href=""http://www.darkhorse.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dark Horse Comics</a>, and <a href=""http://www.boom-studios.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Boom! Studios</a>/<a href=""http://www.archaia.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Archaia Entertainment</a>.<br/><br/>The goal here is to get one of these three publishers, of which I have contacts at two of the three, to help us bring to you, our readers and faithful supporters, issues #2 - #6 of the first complete story arc and bring it to an even wider audience. That's been the plan for almost four years now. We just needed the product. </p>

From today (10/13/2015) until Saturday, 10/17/2015, we're looking for strong sirens to sing the praises of SIREN'S CALLING: A HORROR NOIR and help us get to our stretch goal of $4,000 by luring (or referring) their friends and getting them to give a little bit of themselves to our Indiegogo. Here's how it works:
Again, you MUST be signed into your Indiegogo account and you MUST use the share tools from a desk- or laptop computer (not from a smart phone or tablet) in order to participate in this referral contest. Then, check back daily to see the most current numbers on the leaderboard below:

[Above (FINAL) list updated 10/18/2015 at 12:35 PM EDT.]So start singing all you social sirens, so you can earn some more perks, and thanks in advance for spreading our song further out into the seas of success!
THURSDAY, 10/08/2015:
NEW PERK (And this time, it's personal!):
Okay, so admittedly it is a bit morbid, but hey, that's how the sirens of yore got personal with their victi–– er, backers: They would lure strong sailors passing by in their ships onto the jagged rocks of their island home, and the outcome was always the same. And this new perk includes a copy of SIREN'S CALLING: A HORROR NOIR #1, too. (In case you didn't get one yet, or you want to gift one to a friend.)FRIDAY, 10/02/2015:
Thanks to all of YOU, we have hit our goal of $2,000 in only two days! As a special thank you, we are unveiling this brand new, severely limited edition perk:




There are only five of these being offered by Halftone Crew, are available in women's and men's sizes, and come in beautiful noir! Pick yours up before they're gone!

  
SIREN'S CALLING: A HORROR NOIR is a creator-owned graphic novel by John T. Trigonis & Lauren Clemente that spins a sordid story of Lorie Lye, a mythical siren from the sea who, fed up with her man-eating ways, chooses to leave it all behind her for a shot at the glitz and glamour of starlet life in Hollywood, California, 1947. 
Lorie’s biggest obstacle won’t be landing
auditions and securing roles, but keeping a firm hold over her natural craving for human flesh and
blood, because lurking beneath her alluring physique lies an ancient creature
too terrible for even the lights and cameras of Tinseltown to capture. SIREN'S CALLING is a horror comic that blends nuances of film noir into a deeper tale told of a young woman who must find the strength to fit into an all-too-human world while fighting off the urges of the demonic femme fatale within her.

For Lauren and I, SIREN'S CALLING: A HORROR NOIR marks our first attempt at a graphic novel. It's been nearly a four-year process to get us from script and sketches to the final lettered product, and we can't wait to share with all of you.
Originally, we were going to sell issue #1 digitally through ComiXology and in PDF form; but the more we looked at our finished product, the more we wanted to hold a copy of it in print, a format Lauren and I both prefer. I still visit Midtown Comics every Wednesday to pick up my stash. So we figured that if we wanted to hold a copy in our hands, maybe some of you would, too.



 

With your support, Lauren and I looking to produce a small high-quality print run of 500 copies of SIREN'S CALLING: A HORROR NOIR #1, if we can hit our goal of $2,000.
Why are we coming to you, our readers, to
make this print run a reality? We want to make sure there's an audience for our horror noir before we print them, so we're setting the price lower than most crowdfunding campaigns for print comics because we want to pre-sell it to as many of you who want it as possible.
Hemlock Printers USANow, just because the price is lower doesn't mean the quality will be less than standard. On the contrary, it'll be more. We will not be using the traditional printers most indie comic creators use. Instead, we've chosen to team up with Hemlock Printers USA, which uses the highest quality recycled paper and prints a plethora of the most popular print magazines in the world like Collective Quarterly, Chick Pea, and Cherry Bombe, as well as my fiancée’s magazine Eighty. 
And they’re just truly awesome to work with. (Here’s looking at you, Brad and Frits!)
Here's the breakdown of what we need help with, funding-wise:          


    




 There's a much larger plan in the works here. This isn't just about making a print edition of SIREN'S CALLING: A HORROR NOIR #1 a reality. Here's the deal: With your help, we'll get a print edition up and running. And with your help, we'll get a bunch of people to download the full first issue on Halloween (Saturday, 10/31). Then, I'll take take our print issue, data on both the digital (via ComiXology) and print (Indiegogo) sales and package those together with a proposal and pitch SIREN'S CALLING: A HORROR NOIR to the big three indie comic publishers: Image Comics, Dark Horse Comics, and Boom! Studios/Archaia Entertainment.The goal here is to get one of these three publishers, of which I have contacts at two of the three, to help us bring to you, our readers and faithful supporters, issues #2 - #6 of the first complete story arc and bring it to an even wider audience. That's been the plan for almost four years now. We just needed the product. 

    
 

John T. Trigonis makes
stories (poems, novels, and films) when not mentoring others on how to fund the
making of their own cinematic tales. He is the co-creator and writer of Siren’s Calling: A Horror Noir, a
nostalgist, noirchitect, and TEDx talker. He was raised right on coffee,
comics, and red wine, as well as having literally
written (and re-written) the book on Crowdfunding for Filmmakers. 
Lauren Clemente is an Art Director and Illustrator based in New York City. She has experience in editorial publishing, marketing, and is the illustrator and co-creator of Siren’s Calling: A Horror Noir. With a retro spirit, you'll find her sipping coffee or cocktails, taking photos with her iPhone, geeking out about Harry Potter, planning her next travel adventure, breaking bread with good friends, and doting over animals (especially dogs!).



If you love not only the look but the feel of comic book pages between your
fingers while you read them; if you love print anything; if you want to immerse yourself in a horror story that transcends the boundaries of the genre itself and tells a more profound story, then Lauren and I
invite you to heed the call of our Lorelei and pick up a print copy of a signed SIREN'S CALLING: A HORROR NOIR #1 for just $15. 
Not sure? DOWNLOAD THE FREE SIX-PAGE PREVIEW HERE and we're sure Lorie  will lure you deeper into her stark world.And take a look at some of the other perks on offer, from postcards and exclusive prints to being drawn onto our back cover with Lorie, and even being drawn into
issue #2 as a background, cameo, or main character! 
This is a grassroots effort on all our parts, so I only
ask one other thing after you pre-purchase issue #1 at whatever level suits you best:
share this Indiegogo with anyone you know who loves a good graphic novel, and
let’s get #SirensCalling printed and pushed out to the world!
Thanks so much, everyone!



Q: Most of the perks say they'll be delivered by November? What if November comes and goes and I still don't get my perks?

A: That won't happen, because if for whatever reason we run behind with our perk fulfillment, you can rest assured you'll know long before the end of November.Q: The ""Extended Plan"" sounds swell, Trig, but... what if you get rejected  from all three of those publishers? Is SIREN'S dead in the water?
A: Absolutely not! There are lots of other publishers out there (Top Shelf, Titan Comics, Alterna, Black Mask, and Zenoscope, just to name a few), and if we meet with rejection from my top three choices, then we'll keep pitching to anyone who accepts submissions. I'm just a believer that you start from the top and work your way from there (hey, it's worked out well for me so far!) 
Q: Why are Image Comics, Dark Horse Comics, and Boom! Studios/Archaia Entertainment your top three?

A: 'Cause hand down, they're publishing the best creator-owned comic books on the market today.Q: Why isn't DC and Marvel on the list?
A: They're not comic publishers anymore; they're movie studios.Q: Back to crowdfunding: What if you don't hit your $2,000 goal?
A: We're still gonna make this print run happen somehow. We're running a flexible fundraising campaign here on Indiegogo, and that means we keep what we raise. So one way or another, we're gonna owe some hardcore fans a print copy, and one way or another, we'll deliver.Q: What if you go above your goal? Like, way above your goal?
A: We have a plan for that, which if we're fortunate enough go far enough beyond our initial goal of $2,000, and we'll talk about that if and when we get there. I promise.",34.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<p><strong>Sophie goes on tour!</strong></p>
<p>Hello Everyone! My name is Sophie Labelle, the French-Canadian artist behind Assigned Male, a webcomic about a bunch of sarcastic trans and queer teenagers that has been running since 2014. I've also been giving talks and doing events all over the place in the past few years! In 2020, it's reaching new heights with my first actual World Tour, for which I've been receiving invitations on every continent of the world.</p>
<p>As a trans woman, I feel very privileged to be able to do this. In the past, every speaking tour I did allowed me to meet members from trans, queer and feminist communities of so many various backgrounds that every time, I've been learning and growing so much from these encounters.  And this time, I'd like to share that experience with everyone!</p>
<p>That's why I'll be consigning stories from my world tour into illustrated letters, which I'll send you, the backers, by physical mail or email. Then, at the end of the tour, I will turn these letters into chapters of a tour book, with more drawings!</p>
<p><strong>How will it work?</strong></p>
<p>Obviously, the funds raised will mainly go toward the printing of the book, which is estimated to be about 200 pages at the end. I have self-published more than a dozen books already, and estimate the costs to be around 10ca$/unit. I'd like to print at least 1000 of them, so that's why 10,000ca$ (7,500us$) is the minimum.</p>
<p>The rest of the funds will help fund the tour itself, since many trans organisations who will be hosting me don't have the means to pay for the traveling part. I am doing all this by myself, with no agent, and working closely with each organisation that invite me.</p>
<p>You will receive 12 letters/emails from February to June, each corresponding to a country or region I'll be visiting during the tour. These different parts are each described in the Chapters section!</p>
<p>If we reach the second goal, which will be announced in an update once and if the first goal is reached, everyone who signed up for a book will get it hardcover!</p>
<p><strong>So is it like a travel guide?</strong></p>
<p>My goal with this project is to share the stories I'm collecting from my point of view as a traveling trans artist.</p>
<p>When I was a teenager, the idea of traveling while trans seemed to be a risky one, and the risk is real. Violence exists everywhere, but so do we. </p>
<p>This project isn't a travel log, and even less some ethno-sociological study. It's an art project, which will revolve around encounters and anecdotes, and will remain entirely subjective to my own experiences, perceptions and emotions. </p>
<p>It will also be limited by which organizations invited me for this tour, which, sadly, need an internet connection, access to specific social media in order to be familiar with my work online, and to be located in a country without laws that forbid their existence.</p>
<p>This tour doesn't include any country of the Americas, which I will tour later in the coming year. If this campaign is successful, I'll consider making a similar project then!</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Pledging isn't the only way to help! Sharing the campaign on social media goes a long way. You can also show up at the events - most of them will be pinned on my Facebook page, at <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/assignedmale"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/assignedmale</a> .</p>

<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: helvetica; font-size: medium;"">The (very pleasant) surprise came when we realised just how much talent was sitting around the table at our monthly ACT (Australian Capital Territory) Comic meetups. </span></p>

<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: helvetica; font-size: medium;"">We all have individual projects and commitments, so the decision to produce a high-quality, finished, long-lasting product was unanimous. An anthology made the most sense - and it gave us an excellent excuse to collaborate with each other! </span></p>

<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: helvetica; font-size: medium;"">Once we'd decided on a full-colour anthology, we realised that for most of us, being in the ACT was an accident of employment, or education, or (in some cases) romance. Australia is a big place, and where most of us had come from, we would never have met each other. So, rather than being exclusive about it, we opened up a call for submissions artists and writers and comic creators around the country.</span></p>

There are some talented people out there - we all know it.
The (very pleasant) surprise came when we realised just how much talent was sitting around the table at our monthly ACT (Australian Capital Territory) Comic meetups. 
 
The decision to collaborate on a project was easy. 
We all have individual projects and commitments, so the decision to produce a high-quality, finished, long-lasting product was unanimous. An anthology made the most sense - and it gave us an excellent excuse to collaborate with each other! 
 
Once we'd decided on a full-colour anthology, we realised that for most of us, being in the ACT was an accident of employment, or education, or (in some cases) romance. Australia is a big place, and where most of us had come from, we would never have met each other. So, rather than being exclusive about it, we opened up a call for submissions artists and writers and comic creators around the country.
And I'm so glad we did! 
 
As at today, anthology will feature contributions by authors and artists including (but not limited to, and in no particular order):


Ryan K. Lindsay


Shane W. Smith


Ele Jenkins



Tom Dullemond


Ben Rosenthal 


Eleri Harris


Sam Cavanagh


Katie Ryan


Nate Soehardi


Alisha Howard

(A word of warning: while the Anthology will be PG-rated, some of these links contain words and images that are more suitable for more mature audiences!)
 
The Book Itself
The anthology will be 

Sized to fit into a handbag/satchel/suit pocket (A5 sized).
One hundred glossy pages.
Full colour.
A collection of stories about beginnings.
In a variety of genres - action, romance, autobiographical, super-hero, mythological.
Family friendly (though not specifically aimed at children or young adult).
 
The book will be printed locally, minimising the environmental impact and helping the local economy. 
 

What We Need (and why) & What You Get
Your contribution is helping to tell stories to the world.
 
We will be doing a small print run and making each book as beautiful as we can - rather than doing a larger print run and compromising on quality or features.
 
In addition to awesome wearable art (badges!) and electronic and physical art (avatars! prints! sketches!), we have received some exceedingly generous donations for perks. Currently available is a piece of original artby Steven Sanders, from the 'Five Fists of Science' original graphic novel!
 
(Claimed perks are listed below.)
 
All our perks will be sent as soon as available - badges, electronic art, and professional development perks will be available immediately; pre-ordered books will be filled as soon as the printing (and hand numbering) is complete!
 
No matter the size of the contribution, if you send us your twitter details, we will give you a shout out, and if you send us your URL, we will put you up on our blog as a supporter and link to your site.

Contingencies
If we reach our goal of $2000, our books will come out in March 2012. We will have a book launch and exhibition of original art from the anthology in Canberra, and we will have a table at Sydney and/or Melbourne Supanova Expo.
 
If we exceed our funding goal, we will consider a larger print run based on pre-orders. We will have a book launch and exhibition in Canberra; and we will attend more conventions across Australia.
 
If we do not reach our goal of $2000 through crowdsourced funding, we will still fill our pre-orders and provide all perks, and use online marketing and print-on-demand to get this book out to the world. We will aim to meet our deadline of March 2012
 

Other Ways You Can Help
Y'see, we Australians are shy types, not given to boasting, and reticent to put ourselves forth. We prefer to let other people do our boasting for us.

<div>Welcome to ""The Super Improbability of Marcus Egan's Heartbreak"".<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>What happens when your ex meets your one night stand? Or when you find out that they also have a past together? And what if they were once sworn enemies in the current world of Superheroes and Super-villains? Yeah, it's awkward. <br/><br/><p></p>

<div>Meet Marcus Egan. He's the average American 20-something gay man. He works as a reporter for one of Boston's top online zines, and hasn't had much luck in the love department since his ""Big Ex"" Jason kicked him to the curb and moved away without warning. But after some encouragement from his dodgeball teammates, he decides to put himself out there once again and ends up having his first one night stand.  There's only one problem; the guy he meets, Calvin, is the newest Superhero protecting the streets of Boston, and to make matters worse, he has a history with Marcus' ""Big Ex"" who's just moved back to town. Both in a romantic sense AND a super-villain sense. Now Marcus must decide if he should embrace an uncertain future with Calvin, aka The Knight Sky, or if he's willing to forget the past and rekindle his relationship with Jason, aka Doom's Day. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436045989/hvfzapvgkvbvsdagdnka.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</div>
<div>I've been reading comic books for as long as I can remember. I used to have my sisters take me to the 7-Eleven around the block from my Grandmother's house in Brooklyn so I could buy the latest issue of the ""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch"" comic. Since then I've graduated to the X-Men, Avengers, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and practically every other world saving, super-powered being you could think of in the current comic universe. I've also always had a special place in my heart for silly cartoons about people with everyday, mundane problems like dating, self confidence, and friendship. My ideal comic could be described as something that combined my two favorite genres into one mega-comic that I could obsess over.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Then, Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little Life came along, and my world was forever changed. Where else could you find a story about an up-incoming indie band, video game boss battles, and the desire to escape your past heartbreaks in the hopes of becoming a better person? After reading all six volumes, I knew this was the type of comic I wanted to create. Imagine if HBO's ""Looking"" and the Scott Pilgrim series had a baby, and that love-child went to write one of the greatest contemporary love stories the independent comic book world has ever seen (Okay, I may be exaggerating a bit). Marcus Egan's Heartbreak is just the first part of an even bigger story that's about to unfold, but it all starts here, <b><i>and we need your help!!!</i></b>

<p>In order for this graphic novel to be a success, we'll need a few things. The money raised here will go towards artists fees, printing costs, promotion materials, and eventually, shipping the finished products. <br/><br/></p>
<p>Whether you donate $1 or $100, we will have unique perks for everybody who contributes. Most donation perks include a digital copy of our story's first ""Chapter"" before any physical copies are sent out, and other perks will vary from a signed copy of the completed graphic novel itself to even being able to name a character in our book or make an appearance yourself!<br/><br/></p>
<p>Even if we don't meet our goal, we still want to make this the best possible story it can be. Granted, it may take a little longer than anticipated if we don't meet the initial goal, so the sooner we get enough funding, the faster we can get a finished product out into the world!  <br/><br/></p>

<p>The world of comic books and superheroes is rapidly expanding, and with that comes incredible change. During the Golden Age of comics, characters like Marcus Egan, The Knight Sky, or even his dodgeball teammates, The New Dodgevengers, would never have gotten stories of their own. Over the past decade though, great strides have been made in the LGBT+ community, and I've always wanted to see a story like this brought to life, with a diverse cast of characters from all different walks of life. I want readers to not only see themselves in these characters, but their friends and family members as well.<br/><br/></p>
<p></p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435870241/jzmecpk5qyr8a50y0nvt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/>Representation is important, and that's one of my main goals with Marcus Egan's Heartbreak. Along with the over-arching love story in this graphic novel, I also want to build a story around the ever-changing landscape of LGBT+ visibility in modern media, especially for a younger audience. I've seen countless comics surrounding the love lives of queer men and women, but they're always so overly sexualized and not enough emphasis is placed on the reality of these characters.

</div></div>","Welcome to ""The Super Improbability of Marcus Egan's Heartbreak"".

What happens when your ex meets your one night stand? Or when you find out that they also have a past together? And what if they were once sworn enemies in the current world of Superheroes and Super-villains? Yeah, it's awkward. 



Meet Marcus Egan. He's the average American 20-something gay man. He works as a reporter for one of Boston's top online zines, and hasn't had much luck in the love department since his ""Big Ex"" Jason kicked him to the curb and moved away without warning. But after some encouragement from his dodgeball teammates, he decides to put himself out there once again and ends up having his first one night stand.  There's only one problem; the guy he meets, Calvin, is the newest Superhero protecting the streets of Boston, and to make matters worse, he has a history with Marcus' ""Big Ex"" who's just moved back to town. Both in a romantic sense AND a super-villain sense. Now Marcus must decide if he should embrace an uncertain future with Calvin, aka The Knight Sky, or if he's willing to forget the past and rekindle his relationship with Jason, aka Doom's Day. 


I've been reading comic books for as long as I can remember. I used to have my sisters take me to the 7-Eleven around the block from my Grandmother's house in Brooklyn so I could buy the latest issue of the ""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch"" comic. Since then I've graduated to the X-Men, Avengers, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and practically every other world saving, super-powered being you could think of in the current comic universe. I've also always had a special place in my heart for silly cartoons about people with everyday, mundane problems like dating, self confidence, and friendship. My ideal comic could be described as something that combined my two favorite genres into one mega-comic that I could obsess over.

Then, Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little Life came along, and my world was forever changed. Where else could you find a story about an up-incoming indie band, video game boss battles, and the desire to escape your past heartbreaks in the hopes of becoming a better person? After reading all six volumes, I knew this was the type of comic I wanted to create. Imagine if HBO's ""Looking"" and the Scott Pilgrim series had a baby, and that love-child went to write one of the greatest contemporary love stories the independent comic book world has ever seen (Okay, I may be exaggerating a bit). Marcus Egan's Heartbreak is just the first part of an even bigger story that's about to unfold, but it all starts here, and we need your help!!!
    



In order for this graphic novel to be a success, we'll need a few things. The money raised here will go towards artists fees, printing costs, promotion materials, and eventually, shipping the finished products. 
Whether you donate $1 or $100, we will have unique perks for everybody who contributes. Most donation perks include a digital copy of our story's first ""Chapter"" before any physical copies are sent out, and other perks will vary from a signed copy of the completed graphic novel itself to even being able to name a character in our book or make an appearance yourself!
Even if we don't meet our goal, we still want to make this the best possible story it can be. Granted, it may take a little longer than anticipated if we don't meet the initial goal, so the sooner we get enough funding, the faster we can get a finished product out into the world!  


The world of comic books and superheroes is rapidly expanding, and with that comes incredible change. During the Golden Age of comics, characters like Marcus Egan, The Knight Sky, or even his dodgeball teammates, The New Dodgevengers, would never have gotten stories of their own. Over the past decade though, great strides have been made in the LGBT+ community, and I've always wanted to see a story like this brought to life, with a diverse cast of characters from all different walks of life. I want readers to not only see themselves in these characters, but their friends and family members as well.



Representation is important, and that's one of my main goals with Marcus Egan's Heartbreak. Along with the over-arching love story in this graphic novel, I also want to build a story around the ever-changing landscape of LGBT+ visibility in modern media, especially for a younger audience. I've seen countless comics surrounding the love lives of queer men and women, but they're always so overly sexualized and not enough emphasis is placed on the reality of these characters. You don't need a six pack and bulging biceps to fall in love, and you definitely don't need to show gratuitous crotch shots in ever issue. I want this story to appeal to younger audiences as well as an older demographic, and not many teenagers will be able to buy this graphic novel if they'd feel too embarrassed of their parents finding an NC-17 rated book underneath their mattresses. Marcus Egan's story is a love story, but it's also about the everyday trials one has to face then transitioning from your early-twenties into adulthood(ish).

I'm sure you know somebody who would absolutely love this story. The more eyeballs we can get on this project and the more people donate, the better the finished product will be.

CBS Broadcasts Orson Wells' The War of the Worlds. A small Washington town reacts poorly.</p></strong><p><br/><br/>Did you like the video?  Well, then you are going to LOVE the comic book.<br/><br/><strong>Concrete Martians</strong> written by Mitch Cook, illustrated by Keith Grachow - October 30th 1938, Orson Wells produces a radio show for Halloween. The Mercury Theatre Presents, H.G. Wells The War of the Worlds.<br/>The tiny lumber/concrete town of Concrete, Washington, becomes the epicenter of Martian Invasion Hysteria when, at just the point when the Martians in the radio play attack, the power goes out and so do the phones.<br/>The power that radio displayed in those early days of mass media showed us that, even without meaning to, the theatre of the mind can and often does wreak havoc amongst the masses. Local sheriff Ted ""Teddy"" Wilson has his hands full when a radio play combined with a powerful electrical storm stirs up Martian invasion fever amongst the residents of Concrete, Washington.  As the rains progress an overburdened power substation decides to quit. Of course this only fuels the hysteria and ""proves"" that the Martians are indeed invading with cruel intent.<br/>In the end, the story is revealed to be merely a radio theatre play .</p></span><p></p></span><p></p></span><p></p></span><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span>Most, if not all of the town’s people felt understandably embarrassed and went on to live their lives. However what happened on that day was never fully documented, and that's where our story takes us. </span></span></span></span></span>This story is to be presented in two installments (52 pages total) but can be combined into one graphic novel. It isn't a terribly long story as the events take place in a matter of hours and just one stormy night.<br/>Interspersed within the narrative is a retelling of the Mercury Theatre’s War of the Worlds broadcast. Up until the power goes out anyway.<br/>The events depicted are based on anecdotal evidence by people who experienced them. Newspaper reports from Concrete, Washington have aided in telling this story.　 Many such events occurred across the country that night.　<br/><br/><strong>Goals, Stretch Goals, and Rewards</strong><br/>We need to raise a minimum of $2500 to produce the first issue, 22 pages of limited color digital art. With this amount we will be able to create a digital copy that we can send out to all of our donors as well as apply to digital web comic sites like Comixology.<br/>Each page costs $200 to produce, so, for every $200 contributed, we add another page. It would be nice to provide full color, or even a full 52 page graphic novel. So we are relying on you.  Every little bit helps. We are limiting the type of rewards offered for donations because the costs associated with fulfilling the rewards, producing, shipping, etc, defeats the purpose of the donations. <br/><br/>We do have stretch goals if we get over the $2500. Really this is just the start. <br/><br/>$3500- If we reach $3500 we will include actual printed copies of the completed book at specific donation levels. Reaching more donations means completing more of the book.  <br/><br/><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Beyond $3500-</span></span></span></span> So a 52 page complete story in limited color, printed and shipped will cost a much larger amount. So anything beyond $3500 would be a great help!<br/><br/>We have received a generous gift already and that has allowed us to get started on this project and keep the remaining costs down.  That is why our asking price isn't HUGE!<br/>(Shipping copies is $6 US and Canadian addresses and $20 International.  FYI) <br/><br/></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>Who are we?<br/><strong>Mitch R Cook</strong><br/>Writer – Bio</p>
<p>I am so glad that evidence of my past comic book experience is buried in a municipal waste site somewhere in Washington State. It would be embarrassing indeed to have that cassette tape of me reading an old Fantastic Four book out loud come to attention. 　(Yes, I read it out loud to a cassette tape recorder. Yes, I did all the voices; ALL the voices. Nope, not proud of that achievement. It was a good book though.)</p>
<p>Flash forward 30 years. (Yeah, it took 30 years to get to this point)　With a public school education, Community College radio shifts, The Edward R Murrow School at Washington State University, a marriage, a graduate degree, a divorce, another marriage, a TV job in Seattle. . . all a part of my history. Now, finally, I return to writing. I just never thought it would be a comic book.</p>
<p>The comic book format has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. My brain has clearly been influenced by the pace of that form of storytelling. I never can tell a story to a group of people quickly.</p>
<p>I have been working on and off as a Broadcaster since 1991 as a student employee at KWSU and Prime Sports.  I had been the Production director(s) for Green River Community College’s Newspaper AND KGRG simultaneously.  I even spent a year in Yuma, Arizona as a Creative Services Producer/Director.  In 2006 I got back into Radio at CBS Radio Seattle in Promotions.  Yeah, I was the old man of the crew, but I enjoyed the work.  Then KOMO Called and the rest is history.  It was with Fisher that I discover the story of how the WOTW Broadcast effected the tiny town of Concrete Washington.  I HAD to tell their story.</p>
<p><br/><br/><b>Keith Grachow</b>　<br/>Illustrator -　Bio<br/>Growing up with art through his father's advertising agency, led to a BFA with a focus in graphic design. He's worked as an artist doing concept designs for a dance club to being the in-house artist for Play Along Toys. They are the toy company that made the Britney Spears' dolls and produced licensed toys such as Care Bears. He's also worked on two Disney movies through the animation company Yowza, digitally inking and painting on the traditionally animated films ""The Princess and the Frog"" and ""Winnie the Pooh"".

</span></div>","October 30th, 1938. CBS Broadcasts Orson Wells' The War of the Worlds. A small Washington town reacts poorly.Did you like the video?  Well, then you are going to LOVE the comic book.Concrete Martians written by Mitch Cook, illustrated by Keith Grachow - October 30th 1938, Orson Wells produces a radio show for Halloween. The Mercury Theatre Presents, H.G. Wells The War of the Worlds.The tiny lumber/concrete town of Concrete, Washington, becomes the epicenter of Martian Invasion Hysteria when, at just the point when the Martians in the radio play attack, the power goes out and so do the phones.The power that radio displayed in those early days of mass media showed us that, even without meaning to, the theatre of the mind can and often does wreak havoc amongst the masses. Local sheriff Ted ""Teddy"" Wilson has his hands full when a radio play combined with a powerful electrical storm stirs up Martian invasion fever amongst the residents of Concrete, Washington.  As the rains progress an overburdened power substation decides to quit. Of course this only fuels the hysteria and ""proves"" that the Martians are indeed invading with cruel intent.In the end, the story is revealed to be merely a radio theatre play .Most, if not all of the town’s people felt understandably embarrassed and went on to live their lives. However what happened on that day was never fully documented, and that's where our story takes us. This story is to be presented in two installments (52 pages total) but can be combined into one graphic novel. It isn't a terribly long story as the events take place in a matter of hours and just one stormy night.Interspersed within the narrative is a retelling of the Mercury Theatre’s War of the Worlds broadcast. Up until the power goes out anyway.The events depicted are based on anecdotal evidence by people who experienced them. Newspaper reports from Concrete, Washington have aided in telling this story.　 Many such events occurred across the country that night.　Goals, Stretch Goals, and RewardsWe need to raise a minimum of $2500 to produce the first issue, 22 pages of limited color digital art. With this amount we will be able to create a digital copy that we can send out to all of our donors as well as apply to digital web comic sites like Comixology.Each page costs $200 to produce, so, for every $200 contributed, we add another page. It would be nice to provide full color, or even a full 52 page graphic novel. So we are relying on you.  Every little bit helps. We are limiting the type of rewards offered for donations because the costs associated with fulfilling the rewards, producing, shipping, etc, defeats the purpose of the donations. We do have stretch goals if we get over the $2500. Really this is just the start. $3500- If we reach $3500 we will include actual printed copies of the completed book at specific donation levels. Reaching more donations means completing more of the book.  Beyond $3500- So a 52 page complete story in limited color, printed and shipped will cost a much larger amount. So anything beyond $3500 would be a great help!We have received a generous gift already and that has allowed us to get started on this project and keep the remaining costs down.  That is why our asking price isn't HUGE!(Shipping copies is $6 US and Canadian addresses and $20 International.  FYI) 

 















 
 
Who are we?Mitch R CookWriter – Bio
I am so glad that evidence of my past comic book experience is buried in a municipal waste site somewhere in Washington State. It would be embarrassing indeed to have that cassette tape of me reading an old Fantastic Four book out loud come to attention. 　(Yes, I read it out loud to a cassette tape recorder. Yes, I did all the voices; ALL the voices. Nope, not proud of that achievement. It was a good book though.)
Flash forward 30 years. (Yeah, it took 30 years to get to this point)　With a public school education, Community College radio shifts, The Edward R Murrow School at Washington State University, a marriage, a graduate degree, a divorce, another marriage, a TV job in Seattle. . . all a part of my history. Now, finally, I return to writing. I just never thought it would be a comic book.
The comic book format has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. My brain has clearly been influenced by the pace of that form of storytelling. I never can tell a story to a group of people quickly.
I have been working on and off as a Broadcaster since 1991 as a student employee at KWSU and Prime Sports.  I had been the Production director(s) for Green River Community College’s Newspaper AND KGRG simultaneously.  I even spent a year in Yuma, Arizona as a Creative Services Producer/Director.  In 2006 I got back into Radio at CBS Radio Seattle in Promotions.  Yeah, I was the old man of the crew, but I enjoyed the work.  Then KOMO Called and the rest is history.  It was with Fisher that I discover the story of how the WOTW Broadcast effected the tiny town of Concrete Washington.  I HAD to tell their story.
Keith Grachow　Illustrator -　BioGrowing up with art through his father's advertising agency, led to a BFA with a focus in graphic design. He's worked as an artist doing concept designs for a dance club to being the in-house artist for Play Along Toys. They are the toy company that made the Britney Spears' dolls and produced licensed toys such as Care Bears. He's also worked on two Disney movies through the animation company Yowza, digitally inking and painting on the traditionally animated films ""The Princess and the Frog"" and ""Winnie the Pooh"". He's traveled to many parts of the world and stayed in Japan for a few years, where he taught English. He runs a studio that he's the co-owner of, JnK Imagery, creating personalized illustrations for his clients while his wife does wedding and boudoir photography. Currently, he's working on the graphic novel Concrete Martians and the second book in the children's book series, On a planet named Up-In-the-Sky, called What would Slog Do?

called “Illustration Around the World.”</p>
<p>My
dream was to one day make an illustrated book that showcased my work,

spent a lot of time thinking about this and one day, I thought, “Why
should I tell a fictional story when I can be the main character of
my own story? I can combine my 2 favorite activities, traveling and
drawing, and in this way meet other artists along the way and learn
from their experiences!”

Hello!

Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Indonesia. I ended up filling my
sketchbooks with drawings. 
I met a lot of artists, such as Devilrobots, Aki, Dan Matutina, Kenny Wong, Diela Maharanie – plus many more! It was Awesome!The

<p><strong>Welcome to Metropo with its gleaming spires and forgotten depths. A city so vast and dense it almost feels alive. Artificial or otherwise, its denizens struggle with familiar heartache and tackle questions we are only beginning to ask.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This ‘slice of cyberpunk life’ collection takes us into the hearts and minds of these denizens, presenting eight stories from the lives of those in the unending city.</strong></p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>PRE//ORDER</h3>
<p><i><strong>METROPO eight stories from the unending city</strong></i> was successfully funded through Kickstarter in January 2018. Due to a high demand of people, and androids, reaching out to us who missed the Kickstarter campaign but would like to pre-order, we decided to make this IndieGoGo to run a 14-day pre-order campaign.</p>
<p>The more pre-orders we get, the brighter the future for the book. As 2018 evolves we will be pitching the book to publishers, hoping to do a regular edition in 2019/2020 with wide distribution. The better this initial limited edition version of the book fares, the higher our chances.</p>
<p>This 14-days window will not delay the printing and shipping of Metropo, which is set to release/ship in April 2018.</p>
<p>So if you missed out, or some of your science fiction friends did, here's your chance to enter the unending city and become a citizen!</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Metropo is inspired by the tech (r)evolution we live in, and the ever-present scientific and philosophical discussions on what life will be like in the near future. It is inspired by a breadth of science fiction, from <i>Brave New World</i> to <i>Deus Ex</i> to <i>Her</i>. Touching on ideas about artificial intelligence, architecture, class and the notion of the self and consciousness (human and otherwise) in a world saturated by technology. But most importantly, a heartfelt, poetic, fun and aching journey through the walkways, airlanes, rooms and rooftops in the thick of Metropo.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>PRINTING//SHIPPING</h3>
<p>We're partnering with a tried and trusted megacorporation from Sector 5 in Metropo—<strong>KrakenPrint</strong>. Our HQ have used them for both printing and fulfilment for the Spiral Kickstarter campaign, as well as printing the Earthlock one-shot comic. With more than satisfactory results.</p>

</div></div>","Welcome to Metropo with its gleaming spires and forgotten depths. A city so vast and dense it almost feels alive. Artificial or otherwise, its denizens struggle with familiar heartache and tackle questions we are only beginning to ask.
This ‘slice of cyberpunk life’ collection takes us into the hearts and minds of these denizens, presenting eight stories from the lives of those in the unending city.



 
METROPO eight stories from the unending city includes these stories:
Raindrop Hatch (comic)The Fierce Code (prose)Temporal (prose)Automobile (comic)Walkways (comic)Drowning (prose)Every Moment is a Moment Forward (comic)Sunrise (prose)

 
PRE//ORDER
METROPO eight stories from the unending city was successfully funded through Kickstarter in January 2018. Due to a high demand of people, and androids, reaching out to us who missed the Kickstarter campaign but would like to pre-order, we decided to make this IndieGoGo to run a 14-day pre-order campaign.
The more pre-orders we get, the brighter the future for the book. As 2018 evolves we will be pitching the book to publishers, hoping to do a regular edition in 2019/2020 with wide distribution. The better this initial limited edition version of the book fares, the higher our chances.
This 14-days window will not delay the printing and shipping of Metropo, which is set to release/ship in April 2018.
So if you missed out, or some of your science fiction friends did, here's your chance to enter the unending city and become a citizen!
 
//PERKS
All perks include shipping.

FOR APPAREL//MERCH, PLEASE VISIT DESIGN FROM THE UNENDING CITY:

 
TASTE//INSPIRATION






 
Metropo is inspired by the tech (r)evolution we live in, and the ever-present scientific and philosophical discussions on what life will be like in the near future. It is inspired by a breadth of science fiction, from Brave New World to Deus Ex to Her. Touching on ideas about artificial intelligence, architecture, class and the notion of the self and consciousness (human and otherwise) in a world saturated by technology. But most importantly, a heartfelt, poetic, fun and aching journey through the walkways, airlanes, rooms and rooftops in the thick of Metropo.
 
PRINTING//SHIPPING
We're partnering with a tried and trusted megacorporation from Sector 5 in Metropo—KrakenPrint. Our HQ have used them for both printing and fulfilment for the Spiral Kickstarter campaign, as well as printing the Earthlock one-shot comic. With more than satisfactory results.

SOCIAL//MEDIA
All Metropo visitors and citizens, artificial or otherwise, are encouraged to join the construction of the unending city on our newsletter & social media sites.




 
//CREATORS

 

Magnus Aspli // A robot from Norway who has written comics and screenplays for nearly a decade. Magnus is currently working on building Metropo on several fronts, while also being involved in a few film and TV projects, plus a game. He’s been shipped and updated at universities in both Brisbane and London, but now lives in Trondheim with his family, raising kids and raising hell.

Vivian Truong // Vivian says she’s a short Chinese artist from London, but as you can tell, she might be a digital self-representation of a cartoon character. Rumour claims she’s a rogue AI, but the fun and benevolent kind. Vivian has a Patreon you could hack into to discover more of her work.

Mary (Cryoclaire) Safro // Mary is a Russian cyber-junkie comic artist, saving the Queen in the UK. She’s the co-creator of Drugs & Wires. A retro-90s Eastern cyberpunk webcomic about everything going wrong. It updates on Mondays and you should head back to the 90s to check it out.

Naomi Franquiz // Naomi, according to her neural net, is a freelance illustrator, comic artist, and reprobate. (We’re still not sure if she’s an android or not.) She built Every Moment is a Moment Forward—the final short comic in Metropo—with her brilliant flavour and style. Make sure to check out her comic Misfit City, published by Boom!

<p><strong>HI, I'M LEA HERNANDEZ</strong></p>
<p>I'm raising money for the production and printing of Book One (of four) of my sixth graphic novel, a full-color vampire comedy called THE GARLICKS, and I need your help to bring it to life (and print)!<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>THE GARLICKS is told from the point of view of Pandora Garlick, a teenage vampire with zero vampire abilities. </p>
<p>Me, I'm an award-winning cartoonist who's worked on comics like <em>The Little Mermaid</em> (for Disney), <em>Girl Comics</em> (for Marvel, and starring Magneto and Wolverine), Star Wars: <em>Droids</em> (for Dark Horse) and created three graphic novels for Young Adults: <em>Cathedral Child, Clockwork Angels </em>and<em> Rumble Girls</em>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE GARLICKS, THE BOOK</strong></p>

<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>""Lea's stuff is terrific.""</em>-- Neil Gaiman (<em>Coraline, The Graveyard Book</em>)</p>
<p>Our supernatural hero, Pandora Garlick, is the big sister of baby Pamila (who's usually called Ham), who seems to have gotten everything Pandora didn't, like being able to shapeshift into a winsome (and annoying) flying fish and a taste for meat. </p>
<p>Here's what The Garlicks is going to look like in color:</p>
<p><img alt=""GArlicks pilot color"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8004/7248941832_f2ae184104_z.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>And here, for your readng pleasure, is The Garlicks' six-page ""pilot"" story:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Pandora, with no answers for why she isn't a proper vampire, turns to her passion, making comics, and chooses her family as her muses: the exhausting Ham, her vampire father Vourdain Garlick (a flower-eating barista), her human mother Olive Garlick (a baker-turned-butcher), and their home/business, Orange Espresso and Meats.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Olive Garlick (human, butcher) and Vourdain (vampire, barista):</p>

<p> </p>
<p>When Pandora steals a blanket (and granny panties) to hide fishbat-Ham after yet another chase through their neighborhood, she brings herself and Ham to the attention of not only Maxim, a friendly boy who can see monsters, but also three rock-stupid, very dangerous, demon-hunting angels.</p>
<p>Pan quickly finds out that the only thing worse than having no time to draw stories is having entirely too much material to draw<em> from</em>. How will Pandora, with supposedly no supernatural abilities, save her family from a supernatural threat?</p>
<p><em>""...funny, human, silly, gorgeous, sweet and smart,""</em> --Kurt Busiek (<em>Astro City, Marvels</em>)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>READ THE GARLICKS AS IT'S DRAWN FOR THE GRAPHIC NOVEL!</strong></p>
<p>I'll be serializing THE GARLICKS Book One (of four), three color pages a week, over the next four or five months as a webcomic at thegarlicks.net and pages will appear here in updates.</p>
<p>When Pandora's first story is complete and still piping hot, it'll be collected into full-color print trade of 60 pages, with an introduction by Jill Thompson, incredible creator of the Halloween classic <em>SCARY GODMOTHER</em>! (Who better, right?)</p>
<p><em>""Lovely work.""</em>--Jim Lee (artist of <em>Justice League</em>, co-publisher, DC Comics)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>GOODIES. <em>GOOD</em> GOODIES</strong></p>
<p>I've concocted some fine incentives for you: at just $10., you'll get a PDF copy of the book and a custom magnet of Fishbat. At $25., a signed copy of THE GARLICKS and a print of Astro City writer Kurt Busiek (a huge supporter and friend of The Garlicks) eating a bug (as he has promised to do to help THE GARLICKS see print) or a print of Fishbat and Pandora Garlick!</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>NOW, I <em>DRAW!</em> (AND PRINT AND MAIL...)</strong></p>
<p>The money raised for THE GARLICKS will go towards the production and printing of the first of four planned volumes and to make and mail out incentives. I'll be writing, drawing, and assembling THE GARLICKS full time for about five months, then shepherding it through printing, THEN signing and mailing them for another two months! (It takes a LOT of hours to address and stuff and post books. I have to start making packages in November to be ready when THE GARLICKS is printed next year!)</p>
<p><strong>SHARE!</strong></p>
<p>Even if you can't contribute money, or if you want to do more (oh please do more!) you can still be part of Team Garlicks (or Team Fishbat or Team Pandora or Team Rock-Stupid Angels), by spreading the word about THE GARLICKS via Twitter, Facebook, tumblr, and Pinterest. Everything helps, and I will be very grateful!</p>

In the meantime, mailable incentives will be mailed: sketch sets, magnets, sketches, prints.
Speaking of magnets, here's the art for those:

Thanks, as always, for your support!
FOOD, FOLKS and FANGS!
Lea
 
AND WE'RE DONE!
Thank you, this has been INCREDIBLE! (Which means, ""Swooping and yawing from despair to 'HELL YEAH I'M A GENIUS!""')
I want to tell you: doing an indiegogo/Kickstarter campaign is harder than you think. I did two in six months because I believe in my vampire kids, and I'm also a fan of that winning feeling. Oh, how I love that feeling.
More people to thank in no particular order!
Jill Thompson, who's writing the intro for THE GARLICKS Book One and wow!
Samax Amen from Ghettomanga, Brian Truitt at USA Today, Henry Barajas at The Beat. Adam Warren helped me edit for near-maximum awesomeness. NYT bestselling author of Seraphina Rachel Hartman because she is AWESOME. 
My daughter, Summer. My son, Fox. My boyfriend David. My best friend Lisa Jonte. 
Kurt Busiek gets mentioned one more time for helping me re-tool THE GARLICKS so it could have a successful campaign. He did it because he's selfish, but full marks anyway.
ALSO @NeilaK20 and @Cattype for going way far out to support THE GARLICKS on Twitter. Ladies.
Everyone, just EVERYONE. YOU GALS AND GUYS.
AND HERE WE ARE.
When incentives other than books are ready to mail, there'll be updates. 
I'll make you the BEST DARN BOOK about vampire baristas, vampire graphic novelists, Italian butchers and fishbats EVER, and for girls. 
FOOD, FAMILY AND FANGS FOREVER!
See you Monday!

HI, I'M LEA HERNANDEZ
I'm raising money for the production and printing of Book One (of four) of my sixth graphic novel, a full-color vampire comedy called THE GARLICKS, and I need your help to bring it to life (and print)!
THE GARLICKS is told from the point of view of Pandora Garlick, a teenage vampire with zero vampire abilities. 
Me, I'm an award-winning cartoonist who's worked on comics like The Little Mermaid (for Disney), Girl Comics (for Marvel, and starring Magneto and Wolverine), Star Wars: Droids (for Dark Horse) and created three graphic novels for Young Adults: Cathedral Child, Clockwork Angels and Rumble Girls.
 
THE GARLICKS, THE BOOK

 
""Lea's stuff is terrific.""-- Neil Gaiman (Coraline, The Graveyard Book)
Our supernatural hero, Pandora Garlick, is the big sister of baby Pamila (who's usually called Ham), who seems to have gotten everything Pandora didn't, like being able to shapeshift into a winsome (and annoying) flying fish and a taste for meat. 
Here's what The Garlicks is going to look like in color:

And here, for your readng pleasure, is The Garlicks' six-page ""pilot"" story:

 

 

 



 
Pandora, with no answers for why she isn't a proper vampire, turns to her passion, making comics, and chooses her family as her muses: the exhausting Ham, her vampire father Vourdain Garlick (a flower-eating barista), her human mother Olive Garlick (a baker-turned-butcher), and their home/business, Orange Espresso and Meats.
 
Olive Garlick (human, butcher) and Vourdain (vampire, barista):

 
When Pandora steals a blanket (and granny panties) to hide fishbat-Ham after yet another chase through their neighborhood, she brings herself and Ham to the attention of not only Maxim, a friendly boy who can see monsters, but also three rock-stupid, very dangerous, demon-hunting angels.
Pan quickly finds out that the only thing worse than having no time to draw stories is having entirely too much material to draw from. How will Pandora, with supposedly no supernatural abilities, save her family from a supernatural threat?
""...funny, human, silly, gorgeous, sweet and smart,"" --Kurt Busiek (Astro City, Marvels)
 
READ THE GARLICKS AS IT'S DRAWN FOR THE GRAPHIC NOVEL!
I'll be serializing THE GARLICKS Book One (of four), three color pages a week, over the next four or five months as a webcomic at thegarlicks.net and pages will appear here in updates.
When Pandora's first story is complete and still piping hot, it'll be collected into full-color print trade of 60 pages, with an introduction by Jill Thompson, incredible creator of the Halloween classic SCARY GODMOTHER! (Who better, right?)
""Lovely work.""--Jim Lee (artist of Justice League, co-publisher, DC Comics)
 
GOODIES. GOOD GOODIES
I've concocted some fine incentives for you: at just $10., you'll get a PDF copy of the book and a custom magnet of Fishbat. At $25., a signed copy of THE GARLICKS and a print of Astro City writer Kurt Busiek (a huge supporter and friend of The Garlicks) eating a bug (as he has promised to do to help THE GARLICKS see print) or a print of Fishbat and Pandora Garlick!
 
KURT BUSIEK EATS A BUG PRINT:
 
 
FISHBAT AND PANDORA GARLICK PRINT:

 
FISHBAT PLUSH!

 
PANDORA'S ART KIT (scope this pic!):

 
PAN'S DREAM BAG (the gloriously extravagant custom messenger bag stuffed with books and goodies):

Even a chance to appear in THE GARLICKS as a character!
 
NOW, I DRAW! (AND PRINT AND MAIL...)
The money raised for THE GARLICKS will go towards the production and printing of the first of four planned volumes and to make and mail out incentives. I'll be writing, drawing, and assembling THE GARLICKS full time for about five months, then shepherding it through printing, THEN signing and mailing them for another two months! (It takes a LOT of hours to address and stuff and post books. I have to start making packages in November to be ready when THE GARLICKS is printed next year!)
SHARE!
Even if you can't contribute money, or if you want to do more (oh please do more!) you can still be part of Team Garlicks (or Team Fishbat or Team Pandora or Team Rock-Stupid Angels), by spreading the word about THE GARLICKS via Twitter, Facebook, tumblr, and Pinterest. Everything helps, and I will be very grateful!

<p>Welcome to our Fundraiser page!</p>
<p><strong>'</strong><strong>Star Wars: The Search for Windu'</strong> is a non-profit fan based graphic novel set in the Star Wars universe. The comic is a 4 part series about 65 pages in length. Its got action, drama, the return of iconic Star Wars characters, and a bit of humor as well. Its a <strong>Parody </strong>that pokes fun at Star Wars as well as a heartfelt a story written by SW fans for SW fans in honor of the incredible universe George Lucas created.</p>
<p>Right now the script is finished, comic panels designed, concept art on the way, and artists are ready and itching to begin production. All we need now is the funds to produce the comic.</p>

<p>The comic is set between 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi'. Its about Luke Skywalker who is sent by Obi Wan's spirit to find a new master. His search for this new teacher takes him to the heart of the Empire on Corosant where Luke discovers that the Jedi Master he seeks is none other than Mace Windu who miraculously survived the events of Episode 3.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the aged Windu has become jaded by the events that have transpired since the rise of the Empire. He's given up on the Jedi ways and lives a simple life running a saloon in the Coruscant red light district. Its up to Luke to not only convince Mace to train him but also restore the old man's hope for a better galaxy.</p>
<p><strong>'</strong><strong>The Search for Windu'</strong> is a story that deals with profoundly deep themes. At its heart the comic is about redemption and hope. Its also about taking up crusades and not being afraid to take risks no matter what might happen.
