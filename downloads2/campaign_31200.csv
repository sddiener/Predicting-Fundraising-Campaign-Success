<p><em>     Located in Western Uganda and near to the border of the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Kyangwali Refugee Settlement hosts approximately 25,000 predominantly Congolese and Sudanese Refugees including a small </em><em>percentage of Rwandese, Burundians, Somalis, and Ethiopians. Due to tribal conflicts, corruption and violation of human rights caused by irresponsible </em><em>leadership and an underpowered community, they were forced to leave their home countries.

<p>      Here are notes from praised professionals on violence and aggression in the DR Congo. Please feel free to follow the links to learn more: </p>
<p><em>From 1996 until the present, The Eastern DR Congo has experienced a death toll of an estimated 6 million lives in the struggle for control over the nation's abundant natural resources, including but not limited to: Gold, Diamonds, Copper, Cobalt, Coltan, Zinc, Niobium, Titanium, Manganese, Uranium, Iron and Tin.</em></p>

<p><em>Rape happened to be one of the weapons that worked the most because as soon as you destabilize a community, you rape the entire village in front of the children, in </em></p>
<p><em>front of the husband, in front of the neighbors. That community is broken completely.</em></p>

<p><em>It has nothing to do with Ethnicity. They killed Congolese like flies.</em></p>
<p>- Kambale Musavuli - Congolese Human Rights Activist: <a href=""http://kambale.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://kambale.com/</a> </p>
<p><em>     As of November 2012, more than 2.4 million Congolese were internally displaced and more than 460,000 had become refugees in neighboring countries. Myriad armed groups threaten civilians in North Kivu, South Kivu and Orientale provinces, uprooting families from their homes and taking away their livelihoods when not killing or raping them outright.</em></p>

<p><em>     Every month, 45,000 more Congolese—half of them children—die from hunger, preventable disease, and other consequences of violence and displacement. Over one million people have fled their homes within Congo as a result of the ongoing conflict. Eastern Congo right now is perhaps the worst place in the world to be a woman. Used as a weapon of war, rape in Congo exists on a scale seen nowhere else in the world. Often successful in its intent to destroy and exterminate, rape as </em></p>
<p><em>a weapon of war is causing the near total destruction of women, their families, and their communities.</em></p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>IV. Root Causes of Violence and Aggression in Conflict Areas of the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>     An extensive and comprehensive analysis of the root causes of violence and aggression in conflict areas of the eastern DRC will be performed with the refugees by way of formal and informal interviews. Along with already existing information and statistics, Revolution participants should be able to formulate concise ideas about the root causes and what they are definitively if they already have not. This information will be added and posted to the project webpage and online users will be able to view and comment on it directly with the refugees at Kyangwali.</p>
<p>     The following have been expressed as major concerns already from CIYOTA leaders: irresponsible leadership and an underpowered community; lack of education or skills to allow village members to solve their own problems, both in the refugee camp and back in their home countries and; lack of skilled, principled and visionary leaders who stand against many odds in Kyangwali and beyond.</p>
<p>     The following is an identification of root causes from The Enough Project:</p>
<p><em>     The current crisis in eastern Congo illustrates the historical patterns at the root of this conflict: as long as the Congolese government cannot control its territory, provide basic services or effectively protect its population, and as long as armed groups are able to prosper from illicit trade in natural resources and complex </em><em>regional alliances, Eastern Congo will remain a battlefield and innocent civilians will pay a tragically high cost.</em></p>

<p> </p>
<p>     This portion of the research plan requires a vast compilation of reliable sources from the ground. This project is going to make that possible.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>V. Refugees at the Kyangwali Refugee Settlement Target Root Causes of Violence and Aggression in Conflict Areas of the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>     The Kyangwali Revolution primarily seeks to empower refugees at the settlement to target the root causes of violence and aggression in their home countries.</p>
<p>     Via extensive and proven leadership training with Educate!, an organization that develops young leaders and entrepreneurs in Uganda, by providing long-term mentorship and two-years of world-class leadership and entrepreneurship training to help high school students start enterprises that solve poverty, disease, violence and environmental degradation, the Kyangwali Refugees will grow empowered and prepared to accomplish Revolution Goals for themselves. Educate! has also partnered with The Government of Uganda and the UN International Labor Organization (ILO) to incorporate its leadership and entrepreneurship curriculum into the national education system. The curriculum now reaches 25,000 students annually. More information on the Educate! leadership curriculum can be found here: <a href=""http://www.experienceeducate.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.experienceeducate.org/</a>.</p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p><strong>VI. Decreased Violence and Aggression</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Kyangwali Revolution Goal 1:</strong><em> </em>Refugees at Kyangwali identify and alleviate root causes of conflict in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and thus hostile areas experience decreased levels of violence and aggression.</p>
<p>     This is for very many reasons a long-term and sustained goal, but a lot of the foundation can be set within the first year.</p>
<p>     Monitoring and evaluation will be based on but not limited to the development of social media websites with compelling evidence like eyewitness ideas and accounts from Kyangwali Revolutionaries and oppositional parties, videos, pictures and credible statistics concerning identification of and solutions to root causes of conflict from partnered NPOs such as the UNHCR, Government of Uganda and Educate! - An organization that already practices reliable monitoring and evaluation systems with equally reliable indicators. Those documents are available upon request and their model will be used as a foundation for this Revolution.</p>
<p>     Lastly, tracking progress will be as interactive as possible for the world, thus ensuring complete transparency and maximum exposure. This will also remedy requirements surrounding supporter relations by allowing them to view progress in real time and by offering continuous opportunities to actively participate as revolutionaries too.<strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>VII.  </strong><strong>Social Media and the Internet as a Catalyst for Empowerment, Action and Change</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Kyangwali Revolution Goal 2:</strong> Exploit the power of technology, The Internet and open social media for the benefit of the Revolution and ensure an extensive and transparent platform for the world to participate as an active decision-maker. Kyangwali is everyone’s revolution.</p>

<p><strong>XI. Budget and Support</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>     As a representative of CIYOTA, and with your help and support I will be traveling to the Kyangwali Refugee Settlement to help address the very concerns that have been expressed by community members: irresponsible leadership and an underpowered community; lack of education or skills to allow village members to solve their own problems, both in the refugee camp and back in their home countries and; lack of skilled, principled and visionary leaders who stand against many odds in Kyangwali and beyond.</p>
<p>     This is a call for support that will allow me to travel and live in Kyangwali for an expected period of at least one year, which as a result will help to accomplish established Kyangwali Revolution Goals. Costs have been budgeted out to cover expenses like: Transportation; Consular; Health; Living; Communications; and Miscellaneous Costs (see detailed budget at the end of this application). Finances will be tracked, accounted for and available for viewing online. There are also possibilities to funnel funds into programming, impact and change, and it will be interesting to see what You, Revolution Supporters would like to see happen with project resources. Voice your opinions here: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kyangwali-Revolution/135263449996137"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kyangwali-Revolution/135263449996137</a></p>
<p>     This revolution can be as interactive as you'd like it to be. We want you to be directly creating change too.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>XII. Other Support</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>     Based on the social nature of the assignment, facilities and the community itself at Kyangwali will suffice more than enough to conduct research with members of the village. Living facilities are secured as described in the budget. Facilities during travel are available, but have to be evaluated more so upon arrival.</p>
<p>     The Kyangwali Revolution campaign is currently active on indiegogo.com, an online funding platform, and can be viewed here: <a href=""http://igg.me/at/Inspire-Social-Revolutions-In-Africa/x/2898921"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://igg.me/at/Inspire-Social-Revolutions-In-Africa/x/2898921</a> This is also another center for project information and updates from the field. Until now, the project has received $105 in monetary support.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>XIII. Protection of Subjects</strong></p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p>     The majority of this research is social in nature and demands the efforts of the people themselves to identify and attack root causes, and create real sustainable change. Considering the CIYOTA and Educate! programs are based on that and their projects follow similar goals too, there already exists an acceptance. They are the ones who inspired me to create this proposal. The following is a diagram and explanation of the CIYOTA model: </p>
<p><em>     In everything we do, a sense of responsibility for community development is fostered, and CIYOTA leaders strive to empower every individual they touch to be a problem-solving, visionary leader for change. Members at local, national and international levels share the principle of developing a united, self-sustained community starting from zero to what great leaders and entrepreneurs have never imagined.</em></p>
<p><em>     The Tri-fold approach coupled with emphasis on strong sense of ownership for the community by the community and passion for Pan-Africa. We understand that to create great leadership and entrepreneurs without character can be detrimental, but also teaching character without leadership and entrepreneurship would leave the current and next generation of leaders unprepared to face the responsibilities and opportunities to make Africa a better place.</em></p>

This information will be added and posted to the project webpage and online users will be able to view and comment on it directly with the refugees at Kyangwali.
     The following have been expressed as major concerns already from CIYOTA leaders: irresponsible leadership and an underpowered community; lack of education or skills to allow village members to solve their own problems, both in the refugee camp and back in their home countries and; lack of skilled, principled and visionary leaders who stand against many odds in Kyangwali and beyond.
     The following is an identification of root causes from The Enough Project:
     The current crisis in eastern Congo illustrates the historical patterns at the root of this conflict: as long as the Congolese government cannot control its territory, provide basic services or effectively protect its population, and as long as armed groups are able to prosper from illicit trade in natural resources and complex regional alliances, Eastern Congo will remain a battlefield and innocent civilians will pay a tragically high cost.
- Enough Project - 'Roots of the Crisis - Congo' - http://www.enoughproject.org/files/pdf/crisis_roots_congo.pdf
 
     This portion of the research plan requires a vast compilation of reliable sources from the ground. This project is going to make that possible.
 
V. Refugees at the Kyangwali Refugee Settlement Target Root Causes of Violence and Aggression in Conflict Areas of the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo
 
     The Kyangwali Revolution primarily seeks to empower refugees at the settlement to target the root causes of violence and aggression in their home countries.
     Via extensive and proven leadership training with Educate!, an organization that develops young leaders and entrepreneurs in Uganda, by providing long-term mentorship and two-years of world-class leadership and entrepreneurship training to help high school students start enterprises that solve poverty, disease, violence and environmental degradation, the Kyangwali Refugees will grow empowered and prepared to accomplish Revolution Goals for themselves. Educate! has also partnered with The Government of Uganda and the UN International Labor Organization (ILO) to incorporate its leadership and entrepreneurship curriculum into the national education system. The curriculum now reaches 25,000 students annually. More information on the Educate! leadership curriculum can be found here: http://www.experienceeducate.org/.
 
VI. Decreased Violence and Aggression
 
Kyangwali Revolution Goal 1: Refugees at Kyangwali identify and alleviate root causes of conflict in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and thus hostile areas experience decreased levels of violence and aggression.
     This is for very many reasons a long-term and sustained goal, but a lot of the foundation can be set within the first year.
     Monitoring and evaluation will be based on but not limited to the development of social media websites with compelling evidence like eyewitness ideas and accounts from Kyangwali Revolutionaries and oppositional parties, videos, pictures and credible statistics concerning identification of and solutions to root causes of conflict from partnered NPOs such as the UNHCR, Government of Uganda and Educate! - An organization that already practices reliable monitoring and evaluation systems with equally reliable indicators. Those documents are available upon request and their model will be used as a foundation for this Revolution.
     Lastly, tracking progress will be as interactive as possible for the world, thus ensuring complete transparency and maximum exposure. This will also remedy requirements surrounding supporter relations by allowing them to view progress in real time and by offering continuous opportunities to actively participate as revolutionaries too. 
 
VII.  Social Media and the Internet as a Catalyst for Empowerment, Action and Change
 
Kyangwali Revolution Goal 2: Exploit the power of technology, The Internet and open social media for the benefit of the Revolution and ensure an extensive and transparent platform for the world to participate as an active decision-maker. Kyangwali is everyone’s revolution.
     The interactive piece of this movement has already begun here: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kyangwali-Revolution/135263449996137 Visit the Kyangwali Revolution Facebook page and start influencing real sustainable change in the Democratic Republic of the Congo now!

XI. Budget and Support
 
     As a representative of CIYOTA, and with your help and support I will be traveling to the Kyangwali Refugee Settlement to help address the very concerns that have been expressed by community members: irresponsible leadership and an underpowered community; lack of education or skills to allow village members to solve their own problems, both in the refugee camp and back in their home countries and; lack of skilled, principled and visionary leaders who stand against many odds in Kyangwali and beyond.
     This is a call for support that will allow me to travel and live in Kyangwali for an expected period of at least one year, which as a result will help to accomplish established Kyangwali Revolution Goals. Costs have been budgeted out to cover expenses like: Transportation; Consular; Health; Living; Communications; and Miscellaneous Costs (see detailed budget at the end of this application). Finances will be tracked, accounted for and available for viewing online. There are also possibilities to funnel funds into programming, impact and change, and it will be interesting to see what You, Revolution Supporters would like to see happen with project resources. Voice your opinions here: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kyangwali-Revolution/135263449996137
     This revolution can be as interactive as you'd like it to be. We want you to be directly creating change too.
     CIYOTA is a United States registered 501(c)3 charity with tax id number 27-309274.
 
XII. Other Support
 
     Based on the social nature of the assignment, facilities and the community itself at Kyangwali will suffice more than enough to conduct research with members of the village. Living facilities are secured as described in the budget. Facilities during travel are available, but have to be evaluated more so upon arrival.
     The Kyangwali Revolution campaign is currently active on indiegogo.com, an online funding platform, and can be viewed here: http://igg.me/at/Inspire-Social-Revolutions-In-Africa/x/2898921 This is also another center for project information and updates from the field. Until now, the project has received $105 in monetary support.
 
XIII. Protection of Subjects
 
     The majority of this research is social in nature and demands the efforts of the people themselves to identify and attack root causes, and create real sustainable change. Considering the CIYOTA and Educate! programs are based on that and their projects follow similar goals too, there already exists an acceptance. They are the ones who inspired me to create this proposal. The following is a diagram and explanation of the CIYOTA model: 
     In everything we do, a sense of responsibility for community development is fostered, and CIYOTA leaders strive to empower every individual they touch to be a problem-solving, visionary leader for change. Members at local, national and international levels share the principle of developing a united, self-sustained community starting from zero to what great leaders and entrepreneurs have never imagined.
     The Tri-fold approach coupled with emphasis on strong sense of ownership for the community by the community and passion for Pan-Africa. We understand that to create great leadership and entrepreneurs without character can be detrimental, but also teaching character without leadership and entrepreneurship would leave the current and next generation of leaders unprepared to face the responsibilities and opportunities to make Africa a better place.

<p>I am Amanda Dibben, a recent graduate from Hollins University, an alternative processes photographer, and a hopeful Poznaniak!</p>
<p>This summer I was accepted for the English language Master's of Arts program at the University of Arts In Poznan (Uniwersytet Artystyczny w Poznaniu) where I hope to expand my love of art and photography, buiding on a unique process of printing photographs on copper and bringing this into printmaking and mixedmedia works. </p>
<p>I was able to attend Hollins University, a prestigious all-women's college, through a full-tuition scholarship based on my academic and leadership abilities. At the time, I never thought I'd get into graduate school, much less one located in Poland. </p>
<p>Even though the costs of attendance in Poland are much less than in the US, I am not able to come up with all the funds myself. The only way students can get a student loan for an international school is if they study law, medicine, or business. But because I'm studying creative arts, I get no federal financial aid and no banks will give me a student loan. This is the reason I've come here to ask you for help.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>For two years of study I need a total of $35,000. I have about a third of it, and am looking at other resources for the rest, but am hoping to raise $7,500 here. </p>
<p>Everything I raise here, whether it's $200 or the full $7,500, will go towards my living expenses: transport costs, my first months of rent and deposit, initial study costs of books and supplies, and general groceries, even if it's Cup Noodles all week long!</p>
<p>If you donate $20 I'll send you a super awesome postcard from Poznan about how amazing you are for helping and how much you should come to the great city of Poznan!</p>
<p>For $100, I'll send you the postcard and a photograph. It'll be an 8x10 signed and numbered photograph of a great landmark I find in Poznan. It will be a digital print with archival ink, so it'll last you a lifetime.</p>
<p>For $300, I'll send you the postcard, the landmark photograph from Poznan, and an additional series of four 8 x 10 archivally printed photographs from Warsaw, Krakow, and Poznan.</p>
<p>Then there's the big one. If you donate $1,000 I will send you one of my copper pieces. The image and the piece will be the only one like it in the world, not even I can replicate them. They are signed and framed. There is a further description below and you can see images of my pieces at vault13photography.weebly.com.</p>
<h3><strong>More Information</strong></h3>
<p>My final project for my Studio Art Bachelor's was a series of portraits printed on copper. Since I started experimenting and researching my process, I have not been able to find any other artist that does the same thing and creates photographs like mine. The reason it is so unique is that the image is developed directly onto the copper, there is no digital printing or transferring of the image. This was a very time intensive project as I had to discover everything for myself, although I had a ton of help with ideas and presentation from my advisors and professors. </p>
<p>In May, I presented my final project of 13 images and graduated cum laude with a Margaret Markley Smith Award for Studio Art from Hollins University.</p>
<p>I feel that it is important to share my art and continue it in the world. I want other young artists to be able to see what I do and let it inspire themselves to create something new. I think all too often young artists have a belief that it's all been done before, but it hasn't. There are always new ways to see and create art. This is the idea I want to bring to Poland, to be able to see art with a new group people and experience what they feel and think when I present works to them.</p>
<p>Also, I think the hardest goal of mine is to learn Polish while I'm there. Languages have always been hard for me!</p>

<h3>UPDATE: 100% of the funds go to SIS; the university in general will not see any of it.  You do NOT need to be affiliated with SIS to donate!  The wider our support, the more powerful our message!  Thanks everybody!</h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><em>Academia is ALL politics, and any loss of power, symbolic or otherwise, is HUGE.</em></p>
<p>With the University of the Pacific's recent decision to have the College of the Pacific (COP) absorb the School of International Studies (SIS), alumni, students, and friends of SIS have spoken out in defense of the unique program.  The decision was announced August 23rd and the plan is to be in place by October 1st without any input from current, past, and future students. That means that all students who are currently enrolled and may have chosen Pacific for its autonomous SIS (not to mention those on their way) and have been paying tuition for years will be out of luck. </p>
<p>Most importantly, <span>faculty evaluation/promotion and tenure, academic standards, curriculum, etc., will be merged with the College. The College Dean and College committees will be the relevant authorities for those processes.</span></p>
<p>While we should continue to write letters, post comments, and let the school know that we <strong>do not</strong> support their decision, the fact remains that <em><strong>money speaks volumes more than words to a private university.  </strong></em></p>
<p>Whether or not the university will reconsider its decision remains to be seen, but we can send this very clear message: SIS alums and friend <em>care</em> about the school and are willing to donate... but we can happily take our dollars elsewhere.  Should the university continue with this plan we will no longer be alumni of a school, and our alumni dollars will have nowhere to go.  Donations will cease.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As such, we propose that we raise $5,000 to donate with the express purpose that it be given to the School of International Studies' endowment.  Whether or not the university will reconsider their action, this money will go a long way in helping the school maintain the programs that will be at risk to be cut.  For this year, SIS has been assured that their budget will remain intact.  Again and again the provost has said ""for now"" and ""this year,"" but they have been very strategic in refusing to make any long-term promises.  The signs are clear that the SIS budget may be at risk.</p>
<p>When we donate the money, we are allowed to specifically state <em>exactly </em>what its use will be.  We can decide to use it for SIS student scholarships, faculty/student research grants, etc.  What we decide to use it for will depend on how much money we raise, but the money <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">will</span> go directly to SIS.</p>
<p>As we continue in our campaign for the preservation of our home, we will draft a donation letter, on which every donor's name will be included.  The more you donate, the higher your name will be in separate tiers.  We sadly cannot do physical perks, but we are open to suggestions should anybody have any.</p>
<p>Help us, as Provost Pallavicini claims the purpose of this reorganization is, ""extend and enhance international education at University of the Pacific</p>
<p>If we do not reach our entire goal, we will receive a percentage of the funds and still be able to donate some money to the school.  $5,000 is a big enough number that sends an enormous message and <strong><em>only requires 50 people to donate</em> $100. <br/></strong>Of course, we are hoping to break that number at hit at least $5,000.  If you cannot give $100, give what you can!  Even $10 is appreciated!</p>
<p>Why $5,000?  It is both a realistic and significant goal that is attainable with your and your families' help.  It was recently suggested to me that SIS alums and their supporters can only raise ""tens of thousands of cents.""  At most, that would be $999.99.  Let's prove him wrong.</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Success of SIS and the Failure of Pacific</h2>
<p>SIS has turned out award winning students year after year.  Each year the school is trumpeted by the university as an amazing program that produces these prestigious award winners, but every admissions initiative and marketing plan has left SIS in the dust.  Being the only School of International Studies, SIS could have positioned itself as the alternative to the East Coast DC pull.  With the proper guidance, support, and funding, SIS could have been huge, as evidence below.  Students, however, knew the university saw SIS as a low priority after the Arabic class fiasco that hurt SIS's position in academia for years to follow.</p>

Short Summary
Academia is ALL politics, and any loss of power, symbolic or otherwise, is HUGE.
With the University of the Pacific's recent decision to have the College of the Pacific (COP) absorb the School of International Studies (SIS), alumni, students, and friends of SIS have spoken out in defense of the unique program.  The decision was announced August 23rd and the plan is to be in place by October 1st without any input from current, past, and future students. That means that all students who are currently enrolled and may have chosen Pacific for its autonomous SIS (not to mention those on their way) and have been paying tuition for years will be out of luck. 
Most importantly, faculty evaluation/promotion and tenure, academic standards, curriculum, etc., will be merged with the College. The College Dean and College committees will be the relevant authorities for those processes.
While we should continue to write letters, post comments, and let the school know that we do not support their decision, the fact remains that money speaks volumes more than words to a private university.  
Whether or not the university will reconsider its decision remains to be seen, but we can send this very clear message: SIS alums and friend care about the school and are willing to donate... but we can happily take our dollars elsewhere.  Should the university continue with this plan we will no longer be alumni of a school, and our alumni dollars will have nowhere to go.  Donations will cease.


What We Need & What You Get
As such, we propose that we raise $5,000 to donate with the express purpose that it be given to the School of International Studies' endowment.  Whether or not the university will reconsider their action, this money will go a long way in helping the school maintain the programs that will be at risk to be cut.  For this year, SIS has been assured that their budget will remain intact.  Again and again the provost has said ""for now"" and ""this year,"" but they have been very strategic in refusing to make any long-term promises.  The signs are clear that the SIS budget may be at risk.
When we donate the money, we are allowed to specifically state exactly what its use will be.  We can decide to use it for SIS student scholarships, faculty/student research grants, etc.  What we decide to use it for will depend on how much money we raise, but the money will go directly to SIS.
As we continue in our campaign for the preservation of our home, we will draft a donation letter, on which every donor's name will be included.  The more you donate, the higher your name will be in separate tiers.  We sadly cannot do physical perks, but we are open to suggestions should anybody have any.
Help us, as Provost Pallavicini claims the purpose of this reorganization is, ""extend and enhance international education at University of the Pacific
If we do not reach our entire goal, we will receive a percentage of the funds and still be able to donate some money to the school.  $5,000 is a big enough number that sends an enormous message and only requires 50 people to donate $100. Of course, we are hoping to break that number at hit at least $5,000.  If you cannot give $100, give what you can!  Even $10 is appreciated!
Why $5,000?  It is both a realistic and significant goal that is attainable with your and your families' help.  It was recently suggested to me that SIS alums and their supporters can only raise ""tens of thousands of cents.""  At most, that would be $999.99.  Let's prove him wrong.

 
The Success of SIS and the Failure of Pacific
SIS has turned out award winning students year after year.  Each year the school is trumpeted by the university as an amazing program that produces these prestigious award winners, but every admissions initiative and marketing plan has left SIS in the dust.  Being the only School of International Studies, SIS could have positioned itself as the alternative to the East Coast DC pull.  With the proper guidance, support, and funding, SIS could have been huge, as evidence below.  Students, however, knew the university saw SIS as a low priority after the Arabic class fiasco that hurt SIS's position in academia for years to follow.

<p><strong>WE ARE EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE WERE JUST INVITED TO EXTEND OUR PROGRAMMING THROUGH THE FALL</strong>, <strong>WITH A FULL RUN IN NOVEMBER</strong>!</p>
<p><strong><em>We have just met our initial goal for summer programming! Now, with 1 DAY left...lets double this! </em></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i55.photobucket.com/albums/g150/freeda44/truthworkertheatreheader_zpsf8778e4d.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p><em>Truthworker Theatre Compan</em>y, founded and directed by Samara Gaev, is launching <em>this</em> <em>summer! </em>We are a social justice based, hip-hop theatre company for high school and college aged youth in Brooklyn, NY. </p>
<p>For over a decade, I have been working as a youth theatre director and educator for grassroots arts organizations and cultural institutions throughout New York City. The relationships that I have cultivated with young artists and activists over the years have been truly transformative. The most impactful exchange as a teaching artist is that moment when my students express their hunger to continue developing their craft under my direction.</p>
<p><em><strong>Truthworker Theatre Company</strong></em><strong> is intent upon providing </strong>free programming for young visionaries and performers to receive rigorous professional training <em>this summer</em>. Summer intensives in the arts are often costly and, consequently, are limited to only those who can afford them.<strong> </strong>I am determined to continue the momentum with this powerful community of young people and offer them<strong> </strong>the space, the training and the creative direction, as well as opportunities to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collectively devise</li>
<li>
<p>Work with guest artists</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>See live performance in the city</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perform original work in a professional theatre. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>In addition to offering a free, safe space for creation, collaboration, and learning, I hope to provide a stipend to each young company member who fully commits to and completes the project. This stipend is my affirmation of valuing the arts as an avenue for sustainable career paths and life choices. I want these young artists to take themselves seriously, know their value, and believe that the arts can truly be a sustainable and legitimate passion. In the face of an economy that continues to cut budgets for the arts in our public school system, I hope to affirm that if my students approach their craft with discipline and commitment, following the path of the arts can indeed be a tool towards supporting themselves.  </p>
<p>This summer, <em>Truthworker Theatre Company </em>will be working in partnership with<em> JACK </em>-a new performance space located in Clinton Hill. All workshops, rehearsals, and performances will be running out of<em> JACK.</em> Stay tuned for performance details! Projected date: Aug. 11th, 4pm (<a href=""http://www.jackny.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.jackny.org</a>)</p>
<p>Please consider supporting the hard work that <em>Truthworker Theatre Company</em> is deeply committed to. While our full budget for TTC far exceeds what we are asking for here, the amount we are hoping to raise through this campaign will allow us to operate for the four weeks. As we launch this summer, we hope that you can help us meet or exceed our financial goal of $8,000 so that we can bring our programatic visions to fruition.</p>

<p align=""center"">Please help us reach our fundraising goal!</p>
<p>Within the first week, we grew each day both in numbers and as artists and quickly delved into the devising process. By the close of our first week, our 15 member company was already begging for more time to work together as they passionately began to develop an original work called:</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>BAR CODE: A Performative Analysis of the School to Prison Pipeline</strong>. </p>
<p>The devotion of the company members has been remarkable. Each day, we have had 100% attendance with everyone showing up early and staying late--squeezing every second out of our time together. The young members of TTC have been stepping up to the plate in taking on all of the responsibilities of bringing their creative visions to fruition. From gathering statistics and compiling research, to staying up late in the studio mixing and mastering an audio score for their work, each facet of this process has been youth led and driven.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i55.photobucket.com/albums/g150/freeda44/2_zpse793f6f0.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>So many moments have occurred in our society during this short time that we have used as fodder, inspiration, education, and a call for further analysis, but non as poignant as the Zimmerman trial. The verdict landed pretty heavily in the hearts of our young people- stirring up a world of emotions, questions, fears, and demands. It is a great honor and a great challenge to uphold a safe space for learning, reflecting, mobilizing, and truth telling. While I feel so sad that this is the legacy our young one's have inherited, I am all the more charged with encouraging my students to use their art to broadcast the stories that go missing so that we can begin the process of collectively healing and transforming our future.</p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Truthworker Theatre Company</strong> has just completed three vibrant and productive weeks of rigorous programming! We are two weeks away from our final performance on August 11th!</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>BAR CODE: A Performative Analysis of the School to Prison Pipeline</strong></p>
<p>We are so grateful to the guests who have blessed us with their stories and expertise as we strive to create work that reflects the narratives that so often go untold in our communities. As part of programming, I have been committed to bringing bi-weekely speakers and guest artists such as Malik Yoba, Climbing Poetree, and Nsangou Njikam to work with our youth. This last week, we were honored to welcome a powerful guest speaker, Zaki, who came to share with us about his experience with the Prison Industrial Complex as a formerly incarcerated youth who spent 16 years inside from the tender age of 16. He is now a powerful educator, activist, and mentor in the NYC schools, detention centers, and beyond. It was insightful, inspiring, informative and, most importantly, eye opening. </p>

<p>I am blown away by the continued generosity of my community far and wide! There are few things more invigorating than receiving the heartfelt support and faith that each of you has placed in my work and vision. At this point, <strong>we have 2 days left</strong> to surpass our Indiegogo Campaign goal. This is a modest goal for the amount of work and resources that a program like this calls for. Already, the company has requested props, costumes, and set designs that would bring their vision to fruition, not to mention food, water, transportation, and all of the unexpected day-to-day expenses and production costs that have arisen. Having said that, <strong>we hope to exceed $8,000 in the next 2 days</strong> so that not only can their final performance be as powerful as they envision it, but so that we can continue to do this work beyond the summer!</p>

The relationships that I have cultivated with young artists and activists over the years have been truly transformative. The most impactful exchange as a teaching artist is that moment when my students express their hunger to continue developing their craft under my direction.
Truthworker Theatre Company is intent upon providing free programming for young visionaries and performers to receive rigorous professional training this summer. Summer intensives in the arts are often costly and, consequently, are limited to only those who can afford them. I am determined to continue the momentum with this powerful community of young people and offer them the space, the training and the creative direction, as well as opportunities to:

Collectively devise

Work with guest artists




See live performance in the city


Perform original work in a professional theatre. 


 

 

 
In addition to offering a free, safe space for creation, collaboration, and learning, I hope to provide a stipend to each young company member who fully commits to and completes the project. This stipend is my affirmation of valuing the arts as an avenue for sustainable career paths and life choices. I want these young artists to take themselves seriously, know their value, and believe that the arts can truly be a sustainable and legitimate passion. In the face of an economy that continues to cut budgets for the arts in our public school system, I hope to affirm that if my students approach their craft with discipline and commitment, following the path of the arts can indeed be a tool towards supporting themselves.  
This summer, Truthworker Theatre Company will be working in partnership with JACK -a new performance space located in Clinton Hill. All workshops, rehearsals, and performances will be running out of JACK. Stay tuned for performance details! Projected date: Aug. 11th, 4pm (www.jackny.org)
Please consider supporting the hard work that Truthworker Theatre Company is deeply committed to. While our full budget for TTC far exceeds what we are asking for here, the amount we are hoping to raise through this campaign will allow us to operate for the four weeks. As we launch this summer, we hope that you can help us meet or exceed our financial goal of $8,000 so that we can bring our programatic visions to fruition.

Thank you so much for being a part of this important initiative!
 
                                  -----UPDATE-----
 

 
Truthworker Theatre Company launched programming on July 6th! 
Please help us reach our fundraising goal!
Within the first week, we grew each day both in numbers and as artists and quickly delved into the devising process. By the close of our first week, our 15 member company was already begging for more time to work together as they passionately began to develop an original work called:
BAR CODE: A Performative Analysis of the School to Prison Pipeline. 
The devotion of the company members has been remarkable. Each day, we have had 100% attendance with everyone showing up early and staying late--squeezing every second out of our time together. The young members of TTC have been stepping up to the plate in taking on all of the responsibilities of bringing their creative visions to fruition. From gathering statistics and compiling research, to staying up late in the studio mixing and mastering an audio score for their work, each facet of this process has been youth led and driven.
 

 
So many moments have occurred in our society during this short time that we have used as fodder, inspiration, education, and a call for further analysis, but non as poignant as the Zimmerman trial. The verdict landed pretty heavily in the hearts of our young people- stirring up a world of emotions, questions, fears, and demands. It is a great honor and a great challenge to uphold a safe space for learning, reflecting, mobilizing, and truth telling. While I feel so sad that this is the legacy our young one's have inherited, I am all the more charged with encouraging my students to use their art to broadcast the stories that go missing so that we can begin the process of collectively healing and transforming our future.
 

 
Truthworker Theatre Company has just completed three vibrant and productive weeks of rigorous programming! We are two weeks away from our final performance on August 11th!
BAR CODE: A Performative Analysis of the School to Prison Pipeline
We are so grateful to the guests who have blessed us with their stories and expertise as we strive to create work that reflects the narratives that so often go untold in our communities. As part of programming, I have been committed to bringing bi-weekely speakers and guest artists such as Malik Yoba, Climbing Poetree, and Nsangou Njikam to work with our youth. This last week, we were honored to welcome a powerful guest speaker, Zaki, who came to share with us about his experience with the Prison Industrial Complex as a formerly incarcerated youth who spent 16 years inside from the tender age of 16. He is now a powerful educator, activist, and mentor in the NYC schools, detention centers, and beyond. It was insightful, inspiring, informative and, most importantly, eye opening.

I am blown away by the continued generosity of my community far and wide! There are few things more invigorating than receiving the heartfelt support and faith that each of you has placed in my work and vision. At this point, we have 2 days left to surpass our Indiegogo Campaign goal. This is a modest goal for the amount of work and resources that a program like this calls for. Already, the company has requested props, costumes, and set designs that would bring their vision to fruition, not to mention food, water, transportation, and all of the unexpected day-to-day expenses and production costs that have arisen. Having said that, we hope to exceed $8,000 in the next 2 days so that not only can their final performance be as powerful as they envision it, but so that we can continue to do this work beyond the summer!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><span>This summer, we worked with a remarkable group of 10 students in Rabinal, Guatemala who have a profound vision for the future. In the words of 16 year old Lilian Bolvito:</span></p>
<p><em>""What I hope to achieve is to become a Doctor so that I can help others in my community to have good health. Today, I am working as hard as I can so that I can reach my goal, and also so that I can be example that anything in life is possible with effort and perseverence."" </em></p>

<p><strong>Hi! My name is</strong><strong> Maree Guenole </strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks for checking out my project.  </strong></p>
<p>I have an offer to attend Sotheby's Institute of Art London. I will study for a Master of Arts specialising in East Asian Art.</p>
<p>What's special about this? This is an object based programme allowing me the opportunity to handle and view the art I am studying first hand.</p>
<p>Why am I doing this? This is an unique opportunity for me to study with some of the world's most knowledgeable and experienced teachers in their field. There is nothing similar offered in my home country New Zealand.</p>
<p>How will I benefit? I am a passionate art aficianado, I paint, write and collect. I will become immersed in Asian Art esthetiques to fully appreciate the continent's art history and the market for the objects created there. I look forward to a career that will incorporate my passion for writing, hunting for treasure and allow me time in between to pursue my creativity.</p>
<p>What will my outcomes be? I will complete a Master's programme with one of the world's best institutes in its field and thereafter have the ability to identify and share with others what makes Asian Art so beautiful and the qualities that make it desirable. <strong>And I will pay 5% forward to another project in the future.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>I appreciate this chance to share with you my passion and excitement about my dream.</p>
<p>18, 335 km represents the distance from Auckland to Bloomsbury to undertake my MA. Could you please help me get there?</p>
<p>The objective of my project is to undertake professional development to grow my knowledge of East Asian Art forms and appreciation for these.</p>
<p>This is 14 months of study with a thesis requirement. This opportunity will give me the knowledge to understand and identify objects and art created in East Asia both historical and contemporary first hand because I will be able to handle the objects rather than look at them in a book or in slides. This is what sets the programme apart.</p>
<p>I am really excited to be going. I have been working on this project for 5 years and I am thrilled to be accepted to study under the direction of Dr Anne Farrer.</p>
<p>Apart from visiting art fairs, auction houses, galleries, and museums my class will also travel to China.</p>
<p>In the event this project does not proceed I will notify all backers and be moving to London later in the year to begin work on how I may approach the same programme of study from there rather than NZ with a view to applying for the next intake.</p>
<p>Please give me a boost to get there!</p></div>","Hi! My name is Maree Guenole

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Sol Studios Fairfax is a local Yoga / Movement / Music Studio that offers a variety of classes and styles practiced in both heated and non-heated environments. Our passion is enriching the lives of our friends and the community here in Fairfax -- not only with yoga; but also through monthly music and performance events, as well as holistic health presentations. Our classes cater to everyone -- from the beginner that's new to yoga to the more experienced yogis/yoginis.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ever since we officially opened our doors in June 2013, we've dreamed of creating a studio that is not only exceptional; but truly unique: A studio that is designed with you in mind -- classes tailored to your needs, a flexible schedule and a continuous flow of education and cultural enrichment. Yoga is evolving and we are on the cutting edge of this evolution. Through science and research, we are fusing east and west modalities for the modern day Yogini.<br/></p>
<p>We want to make Sol Studios Fairfax not only the best; but the most beautiful studio in Marin...all this while keeping our prices the lowest in the county.</p>
<p>But in order to achieve our goals, we need to make some significant investments: in the studio and through teacher education. This includes the following:  </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Purchasing yoga accessories: new mats, more props; </li>
<li>Adding more classes &amp; instructors; scholarship fund for children/elders,teacher education, free community classes and health talks.</li>
<li>Expanding the facilities to include a shower, chairs, improved acoustic treatment &amp; sound system, and a small retail / snack shop.. </li>
</ul>Since this is your community, we hope that you will help us make Sol Studios Fairfax the best it can be. <br/><p></p>

<p>And that’s all there is to it.</p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Short Summary
Sol Studios Fairfax is a local Yoga / Movement / Music Studio that offers a variety of classes and styles practiced in both heated and non-heated environments. Our passion is enriching the lives of our friends and the community here in Fairfax -- not only with yoga; but also through monthly music and performance events, as well as holistic health presentations. Our classes cater to everyone -- from the beginner that's new to yoga to the more experienced yogis/yoginis.

Ever since we officially opened our doors in June 2013, we've dreamed of creating a studio that is not only exceptional; but truly unique: A studio that is designed with you in mind -- classes tailored to your needs, a flexible schedule and a continuous flow of education and cultural enrichment. Yoga is evolving and we are on the cutting edge of this evolution. Through science and research, we are fusing east and west modalities for the modern day Yogini.
We want to make Sol Studios Fairfax not only the best; but the most beautiful studio in Marin...all this while keeping our prices the lowest in the county.
But in order to achieve our goals, we need to make some significant investments: in the studio and through teacher education. This includes the following:  


Purchasing yoga accessories: new mats, more props; 
Adding more classes & instructors; scholarship fund for children/elders,teacher education, free community classes and health talks.
Expanding the facilities to include a shower, chairs, improved acoustic treatment & sound system, and a small retail / snack shop.. 
Since this is your community, we hope that you will help us make Sol Studios Fairfax the best it can be. 
What We Need & What You Get



The estimated total cost to make these improvements is $21,000. We've already invested $8,000+ in improvements since we purchased the previous yoga business on site; the additional $21,000 will be used as follows ( a percentage of funds received is taken by indiegogo )

 Teacher education & scholarship fund 4,000 Mats - $500, Computer with barcode scanner - $1600, Back Jack Chairs -$900 , Folding Chairs $230, PA system $2000, Acoustic Panels $2900, Signage $500, Rugs $300, Props $2000, Outdoor tables $600, Repairs ( shower, electrical, heating ) $ 650, Painting $250, Desk $250, Curtains $ 300 , PR $500, Lighting $250, Retail setup,snacks refreshments, bottles,clothes,music $3000

<h3>We would like to thank all of you for your interest in our Group &amp; Campaign!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>As many of you know, we research Paranormal occurances mainly on the west coast and have done so for many years. Much like our more popular TV teams, we strive for answers, however we do not have the tv network funding to back us. As the technology gets improved and more expensive, it becomes harder for us to maintain an up-to-date equipment list without some kind of funding to do so. We have relied solely on our own income outside of our group, but as our followers and friends on social media become so massive, we feel we need to step up our game in order to show how much we care about those that follow and friend us on the social media side of our group!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are starting this campaign in order to get the funding required for us to get an internet based start in online sales in order to fund our project without any further donations from our fantastic followers and friends. These items will include Shirts and similar items that may be of interest to you as a funding partner. </p>
Many of our Contributors will be investing into some of our merchandise that they will receive as one of the perks for that contribution. We have a new Logo which is Biker Based, but elegant and will be printed on our shirts and other merchandise. Our founder is an avid rider of Harley's, Loves Rock Music and likes to go to strange places, thus the reason we like to go to Haunted Places.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Even if our goal isn't reached, the funding will go to exactly what we need to get started on our sales, equipment will come later if need be... Never the less, we will continue to try to bring our Personalities, Differences, Love and Passion for the Paranormal to you, our friends and family!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>By contributing to our campaign, we can continue to bring you our crazy, unorthodox, but serious Ghost/Paranormal Adventures as seen on our youtube channel. As you can see, we have Season 1 Episode 2 (Lassen Community Hospital) linked to this campaign, but our pilot episode  compared to the newest episode shows how much we have dedicated to this exploration of the unknown.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Although this campaign is asking for a cash donation, there are other ways you can help us. Spread the word by using the Share Buttons labeled on this page to share to your social media account. You can also donate equipment to us as well, like Rem-Pods, Flir Thermal Camera, by e-mailing us: <a href=""mailto:info@capsparanormal.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">info@capsparanormal.org</a>

<p>In many countries around the world there is no 911; there are no emergency medicine doctors. PLeDGE Health is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit striving to change that by engaging our volunteer health care professionals in global medicine development projects. We believe this model will build the skills of our volunteers while supporting the development of emergency health care delivery in countries that really need it.</p>
<p>Through our development model we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tackle projects where trainees are presented with global health challenges.</li>
<li>Transform our volunteers into better leaders, providers and people.</li>
<li>Design programs to support our global partners in achieving their goals. </li>
</ul><p>We are currently working with physicians, nurses and prehospital providers in Nepal and Zimbabwe to develop emergency medicine as a specialty.</p>
<h2><strong>PLeDGE Your Support</strong></h2>
<p>As a newly formed nonprofit we are fundraising for our initial capital. To date, we have formed and operated purely on volunteer efforts and $2000 in donations from our founding officers. As we are preparing for our first two inaugural training and education symposiums we need additional funding. Our goal of $20,000, while not covering the total operating expenses of the first year and running the two conferences, will assist us in leveraging funding. Money raised will help us fund:</p>
<ul>
<li>1st annual National Prehospital Medicine and Disaster Preparedness conference in Kathmandu, Nepal.</li>
<li>1st annual Zimbabwe Emergency Medical Society Training and Education Symposium.</li>
<li>Emergency Medicine Specialty Training Development in Zimbabwe.</li>
</ul><h2><strong>Every Dollar Counts. Every Donor Counts.</strong></h2>
<p>Even the smallest contribution brings us closer to improving emergency medicine globally. Every dollar is tax deductible. Your donation will be used to fund: </p>
<ul>
<li>Direct costs of conferences in Nepal &amp; Zimbabwe</li>
<li>Development of open source educational materials</li>
<li>Outreach and support of specialty development</li>

<p>We are raising the profile of emergency medical care in both Nepal and Zimbabwe. We have sponsored the formation of the Nepal Emergency Medicine Organization.

There are over 1,000 Black H'mong ethnic minority people living in and around Ma Cha village. Sapa Rooms supports the 120 children in the school from kindergarten to 5th grade. Our long term focus is to continue to support the Ma Cha school so these children are able to have a more comfortable environment in which to learn, grow and develop.  As we believe education is the key to breaking the cycle of poverty.</p>
<p style=""""><br/>Before Sapa Rooms support, most of these children had no shoes, many had no pants and they certainly had next to no school resources. Going to school in Winter for these children was and still is extremely difficult. Close your eyes and imagine for a moment what it must be like for these children to firstly walk up to 6km bare foot over rice fields to school each morning when the temperature in winter is often minus 5 degrees celsius. the children sit in cold cement class rooms with no heating while the wind whistles through the broken windows and doors.<br/><br/></p>

<p>My name is Christopher McFadden Jr. I was born, raised, and currently reside in West Philadelphia. I have always had a passion for education. In fact, my appreciation and vigorous focus on my own schooling blinded my ability to see the poor educational conditions that were ongoing in my community. Upon completing my Masters in Criminal Justice in 2009, I became a middle school Special Education Co-Teacher at Young Scholars Frederick Douglass School in North Philadelphia. The three years I spent working in that community was an eye opener. It taught me to appreciate the youth even more than I did and that appreciation gave me the motivation to bring change to my community. My current focus is community involvement; specifically to help young men focus on academic and social progress. I am a mentor at Overbrook High School. I mentor young men between ninth and twelfth grade. My mentoring includes social and academic after schools programs, those programs are MAN Up, Homework club, Reading Club, and Fitness Friday.</p>

<p><strong>Time: </strong>1pm - 4pm</p>
<p>The youth in Philadelphia encounter violence daily on their streets, and in their homes, schools, romantic relationships, and online. However, it is a mistake to see young people only as a problem to be solved. It is time to start seeing them as part of the solution to the crisis of violence in Philadelphia. With your donations, we will host the Philadelphia Youth Project Kick-Off, a community event that will invite community members, businesses, leaders and most importantly, Philadelphia’s youth, out to educate and inform them about educational, employment, and volunteer opportunities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Philadelphia Youth Project (PYP) will feature speakers and poets who emphasize the importance of non-violence and support the positive progression of the youth in Philadelphia. Along with the speakers and poets there will be companies and organizations that are specifically geared toward supporting the Philadelphia youth. The youth themselves will have the opportunity to sign up with the organizations and/or speak with the companies about volunteer work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you believe in the power of youth and support their progression, come to The Philadelphia Youth Project (PYP) Kick-Off. To achieve upward mobility in our community is not easy but it can be done. This is our opportunity to achieve upward mobility and change the route of the issues facing the youth.</p>

<strong><em><span>Busting Breast Cancer: 7 Simple Steps to protect our daughters from this unnecessary disease</span></em></strong><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span> </span></span>
</h2>
<h3><span>This i<strong>s the first book to offer women healthy, significant and inexpensive ways to help stop breast cancer before it can start.</strong></span></h3>
<p><span><strong>Please purchase the book today &amp; help me finish the manuscript  in the coming three months.   <br/></strong></span></p>
<p><span>The international research exists. Each woman who develops breast cancer carries her own unique cocktail of toxins and toxic assaults in her body.</span></p>
<p><span>U.S. breast cancer rates are climbing faster each year than ever before because most women don't know about these 7 Simple Steps that can help stop much of this unnecessary cancer.   </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why are U.S. Breast Cancer Rates Increasing?</h3>
<p>Our grandmothers and great grandmothers didn't get breast cancer in the huge numbers we are seeing today; a breast cancer germ did not recently   fall from the sky.</p>
<p>Instead, modern day lifestyle habits and products continue to affect women's bodies. causing invasive breast cancer rates to rise by 12 percent a year in younger women under 45,  and by 6 percent a year in women 65 &amp; older.</p>
<p>These increasing invasive breast cancer rates are unacceptable.   </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why hasn't this book been done before?</h3>
<p><strong>There are no big profits in natural prevention.</strong></p>
<p><span>Most medically trained folks in the U.S. can only make money once  women get sick. Pharmaceutical companies make more money when more women get sick and  successful cancer centers usually become more profitable when more women need their services. </span></p>
<p><span>Few medical professionals or institutions have the time to teach women inexpensive  lifestyle habits that will help us avoid getting that first  invasive breast cancer diagnosis.   </span></p>
<p>This means that women (and those who love us) are the only folks with the self -interest and the power to help stop breast cancer before it can start. </p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h3><span>What are some of these research-based steps found in <em>Busting Breast Cancer?</em><br/></span></h3>
<ul>
<li><span>Raise your Vitamin D3 blood level to 50-80 ng/ml using <em><strong>safe</strong></em> tanning and Vitamin D3 supplement. KNOW your vitamin D3 number!!!!</span></li>
<li><span>Avoid birth control drugs &amp; try a hormone-free IUD or have a tubal ligation instead. </span></li>
<li><span>Eat at least 7 cancer-blocking foods and supplements each day. </span></li>

<h2>Did you know?</h2>
<h3>Very few breast cancer foundations support natural prevention projects</h3>

<p> </p></div>","Busting Breast Cancer: 7 Simple Steps to protect our daughters from this unnecessary disease 

This is the first book to offer women healthy, significant and inexpensive ways to help stop breast cancer before it can start.
Please purchase the book today & help me finish the manuscript  in the coming three months.   
The international research exists. Each woman who develops breast cancer carries her own unique cocktail of toxins and toxic assaults in her body.
U.S. breast cancer rates are climbing faster each year than ever before because most women don't know about these 7 Simple Steps that can help stop much of this unnecessary cancer.   
 
Why are U.S. Breast Cancer Rates Increasing?
Our grandmothers and great grandmothers didn't get breast cancer in the huge numbers we are seeing today; a breast cancer germ did not recently   fall from the sky.
Instead, modern day lifestyle habits and products continue to affect women's bodies. causing invasive breast cancer rates to rise by 12 percent a year in younger women under 45,  and by 6 percent a year in women 65 & older.
These increasing invasive breast cancer rates are unacceptable.   
 
Why hasn't this book been done before?
There are no big profits in natural prevention.
Most medically trained folks in the U.S. can only make money once  women get sick. Pharmaceutical companies make more money when more women get sick and  successful cancer centers usually become more profitable when more women need their services. 
Few medical professionals or institutions have the time to teach women inexpensive  lifestyle habits that will help us avoid getting that first  invasive breast cancer diagnosis.   
This means that women (and those who love us) are the only folks with the self -interest and the power to help stop breast cancer before it can start. 
 
What are some of these research-based steps found in Busting Breast Cancer?

Raise your Vitamin D3 blood level to 50-80 ng/ml using safe tanning and Vitamin D3 supplement. KNOW your vitamin D3 number!!!!
Avoid birth control drugs & try a hormone-free IUD or have a tubal ligation instead. 
Eat at least 7 cancer-blocking foods and supplements each day. 
 
Do any doctors support Busting Breast Cancer's 7 Simple Steps?

I learned about your new organization and forthcoming book on breast cancer. Please let me know how I can help you make this project successful.

This is a Win-Win Project
Proceeds from Busting Breast Cancer book sales will be used to fund Busting Breast Cancer, a non-profit educational organization and Embracing the World charities, as we help millions more women in the U.S. and around the world learn inexpensive and significant ways to  help stop breast cancer before it can start. 
Please participate in this Indiegogo Campaign now. By purchasing one or more copies of Busting Breast Cancer today,  you will  give me the needed funds to complete the book in the next twelve weeks. I cannot do this without your help today. Together we will complete this book and save lives as we teach women 7 Simple Steps to help protect ourselves from this unecessary disease.

<h3>Dear friends &amp; family, near and far:</h3>After studying with a small music school in rural Brazil last spring, I promised the school's directors that I would use my privilege and all of the resources the U.S. has to offer to help raise funds for them to buy air conditioning for the school's classrooms! Help me help them, by donating to this fundraiser! Just click ""FUND THIS PROJECT"" above to donate in less than 5 minutes.<br/><br/>I know you are probably sick of getting asked to donate money to various groups. This fundraiser, however, is different, for 2 main reasons:<br/><br/>1) the money does not go through a third party NGO or institution -- it goes straight from our hands to the hands of the school's directors in Iguatu.<br/>2) the money will be helping fulfill a need that the students of the school themselves identified! Air conditioning is not something I THINK the school needs -- it is a need students and staff expressed directly to me.<br/><br/>If you have questions, please contact me personally or email me at: emnewton@pugetsound.edu. See below for the story of my involvement with the school.<br/><br/>I would really appreciate your help in this. The money will mean so much to the Escola de Musica and to my friends in Iguatu.<br/><br/>Peace &amp; love,<br/>Elizabeth<br/><h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Background<br/>
</h3>
<p>As most of you know, this last spring I studied abroad for 4 months in Brazil. The final month of this was an independent research project on a topic of my choosing. How did I decide what to do, you ask?<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>One Sunday morning I was reading the local newspaper. My Portuguese was broken (at best), but I nonetheless was able to get through most of the major news articles. One in particular caught my eye, and I read on. The article was covering the Escola de <em>Música Popular Humberto Teixeira (Humberto Teixeira School of Popular Music), a</em> newly built music school in the interior, or rural, part of the state I was living in, in a small city called Iguatu. It was a popular-music school funded by the government, which offered free music lessons to anyone who wanted them. Already, it had 400 students, and a wait-list of dozens. I was intrigued. After speaking with my academic director, she contacted the director of the school, and within days I was set to do my independent study with the school.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>For all of May 2010, I lived in Iguatu, a city of 100,000 people, and spent every day working at the Escola de <em>Música.</em> I sat in on classes, got know the students and teachers, and took a few music lessons myself! (Who knew I would be so terrible at playing the accordion?) I also got to know members of the Iguatu community and was welcomed with open arms by everyone I met.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p> <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">As I worked at the school, I was impressed by the successes of the school in just a few short months of operation. With support from the community, over 400 kids and adults in Iguatu now have access to music education. This has helped keep kids off of the streets and has given them a place to feel like they belong. </span>It has also helped to preserve important cultural traditions in Iguatu that are currently being eroded by Western influence.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>All this said, the school still struggles financially, with only limited funding from the government. The facilities are very nice, but very simple, with only 1 CD player that teachers must share between 8 classrooms. There is not enough money to buy instruments for students to rent, so students cannot practice at home.<br/></p>
<p><em> <span style=""font-style: italic;""></span><br/></em></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Main Need: Air Conditioning!<br/>
</h3>
<p>Iguatu is one of the hottest cities in Brazil. It is located in the dry, ""sertao"" (desert) region of Brazil, which gets extremely little rainfall and frequently experiences drought. Every day of the year, it is at least 90 degrees F outside with 70-80% humidity.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Most buildings and homes do not have air conditioning, simply because it is not financially feasible. In the School of Music, the main office had air conditioning, but no other classrooms did. The classes had only small ceiling fans that hardly did any good at all.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>As a result, during music classes, students would take breaks at least every 15 minutes or so to drink water and cool off. This was very distracting and at times unproductive.<br/></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">When I asked students and staff individually what the main need of the school is, they each replied, without exception, ""Air conditioning!!""</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>At the end of my time in Iguatu, I promised the staff at the school that I would use the extreme wealth of the United States to help the school. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Here in the US we routinely take a comfortable climate, heating &amp; A/C, and easy access to appropriate clothing for granted. If we are ever in a building in the winter without heating, or our school's air conditioning suddenly stopped working in late August, we would immediately complain and demand that something be done. <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">In Iguatu, students deal with this heat every day -- and no, they never ""get used to it.""</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need<br/>
</h3>
<p>US$600 will buy 1 air conditioner for the school. I would ideally like to give them more money, but I am trying to be realistic. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>1 air conditioner will make a big difference at the school. It will make the school day more comfortable, and encourage more students to continue attending the school, thus building community and diverting kids from engaging in less productive activities like drugs and violence.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Perhaps more importantly, our gift to the kids of Iguatu will be a valuable step toward cultural cooperation and a symbol of our support of their school. I know that most of you recognize the importance of music education. It is not, however, just important in the US -- it is important everywhere!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I know the directors are not expecting me to keep my promise. Unfortunately, individuals in developing countries are often used to plans falling through and donor groups failing to deliver. Think about how powerful it will be when the students at the Escola de Musica realize that dozens of US citizens were thinking just about them!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Your donation, in any amount, will help so much! 100% of funds donated, minus fees necessary for wiring the money to my contacts in Iguatu, will be wired DIRECTLY to the school to be used by the directors of the school themselves. <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">There is no third party.</span> You can feel confident in donating to this fundraiser that your money will have direct impact on the lives of those I met in Iguatu. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>How to Help<br/>
</h3>
<p>Donate whatever amount you can! Think about what you spend money on every week. Coffee, beer, sandwiches, gas, expensive shampoo, and much, much more! I'm not trying to guilt trip you -- just trying to encourage you to to divert a small amount of this spending each week into this fundraiser. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Donating is so</span> easy. Like, it could seriously not be any easier. You don't even have to register. Just hit ""FUND THIS PROJECT"" above, enter your credit card information, and you're done.<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> Within 3 minutes!!!</span> The website is secure and safe (I have used it before and have donated myself to other fundraisers.)<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>I am not naive in thinking that buying an air conditioning unit or two will solve the multitude of social problems that affect our world. I know, however, that this is a small, easy thing we can all do together to help make a school doing great things do even more good.<br/>

A touring exhibition about Women’s Football in East London that will tour across East London throughout March and the months after, with an exhibition launch event (£1200 cost for designing and printing the exhibition and to help fund the launch)
Deliver a programme of youth workshops across East London in March aimed at empowering young girls to explore history and football in community centres (£400 for costs, materials and resources)
Run community workshops to promote women’s history and the impact the women of East London have had on Football (£400 for costs, materials and resources)
 The Impact This project will celebrate the history of East London women and the contributions they have made in football. Women continue to face discrimination in football and we want to address this head on. We want to empower young girls to explore their own heritage and take ownership of playing football.  With this exhibition we not only want to uncover the history of Women’s football, but celebrate it too. Risk and Challenges We have a tight deadline and a small budget to make this project a reality if we are to deliver this project by Women’s History Month in March 2017. We need to:
Design and print the exhibition
Organise venues and make arrangements for refreshments
Develop workshop materials that will empower young girls to play football.

They posted pictures from their two visits on <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.216339841712212.63326.118818978130966#%21/UbushoboziProject"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Facebook"">Facebook</a> and shared stories of courageous young women triumphing over violence and poverty. <br/><br/>From Ubushobozi's website: <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Ubushobozi Project is a non-profit organization started by Jeanne Siporin, Alan Siporin and Laura Boyea in September 2008... Through education and skills training Ubushobozi seeks to end the cycle of poverty they have experienced throughout their young lives. </span><br style=""font-style: italic;""/><br style=""font-style: italic;""/><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Through the generosity of our dedicated donors, Ubushobozi provides each student with a sewing machine (which they then own), sewing lessons, fabric and an outlet for selling their creations. In addition, they are provided with a weekly stipend, nutritious meals (of their choosing) and English, mathematics, computers and basic life skills. Health issues are addressed through routine HIV testing and all girls are provided with medical insurance to seek quality, professional care.</span><span style=""font-style: italic;""></span><br style=""font-style: italic;""/><br style=""font-style: italic;""/><span style=""font-style: italic;"">The participants are accepted into Ubushobozi by peer recommendation and approval by the all project members, staff and advisers based on these criteria: unable to attend school due to lack of fees, orphaned or head of household, at risk due to poverty. 100% of Ubushobozi’s participants reside in dwellings with no electricity or running water. Through the Ubushobozi Project they are able to purchase candles or lanterns and clean water on a steady basis.</span><br/><br/>The project just welcomed its ninth student, 15-year-old Margaret and her 5-month-old baby, Eric. Are you crying yet? <br/><br/><h2>My Story<br/>
</h2>Last June, Betsy, Dolinda, and some New York-based volunteers held an Ubushobozi fundraiser at a restaurant in Brooklyn. Ubushobozi bags were available for sale (I bought several, despite being recently unemployed), and prizes were raffled; it was a blast. At the end of the evening, one of the volunteers announced that the fundraiser, a bunch of middle-class New Yorkers kicking in a $20 suggested donation and drinking beer, raised enough money to bring another girl into the project. Just a few thousand dollars--a couple of months’ rent in New York City--was going to change the life of another girl living in poverty. I was blown away (and crying in my seltzer). <br/><br/>Since then, the money from the fundraiser, plus private donations have enabled the project to start a vegetable garden and buy chickens, purchase national health insurance for each student, staff member, and their immediate families and household members, AND allow another student into the project. Ubushobozi has gone from two students and one volunteer in 2008 to nine students and eight full-time Rwandan staff members in just three years.<br/><br/>In November 2010, I signed up to sell some of my handicrafts at an eco-fair in Long Island City to supplement my freelance editor’s income. A couple of weeks before the show I was scrambling for stock when I had a brilliant idea. I should sell Ubushobozi bags too! Those girls had been haunting me since the fundraiser. Plus, I always got so many compliments on my bag; I knew they would be the hit of the fair. <br/><br/>Betsy was thrilled with the idea. We met at my favorite lunch spot, where she gave me the bags and I made a confession. “I’ve been stalking you and Dlo and the girls on Facebook for like a year.”<br/><br/>“Before you know it, you’ll be going to Rwanda to teach the girls to crochet,” she said.<br/><br/>I almost burst into tears. Or maybe I did.<br/><br/>“I could do that?”<br/><br/>“They would LOVE it!” she insisted. I was stunned, and those words imprinted on my brain.<br/><br/>Shoppers at the craft fair purchased nearly all of the bags in just a few short hours. People loved hearing about the girls and knowing that the money would go directly into the project. The whole time I kept thinking, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Can I do this? Can I go to Rwanda? Yes, I can go to Rwanda.</span><br/><br/>Betsy and I saw each other a few weeks later. “I can’t stop thinking about what you said. Who do I need to speak to about making this happen?"" I asked.<br/><br/>“Our volunteer coordinator,” she deadpanned. <br/><br/>“Super. Can you put us in touch?"" <br/><br/>""Sure."" She looked like she might burst. ""It's me.""<br/><br/>So here we are, and I’m going to Rwanda. My whole life, I’ve secretly wanted to join the Peace Corp, but I figured an actor/writer/crafter/vegetarian blogger wouldn’t be much help setting up irrigation systems or fighting malaria outbreaks. While that may be true, it turns out I have something to offer the girls of Ubushobozi Project. <br/><br/><h2>Craftstory</h2>According to Betsy, the Ubushobozi girls want to learn EVERYTHING. So, I intend to teach them everything I know: food and crafts.<br/><br/>Nutrition: Meat is expensive and scarce in Rwanda. The girls eat a mostly starch-based diet of potatoes, rice, and sorghum with fresh vegetables from their home gardens. I’ll be using my years of frugal vegetarian cooking and eating (!) experience to show them how to get the most nutrition from what’s available.<br/><br/>Knit and crochet: Ruhengeri and Gashingiro are in the mountain region of Rwanda. The nip in the evening air warrants cool weather wear like scarves, hats, and sweaters, so knitting and crocheting will be handy skills for the girls to have. Crochet bags and dish clothes can also be useful additions to the current Ubushobozi sales offering. <br/><br/>Embroidery: The girls are pros at machine sewing and make beautiful garments and accessories. With basic hand embroidery skills, like back stitch, chain stitch, and the French knot, they can start to embellish their clothes and accessories and perhaps create art to sell, as well. <br/><br/>One of the girls has an injury that prevents her from operating the 
sewing machine's foot pedals. Learning these hand crafts will be 
invaluable skills for her. We’ll also dabble in the stencil arts, courtesy of graphic design star <a href=""http://www.stencil1.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Ed Roth"">Ed Roth</a>. <br/><br/><h2>Your Story<br/>
</h2>I need about $3,000 to go to Rwanda. Until two weeks ago, I was a semi-employed writer/editor trying to save for this trip, but mostly just getting by like everyone else. Now that I have a full-time job, the savings is slowly starting to rebound, but not quickly enough to keep the Rwanda plan in motion. <br/><br/>Your contributions will provide me with round-trip airfare from New York-JFK to Kigali, Rwanda (approximately $2,600), plus minor but necessary expenses during my 10-day volunteer commitment in late July-early August. I’ll be staying at the Ubushobozi Project’s house, so my only lodging costs will be purchasing a mattress ($80) from the local market. The rest of the money raised (roughly $300) will go to purchasing craft supplies, like knitting needles, crochet hooks, embroidery needles, yarn, floss, fabric, and paint for the girls.

They posted pictures from their two visits on Facebook and shared stories of courageous young women triumphing over violence and poverty. From Ubushobozi's website: Ubushobozi Project is a non-profit organization started by Jeanne Siporin, Alan Siporin and Laura Boyea in September 2008... Through education and skills training Ubushobozi seeks to end the cycle of poverty they have experienced throughout their young lives. Through the generosity of our dedicated donors, Ubushobozi provides each student with a sewing machine (which they then own), sewing lessons, fabric and an outlet for selling their creations. In addition, they are provided with a weekly stipend, nutritious meals (of their choosing) and English, mathematics, computers and basic life skills. Health issues are addressed through routine HIV testing and all girls are provided with medical insurance to seek quality, professional care.The participants are accepted into Ubushobozi by peer recommendation and approval by the all project members, staff and advisers based on these criteria: unable to attend school due to lack of fees, orphaned or head of household, at risk due to poverty. 100% of Ubushobozi’s participants reside in dwellings with no electricity or running water. Through the Ubushobozi Project they are able to purchase candles or lanterns and clean water on a steady basis.The project just welcomed its ninth student, 15-year-old Margaret and her 5-month-old baby, Eric. Are you crying yet? My Story
Last June, Betsy, Dolinda, and some New York-based volunteers held an Ubushobozi fundraiser at a restaurant in Brooklyn. Ubushobozi bags were available for sale (I bought several, despite being recently unemployed), and prizes were raffled; it was a blast. At the end of the evening, one of the volunteers announced that the fundraiser, a bunch of middle-class New Yorkers kicking in a $20 suggested donation and drinking beer, raised enough money to bring another girl into the project. Just a few thousand dollars--a couple of months’ rent in New York City--was going to change the life of another girl living in poverty. I was blown away (and crying in my seltzer). Since then, the money from the fundraiser, plus private donations have enabled the project to start a vegetable garden and buy chickens, purchase national health insurance for each student, staff member, and their immediate families and household members, AND allow another student into the project. Ubushobozi has gone from two students and one volunteer in 2008 to nine students and eight full-time Rwandan staff members in just three years.In November 2010, I signed up to sell some of my handicrafts at an eco-fair in Long Island City to supplement my freelance editor’s income. A couple of weeks before the show I was scrambling for stock when I had a brilliant idea. I should sell Ubushobozi bags too! Those girls had been haunting me since the fundraiser. Plus, I always got so many compliments on my bag; I knew they would be the hit of the fair. Betsy was thrilled with the idea. We met at my favorite lunch spot, where she gave me the bags and I made a confession. “I’ve been stalking you and Dlo and the girls on Facebook for like a year.”“Before you know it, you’ll be going to Rwanda to teach the girls to crochet,” she said.I almost burst into tears. Or maybe I did.“I could do that?”“They would LOVE it!” she insisted. I was stunned, and those words imprinted on my brain.Shoppers at the craft fair purchased nearly all of the bags in just a few short hours. People loved hearing about the girls and knowing that the money would go directly into the project. The whole time I kept thinking, Can I do this? Can I go to Rwanda? Yes, I can go to Rwanda.Betsy and I saw each other a few weeks later. “I can’t stop thinking about what you said. Who do I need to speak to about making this happen?"" I asked.“Our volunteer coordinator,” she deadpanned. “Super. Can you put us in touch?"" ""Sure."" She looked like she might burst. ""It's me.""So here we are, and I’m going to Rwanda. My whole life, I’ve secretly wanted to join the Peace Corp, but I figured an actor/writer/crafter/vegetarian blogger wouldn’t be much help setting up irrigation systems or fighting malaria outbreaks. While that may be true, it turns out I have something to offer the girls of Ubushobozi Project. CraftstoryAccording to Betsy, the Ubushobozi girls want to learn EVERYTHING. So, I intend to teach them everything I know: food and crafts.Nutrition: Meat is expensive and scarce in Rwanda. The girls eat a mostly starch-based diet of potatoes, rice, and sorghum with fresh vegetables from their home gardens. I’ll be using my years of frugal vegetarian cooking and eating (!) experience to show them how to get the most nutrition from what’s available.Knit and crochet: Ruhengeri and Gashingiro are in the mountain region of Rwanda. The nip in the evening air warrants cool weather wear like scarves, hats, and sweaters, so knitting and crocheting will be handy skills for the girls to have. Crochet bags and dish clothes can also be useful additions to the current Ubushobozi sales offering. Embroidery: The girls are pros at machine sewing and make beautiful garments and accessories. With basic hand embroidery skills, like back stitch, chain stitch, and the French knot, they can start to embellish their clothes and accessories and perhaps create art to sell, as well. One of the girls has an injury that prevents her from operating the 
sewing machine's foot pedals. Learning these hand crafts will be 
invaluable skills for her. We’ll also dabble in the stencil arts, courtesy of graphic design star Ed Roth. Your Story
I need about $3,000 to go to Rwanda. Until two weeks ago, I was a semi-employed writer/editor trying to save for this trip, but mostly just getting by like everyone else. Now that I have a full-time job, the savings is slowly starting to rebound, but not quickly enough to keep the Rwanda plan in motion. Your contributions will provide me with round-trip airfare from New York-JFK to Kigali, Rwanda (approximately $2,600), plus minor but necessary expenses during my 10-day volunteer commitment in late July-early August. I’ll be staying at the Ubushobozi Project’s house, so my only lodging costs will be purchasing a mattress ($80) from the local market. The rest of the money raised (roughly $300) will go to purchasing craft supplies, like knitting needles, crochet hooks, embroidery needles, yarn, floss, fabric, and paint for the girls. I am working on corporate donations for supplies and have a call out to knit and crochet designers for an exclusive Ubushobozi bag the girls can sell. Any money raised that is not spent on supplies will be donated to directly to the Ubushobozi Project for the girls’ benefit.

<h3>Who I Am &amp; What I'm Doing</h3>
<p>My name is Danielle Renae Kathryn Then and I am a 21-year-old college student from Guernsey Wyoming. As promised, here is the Google Maps link so you can see where I grew up:</p>
<p><a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Guernsey,+WY&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=42.269691,-104.741631&amp;sspn=0.061608,0.132351&amp;oq=guernsey&amp;hnear=Guernsey,+Platte,+Wyoming&amp;t=m&amp;z=13&amp;source=gplus-ogsb"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Guernsey,+WY&amp;amp...</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>It doesn't look like it, but I promise there is civilization. You just have to zoom in.</p>
<p>I was raised by a single parent and I have paid for college by myself up to this point. My father would give me the would if he could, but even the tuition in Wyoming was too much for him to assist me with. </p>
<p>I recently moved to Los Angeles to attend USC, which, for me, is a dream come true. When I was in Wyoming I didn't have access to the resources I needed to become a psychologist. Now that I am here, everything I need is at my fingertips. This is, of course, at the cost of just under $30,000 a semester. Everything that I cannot cover with need-based and performance-based financial aid has been taken out in student loans, which are piling high at this point. </p>
<p>This semester, I was accepted into the East Asian Studies Center's Global East Asia progam in Shanghai. The program is insanely competitive, and with good reason. The opportunity I have been afforded to study culture and social interaction is priceless. In this case it does have a pricetag, however. Including my plane ticket from Denver to LAX, I'll be spending a little over $6,000. There are no institutional student loans for me, as the class is only 4 credit hours, and the minimum requirement for summer financial aid is 6 credit hours. That's where you come in... </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>Roughly $500 to pay for my plane ticket from Denver to Los Angeles to begin the program in May. </p>
<p><span>4 credit hours summer tuition, at $1,473 per unit, which comes to $5,892 total. </span></p>
<p><span>That's it.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>1. My eternal gratitude. In this case, my gratitude will be expressed in the form of a postcard from China with an original poem.</p>
<p>2. Anyone who donates more than $20 gets a handmade keychain. A woman who is very important to me offered her help in this campaign and will be making panda-shaped keychains to raise funds. They will be infused with love, I assure you. </p>
<p><span>3. For donations more than $200, I have decided to compensate you with something that is very important to me; a panda. I have been collecting them since I was young and each has its own name and uique story, which will be written up and shipped along with the panda. My only request is that you take care of them! Each one is a small piece of my life story. </span></p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I could spend five hours a day for the rest of my life reading about studies on cultural difference, and never really learn how to be an effective psychologist. Anyone in the mental health/medical field knows that experience is everything. By helping me go to China, you are helping me become the best I can be, so that I can help others as effectively as possible. </p>

	De los 4 a los 7 años, los niños se encuentran en la etapa pre-operacional, enfrentando lo que es probablemente el más grande reto de su desarrollo cognitivo: la transición de entender el mundo a través de sus sentidos (llamado pensamiento concreto) a representar la realidad mediante símbolos, conceptos y modelos (llamado pensamiento abstracto). A esta edad los niños requieren el uso de elementos tangibles para ser capaces de procesas información y constantemente probar sus ideas..</p>

	Con Tullpi, tu hijo aprende a contar, sumar, restar, qué son las unidades, decenas, centenas, cómo hallar el doble y la mitad, ¡Gana estrellas y conquista planetas! En resumen, todo lo que los niños tienen que aprender en el primer año del colegio, pero ¡de manera divertida!

	En colegios donde no pueden permitirse el comprar el material convencional usado para aprender matemáticas (porque es costoso), les piden a los padres coleccionar tapitas de botella. Esta es una genial solución, las tapas de botella son fáciles de manipular y vienen en diferentes colores.

	El reflector tiene dentro un pequeño espejo inclinado que se coloca encima de la cámara frontal de la Tablet (como se muestra abajo). De esta forma, la cámara capturará el área de la mesa que está justo en frente de la Tablet, detectando así la posición y color de las tapitas de botella.</p>

	Somos de Perú y nuestro país ocupó el último lugar de educación matemática, tal como se muestra en el gráfico siguiente. Es por eso que sentimos que algo debía hacerse. 
</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457750667/plwuvfrtamuxq6v35yqg.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 580px;""/></p>
<p>
	Pero lo triste acerca de estos resultados es que están fuertemente atados al nivel socioeconómico, lo que significa que hay una gran brecha entre la calidad de educación que unos cuantos recibe y la deficiencia o inexistente educación que el resto recibe. Este escenario está también presente en varios otros países, sobretodo en Latinoamérica.

	Alrededor del mundo, existen diversas iniciativas, tales como <a href=""http://learning.xprize.org/about/overview"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Xprize Global Learning Challenge</a> o <a href=""http://www.curiouslearning.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Curious Learning</a>, que buscan llevar tablets, con contenido educativo, que permitan a los niños de zonas vulnerables y rurales lograr los niveles básicos de literatura y aritmética. Gracias al precio decreciente de las tablets, creemos que es  una oportunidad para crear un impacto real.

<h3>¿Qué es Maba?</h3>
<p>
	Maba es una iniciativa educativa sin fines de lucro, que en asociación con Curious Learning (Global Literacy Project), busca mejorar los niveles de aprendizaje de matemáticas y ciencias en los colegios más vulnerables del país a través de la donación de tablets, la implementación de una conexión a internet veloz y el acceso irrestricto a un sin número de contenidos educativos digitales.

	Durante nuestras primeras entrevistas con padres y profesores, descubrimos que las mejores prácticas en matemática tienen un rasgo en común: la transformación de objetos simples (como alimentos, carros de juguete…) o actividades cotidianas (como el almuerzo, la compra de los alimentos…) en espacios ricos de aprendizaje. Esto, combinado con las preguntas adecuadas y paciencia dan los mejores resultados.

<p><b>Preguntas frecuentes</b></p>
<p>- ¿Si se me pierde una tapita, cómo la reemplazo?</p>
<p>Tullpi funciona con cualquier tapita de botella de plástico de tamaño regular (30mm), es por eso que puedes reemplazar estas tapitas con alguna otra que encuentres en casa y decidas reciclar. ¡No hay problema!</p>
<p>- ¿Para qué sirve el tablero en el kit donado?</p>
<p>Las tablets que son donadas, a los colegios públicos dentro de Maba, tienen la cámara en una esquina y no en el centro, como el iPad, es por ello que para jugar es necesario delimitar campo de juego y así se les haga más fácil a los niños saber dónde pueden poner la tapita y hacer que el  juego funcione de la forma adecuada.</p>
<p>- ¿En qué idiomas está la aplicación?</p>
<p>La aplicación está desarrollada en español e inglés. </p>
<p>- ¿Funciona para Android?</p>
<p>La aplicación de Tullpi ha sido desarrollada para sistema operativo Android y iOs. Sin embargo, nuestro juego cuenta además con un kit físico, en esta primera producción éste ha sido diseñado para el iPad. Nuestro próximo diseño será para una Tablet Android, y junto a la comunidad de esta campaña decidiremos para cuál lo haremos.</p>
<p>- ¿Para qué iPads funciona?</p>
<p>Actualmente Tullpi funciona con el iPad 2, 3, 4, iPad air 1, 2, iPad mini 2, 4.</p>
<p>- ¿Por qué tapitas?</p>
<p>En colegios donde no pueden permitirse el comprar el material convencional usado para aprender matemáticas (porque es costoso), les piden a los padres coleccionar tapitas de botella, lo cual es una solución genial, las tapas de botella son fáciles de manipular y vienen en diferentes colores, lo cual se aprovecha para identificar cada color con un concepto distinto, así las tapas azules se asocian a las unidades, las rojas a las decenas y las verdes a las centenas.</p>
<p>- ¿Qué juegos tendrá Tullpi?</p>
<p>Tullpi viene con nuestro primer juego FIRST, una colección de juegos educativos de matemática, éste contiene 6 juegos que desarrollan el contenido que un niño aprende en su primer año de educación escolar: Contar, Sumas 1, Sumas 2, Restas, Sistema numérico, Doble y Mitad.</p>
<p>En este tiempo de desarrollo lo que aprendimos fue que absolutamente todo debe ser diseñado en base a lo que el usuario quiere y requiere, así que el desarrollo de nuestros nuevos juegos será en base a lo que ustedes, nuestros primeros usuarios, nos digan que quieren o necesitan.</p>
<p>- ¿Sólo se puede jugar con tapitas?</p>
<p>Nuestro primer juego, FIRST, está diseñado para que funcione solo con tapitas, sin embargo seguiremos creando nuevos juegos y éstos podrían funcionar con elementos que pueden sorprendernos incluso a nosotros.</p>
<p>- ¿Quién dona las tablets?</p>
<p>Para jugar Tullpi es necesario tener una Tablet, entonces es necesario que los colegios públicos a los que donamos Tullpi cuenten con tablets para usar en clase. Por ello, nosotros trabajamos en conjunto con el Proyecto Maba (<a href=""http://www.proyectomaba.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.proyectomaba.org</a>), nuestro aliado estratégico, ellos implementan el uso de tablets como recurso para el aprendizaje en colegios de zonas vulnerables/rurales de Perú y nosotros donamos los kits para jugar Tullpi.</p>

<p>
	We created Tullpi because we see children frustrated with the conventional ways of learning math. 
</p>
<p>
	Tullpi transforms math into a constant experiment, creating an intuitive connection between abstract numbers and objects in the real world. Children use simple bottle caps to solve mathematical challenges with their own hands.
</p>
<p>
	Tullpi offers you a kit that transforms your iPad into a play/learn station. And for each kit purchased, we implement one in a public school in a vulnerable area.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	From the ages of 4 to 7, children are facing what is most likely the biggest challenge of their cognitive development: the transition from understanding the world through their senses (called concrete thinking) to represent reality through symbols, concepts and models (called abstract thinking). At this stage children require the use of tangible elements to be able to process information and constantly test their ideas.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457581789/eqrhzagvizhgynmskpn9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
	That is why the best education programs around the world focus on the use of tangible elements to help children to overcome this challenge. 
</p>
<p>
	We took it to another level.
</p>
<p>
	Tullpi creates a bridge between the world the child naturally understands and these new challenging concepts. 
</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p>
	With Tullpi, your child learns to count, sum, subtract, what are units, tens, hundreds, to find the double and a half, while he/she wins stars and conquers planets. In summary, everything kids have to learn in the first year of school, but making it fun!

<p>
	In schools where they could not afford to buy the conventional equipment used for math education (because they are kind of expensive), they asked parents to collect bottle caps. It is a great solution because bottle caps are easy to manipulate, they have different colors.

	The reflector has a small inclined mirror inside, that should be placed on the tablet (as shown below). This way, the frontal camera will capture the area of the table in front of the tablet, detecting the position and color of the bottle caps.

	We are from Peru and our country ranks last in math education, as shown in the graph below. This is why we felt something had to be done. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457750533/dta868691hqyh1168dpz.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 580px;""/></p>
<p>
	But the sad thing about this result is it is strongly tied to the socioeconomic class, which means that there is a huge gap between the quality of the education a few people can get and the deficient or inexistent education that the rest receive. 
</p>
<p>
This scenario is present in many other countries, especially in Latin-america.

<h3>What is Maba?</h3>
<p>
	Maba Project is a non for profit initiative that has partnered with Curious Learning (Global Literacy Project) with the intention of improving math and science  levels in the most vulnerable schools in Peru.  They implement tablets, a connection to fast internet, give access to countless digital educational content and train teachers.

<p>
	They started last year with seven schools achieving extraordinary results (an increase up to 12% percent in math competences). These results have accelerated their growth, causing them to expand to 14 schools this year.</p>
<h3>The challenge</h3>
<p>
	Tullpi will be implemented in their 7 initial schools, for all the kids in the first year of primary school. That is around 700 kids!   This is just our first challenge. And for this we need your help!</p>

	In our early interviews with parents and teachers, we found that the best practices in math had a common trait: transforming simple objects (such as food, car toys or so) or everyday activities (buying groceries, cleaning the house, etc.) into rich learning spaces. This combined with asking the right questions and patience gave them the best results.

<p>Tullpi works with any plastic bottle cap of regular size (30 mm), which is why you can replace these caps with some other you find at home and decide to recycle. No problem!</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">- What is the board in the kit donated?</span></p>
<p>The tablets that are donated to public schools (part of Maba), have the camera in a corner and not in the center, like the iPad, which is why is necessary to define the play field and in that way make easier for children to know where they can put the cap and make the game to function properly.</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">-What languages is the application?</span></p>

<p>In schools where they cannot afford to buy the conventional material used to learn math (because it is quite expensive), ask parents to collect bottle caps, which is an awesome solution, bottle caps are easy to handle and come in different colors!, which is used to identify each color with a different concept, and blue caps are associated with the units, the red ones with tens and green ones to the hundreds.</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">- What games does Tullpi have?</span></p>
<p>Tullpi comes with our FIRST game, a collection of 6 educational math games which develop the content that children learn in their first year of school: Counting, Sumas 1 Sumas 2 Subtraction, Number System, Double and Half.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time of creation what we learned is that absolutely everything must be designed based on what the user wants and needs, so the development of our new games will be based on what you, our first users, tell us you would love to play.</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">- You can only play with bottle caps?</span></p>
<p>Our first game, FIRST, is designed to work only with caps, however continue to create new games and they could work with elements that can surprise even us.</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">- Who bring the tablets to schools?</span></p>
<p>To play Tullpi you need a tablet, then it is necessary that public schools that have donated Tullpi with tablets for use in class.

	De los 4 a los 7 años, los niños se encuentran en la etapa pre-operacional, enfrentando lo que es probablemente el más grande reto de su desarrollo cognitivo: la transición de entender el mundo a través de sus sentidos (llamado pensamiento concreto) a representar la realidad mediante símbolos, conceptos y modelos (llamado pensamiento abstracto). A esta edad los niños requieren el uso de elementos tangibles para ser capaces de procesas información y constantemente probar sus ideas..




	Es por eso que los mejor programas educativos alrededor del mundo se enfocan en el uso de elementos tangibles  para ayudar a los niños a superar este desafío. 


	Nosotros lo llevamos a otro nivel.


	Tullpi crea un puente entre el mundo que el niño naturalmente entiende y estos nuevos conceptos. 





	Con Tullpi, tu hijo aprende a contar, sumar, restar, qué son las unidades, decenas, centenas, cómo hallar el doble y la mitad, ¡Gana estrellas y conquista planetas! En resumen, todo lo que los niños tienen que aprender en el primer año del colegio, pero ¡de manera divertida!








	En colegios donde no pueden permitirse el comprar el material convencional usado para aprender matemáticas (porque es costoso), les piden a los padres coleccionar tapitas de botella. Esta es una genial solución, las tapas de botella son fáciles de manipular y vienen en diferentes colores.









	El reflector tiene dentro un pequeño espejo inclinado que se coloca encima de la cámara frontal de la Tablet (como se muestra abajo). De esta forma, la cámara capturará el área de la mesa que está justo en frente de la Tablet, detectando así la posición y color de las tapitas de botella.


 En la imagen siguiente, puedes ver cuál es el rol que cumple el reflector y cómo funciona la detección de tapitas.








	Somos de Perú y nuestro país ocupó el último lugar de educación matemática, tal como se muestra en el gráfico siguiente. Es por eso que sentimos que algo debía hacerse. 


	Pero lo triste acerca de estos resultados es que están fuertemente atados al nivel socioeconómico, lo que significa que hay una gran brecha entre la calidad de educación que unos cuantos recibe y la deficiencia o inexistente educación que el resto recibe. Este escenario está también presente en varios otros países, sobretodo en Latinoamérica.



	Por cada kit comprado, nosotros implementamos otro en un colegio de un área rural o vulnerable.


	Alrededor del mundo, existen diversas iniciativas, tales como Xprize Global Learning Challenge o Curious Learning, que buscan llevar tablets, con contenido educativo, que permitan a los niños de zonas vulnerables y rurales lograr los niveles básicos de literatura y aritmética. Gracias al precio decreciente de las tablets, creemos que es  una oportunidad para crear un impacto real.


	Nos hemos esforzado mucho en hacer que nuestros juegos funcionen de manera correcta incluso en tablets de bajo presupuesto y sin conexión a internet, con la intención de ser capaces de implementar Tullpi junto a programas enfocados en mejorar el aprendizaje de las matemáticas mediante el uso de tecnologías de información.

¿Qué es Maba?

	Maba es una iniciativa educativa sin fines de lucro, que en asociación con Curious Learning (Global Literacy Project), busca mejorar los niveles de aprendizaje de matemáticas y ciencias en los colegios más vulnerables del país a través de la donación de tablets, la implementación de una conexión a internet veloz y el acceso irrestricto a un sin número de contenidos educativos digitales. 



	Ellos empezaron el año pasado con siete colegios, logrando resultados extraordinarios (un incremento de hasta 12% en competencias matemáticas). Estos resultados aceleraron su crecimiento, haciendo que este año se expanda a 14 colegios.

El reto

	Tullpi será implementado en los primeros 7 colegios de Maba, para todos los niños de primer grado de primaria, ¡alrededor de 700 niños! Este es solo nuestro primer reto y para lograrlo ¡Necesitamos de su ayuda!Aquí puedes ver donde se encuentra ubicados los colegios.





La base y el reflector están fabricados en triplay cortado en laser.

Este kit fue especialmente diseñado para la tablet que es utilizada en estas escuelas. Debido a que la cámara de la tablet se encuentra localizada a un lado (en lugar del centro) y su ángulo de apertura es muy angosto, la tablet tiene que ser colocada a una mayor altura e incluimos un tablero que ayuda al niño a colocar las tapas en el lugar correcto y tener una mejor idea de su area de juego.

	Los kits donados van al colegio en cajas de 12 kits (twelve pack), esto es para facilitar el manejo de éstos a los profesores y optimizar espacio.

Evelyn Gómez (Operaciones):  Yo hago que las cosas suceden cueste lo que cueste.
Félix Valdivieso (Pedagogía): Estos chicos necesitan supervisión de un adulto.
Gerardo Hurtado (Arte & Diseño): Yo hago que cada parte de Tullpi le saque una sonrisa a los niños. 





	Una de las cosas que hemos aprendido en el proceso es que si estás construyendo algo para los niños, tienes que probar ¡todo! los niños siempre piensan fuera de la caja. ¿No me creen? Vean estas fotos…






Y es por esto que nunca dejamos de probar y aprender de los niños, para poder capaces de crear la experiencia adecuada para ellos.




	Durante nuestras primeras entrevistas con padres y profesores, descubrimos que las mejores prácticas en matemática tienen un rasgo en común: la transformación de objetos simples (como alimentos, carros de juguete…) o actividades cotidianas (como el almuerzo, la compra de los alimentos…) en espacios ricos de aprendizaje. Esto, combinado con las preguntas adecuadas y paciencia dan los mejores resultados. 




	Creemos que hay una gran oportunidad para crear experiencias de aprendizaje impresionantes y significativas, con sólo poner un poco de magia en este tipo de elementos. Y esta es la ruta que queremos explorar. Hoy en día usamos tapitas de botellas pero mañana será...



	Siempre hay retos, pero nuestra promesa es que creceremos hasta alcanzarlos. Haremos todo lo que esté en nuestras manos para entregar nuestras recompensas a tiempo o antes.


	Nostros estamos comprometidos con mantener informados a todos los nuestros contribuyentes. Nuestra promesa de entrega será desafiada en todo momento por las complejidades conocidas de fabricación, producción, envío, y mucho más.

Preguntas frecuentes
- ¿Si se me pierde una tapita, cómo la reemplazo?
Tullpi funciona con cualquier tapita de botella de plástico de tamaño regular (30mm), es por eso que puedes reemplazar estas tapitas con alguna otra que encuentres en casa y decidas reciclar. ¡No hay problema!
- ¿Para qué sirve el tablero en el kit donado?
Las tablets que son donadas, a los colegios públicos dentro de Maba, tienen la cámara en una esquina y no en el centro, como el iPad, es por ello que para jugar es necesario delimitar campo de juego y así se les haga más fácil a los niños saber dónde pueden poner la tapita y hacer que el  juego funcione de la forma adecuada.
- ¿En qué idiomas está la aplicación?
La aplicación está desarrollada en español e inglés. 
- ¿Funciona para Android?
La aplicación de Tullpi ha sido desarrollada para sistema operativo Android y iOs. Sin embargo, nuestro juego cuenta además con un kit físico, en esta primera producción éste ha sido diseñado para el iPad. Nuestro próximo diseño será para una Tablet Android, y junto a la comunidad de esta campaña decidiremos para cuál lo haremos.
- ¿Para qué iPads funciona?
Actualmente Tullpi funciona con el iPad 2, 3, 4, iPad air 1, 2, iPad mini 2, 4.
- ¿Por qué tapitas?
En colegios donde no pueden permitirse el comprar el material convencional usado para aprender matemáticas (porque es costoso), les piden a los padres coleccionar tapitas de botella, lo cual es una solución genial, las tapas de botella son fáciles de manipular y vienen en diferentes colores, lo cual se aprovecha para identificar cada color con un concepto distinto, así las tapas azules se asocian a las unidades, las rojas a las decenas y las verdes a las centenas.
- ¿Qué juegos tendrá Tullpi?
Tullpi viene con nuestro primer juego FIRST, una colección de juegos educativos de matemática, éste contiene 6 juegos que desarrollan el contenido que un niño aprende en su primer año de educación escolar: Contar, Sumas 1, Sumas 2, Restas, Sistema numérico, Doble y Mitad.
En este tiempo de desarrollo lo que aprendimos fue que absolutamente todo debe ser diseñado en base a lo que el usuario quiere y requiere, así que el desarrollo de nuestros nuevos juegos será en base a lo que ustedes, nuestros primeros usuarios, nos digan que quieren o necesitan.
- ¿Sólo se puede jugar con tapitas?
Nuestro primer juego, FIRST, está diseñado para que funcione solo con tapitas, sin embargo seguiremos creando nuevos juegos y éstos podrían funcionar con elementos que pueden sorprendernos incluso a nosotros.
- ¿Quién dona las tablets?
Para jugar Tullpi es necesario tener una Tablet, entonces es necesario que los colegios públicos a los que donamos Tullpi cuenten con tablets para usar en clase. Por ello, nosotros trabajamos en conjunto con el Proyecto Maba (www.proyectomaba.org), nuestro aliado estratégico, ellos implementan el uso de tablets como recurso para el aprendizaje en colegios de zonas vulnerables/rurales de Perú y nosotros donamos los kits para jugar Tullpi.




English Version

 


	We created Tullpi because we see children frustrated with the conventional ways of learning math. 


	Tullpi transforms math into a constant experiment, creating an intuitive connection between abstract numbers and objects in the real world. Children use simple bottle caps to solve mathematical challenges with their own hands.


	Tullpi offers you a kit that transforms your iPad into a play/learn station. And for each kit purchased, we implement one in a public school in a vulnerable area.





	From the ages of 4 to 7, children are facing what is most likely the biggest challenge of their cognitive development: the transition from understanding the world through their senses (called concrete thinking) to represent reality through symbols, concepts and models (called abstract thinking). At this stage children require the use of tangible elements to be able to process information and constantly test their ideas.




	That is why the best education programs around the world focus on the use of tangible elements to help children to overcome this challenge. 


	We took it to another level.


	Tullpi creates a bridge between the world the child naturally understands and these new challenging concepts. 





	With Tullpi, your child learns to count, sum, subtract, what are units, tens, hundreds, to find the double and a half, while he/she wins stars and conquers planets. In summary, everything kids have to learn in the first year of school, but making it fun!




	In schools where they could not afford to buy the conventional equipment used for math education (because they are kind of expensive), they asked parents to collect bottle caps. It is a great solution because bottle caps are easy to manipulate, they have different colors.







	The reflector has a small inclined mirror inside, that should be placed on the tablet (as shown below). This way, the frontal camera will capture the area of the table in front of the tablet, detecting the position and color of the bottle caps.





In the image below, you can see what is the role of the reflector and how the bottle cap detection works.










	We are from Peru and our country ranks last in math education, as shown in the graph below. This is why we felt something had to be done. 




	But the sad thing about this result is it is strongly tied to the socioeconomic class, which means that there is a huge gap between the quality of the education a few people can get and the deficient or inexistent education that the rest receive. 


This scenario is present in many other countries, especially in Latin-america.



For each kit purchased, we implement one in a school in a vulnerable or rural area.


	Around the world, there are many initiatives to bring tablet-based educative content such as Xprize Global Learning Challenge or Curious Learning to allow kids in vulnerable and rural areas achieve basic levels of literacy and numeracy. Thanks to the decreasing price of tablets, we believe this is an opportunity  to make a real impact.


	We invested a lot of effort to make our games work well even in low budget tablets with the intention of being able to implement Tullpi in programs for math education improvement. Most of them use these kinds of tablets.

What is Maba?

	Maba Project is a non for profit initiative that has partnered with Curious Learning (Global Literacy Project) with the intention of improving math and science  levels in the most vulnerable schools in Peru.  They implement tablets, a connection to fast internet, give access to countless digital educational content and train teachers. 




	They started last year with seven schools achieving extraordinary results (an increase up to 12% percent in math competences). These results have accelerated their growth, causing them to expand to 14 schools this year.
The challenge

	Tullpi will be implemented in their 7 initial schools, for all the kids in the first year of primary school. That is around 700 kids!   This is just our first challenge. And for this we need your help!



The base and reflector are made out of laser cutted plywood.
This kit was specially designed for the tablet used in this schools. And because the camera is placed on a side of the tablet (instead of being on the middle) and it's opening angle is very narrow, the tablet have to be placed higher and we included a board that helps the kid to place the bottle caps on the right place and have a better sense of their playing field.The donated kits go to the schools in a twelve pack box. This helps reduce the space used inside the classroom and facilitates the delivery process during class. Imagine how hard would be to handle 28 to 32 boxes for each teacher.


For makers and hackers

	The CAD files of the base and reflector will be available, so you can make your own designs and add a personal touch. 


	Our technology is built to work with Unity, the most popular game development engine. If you get a developer kit you will have early access to the SDK to start playing and developing new experiences and games using our technology. 


	We are a team that believes education is the most empowering and transformative tool. We gather experience in computer vision, pedagogy, human computer interaction and design.
                 Adolfo Valdivieso (Technology): I teach computers to recognize and track bottle caps, develop video-games and that kind of stuff.Evelyn Gómez (Operations): I make things happen whatever it takes.Félix Valdivieso (Pedagogy): These guys needed some adult supervision.Gerardo Hurtado (Art & Design): I make sure that every single part of Tullpi brings a smile in the kid's face.



	One of the things we learned in the process is that if you are building something for kids, you have to test everything as kids always think outside the box. Don’t believe me? Check this pictures…









	In our early interviews with parents and teachers, we found that the best practices in math had a common trait: transforming simple objects (such as food, car toys or so) or everyday activities (buying groceries, cleaning the house, etc.) into rich learning spaces. This combined with asking the right questions and patience gave them the best results. 



	We believe there is a great opportunity to create awesome and significant learning experiences, just by putting a little bit of magic into these kinds of elements. And this is the route we want to explore. Today we use bottle caps but tomorrow will be…

	There are always challenges, but our promise is that we'll rise to meet them. We'll do everything in our power to ship our rewards on time or earlier.


	We are committed to keep our backers informed. Our promise to deliver will be challenged at all times by the known complexities of manufacturing, production, shipping, and more.


	Therefore, in the event that unexpected issues arise, we will do our biggest effort to minimize the impact on our backers and dedicate ourselves to providing the best experience.


	If you have any question or doubt, don’t hesitate to write me to adolfo@tullpi.com




	Thank you very much!!!






FAQs- If I lose a bottle cap how can I replace it?
Tullpi works with any plastic bottle cap of regular size (30 mm), which is why you can replace these caps with some other you find at home and decide to recycle. No problem!- What is the board in the kit donated?
The tablets that are donated to public schools (part of Maba), have the camera in a corner and not in the center, like the iPad, which is why is necessary to define the play field and in that way make easier for children to know where they can put the cap and make the game to function properly.-What languages is the application?
The application is developed initially in Spanish and English.- Does the app work for android?
The application of Tullpi has been developed for Android and iOs operating system. However, our game also has a physical kit, in this first batch our kit has been designed for iPad. Our next kit design will be for ANDROID Tablet, and the community from this campaign will help us decide which one will be.- Which iPad models does it work with?
Currently Tullpi works with the iPad 2, 3, 4, iPad air 1, 2, iPad mini 2, 4.- Why bottle caps?
In schools where they cannot afford to buy the conventional material used to learn math (because it is quite expensive), ask parents to collect bottle caps, which is an awesome solution, bottle caps are easy to handle and come in different colors!, which is used to identify each color with a different concept, and blue caps are associated with the units, the red ones with tens and green ones to the hundreds.- What games does Tullpi have?
Tullpi comes with our FIRST game, a collection of 6 educational math games which develop the content that children learn in their first year of school: Counting, Sumas 1 Sumas 2 Subtraction, Number System, Double and Half.

This time of creation what we learned is that absolutely everything must be designed based on what the user wants and needs, so the development of our new games will be based on what you, our first users, tell us you would love to play.- You can only play with bottle caps?
Our first game, FIRST, is designed to work only with caps, however continue to create new games and they could work with elements that can surprise even us.- Who bring the tablets to schools?
To play Tullpi you need a tablet, then it is necessary that public schools that have donated Tullpi with tablets for use in class. Therefore, we work together with the Maba Project (www.proyectomaba.org), our strategic partner, they implement the use of tablets as a resource for learning in schools vulnerable / rural areas of Peru and we donate the kits to play Tullpi.",75.0,6,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>WHO ARE WE</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>We are two young Romanian women, studying in the UK, at the University of Kent and at the London School of Economics.  We have started a film festival in Bacau, a post-industial town in Romania, which at the time was lacking any alternative cultural activities. Most importantly, there was only one commercial cinema in town.</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>we decided to make a free film festival, with Romanian new wave and classic films. </strong>We have focused on open-air screenings, where anyone could join.

In the previous years, we have been supported by local council funds. However, this year they decided not to fund out project.
Therefore, we are asking for your help to keep this school happening, as it is an unique educational and cultural project! 
 


 
WHAT WE NEED
 
We like to aim high, so the budget we have applied with was around 5000 US dollars. If you would like to have a look at our budget before you make a donation, we will be happy to send it to you! We would like to come as close as possible to this sum! 
 
We want to say thank you to our donors and since we cannot give each of you a hug, a shake of hand and an enthusiastic smile, we would like to offer you a couple of personalised gifts! 
 
EACH OF YOU WILL RECEIVE A GIFT FROM US, DEPENDING ON THE SUM YOU WILL DONATE. ALL THE ITEMS ARE PERSONALISED WITH THE FESTIVAL BEAUTIFUL LOGO. IT COULD BE A PEN, A POSTER OF THE SUMMER SCHOOL, A T-SHIRT, OR EVEN A NOTEBOOK. 
 
We do not what to think that the summer school will not happen this year, so each donation will help a lot!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

The Sigma Tau Delta Mu Xi chapter is hosted at Mansfield University of Pennsylvania. Sigma Tau Delta is an international honors society for English, and aims to promote literacy while sharing its love for the English language, and English literature. This project is to create a memorial space for a beloved professor of the English Department at Mansfield University of Pennsylvania.

Additionally, contributions will be used to purchase plants for the space, including flowering trees and other plants and flowers. 
Any funds we raise over our goal will be used to purchase a memorial bench, and to fund other potential ideas we have for the space. 
    Risks & Challenges We have the full support of our administration and grounds crew, so our only challenge is in raising the funds. 
    Other Ways You Can Help Even if you can't donate financially to our project, we would very much appreciate if you shared it on social media, and/or sent positive vibes in our direction!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p> </p>
<p>As a lot of you know I'm attending Ministry School at Bethel Atlanta(BASSM), and tuition payments are coming up! The tuition plan that I chose was 3 payments of $800. I paid the first of the three in early September but now the next is coming up shortly and I have found that my budget is incapable of paying the next payment of $800. I have found a job recently which was a huge blessing, but it's only making enough to allow me to pay living expenses, i.e. rent, utilities, groceries, laundry, gas, etc.. Everything so far has come out of my own pocket by the grace of God, but now I'm in need of His people. The next payment is due early November, and the 3rd and final payment is due early Febuary. Any little bit helps more than you know! :)</p>
<p> If I have to go home now I would be able to say with confidence that it has all been worth it. However, the chances of me walking into this opportunity were slim and I believe I was able to be here for a reason and I would love to be able to walk that out in it's fullest possible way.</p>
<p> My goal in coming here was to become a prospering advocate for God's heart through His works, and every day I feel more in tune with His plans for me.</p>
<p> I would like to thank Bethel Atlanta for everything they've instilled in me so far, it's an amazing experience and one that I pray won't end soon.</p>
<p> Thank you so much!</p>
<p> I love you!</p>

<h3>Hello! Thank you for visiting my indiegogo site to help me fundraise money!!</h3>
<p>My name is Pamela and a couple years ago I was matched up to my little sister in the Big Brothers Big Sisters program.  She is a wonderful girl with lots of personality and a huge heart.  She has really come out of her shell since we have been together.  She is really committed to carving out her own path in this world vs. accepting the cards she has been dealt.  She takes public transportation for 3 hours everyday just to get a better high school education than the school in her neighborhood.  </p>
<p>She is an inspiration to me which is why I really want to help her celebrate her 16th birthday with a party and memory she will always remember.  My little sister passed up her quinceanera (15th birthday party) in exchange for a 16th birthday party.  But she recently found out due to financial reasons she would not be able to have that party she was dreaming of.  So please help me surprise her with such a wonderful gift so she knows she has people on her side, rooting her on for her accomplishments and focus!!  </p>
<h3>Where the money will go:</h3>
<p>The money I am raising will be to rent out a space large enough to hold about 30 of her high school classmates, food, music, beverages, entertainment/music, (chaperones will be volunteers) decorations, gift bags for her guests and a new dress for her party.  </p>
<p>The biggest cost will be a venue so if anyone knows of a place that is a good value or maybe can be donated for the evening I would love suggestions!!</p>
<p>I want to give her everything she passed up for her quinceanera for her Sweet 16.  I want her to have fun with her friends and not think about financial status.  I want her to have an evening she will remember forever because someone cared enough for her to put together a birthday party.  I want her to realize that she matters.</p>
<p>If I am not able to raise the entire goal to throw her a party I will take whatever I was able to raise and either have a gathering for a few of her friends or take her out to dinner depending on how much was raised.  But I know we can do this together!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I know this may seem like a costly goal to raise for but when I think to myself how it must feel to have never had a true birthday party with friends, no pizza parties, no bowling parties, no pin the tail on the donkey I feel like she deserves an amazing party for her 16th to make up for that.  Please help me bring a smile to her face so this just isn't another day in her life.  A life where everything seems to come hard and seems unreachable.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are not able to contribute financially there are other ways you can help me as well:</p>
<p>-Spread the word about my campaign.  If you have friends/family that have children and might be in a position to donate even a little because they know they would want their own children to be celebrated on their birthdays.  There are share tools on the Indigogo site so you can easily forward this on.</p>
<p>-If you know of any on in the even industry that might be interested in donating to my goal.  Everything from a DJ, venue, food to perhaps a store that might donate a party dress.</p>

<strong><em>CHILD ‘N FAMILY</em></strong><strong> CENTER IN AMBATO, ECUADOR OPERATED BY DANIELLE’S CHILDREN FUND</strong> </h2>
<p><strong>Daniëlle Children's Fund (DCF)</strong><strong> is a non-profit organization run by volunteers. DCF focuses on guiding children and their families in need. Besides providing a safe environment for children at risk, the Foundation also helps parents to create their own resources and possibilities to build a better future, and to assume their own responsibility for the upbringing of their children. DCF works closely together with the governmental institutions involved in child protection.</strong></p>
<p class=""bodytext""><strong>DCF established its first <em>Child 'N Family </em>Center in Kathmandu, Nepal in 2001. The second Center came to existence in Ambato, Ecuador in 2009. </strong><strong>Two programs are offered at the Ecuador Center – the </strong><strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Temporary Institutional Custody Program</span></em></strong><strong>, and the </strong><strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Systemic Family Services Program</span></em></strong><strong>. Both of these programs focus on the children in need, as well as on the family as a whole.<br/></strong><br/><strong>*Temporary Institutional Custody - </strong>In this program, the <em>Child ‘N Family</em> Center offers temporary custody to children in at-risk situations (due to, for instance, physical abuse, sexual abuse or severe neglect). Every year around 30 children, boys and girls from 3 to 10 years old, receive a temporarily home at the Center - a safe roof above their head, food, education, love, and care. From the moment they enter the program, the focus is on family reunification. The application of an intensive guidance program is used to facilitate the safe return of the children in temporary custody to their original families. This goal is usually achieved within a six-month time frame. After reunification, the Center enables the child to live safely at home by continuing to provide intensive socio-psychological services in the child’s home environment, follow-up family therapies, and group workshops.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>*Systemic Family Services -</strong> In this program, the focus is on family preservation. Through socio-psychological interventions and stimulation of active family engagement, the <em>Child ‘N Family</em> Center manages to keep families securely together without permanently keeping the children in need out of their homes. The Center offers psychological, social, educational, and medical support often in the domestic environment or through family therapy sessions and workshops organized and held at the center. Each calendar year, the Center improves the quality of lives of about 100 dysfunctional families by helping them to transform their domestic situation into a safer and more secure environment for their children to live in.</p></div>","As the winter holidays are drawing closer and closer, it is almost impossible not to think about gifts.

Through socio-psychological interventions and stimulation of active family engagement, the Child ‘N Family Center manages to keep families securely together without permanently keeping the children in need out of their homes. The Center offers psychological, social, educational, and medical support often in the domestic environment or through family therapy sessions and workshops organized and held at the center. Each calendar year, the Center improves the quality of lives of about 100 dysfunctional families by helping them to transform their domestic situation into a safer and more secure environment for their children to live in.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><em>My name is Julie Drucker and I am a dancer and choreographer.  I'm raising money for a Motion Theater training in San Francisco, CA.  </em></p>
<p>I have produced inter-generational dance performance projects with communities of women and teens in the Bay Area and Northern California. Currently, I'm choreographing a work that addresses our relationship to technology called “The Body Feels What the Body Feels,” which involves college students, artists and teachers. I live in Ukiah, California, a rural area of 14,000 people, and there is limited access to the arts, especially dance. I have also taught dance in the public schools for many years. In 2009 I received grant funding from the Mendocino Arts Council for GASP, Get Arts in the Schools program, to teach at Anderson Valley High School in Boonville, CA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><span><span><strong>Motion Theater Training</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p>I am currently enrolled in a six-month “Motion Theater” immersion program in San Francisco with the Motion Institute, led by the creator of this work, Nina Wise. “Motion Theater”uses spoken language combined with a physical embodiment of an experience through movement in a witness format. This performance art also has the potential to change people's relationship to the stories they're telling, which lends a spiritual and healing quality to the work. By paying attention to the details of one's experience and verbalizing them in an improvisational way, combined with embodying those details moment by moment, an individual can learn to relate differently to his/her past.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><span><span><strong>Community Impact</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p>I am looking for funding for this program for two reasons: to inform my own dance projects and to share this form with young and old alike in my community. I believe this work could inspire and move many people, since it gives them a way to transform their lives through the expression of stories and feelings.</p>
<p>I feel I have a large capacity to make people feel at ease, which allows greater trust to develop. I see it in my dance projects and in my teaching to both teens and adults. My dance performance project “Risk of Falling” featured 7 women between the ages of 25 and 85, all telling their stories of taking a personal risk. I also saw my students at Anderson Valley High, many of whom were English language learners, take greater risks due to the trust that I helped facilitate. In studying Motion Theater, it gives me yet another form in which to make people feel free. There is almost nothing that rivals how happy and content one can be after using sound, narrative and movement. The amount of joy I experience doing this form is unparalleled. A million heartfelt thanks for your generous help. Your financial support isn't just for one artist, but for the well being of many others.</p>
<p>Because I live in a very economically challenged area I intend to offer classes for a nominal fee and to teenagers at no cost.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p><span><span><span><strong>What I'm Requesting</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p>1) $3500 Motion Theater Training fee</p>
<p>2) $200 transportation to workshops</p>
<p>3) Once the training has ended, I'll use the remaining $1700 for studio rental, insurance, and advertising.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p><span><span><span><strong>What You Receive</strong></span></span></span></p>

<h3>What's this all about?</h3>
<p>Since 2004 I've been working with young children and with adults who are inspired by teachers, children and families from Reggio Emilia Italy. I support a staff of 28 teachers who are doing this work one on one, in teams and as a whole staff. Now, I'd like to go there to learn first hand about the history and about what's happening today. From my mentors and studies of the Reggio Emilia approach I've learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>that young children are protagonists in their own lives and deserve as much freedom and responsibility as possible.</li>
<li>that knowledge is constructed in community, within relationships among people and between people and their place, their things, their ideas</li>
<li>to hold a deep respect for the families of the children in my care, to be ready to be changed by my experiences and conversations with them</li>
<li>that teachers can be co-collaborators, co-learners, co-conspirators with children instead of experts imparting knowledge</li>
</ul>
<p>I love bringing these concepts to other teachers each day, and I look forward to deepening my own understanding of these ideas and their history in Reggio Emilia.</p>
<h3>Why Italy?</h3>
<p>In my current work, I don't have many real peers; non-supervisory support staff who are entirely invested in the quality of the community, our relationships and our collective knowledge. In Reggio Emilia, I'll meet many other people who do this work, and I can't even imagine yet what I'll learn!</p>
<h3>Relying on My Community</h3>
<p>When I first started planning this trip it was no trouble for me to pay for it out of pocket. Now that I've started, my husband has joined the ranks of the underemployed, and I can't justify the cost of this trip anymore. After much soul searching, I've decided to ask you for help getting to Italy.</p>
<p>I'm looking for $2300. That's 1/2 of the cost of my airfare, conference fees (I'll be there with 300 teachers from all over the world) and hotel costs + the 4% that Indiegogo charges for running this site.</p>
<p>I'm offering you some writing, some pictures, even some souveniers of my trip.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"">The Impact</span></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>When I traveled to New Zealand in 2010, I was inspired by the teachers and children I met there. Today, the teachers Peabody Terrace Children's Center:</p>
<ul>
<li>write learning stories (a relationship-based form of narrative assessment),</li>
<li>feel safer letting children assess their own risk on the playground and in big body games with one another,</li>
<li>created new policies through consensus building</li>
<li>are designing a natural playground,</li>
<li>embrace conflict with one another and among children</li>
<li>bring their whole selves, their passions, their interests and their histories to their teaching.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the work of these teachers themselves, of course, but much of this was informed by the stories, images and relationships I brought back with me from my time in Auckland with a brilliant collection of educators.  I'm so excited to think about what I might bring back to my community from Italy this  year.</p>
<p>I love working in a field, and in a specific culture that encourages trust, deep relationships and risk-taking. Now, I'm doing what I've encourage countless children and a few dozen teachers to do: ask for help.</p>
<p>Please be sure to share this campaign with friends who may contribute.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The art of acting is my life. My name is Evan Langle and I have been an aspiring actor since I was born, no joke, I came out the womb holding a skull while reciting Hamlet! Ok, I'm slightly exaggerating, but I was writing and directing plays with my cousins as young as eight years old.  As I graduated High School, I stormed the stages of Pasadena City College in 5 main stage shows and 3 one act plays. Whilst doing that, I moved to Japan for a quick time, joined the Pacific Okinawa Players and performed patriotically for our american soldiers and their families.  </p>
<p>Clinging to the edge of my seat, I recently sent in an application for the 8 week summer intensive program 'Shakespere &amp; His Contemporaries' at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts (LAMDA) and was offered a spot! Attending LAMDA has been a huge dream of mine since I was in high school. It is one of the leading drama schools in the UK and has produced such legends as Jim Broadbent, Brian Cox, and Donald Sutherland to name a few.</p>
<p>Now having achieved the first big step, the next obstacle I face is MONEY. I'll share with you what my acting professor and mentor told me in a recent email upon hearing the news of my acceptance...</p>
<p>""You are a very gifted young  man, Evan Langle, and deserve and have earned this very good fortune. It ain’t cheap. But you will be affected by this experience the rest of your life. Again, congrats.""</p>
<p>Your contribution in helping me achieve this TREMENDOUS-STUPENDOUS opportunity will open many doors and add immensley to my inner growth as an artist. Not only will I be learning a great deal but I will also be gaining life experience by studying acting outside of LA in a different culture that is less 'fame' induced and more about the basic love of the craft. </p>
<p>   </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Tuition for the LAMDA 8 week summer course is $6,052 due by April 1</p>
<p>The housing provided by LAMDA is $2,700 due by March 15th (I am currently looking for alternate housing that might be cheaper, however if I cannot find any by the deadline I will be going with the school's option)</p>
<p>Altogether tuition &amp; housing comes to $8752. Anything over that will be going towards airfare, food, transportation &amp; student visa.</p>
<p>I will be applying for a loan as the due dates for the fees are coming up extremely fast. All the money raised by this campaign will be put towards paying back the loan.</p>
<p>There are some perks for your donations, aside form the inner satisfaction of helping one achieve their dreams ;) Various gifts ranging from simple hugs to me putting on a live show purely for your entertainment =)</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2> The Impact</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p> The first time I stepped out on the stage in 2009, as the drunken hopeless romantic Dr. Gerald Lyman in 'Bus Stop', I was overwhelmed by this wonderful feeling almost like electricity. There is nothing greater for an actor than the power you have to move an audience, whether it be to laughter or to tears. Theater is so trascending. To create real life moments on a stage or in front of a camera, there is nothing else like it in the world. It is one of the oldest and greatest forms of artistic expression. When I finished that first performance and had taken my bow, my body zinging with adrenaline, my father came up to me and in his usual jokester like way, smiled and said ""You were funnier than shit!!"" I hugged him for a good minute and when I stepped back and looked at him, he had gone teary-eyed and said ""I'm proud of you."" I knew right then that I was on the right track and this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>Taking this summer course at LAMDA may not lead to an Academy Award or guarantee myself an agent. What this will do is provide me a once in a lifetime experience that will further my knowledge and help me grow as an artist so that I may continue to tell stories and move people.  </p>

My name is Bethany and I'm currently studying a level 4 diploma in Art and Design at my local college but this autumn I have been accepted to study Conservation and Restoration at university. I am keen to gain as much experience as possible in this area so that I can make an effective contribution in the future.</p>
<p><a href=""http://adventuresinpreservation.org/upcoming-adventures/messors-fresco-conservation-2013/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Adventures in Preservation </a>offer a three week hands on study camp at the underground churches of Puglia that are in danger of disappearing from Italy's heritage. Due to Italy's (and much of Europe) financial situation at the moment, it cannot afford the extent of conservation work needed and so volunteers are indispenable in this area. Italy's wealth of history and heritage is not only of importance to Italy itself but much is of international consequence.</p>
<p>Fees for this project are about £2000 not including travel to Italy. Your donations would go towards my accommodation and food, lectures and educational excursion as well as materials and other transport. If I were not to reach this goal, (I am largely expecting to pay for this from working alongside my college course) it would go towards my fees, materials and living costs for university next year.</p>
<p>For centuries, the citizens of Matera were buried in the network of underground chambers, ossuaries, and catacombs beneath San Pietro Barisano. For a long period of time, the church was the city’s only cemetery and as such holds a wealth of archaeological and epigraphic information about the history and culture of Matera. San Pietro also boasts a fine array 17th century frescoes, including depictions of the Annunication, Madonna and Child, and a spectrum of assorted saints. Collectively, the rupestrian churches of Puglia possess wall paintings that span a thousand years and create a visual document of religious and artistic evolution. At the oldest churches, the style of the wall paintings reflects Byzantine influences. Finally, the churches are spectacles in themselves, their hulking frames emerging from and blending into their mountainous backdrop. The Sassi and the Park of the Rupestrian Churches of Matera was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1993.</p>
<p>I am lucky enough to live in one of the most beautiful and culturally rich places in England, the Peak District. Whilst at school I have volunteered at a local museum; updating archive systems, giving tours and administrative work. In more hands on practical experience, since last autumn I have been learning the traditional craft of book binding which is hugely rewarding. I would love the opportunity to apply the skills learnt here and in my art &amp; design diploma to the conservation of even such a small, but still important part of our world heritage.</p>
<p>Of course, if you cannot contribute financially simply sharing my venture or the work of any these organisations would be immensely appreciated. Thank you.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Linda Sanogo and I am 23 years old. I grew up in Niger with a Danish mother and Malian father. I came to Denmark for over 10 years ago and I am now studying French literature at the University of Aarhus with the purpose of take my masters in African studies. In my spare time I paint and watch movies. In addition I write for <a href=""http://aarhusculture.com/?s=linda"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""aarhus culture"">www.aarhusculture.com</a> and works as a fashion and advertising model where I have 3 agencies in Denmark, Germany and Lithuania.</p>

<p>In 2010 I was elected Miss Mali, and have traveled around the world and represented Mali as ambassador at four major beauty pageants. I did it with intend of raising awareness of this beautiful sub Saharan nation. Mali is known for its handicrafts and especially its music. My collection will be donated to a specific project for the country's schoolchildren via <a href=""http://www.globalpartnership.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.globalpartnership.org</a>.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>My goal</strong> with this collection is to sponsor a scholarship program for Mali's children thru <a href=""http://www.globalpartnership.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.globalpartnership.org</a>. Public education in Mali is, in principle, provided free of charge and is compulsory for nine years between the ages of 7 and 16.  The system encompasses six years of primary education beginning at age seven, followed by six years of secondary education, generally divided into two three-year cycles. However, Mali’s actual primary school enrollment rate is low, in large part because families are unable to cover the cost of uniforms, books, supplies, and other fees required to attend even public school. Since it is very expensive to send a child to school for an ordinary Malian family, many choose not to send their children to school and instead send them of to find work. It is especially girls who are vulnerable. A certain percentage will get years of schooling before they find themselves forced to leave school because the cost is too high for the family. It is a vicious circle and therefore the money will be donated for scholarships and tools for girls and boys in Mali, so they have a better chance of creating a secure future for themselves and their families. </p>
<p><strong>For </strong><span><strong>174,16 USD (<span>134,15 EUR) </span> one child can go to school for a year with all exspences.</strong> </span></p>

<h3>The current situation in Mali</h3>

<p>Islamic extremists in Mali control the northern part of the country that is the size of France. As part of the extremist ideology, Islamists has banned music, alcohol, smoking and sports on TV.

<p>Salvatore SAGÜES Amnesty International says the Voice of America News that the militants recruit children and forcing them into battle. ""We have already learned that some child soldiers were sent to the front. Some of them have been injured and killed (...) It is prohibited under international law.

<p>The United States, France, England and Denmark sent ""help"" under the disguise that they will stop these extreme Muslims.

<p>For the past five years, we've been grinding the freshest flour around, helping people reconnect with their food and their miller. This year, we're doing something different.</p>
<p>While our product hasn't changed, our goal has. Since January, we've been directing <strong>100% of the proceeds of all our sales towards traveling to South Sudan to build a bicycle grinder</strong> - just like the one we've been busy turning for the last half decade.</p>
<h3>That's right...we're bringing bike-mill technology from the Roberts Creek rainforest to the northern edge of the youngest country on the planet!</h3>
<p>On December 9th, my brother Josh and I will fly to Kampala, Uganda, and make our way 1500 kilometres overland to the village of Panlang in Northern Bahr el Ghazal state, South Sudan. There we will attempt to construct a bike-mill for the community in partnership with the Pan-Aweil Development Agency, which has agreed to organize/coordinate our project on the ground.</p>
<h3>Follow along with us as we fundraise for this incredible journey! </h3>
<p>This journey will take us to one of the most remote and inaccessible corners of South Sudan, a country emerging from decades of civil war and chronic underdevelopment. 'Roads' on maps are little more than sand tracks for hundreds of kilometres, transport is unreliable and basic supplies are hard to locate. It's certainly going to be a challenge to get to Panlang, not to mention actually building the bike-mill on site using local materials and local labour!</p>
<h3>All this is going to take $$$ - so we're looking for contributions towards on-the-ground expenses that will make this project a success in South Sudan. This money will not be used for flight tickets; we've secured flights already.</h3>
<p>In order to make sure that we committ 100% of our efforts towards this goal, we are utilizing a combination of business as (un)usual (donating 100% of our profits in 2013 to this objective) personalized contributions and this crowd funding campaign. Based on years of past experience, we are confident that these multiple funding sources will allow us to reach our goal by November, 2013. </p>
<h2>Every dollar you donate will be directed towards constructing a bike-mill in Panlang, including paying for found materials and local labour.</h2>

<h3><strong>Derick's Dream is to Build a School</strong></h3>
<p>Wanonda Derick is a passionate and capable young man, with a dream to improve his community and create opportunities for the young orphans in his care. You can help him do this.  With the $3500US we are raising here, he will be able to fulfil his dream and build his school—five classrooms, for these young children at the Kepac Children’s Home and surrounding community in the Kazo Central Zone in Uganda.</p>
<p>Derick is an orphan who is running an orphanage, and he’s my friend. When I spoke to another man who also works for the children in that area, thinking he might be overseeing Derick, he said, this is Derick’s project. He’s in charge. </p>
<p>In his own words, he isn’t doing this for himself, he’s doing it for his community, and I’m doing this for him.  But we need your help. Thank you for joining his community!</p>

<p>My name is Gregory Reese and I am from Cleveland Ohio in the USA. I started practicing meditation in 2003 and during my 3rd sitting I saw an incredible Blue light shimmering directly in front of my eyes. This magnificent event led me down a path of awakening where I eventually became consciously aware of child abuse I suffered beginning at the age of five. Thanks to my learning and practicing Yoga, I was able to surrender and let go of painful wounds that I had suppressed for decades, wounds that had caused me to live a hurtful and destructive life. Thanks to the practice of Yoga I have discovered the joy of Self Love, and thanks to this I have learned to truly live a life filled with Love and Happiness.</p>
<p>I am here to raise the funds I will need to become a certified Yoga Instructor in the Integral Yoga Institute tradition. Sri Swami Satchidananda created this tradition, it is the tradition that gave me the tools to liberate myself from my own suffering. I have since learned that my purpose in this life is to teach others how they too can heal, grow, and transform their lives with the practice of Yoga. This is the beginning of my own transformation into the vocation of my heart's desire, my soul's purpose.</p>
<p>All those who contribute to this campaign will not only assist myself in the realization of my life's work, but will also assist in the healing of humanity by helping to provide the world with one more passionate Yoga instructor who wants to make a difference. They will be assisting the Veterans in my community suffering from PTSD that I volunteer to teach.

<p>Now understanding the value of self love, a life of joy, and a peaceful mind, I am eager to teach this to anyone who would like to learn.

<p> </p></div>","My name is Gregory Reese and I am from Cleveland Ohio in the USA. I started practicing meditation in 2003 and during my 3rd sitting I saw an incredible Blue light shimmering directly in front of my eyes. This magnificent event led me down a path of awakening where I eventually became consciously aware of child abuse I suffered beginning at the age of five. Thanks to my learning and practicing Yoga, I was able to surrender and let go of painful wounds that I had suppressed for decades, wounds that had caused me to live a hurtful and destructive life. Thanks to the practice of Yoga I have discovered the joy of Self Love, and thanks to this I have learned to truly live a life filled with Love and Happiness.
I am here to raise the funds I will need to become a certified Yoga Instructor in the Integral Yoga Institute tradition. Sri Swami Satchidananda created this tradition, it is the tradition that gave me the tools to liberate myself from my own suffering. I have since learned that my purpose in this life is to teach others how they too can heal, grow, and transform their lives with the practice of Yoga. This is the beginning of my own transformation into the vocation of my heart's desire, my soul's purpose.
All those who contribute to this campaign will not only assist myself in the realization of my life's work, but will also assist in the healing of humanity by helping to provide the world with one more passionate Yoga instructor who wants to make a difference. They will be assisting the Veterans in my community suffering from PTSD that I volunteer to teach. They will be assisting their own positive karma as well, simply by giving to an auspicious cause.

The JLPT is available twice a year in the Philippines; and this certificate looks very good on a resume in Japan, as it is evidence of one’s Japanese language ability. Our goalWe feel that it is our responsibility to assist our neighbor, the Philippines, and to gain an even better relationship between our countries in a way that appeals to each country both of us. Moreover, they will have the opportunity to meet people from all over the world coming to Japan for the Tokyo Olympics and hopefully gain a broader world view. We hope that our students will carry these experiences with them as they continue to grow, and develop good relationships with people from various countries. Our goal is to facilitate a borderless, peaceful future.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Mermaid Garden</h3>
<ul>
<li>I have always known a few things: that I wanted to be a teacher, and that I love the water are two of them.  My first memory is in a pool playing with my mom, and my first job at 16 was Lifeguarding for the City of Boise Natatorium and Hydrotube.  </li>
<li>I have been Coaching swimming now for 18 years, and I have always been a teacher who is teaching the kids much more than swimming: how to allow the water to hold them up, how to allow others to support them, how to support each other, to share ideas, to be creative, to use imagination.  How to self-cope: talking to oneself, to your body, to your fears, teaching your body to be soft, telling yourself truths instead of fears, using the water to connect all parts of oneself nurturing the total child in return.  Breathing, and moving, and imagery work, all for the sake of feeling gooooood, feeling comfortable and happy in the water.</li>
<li>I found that solely teaching in the water was draining, and began Coaching motor development outside the pool 12 years ago for balance.  I worked at a gymnastics gym, teaching children ages walking to 5 years old all the skills they would need to be healthy athletes of any sport or simply life.  This transferred over to yoga well, because I found that just as I teach swimming holistically, so do I teach motor development.  I love to use all my resources, playing games, coloring, breathing, dancing, sharing, singing, silence, and more to help children connect to all parts of themselves as one integrated peaceful being.</li>
<li>I am ready!  I am so ready to begin this new journey, and I need help with some funding to begin!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What I need funds for:</h3>
<ul>
<li>$100 for my LLC</li>
<li>About $173 x 2 for two different types of liability insurance: swimming and gymnastics/yoga</li>
<li>$100 for a cover to my underwater camera (what good would swim lessons be without a fun way to document and give back to the parents!?)</li>
<li>$100 for a large animal mat for baby beluga classes and kids to jump off of</li>
<li>A bunch of little things aka manipulatives: kick boards, diving toys, buckets, pool noodles, place markers, frisbees, diving rings, splash bombs, watering cans, etc. for manipulatives that I will use both in and out of the pool - my boss today gave me $100 start on this, so that is good!</li>
<li>Some yoga materials: books, pick-a-card sets, bean bags, and scarves</li>
<li>And I have the rest!  I just bought 6 pairs of flippers, a lot of toys to get started, 8 yoga mats, a collection of kids books and coloring utensils, and I am just about ready to go!  Any help you have to send my way will help me be able to afford this start-up and begin classes in July; Thank you!</li>

<p>Because I have been teaching both of these skills for so long, my start-up is not giant.  I have a good collection of tools already that I can use to begin, and I need just a little nudge to have the start that I desire.  I am so appreciative for anything you can do to help me and any shares you can make to friends you have that you feel may want to support my cause.  I am so excited to make an impact on this world's little people even more so than I have been able to do up until now.  I love children; they are my favorite little creative beings, and I love to build them up with empowerment and imagination.</p>

Не почему — с этим все ясно, или кажется, что ясно, но причин можно найти массу. А вот цель... И если спросить ребят в возрасте от 7 до 17, то можно услышать разное, но, полагаю, «за знаниями» будет где-то в конце рейтинга, если он составлен честно. Эти самые абстрактные «знания» висят над школьником дамокловым мечом все десять лет, ими «пичкают», их оценивают и проверяют, но мало кто из педагогов задается вопросом, что конкретно этот человек будет делать с полученной информацией после экзаменов.<br/><br/><em></em><em></em></p>

<p>«Сложно» равно «трудно»? «Много» равно «скучно»? «Наукообразно» равно «непонятно»? «Нет!» — говорят преподаватели <strong>Зимней Пущинской Школы</strong>. И пусть только на одну неделю, но это действительно становится так. Больше двадцати лет назад учёные наукограда Пущино придумали собирать ребят и рассказывать им о своей работе, о современных представлениях и том, что ещё ждет своих первооткрывателей. Каждый хотел достучаться, донести, передать тот азарт, который не раз испытывал сам и в работе, и в жизни. Учёные они ведь такие: «Наука — это изучение Природы и наслаждение ею. Я ощущаю своё тело, разум, поступки и окружающую меня среду как взаимосвязанное целое. Для меня нет различия между работой и досугом — просто это разные приёмы одной и той же игры», — написал в своей книжке «От мечты к открытию» Ганс Селье слова, под которыми подпишутся многие.<br/><em></em><br/>И ведь получилось! Сначала знакомые и знакомые знакомых, а потом всё больше незнакомых школьников сами стали стремиться провести весенние каникулы с такими же увлеченными людьми. Вскоре выросло целое поколение «зпшовцев»: кто-то, поступив в вуз (и не в абы какой, а как правило, из десятки лучших российских), сам стал преподавать в Школе; некоторые привели уже своих детей; одни уехали, другие уже вернулись; многие просто хранят в памяти атмосферу интеллектуального братства, сотворчества и взаимного интереса — но и это немало! Из чего же, из чего же, из чего же сделана ЗПШ, спросите вы?</p>

<p><br/>Есть курсы (в этом году около 60), методики которых разрабатываются преподавателями специально для Школы, и выбор, куда ходить, делает сам ученик. Есть студии, где после учебного дня можно занять себя всякими любопытными штуковинам вроде плетения фенечек и буриме. Есть команды, собираемые отчасти случайно и разновозрастно, но в процессе общешкольных игр, соревнований и прочих коалиций выясняется, что проявить себя может каждый, причем тогда, когда никто и не ждёт. Здесь не требуют отчёта, не выставляют оценок и не спрашивают, «что хотел сказать автор». На удивление, сам начинаешь понимать, что узнал и насколько хорошо, а главное, зачем.<br/><br/><em>— Эй, пацан, куда стулья потащил? Мы тут из них вообще-то числа Фибоначчи моделируем.</em><br/><em>— А у нас там настоящий робот ходит, и лабиринт уже заканчивается, надо дальше скорее строить. Ну что вам, жалко? </em><br/><em>— Да бери, бери, не канючь только. Там кто-нибудь снимает? Хоть потом посмотреть.</em><br/><br/>Ведь вы не забыли, с чего начался этот разговор? После Школы каждый, будь то Ваня Иванов из 6-го «А» или директор ЗПШ, доктор физико-математических наук, заведующий лабораторией прикладной математики Института прикладной математики РАН, заведующий базовой кафедрой «Яндекс» ВШЭ Михаил Абрамович Ройтберг, может открыть для себя что-то новое. И это не красивые слова, просто попав в животворную среду ЗПШ осознаёшь, как важно доверять себе и окружающим, сколько возможностей таится вокруг нас и как это здорово можно использовать, да что там — прямо-таки кощунственно не использовать!<br/><br/><em>— Простите, можно пару слов для телевидения? У вас такой удивленный и восторженный вид, вы в первый раз на ЗПШ?</em><br/><em>— В шестой.</em><br/><br/>Тех, кто раз в году считает своим долгом осчастливить около 250 детей (и это число растёт), — всего-то около сотни, меньше, чем амурских тигров. Не дайте нам почувствовать себя вымирающим видом — ведь мы не получаем за это зарплату, а частенько раскошеливаемся сами. И ищем спонсоров, гадая, дадут ли денег, хватит ли их, будет ли помещение, компьютеры, канцтовары, жильё и питание, не сорвётся ли всё в последний момент? Пока это каждый раз рулетка, но хочется всё изменить.</p>

И если спросить ребят в возрасте от 7 до 17, то можно услышать разное, но, полагаю, «за знаниями» будет где-то в конце рейтинга, если он составлен честно. Эти самые абстрактные «знания» висят над школьником дамокловым мечом все десять лет, ими «пичкают», их оценивают и проверяют, но мало кто из педагогов задается вопросом, что конкретно этот человек будет делать с полученной информацией после экзаменов.

 

«Сложно» равно «трудно»? «Много» равно «скучно»? «Наукообразно» равно «непонятно»? «Нет!» — говорят преподаватели Зимней Пущинской Школы. И пусть только на одну неделю, но это действительно становится так. Больше двадцати лет назад учёные наукограда Пущино придумали собирать ребят и рассказывать им о своей работе, о современных представлениях и том, что ещё ждет своих первооткрывателей. Каждый хотел достучаться, донести, передать тот азарт, который не раз испытывал сам и в работе, и в жизни. Учёные они ведь такие: «Наука — это изучение Природы и наслаждение ею. Я ощущаю своё тело, разум, поступки и окружающую меня среду как взаимосвязанное целое. Для меня нет различия между работой и досугом — просто это разные приёмы одной и той же игры», — написал в своей книжке «От мечты к открытию» Ганс Селье слова, под которыми подпишутся многие.И ведь получилось! Сначала знакомые и знакомые знакомых, а потом всё больше незнакомых школьников сами стали стремиться провести весенние каникулы с такими же увлеченными людьми. Вскоре выросло целое поколение «зпшовцев»: кто-то, поступив в вуз (и не в абы какой, а как правило, из десятки лучших российских), сам стал преподавать в Школе; некоторые привели уже своих детей; одни уехали, другие уже вернулись; многие просто хранят в памяти атмосферу интеллектуального братства, сотворчества и взаимного интереса — но и это немало! Из чего же, из чего же, из чего же сделана ЗПШ, спросите вы?

...Из заданий,Дураковаляний,Выдумок и состязанийПо шевеленью мозгами.

  

Есть курсы (в этом году около 60), методики которых разрабатываются преподавателями специально для Школы, и выбор, куда ходить, делает сам ученик. Есть студии, где после учебного дня можно занять себя всякими любопытными штуковинам вроде плетения фенечек и буриме. Есть команды, собираемые отчасти случайно и разновозрастно, но в процессе общешкольных игр, соревнований и прочих коалиций выясняется, что проявить себя может каждый, причем тогда, когда никто и не ждёт. Здесь не требуют отчёта, не выставляют оценок и не спрашивают, «что хотел сказать автор». На удивление, сам начинаешь понимать, что узнал и насколько хорошо, а главное, зачем.— Эй, пацан, куда стулья потащил? Мы тут из них вообще-то числа Фибоначчи моделируем.— А у нас там настоящий робот ходит, и лабиринт уже заканчивается, надо дальше скорее строить. Ну что вам, жалко? — Да бери, бери, не канючь только. Там кто-нибудь снимает? Хоть потом посмотреть.Ведь вы не забыли, с чего начался этот разговор? После Школы каждый, будь то Ваня Иванов из 6-го «А» или директор ЗПШ, доктор физико-математических наук, заведующий лабораторией прикладной математики Института прикладной математики РАН, заведующий базовой кафедрой «Яндекс» ВШЭ Михаил Абрамович Ройтберг, может открыть для себя что-то новое. И это не красивые слова, просто попав в животворную среду ЗПШ осознаёшь, как важно доверять себе и окружающим, сколько возможностей таится вокруг нас и как это здорово можно использовать, да что там — прямо-таки кощунственно не использовать!— Простите, можно пару слов для телевидения? У вас такой удивленный и восторженный вид, вы в первый раз на ЗПШ?— В шестой.Тех, кто раз в году считает своим долгом осчастливить около 250 детей (и это число растёт), — всего-то около сотни, меньше, чем амурских тигров. Не дайте нам почувствовать себя вымирающим видом — ведь мы не получаем за это зарплату, а частенько раскошеливаемся сами. И ищем спонсоров, гадая, дадут ли денег, хватит ли их, будет ли помещение, компьютеры, канцтовары, жильё и питание, не сорвётся ли всё в последний момент? Пока это каждый раз рулетка, но хочется всё изменить.

<p>If we’re honest, introductions are always a bit painful and slightly awkward even though they are a necessity in life. I’m not going to make any promises here, but I will do my best to make this as painless as possible and perhaps even slightly enjoyable.</p>
<p>My name, as given on the fantastic little name tag above, is Charlene. Though I grew up in the US, I am now in the UK getting a Master’s degree in <a href=""http://www.uea.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught-degree/detail/ma-cultural-heritage-and-international-development"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cultural Heritage and International Development</a> at the University of East Anglia. This is the point where most people glaze over and simply nod and smile, as they have no clue what I am on about. Let me attempt to alleviate your confusion.</p>
<p>My course is a yearlong program that explores the themes of cultural heritage (what makes up culture, how it is defined, how it can be carried forward for future generations or destroyed), and the complexities of international development (what development is and means, how it is deployed, what countries are considered as developing). The combination of these two ideas means that the bulk of my studies are centred on cultural elements within the developing world.</p>
<p>In particular, the cultural elements I’m studying are archaeological sites that are located within the Middle East. Thus far, I’ve been quite lucky and landed a two-week (self-funded) internship with <a href=""http://www.petranationaltrust.org/UI/Default.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the Petra National Trust</a> – a Jordanian NGO that works with the awe inspiring site of Petra (yes, the same Petra that can be seen in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade). While the internship was amazing, it only provided the basis for the big kahuna – my dissertation (also known as a Master's thesis in the US).</p>
<p>Finally, the reason you are here is revealed!</p>
<p>To complete my degree, I must research and write a dissertation, which is due at the beginning of September. This research, like the internship before it, is also self-funded. Unfortunately, funding for the humanities and travel in general is low, and though I did apply to an educational foundation (<a href=""http://www.spret.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SPRET</a>), the award I received does not even cover the cost of one of my plane tickets.</p>
<p>What exactly is it that I want to do, you ask? Fantastic question!</p>
<p>To complete my dissertation (which has the glaze inducing title of: Culture for sale: Issues in the development of stable management structures and tourism sustainability in tentative UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the Middle East) I need to visit several sites in the Middle East, meet with the site managers (or an NGO working with the site) and discuss what issues they are facing from both management and tourism aspects. Though in some cases, such as Jordan, tourism makes up a large portion of the country’s income, there is a stigma attached to the region that limits the number of visitors. There can also be issues within the local population that cause discourse as well.</p>
<p>The sites I wish to visit are all archaeological and on the <a href=""http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">UNESCO World Heritage Site tentative list</a>. This means that someday they might be listed as a World Heritage Site and see an increase in visitors, which could cause problems if there is not a stable management and tourism structure in place.</p>
<h3><strong>Let’s break down the specifics, shall we?</strong></h3>
<p>I am asking for donations to help fund the travel and research portion of my dissertation. Not to worry, I will do all the heavy lifting and writing myself!</p>
<p>My trip will include visits to Jordan (Jerash Archaeological City), United Arab Emirates (Al Bidya Mosque and Ed-Dur Site), and Qatar (Al-Zubarah town), lasting approximately two weeks in total. Originally, the trip was scheduled to take place in June, until I received the bad news regarding my funding. It has now been pushed to July and though it will be hot, I will gladly make it work.</p>
<p>Travel includes (all Round Trip):</p>
<ul>
<li>Transportation from Norwich, UK, to London, UK</li>
<li>Airfare - Amman, Jordan/London, UK (Booking this one with easyJet to help lower the cost!)</li>
<li>Airfare – Amman, Jordan/Dubai, UAE</li>
<li>Airfare – Dubai, UAE/Doha, Qatar</li>
<li>Transportation while in Jordan, UAE, and Qatar</li>
</ul><p>Value: £1,100</p>
<p>Other expenses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Food – essential to life</li>
<li>Lodging (No Four Seasons, I promise!!)</li>
</ul><p>Value: £900</p>
<p>Please note that this campaign is in US dollars, though my value estimates are in Pounds. This was done to make donations and the receipt of funds much less painful. In addition, this campaign gives me the funds regardless of the goal being reached. How then, will I spend the funds if I cannot afford the entire trip? Depending on the amount reached, I will adjust my travel and research. Funds will not go unused or to assist in the purchase of a pair of Jimmy Choos!</p>
<p>This research is incredibly important for both the completion of my degree and for archaeological sites that are facing management and sustainability issues. I do hope to continue my career in the heritage sector in the Middle East and this is one of the steps required to get me there.</p>
<p>Anyone who contributes will receive a sincere thank you note, a post card from my travels, and my eternal gratitude!</p>
<h3>But wait, there’s more!!</h3>
<p>I do realise that not everyone can donate funds, which is beyond understandable. If this is the case, there are still a few things you can do to help me (you too will also receive my eternal gratitude):</p>
<ul>
<li>Donate airline miles or hotel points: I am a United Airlines fan and could convert any miles or hotel points which were donated to help either pay for or lower the cost of my travel.</li>

I help integrate them into college and the community where they focus on independent living, community services, campus engagement, self determination, career development, &amp; academic enrichment.</p>
<p><br/><br/><strong>These students are not </strong>qualified for Bright Futures, Pell Grants, or student loans. This campaign hopes to raise enough money to cover tuition for those students who need the extra help.

<p><strong>Many colleges are  leading the way</strong> in providing robust alternatives to outdated approaches to special education.

This postsecondary movement, which values inclusion and equal opportunity, is reforming special education on campuses across the state.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>College courses are not cheap.</strong> </strong>With the cost of tuition and books forever rising, many students are facing difficult choices regarding their future on college campuses across the nation.</p>

I mentor adults with intellectual disabilities. I help integrate them into college and the community where they focus on independent living, community services, campus engagement, self determination, career development, & academic enrichment.
These students are not qualified for Bright Futures, Pell Grants, or student loans. This campaign hopes to raise enough money to cover tuition for those students who need the extra help. Students meet with mentors, work on their reading and math skills, hold on and off campus internships, and audit college level courses.
  
Many colleges are  leading the way in providing robust alternatives to outdated approaches to special education. The students I work with show tremendous growth in their abilities & character. This postsecondary movement, which values inclusion and equal opportunity, is reforming special education on campuses across the state.
 
College courses are not cheap. With the cost of tuition and books forever rising, many students are facing difficult choices regarding their future on college campuses across the nation.
 
Your support will help pay for tuition & fees, textbooks, and will supplement any other unexpected costs students are not able to pay.
 
Even if you cannot contribute financially, you can still be a positive force in these students' lives. Sharing this campaign with your friends is a good place to start. I am so grateful for your support.

About the campaign:
Have you seen these subway station ads?


 

These ads attack our most basic communal values: they try to exploit the city’s grief and anger over 9/11, and they demonize and intimidate members of a particular religious group. 
 

That's not how we roll. Everyone has a right to feel at home in this city, and that includes our Muslim neighbors.




Don't let hate get the last word.
If you chip in, 
We'll buy our own ads—

and run them in as many stations as we can.



In just two weeks, we raised $7,500, to get started with ads in ten subway stations. We've gotten great press to amplify our voices, so the whole world will hear our response. 

 
Official design for the first poster! 

 
How can you be a part of it? 
We need your help to pay for the ads. You can also contribute your message to the campaign. See the perks on the right-hand sidebar.


Other ways to help: Even if you can't pitch in, you can help spread the word by telling your friends, family, and anyone else you know!

He fractured his neck at C1-C2 and his back at T4-T5-T6. Three days after the accident, doctors talked with us about removing him from life support as they thought his chances for survival were slim. Not wanting to make a quick decision, my wife and I decided to take a ""wait and see"" approach. The very next day, Jamison woke up and was fully cognitive even though he had suffered some swelling of his brain. Doctors gave him little chance of regaining any movement and had low expectations for his life expectancy. He was at UAB hospital in the ICU for a little over a month before we had him transferred to The Shepherd Center in Atlanta. He transferred into the ICU there. The Shepherd Center is a hospital that specializes in spinal cord injuries. Doctors at The Shepherd Center had little hope of his regaining any movement as well, until he wiggled his big toe on his left foot. Then he became able to to squeeze his thighs together a little. He then gained slight movement in his left arm and then his right. While most of the movement has noy become functional, his right arm has grown stronger and he can now move it a little back and forth and up and down. He can now barely pick his right arm up and put it in his lap.</h3>
<h3>While we have private insurance coverage for him, there have been so many expenses that have not been covered. Our savings, retirement, and children's college funds are now gone.</h3>
<h3>We are raising funds to get him a WREX exoskeleton arm that will help him regain some functional use of his right arm.

I cant afford to send perks for donations as seems common on this site but your contribution, in any way that you can contribute, would be greatly appreciated. It is hard for my family and I to seek out help as we have always been givers by nature and being the ones needing help is very humbling.

<h3>FREE PERKS!</h3>
<div>I now say thank you to the challenges, because each one makes me wiser and stronger.  I am by no means where I want to be, but I am enjoying the journey.  I ACTUALLY LOVE WHAT I DO, AND HOW I DO IT!</div>
<div>That is why I'm asking you to please don't be shy!  <b>TWEET YOUR REQUEST </b>to<b> @angelicaross with the hashtag #MissRoss </b>and tell me which perk you would like and I will do my best to give you what I have to give.  I am looking to go to Life Coach Training so that I can give more efficiently, and become a better me in the process.  You are welcome to come a long with me on the journey.  As I learn better, I will do better, and I will pass it on.  Please consider donating even $1 just to say, I support you, and I will genuinely be grateful, and am willing to publicly thank you for your support.</div>
<p>The calling came to me sitting in the church pews as a child.  A call I was afraid to ignore, but more afraid to answer.  Why me?  Who would listen to me?  I was told I was an abomination, and that my path would lead me straight to hell, which it did.  I have been through hell and now I'm back with a message for those who are suffering through their own version hell.  I currently work as an Employment Program Coordinator and provide career coaching for transgender, gender non-conforming, and cisgender individuals.  With a foundation in Buddhism as well as A Course in Miracles, I want to expand and begin to focus on Life and Spiritual Coaching.  I want to formalize my skills to help others see the value in ALL of life, even the painful parts.  I aim to help shift a perspective of fear to love and courage.  I have watched my life unfold in divine order, and I am grateful for the lessons, and wish to use some of those lessons as my #LifeClass as Oprah would put it.  With your help, after completing the Life Coach Training I will be certified and will receive credentials from the International Coach Federation.</p>

<h3>Who We Are!</h3>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">WordWorks! is a creative writing lab based in Lynchburg, Virginia.  </span><br/></p>
<p><i>Our Mission</i></p>
<p>WordWorks! provides creative and expository writing skill support to K-12 students and their teachers.  Through after-school tutoring, workshops, student publications and in-school programs, our services are structured around the ideas that individual attention can spark great leaps in learning and that solid writing skills are a building block for future success.<br/></p>
<p><i>Our Vision</i></p>
<p>Challenging and fun, our programs are designed to foster a love of language and give young people the power to express ideas effectively, creatively, confidently, and in their individual voices while at the same time teaching the critical thinking and communication skills necessary to be a successful and contributing adult.  With this in mind and with the generous help of volunteers and educational professionals, WordWorks! provides all of its services free of charge.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>But How Do You Do All That?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>How, you ask?  Through writing workshops, individualized attention to student needs and regularly publishing the work of our young authors.  Also by liberally using zombies, superhero animals, the magic of telepathic writing powers and monthly haiku competitions as inspiration.  (Never underestimate the power of a nicely worded haiku.)</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need!</h3>
<p></p>
<p>With our Fall Fundraising Spectacular we hope to raise money for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publishing our Summer Anthology, a collection of over one hundred stories and poems written by children participating in our summer workshops.</li>
<li>Establishing an in-house lending library of age appropriate and culturally relevant reading materials.</li>
<li>Snacks!  Because after school, children are hungry and it is always easier to write when your belly is full.</li>
<li>Pencils, paper, crayons, glue, tape, markers, staples, etc; instruments critical to any serious creative endeavor and which all seem to get used at a fantastic rate of speed.</li>
<li>Electricity!  Because writing in the dark, while not impossible, is very very difficult.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">WordWorks! provides of all of its services free of charge so that every child always has the ability to participate.  We rely wholly on the generosity of volunteers who donate their time and energy to help teach our workshops.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Having grown up with my mother who's artistic endavours knows no boundaries she nurtured my own passion for the arts. From this encouragement and my own fervor, I completed my honours degree in fine arts, with a minor in art history, from Queens University, Kingston On. </p>
<p>Upon completing my degree, I wished to expand my knowledge and understanding of art as an object in regards to preventative and restorative conservation. This led me to my current program of study, Applied Museum Studies. In accordance with the program requirements I am to complete a four month long internship. </p>
<p>I Have been accepted as an intern with the National Gallery of Ireland for art conservation. By donating to this campaign it will help me gain experience in a field I hope to pursue at a masters level and as my future career.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As this is an unpaid internship, and a course requirement, I am unable to gain financially via this internship, and am still required to pay tuition fees. The aid brought about through this campaign will help me with airfare, room and board during the placement.   </p>
<p>The perks will be clips and photographs of both Dublin city and the work undertaken by me at the Gallery. </p>
<p>short video clips will be taken of exciting events and famous monuments within the exciting city of Dublin. In addition pen, pastel, silkscreen and lithograph prints will be given out as a perk, all of them having been created by me over the past few years. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The field of cultural heritage and the preservation of it is an invaluable one. The artefacts preserved within institutions such as the National Gallery of Ireland, help facilitate a greater understanding of various parts of history, whether it be our own or not.</p>
<p>It is crucial that future generations are trained to care for our fine art collections and artefacts inorder to preserve the history and historical significance attached to said objects. Through this placement I hope to learn and gain practical experience in theories and techniques for the preservation of fine art in order to maintain historical and culturally significant artefacts. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>                I started making murals with young people around 5 years ago. It has become a passion in my life at this point. I am so inspired by the young people I work with, their excitement and energy for working to create something beautiful in their community. I have done projects in Newburgh, NY, where I currently am an art teacher, and have traveled to Belize and Ecuador to work with young people to create murals in their communities.</p>
<p>               It is extremely challenging and intimidating walking into a community other than my own, especially in a culture other than mine,  and to embark on an artistic journey of creation with young people I don’t know and who don’t know me. Working together requires trust, but this leap of faith has time and again yielded a wonderful result both in both the process and the product. When young people create something larger than themselves, they learn firsthand about the power of community. It’s a valuable and inspirational lesson.</p>
<p>          The projects I have done in Newburgh and Belize were completely independently conceived of and realized by me. The projects in Ecuador were done in tandem with One World Classrooms, a non-profit organization whose mission is to foster cross-cultural communication through the arts and technology, between schools in the United States and schools in countries around the world. The trips I have taken have changed my life in that they have taught me that art making is universal and bridges language and culture.</p>
<p>       I believe these projects have in a small way changed the lives of the young people involved .This year I would like to travel to Windhoek, Namibia, with One World Classrooms, to create a mural with young people. I am trying to raise $2000 so that I can pay for my plane tickets and expenses while I am there. Your contribution no matter how small, will help to keep these projects alive. Please consider donating.</p>

I'm Shauna Aura Knight, and for the past years I've traveled the US and Canada teaching leadership, community building, public speaking, ritual facilitation, and personal growth work., but I need help to keep doing this work.</p><p>My primary audience has been the Pagan/Earth-centered/Alternative spirituality communities and other artistic and activist groups. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Grassroots leaders have a tough job; we step into leadership without a lot of training, and when our groups blow up, we don't know what went wrong.</span><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><i> I dream of healthy, vital grassroots groups and Pagan communities. </i></b><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><i>I have worked to make leadership training more broadly available.</i></b></p><p>My challenge: in following this calling, I've taught for many groups that couldn't afford to pay me much. Often I even paid gas money out of my own pocket to be able to travel and teach without pay. In the past years I've spent more in car repairs than I've ever earned in class fees. This has left me without any financial buffer. </p><p>Recently, my car was totaled in an accident that wasn't my fault, however I won't receive any settlement toward a new car. <b><i>This has left me without any way to get to the conferences, festivals, and events where I've agreed to teach leadership. </i></b></p><p>I'm stuck in a Catch-22. I live in a rural area in order to minimize my expenses so I can focus on writing and teaching. Without a car, I can't get to any of my upcoming teaching engagements. There aren't even viable jobs within walking distance of me. I've sacrificed so many creature comforts in order to bring the leadership work out to the world, but now I need help to continue offering leadership training. </p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>

I'm Shauna Aura Knight, and for the past years I've traveled the US and Canada teaching leadership, community building, public speaking, ritual facilitation, and personal growth work., but I need help to keep doing this work.My primary audience has been the Pagan/Earth-centered/Alternative spirituality communities and other artistic and activist groups. Grassroots leaders have a tough job; we step into leadership without a lot of training, and when our groups blow up, we don't know what went wrong. I dream of healthy, vital grassroots groups and Pagan communities. I have worked to make leadership training more broadly available.My challenge: in following this calling, I've taught for many groups that couldn't afford to pay me much. Often I even paid gas money out of my own pocket to be able to travel and teach without pay. In the past years I've spent more in car repairs than I've ever earned in class fees. This has left me without any financial buffer. Recently, my car was totaled in an accident that wasn't my fault, however I won't receive any settlement toward a new car. This has left me without any way to get to the conferences, festivals, and events where I've agreed to teach leadership. I'm stuck in a Catch-22. I live in a rural area in order to minimize my expenses so I can focus on writing and teaching. Without a car, I can't get to any of my upcoming teaching engagements. There aren't even viable jobs within walking distance of me. I've sacrificed so many creature comforts in order to bring the leadership work out to the world, but now I need help to continue offering leadership training. 
Raising Funds: I'm looking to raise enough money for a car so I can continue to travel and teach leadership. Optimally that's about $6,000, though I could buy a less reliable vehicle for about $2,000.I have listed more extensive details at the bottom of the page about my specific goals and what work I will do including some cool ""stretch"" goals if I surpass $5,000. While more than 75% of my mileage is from traveling for teaching or running Pagan events in Chicago, having a car also allows me to sell my artwork and bring in other freelance income that will in turn allow me to fund future leadership training work and resources like videos. In addition, I hope to raise additional  for my living expenses in order to have the time to finish writing several books on leadership and facilitation, or even create videos and recordings to offer further resources to people who cannot travel to attend leadership classes in person.You can help me achieve more leadership education. I believe that it is crucial for grassroots groups to have access to leadership and facilitation skills in order to do the work that calls to them. Help me keep building stronger leaders and stronger communities.If you haven't heard of me before and want to know where your money would be going to, you can learn more about me at: http://www.ShaunaAuraKnight.com/about or you can read some of my leadership blog posts at  https://shaunaaura.wordpress.com or my environmental and other activism posts at http://paganactivist.com/author/shaunaaura/You can also take a look at my currently published books. http://www.shaunaauraknight.com/books/
What You GetI'm offering some cool things in return for your generosity. I certainly welcome donations from folks who have benefited from my writing and leadership training in the past, and those who want others to benefit in the future.I think one of the cool parts of an Indiegogo campaign is the ability to offer you—my supporters--some tangible, nifty perks that tie into the work that I’ve already done, and that further community building work that I hope to continue doingPerks Include:
MP3 files of chants and guided Trance Journeys, 
eBooks and hardcopies of my collected articles and blog posts on Leadership and Ritual Facilitation,
Perks also include one-on-one or small-group Skype calls with me to talk through leadership issues,
I'll write articles or do a Youtube video on leadership topics of your choice,
My own artwork and digital collage images, or having me come to town to paint a mural in your home or even having me build a shrine in your back yard or other installation,
Bringing bringing me to town to teach workshops, or even having me help you organize a leadership conference in your area. 
Check out some of my artwork if interested in those perks:Watercolors: http://shaunaknightarts.wordpress.com/fantasy-paintings/Mythic Mixed Media: http://shaunaknightarts.wordpress.com/mythic-mixed-media/Digital collage Images: https://www.etsy.com/shop/ShaunaAuraKnightA note about the perks:Paintings will be given away as perks on a ""first come first served"" basis, however, if a particular painting is sold, I can either paint another one that is similar, or prints may also be available. Items from the digital goodie packs will be available in early March. Physical items such as paintings that I have on hand will be shipped early April at the latest. If your perk includes custom work, that may take longer.If you choose one of the perks that involve my travel, we will arrange for a time that works best, this year or next year. For any of the perks where I'm traveling out of town, pricing reflects the assumption that I'll be staying in a spare room locally. We'll need to negotiate specifics--for instance, I need to stay in a smoke-free space. Please feel free to contact me with questions if you are thinking about selecting one of these perks. ShaunaAura (at) gmail DOT com. *Perks such as the installation art and conference planning do not include things like extensive supply costs or renting venues or paying for other event costs. Contact me if you want to talk shop on your vision and how I can help make that happen for you.**I reserve the right to turn any of those gigs down based on the creepy factor. It's only happened once or twice, but I have had people that hit high on my creepy scale invite me to stay with them and teach and I've had to say no.The ImpactWe need healthier communities. Whatever your spiritual background, whatever your particular interests...you are doing work that matters, and I want to help you grow stronger, healthier groups. Sometimes leaders need help figuring out group dynamics, or be a better public speaker, or how to facilitate a workshop or a ritual. There are so many challenges to small group leadership and most volunteer leaders can't afford to spend the time and the money to take college-level leadership classes or attend expensive seminars. For that matter, most leadership classes don't address the special needs of grassroots groups. I want to help more communities succeed. I want to see us change the world, build a healthier, beautiful world of cooperation and connection. I've seen the positive impact of my leadership work when I travel and teach and I want to help grow more leaders and more teachers.Let me help you build stronger communities.Other Ways You Can HelpMoney is tight for many folks, and I of all people get that. There are lots of cool fundraisers I'd love to donate to myself! I want to let you know that truly, $1 or $5 really does make a difference. However, other ways you can help include getting the word out about this campaign. with Indiegogo's sharing tools, or you can:

<p>La historia
de la Astronomía en México es tan antigua como la historia del país. En 1847,
cuando México era una nación nueva, recién liberado del gobierno español,
surgió el primer intento de establecer un observatorio moderno. Sin embargo,
este observatorio fue destruido por un bombardeo del ejercito de los Estados
Unidos durante la intervención estadounidense en México. Esto, afortunadamente,
hizo poco por desmotivar el interés de la gente mexicana por la Astronomía.</p>
<p>Posteriormente
en 1867 con la colaboración de Francisco Díaz Covarrubias (1833-1889);
geógrafo, ingeniero, conocido científico y educador, se dio el establecimiento
de un modesto observatorio en el techo del Palacio Nacional. Así, la Astronomía
en México comienza a ganar impulso y en 1874 México participa en la observación
del “Tránsito de Venus” en Japón.</p>
<p style="""">México
contribuyó con precisas observaciones que fueron utilizadas para establecer la
distancia entre el Sol y la Tierra y las dimensiones del Sistema Solar, el
éxito de este evento fue tal que motivó la creación del Anuario Astronómico Nacional
en 1881. Y es en 1902 que un nuevo capítulo de la historia astronómica fue abierto
y la Sociedad Astronómica de México fue fundada. Desde entonces, la Sociedad ha
motivado a muchas personas a acercarse a la ciencia a través de la divulgación
de la Astronomía. Con el pasar de los años la SAM creció en tamaño e
importancia, a tal grado que logró tener tres importantes edificios. Los cuales
incluyeron el primer planetario de América latina, un importante Observatorio
Astronómico en Chapa de México (estado de México); la SAM llegó a tener cerca
de mil socios activos.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/260849/files/20131214140236-Edificio_de_la_SAM.jpg?1387058556"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p align=""center""><i>Edificio principal donde se encuentra el primer planetario de México.</i><br/></p><span></span><p></p><p></p>
<p>Sin embargo,
en los últimos 20 años debido a las diversas crisis económicas en México y el
Mundo, y junto con una pobre administración, la Sociedad perdió fuerza y casi
desaparece. Sus instalaciones fueron dañadas por el paso del tiempo hasta el
grado de no ser funcionales (aún así la SAM no ha cerrado sus puertas por
completo).</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/258092/files/20131212165231-DSC05690.JPG?1386895951"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p align=""center""><i>Años sin mantenimiento, este es el estado del interior del edificio.</i><br/></p><p></p>
<p>Hace un par
de años, los socios de la SAM empezaron a trabajar activamente para revivirla y
lograr que su objetivo principal se siga cumpliendo: divulgar la Astronomía,
Ciencia y Tecnología. Por eso, la meta actual, es poder restaurar por completo
nuestro planetario y volverlo sustentable y funcional de nuevo.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/259130/files/20131213092228-SAM_foto_1.jpg?1386955348"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p align=""center""><i>Imagen del planetario Spitz en los ochentas.</i><br/></p><p></p>

<p><b>¡Qué necesitamos y como utilizaremos el dinero! </b></p>
<p>Actualmente
la SAM no cuenta con ningún tipo de apoyo económico ni financiamiento. El poco
dinero que obtiene es por la contribución de los miembros y de los varios cursos
y talleres que organiza. Este dinero es apenas suficiente para pagar los gastos
básicos y definitivamente no es suficiente para restaurar nuestro planetario.
Este planetario es el más antiguo de México y el primero de Latino América,
tiene un significado importante y hoy día está prácticamente desmantelado. Los
donativos que recibamos serán utilizados para reconstruir y equipar el
planetario, UN PLANETARIO que nos pertenezca a todos. Las tareas específicas a
realizar son:</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Comprar e instalar el piso.</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Comprar e instalar aislamiento acústico en las paredes.</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Adquirir asientos reclinables para el planetario.</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Arreglar el domo.</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Instalar equipo de audio.</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Comprar e instalar un nuevo proyector digital.</p>
<p>El proyector
digital será utilizado en conjunto con el proyector antiguo, el cual sigue
trabajando y en muy buenas condiciones. La reconstrucción de este planetario es
muy importante, no tan solo para la SAM, sino también para promocionar
ampliamente la ciencia y cultura en México.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/259124/files/20131213092123-SAM_foto_2.jpg?1386955283"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div align=""center"">

<p><b>El
Impacto de tu contribución</b></p>
<p>Hoy día
existen pocos planetarios con infraestructura moderna y abiertos al público
general que trabajen en México, mismos que no son ni cercanamente suficientes
para dar servicio ni siquiera a la población de la Ciudad de México. La
reapertura de nuestro planetario permitirá a muchas más personas acercarse a la
Astronomía, Ciencia y Cultura en general. Uno de nuestros propósitos y
compromisos que tendrá un fuerte impacto, es que una vez abierto el planetario,
la SAM ofrecerá funciones gratuitas a todas las escuelas interesadas que lo
soliciten.</p>
<p><b>Otras
Maneras en las que Puedes Ayudar</b></p>
<p>La SAM
agradecerá cualquier tipo de ayuda sin importar de quien proceda. Puede ser
trabajo voluntario, ayuda dando cursos o pláticas, o simplemente promoviendo y
compartiendo esta iniciativa a través de su red social favorita. No dude en
contactarnos si está interesado en alguna forma alternativa de ayudar a esta
noble causa.</p><p><b>Retribuciones:</b><br/></p>

<h2>Short Summary</h2><p><span>The History of Astronomy in Mexico is as old as the history of the country. In 1847, with Mexico freshly liberated from the Spanish government, the first attempt to establish a modern observatory was made, this observatory was later destroyed by the bombing of the united states army during the mexican-american war. This, however, did little to discourage the interest of the Mexican people in astronomy.<br/><br/>During 1867 with the collaboration of Francisco Díaz Covarrubias (1833-1889); geographical engineer and reknown scientist and educator, the establishment of a modest observatory on the roof of the National Palace was made possible.

In 1902 a new chapter in the astronomical history of the country was opened and the Astronomical Society of Mexico (SAM due to its name in spanish: <i>Sociedad Astronómica de México</i>) was founded. Since then, the society has motivated many people to get closer to science through the divulgation of astronomy. Throughout the years the astronomical society grew both in size and importance, to a point where it had control over three important buildings, which included the first planetarium in latin america, an important astronomical observatory in Chapa de Mota (Estado de México) and close to 1000 active members.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 5px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/260849/files/20131214140236-Edificio_de_la_SAM.jpg?1387058556"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""color: #666; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: italic; width: 100%; text-align: center; margin-top: 0px;""><span>Main building of SAM, inside the first planetarium in Mexico<br/></span></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><span>However, during the last 20 years, various economic crises in Mexico and the world and with very poor management the society lost strength and almost fell apart.

Resumen en Español
La historia
de la Astronomía en México es tan antigua como la historia del país. En 1847,
cuando México era una nación nueva, recién liberado del gobierno español,
surgió el primer intento de establecer un observatorio moderno. Sin embargo,
este observatorio fue destruido por un bombardeo del ejercito de los Estados
Unidos durante la intervención estadounidense en México. Esto, afortunadamente,
hizo poco por desmotivar el interés de la gente mexicana por la Astronomía.
Posteriormente
en 1867 con la colaboración de Francisco Díaz Covarrubias (1833-1889);
geógrafo, ingeniero, conocido científico y educador, se dio el establecimiento
de un modesto observatorio en el techo del Palacio Nacional. Así, la Astronomía
en México comienza a ganar impulso y en 1874 México participa en la observación
del “Tránsito de Venus” en Japón.
México
contribuyó con precisas observaciones que fueron utilizadas para establecer la
distancia entre el Sol y la Tierra y las dimensiones del Sistema Solar, el
éxito de este evento fue tal que motivó la creación del Anuario Astronómico Nacional
en 1881. Y es en 1902 que un nuevo capítulo de la historia astronómica fue abierto
y la Sociedad Astronómica de México fue fundada. Desde entonces, la Sociedad ha
motivado a muchas personas a acercarse a la ciencia a través de la divulgación
de la Astronomía. Con el pasar de los años la SAM creció en tamaño e
importancia, a tal grado que logró tener tres importantes edificios. Los cuales
incluyeron el primer planetario de América latina, un importante Observatorio
Astronómico en Chapa de México (estado de México); la SAM llegó a tener cerca
de mil socios activos.Edificio principal donde se encuentra el primer planetario de México.
Sin embargo,
en los últimos 20 años debido a las diversas crisis económicas en México y el
Mundo, y junto con una pobre administración, la Sociedad perdió fuerza y casi
desaparece. Sus instalaciones fueron dañadas por el paso del tiempo hasta el
grado de no ser funcionales (aún así la SAM no ha cerrado sus puertas por
completo).Años sin mantenimiento, este es el estado del interior del edificio.
Hace un par
de años, los socios de la SAM empezaron a trabajar activamente para revivirla y
lograr que su objetivo principal se siga cumpliendo: divulgar la Astronomía,
Ciencia y Tecnología. Por eso, la meta actual, es poder restaurar por completo
nuestro planetario y volverlo sustentable y funcional de nuevo.Imagen del planetario Spitz en los ochentas.

¡Qué necesitamos y como utilizaremos el dinero! 
Actualmente
la SAM no cuenta con ningún tipo de apoyo económico ni financiamiento. El poco
dinero que obtiene es por la contribución de los miembros y de los varios cursos
y talleres que organiza. Este dinero es apenas suficiente para pagar los gastos
básicos y definitivamente no es suficiente para restaurar nuestro planetario.
Este planetario es el más antiguo de México y el primero de Latino América,
tiene un significado importante y hoy día está prácticamente desmantelado. Los
donativos que recibamos serán utilizados para reconstruir y equipar el
planetario, UN PLANETARIO que nos pertenezca a todos. Las tareas específicas a
realizar son:
- 
Comprar e instalar el piso.
- 
Comprar e instalar aislamiento acústico en las paredes.
- 
Adquirir asientos reclinables para el planetario.
- 
Arreglar el domo.
- 
Instalar equipo de audio.
- 
Comprar e instalar un nuevo proyector digital.
El proyector
digital será utilizado en conjunto con el proyector antiguo, el cual sigue
trabajando y en muy buenas condiciones. La reconstrucción de este planetario es
muy importante, no tan solo para la SAM, sino también para promocionar
ampliamente la ciencia y cultura en México.
Estado actual del Planetario y de su Domo.

El
Impacto de tu contribución
Hoy día
existen pocos planetarios con infraestructura moderna y abiertos al público
general que trabajen en México, mismos que no son ni cercanamente suficientes
para dar servicio ni siquiera a la población de la Ciudad de México. La
reapertura de nuestro planetario permitirá a muchas más personas acercarse a la
Astronomía, Ciencia y Cultura en general. Uno de nuestros propósitos y
compromisos que tendrá un fuerte impacto, es que una vez abierto el planetario,
la SAM ofrecerá funciones gratuitas a todas las escuelas interesadas que lo
soliciten.
Otras
Maneras en las que Puedes Ayudar
La SAM
agradecerá cualquier tipo de ayuda sin importar de quien proceda. Puede ser
trabajo voluntario, ayuda dando cursos o pláticas, o simplemente promoviendo y
compartiendo esta iniciativa a través de su red social favorita. No dude en
contactarnos si está interesado en alguna forma alternativa de ayudar a esta
noble causa.Retribuciones:

Resumen en Inglés


Short SummaryThe History of Astronomy in Mexico is as old as the history of the country. In 1847, with Mexico freshly liberated from the Spanish government, the first attempt to establish a modern observatory was made, this observatory was later destroyed by the bombing of the united states army during the mexican-american war. This, however, did little to discourage the interest of the Mexican people in astronomy.During 1867 with the collaboration of Francisco Díaz Covarrubias (1833-1889); geographical engineer and reknown scientist and educator, the establishment of a modest observatory on the roof of the National Palace was made possible. Astronomy in Mexico started to gain momentum and in 1874 Mexico participated in the observation of the ""Transit of Venus"" in Japan.Mexico contributed with precise observations that were used to establish the Sun-Earth distance and the dimensions of the solar system, the success of this event led to the creation of the Mexican Observatory Yearbook, published yearly since 1881. In 1902 a new chapter in the astronomical history of the country was opened and the Astronomical Society of Mexico (SAM due to its name in spanish: Sociedad Astronómica de México) was founded. Since then, the society has motivated many people to get closer to science through the divulgation of astronomy. Throughout the years the astronomical society grew both in size and importance, to a point where it had control over three important buildings, which included the first planetarium in latin america, an important astronomical observatory in Chapa de Mota (Estado de México) and close to 1000 active members.Main building of SAM, inside the first planetarium in MexicoHowever, during the last 20 years, various economic crises in Mexico and the world and with very poor management the society lost strength and almost fell apart. Its facilities were damaged by the passing of time until they were not fully functional anymore (even through all this, the SAM has never closed it's doors completely).Years without maintenance this is the state of the interior of the buildingUntil a couple of years ago, when new SAM members started to actively work on reviving and getting the society to fulfill its primary objective again: to divulge  astronomy, science and technology. The goal now, is to be able to fully restore our planetarium and thus become self sustained and functional again.Image showing the planetary Spitz later in the 80s
Perks for your contribution


What We Need and How the Money will be UsedCurrently, the SAM does not have economic aid or funding of any sort. The
little money there is comes from member contributions and from the
 various courses and workshops organized by the society. It is barely enough to pay the bills and definitely not enough to restore our
 planetarium. This planetarium is the oldest in Mexico and the first in Latin America, it has an important historical significance and yet it is practically dismantled. The donations we receive will be used to build and equip the planetarium, a planetarium that will belong to all of us. The specific tasks to be performed are:- Purchase and install the floor.- Buy and install acoustic insulation for the walls.- Acquire reclining seats for the planetarium.- Fix the dome.- Install audio equipment.- Buy and install a new digital projector.The digital projector will be used in conjunction with the old mechanical projector, which is still working and in very good conditions. Rebuilding this planetarium is very important, not only for the society, but for the widespread promotion of science and culture in Mexico.Current status of the planetarium and dome
The Impact of Your ContributionCurrently there are a few working planetariums in Mexico with modern infrastructure and open to the public, but they are not nearly enough to service the large population of the city, much less of the country. The reopening of our planetarium will allow a lot more people to get closer to astronomy, science and culture in general. One of our objectives and commitments that will have a strong impact, is that once the planetarium is restored, the SAM will be open for free planetarium programs to all interested schools.

<strong>The Jewish Community:</strong> Young professionals with an increased desire to

Invest in Israel, Internships & Jewish Camp. The Cohen Camps, a family of three Jewish camps in New England, invest deeply in their campers and staff. Our oldest campers can cap off their experience with our immensely popular Dor L'Dor (DLD) leadership program, a five-week leadership training program which combines Israel travel with CIT camp counselor experience. Now we're taking DLD to the next level:Our Camp counselors want to return to camp as counselors during college, and we want them to do so: they bring enormous energy and experience to our campers. And yet these young leaders face enormous pressure to secure internships that will make them more marketable after college. To meet this challenge, the Cohen Camps is pioneering a new initiative:  Dor L'Dor: College Style. In collaboration with the well-regarded Onward Israel program, a program of the Jewish Agency for Israel (JAFI), Dor L'Dor will be able to offer a professional Israel internship program, designed just for Cohen Camps college-age counselors, followed by a full summer of a higher-level camp job. It's a seamless way to have it all: global work experience, a deeper connection to Israel, and a summer job that benefits both the student and the campers. Simply put, Dor L'Dor College Style is an entirely new concept in Jewish camping and education, invented by the Cohen Camps but already being looked at as a model by others.

Partnering with Onward Israel, 9 - 12 participants, all DLD graduates selected on the basis of their applications, will train in five-week intensive internships in Israel in May-June 2014, combining their work with high level learning and Israel engagement activities.  

These participants will then return to New England in time for staff orientation to work for the summer at their Camp as a veteran counselor.

What We Need & What You Get With any new start-up there are often a few hurdles to overcome. Our main challenge is funding. The Cohen Camps need to raise an initial investment of $18,000 to make this program a reality. This investment helps cover the costs of staff, program planning, identifying great internships and making placement matches.
Of course, this isn't the full cost; the remainder of the program costs is being shared by Onward Israel and other donors.The more funding, the more counselors who can participate. With a minimum of $18,000, we can launch an entirely new kind of internship and training program for nine college-aged counselors. All funds raised go directly to fund DLD: College Style.We've got some great perks to offer as a thank you for your investment! These include a video diary, a group video chat with our interns (from Israel), and a Shabbat lunch at a camp with the counselors after they return. You can see a list of all the perks along the right-hand side of this page.The Known ImpactWe know that:

Veteran counselors help establish continuity, traditions and model high level camper/counselor relationships.
The first trip to Israel opens the door and forges a connection to Israel. The second touch deepens the connection and builds a solid foundation. 
Our college students need 21st-Century skills and global work experience to get the jobs they want after graduation. We want to help.
The Impact:
The Participants: Job marketability and skills, while retaining the opportunity to participate in Jewish Overnight Camping.

Cohen Camps : A cohort of veteran counselors who will return to work at camp and ensure continuity and traditions as well as become a role model for staff and campers.

Jewish Overnight Camping: this program will become a model for other camps, whose college counselors are all facing the same counselor vs. internship dilemma.

The Jewish Community: Young professionals with an increased desire to 
connect and contribute to the greater Jewish community as a result of this unique program. Inspired by their second touch to Israel, this cohort of 
counselors will transition from being a college student to a young 
professional with a deeper connection to Israel. 
BONUS:Our Israel intern counselors will meet the Israeli-resident counselors the Cohen Camps hire to work at the Camps. The interns will benefit from having peers in Israel to help them acclimate, while the Israeli counselors will come to Camp knowing their fellow counselors.  Ways You Can HelpPlease donate!

<p>Hello, I have created this fundraiser to help open the doors to Dragon Phoenix School of Internal Martial Arts. Martial arts found me when I was a teenager and it has always felt like an element that has helped me in many ways and is meant to be a part of me. Recently I've found why that is and why all of my travels have led me to where I am. This is why I will open a martial arts school that focuses on helping people to feel better in the mind and the body. </p>
<p>I will open this school beginning in September of this year. It will be a struggle, but I am putting in everything that I have to make it happen, and it will succeed. There are some upfront costs that will be difficult. This is why I created this fundraiser. If you are willing to help me with some of the initial startup costs I would be more than grateful.</p>
<p>The biggest upfront cost will be rent of facilities to teach in. I plan on renting a location hourly at an established exercise center for my kids and teens classes. For my older adult class, I look to teach at a community center during the day that will be conveniently located for the students. This will greatly cut down on my initial costs, making my chances of success greater. In five years after becoming solidly established I plan on moving to a permanent location.</p>
<p>For the kids and teens classes I will offer a free uniform with a membership so that the students all feel like they belong to the group. This fundraiser also goes toward the initial upfront costs of a large uniform order.</p>
<p>In order to bring in students and be successful, I will need to reach out to the community and advertise my school.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>When a person thinks of a martial arts studio, they usually imagine punching bags and mirrors and all sorts of fancy training equipment. One of the great things about how and what I teach is that none of that extra stuff is necessary. All I need is a big open room with preferably a wood floor. </p>
<p> <br/>The styles that I will be teaching are internal martial arts. The most well known one is Tai Chi. In the kids and teens classes it will be eventually shown as a fighting style, while in the older adults class it will be used as a holistic healing exercise. With internal martial arts, the focus is strengthening oneself from the inside out. It requires a disciplined mind and a relaxed body.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I've only set this fundraiser at $1000. The above startup costs will equal much more than that. I'm using this fundraiser to help give me a boost and make it a little easier for me to accomplish my dreams. If I raise my goal I will be elated and anything beyond will add to the smile in my heart. If you would like to learn some more details of this school, please visit the webpage at <a href=""http://www.dragonphoenix.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>www.dragonphoenix.org</u></a> . </p>

about the DreamMaker Scholarship Fund?</u></b></p>
<p>If there is anything more inspiring than a young man or
woman’s pursuit of their life’s dream, it’s a young person whose dream has been
severely challenged, even taken from them by circumstances beyond their
control, and who is determined not to give up. This is precisely the kind of
young people who come to Greystone – they have a long-held dream of attending
one of the US Federal Service Academies, and have received that dreaded letter
of rejection.  However, they are
unwilling to give up – and this is exactly why we are asking you to make a 100%
tax-deductible donation to the DreamMaker Scholarship Fund. </p>
<p>But, there is something unique and special about any
donation you make to the DreamMaker Scholarship Fund. Unlike all other
scholarship assistance, it will not be used to provide only one scholarship and
then be gone. Every dollar that you donate now will come back to the fund,
again and again, to be used repeatedly for successive generations of Greystone
students. </p>
<p>We’ll explain how this works in a moment – but before
describing why your tax deductible donation will have this especially powerful
impact, please allow us to tell you why the Greystone students who will benefit
from the DreamMaker Scholarship Fund deserve your help.</p>
<p><b><u>Who will benefit
from DreamMaker?</u></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>Greystone Preparatory School serves young people whose dream
is to serve our country as a military officer after completing their education
at one of our five Military Academies. What makes Greystone students stand out
is that in spite of having first-rate academic records as well as solid records
of accomplishment in athletics, community service, and extracurricular
leadership throughout High School, their initial applications for appointments
and admission to the Military Academy at West Point, Naval Academy, the Air
Force Academy, the Coast Guard Academy or the Merchant Marine Academy were turned
down. </p>
<p>This happens to thousands of highly qualified and motivated
young men and women every year. There are relatively few slots available at
each of the Service Academies for the many young people who dream of serving.
Very often they are turned down simply because their GPA was .001% below that
of the last candidate who was accepted, or because someone else had a slightly
better letter of recommendation – or even simply because there are limited
slots available in every Congressional district and there are always more
highly qualified applicants than available appointments.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for being turned down, many young men
and women simply shrug and turn away, pursuing their life’s goals by another
route. And most of them, because of who they are, will be successful in life.
But there are always a few very special young people who take the hit, get up,
dust themselves off, and move forward with determination toward the Service Academy dream that they will not
abandon. </p>
<p>These are the young people who find Greystone.  For the past ten years, Greystone has taken
these young people in and given them a first-class university education
that is the equivalent of their first year math, science and humanities
coursework at any of the Service Academies. They are worked with day and night
in every way to ensure that their second application is successful. And over
the past ten years over 98% of Greystone students have received at least one
academy appointment, and many have received multiple appointments. </p>
<p><b><u>What does
Greystone do?</u></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>Greystone is physically located on the campus of Schreiner
University, a small, vibrant Texas institution with roots as a military prep
school early in the 20<sup>th</sup> Century.  Since that time Schreiner has evolved into a
leading private university that draws students from around the country and the
world. Schreiner is no longer the small Texas Hill Country School that it once
was, but it retains its allegiance to the goals and aspirations of young people
whose ideals include service to others. That is why Greystone chose to
affiliate with Schreiner University - to offer young people a chance to achieve
their dream of becoming an academy-trained military officer.</p>
<p>Everybody knows that university education is expensive, and
Schreiner University is no exception. Students who come to Greystone must find
a way to pay for their freshman year at Schreiner. Between Schreiner’s
resources and Greystone ’s resources we are usually able to find the financial
help that students need. (It is important to say here that Greystone students
pay NOTHING extra for the Greystone program – they simply have to come up with
the normal freshman year expenses of attending Schreiner University,
and nothing else.) In most cases the assistance that Schreiner and Greystone
can offer together is enough, because most of our students have at least some
family resources to fill in the remaining financial gap between assistance and
expenses.</p>
<p><b><u>Why is there a
special need?</u></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>However, every year one or two young people with special
circumstances in their lives find us after being turned down, and they show us
the fire in their bellies and the grit in their personality, and we know that
these young people are destined to succeed. But – and this is where the Dream
Maker scholarship Fund will come into play – their families have no resources
to fill in that gap left when all available financial assistance is exhausted.
Some of these young people don’t even have families – they have grown up in
Foster Care, or in even more challenging circumstances. They have nothing
except faith in themselves and an unstoppable desire to be accepted at one of
the Service Academies and to make a life for themselves serving our country. </p>
<p>Greystone is not wealthy. We have no endowment. We have
several small scholarship funds that have been set up by the families of
friends of Greystone who have passed away, and we use the limited funds that
are available through their generosity every year to help as many students as
possible. But when a student comes to us with no resources at all, helping them
is very difficult. Do we give that one student the whole $10,000 that is needed
to fill in the gap, or do we help five highly qualified, high potential
students who need just $2,000 each to fill in the gap? This is not an easy
decision. Sometimes in the past we have decided that the young person who needs
the $10,000 is so special that we have done what, in our minds, was the right
thing and we have brought them on board. (And, by the way, in every single case
where we have done that it was absolutely the right decision, because these
students have <u>always</u> gone on to one of the academies and all are now
either upper classmen and outstanding leaders or already serving with
distinction as officers in the US Armed Forces.)</p>
<p>But we haven’t always been able to make that decision.
Sometimes the money just wasn’t there. And that is why we are asking you to
help us start the DreamMaker Scholarship Fund. This fund will be used only in
cases where the financial need is so extreme, and the potential of the young
person is so great, that turning them down would deny them their dream, and our
country their service, simply because a few more dollars can’t be found.</p>
<p><b><u>Why will my
donation have a long term impact?</u></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>Finally, here is why your donation to the DreamMaker
Scholarship Fund will do far more than just pay for financial assistance to one
of these deserving and highly qualified young people.</p>
<p>Every young person who enters a Service Academy and proves
themselves by reaching the end of their third year, and who therefore is
indisputably on their way to graduating and serving, is offered a financial
package by one or more of the great financial institutions that serve military
officers – institutions like USAA, and Navy Federal Credit Union.  This financial package is in the form of an
ultra-low interest, extended term loan that is collateralized simply by their
word of honor as an officer. The purpose of this loan has historically been to
enable the young Academy graduate to buy their dress uniforms, a new car, an
apartment, and perhaps to start married life. However, in the case of Greystone
students that have received funds from the DreamMaker Scholarship Fund, before
they borrow for any other purpose, they will borrow enough to pay back the
DreamMaker Scholarship Fund in full for the assistance that they received. We
will not make them sign any loan papers or legal contracts in return for receiving
DreamMaker Scholarship Fund assistance – they will simply sign a pledge that,
on their honor as a future officer, they will pay back the DreamMaker
Scholarship Fund immediately upon receiving  their Third Year loan package.</p>
<p>This means that year after year, into the indefinite future,
the donation that you make now to the DreamMaker Scholarship Fund will be
supporting generations of future officers attending one of the US Service
Academies. Every hundred dollars given now will ultimately do the work of
thousands of dollars, continuing to help young people whose service to our
country would otherwise be lost. With your tax-deductible help, Greystone and
the DreamMaker Scholarship Fund will be there to ensure that this does not happen.</p><br/><p></p></div>","What is unique
about the DreamMaker Scholarship Fund?
If there is anything more inspiring than a young man or
woman’s pursuit of their life’s dream, it’s a young person whose dream has been
severely challenged, even taken from them by circumstances beyond their
control, and who is determined not to give up. This is precisely the kind of
young people who come to Greystone – they have a long-held dream of attending
one of the US Federal Service Academies, and have received that dreaded letter
of rejection.  However, they are
unwilling to give up – and this is exactly why we are asking you to make a 100%
tax-deductible donation to the DreamMaker Scholarship Fund. 
But, there is something unique and special about any
donation you make to the DreamMaker Scholarship Fund. Unlike all other
scholarship assistance, it will not be used to provide only one scholarship and
then be gone. Every dollar that you donate now will come back to the fund,
again and again, to be used repeatedly for successive generations of Greystone
students. 
We’ll explain how this works in a moment – but before
describing why your tax deductible donation will have this especially powerful
impact, please allow us to tell you why the Greystone students who will benefit
from the DreamMaker Scholarship Fund deserve your help.
Who will benefit
from DreamMaker?

Greystone Preparatory School serves young people whose dream
is to serve our country as a military officer after completing their education
at one of our five Military Academies. What makes Greystone students stand out
is that in spite of having first-rate academic records as well as solid records
of accomplishment in athletics, community service, and extracurricular
leadership throughout High School, their initial applications for appointments
and admission to the Military Academy at West Point, Naval Academy, the Air
Force Academy, the Coast Guard Academy or the Merchant Marine Academy were turned
down. 
This happens to thousands of highly qualified and motivated
young men and women every year. There are relatively few slots available at
each of the Service Academies for the many young people who dream of serving.
Very often they are turned down simply because their GPA was .001% below that
of the last candidate who was accepted, or because someone else had a slightly
better letter of recommendation – or even simply because there are limited
slots available in every Congressional district and there are always more
highly qualified applicants than available appointments.
Whatever the reason for being turned down, many young men
and women simply shrug and turn away, pursuing their life’s goals by another
route. And most of them, because of who they are, will be successful in life.
But there are always a few very special young people who take the hit, get up,
dust themselves off, and move forward with determination toward the Service Academy dream that they will not
abandon. 
These are the young people who find Greystone.  For the past ten years, Greystone has taken
these young people in and given them a first-class university education
that is the equivalent of their first year math, science and humanities
coursework at any of the Service Academies. They are worked with day and night
in every way to ensure that their second application is successful. And over
the past ten years over 98% of Greystone students have received at least one
academy appointment, and many have received multiple appointments.

<p>Thank you to everyone who has helped me raise my goal! I have started another campaign at <a href=""http://igg.me/p/626563/x/5081332"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://igg.me/p/626563/x/5081332</a>, we are running out of time until I have to send the funds to Fiji! Please help me raise enough for rugby posts!</p>
<p>(""Welcome!"" in Fijian) </p>
<p>I have recently reached my goal but overfunding is even better so please still donate!!! The extra money will be going to a rugby field (the Fijian national sport) for the children to play on, tiling classroom floors, or a photo copier!</p>
<p>            My name is Paloma Palmer and over this past summer I lived in a village called Nasivikoso in the heart of the Fijian highlands. During my stay in this impoverished village I contributed to the construction of a local elementary and middle school. In the mornings I did various jobs of construction and taught English to children in grades 1-4 in the evenings. This school is important to the local Fijians because the other school  the children would have to attend is a 3 mile hike away from the village. Once the rainy seasons begin in Fiji, the attendance rate drops severely due to flooding and an increase in sickness. </p>
<blockquote>How are the children of Nasivikoso to better their community if they don't have an education?</blockquote>
<p>          This is why the local Nasivikoso Village School is crucial. The classrooms that are in the process of being  built are an amazing step forward, but there is still a lack of supplies. Desks and chairs are basic necessities for a productive class. I am returning next summer to Nasivikoso, hoping to have enough money to buy 30 pairs of desks and chairs. </p>
<p>         A desk and a chair is $100 and my goal is to raise $3,000. I will raise $2,000 from Indiegogo and the other $1,000 from selling t-shirts that I designed at my school. The Nasivikoso school is desperate to support their children with what they need to be successful. With the help of your donation, education for these children will be easier to access, with something so simple as a desk and a chair! Through the Rustic Pathways Foundation, 100% of the donations will go to the cause that I have chosen.</p>
<p>         If you contribute more than $25 I will send you a heartfelt thank-you letter and pictures of the desks and chairs, the children, and the school. If I do not reach my goal that is okay because every single penny that I raise is going to the Nasivikoso School so nothing will go to waste! Education is the key to the future of the Nasivikoso village and is a very important part in a child's life. Without education they will not be able to make a better life for their families and grow as a community. The people of Nasivikoso deserve an education and deserve a bright future. Please help with a donation! Any amount is welcome because with your donation, no matter what size, the children will get closer and closer to a better education. </p>

<p><strong>The Inspiration</strong></p>
<p>Last year Tim Kruse added 100 American Flags to the patriotic display along Greenville's historic Park Street.  Many residents of the street already participate and have a flag placed in their front yard by the Greenville Rotary.  The additional 100 flags placed a flag on average every 40’ on each side of the street.  Tim was inspired to go out on his own and acquire the flags after watching a CBS Sunday Morning episode that featured Larry Eckhardt aka “The Flagman” and his efforts to honor America’s fallen heroes.  This past year, Tim’s flags were used to line a portion of the funeral procession of the late Navy Seal, Chris Kyle.</p>
<p><strong>The Project</strong></p>
<p>This year Tim Kruse is working to extend the flag lined streets to include the sections of Stonewall and Johnson Streets that run between Park Street and Downtown Greenville. This will be an amazing display of patriotism on the sections of road that line the beautiful green space leading in and out of the heart of town.

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif !important; font-size: 15px !important; line-height: 1.45em !important; background-color: initial !important; border-width: initial; border-color: initial;""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"">The project consists in organising shows around Dodoma region and in Tanzania, in order to increase local awareness about the issues of orphans and street children, and the youth in general. The entertainment side of the project will attract wide attention and local support. We will also be handing out leaflets, setting up seminars and spreading information.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana;"">KISEDET is a Tanzanian NGO working in Dodoma
since 1998 and registered in 2007. The organisation was established in order to
support orphans, street children, handicapped children and those from the
poorest families living in rural areas of Dodoma Region. Our activities support
education, capacity building and improvement of livelihoods of the children and
their families. To date, over 580 students were supported through their
education, and currently we are hosting over 40 children at the Shukurani children home.</span></p><p></p></span><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana;"">In 2007 KISEDET's directors gave way to the Shukurani
Arts Project to train the children at the Shukurani Children's Home in
traditional dance, acrobatics, and dramatic performance for the children's
recreation as well as a form of therapy, in order for them to psychologically
externalise negative traumatic experiences. Art therapy has long been explored
as an effective way to stimulate children's development<span style=""""> </span>and help children with traumatic past in social reintegration.</span></p>
<p></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana;"">We are aiming to raise 11,000 euros.</span></p><p></p></span><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana;"">The funds will cover the costs of necessary equipment to enable the performances to take place smoothly. We need:</span></p><p></p></span><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana;"">- <b>Music equipment:</b> such as new instruments,
speakers and microphones.</span></p><p></p></span><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana;"">- <b>A van</b> to take the children and teachers around
for the tour</span></p><p></p><p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana;"">We will be running the project for a period of
one year and we predict that all funds from Indiegogo will be used up. All funds, wether we reach, don't reach or go over the goal, will
be devolved to organising sensitisation tours on youth matters in Tanzania by
the Shukurani Arts Tour. With less funds naturally we will achieve a lower
reach, while with higher funds we will be able to tour more
regions and obtain greater support.</span></p><p></p><p></p>

</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana;"">The Shukurani Arts Tour is the culmination of
years of training and an opportunity for the children to showcase their talent
and use it for a good purpose, i.e. to help children and youth in the same
position as them.</span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana;"">Arts and music are a crucial part of the campaign. S</span><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana;"">tudies have shown that art education plays a fundamental role in the
development of cognitive, motor, language, and social and emotional
capabilities in children (Source: <i>Young Children and the Arts: Making
Creative Connections</i>, 1998, Introduction). The impact is beneficial to
children’s development as it stimulates memory, builds relationships and
provides fulfillment and a sense of craftsmanship, which gives hope and
direction particularly for Street Children who have often experienced a traumatic
past. Other than being a form of therapy and an opportunity to unleash the
children’s creative talents, they are also culturally significant, giving the
children a chance to creatively explore and take pride in their cultural roots.
Thus, </span><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana;"">Shukurani's children benefit directly immensely
from performing during this tour.</span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt;""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana;"">The
traditional dance aspect of the children’s performance has attracted particular
attention of government officials and those from various Tanzanian groups and
institutions who regularly invite the Shukurani Arts Group to perform during
official conferences and/or informal gatherings. The songs and dramatic performances that the children perform often portray the environment that Street Children live in and the issues related to
the hardships they face, offering hopeful themes. This means
that they take the form of advocacy and awareness raising for the audiences and feature as impactful campaigns towards
policies that combat issues of street children. The CD and DVD were recorded in order to
spread the messages outside performances and reach a wider audience.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana;"">This is not a stand alone project, but the
natural continuation towards a broader goal. Although it
started as an experiment, KISEDET's directors and trustees soon saw the benefits of investing resources in arts and culture. The phases were
not laid out from the beginning but, rather, evolved naturally out a of a
shared vision to improve the life of children of the region of Dodoma through art.</span></p><p></p><p></p>

organisation that has worked in Dodoma, Tanzania for many years and has all the
capabilities to carry out this advocacy project. Many performances have already
been organised however so many funds are lost in hiring vehicles and music
equipment, funds that could be saved for the principal projects. For this reason we are
setting up a separate arts and culture sensitisation project, that would not
take away funds from day-to-day NGO activities and from sponsoring education
for the children. KISEDET has been working in Tanzania for over 15 years and
has dealt with far more complicated logistical issues. This project evolved in an organic manner, and the children have already had many
experiences at performing, only not with the specific purpose of this project,
yet.</span></p><p></p><p></p>

</div>","Shukurani Tour Project

The Shukurani Arts tour is a campaign organised by the NGO KISEDET which aims to sensitize the local population on the issues faced by children from the poorest areas, to build empathy and encourage children and their families to change the way local authorities have neglected their responsibilities to ensure children's rights are upheld. 
The project consists in organising shows around Dodoma region and in Tanzania, in order to increase local awareness about the issues of orphans and street children, and the youth in general. The entertainment side of the project will attract wide attention and local support. We will also be handing out leaflets, setting up seminars and spreading information.



KISEDET is a Tanzanian NGO working in Dodoma
since 1998 and registered in 2007. The organisation was established in order to
support orphans, street children, handicapped children and those from the
poorest families living in rural areas of Dodoma Region. Our activities support
education, capacity building and improvement of livelihoods of the children and
their families. To date, over 580 students were supported through their
education, and currently we are hosting over 40 children at the Shukurani children home.
In 2007 KISEDET's directors gave way to the Shukurani
Arts Project to train the children at the Shukurani Children's Home in
traditional dance, acrobatics, and dramatic performance for the children's
recreation as well as a form of therapy, in order for them to psychologically
externalise negative traumatic experiences. Art therapy has long been explored
as an effective way to stimulate children's development and help children with traumatic past in social reintegration.




What We Need & What You Get


We are aiming to raise 11,000 euros.
The funds will cover the costs of necessary equipment to enable the performances to take place smoothly. We need:
- Music equipment: such as new instruments,
speakers and microphones.
- A van to take the children and teachers around
for the tour
- Costumes and tools to improve the performances
- Contributions for the teachers and organisers
of the performances
We will be running the project for a period of
one year and we predict that all funds from Indiegogo will be used up. All funds, wether we reach, don't reach or go over the goal, will
be devolved to organising sensitisation tours on youth matters in Tanzania by
the Shukurani Arts Tour. With less funds naturally we will achieve a lower
reach, while with higher funds we will be able to tour more
regions and obtain greater support.
We have a few perks that our supporters can look
forward to in order to show our appreciation for your contribution including laminated drawings made by the children, Shukurani Arts Group music CDs and DVDs, and traditional art pieces from Dodoma. 





The Impact


The Shukurani Arts Tour is the culmination of
years of training and an opportunity for the children to showcase their talent
and use it for a good purpose, i.e. to help children and youth in the same
position as them.
Arts and music are a crucial part of the campaign. Studies have shown that art education plays a fundamental role in the
development of cognitive, motor, language, and social and emotional
capabilities in children (Source: Young Children and the Arts: Making
Creative Connections, 1998, Introduction). The impact is beneficial to
children’s development as it stimulates memory, builds relationships and
provides fulfillment and a sense of craftsmanship, which gives hope and
direction particularly for Street Children who have often experienced a traumatic
past. Other than being a form of therapy and an opportunity to unleash the
children’s creative talents, they are also culturally significant, giving the
children a chance to creatively explore and take pride in their cultural roots.
Thus, Shukurani's children benefit directly immensely
from performing during this tour.
The
traditional dance aspect of the children’s performance has attracted particular
attention of government officials and those from various Tanzanian groups and
institutions who regularly invite the Shukurani Arts Group to perform during
official conferences and/or informal gatherings. The songs and dramatic performances that the children perform often portray the environment that Street Children live in and the issues related to
the hardships they face, offering hopeful themes. This means
that they take the form of advocacy and awareness raising for the audiences and feature as impactful campaigns towards
policies that combat issues of street children. The CD and DVD were recorded in order to
spread the messages outside performances and reach a wider audience.
This is not a stand alone project, but the
natural continuation towards a broader goal. Although it
started as an experiment, KISEDET's directors and trustees soon saw the benefits of investing resources in arts and culture. The phases were
not laid out from the beginning but, rather, evolved naturally out a of a
shared vision to improve the life of children of the region of Dodoma through art.
These are the recorded previous phases:



Phase 1: Training in traditional
dance, acrobatics and theatre on weekends for children’s recreation; December
2007 – March 2008


Phase 2: Continued training in
traditional dance, acrobatics and theatre with the aim to present shows at the
regional government office and guests of KISEDET; March 2008 – December 2009


Phase 3: Continued training and
additional singing lessons to record Shukurani Arts Group CD; January 2010 –
December 2010.


Phase 4: Increase number of shows
and improve performance, by hiring traditional dance, acrobatics, theatre
teacher; January 2011 – November 2012.


Phase 5: Practice to record DVD of
children’s dance and music videos and information about KISEDET and issues of
Street Children in Dodoma Region; December 2012 – Ongoing. The DVD is now
complete.


Coming phase: Shukurani
Arts Group Tour around Dodoma Region and Tanzania, to raise awareness
about issues of Street Children - waiting to raise funds for running costs,
van, music equipment, etc.



We guarantee that KISEDET is an a serious
organisation that has worked in Dodoma, Tanzania for many years and has all the
capabilities to carry out this advocacy project. Many performances have already
been organised however so many funds are lost in hiring vehicles and music
equipment, funds that could be saved for the principal projects. For this reason we are
setting up a separate arts and culture sensitisation project, that would not
take away funds from day-to-day NGO activities and from sponsoring education
for the children. KISEDET has been working in Tanzania for over 15 years and
has dealt with far more complicated logistical issues. This project evolved in an organic manner, and the children have already had many
experiences at performing, only not with the specific purpose of this project,
yet.


KISEDET's
other activities include supporting children from the poorest families to get
an education, building classrooms and teachers offices, pit-latrine,
dispensaries in order to assist forgotten rural schools around Dodoma.

Progetto Shukurani Tour


Lo Shukurani Arts Tour è una campagna organizzata
dalla ONG KISEDET che mira a sensibilizzare la popolazione locale sui problemi
affrontati dai bambini delle zone più povere della Tanzania. I nostri spettacoli e workshops creano empatia
e incoraggiano i bambini e le loro famiglie a richiedere che le autorità locali
garantiscano che i diritti dei bambini vengano rispettati. 
Il progetto consiste nell’organizzare spettacoli in
giro per la regione di Dodoma e in Tanzania, al fine di aumentare la
consapevolezza sui problemi di orfani e bambini di strada, e i giovani in
generale. L’aspetto d’intrattenimento del progetto attirerà l’attenzione e il sostegno
locale. Abbiamo in programma di distribuire volantini, istituire seminari e diffondere
informazioni sui diritti dei bambini.
KISEDET è una ONG che lavora in Tanzania, Dodoma dal
1998 e registrata dal 2007. L’organizzazione è stata fondata al fine di
sostenere gli orfani, i bambini di strada, i bambini portatori di handicap e coloro
provenienti dalle famiglie più povere delle zone rurali della regione di
Dodoma. Le nostre attività sostengono l’istruzione, lo sviluppo delle capacità
e il miglioramento delle condizioni di vita dei bambini e delle loro famiglie.
Ad oggi, più di 580 studenti sono stati sostenuti nell’istruzione e attualmente
vengono ospitati più di 40 bambini nella casa accoglienza. 
Nel 2007 gli amministratori di KISEDET hanno

Di cosa abbiamo bisogno e cosa si ottiene


Puntiamo a raccogliere 11.000 €. I fondi copriranno
i costi delle attrezzature necessarie per consentire la realizzazione degli
spettacoli e della nostra campagna. 
Abbiamo bisogno di: 
- Attrezzature musicali: tipo nuovi strumenti,
altoparlanti e microfoni.
- Un furgone per portare i bambini e gli insegnanti
in giro per il tour 
- Costumi e gli strumenti per migliorare gli
spettacoli 
- Contributi per gli insegnanti e gli organizzatori
degli spettacoli 
Porteremo in esecuzione il progetto per un periodo
di un anno e si prevede che tutti i fondi da Indiegogo saranno esaurito. Tutti
i fondi che riusciamo a ricavare, se raggiungiamo o meno l’obbiettivo, saranno devoluti

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am an Australian living and working in Mongolia for a total of 18 months.  I am employed within the state education system as a teacher trainer and have contacts in each of the Mongolia's 21 aimags (provinces).</p>
<p>This campaign is important to me because I can write teacher support resources and transmit them over email, but audio-visual resources that I find and get excited about are useless without projector screens to support bringing them into classrooms. <br/></p>
<p>I am not a techno-junkie. However, for subject classes that do not have a textbook, or for teaching concepts that seem very removed and obscure to students within a land-locked country (e.g. teaching about shell fish in Oman, as an IGCSE text), projectors and photocopying credits are very, very, very useful resources indeed. I am not promoting an approach that replaces teachers with technology. Rather, we need to support teachers to teach by supporting them with a base level of technology.</p>
<p>Please help!!<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>The postal service can be slow, so it is best and easiest if you can donate funds so that I can go out and purchase the projectors to be distributed out to schools. I am working with my colleague who has worked as an educator here for over 20 years (in rural, ger district and city schools) and together we will decide which schools will be assisted after the first two we have identified. She speaks fluent Mongolian and English. <br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I have conducted a needs assessment, and without projectors, it is very difficult for students to access high-quality, audio-visual resources to support their learning and the development of reading and listening skills through up-to-date resources. By projecting computer-based texts onto a chalk or whiteboard through a projector, we can also support collaborative learning and save valuable in-class time.<br/></p>
<p>I am living in-country for another year and 
will be available for you to contact via email to receive an update on 
how your contributions have made a difference.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Spread word of my cause!<br/><br/>If you work at a school, speak with some of your colleagues and see if you can organise a 'free dress day', with proceeds going towards projectors for Mongolian schools.<br/><br/>You could also consider approaching me to instigate a pen pal or cultural exchange programme between your school and a school here. I have many contacts and if I can see educational value to your ideas, then I am more than happy to support them how I can.<br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Short Summary

<p>The '<b>Children of the Ganges</b>' was started by a group of volunteers who have been so moved by the plight of street children in India that we decided to do something about it. We started a center in 2011 to provide FREE quality education to underprivileged children in Rishikesh, India.  The goals of the center are: <br/></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>to <strong>provide free education</strong> from kindergarten to senior secondary level for children regardless of religion, caste, gender or social status</li>
<li>to <strong>promote the qualities of kindness and compassion</strong>, ethical behaviour and a sense of universal responsibility</li>
</ul>
<p>The center is funded entirely through donations and fundraising campaigns coordinated by a small group of volunteers.  </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We teach them reading and writing in Hindi and English, meditation, social skills, art and music. We believe that through education the children have a better chance to succeed in life/the future.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We would like to raise $3,000 USD for the academic year 2013-14 to ensure that every child who attends the center receives a FREE NUTRICIOUS WARM MEAL each evening.  While the space for the school has been generously donated through summer 2014, it costs approximately $10 per day to feed the children, and local teachers receive a small monthly salary as well.  </p>
<p>Every donation of just $10 USD ensures that all of the students are fed a warm meal for one evening and that the school will continue to provide quality programming to its students. </p>
<p>Each donation will be recognized by the Volunteers and/or children! </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We believe that through education and nutritious meals, we are providing children of Rishikesh a better chance to succeed in their lives.  We hope you can help in our efforts to inspire children with the qualities of leadership and motivation to bring peace, happiness and well-being to their homes and community.   Thank you for your support!</p>

My name is Mikey Muhanna and I'd like to tell you about Melvin.</p><p>Melvin was a student of mine at Reed HS in New Orleans’ Recovery School District. He took his studies very seriously and worked hard to graduate on schedule, becoming the first person in his family to attend college.

After that experience, Melvin found himself with a severely damaged sense of self worth, $5,000 in student loans and very few options.</p><p>The tragedy is that Melvin’s story is not unique: more than half of my former students who enrolled in college have since dropped out. In fact, approximately 80% of low income students who enroll in college drop out without getting their degrees. </p><p>Melvin's situation demanded another option for him to build the skills and tools necessary to bounce back. Positive Space has become that option. </p><p><a href=""http://positivespacenola.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Positive Space</a> is a non-profit co-working space in New Orleans dedicated to increasing the rate of college persistence and graduation among low-income high school graduates, who often lack the personal and social skills to succeed in college. Positive Space seeks to accomplish this by teaching recent high school graduates the fundamentals of computer programming through a volunteer-administered curriculum that will serve as a conduit to develop student grit, professionalism and emotional maturity. </p><p>Through Positive Space, Melvin is walking a different path and winning, and I know the rest of my students (and millions in similar situations) can win as well if they are just empowered to develop their skills before it costs $25,000 a year to learn.</p><br/><h3>Our Progress So Far</h3><p>Positive Space is in the early stages of its development. I am prototyping the model with Melvin and will continue the test for the remainder of this academic year. Melvin participates in the program while maintaining a full time job. Monday through Friday, he works 8 hours at a coffee shop during the day and then in the evenings comes to the 4.0 Schools office space to work through the CodeAcademy curriculum on a laptop that was donated to Positive Space. He maintains a <a href=""http://positivespacenola.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">daily blog</a> about his experiences on the Positive Space website and conferences with me every evening to discuss the day’s lesson and make plans for the following day. Over the past two months, Melvin has successfully completed Code Academy’s Web Fundamentals track, which includes an introduction to HTML, CSS and jQuery.</p><p>We hope to complete this pilot program this year, pay off his student loans and build enough support to expand our programming to more students.</p><h3>What We Need</h3><p>Right now, we are fundraising to pay for three things: </p><ul>
