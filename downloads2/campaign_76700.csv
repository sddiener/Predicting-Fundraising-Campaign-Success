receiving a new pair of pajamas every Christmas Eve from my family.  Getting to go to bed feeling so cozy has always

<li>Blues &amp; BBQ</li>
<li>Other, by inspiration in the ongoing attempt to keep our beloved base of operations intact.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is always something that needs attention.  Much of what arises is attended to by in-house volunteers with the necessary tools and skills, with little money spent.</p>
<p> Now we look ahead to a very large project like repairing the roof and making it good for the next generation of community builders and we realize we need help to get it done. After all, with our small membership it is good if we can focus on borrowing less and working on our ongoing social justice projects.</p>
<p>We believe that what we do here and in the wider community has value to the world at large.  Who of us can say which of our young people will go from here with these living values to lead another community far away in this country or abroad.  We are growing the kinder, more conscientious generation here, and sharing the fruits of our lives with people in need of kindness, inclusion and sustenance.  </p>
<p> Every dollar you provide to help us literally ""keep a roof over our heads,"" promotes and sustains this work and leaves us able to focus on those other things closer to ground level that our volunteers can take care of to ensure the integrity, safety, and accessibility of our old building.   With your help, the members of our wider community that depend on us for their daily bread will be assured that we remain here with them.  This will be a great comfort in their lives; knowing that every member of their family gets a solid meal at least once a day.  How better can anyone spend the price of a six-pack, or a couple of latte’s.  People get happy, proud of themselves, and ""sustainability"" people get sustained.  See?  Good brain chemicals flow all around.</p>
<p>Every contributor of $15 or more will receive a pack of 10 note cards with envelopes depicting a scene from within or around our church.  Of course your donations to our survival are 100% tax deductible. </p>
<p>If you are not one who can offer cash, please consider sharing this appeal with your friends and family, or, if you live near us, come by and volunteer in the kitchen any weekday afternoon and help the Evening Sandwich Program, or attend one of our small group meetings to share ideas on how to spread the message of sustainability and humility and helpfulness.  Come join us on a Sunday morning for fellowship and feel welcome.  You might just find a committee to join that will change your life, and hopefully that of someone else, for the betterment of the human condition.</p></span></div>","The Universalist-Unitarian Church of Waterville, Maine has been Representing liberal religious values at this location since 1826.

Sustainability Group seeks to continually improve the green footprint of our congregation and promotes green values in the surrounding community through the promotion of green values, providing public education on weatherization, and volunteering with “Sustain Mid-Maine” sustainability coalition.  Through these efforts we affect attitudes toward public transportation/access, alternative energy/conservation, and the support of local agriculture.

Other, by inspiration in the ongoing attempt to keep our beloved base of operations intact.

There is always something that needs attention.  Much of what arises is attended to by in-house volunteers with the necessary tools and skills, with little money spent.
 Now we look ahead to a very large project like repairing the roof and making it good for the next generation of community builders and we realize we need help to get it done. After all, with our small membership it is good if we can focus on borrowing less and working on our ongoing social justice projects.
We believe that what we do here and in the wider community has value to the world at large.  Who of us can say which of our young people will go from here with these living values to lead another community far away in this country or abroad.  We are growing the kinder, more conscientious generation here, and sharing the fruits of our lives with people in need of kindness, inclusion and sustenance.  
 Every dollar you provide to help us literally ""keep a roof over our heads,"" promotes and sustains this work and leaves us able to focus on those other things closer to ground level that our volunteers can take care of to ensure the integrity, safety, and accessibility of our old building.   With your help, the members of our wider community that depend on us for their daily bread will be assured that we remain here with them.  This will be a great comfort in their lives; knowing that every member of their family gets a solid meal at least once a day.  How better can anyone spend the price of a six-pack, or a couple of latte’s.  People get happy, proud of themselves, and ""sustainability"" people get sustained.  See?  Good brain chemicals flow all around.
Every contributor of $15 or more will receive a pack of 10 note cards with envelopes depicting a scene from within or around our church.  Of course your donations to our survival are 100% tax deductible. 
If you are not one who can offer cash, please consider sharing this appeal with your friends and family, or, if you live near us, come by and volunteer in the kitchen any weekday afternoon and help the Evening Sandwich Program, or attend one of our small group meetings to share ideas on how to spread the message of sustainability and humility and helpfulness.  Come join us on a Sunday morning for fellowship and feel welcome.  You might just find a committee to join that will change your life, and hopefully that of someone else, for the betterment of the human condition.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Pride vs. Prejudice: Sullivan Solidarity Ball</strong> is an event being held on Saturday, April 20th, 2013 in Terre Haute, Indiana. Sullivan, Indiana recently made national headlines when a small group of parents, students and teachers from the area formed to plan a “traditional” prom upon hearing news that Sullivan High School would allow same-sex couples to participate in the school’s Grand March and Prom activities. <br/><br/><strong>Pride vs. Prejudice: Sullivan Solidarity Ball</strong> is a response to the outpouring of love and support to the LGBTQ community from the community of Sullivan and around the world. This event will be open to all who wish to attend and show support and solidarity to the students and community of Sullivan who firmly believe that love has value and meaning regardless of sexual orientation.<br/><br/><strong><em>PLEASE NOTE</em></strong> that we are in no way affiliated with Sullivan High School and we are VERY excited for all SHS students to be able to attend their prom with whomever they choose! This event is merely meant as a compliment to the local prom and as a larger celebration of equality and love for the entire community! Please know that we are NOT creating a separate prom! That is not our intention! This event is truly meant as a means for adults and kids from all walks of life to come together and celebrate equality and love!

<p>There is nothing brave about having love in your heart for others. There is, however, something cowardly about wanting to deny people the same freedom that you enjoy and believing that the way you live is the only acceptable lifestyle that exists.

There is no greater impact you can make on this world! </p>
<h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help!</strong></h2>
<p>This is a bold fundraiser for a worthy cause. But if you cannot contribute at this time, you can help by spreading the word. <strong>Word of mouth is really important if we're going to be successful!</strong> Please tell your family, friends, co-workers, colleagues, and associates about the Solidarity Ball and our goal to raise $9,000 in 45 days.

<h3><strong>Why This Non-Profit Campaign is So Important</strong></h3>
<p>Today it’s hard to find positive role models for our children to emulate.  Sometimes we need to look to the past to find our heroes for today.  But how can we keep the memories and achievements of sports history’s greatest athletes as fresh today as they were back then?</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/619063/pictures/full/20130115180404-montage4.jpg?1358301863"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Once in a while a project comes along that has the cache and charisma to transcend race, gender, age and nationality.  The SPORTS IMMORTALS MOBILE MUSEUM EXPERIENCE is such a project.   Its not only the manifestation of the lifelong effort of one man's love and dedication to sports history, but also a true and inspirational story of never losing sight of your dreams. </p>
<p>My name is Jim Platt and this campaign is about helping make my father's lifelong dream come true. With your help and support...together we can make it happen!  </p>
<h3><em>All donations will go directly to our 501(c) non-profit organization, The Platt Sports Foundation.  This IndieGoGo account is linked directly to our Foundation's Bank Account at Chase Bank.*</em></h3>
<h3><strong>How it all Began...</strong></h3>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/611598/pictures/full/20130109185500-photo2.png?1357786505"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Joel Platt’s lifelong quest to assemble the largest and most valuable collection of sports memorabilia has been filled with both triumph and tragedy.  It all started in 1943, when a mischievous four-year-old boy threw a match into the gas tank of a car resulting in a towering inferno.  Bedridden for over a year with severe burns after the explosion, Joel’s parents bought him baseball cards to entertain him during his long days of recovery.  His first one was of Babe Ruth. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 150px;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/619078/pictures/full/20130115181011-Ruth_Goudey.png?1358302216"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This 1933 Goudey card was what ultimately determined the path that Joel would take for the rest of his life.  He decided at a young age that his goal would be to preserve the achievements of great athletes so that their memories would live forever in the hearts and minds of generations to come and serve as inspiration to us all to try our best in all aspects of life.</p>
<p><img alt=""Teenage Joel Platt stands in front of his growing collection"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/616174/pictures/full/20130113151455-IMG_0004.jpg?1358118903"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>To that end, as he grew older, his collection grew to include programs, tickets, autographs and actual mementos used by the athletes.  Upon becoming a teenager, Joel embarked on a sixty-year adventure, traveling over one million miles to curate over one million mementos for the Sports Immortals Collection. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/616178/pictures/full/20130113151741-IMG_0005.jpg?1358119069"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Along the way he had the unique opportunity to meet several of the most famous athletes and their relatives including Mrs. Honus Wagner, Mrs. Babe Ruth, Mrs. Jim Thorpe, Muhammad Ali, Gordie Howe, Jack Dempsey, Wilt Chamberlain, just to name a few. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/612808/pictures/full/20130110160526-photo4.png?1357862734"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>He related to them his goal of honoring the accomplishments of the greatest sports icons.  More often than not, Joel came home with a special object to represent the athlete in the Sports Immortals Collection.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/611599/pictures/full/20130109185524-photo3.png?1357786529"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Now at the age of 74, Joel Platt is the Founder of Sports Immortals, Inc.  As he reflects on his life, he realizes that the most precious treasures he obtained on his journey were not the artifacts themselves, but the inspirational lessons and gifts of knowledge he learned along the way.  The time has come to share his collection and all the anecdotal stories with sports fans young and old so that they may benefit from the culmination of his life’s work. </p>
<h3><strong>What’s the Big Idea? It’s All About the Experience</strong></h3>
<p>The Sports Immortals team has designed several “must see” projects that will combine some of the most priceless sports artifacts with the most compelling multimedia technology.  The SPORTS IMMORTALS MOBILE MUSEUM is the first of the planned projects to be launched. It will be the most innovative experience of its kind and tour the United States stopping at major sporting events, universities, local schools, shopping malls, state fairs, etc.  Imagine hundreds of thousands of children having the opportunity to see Jackie Robinson’s game worn hat and learning how courageous he was by breaking Major League Baseball’s color barrier in 1948.  What if they could learn about the determination and focus of Jesse Owens competing in the 1936 Berlin Olympics with Hitler in the stands, ultimately winning four gold medals?  How about Little Leaguers motivated by the dedication of Lou Gehrig and Cal Ripken Jr. to never want to miss a practice or a game?   These are just a few examples of the valuable benefits that will accrue to the public once this exciting project begins.</p>
<h3><strong>Sounds Great, but What Will it Look Like?</strong></h3>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/612809/pictures/full/20130110160558-photo5.png?1357862763"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>This mobile shrine to sports will trace sports history beginning in the 19<sup>th</sup> century area and ending in the “Immortals Among Us” Section.  Each twenty-year period shall feature the Immortals of that era describing in rich detail not only their career achievements, but also their work ethic, any obstacles they overcame and other anecdotal stories they may have shared with Joel Platt.  Guests will be entertained and educated by actual artifacts used by the athletes, video footage and historical information describing the political climate in which they competed, such as Joe Louis uniting our nation by defeating the German boxer, Max Schmeling, during World War II.<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/612813/pictures/full/20130110160657-photo7.png?1357862820"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Upon entering the exhibit, visitors will find a large video wall displaying great moments in sports.</p>
<p><a href=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/612814/pictures/full/20130110160718-photo8.png?1357862841"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/612814/pictures/full/20130110160718-photo8.png?1357862841"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>The photos above and below show examples of how rooms will be organized inside the Experience.  Please notice that sports fans will be given information through the same source that people received in that time period.  The above features the old time radio.  This same theme occurs throughout, i.e. the “Immortals Among Us” features WiFi, Television, Ipad, Phones, etc.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/612815/pictures/full/20130110160742-photo9.png?1357862866"" src="""" style=""""/>Upon completion of the tour, visitors will enter the final area which provides them the opportunity to purchase Sports Immortals Branded Merchandise, to take a photograph holding a unique sports artifact like a Babe Ruth bat and lastly, to vote for whom they believe should be the original 50 athletes to be inducted into the Sports Immortals Hall of Fame, and lastly to learn the benefits of living a healthy lifestyle and the dangers of obesity in this country.  </p>
<h3><strong>When Will the Tour Begin?</strong></h3>
<p>According to MRA, once we reach our funding goal, it should take about 100-120 days for them to have the Sports Immortals Mobile Museum Experience ready to roll.  </p>
<h3><strong>Can the Mobile Museum Come to my Home Town?</strong></h3>
<p>Yes!  It is possible.  As one of the incentives to increase donations, the city that contributes the most funding will receive an exciting celebration for all the contributors and their friends.  The Sports Immortals Tour will make a special stop for these wonderful and passionate supporters.  The routing of the tour has not been determined.  Once we reach our goal and start planning the locations, the winning city will be contacted and we will schedule the big event.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Support Sports Immortals?</strong></h2>
<p>In today’s economy, it is very difficult to obtain funding for new projects.  Sponsors are very selective on which concepts they support and are most likely to provide additional funding to projects that are already operational.  One of our goals is to keep the exhibition free of charge so that everyone can see it regardless of socioeconomic constraints.  Your contribution to the development of the Sports Immortals Mobile Museum Experience will not only help us preserve the memories and achievement of the world’s greatest athletes, but it will also help Sports Immortals attract the sponsorship dollars necessary for the tour to last many years and educate and inspire millions of sports fans across the country.   </p>
<p>Joel Platt has dedicated his life to fulfilling his dream.  He is not a collector, but a curator on a mission to preserve sports history.  He has done his part to assemble the collection, but we need your help so that he can start sharing it with the public.  To use a football analogy, Joel has carried the football 99 yards down the field.  With your financial support, together we can take it into the endzone and everyone will win! </p>

<h3><strong>How Much Do You Need?  How Will the Funds Be Used?</strong></h3>
<p>We are seeking $350,000 that will be used for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design and installation of the exhibition inside the expandable 18 wheeler trailer</li>

<li>Marketing (Television, Print, Radio, Internet, Social Media, Grassroots, Sponsorship Efforts, etc.)</li>

Why This Non-Profit Campaign is So Important
Today it’s hard to find positive role models for our children to emulate.  Sometimes we need to look to the past to find our heroes for today.  But how can we keep the memories and achievements of sports history’s greatest athletes as fresh today as they were back then?

Once in a while a project comes along that has the cache and charisma to transcend race, gender, age and nationality.  The SPORTS IMMORTALS MOBILE MUSEUM EXPERIENCE is such a project.   Its not only the manifestation of the lifelong effort of one man's love and dedication to sports history, but also a true and inspirational story of never losing sight of your dreams. 
My name is Jim Platt and this campaign is about helping make my father's lifelong dream come true. With your help and support...together we can make it happen!  
All donations will go directly to our 501(c) non-profit organization, The Platt Sports Foundation.  This IndieGoGo account is linked directly to our Foundation's Bank Account at Chase Bank.*
How it all Began...

Joel Platt’s lifelong quest to assemble the largest and most valuable collection of sports memorabilia has been filled with both triumph and tragedy.  It all started in 1943, when a mischievous four-year-old boy threw a match into the gas tank of a car resulting in a towering inferno.  Bedridden for over a year with severe burns after the explosion, Joel’s parents bought him baseball cards to entertain him during his long days of recovery.  His first one was of Babe Ruth. 

This 1933 Goudey card was what ultimately determined the path that Joel would take for the rest of his life.  He decided at a young age that his goal would be to preserve the achievements of great athletes so that their memories would live forever in the hearts and minds of generations to come and serve as inspiration to us all to try our best in all aspects of life.

To that end, as he grew older, his collection grew to include programs, tickets, autographs and actual mementos used by the athletes.  Upon becoming a teenager, Joel embarked on a sixty-year adventure, traveling over one million miles to curate over one million mementos for the Sports Immortals Collection. 

Along the way he had the unique opportunity to meet several of the most famous athletes and their relatives including Mrs. Honus Wagner, Mrs. Babe Ruth, Mrs. Jim Thorpe, Muhammad Ali, Gordie Howe, Jack Dempsey, Wilt Chamberlain, just to name a few. 

He related to them his goal of honoring the accomplishments of the greatest sports icons.  More often than not, Joel came home with a special object to represent the athlete in the Sports Immortals Collection.

Now at the age of 74, Joel Platt is the Founder of Sports Immortals, Inc.  As he reflects on his life, he realizes that the most precious treasures he obtained on his journey were not the artifacts themselves, but the inspirational lessons and gifts of knowledge he learned along the way.  The time has come to share his collection and all the anecdotal stories with sports fans young and old so that they may benefit from the culmination of his life’s work. 
What’s the Big Idea? It’s All About the Experience
The Sports Immortals team has designed several “must see” projects that will combine some of the most priceless sports artifacts with the most compelling multimedia technology.  The SPORTS IMMORTALS MOBILE MUSEUM is the first of the planned projects to be launched. It will be the most innovative experience of its kind and tour the United States stopping at major sporting events, universities, local schools, shopping malls, state fairs, etc.  Imagine hundreds of thousands of children having the opportunity to see Jackie Robinson’s game worn hat and learning how courageous he was by breaking Major League Baseball’s color barrier in 1948.  What if they could learn about the determination and focus of Jesse Owens competing in the 1936 Berlin Olympics with Hitler in the stands, ultimately winning four gold medals?  How about Little Leaguers motivated by the dedication of Lou Gehrig and Cal Ripken Jr. to never want to miss a practice or a game?   These are just a few examples of the valuable benefits that will accrue to the public once this exciting project begins.
Sounds Great, but What Will it Look Like?

 
This mobile shrine to sports will trace sports history beginning in the 19th century area and ending in the “Immortals Among Us” Section.  Each twenty-year period shall feature the Immortals of that era describing in rich detail not only their career achievements, but also their work ethic, any obstacles they overcame and other anecdotal stories they may have shared with Joel Platt.  Guests will be entertained and educated by actual artifacts used by the athletes, video footage and historical information describing the political climate in which they competed, such as Joe Louis uniting our nation by defeating the German boxer, Max Schmeling, during World War II.
Upon entering the exhibit, visitors will find a large video wall displaying great moments in sports.

The photos above and below show examples of how rooms will be organized inside the Experience.  Please notice that sports fans will be given information through the same source that people received in that time period.  The above features the old time radio.  This same theme occurs throughout, i.e. the “Immortals Among Us” features WiFi, Television, Ipad, Phones, etc.
Upon completion of the tour, visitors will enter the final area which provides them the opportunity to purchase Sports Immortals Branded Merchandise, to take a photograph holding a unique sports artifact like a Babe Ruth bat and lastly, to vote for whom they believe should be the original 50 athletes to be inducted into the Sports Immortals Hall of Fame, and lastly to learn the benefits of living a healthy lifestyle and the dangers of obesity in this country.  
When Will the Tour Begin?
According to MRA, once we reach our funding goal, it should take about 100-120 days for them to have the Sports Immortals Mobile Museum Experience ready to roll.  
Can the Mobile Museum Come to my Home Town?
Yes!  It is possible.  As one of the incentives to increase donations, the city that contributes the most funding will receive an exciting celebration for all the contributors and their friends.  The Sports Immortals Tour will make a special stop for these wonderful and passionate supporters.  The routing of the tour has not been determined.  Once we reach our goal and start planning the locations, the winning city will be contacted and we will schedule the big event.
Why Support Sports Immortals?
In today’s economy, it is very difficult to obtain funding for new projects.  Sponsors are very selective on which concepts they support and are most likely to provide additional funding to projects that are already operational.  One of our goals is to keep the exhibition free of charge so that everyone can see it regardless of socioeconomic constraints.  Your contribution to the development of the Sports Immortals Mobile Museum Experience will not only help us preserve the memories and achievement of the world’s greatest athletes, but it will also help Sports Immortals attract the sponsorship dollars necessary for the tour to last many years and educate and inspire millions of sports fans across the country.   
Joel Platt has dedicated his life to fulfilling his dream.  He is not a collector, but a curator on a mission to preserve sports history.  He has done his part to assemble the collection, but we need your help so that he can start sharing it with the public.  To use a football analogy, Joel has carried the football 99 yards down the field.  With your financial support, together we can take it into the endzone and everyone will win! 

How Much Do You Need?  How Will the Funds Be Used?
We are seeking $350,000 that will be used for the following:

Design and installation of the exhibition inside the expandable 18 wheeler trailer
Operation of the Exhibition (Lease of Truck, Gas, Staff, Security, Insurance, Site Fees, etc.)
Marketing (Television, Print, Radio, Internet, Social Media, Grassroots, Sponsorship Efforts, etc.)
Events
How Can I Help and be Part of Sports History?
1.  We would be so grateful if you could make a financial contribution to our project.  No matter how large or small, we appreciate your support.  Remember the higher the donation, the greater the Perk.  Please take action and donate NOW!!   Please note: THE CITY THAT DONATES THE MOST MONEY TO THE CAMPAIGN WILL WIN THE GIFT OF THE EXHIBITION COMING TO THAT CITY FOR A SPEICAL EVENT FOR ALL DONORS.
But you can still help us in other ways than donating money…

<p>In the days of Top Chef and Hell’s Kitchen more and more home cooks are delving into the culinary arts. Without proper training, cooking and prepping food can be a dangerous undertaking. When looking at the kitchen gadgets being sold today, most are geared towards efficiency and unique cooking needs. This leaves an opportunity in the market to fill a gap with an item that focuses on safety. The S.V.P. is that item. Safe Veggie Prep is an innovative kitchen tool that will serve all markets including the professional industry. The S.V.P. is a second skin that will protect the most vulnerable fingers during the peeling, chopping, cutting and preparation process. No other product on the market can fulfill these claims.</p>
<p>Our mission is to assist and aid those who are not as confident as professional chef’s when it comes to the preparation of vegetables, fruit and other foods in the kitchen. Our product, Safe Veggie Prep or S.V.P., will ensure safety in the kitchen while chopping, cutting, peeling, dicing or slicing vegetables, fruit and other foods.  This unique tool is safe to be used by adults and older children with adult supervision.</p>
<p>There is nothing like this currently on the market. You cannot compare this to the bulky mesh cutting gloves being sold today. The S.V.P. covers only the fingers most vulnerable, features gripper fingertips, is dishwasher safe and extremely comfortable.  </p>

<p>Upcoming Challenges for final glove: </p>
<p> I have been diligently working for the past year to perfect the design and thoroughly develop all aspects of the S.V.P. Through trial and error we have chosen the best suitable material that is thin enough to allow flexibility while maintaining the strength to stand up to our rigorous safety testing. I know there will be challenges to come that we must surpass in order to succeed and I am confident we can do so.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL PROTOTYPE:  1 Additional prototype will be needed in the other 2 sizes being offered of the S.V.P. A portion of the funding will allow these key prototypes to be produced. All size variations are currently protected by my current patents.</p>
<p>WAREHOUSING: Our initial orders will ship directly off the product line but the need for an off site warehouse will be necessary once the S.V.P. becomes successful. We will need to find a warehouse in a good location that will provide adequate space.</p>

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>I have been making dolls for a dozen years and have enjoyed the happiness it provides children. I love it when I turn up at someone's house and their doll is loved to the point where its been loved to death like the Velveteen Rabbit! Years of hugging and kissing can do that to a doll.</p>
<p>Some children don't have dolls but need them more than the average child. Children who are abused and traumatized are comforted by a doll. They feel secure and settled. We all have ""off"" days and hugging a baby doll, especially one that is organic cloth, warm with soft wool, and scented with amazing essential oils, is more than comforting and relaxing. It's like spending a day at the spa!</p>
<p>When contributors support my project, they will be helping me introduce a new type of doll that, when it reaches the hands of abused and traumatized children, can have a lasting impact and help them on their way to healing.</p>
<p>I'm not alone in thinking that these dolls can be and are beneficial to children:</p>
<div>""Dolls have been a part of play therapy for a long time because the idea in play therapy is that the doll will represent part of the child's self which can then be externalized and difficult feelings or experiences can then be played out.""</div>
<div>      ~ Karen Fraley, Licensed Clinical Social Worker, Faculty Member, Intl. Psychotherapy Institute, Board Certified Diplomat in Advanced Clinical Work.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>""These dolls settle her. They make her feel secure. She doesn't go anywhere without them."" ~Nikki Weiser, parent to Alize</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need $5,000 to fully develop a template and then prototype for this doll. I have identified a design student that I would like to have help me in this venture. Together, we would perfect a doll that I have created, ""freestyle,"" and make an accurate pattern and directions so that other dollmakers can replicate the doll and so that it is perfect for larger production. The funds are needed to purchase all of the supplies to make 25 prototypes, the equipment/tools needed for creating the patterns, reproduction of the instructions and a stipend for the design student.</p>
</div>
<div>
<div>My mission is to help make a difference in the lives of children - those abused and traumatized. Underlying this is my intense passion to bring the Waldorf philosophy of the essential need for play to the greater public. Creating age-appropriate therapy dolls for children allows them to unleash their imagination, and for those who have been damaged, find wholesome ways to bring about healing.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For contributors, I have a host of fun and exciting perks that will show you just how much I appreciate your generosity and commitment in what I am trying to achieve. The top investors will get to name one version of the doll and help me decide on its various features! What a great way to recognize someone that you honor and love.</div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We've all heard gastly stories in the newspaper, on the news, and even from friends about the horrific abuse that occurs in our world, damaging children and changing their life forever. Years and years of therapy is often required to bring about healing.</p>
<div>I have a vision to create something unique - a heavy baby with limbs that is more suitable for an older child - five through ten - scented with special organic essential oils that have healing properties for emotionally bruised and abused people. According to the manufacturer, this is how they describe this special oil: ""SARA™ is an empowering blend of therapeutic-grade essential oils designed to help soothe deep emotional wounds. It may help individuals release and begin recovery from the traumatic memory of sexual and other forms of physical or emotional abuse."" Specifically, this oil is a combination of the following essential oils: Ylang ylang, geranium, lavender, orange, blue tansy, cedarwood, rose and white lotus in a base of almond oil.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>These top-grade oils are generously added to organic millet that has been gently warmed and fill the bottom of the doll, allowing her to sit. The doll's body is made with warm, organic 100 percent cotton. The size is such that it will fit into preemie baby clothing.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Doll therapy is very popular today but therapists don't have many choices when it comes to selecting all natural materials in their dolls. Therapy Babies will feel life like to help foster nurturing qualities in children. The warmth of the wool is healing and the weight is comforting. The simplicity of the features allow the imaginative life of the child to take flight. Every detail of this soft baby is made to inspire healing, creativity, and imagination. Some parents report that heavy babies are especially helpful when a child is transitioning to their own bedroom/bed or when a new sibling arrives. Some parents share that children with sensory processing disorders can be helped with weighted dolls to keep them still and calm.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Once the pattern is designed, I will create five different versions of the therapy doll representing a variety of ethnic groups and there will be a boy and a girl version. I will perfect and fine tune the doll until I am satisfied that I have achieved my goal of creating a beautiful doll that is made of the very best materials that will provide years and years of joy and therapeutic nurturing to all children who come in contact with it.</div>

<p> My twin boys have known this family for many years. They are good friends with all three of the boys.  </p>
<p>The family has not only been dealt with the blow of losing their mother last week to liver failure - she was 47 years old. Their father has suffered for many years with Lou Gehrigs disease. He is now in his final stage of life and was put in hospice a few days ago. These three boys will be left with no parents.</p>
<p>I have come to know the middle son ""Anthony"" very well the last couple months. He comes over to the house often and is such a well spoken boy and so genuine and sweet.   I have had a few long chats with  ""Anthony"". Through these chats I have learned what a very special boy he is. I am asking all of you to please consider helping me to collect money for this family.  </p>
<p>Recently, I had the opportunity to speak to Anthony and Troy and expressed my condolences to them and they expressed to me how the last couple of weeks have been. They have told me that they are going to stay in the rental house for the time being because their father's hospice is only minutes away. The younger son Troy has been home for two years looking after the father and he told me that he is going to be looking for a full time job now. Troy is my twin boys age (21). I expressed to them how sad I am for them and how its so tragic that they have this to go through and have had no option but to grow up very quickly in the last while.</p>
<p>Immediately when they left my home today I thought I have to do something for these boys.   I am just in the early stages of figuring out my other options for gathering donations. I am also considering how this money collected will be used for them - thinking purchasing grocery gift cards - gas cards - possibly contacting their landlord and paying a few months of their rent in advance. Many ideas to ponder - all money collected will be going to these boys basic needs in life. Christmas is just around the corner and what better reason to give to this family. All those that contribute I will include your name in the card to show these boys just how many people helped in their time of need. I AM HOPING THIS GOES VIRAL!!</p>
<p>Please share this link with your friends and family. The more attention to this cause the more success it will have!  Any amount of money even a few dollars will help - it will eventually add up to be a significant amount to make a difference and help these boys in their time of need. Please feel free to spread this story to others so they may consider donating also. Possibly some of you will be able to have your employer jump on board and become a donor to this family!!</p>

<p> </p></div>","My twin boys have known this family for many years. They are good friends with all three of the boys.  
The family has not only been dealt with the blow of losing their mother last week to liver failure - she was 47 years old. Their father has suffered for many years with Lou Gehrigs disease. He is now in his final stage of life and was put in hospice a few days ago. These three boys will be left with no parents.
I have come to know the middle son ""Anthony"" very well the last couple months. He comes over to the house often and is such a well spoken boy and so genuine and sweet.   I have had a few long chats with  ""Anthony"". Through these chats I have learned what a very special boy he is. I am asking all of you to please consider helping me to collect money for this family.  
Recently, I had the opportunity to speak to Anthony and Troy and expressed my condolences to them and they expressed to me how the last couple of weeks have been. They have told me that they are going to stay in the rental house for the time being because their father's hospice is only minutes away. The younger son Troy has been home for two years looking after the father and he told me that he is going to be looking for a full time job now. Troy is my twin boys age (21). I expressed to them how sad I am for them and how its so tragic that they have this to go through and have had no option but to grow up very quickly in the last while.
Immediately when they left my home today I thought I have to do something for these boys.   I am just in the early stages of figuring out my other options for gathering donations. I am also considering how this money collected will be used for them - thinking purchasing grocery gift cards - gas cards - possibly contacting their landlord and paying a few months of their rent in advance. Many ideas to ponder - all money collected will be going to these boys basic needs in life. Christmas is just around the corner and what better reason to give to this family. All those that contribute I will include your name in the card to show these boys just how many people helped in their time of need. I AM HOPING THIS GOES VIRAL!!
Please share this link with your friends and family. The more attention to this cause the more success it will have!  Any amount of money even a few dollars will help - it will eventually add up to be a significant amount to make a difference and help these boys in their time of need. Please feel free to spread this story to others so they may consider donating also. Possibly some of you will be able to have your employer jump on board and become a donor to this family!!

<h3>What Would You Do?</h3>
<p>When we started Raw Eats we were asked how we could help a customer and her father, her father had been diagnosed with cancer and had been prescribed a Raw Food Plant Based diet as way to over come it. Due to her having to work and not having the available resources to do this for him she was in desperate need of help.

<p>We see people with busy lives struggling to maintain a healthy, work/life balance we see the articles on healthy living but no one is serving these unadulterated foods needed, until now! </p>

<h3>Want more info about the Raw methods?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The foods we prepare need a lot of time and love, this includes sprouting, activating and slow dehydrating. This ensures the optimal nutrition can be provided from the foods. <span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Raw foods are not heated above 40 degrees (a really hot day), the reason is once the foods are heated above this the good enzymes are being cooked and killed, our bodies need these to get energy, vitality and to function properly.

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span></p>
<h3>Why do people need a meal plan?</h3>
<p>We know how difficult it can be to change eating habits, excuses are easy outs and making new and delicious foods day in day out are not in everyone skill sets. People are simply time poor to put the efforts into making healthy and organic dishes, people need time for themselves, family and friends, cooking, preparing delicious foods every meal is not convenient for many busy people. Raw Eats Meal Plan is convenient for so many reasons, money, time, less frustration and confusion, no need to compromise and this list goes on as well..</p>
<p>What choices are available to people who get home late or at odd hours? What happens when people are tired or cant make the healthy foods the body needs? They tend to go for the easy options which is junk, this starts a bad health cycle. </p>
<p>Other reasons the Raw food meal plan is needed:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>People don't have time to nourish themselves properly.</li>
<li>Quality is masked by marketing ploys, we don't know what we are consuming.</li>
<li>Fresh and delicious meals for breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks. </li>
<li>No more dependence on takeaways. </li>

<h3>If you heard of someone whom was gravelly ill, what could you do or say?</h3>
<p>You could say you helped get Raw Eats off the ground and that they offer the healthiest, tastiest foods and cleanest food around, the foods they make are prescribed by Doctors, Nutritionists and Healthcare Professionals. These professionals advise patients to eat a Raw Food Plant Based diet reason being is it's what we put in to our bodies that makes us either healthy or sick, everybody has heard the saying ""You are what you eat"", so if you eat the healthiest, cleanest and most nutritional foods available it is going to have some very positive effects on the mind, body and well being of that person. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">What happens if we don't get started now?</span><br/></p>
<p>It's simple, it means we cannot start helping people with their health, we do not want to say we cant help, ""yet"" any more. It is heart wrenching not having the resources to help. We have come so far already, help us get to the next step and be responsible for a positive change in ours, yours and others lives.</p>

<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
<p>Lowdown is a mobile application that dynamically pulls together highly relevant, context aware, company, personal, and industry information. Making preparation for meetings, interviews, and conference calls a breeze.</p>
<p><strong>Who is it for?</strong></p>
<p>Client facing professionals, interviewees, in fact any person that needs rich and pertinent information to prepare themselves for meetings. Sales, Recruitment, you?</p>
<p><strong>Why use it?</strong></p>
<p>Currently, to be well prepared for a meeting, you have to arduously research dozens of sources to gather the information required to be fully prepared.  With Lowdown, your mobile application does the heavy lifting, so you don't have to. </p>
<p><strong>The story behind Lowdown </strong></p>
<p>Spark33's founders have consulted for many FTSE100/Fortune500 companies during the last 25 years. Over the past 5 years they have been consulting enterprise businesses on mobile strategy and mobile applications.   </p>
<p>After listening closely to the common pains and challenges these businesses face (rather than just common business cases for apps), it became clear that employees could benefit from mobile-unique business productivity apps. </p>
<p>We slowly mapped out many features and applications that work to make everyday tasks not only easier, but more creative, more communicative, and better connected. Spark33 started talking about the idea in every client meeting, and after much intrigue, excitement, and unanimous interest in when such an application would be available, we realised we <em>had</em> to be the ones to build it.</p>
<p><strong>Where are we with it?</strong></p>
<p>The project has been carefully analysed, designed, technically &amp; functionally specified, and estimated during this year. The application has about 4 weeks left of initial design and user experience mapping before development of the minimum viable product (MVP) can commence. We'll keep backers close to the process with weekly newsletters on how it's all coming along.</p>
<p><strong>When can backers expect the releases?</strong></p>
<p>The application will be developed using agile development methodologies. This means that the first developer release can be expected after 8 weeks. This will be a fully tested demo, as all releases are, consisting of 4 features. After the initial iteration there will be a release every 2 weeks until the final release. We use this method of development to respond to rapid change, and as a backer, we would love your input in usability testing to analyse and refine the product. However involved you'd like to be, you'll be providing great insight just by using it.</p>
<p><strong>When can everyone have it?</strong></p>
<p>The first release will be available on the App Store at the beginning of next year, for both iPhone &amp; iPad, followed in the second half of 2014 with an Android version.</p>
<p><strong>How will the funds be spent?</strong></p>
<p>The funds will be spent on the development of the Lowdown iPhone &amp; iPad Apps, and on costs surrounding that development. Included in this is iOS and Web programming, project management, hosting, and personnel costs. All user business analysis, prototyping, solution design, user experience design, interaction design, and visual design is already covered.</p>
<p>£48,000 gets us, and you, the first release.</p>
<p>Any funds above £48,000 will be spent on the next App Store release which will further integration with popular business services, refine and strengthen the context and semantic engine, and incorporate user feedback with regards to usability and design aspects.</p>

</div></div>","What is it?
Lowdown is a mobile application that dynamically pulls together highly relevant, context aware, company, personal, and industry information. Making preparation for meetings, interviews, and conference calls a breeze.
Who is it for?
Client facing professionals, interviewees, in fact any person that needs rich and pertinent information to prepare themselves for meetings. Sales, Recruitment, you?
Why use it?
Currently, to be well prepared for a meeting, you have to arduously research dozens of sources to gather the information required to be fully prepared.  With Lowdown, your mobile application does the heavy lifting, so you don't have to. 
The story behind Lowdown 
Spark33's founders have consulted for many FTSE100/Fortune500 companies during the last 25 years. Over the past 5 years they have been consulting enterprise businesses on mobile strategy and mobile applications.   
After listening closely to the common pains and challenges these businesses face (rather than just common business cases for apps), it became clear that employees could benefit from mobile-unique business productivity apps. 
We slowly mapped out many features and applications that work to make everyday tasks not only easier, but more creative, more communicative, and better connected. Spark33 started talking about the idea in every client meeting, and after much intrigue, excitement, and unanimous interest in when such an application would be available, we realised we had to be the ones to build it.
Where are we with it?
The project has been carefully analysed, designed, technically & functionally specified, and estimated during this year. The application has about 4 weeks left of initial design and user experience mapping before development of the minimum viable product (MVP) can commence. We'll keep backers close to the process with weekly newsletters on how it's all coming along.
When can backers expect the releases?
The application will be developed using agile development methodologies. This means that the first developer release can be expected after 8 weeks. This will be a fully tested demo, as all releases are, consisting of 4 features. After the initial iteration there will be a release every 2 weeks until the final release. We use this method of development to respond to rapid change, and as a backer, we would love your input in usability testing to analyse and refine the product. However involved you'd like to be, you'll be providing great insight just by using it.
When can everyone have it?
The first release will be available on the App Store at the beginning of next year, for both iPhone & iPad, followed in the second half of 2014 with an Android version.
How will the funds be spent?
The funds will be spent on the development of the Lowdown iPhone & iPad Apps, and on costs surrounding that development. Included in this is iOS and Web programming, project management, hosting, and personnel costs. All user business analysis, prototyping, solution design, user experience design, interaction design, and visual design is already covered.
£48,000 gets us, and you, the first release.
Any funds above £48,000 will be spent on the next App Store release which will further integration with popular business services, refine and strengthen the context and semantic engine, and incorporate user feedback with regards to usability and design aspects.
Sorry, who are we?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Mai Bao Anh Truc is a 3 year old girl living in Vietnam. She is in the Hospital suffering of pneumonia and sinusitis.  She had been in and out of the hospital for over a month and shows no sign of recovery.  Because she lives in a poor part of Vietnam her treatment has be ineffective in curing her illness. The doctors are treating her illness as a bacterial infection and have not been able to cure her.  The problem is that the doctors do not have the tools to properly test for the cause of the illness.   She has had a high fever and vomiting and is now showing signs of weight loss and malnutrition.   Her vomiting has been so intense that it has caused her to pass out and received a concussion.  Also she has not been able to complete a full course of antibiotics and has been on and off medication due to a lack of money to purchase medicine.  This may have caused a resistant form of bacteria to develop which is why further treatments have been ineffective.  Her family is currently unable to continue to pay for treatments and she desperately needs to be moved to a private hospital, the French Vietnamese hospital in Saigon, for a proper diagnosis and treatment of her illness.</p>
<p>Her mother is a school teacher and her father works for the national railroad.  Their combined income is not sufficient to pay for all their hospital bills.  Her mother has not been able to work in order to take care of her in the hospital. They have had to go to local lending sources, equivalent to loan sharks, and borrow money.  Her mother has had to sell her motor bike to help pay for the hospital bills.  Even with help from family and friend they are very close to running out of money and are no longer capable of paying for treatment for this little girl. If they cannot find additional funding soon they will have to sell their house or the Truc will die.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>The $2000 being asked for is only enough to pay for the Hospital bill and for transportation to Saigon.  This is the minimum amount required to help her receive the treatment to cure her.   A hospital room and physiotherapy daily will cost $200+ a day.  Due to respiratory distress her oxygen saturations is less than 90% requiring her to be hospitalized.  She cannot recover at home.  </p>
<p>All the funds raised will go directly to the family to help pay their insurmountable bills.  Any additional money will be used to help other poor families in Phan Thiet that desperately need funds to help their sick children.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
This money will not only help save the life of Truc but will also allow her mother to get back to work and help the community.  Her mother is a selfless volunteer helping poor children get ahead in school. She has even helped raise children for families that have experienced tragedies and can no longer care for their kids.  This money will do a world of good in a very poor part of the world and will do more than save the life of this little girl.</div>
<div>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>The little girl with the red shirt in the image above is Truc.  Her name in Vietnamese means wish and gấu trúc is the word for panda.  She is our little panda bear that’s why I am using the purple panda as my avatar.  If you can donate $50 I will send you a purple panda T-shirt in any size you request.</p>

<h3>Fulton Street Books &amp; Coffee is Necessary</h3>
<p>Everyone deserves a place and  a space where they feel welcome. A space for community, community building, and conversations that push us towards better versions of ourselves. A space with a familiar face. An anchor space that feels like home. And that space is precisely what we are building. My name is Onikah, and I am the booklover and founder behind Fulton Street Books &amp; Coffee. After over a decade in the nonprofit sector, I am taking a leap and opening a new space - Fulton Street. Fulton Street is a space to call home. It is a space to build community and to change our city through civic discourse. It is a space on a mission to increase literacy, with people at the center of all the work that we do. It is a space for books, coffee, and a good time (and, yes, there is wine too). It is a space for Tulsans; Tulsans who have been longing for a space created with them in mind.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563087430/rwtmr2t2qnlyxo3s0kni.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Fulton Street is so much more than books &amp; coffee. Here are just a few issues that are core to our mission and vision:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Representation:</strong> A pain point for book lovers,  parents, and educators alike is finding and accessing literature that represents diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds. At Fulton Street, 70% of our books will feature or be written by authors representing a rich array of backgrounds, cultures, languages, voices, and narratives.</li>
<li>
<strong>Literacy</strong>: 31% of adults in Oklahoma function with basic literacy skills and 20% of Tulsans between the ages of 18-24 have less than a high school diploma. We are expanding the definition of literacy and reaching community in new ways through creative programming designed to ensure that more Tulsans have access to rich learning experiences that enhance literacy skills.</li>
<li>
<strong>Access:</strong> According to the Tulsa Equality Indicators Report, Black Tulsans are 3x more likely than white Tulsans to find it difficult to access resources, activities, and opportunities in Tulsa. Anecdotally, people of color in Tulsa often feel unwelcome and out of place in many mainstream establishments. Fulton Street is made with these Tulsans in mind. We will foster an inclusive environment and create a space for people to finally feel like they have walked into a space that was created with them in mind.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Okay, but is opening a bookstore risky?</strong></p>
<p>Fulton Street Books &amp; Coffee is a business, and like any business, comes with a certain amount of risk. But here is why we believe we will succeed in spite of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Believe the hype - independent bookstores are <u>thriving</u>. While Amazon gets points for convenience, independent bookstores offer what Ryan Raffaelli, an assistant professor at Harvard who studied independent booksellers, coined, the ""Three C's"": <strong>community</strong>, <strong>curation</strong>, and <strong>convening</strong>. Each of those c's are core to Fulton Street's mission and vision.</li>
<li>Community investment - businesses like Fulton Street rely on <strong>strong community investment </strong>to succeed<strong>. </strong>We have been diligently working on building our community over the past year. One way that we have started to build trust and community is through pre-opening gatherings  in The Heights, the neighborhood where we are primarily located. Pre-opening gatherings have allowed us to meet our neighbors and for community members to contribute to building the neighborhood bookstore and coffee shop they want for themselves and for their community.</li>
<li>Currently, neither The Heights, nor any of our adjacent neighborhoods; Owen Park, Cheyenne Park, Ben Hill, Crosbie Heights, Country Club, or Gilcrease Hills have a neighborhood coffee shop. No bookstore. No gathering place. <strong>Fulton Street Books &amp; Coffee is filling a void</strong>. We cannot wait to open our doors.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Let's Talk About Money</h3>
<p>Let's be real, fundraising is hard. Leaving a successful career is hard (and scary). But you want to know what makes it worth it? You. The people contributing to this campaign. The people who I could not, and would not want to do this without. Seriously.</p>
<p>I value every single dollar that you contribute. And as supporters, I believe that you deserve to know what your dollars are building. Fully funded, it will cost <strong>$250k</strong> to get Fulton Street up and running. I plan to raise <strong>$20k</strong> of that right here on Indiegogo. Here is what $20k will buy:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>A Point of Sale System (POS)</strong> - not sexy, but so necessary</li>
<li>
<strong>Inventory</strong> - stocking our shelves with all of the book titles we want and deserve. Non-book inventory will include all of the items that you didn't expect to find, but just can't leave behind. Like the prayer candle with Beyonce's face on it (yes- they exist and you will find them at Fulton Street)!</li>
</ul>
<p>If we exceed our goal, we will use the additional funds for added inventory, building our garden and patio area, and launching some of our programming.</p>

We want to continue to provide this kind of content for all of the OCR fans and those of you rooting for your friends and family.


ORM does get advertising dollars, but as a startup, we would love some help as we get growing.

Now is an opportunity to do what you can to help us so that we can tell the world about what goes on at this incredible event.

<h2><strong>What do homelessness, repurposing, and entrepreneurship have in common? CarryON!</strong></h2>
<p>According to the Massachusetts Coalition for the Homeless, there were over 16,000 people experiencing homelessness in Massachusetts alone. And chronic unemployment is what is trapping many people in homelessness. <strong>CarryON aims to end the cycle of homelessness with the power of green entrepreneurship</strong>. We create bags from repurposed materials <em>and</em> provide employment opportunities. Along with economic gain, jobs bring<strong> hope, dignity and real life social skills. </strong>We hope CarryON becomes a model for other social enterprises, inspiring manufacturing pods across the country and creating jobs for those who believe in the value of repurposing.</p>

<p>This summer, we begin our entry into the retail market, renting a booth at Boston’s Summer Street Art Market and launching an online marketplace at <a href=""http://www.carryonusa.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.CarryONusa.org</a>. We manufacture the bags in a workshop in Boston, and we have a supply of burlap, canvas, and linens, sourced from local coffee roasters and awning companies. As we begin this retail adventure, we are focusing on marketing our products and spreading our mission to repurpose.</p>
<p>We are asking for your support in expanding CarryON so that it can meet the employment needs of more people. Each new job changes a life and breaks the cycle. We want to prove that <em>both bags and people can find new lives.</em></p>

<h2><strong>How did CarryON begin?</strong></h2>
<p>Four years ago, a small group of St. Francis House guests sought help in building their path to economic independence.

<p>At CarryON, we know that <em>the homeless aren’t hopeless</em>, and we want to prove that there are ways to employ the chronically unemployed. </p>

<p>This campaign will fund the purchase of products associated to the hip-hop culture (vinyls, CD, DVD and books) in order to fill what you see in the picture underneath and offer a wider range of products to the clientele of the Hip-Hop Café. We will also go forward with some leasehold improvements, always with the objective to satisfy our supporters, our clients: bean bags to enjoy the music/vibe, listening stations, more furniture, etc. We are still in our start up (we opened on March 1st 2014) and really need your help to go to the next level and get where our true potential is. </p>

</p><p><span>•</span>One
year ago, PeaceKeeper Cause-Metics took a
direct hit from Hurricane
Sandy in New York. The warehouse
where we housed PeaceKeeper
filled up with five feet of water, flooded 95% of our inventory and destroyed our computers and paper
files. </p>
<p><span>•</span>We
received no disaster assistance due to loads of red tape and crazy
regulations!!</p>
<p><span>•</span>Even
our insurance agency left us high, and not-so-dry, claiming we didn’t have the
right kind of coverage despite paying over $30K in premiums over the past
decade.</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>The CAMPAIGN</b><br/></p>
<p><span>•</span>We
are raising $7,500 to get back in the game and show buyers that we can
overcome.  Our funds will go towards re-launching and improving our packaging so that our brand will be seen on par
with other upscale brands at Sephora or Ulta, especially in foreign markets. </p>
<p><span>•</span>We are working
with
a great distributor in Asia who will help us re-launch and grow by handling the marketing and
sales of our goods, if/when we deliver our new look.</p>
<p><span>•</span>If we
surpass our Indiegogo raise and reach $15,000, we will actually manufacture an
upscale line of lipsticks and lip glosses for distribution in
Asia. </p>
<p><span>•</span>We
are also committed to contributing 10% of all campaign dollars to Apne Aap women’s
charity (which helps young women out of high risk situations in which they are or can be forced into prostitution, into a sustainable trade. Visit <a href=""http://www.apneaap.org)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.apneaap.org)</a> and are also thrilled to be participating in Indiegogo's Giving Tuesday campaign.</p>
<p><span>•</span>If we
can hit $50,000 with Indiegogo,
we will introduce our new upscale lip line to very exclusive stores in the USA
and other upscale distributors overseas.  We have lots of plans if we can exceed
our goals and all along the way we’ll be helping women around the world who
live on less than a dollar a day. </p>
<p></p><p>Who needs
the US Government's “disaster assistance” or the insurance industry's excuses when we have a universe of friends like you?</p><p><span><b>THE PERKS</b>- </span></p><p><span>We are offering either gift boxes that you can give as gifts or donate to a charity of your choice for the Holidays or, if you are not into cosmetic gift boxes, some other perks that will engage you directly with your brand. For instance, how often in your life will you be able to name a product that will appear on the shelf at retail! Read the perks below and become a PeaceKeeper with us. </span></p><p><span><br/></span><b>THE GIFT BOXES - Here is a description of what you will find in the gift boxes!</b></p><p>With the Holidays &amp; New Year here, we can offer you fantastic gift boxes and other perks in
exchange for your donation. Buy gifts now or for birthdays and other events next year! PeaceKeeper products are made with organic ingredients and are not tested on animals. </p><p><b>HOW WE SOURCE INGREDIENTS - </b></p><p>We  source certain raw ingredients from developing world farmers to support them and their families. What we mean by this is that we work with bio-dynamic, organic farms in India, where the soil is not poisoned with pesticides. The fertilizer used is a ""living fertilizer"" made from cow dung, rosemary (used as a natural preservative), neem (used as an anticeptic), shell (for calcium), worms and other organic ingredients that create enough richness in the soil the farmers can get two to three crops a year as oppose to one crop.

Weiss, and I founded PeaceKeeper Cause-Metics (www.iamapeacekeeper.com) almost 11 years ago. PeaceKeeper is a For-Benefit company that gives donations to urgent human rights issues globally. PeaceKeeper is the activist beauty brand of the industry. We launched a lipgloss with the United Nations which gives donations to the UN's Trust Fund To Eliminate Violence Against Women. We have a lipgloss with Eve Ensler and her V-Day movement to end violence against women. We have a lipgloss called Fairness Gloss to advocate for a fair wage & we have a lipgloss called Eternal Equity Gloss which gives a dollar to women who live on less than a dollar a day. THE CHALLENGE
•One
year ago, PeaceKeeper Cause-Metics took a
direct hit from Hurricane
Sandy in New York. The warehouse
where we housed PeaceKeeper
filled up with five feet of water, flooded 95% of our inventory and destroyed our computers and paper
files. 
•We
received no disaster assistance due to loads of red tape and crazy
regulations!!
•Even
our insurance agency left us high, and not-so-dry, claiming we didn’t have the
right kind of coverage despite paying over $30K in premiums over the past
decade.The CAMPAIGN
•We
are raising $7,500 to get back in the game and show buyers that we can
overcome.  Our funds will go towards re-launching and improving our packaging so that our brand will be seen on par
with other upscale brands at Sephora or Ulta, especially in foreign markets. 
•We are working
with
a great distributor in Asia who will help us re-launch and grow by handling the marketing and
sales of our goods, if/when we deliver our new look.
•If we
surpass our Indiegogo raise and reach $15,000, we will actually manufacture an
upscale line of lipsticks and lip glosses for distribution in
Asia. 
•We
are also committed to contributing 10% of all campaign dollars to Apne Aap women’s
charity (which helps young women out of high risk situations in which they are or can be forced into prostitution, into a sustainable trade. Visit www.apneaap.org) and are also thrilled to be participating in Indiegogo's Giving Tuesday campaign.
•If we
can hit $50,000 with Indiegogo,
we will introduce our new upscale lip line to very exclusive stores in the USA
and other upscale distributors overseas.  We have lots of plans if we can exceed
our goals and all along the way we’ll be helping women around the world who
live on less than a dollar a day. 
Who needs
the US Government's “disaster assistance” or the insurance industry's excuses when we have a universe of friends like you?THE PERKS- We are offering either gift boxes that you can give as gifts or donate to a charity of your choice for the Holidays or, if you are not into cosmetic gift boxes, some other perks that will engage you directly with your brand. For instance, how often in your life will you be able to name a product that will appear on the shelf at retail! Read the perks below and become a PeaceKeeper with us. THE GIFT BOXES - Here is a description of what you will find in the gift boxes!With the Holidays & New Year here, we can offer you fantastic gift boxes and other perks in
exchange for your donation. Buy gifts now or for birthdays and other events next year! PeaceKeeper products are made with organic ingredients and are not tested on animals. HOW WE SOURCE INGREDIENTS - We  source certain raw ingredients from developing world farmers to support them and their families. What we mean by this is that we work with bio-dynamic, organic farms in India, where the soil is not poisoned with pesticides. The fertilizer used is a ""living fertilizer"" made from cow dung, rosemary (used as a natural preservative), neem (used as an anticeptic), shell (for calcium), worms and other organic ingredients that create enough richness in the soil the farmers can get two to three crops a year as oppose to one crop. That is called a ""LIVING SOIL"". We also source from US farmers who have received USDA or organic certification for the raw ingredients they sell (such as rosemary, spearmint & beeswax).We have four delicious gift boxes for you to choose from:Three Flavors of Our USDA CERTIFIED ORGANIC YUM BalmsThree of the following flavors will be included: Raspberry, Strawberry, Blueberry or CitrusRetail Price $36.00Indiegogo Price: $ 28.80, a 20% savingsGift Box, Ribbon & Gift Card IncludedOrder By December 18th to arrive in time for Christmas.FREE Shipping anywhere in the USA (Canadian & overseas orders will be charged shipping and we will contact you to approve the shipping rate).Three Flavors of ORGANIC MEGA BalmsThree of the following flavors will be included: Fair Trade Cocoa Chocolate, Organic Rose, Organic Spearmint or Organic Superfruit/BerryRetail Price $24.00Indiegogo Price: $20.00, a 20% savingsGift Box, Ribbon & Gift Card IncludedOrder By December 18th to arrive in time for Christmas.FREE Shipping anywhere in the USA (Canadian & overseas orders will be charged shipping and we will contact you to approve the shipping rate).Visionary Gift Box - Darker Skin TonesOne Darker Toned 75% Organic Lipstick, Empowered or Mysterious (perfect for brunettes or darker skin tones or taste)One Sheer Red VDay or Sheer Burgundy UNIFEM Lip Gloss with 75% Organic IngredientsProvocative Nail Polish - Real Holiday Red - Lasts 5-7 days with a top coat!Made without harmful Toluene, Formaldehyde, Acetone, Phthalates, Parabens, DBP'sRetail Price $30.00Indiegogo Price: $24.00, a 20% savingsGift Box, Ribbon & Gift Card IncludedOrder By December 18th to arrive in time for Christmas.FREE Shipping anywhere in the USA (Canadian & overseas orders will be charged shipping and we will contact you to approve the shipping rate).Diplomat Gift Box - Lighter Skin TonesOne Lighter Toned Lipstick, Loving or Oh So Sexy (perfect for blondes or lighter skin tones or tastes)One Sheer Baby Pink Women For Women or Sheer Fairness Lip GlossProvocative Nail Polish - Real Holiday Red - Lasts 5-7 days with a top coat!Made without harmful Toluene, Formaldehyde, Acetone, Phthalates, Parabens, DBP'sRetail Price $30.00Indiegogo Price $24.00, a 20% savingsGift Box, Ribbon & Gift Card IncludedOrder By December 18th to arrive in time for Christmas.FREE Shipping anywhere in the USA (Canadian & overseas orders will be charged shipping and we will contact you to approve the shipping rate).THE VALUES FOR YOU

To encourage them to break down barriers and limiting beliefs before they become an ingrained part of their personality.</div>

<p>Youth today are experiencing an increased level of stress.

<p>Possible Effects of Stress in Children</p>
<p>   • 30% of tweens and 42% of teens say they get headaches. However, only 13% of parents reported being aware of their children having headaches.</p>
<p>   • 39% of tweens and 49% of teens report difficulty sleeping. However, only 13% of parents reported being aware of their children having trouble sleeping.</p>
<p>   • 25% of tweens and 39% of teens reported eating too much or too little due to stress. However, only 8% of parents reported being aware of this issue.</p>
<p>Teen Pregnancy has increased:</p>
<p>“Girls with low self-esteem often base their self-worth on being in a romantic relationship, despite the quality [of it],” says Richard Shadick, Ph.D., director of the counseling center at Pace University. “Girls who do not value themselves tend to accept poor treatment from boyfriends, in part, because they have few supports in their life.”</p>
<p>Other issues include low grades, lack of concentration, getting into trouble or fights and much more.</p>
</div>
<div>
<br/><h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p>Our mission is to add value and empower as many youth and parents as we can. We are Confidence Coaches trained by a premier life coaching institution. Our values based coaching style mixed with educational programs and workshops instill life long skills and behaviours that lead to confidence and self-esteem.</p>
<h3>Why we're doing this</h3>
<p>Do you hear a voice in your mind that is mean to you? I used to.  In fact, I know many people who have heard this voice. My voice used to tell me I was fat. He was telling me this to protect me, make it okay that I had some weight issues. I had heard this voice since I was a young girl. He was born with my bully back in grade school, and he didn’t die until I made the choice at 38. He lived for 30 years. RIP.</p>
<p>A few months ago I was talking with a 10 year old neighbour. She is one of the kindest, most loving people I know. Suddenly a few minutes into our conversation, she got very quiet and I saw a tear run down her face.</p>
<p>She said, “Jenn, I’m fat. I need to go on a diet.” Astounded that a 10 year old would be worrying about these things I asked her why she thought that. She said that she heard it inside of her all of the time. After a bit of digging, I realized that she too had been called fat by a number of people in her life. Those voices stuck with her just like they had with me.</p>
<p>Although it was a difficult thing to hear, I realized right then and there that something had to be done.  As Gandhi says <em>“A man is but a product of his thoughts, what he thinks, he becomes.""</em></p>
</div>
<h3>What We Need<br/><br/>Our mission is to empower youth with confidence and self-esteem through education and coaching. We have created a 10 week program dubbed SpringBoard Confidence Project for both boys and girls ages 10-13.This interactive program is designed to be both a web-based program and a live program. </h3>
<p>This is where we need your help! We need to raise $20,000 to get this program launched both online and in the classroom.  In order to help as many youth as we can, we would like to be able to offer this program in the classrooms for free, or at least at cost. In order to attain these goals, we need some start up capital.</p>
<p>To keep accountable to you we commit to providing updates of our efforts, challenges, achievements and successes through this site and our website <a href=""http://www.confidenceconnectioncoaching.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.confidenceconnectioncoaching.com</a>. As supporters of the program we will periodically email you directly (if you wish) with free strategies and tips on how to support the mission in your own areas of influence and share ideas we get through the implementation of the mission.</p>
<p>We guarantee your money is going to a great cause! The money raised will be used for marketing and running programs focused on getting to as many kids as possible.  We plan on a full scale internet marketing campaign to get the word out, and to build and print our workbook and other resources for use in the classroom.</p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We love whiskey. We love whiskey so much, we want to make it every day. In an effort to do so, we've started Alley 6 Craft Distillery. We're a small batch distillery aiming to produce some of the finest rye, wheat, and bourbon whiskey. By participating in our campaign, you will help us get off the ground and make us the first distillery in Healdsburg, California. </span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>We'll strive to make sure that every step in the process is sustainably and responsibly managed, and all of our spirits are made using the best organic grain sourced as locally as possible. We're taking the whole process in-house every step of the way to ensure the highest quality product. We've teamed up with the City of Healdsburg as the pilot project to showcase the way forward for the local distilling industry. Some of the ways we will reduce waste is to give the left over grain to the local farmers to feed the livestock, while the used barrels will be turned into various items such as planters, furniture, and lighting. In the end, this will allow us to make a quality artisan whiskey, while helping our community. . . which makes us happy. </p>
<p>We began to develop an interest in beer and winemaking after moving to Northern California. Jason started slinging drinks at a steakhouse where they sell some of the best whiskies in the world and soon fell head first into the craft-distilling arena. We began attending tastings and shows, touring local distilleries, and eventually going on a life-changing trip to Scotland. We knew this was our life’s passion and could be happy making whiskey every day. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">This has been a dream in the making and it gets so much closer to being a reality each and
every day. There has been so much research and hands on education, as well as
an abundance of support from our family, friends, and advisors to get us to
where we are today. </span>We want to make this dream come true and need some help in doing so. </p>

<h3><strong>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</strong></h3>
<p>For the past couple of years, we've been taking on extra jobs and scraping up every cent in order to purchase whatever we can within our means. However, making hand-crafted whiskey is a costly endeavor and there are a lot of hoops to jump through, as you can imagine. We've gotten as far as we can on our own and now here we are, we need help.</p>
<p>Now that we've moved into our warehouse we're itching to launch, but there's still a lot of work to do. Your donations will help us get our facility up to date and purchase materials for the first few batches to actually start producing. The total amount we are looking for is upwards of $50,000; however, we are hopefully setting a more achievable goal of $10,000 to get us started. We will be ecstatic if we surpass our goal because every bit counts! The additional dollars will go towards increasing production amounts, purchasing new equipment, and building out our tasting room. All of your support is greatly appreciated and will be well used.</p>
<p>With that being said, we have some great perks to share with you for your donations of $25 and up, although all donations are welcome! So please check 'em out and help us get this barrel rolling!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, we realize most of you will be wondering why you don’t see free bottles delivered to your door as a gift. Hold your horses, we aren’t actually legally allowed to provide these items yet. Well, that’s no fun. But rest assured, once we get up and running you will be able to drink our delicious whiskey soon enough! We will do our best to reward you for your contributions. <br/></p>

(Krystle & Jason Jorgensen)
We love whiskey. We love whiskey so much, we want to make it every day. In an effort to do so, we've started Alley 6 Craft Distillery. We're a small batch distillery aiming to produce some of the finest rye, wheat, and bourbon whiskey. By participating in our campaign, you will help us get off the ground and make us the first distillery in Healdsburg, California. 

We'll strive to make sure that every step in the process is sustainably and responsibly managed, and all of our spirits are made using the best organic grain sourced as locally as possible. We're taking the whole process in-house every step of the way to ensure the highest quality product. We've teamed up with the City of Healdsburg as the pilot project to showcase the way forward for the local distilling industry. Some of the ways we will reduce waste is to give the left over grain to the local farmers to feed the livestock, while the used barrels will be turned into various items such as planters, furniture, and lighting. In the end, this will allow us to make a quality artisan whiskey, while helping our community. . . which makes us happy. 
We began to develop an interest in beer and winemaking after moving to Northern California. Jason started slinging drinks at a steakhouse where they sell some of the best whiskies in the world and soon fell head first into the craft-distilling arena. We began attending tastings and shows, touring local distilleries, and eventually going on a life-changing trip to Scotland. We knew this was our life’s passion and could be happy making whiskey every day. This has been a dream in the making and it gets so much closer to being a reality each and
every day. There has been so much research and hands on education, as well as
an abundance of support from our family, friends, and advisors to get us to
where we are today. We want to make this dream come true and need some help in doing so. 
We've moved in to an awesome location and plan to start production in the beginning of 2014. We invite you to share in our dream! Your contributions will help us get off the ground and be able to start producing. We promise to make you proud.

<h3>Since I was five years old I have known in my heart that I wanted to live at an orphanage and help kids who didn't have families (I don't know where this idea came from although I'm pretty sure Mister Rogers had something to do with it!)</h3>
<p>I am finally making that goal happen and am heading to Tanzania, Africa for 10 weeks to volunteer at the Forever Angels Baby Home the 27th of January.</p>
<p>I am hoping you can help.</p>
<p>All it takes is <strong>just one drink</strong>, one latte, tea, frappacino, beer, cocktail. Take the pocket money you would spend on just one drink this weekend and donate it. It's that simple. The money I raise will help supply water, food, medical supplies to kids who have absolutly nothing. If you would like to donate more, this is how far your money can go....</p>
<p><strong>$5</strong> will diaper a baby for an entire week.</p>
<p><strong>$8</strong> will pay for a months supply of clean water for child</p>
<p><strong>$20 </strong>will pay for a child to see a Doctor in the hospital and be treated for a life threatening illness such as pneumonia or malaria. <em>That's just $20 to literally save a life.</em></p>
<p><strong>$40</strong> will feed eight kids 30 days and stop them from feeling constant hunger.</p>
<p><strong>$130</strong> would pay a nurse's salary to care for the children at the baby home for an entire month.</p>
<p><strong>$160</strong> will pay for a entire family to rent a room for ONE YEAR! That enables a family who wants to adopt to have somewhere to call home.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><strong>You only have until Monday January 14th to contribute so PLEASE DONATE NOW! It will take 5 minutes and could save a life....</strong></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Baby Home houses up to 50 babies and children who have been abondened and have no family to care for them. They run souly on donations and anything helps.</p>

</h3><p>The Lemong'o Project became a registered 501(c)3 non-profit  in 2011, although the work with the Maasai people of Lemong'o began several years prior in 2007. Through the years the  village has gone through struggles and successes and continues on a path of positive change. The Lemong'o Project strives to work with the community in partnership and is committed to create sustainable solutions to their education, health, nutrition, and employment needs. We are currently fundraising in hopes to transition towards sustainability for the Lemong'o Project and the people it serves.<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/509135/files/20140414221323-DSC_0058.JPG?1397538803"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p>          <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/509137/files/20140414221417-DSC_0891.jpg?1397538857"" src="""" style=""width: 242.485px; height: 362px;""/>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/509139/files/20140414221503-DSC_0361.jpg?1397538903"" src="""" style=""width: 239.994px; height: 361px;""/></p> <br/>

When the school lunch program was initiated, there were approximately 225 students enrolled.  Currently there are over 500 students enrolled. Our school lunch budget ($850 per month) has remained the same despite the school's enrollment doubling. As a result, the amount of food each student receives has been cut in half. School lunches are provided to students each day and for many students this is their only meal of the day.  </span></h4><h4 style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; font-weight: normal;""><span style=""color: rgb(116, 27, 71);""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/487643/files/20140406093118-DSC_1068.jpg?1396801878"" src="""" style=""width: 156.667px; height: 235px;""/><span style=""line-height: 20px;"">   </span></span><span style=""color: rgb(116, 27, 71);""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/487640/files/20140406092937-DSC_1067.jpg?1396801777"" src="""" style=""width: 136.251px; height: 237px;""/>  </span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/524296/files/20140421220758-Screen_shot_2014-04-21_at_9.07.23_PM.png?1398143278"" src="""" style=""width: 173.188px; height: 238px;""/></span></h4><p><br/></p><h4>Education - Teacher's Salaries <br/>
</h4>
<p>Eleven teachers at Belgrove K-8 school serve over 500 students. The Kenyan government only provides and pays for three out of the eleven teachers. The remaining eight teachers are local community members, many of whom have grown up in Lemong'o. Parents are responsible for those teachers' salaries. Unfortunately the vast majority of parents are unable to pay the tuition in full. Consequently, teachers are often only partially paid and children are frequently sent home for not paying their tuition. This is very disruptive to their education. Currently the Lemong'o Project pays half the salaries for the eight non-government teachers ($350 monthly, roughly $40 a month per teacher). Without these non-government teachers, there would only be three government teachers instructing over 500 students.       </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/487748/files/20140406103055-DSC_1312.JPG?1396805455"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><h4>Health - Medical Clinics</h4><h4></h4><p>Medical clinics are provided twice a year by  the Lemong'o Project and are open to all in the village and surrounding areas.  Frequent medical concerns include: malnutrition, malaria, skin 
diseases (the result of poor hygiene due to lack of access to water,) 
dental issues, goiters, at risk child birth and burns from cooking fires.  Since 2011, approximately 2,300 people have been treated and over 200 
people have been supported for follow-up medical referrals.  Also included in the Lemong'o Project medical clinics are vision screenings by an optometrist.  In addition, vision screenings are held for all children at the school.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445183544/hhsnhhjufatokfmfzgsb.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 364.056px; height: 245px;""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445183879/n6ytldayrdjth4hpoyyz.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 247.773px; height: 276px;""/></p><p><br/></p><h4>Employment - Economic Development <br/>

primarily self-funded,  largely operating
on “friends and family” donations and our first ever crowdfunding campaign.  With this type of hand-to-mouth funding, the Project’s programs are subject to great uncertainty every year.  Consequently, much of our organizational leadership time is devoted to fundraising, rather than sustainability and expansion of services. <br/></p><p>With your help in reaching our campaign goal, The Lemong'o Project will be able to continue to meet the immediate needs of the village while simultaneously working on long term strategic planning

deepen the services we can provide to the beautiful people of Lemong'o.</p><p><br/></p><h4>The Big Picture - Where's the money going?<br/>

stepping stones in becoming a more sustainable non-profit.Because of our first success, we've extended our Indiegogo campaign and are currently ""InDemand,"" which allows us to continue fundraising even though our first campaign is over.  With your support, we hope to raise an additional $10,000O!  Our Indiegogo site shows what was earned during 
our last drive, combined with what has been raised 
this year making it appear that we have met our goal already - but we 
still have a long way to go. Please consider helping
 us meet our current goal!                  About Us
The Lemong'o Project became a registered 501(c)3 non-profit  in 2011, although the work with the Maasai people of Lemong'o began several years prior in 2007. Through the years the  village has gone through struggles and successes and continues on a path of positive change. The Lemong'o Project strives to work with the community in partnership and is committed to create sustainable solutions to their education, health, nutrition, and employment needs. We are currently fundraising in hopes to transition towards sustainability for the Lemong'o Project and the people it serves.             
Our Immediate NeedsNutrition - School Lunches Before the school lunch program was started, students were often too weak to walk to school or would fall asleep in class due to undernourishment. When the school lunch program was initiated, there were approximately 225 students enrolled.  Currently there are over 500 students enrolled. Our school lunch budget ($850 per month) has remained the same despite the school's enrollment doubling. As a result, the amount of food each student receives has been cut in half. School lunches are provided to students each day and for many students this is their only meal of the day.       Education - Teacher's Salaries 

Eleven teachers at Belgrove K-8 school serve over 500 students. The Kenyan government only provides and pays for three out of the eleven teachers. The remaining eight teachers are local community members, many of whom have grown up in Lemong'o. Parents are responsible for those teachers' salaries. Unfortunately the vast majority of parents are unable to pay the tuition in full. Consequently, teachers are often only partially paid and children are frequently sent home for not paying their tuition. This is very disruptive to their education. Currently the Lemong'o Project pays half the salaries for the eight non-government teachers ($350 monthly, roughly $40 a month per teacher). Without these non-government teachers, there would only be three government teachers instructing over 500 students.       Health - Medical ClinicsMedical clinics are provided twice a year by  the Lemong'o Project and are open to all in the village and surrounding areas.  Frequent medical concerns include: malnutrition, malaria, skin 
diseases (the result of poor hygiene due to lack of access to water,) 
dental issues, goiters, at risk child birth and burns from cooking fires.  Since 2011, approximately 2,300 people have been treated and over 200 
people have been supported for follow-up medical referrals.  Also included in the Lemong'o Project medical clinics are vision screenings by an optometrist.  In addition, vision screenings are held for all children at the school. Employment - Economic Development 
The Lemong'o Project aims to support economic 
development within the village.  A future goal is to provide small 
micro finance loans to villagers, especially to women, which will begin to 
create sustainability.  We are confident
 that with this support the people of Lemong'o will apply their strong 
work ethic to develop successful small businesses.      Why we need your help nowSince its inception, The Lemong'o Project has been
primarily self-funded,  largely operating
on “friends and family” donations and our first ever crowdfunding campaign.  With this type of hand-to-mouth funding, the Project’s programs are subject to great uncertainty every year.  Consequently, much of our organizational leadership time is devoted to fundraising, rather than sustainability and expansion of services. With your help in reaching our campaign goal, The Lemong'o Project will be able to continue to meet the immediate needs of the village while simultaneously working on long term strategic planning
to expand programs, secure predictable revenue sources, and improve
organizational infrastructure. This will allow us to broaden and
deepen the services we can provide to the beautiful people of Lemong'o.The Big Picture - Where's the money going?
Your donation will help us keep our monthly commitments (lunches, teacher salaries and medical clinics) with the people of Lemong'o, while allowing us to transition towards true sustainability.   The Lemong'o Project is a registered 501(c)3 non-profit foundation. The funds collected for this project are going directly to benefit the people of Lemong'o.              Your gift will go a long way
$10 pays for one child, K-8, to attend school in the village for one year

$30 provides basic clinic supplies and medicine for ten people

$40 will pay for half a teacher's salary for one month
$100 provides hot school lunch for 450 students for three days

When you go to work the most important thing for you is that you get paid and paid correctly. Its also important that you are employed properly with a contract and that your employer pays your tax for you. Its all about workers rights and being able to sleep at night. Thats what we do.

I can be a bit of a stickler for 'the rules' and doing things right, especially when it come to looking after employees. It is top of my list. Thats why I am passionate about this business. I know of too many cases where business pay people under the table or fail to pay their tax. Its not good for the employees, its not good for the economy and it causes all sorts of social issues and abuses of staff. 


By investing here today you will help us build a business that looks after people in work. You will be part of something special. It also means that the government gets its tax revenue, employees get the protection they need and employees have piece of mind they are acting ethically. Please read on....

What We Need & What You GetBreak it down for folks in more detail:
We need funding for two things marketing and staffing. I have worked in this industry for a long time and know the model is solid. I also know some fantastic people that I want to employ. They share the vision, goals and most importantly the ethical ethos of the business. 
Marketing- I know what we have is special, revolutionary and brilliant! I need some investment to tell the world! I'd like to make our website a little more user friendly. I'm like to advertise (I'd really like to shout it from the rooftops but I think Google may work better.) We also need to talk to a lot of people, quite a few in the USA and those phone calls are not cheap! Your investment will really make a difference.

We want our investors at all levels to be part of the business and to be part of its success. Along with the perks offered I am also happy to offer my personal advice and help to anyone investing in us. From a simple payroll question to help on an employment dispute I am at your service.
Your investment gives you a range of perks that are listed on the right, from a mug to an equity stake. All investors also get a discount on our professional fees.
The great thing about our funding goals is that they are scalable. That means if we don't reach our target I'll be calling more people and advertising less. Anything you invest WILL make a difference.
The ImpactI see a world where people work hard, get paid well and give back to society. We have the system already in the Uk and the western world through taxation. We have experience of working in these markets already. We want to make sure that in these countries things are done right all of the time putting the employee first. 
We want to champion employee rights globally. We want to lobby governments to protect workers and in return allow them to tax those wages (Win Win). We all know of the Bangladesh disaster at the textile factory. This should not ever happen. Empowering workers globally will ensure that this does not. 

I have managed and helped many companies and workers in recent years to act responsibly. I have set up operations in Hungary that gave the working mothers maternity leave, sick pay and paid holiday. All things denied to them by there previous working arrangement. The company was happy to do this as well as they know they now have a happier more stable workforce. 

I hope you can see the value in our vision and share it. If you want to know more or have any questions at all please contact me directly. Paul@peoworldwide.com.

<div>
<p>Hearts for Kenya is focused on “teaching for a lifetime” one rural community, Oyugis, Kenya, East Africa. By sharing modern agricultural practices with the citizens of Oyugis, the people are learning to be self-sufficient while raising their standard of living. Hearts for Kenya firmly believes that not only do the people of Oyugis become self-sufficient and are able to survive without being provided for, but they have a sense of achievement and fulfillment.</p>
<p>When Hearts for Kenya was first formed, Oyugis farms were yielding about 300 pounds of corn per acre. There was no significant ongoing fertilization, irrigation or crop rotation. There were no animals or machines to pull a plow. <strong>Sixty percent of the children of Oyugis were infected with HIV. </strong>Starvation and infection were the leading causes of death. Waterborne infectious diseases were spreading freely among the people. The few public buildings and churches that existed, being built of mud and sticks, were not durable.</p>
<p>Although dire conditions remain, significant progress has been made in Oyugis since 1997 due to the efforts of Hearts for Kenya and the initiative of the local people. Corn crop yield has been increased from 297 pounds to over 1,263 pounds per acre. There is now enough corn grown locally to sustain the local populace, with some left over from each harvest to sell. Significant progress has also been made in irrigation, fertilization and farming methods.</p>
<p>Although the recent drought has ended, the problems of <strong>malaria, TB and AIDS remain rampant.</strong> Local people are exercising enough leadership and initiative to sustain the gains made thus far. However, they will require much additional time and help in order to have a chance to overcome the various other barriers to survival that are characterized by the extreme poverty. Hearts for Kenya is ready and willing to continue providing that help, and it needs a continual flow of resources in order to accomplish that goal. </p>
<p>While the primary mission of Hearts for Kenya is the development of a farming cooperative, the medical needs of the co-op community are integral to their ability to have better lives.  In an effort to improve the community’s access to affordable, reliable and convenient health care, <strong>Hearts for Kenya has developed plans for a medical clinic that can serve the co-op families.</strong>  By involving the community members in the clinic plans, we have been able to proceed with a concept that will be self-sustaining.</p>

Yaku is the organizer of a growing 40+ members  community of artists and art groups from around the world. The Organization will draw artists from the international community to curate cultural festivals within the HMC. Between festivals Yaku will offer the HMC for use as a rental facility.

The building stayed empty until a couple purchased it from the neighborhood in the early 2000’s. They had plans to turn the building into a small chapel for weddings and their home.

The couples were unable to come to an agreement and the owners then lost the building to the City.

The Organization is acting as a Benefit Corporation. It exists to oversee the restoration, repurposing, and management of the historic Hale Memorial Church (HMC), located at 401 West High Street, Peoria, IL. Yaku is the organizer of a growing 40+ members  community of artists and art groups from around the world. The Organization will draw artists from the international community to curate cultural festivals within the HMC. Between festivals Yaku will offer the HMC for use as a rental facility. Yaku will also actively engage the youth through school collaborations and outreach programs to promote community participation and cultural involvement.Floors and DoorsFloors and Doors is the first restoration initiative of Yaku.   For years the Hale Memorial Church has been unattended to; this project is the first act to reclaim the space. Floors and Doors is series of simple preservative gestures to stabilize the church. These gestures include: 
Rebuilding the doors - to allow safe and secure movement in and out of the space.

Repairing the floors -  portions of the floor have been damaged by various elements, repairing these areas would allow for safe movement throughout the church. 

Clearing the space - over the years the church has accumulated debris varying from old building materials to garbage from previous inhabitants. Clearing this out will create a bigger and brighter space. 
The Envelope - To keep the elements out; resources will be spent on sealing the envelope, this includes: patching roof, boarding windows, repairing holes in the gutters, etc. 
Money from the Floors and Doors campaign will go to preserving the space and creating the momentum needed to take the project into the future.E + N = FoundersThe Founders of Yaku are Earl Power Murphy and his wife Natalia Villanueva Linares.

rights interests and anti-corruption issues, acting as a nonpartisan liaison group between
the government and the Khmer people. As a group HROTP assists in a wide range of human rights cases, ranging from human trafficking and rape to enabling rural people have access to medical care in Phnom Penh and housing development projects for the underprivileged. 
In the late 1970s the Khmer Rouge
banned private property, destroying thousands of land documents. As
a result, many Cambodians lack the proper land titles to the property they own. This often results in the illegal sale or eviction of people from the lands that they rightfully own. The Cambodian government has been selling
Cambodian people’s land to foreign investors for monetary gain with little
regard for the land rights of the Cambodian people, taking away their homes and
their livelihoods with little to no compensation. According to the rights group
Licadho in 2013, 400 000 people have been affected by land grabbing and land
disputes since 2003.

Also bin ich ausgezogen, um den Grundstein dafür zu legen. Ich habe eine Ausbildung zur Hotelfachfrau gemacht und bin dann nach Neuss gezogen. <br/><p>Leider ergab sich hier keinerlei Möglichkeit für mich, meinen Traum weiter zu verfolgen und ich habe eine weitere Ausbildung zur Informatikkauffrau gemacht. Ich hatte einen Chef, der mir immer gesagt hat, dass man hart arbeiten muss, um seine Ziele zu erreichen. Die 11 Jahre bei ihm waren sehr schwer. Ich hatte Neider, Gönner, Unterstützer. In den letzten beiden Jahren war ich sehr oft kurz davor meine Kündigung einzureichen und einfach zu gehen. Ich wollte einfach nur noch nach Hause. Zu meiner Familie. Es hatte sich in den Jahren so entwickelt, dass ich nur 2 Mal im Jahr bei meiner Familie sein konnte und das Abschiednehmen fällt jedes Mal schwerer. Zu sehen, dass ich Vieles verpasse, dass ich Vieles gar nicht mitbekomme und das ich in schweren Zeiten nur telefonisch bei ihnen sein kann, lässt mich oft frustriert in der Ecke sitzen.</p><p>Weihnachten, im Dezember 2012, haben meine Familie und ich zusammengesessen und über Gott und die Welt geplaudert. Irgendwann kamen wir auf das Thema: ""Was ist aus unseren Träumen geworden"". Wir landeten schnell bei dem kleinen Restaurant mit kleiner Zimmervermietung oben drüber und begannen zu überlegen, wo man dieses Projekt in Weißwasser umsetzen könnte. Ich landete auf einem unbebauten Gelände und begann zu ""spinnen"". Ich habe auf großen Blättern aufgemalt, wie ich mir mein Restaurant vorstelle. Mit einer großen Glasfront, sodass man sehen kann, was los ist. Mit genügend Parkplätzen, sodass man das Auto auch gern mal stehen lassen kann, wenn es doch länger wird. Mit einer Terasse draussen, damit man im Sommer den Kaffee an der frischen Luft genießen kann und mit viel Grün drumherum, sodass die Natur zum Entspannen einlädt. <br/></p><p>Leider stellte sich schnell heraus, dass ein solcher Neubau nicht zu finanzieren ist. Also ging ich bei Maklern und im Internet auf die Suche nach geeigneten, leerstehenden Immobilien. Selbst beim Bürgermeister habe ich gefragt, ob es Gebäude gibt, die dafür in Frage kommen. Gleichzeitig suchte ich mir direkt vor Ort einen Unternehmensberater, der mich vor Ort unterstützt, da ich ja die meiste Zeit in Neuss bin. </p><p>Mein Berater war direkt begeistert von meiner Idee und meinem bereits vorhandenen Businessplan und sagte mir seine vollste Unterstützung zu. Wir fanden ein Lokal (direkt am Marktplatz), welches die große Glasfront hat. Welches die Möglichkeit für einen kleinen Biergarten hat, wo direkt nebenan genügend Parkplätze sind und zur Krönung auch noch viel Grün drum herum ist. Es steht der Businessplan, auch mit dem Vermieter ist alles geklärt, mit einer Brauerei hatte ich bereits Termine, um alles zu besprechen. Der Fliesenleger hat ein tolles Angebot 
gemacht, um wieder Flair in die Immobilie zu bekommen. Ich habe 2 Studenten die mich beim Corporate Design und der 
Inneneinrichtung unterstützen.<br/></p><p>Nun sind wir nach etwas mehr als einem Jahr Planung schon soweit, dass eine Bank ihre Unterstützung zugesagt hat. Jedoch sind Banken bei Gastronomie-Projekten sehr zögerlich. Ich kann einen Kredit über den Großteil des Geldes aufnehmen. Aber leider scheitert mein Traum an 15.000 Euro, welche ich einfach nicht selbst aufbringen kann. Für dieses Geld wird der Gastraum neu hergerichtet und die Bar neu und modern aufgebaut. Auf dem Bild wird deutlich wie dringend notwendig das ist.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/370233/files/20140214101948-Wand_neue_Theke_2.JPG?1392401988"" src="""" style=""width: 568px; height: 426px;""/></p>Es wird eine Mischung aus Steakhaus und Eventgastronomie. Alt und Jung sollen einen Ort zum Wohlfühlen haben. <p>Der einzige Jugendtreffpunkt der Stadt wurde geschlossen. Ich möchte, dass Jugendliche wieder einen Anlaufpunkt haben und nicht auf der Straße hocken müssen. Ideen hierfür wären eigene Teenie-Nachmittage. Es gibt Schülerbands, welche bei diesen Nachmittagen auftreten können und somit bekannter werden.</p><p>Freitags ist Wochenmarkt auf dem daneben liegenden Marktplatz. Man kann sich nach dem Einkauf auf eine Tasse Kaffe oder ein Mittagessen treffen.</p><p>Mittags gibt es besondere Angebote, die täglich wechseln, damit es immer interessant bleibt. Und das zu günstigen Preisen. Futtern wie bei Muttern ist hier die Devise.</p><p>Am Abend wird das Speisenangebot an die amerikanische Küche angelehnt. Steaks, Burger, Spare Rips und Ähnliches dürfen da nicht fehlen. Und an Wochenenden gibt es immer wechselnde Angebote, wie zum Beispiel: Motto-Partys, Krimidinner, Vorlesungen, Poetry-Slam, auch mal einen Bingo-Nachmittag und und und. Den Ideen sind hier kaum Grenzen gesetzt.</p><p>Ich möchte ein Anlaufpunkt sein, wo sich Alle wohlfühlen, gern hinkommen und auch gern mal länger bleiben.<br/></p><p>Und genau an der Stelle kommt Ihr ins Spiel. Helft mir bitte, dass ich meinen Traum leben kann und zwar an der Seite und mit der Unterstützung meiner Familie. Macht meine Kampagne bekannt. Teilt sie mit Freunden, Bekannten, Verwandten.<br/></p><p>Natürlich sollt Ihr dabei nicht leer ausgehen. Ich stelle Euch gern folgende Perks zur Auswahl:</p><p>1. Ein dickes Dankeschön.

Therefore I departed to set the foundation stone for <br/>that. I made an education the hotel business and was used then according <br/>to Neuss.</p><p>Unfortunately, no possibility resulted here for me, to keep on <br/>tracing my dream and I made a further education the computer business. I <br/>had a boss who always said to me that one in a hard way must work to reach its <br/>goals. The 11 years with him were very hard. I had enviers, patron, <br/>supporter. In the last two years it was to submit I very often shortly before my <br/>cancellation and simply to work. I simply only want to got home. To my family. It had <br/>expanded in the years so, that I could be only 2 time in the year near my family <br/>and the departure-taking falls each time more heavily. To see that I miss many <br/>things, that I do not realize many things at all and that I can be only by <br/>telephone in hard times with them lets to me often frustrated in the edge <br/>sit.</p><p>Christmas, in December 2012, my family and I sat together and <br/>speak about God and the world. Sometime we came on the topic: ""What became <br/>from our dreams"". We landed quickly near the Small restaurant with small room <br/>rental above about that and we began to consider where one could convert this <br/>project in Weißwasser. I landed on an undeveloped ground and began too ""are <br/>daft"". I painted on big end nodes as I imagine my restaurant. With a big glass <br/>front, so that one can see what is rid. With sufficient parking spaces, so that <br/>one can make be the car once also gladly if nevertheless it becomes longer. With <br/>a Terasse outside, so that one can enjoy the coffee <br/>in the summer at the fresh air and with a lot green around, so that the nature invites to the relaxation. <br/>Unfortunately, it turned out quickly that such a new development is not to be <br/>financed. Therefore I went with brokers and in the Internet onto the search for <br/>suitable, vacant real estate. Even with the mayor I asked whether there are <br/>buildings which come into consideration for that. Simultaneously I searched <br/>myself directly on site for a management consultant who supports me on site <br/>since I am most time in Neuss.</p><p>My consultant was directly inspired by my idea and my already <br/>existing business plan and promised me its fullest support. We found a <br/>restaurant (directly at the marketplace) which has the big glass front. Which <br/>one has the possibility for a small beer garden, where are sufficient parking <br/>spaces directly next door and for the coronation a lot is also still green <br/>around for that. It is the business plan, also with the landlord is clarified <br/>everything, with a brewing I already had appointments to discuss everything. The <br/>craftsman made a fabulous offer to get atmosphere into the real estate again. I have  2 students with me and they´re supoorting me with the Corporate Design and the interior fitting. Now we are planning already so far after a little more than one year that a bank confirmed their support. However, banks are with gastronomy-projects very hesitant. I can take up a loan in the large part of the money. However, unfortunately my dream fails because of 15.000 Euros which I can simply not deposit myself. For this money the guest room is prepared new and the bar newly and in a modern way based. <br/>On the Screen it becomes clear how that is urgently necessarily.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/374706/files/20140216224727-Bild_WSW.png?1392619647"" src="""" style=""width: 568.62px; height: 427px;""/></p><p>A mix becomes from steak house and event gastronomy. Old and <br/>young should have a location for feeling well. The <br/>only youth club of the city was closed. I would like that adolescents <br/>must have a starting item again and sit not on the street. Ideas for that would <br/>be own Teenie-afternoons. It gives to pupil bands which ones with these afternoons can occur and become thus better known. On Fridays is weekly market on the marketplace lying in addition to that. One can meet after the purchasing onto a cup godforsaken place or a lunch. </p><p>At noon there are special offers, which switch daily so that it remains always interesting. And that to favorable prices. At the evening the offer is leaned against the American kitchen. Steaks, Burger, Spare rips and similar may not be missing. </p><p>And at weekends there are always switching offers, such as: Partys, thriller dinners, <br/>lectures, Poetry-Slam, also once a bingo afternoon and so on.<br/>There are no limits for ideas. </p><p>I would like to be a starting item where They All feel well, get gladly and remain also gladly once longer. </p><p>And exactly at the position it´s you turn :-)</p><p>Please help me, that I can live my dream and in fact at the page and with the <br/>support of my family.

Also bin ich ausgezogen, um den Grundstein dafür zu legen. Ich habe eine Ausbildung zur Hotelfachfrau gemacht und bin dann nach Neuss gezogen. Leider ergab sich hier keinerlei Möglichkeit für mich, meinen Traum weiter zu verfolgen und ich habe eine weitere Ausbildung zur Informatikkauffrau gemacht. Ich hatte einen Chef, der mir immer gesagt hat, dass man hart arbeiten muss, um seine Ziele zu erreichen. Die 11 Jahre bei ihm waren sehr schwer. Ich hatte Neider, Gönner, Unterstützer. In den letzten beiden Jahren war ich sehr oft kurz davor meine Kündigung einzureichen und einfach zu gehen. Ich wollte einfach nur noch nach Hause. Zu meiner Familie. Es hatte sich in den Jahren so entwickelt, dass ich nur 2 Mal im Jahr bei meiner Familie sein konnte und das Abschiednehmen fällt jedes Mal schwerer. Zu sehen, dass ich Vieles verpasse, dass ich Vieles gar nicht mitbekomme und das ich in schweren Zeiten nur telefonisch bei ihnen sein kann, lässt mich oft frustriert in der Ecke sitzen.Weihnachten, im Dezember 2012, haben meine Familie und ich zusammengesessen und über Gott und die Welt geplaudert. Irgendwann kamen wir auf das Thema: ""Was ist aus unseren Träumen geworden"". Wir landeten schnell bei dem kleinen Restaurant mit kleiner Zimmervermietung oben drüber und begannen zu überlegen, wo man dieses Projekt in Weißwasser umsetzen könnte. Ich landete auf einem unbebauten Gelände und begann zu ""spinnen"". Ich habe auf großen Blättern aufgemalt, wie ich mir mein Restaurant vorstelle. Mit einer großen Glasfront, sodass man sehen kann, was los ist. Mit genügend Parkplätzen, sodass man das Auto auch gern mal stehen lassen kann, wenn es doch länger wird. Mit einer Terasse draussen, damit man im Sommer den Kaffee an der frischen Luft genießen kann und mit viel Grün drumherum, sodass die Natur zum Entspannen einlädt. Leider stellte sich schnell heraus, dass ein solcher Neubau nicht zu finanzieren ist. Also ging ich bei Maklern und im Internet auf die Suche nach geeigneten, leerstehenden Immobilien. Selbst beim Bürgermeister habe ich gefragt, ob es Gebäude gibt, die dafür in Frage kommen. Gleichzeitig suchte ich mir direkt vor Ort einen Unternehmensberater, der mich vor Ort unterstützt, da ich ja die meiste Zeit in Neuss bin. Mein Berater war direkt begeistert von meiner Idee und meinem bereits vorhandenen Businessplan und sagte mir seine vollste Unterstützung zu. Wir fanden ein Lokal (direkt am Marktplatz), welches die große Glasfront hat. Welches die Möglichkeit für einen kleinen Biergarten hat, wo direkt nebenan genügend Parkplätze sind und zur Krönung auch noch viel Grün drum herum ist. Es steht der Businessplan, auch mit dem Vermieter ist alles geklärt, mit einer Brauerei hatte ich bereits Termine, um alles zu besprechen. Der Fliesenleger hat ein tolles Angebot 
gemacht, um wieder Flair in die Immobilie zu bekommen. Ich habe 2 Studenten die mich beim Corporate Design und der 
Inneneinrichtung unterstützen.Nun sind wir nach etwas mehr als einem Jahr Planung schon soweit, dass eine Bank ihre Unterstützung zugesagt hat. Jedoch sind Banken bei Gastronomie-Projekten sehr zögerlich. Ich kann einen Kredit über den Großteil des Geldes aufnehmen. Aber leider scheitert mein Traum an 15.000 Euro, welche ich einfach nicht selbst aufbringen kann. Für dieses Geld wird der Gastraum neu hergerichtet und die Bar neu und modern aufgebaut. Auf dem Bild wird deutlich wie dringend notwendig das ist.Es wird eine Mischung aus Steakhaus und Eventgastronomie. Alt und Jung sollen einen Ort zum Wohlfühlen haben. Der einzige Jugendtreffpunkt der Stadt wurde geschlossen. Ich möchte, dass Jugendliche wieder einen Anlaufpunkt haben und nicht auf der Straße hocken müssen. Ideen hierfür wären eigene Teenie-Nachmittage. Es gibt Schülerbands, welche bei diesen Nachmittagen auftreten können und somit bekannter werden.Freitags ist Wochenmarkt auf dem daneben liegenden Marktplatz. Man kann sich nach dem Einkauf auf eine Tasse Kaffe oder ein Mittagessen treffen.Mittags gibt es besondere Angebote, die täglich wechseln, damit es immer interessant bleibt. Und das zu günstigen Preisen. Futtern wie bei Muttern ist hier die Devise.Am Abend wird das Speisenangebot an die amerikanische Küche angelehnt. Steaks, Burger, Spare Rips und Ähnliches dürfen da nicht fehlen. Und an Wochenenden gibt es immer wechselnde Angebote, wie zum Beispiel: Motto-Partys, Krimidinner, Vorlesungen, Poetry-Slam, auch mal einen Bingo-Nachmittag und und und. Den Ideen sind hier kaum Grenzen gesetzt.Ich möchte ein Anlaufpunkt sein, wo sich Alle wohlfühlen, gern hinkommen und auch gern mal länger bleiben.Und genau an der Stelle kommt Ihr ins Spiel. Helft mir bitte, dass ich meinen Traum leben kann und zwar an der Seite und mit der Unterstützung meiner Familie. Macht meine Kampagne bekannt. Teilt sie mit Freunden, Bekannten, Verwandten.Natürlich sollt Ihr dabei nicht leer ausgehen. Ich stelle Euch gern folgende Perks zur Auswahl:1. Ein dickes Dankeschön. Für 10,00 Euro kommt Ihr an die Danke-Wand in dem Lokal. Dort werden alle Unterstützer namentlich genannt. Und wenn Du es schaffst auch persönlich vorbei zu kommen, gibt es oben drauf eine dicke Umarmung von mir :-)2. Freigetränk. Für 25,00 Euro bekommst Du bei Deinem ersten Besuch ein Glas Deines Lieblingsgetränkes und selbstverständlich auch die dicke Umarmung. Und auch Dein Name kommt an unsere Wand.3. Ein Mal Mittagstisch: für 50,00 Euro bekommst Du ein Gericht vom Mittagstisch und ein Glas Deines Lieblingsgetränkes. Und natürlich kommt Dein Name an die Wand und die Umarmung ist nicht zu vergessen.4. Du bekommst für 100,00 Euro 10 % Rabatt auf unsere Speisen bei Deinem ersten Besuch (max. 4 Personen). Und natürlich kommt Dein Name an die Wand und die Umarmung ist auch dabei.5. Für 150,00 Euro gehst Du zu unserem Koch und kreierst Deinen eigenen Burger (Er muss genießbar sein), der eine Woche lang unter Deinem Namen auf unserer Karte steht. Außerdem erhältst Du 10 % Rabatt auf unsere Speisen bei Deinem ersten Besuch (max. 2 Personen). Und natürlich kommt auch Dein Name an die Wand und die Umarmung ist auch dabei.6.

Für 500,00 Euro kommst Du mit einer Begleitperson Deiner Wahl bei uns Essen (es sind inkl.: 2 Hauptgänge nach Wahl, 1 Flasche passenden Wein, 1 Flasche Wasser). Und auch hier kommt Dein Name an die Wand und die Umarmung ist auch dabei.8.

Therefore I departed to set the foundation stone for that. I made an education the hotel business and was used then according to Neuss.Unfortunately, no possibility resulted here for me, to keep on tracing my dream and I made a further education the computer business. I had a boss who always said to me that one in a hard way must work to reach its goals. The 11 years with him were very hard. I had enviers, patron, supporter. In the last two years it was to submit I very often shortly before my cancellation and simply to work. I simply only want to got home. To my family. It had expanded in the years so, that I could be only 2 time in the year near my family and the departure-taking falls each time more heavily. To see that I miss many things, that I do not realize many things at all and that I can be only by telephone in hard times with them lets to me often frustrated in the edge sit.Christmas, in December 2012, my family and I sat together and speak about God and the world. Sometime we came on the topic: ""What became from our dreams"". We landed quickly near the Small restaurant with small room rental above about that and we began to consider where one could convert this project in Weißwasser. I landed on an undeveloped ground and began too ""are daft"". I painted on big end nodes as I imagine my restaurant. With a big glass front, so that one can see what is rid. With sufficient parking spaces, so that one can make be the car once also gladly if nevertheless it becomes longer. With a Terasse outside, so that one can enjoy the coffee in the summer at the fresh air and with a lot green around, so that the nature invites to the relaxation. Unfortunately, it turned out quickly that such a new development is not to be financed. Therefore I went with brokers and in the Internet onto the search for suitable, vacant real estate. Even with the mayor I asked whether there are buildings which come into consideration for that. Simultaneously I searched myself directly on site for a management consultant who supports me on site since I am most time in Neuss.My consultant was directly inspired by my idea and my already existing business plan and promised me its fullest support. We found a restaurant (directly at the marketplace) which has the big glass front. Which one has the possibility for a small beer garden, where are sufficient parking spaces directly next door and for the coronation a lot is also still green around for that. It is the business plan, also with the landlord is clarified everything, with a brewing I already had appointments to discuss everything. The craftsman made a fabulous offer to get atmosphere into the real estate again. I have  2 students with me and they´re supoorting me with the Corporate Design and the interior fitting. Now we are planning already so far after a little more than one year that a bank confirmed their support. However, banks are with gastronomy-projects very hesitant. I can take up a loan in the large part of the money. However, unfortunately my dream fails because of 15.000 Euros which I can simply not deposit myself. For this money the guest room is prepared new and the bar newly and in a modern way based. On the Screen it becomes clear how that is urgently necessarily.A mix becomes from steak house and event gastronomy. Old and young should have a location for feeling well. The only youth club of the city was closed. I would like that adolescents must have a starting item again and sit not on the street. Ideas for that would be own Teenie-afternoons. It gives to pupil bands which ones with these afternoons can occur and become thus better known. On Fridays is weekly market on the marketplace lying in addition to that. One can meet after the purchasing onto a cup godforsaken place or a lunch. At noon there are special offers, which switch daily so that it remains always interesting. And that to favorable prices. At the evening the offer is leaned against the American kitchen. Steaks, Burger, Spare rips and similar may not be missing. And at weekends there are always switching offers, such as: Partys, thriller dinners, lectures, Poetry-Slam, also once a bingo afternoon and so on.There are no limits for ideas. I would like to be a starting item where They All feel well, get gladly and remain also gladly once longer. And exactly at the position it´s you turn :-)Please help me, that I can live my dream and in fact at the page and with the support of my family. Make my campaign known. Share this with friends, acquaintances. Of course you are not supposed to go out in this case emptily. I forward you Perks following gladly for the selection: 1. A big thank you. For 10,00 euros comes her at the thanking-wall in the restaurant. There all supporters are specified in particular.

<h3>The End to an Amazing Journey</h3>
<p>As I conclude my journey overseas, I'm so happy to say that I will be contributing to a worthwhile cause. I will be traveling to Fez, Morocco to work with the local community on improving the economy through promoted tourism. I will be writing for ""The View from Fez"", a reputable blog run by an Australian couple. I will be covering the Fez World Music Festival forums held in the morning. This will give me the opportunity to write on meaningful discussions such as the Arab Spring and financial crises around the world as well as inform readers that the festival is not just about sharing music culture but also ideas on the world we live in today. The link is available here for the blog - <a href=""http://riadzany.blogspot.fr/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://riadzany.blogspot.fr/</a></p>

I will be traveling to Fez, Morocco to work with the local community on improving the economy through promoted tourism. I will be writing for ""The View from Fez"", a reputable blog run by an Australian couple. I will be covering the Fez World Music Festival forums held in the morning. This will give me the opportunity to write on meaningful discussions such as the Arab Spring and financial crises around the world as well as inform readers that the festival is not just about sharing music culture but also ideas on the world we live in today. The link is available here for the blog - http://riadzany.blogspot.fr/


How You Can Help
The funding needed for the trip is extraneous to the loans I am eligibal for in Paris therefore I am humbly asking for your help and support. I will be needing 600 euros to finance my time in Fez which will include the following:

Housing
Food
Transportation
Internet access
Phone access

Please feel free to contact me privately should you want additional information.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>So so so... this is what I need...</h3>
<p><br/>For years now I have been teaching my sewing classes in my living room. Cosy, comfortable, relaxed, and it puts people at ease. But, and this is a big but, it is a small living room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So I can only teach 3 people at a time, and even then it is a constant ""can I just get past you"", "" can you move a little so I can get to the cupboard"" whilst I am teachig, and all not having family dinners at the table ever and using the ever present ironing board as an extra table, my 5 year old playing with the sewing machines as they are all over our space (I have about 12). Also I have cats. Some peopel don't liek them and they make some people sneeze. They sleep on my fabric. It would really help if I coud offer a space without cat hair.</p>
<p><br/>So I need to move. I need to also stay close to the home. I have 6 cats, 3 kids, and I love working from home. I don't want to commute. I just need more space. I have lots of space in my garden. Lots.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So I can build a studio in my garden. One that can hold all my sewing machines, my fabric, my iron, my books, my patterns, my rulers. One than can comfortably hold 6 or 7 students (and an ironing board). This will give me back our living room (we miss it badly).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So I have looked into costs. I don't need anything fancy. Not a home office. Just a grand dry shed really. I can decorate, insulate, and carry stuff. I cannot build, lay foundations or put in electrics. For that I need help. And money.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So with a little help from you I can start reclaiming my living space and start teaching in a dedicated space. It will make a huge difference not just to my business but also to my family. We haven't eaten at a table for almost three years...</p>
</div>
<div>So I need specifically:</div>
<div>about £1500 for a shed</div>
<div>about £600 for electrics to go out to the shed</div>
<div>about £200 for furniture (tables, chairs, shelving)</div>
<div>about £100 for lighting both inside the shed and along the path to the garden</div>
<div>About £100 for the insulation</div>
<div>about £500 to pay someone to build the shed for me</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If I don't make the full amount I will still build the studio. It will just take me a lot longer, and I was really hoping to get it done this summer. But any help is good. It is not just about money. You can do electrics and want to help? Great. You can help me take down the old shed? Fab. You are able and happy to lay foundations. I will love you for ever.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>What's in it for you</h3>
<p><br/>so what is in it for you? Other than good karma? Well, lots.</p>
<p>If you can donate £25 I will make you a funky bespoke mini quilt/ potholder/ mug rug</p>
<p>If you can donate £100 I wil enroll you for two free classes of your choosing</p>
<p>If you can donate £150 I will make you a unique 45x60"" quilt</p>
<p>If you can donate £250 I will make you a personalized double bed quilt</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>My Golden Birthday is right around the corner and many of you have asked me how to help make this one special.... Enter this campaign!</h3>
<p>""At 30 you finally start to catch up to those dreams you’ve been chasing for the last 10 plus years.""<br/>~Bonnidette Lantz</p>
<p>Like most people I had some pretty firm ideas of where I was going to be once I got around to the ripe ol' age of thirty. The usual stuff... marriage, house, kids, etc etc. My twenties had some very different ideas in mind and am I glad they did.</p>
<p>Last May, as I blew out 29 sparkling candles, it hit me that this would be my last year in my twenties... I better make it good! Apparently 'making it good' meant a lot of really big changes. This last year has been a major growing experience and I've gained a lot of clarity and serenity around where my life is headed.</p>
<p> I set 2 goals for myself before I reach the big 3-0 and I'm almost there...</p>
<p>Goal #1- Complete all exams and requirements to obtain my massage license.<br/>  Needed: To pass the last practical board exam and pay for my license</p>
<p>Goal #2- Register and train for a Spartan Race later this summer.<br/>  Needed: Training underway, just need to register<br/>P.S. If you haven't heard of the Spartan Race, I highly recommend checking it out! <a href=""http://www.spartanrace.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.spartanrace.com</a> </p>
<p>As I look around my life, I'm eternally grateful for the people in it and all the love and support you all have shown me. Help me reach my goals and start my thirties out on a great note! And then come to Portland, do the Spartan Race with me and then I'll give you a massage! :)</p>
<p>Thank you, thank you, thank you! <br/>Much, much love and gratitude,<br/>xoxo<br/>Dana</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is AshEl ""Seasunz"" Eldridge. As a green jobs and food justice organizer, a hip-hop performer and climate educator in high schools, and a witness to my grandmother passing away from diabetes when I was just an young boy, I know <strong>food and nutrition</strong> are a nexus point connecting climate change, food security, obesity, hunger, and poverty. Food can lead to economic development, particularly in communities of color, and healing in a world increasingly inundated with chemicals, nutritionally deficient food products, and environmental degradation.</p>
<p><strong>SOS Juice, is a solar-powered for-profit/non-profit hybrid that will sell juice, smoothies, and compost in order to improve health, promote sustainable agriculture, and create green jobs for low-income youth and the formerly incarcerated individuals.</strong></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, I know <strong>food and nutrition</strong> are a nexus point connecting climate change, food security, obesity, hunger, and poverty. Food can lead to economic development, particularly in communities of color, and healing in a world increasingly inundated with chemicals, nutritionally deficient food products, and environmental degradation. SoS Juice can change this.</p>
<p>SOS Juice, in which the SOS stands for 'System out of our System', is <a href=""https://ashel-eldridge.squarespace.com/education/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a monthly food justice and health equity event</a> inspired by Occupy, the Black Panthers free breakfast program, and Indigenous Wisdom and sacred ceremony.</p>
<p>These<a href=""https://ashel-eldridge.squarespace.com/education/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> events </a>have been powerful and have featured acclaimed artist and national speakers. However, I saw that in order for a deeper healing and transformation to happen, SoS Juice had to become a bigger ongoing business model that could provide jobs AND access to a healthier lifestyle. </p>
<p>These realizations prompted us to go into business. Sos juice is for everyone with a stomach.

<p>SOS juice will also support the waste reduction of existing food businesses, by participating in both the creation and networking of existing<a href=""https://ashel-eldridge.squarespace.com/kitchens"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> commercial kitchens</a> focused on food recovery, food processing and distribution.</p>

My name is AshEl ""Seasunz"" Eldridge. As a green jobs and food justice organizer, a hip-hop performer and climate educator in high schools, and a witness to my grandmother passing away from diabetes when I was just an young boy, I know food and nutrition are a nexus point connecting climate change, food security, obesity, hunger, and poverty. Food can lead to economic development, particularly in communities of color, and healing in a world increasingly inundated with chemicals, nutritionally deficient food products, and environmental degradation.
SOS Juice, is a solar-powered for-profit/non-profit hybrid that will sell juice, smoothies, and compost in order to improve health, promote sustainable agriculture, and create green jobs for low-income youth and the formerly incarcerated individuals.
To launch our business we need your help. We will pilot our idea in Oakland, Ca to prove the benefits of the model and out potential to grow nationwide. Our Goal is to set up the first official SOS Juice Booth this spring but we need support form like minded people like you to raise about 10K to make it happen.

The Impact
As I mentioned earlier, I know food and nutrition are a nexus point connecting climate change, food security, obesity, hunger, and poverty. Food can lead to economic development, particularly in communities of color, and healing in a world increasingly inundated with chemicals, nutritionally deficient food products, and environmental degradation. SoS Juice can change this.
SOS Juice, in which the SOS stands for 'System out of our System', is a monthly food justice and health equity event inspired by Occupy, the Black Panthers free breakfast program, and Indigenous Wisdom and sacred ceremony.
These events have been powerful and have featured acclaimed artist and national speakers. However, I saw that in order for a deeper healing and transformation to happen, SoS Juice had to become a bigger ongoing business model that could provide jobs AND access to a healthier lifestyle. 
These realizations prompted us to go into business. Sos juice is for everyone with a stomach. Customers will not only improve their own health, getting a good dose of their daily requirements of fruit and veggies in a cup, but also improve the health of communities impacted by poverty and the lack of access to healthy food and education by buying juice and smoothies via farmers markets and food trucks.
SOS juice will also support the waste reduction of existing food businesses, by participating in both the creation and networking of existing commercial kitchens focused on food recovery, food processing and distribution.

<p>For each Alter Ego duo you purchase, a water charity will bring fresh and clean water to someone in need. The more you purchase, the more you become part of the change. It's as simple as that!</p>

<p>Ecofiltro: one is a 501(c)(3) public charity who delivers filters to rural communities in a sustained manner that creates clean water for life.</p>
<p>They reach rural communities by partnering with local community leadership, educating them about the importance of clean drinking water. Whether they get water from a natural spring, rain run-off, or contaminated well, the goal is to help villagers understand the health benefits of filtered water. They know the only way to do this sustainably is to organize communities to take control of their own health the same way affluent nations do.</p>

<p>We listened to what you had to say and we worked very hard to bring you what we've all been waiting for: a portable, personal, intelligent water bottle with an outstanding design and first class water filtration technology!</p>
<p>And since we know that you care so much about the world around you, we designed this new product to help people in developing countries get access to clean water. Alter Ego’s purpose is to help reduce the inequity of clean water access in the world. Right from the start, we want every sale of an Alter Ego Duo to help someone less fortunate to gain access to clean water.</p>

<h2><strong>Alter Ego satisfies your thirst for water</strong></h2>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Alter Ego</strong> is a personal water filtration and hydration duo made of two components: <strong>Alter</strong>, the bottle and <strong>Ego</strong>, the water filter assembly. It was designed to accommodate the urban traveller and the outdoor enthusiast on a day expedition, as well as the humanitarian worker in a developing country, for which access to clean water is a matter of survival.</p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">The Alter Ego duo is your perfect hydration companion,</span>reminding you to drink water daily and taking away the excuse of not drinking enough water:  The powerful filtration technology allows for the treatment of any questionable source of fresh water; from a chlorinated water source in the city to a dirty river in a foreign country.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The Alter Ego duo is also a must have in case of natural disaster. When the power goes off and the water supply becomes unsafe, <span class=""s2"">your Alter Ego duo guarantees you a reliable and steady personal water supply. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt=""Alter Ego family"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://aquaovo.com/Aquaovo/images/stories/AlterEgo/indiegogo/Alterego_family_580.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<div class=""template asset""><em>The Alter Ego prototype with packaging concept.</em></div>
<p> </p>
<p class=""p1"">Made of safe and tough, BPA-free, Eastman Tritan copolymer, the <strong>Alter</strong> bottle is a premium choice in terms of personal hydration. Its seamless V-shaped trigon design allows for a grip that fits all hand sizes<span class=""s1"">.  The unique shape will fit most cup holders and it prevents the bottle from rolling away!</span> Designed to open on both ends, <strong>Alter</strong> is easy to wash and its wide mouth opening allows the use of ice cubes. It’s the perfect way to enjoy clean and fresh water with no metallic aftertaste. It can be purchased and used with or without the <strong>Ego</strong> water filter assembly.</p>
<p>Capacity: 700 ml – 24 oz</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>The <strong>Ego </strong>water filter assembly combines beautiful design, top-quality components, and state-of-the-art water filtration technology. Primarily designed to perfectly fit the <strong>Alter</strong> bottle, it can also be used separately, as the silicone spout adapter has been designed to fit most of the wide mouth bottle brands available on the market.</p>
<p>Equipped with EPA-approved filtration technology made in the USA by <a href=""http://revolvewater.com/?page_id=5120"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Revolve</a>, our filter cartridge is designed to filter out contaminants up to six logs (99.9999%) and renders clean water that is free of chemical and organic contaminants, as well as viruses, bacteria and cysts. This means you can instantly drink water worry-free from nearly any fresh water body in the world. The filter cartridge is available in three different models: Tap, Outdoor (99.99%) and Advanced Outdoor (99.9999%). The filtration capacity varies upon the model. Tap: up to 200 gallons (750 liters) Outdoor: up to 200 gallons (750 liters) Advanced: up to 75 gallons (285 liters).</p>

<h2 class=""template asset"">The Alter Ego packaging concept</h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Initially </span><span class=""s2"">developed</span> by creative agency <a href=""http://www.circodebakuza.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Circo De <span class=""s3"">Bakuza</span></a>, the Alter Ego packaging concept is a <span class=""s3"">reflection of</span> the water situation in the world <span class=""s4"">today</span>. The Alter bottle and the Ego water filter assembly are packaged individually but they depend on each other to achieve their end goal. The faces on the boxes represent both the <span class=""s3"">people in areas of the world who have plenty of access to clean water and the people from areas of the world where having access to clean water is still a daily struggle</span>. They need each other to be whole and functional. <span class=""s2"">There will be 12 sets of faces on the triangular shaped box.  6 haves and 6 have nots. The 6 have nots each represent the one person in six who doesn't have access to clean water</span>. <span class=""s4"">The faces</span> <span class=""s3"">represent</span> the whole human race gathered to solve the world water crisis when assembled in a complete circle of six boxes.</p>

<h2>What are the $$ for?</h2>
<p class=""p8""><strong>EVERY ALTEREGO DUO PURCHASED = CLEAN WATER FOR SOMEONE IN NEED<br/></strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">The rest of the money raised here on Indiegogo wiil fund the tooling, the first production run &amp; distribution so we can make sure you will get your Alter Ego on time for the hot season. Additional money will go <span class=""s1"">towards</span> marketing efforts to expand the Alter Ego movement.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Manufacturing</strong> - We know you want your Alter Ego duo as soon as possible. We are already working on the production cycle and we need the money to get this first run manufactured and shipped ASAP!</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Distribution</strong> - Our mission is to empower consumers to change the world.  As such, we want to make Alter Ego available anytime, anywhere and for everybody. To do so, we want to extend our distribution channels through ecommerce plateforms such as <a href=""http://Fab.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""s2"">Fab.com</span></a> and retail outlets such as Macy's, Target, Costco, <span class=""s3"">Eddie Bauer, Anthropologie etc. many of which we already have existing relationships</span>. </p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Marketing</strong> - YOU are the most inportant link between Alter Ego and the rest of the world.  In order to grow the movement and change the world faster, we need you to tell your friends/family and the easiest way to do that is through social media: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/aquaovo"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""s4""><strong>POST ON FB</strong></span></a>, <a href=""http://clicktotweet.com/dRffc"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""s4""><strong>TWEET</strong></span></a>, <a href=""http://youtu.be/kbJ94wkB5oU"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""AQUAOVO on youtube!"">SHARE THE VIDEO</a> &amp; <a href=""http://pinterest.com/aquaovo/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""s4""><strong>PIN A PHOTO</strong></span></a>!  </p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Growth</strong> - This is only the beginning. As the Alter Ego movement growes, we want to increase our impact in the field.  This means releasing new versions of the Alter Ego, creating viral content, and <span class=""s1"">continuing</span> our mission to help bring clean water to every human beign on earth.</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>The Plan</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">We've already been working with our suppliers for months and we're ready to set off things in motion as soon as we reach our goal. The Eastman Tritan parts and the silicone parts will be made by our Chinese manufacturer and the filtration cartridges will be supplied by our US manufacturer. We expect to be able to deliver most of the rewards within four to five months after our project is funded. Here are our next steps:</p>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li class=""li3"">Start tooling production and update funders</li>
</ul>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li class=""li3"">Validate the tooling with a production sample run and update funders</li>
</ul>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li class=""li3"">Confirm first production run and update funders</li>
</ul>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li class=""li3"">Finalize <span class=""s1"">packaging</span> and update funders</li>
</ul>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li class=""li3"">Obtain supplies &amp; packaging and update funders</li>
</ul>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li class=""li3"">Generate fulfillment tickets &amp; shipping labels and update funders</li>

<h1><strong>Alter Ego étanche votre soif d'eau</strong></h1>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Alter Ego</strong> est un dispositif de filtration et d’hydratation personnel constitué de deux composantes principales: </span><strong>Alter</strong>, la bouteille et <strong>Ego</strong>, le dispositif de filtration sur paille. L'ensemble a été conçu pour le voyageur urbain et l'amateur de randonnées hors pistes autant que pour le travailleur humanitaire pour qui un accès à l'eau potable est une question de survie.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Le duo Alter Ego est le compagnon idéal pour vous permettre de maintenir un niveau d'hydratation acceptable car il se transporte partout et filtre l'eau de n'importe quelle source instantanément, de l'eau chlorée de la ville à l'eau sale d'une rivière dans un pays étranger. Le goût, l'odeur et la disponibilité de l'eau ne seront plus jamais un obstacle à votre santé.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Le duo Alter Ego est également un objet essentiel à avoir sous la main en cas de catastrophe naturelle. Lorsque les services municipaux arrêtent que votre approvisionnement en eau potable devient non-sécuritaire, votre duo Alter Ego vous garantit un approvisionnement personnel fiable jusqu'à ce que la situation revienne à la normale.</p>

<p> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Sa conception robuste et sécuritaire à base de copolymère Eastman Tritan sans BPA font de <strong>Alter</strong></span><strong> </strong>un choix de premier plan en matière d’hydratation personnelle. Sa forme en V et ses trois angles ont été parfaitement étudiés pour assurer une prise confortable et sécuritaire à toutes les tailles de mains. Elle est pourvue d'une base arrondie qui s'adapte à la plupart des supports à gobelets et elle ne roulera jamais très loin de vous! Avec une ouverture à chaque extrémité, <strong>Alter</strong> est facile à laver et son goulot à grande ouverture permet d'insérer des cubes de glace. Elle est le choix parfait pour apprécier une eau fraîche sans arrière goût métallique. La bouteille <strong>Alter</strong> peut être achetée et utilisée avec ou sans le dispositif de filtration <strong>Ego</strong>.</p>

Initialement conçu pour la bouteille <strong>Alter</strong>, il peut également être utilisé séparément car son adapteur en silicone a été dessiné pour s'adapter la majorité des grandes marques de bouteilles à gros goulot disponibles sur le marché.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Pourvue de la technologie de filtration <a href=""http://revolvewater.com/?page_id=5120"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Revolve</a> approuvée EPA, notre cartouche de filtration est conçue pour filtrer les contaminants les plus tenaces jusqu'à 99.9999%. Elle produit une eau pure et exempte de polluants chimiques, organiques ainsi que de virus, bactéries et cistes. La cartouche est disponible en trois modèles différents: Urbain, Hors-piste (99.99%), et Globe Trotter (99.9999%). La capacité de filtration varie selon le modèle: Urbain: jusqu'à 200 gallons (750 litres) Hors-Piste: jusqu'à 200 gallons (750 litres) Globe-Trotter: jusqu'à 75 gallons (285 litres).</p>

<h1>Le concept packaging Alter Ego</h1>
<p class=""template asset"">Conçu par l'agence <a href=""http://www.circodebakuza.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Circo de Bakusa</a>, le concept packaging Alter Ego est une réflexion sur la situation de l'eau sur la planète. La bouteille Alter et le dispositif de filtration Ego sont emballés individuellement mais ils dépendent l'un de l'autre pour accomplir la fonction pour laquelle ils ont été conçus.</p>
<p class=""template asset"">Les visages sur les boites représentent les populations pour qui l'accès à l'eau potable et facile ainsi que les populations pour qui l'accès à l'eau potable constitue un combat quotidien. Douze visages seront imprimés sur les emballages: six visages des population favorisées et six visages des populations défavorisées. Un emballage triangulaire représente le sixième de la population mondiale qui n'a pas accès à l'eau potable et un cercle complet de six boites triangulaires représente la race humaine unie pour combattre la crise mondiale de l'eau.</p>

Alter Ego Phase II: Help us make it available to even more people
The Alter Ego project is moving forward and we are presently fine tuning the design and readying for the launch of the mould production. Thanks to your awesome contributions, the first phase of this campaign has allowed us to raise enough money to pay for the moulds and honor the perks that were bought.
And now we ask for your help to raise a little more money so that we can order more products and get the word out there to make this project a commercial success.  The more capital we raise to maximize distribution channels, the greater the chance of establishing a lasting brand.  Our goal is to provide a steady long term stream of income to our water charities.
This second phase is also a great opportunity to get the Alter Ego duo at very good pre-launch prices.

Satisfy your thirst for water and equity
What if we were to tell you that you can get the most stylish and efficient state of the art personal water filtration duo and give a family of five water for life at the same time?
Well that's exactly what Alter Ego is about: A highly functional piece of design that empowers you to create change in the world by helping reduce the inequity of clean water access.
How: The Alter Ego duo is tied to raising funds for inspiring water charities that are committed to bring fresh and clean water to the millions still in need around the world.

Good water for you AND for your alter ego
The Alter Ego duo is a high end designer product with much more than materialistic value. Drink good water with style for you and your family and make a life saving difference for your alter ego in a developing country!
 The Alter Ego duo

How it works
Each Alter Ego duo is tied to raising funds for inspiring, impactful water charities that are committed to bringing fresh and clean water to the millions still in need around the world.
For each Alter Ego duo you purchase, a water charity will bring fresh and clean water to someone in need. The more you purchase, the more you become part of the change. It's as simple as that!
We are currently finalizing partnerships with charity: water , and ecofiltro:one amongst others.

Ecofiltro: one is a 501(c)(3) public charity who delivers filters to rural communities in a sustained manner that creates clean water for life.
They reach rural communities by partnering with local community leadership, educating them about the importance of clean drinking water. Whether they get water from a natural spring, rain run-off, or contaminated well, the goal is to help villagers understand the health benefits of filtered water. They know the only way to do this sustainably is to organize communities to take control of their own health the same way affluent nations do.
 

Alter Ego and ecofiltro: one
When you buy an Alter Ego duo, funds will be given to ecofiltro:one. These funds will be used to give ecofilters to Guatemalan villagers in need of clean water.  This financial help will allow Guatemalans to implement a controllable, sustainable program to get replacement filters for the rest of their lives. For every 3 Alter Ego duos you purchase, 1 Guatemalan will get fresh, clean water for life. Act now!

We've been dreaming of it...
 

We're the team behind the AQUAOVO experience who brought you the OVOPUR eco-design water filter and from the start, we've been dreaming of a stylish and equitable mass market solution that would be more portable than the OVOPUR.
 
The team: Stéphanie, Noémie, Vince, Isabelle, Fred and Manuel.
 
We listened to what you had to say and we worked very hard to bring you what we've all been waiting for: a portable, personal, intelligent water bottle with an outstanding design and first class water filtration technology!
And since we know that you care so much about the world around you, we designed this new product to help people in developing countries get access to clean water. Alter Ego’s purpose is to help reduce the inequity of clean water access in the world. Right from the start, we want every sale of an Alter Ego Duo to help someone less fortunate to gain access to clean water.

Alter Ego satisfies your thirst for water
Alter Ego is a personal water filtration and hydration duo made of two components: Alter, the bottle and Ego, the water filter assembly. It was designed to accommodate the urban traveller and the outdoor enthusiast on a day expedition, as well as the humanitarian worker in a developing country, for which access to clean water is a matter of survival.
The Alter Ego duo is your perfect hydration companion,reminding you to drink water daily and taking away the excuse of not drinking enough water:  The powerful filtration technology allows for the treatment of any questionable source of fresh water; from a chlorinated water source in the city to a dirty river in a foreign country.
The Alter Ego duo is also a must have in case of natural disaster. When the power goes off and the water supply becomes unsafe, your Alter Ego duo guarantees you a reliable and steady personal water supply. 
 

The Alter Ego prototype with packaging concept.
 
Made of safe and tough, BPA-free, Eastman Tritan copolymer, the Alter bottle is a premium choice in terms of personal hydration. Its seamless V-shaped trigon design allows for a grip that fits all hand sizes.  The unique shape will fit most cup holders and it prevents the bottle from rolling away! Designed to open on both ends, Alter is easy to wash and its wide mouth opening allows the use of ice cubes. It’s the perfect way to enjoy clean and fresh water with no metallic aftertaste. It can be purchased and used with or without the Ego water filter assembly.
Capacity: 700 ml – 24 oz

The Ego water filter assembly combines beautiful design, top-quality components, and state-of-the-art water filtration technology. Primarily designed to perfectly fit the Alter bottle, it can also be used separately, as the silicone spout adapter has been designed to fit most of the wide mouth bottle brands available on the market.
Equipped with EPA-approved filtration technology made in the USA by Revolve, our filter cartridge is designed to filter out contaminants up to six logs (99.9999%) and renders clean water that is free of chemical and organic contaminants, as well as viruses, bacteria and cysts. This means you can instantly drink water worry-free from nearly any fresh water body in the world. The filter cartridge is available in three different models: Tap, Outdoor (99.99%) and Advanced Outdoor (99.9999%). The filtration capacity varies upon the model. Tap: up to 200 gallons (750 liters) Outdoor: up to 200 gallons (750 liters) Advanced: up to 75 gallons (285 liters).
Here's a short video from our friends at Revolve: http://youtu.be/9vkrkX3rnEg
 


The Ego water filter assembly will fit most wide mouthed bottles on the market, including the Alter bottle.

The Alter Ego packaging concept
Initially developed by creative agency Circo De Bakuza, the Alter Ego packaging concept is a reflection of the water situation in the world today. The Alter bottle and the Ego water filter assembly are packaged individually but they depend on each other to achieve their end goal. The faces on the boxes represent both the people in areas of the world who have plenty of access to clean water and the people from areas of the world where having access to clean water is still a daily struggle. They need each other to be whole and functional. There will be 12 sets of faces on the triangular shaped box.  6 haves and 6 have nots. The 6 have nots each represent the one person in six who doesn't have access to clean water. The faces represent the whole human race gathered to solve the world water crisis when assembled in a complete circle of six boxes.

Le fonctionnement
Chaque duo Alter Ego a pour mission d'amasser des fonds pour aider des organismes qui oeuvres sur le terrain afin de donner accès à l'eau potable aux millions de personnes sur la planète qui n'y ont toujours pas accès.
Pour chaque duo Alter Ego que vous achetez, une OBNL oeuvrant pour l'accès à l'eau potable pourra déservir une personne en plus. Plus vous achetez et plus vous prenez part au changement. C'est aussi simple que ça!
Nous travaillons présentement à finaliser des partenariats avec charity: water et ecofiltro:one et nous discutons avec plusieurs autres.
 

Ecofiltro: one est un organisme public à but non lucratif 501(c)(3) qui a pour mission d'implanter des dispositifs de filtration dans les communautés rurales du Guatemala de manière durable afin que les habitants de ces communautés ai accès à l'eau potable à vie.
L'organisme rejoint ces communautés rurales en développant des relations avec les leaders locaux et en leur enseignant l'importance d'un accès à l'eau non contaminée pour la communauté. Qu'ils s'approvisionnent à une source naturelle, à l'eau de pluie ou à même un puits contaminé, l'objectif du projet est d'aider les villageois à bien saisir l'importance des avantages sanitaires que procure la filtration de l'eau. Et la seule manière durable d'effectuer ce travail est par l'organisation des communautés afin qu'ils prennent le contrôle de leur propre santé à la manière des communautés plus développées.
 

Alter Ego et ecofiltro: one
Lorsque vous achetez un duo Alter Ego nous redonnons une partie des bénéfices à ecofiltro: one afin qu'ils puissent donner des écofiltres aux villageois Guatémaltèques en les aidant à s'organiser afin qu'ils puissent s'approvisionner en filtres de rechanges pour le restant de leurs jours. Pour chaque ensemble de 3 duos Alter Ego que vous achetez, 1 Guatémaltèque de plus aura accès à l'eau potable à vie. Agissez maintenant!

Une réunion de production autour du prototype Alter Ego.

 
Alter Ego étanche votre soif d'eau
Alter Ego est un dispositif de filtration et d’hydratation personnel constitué de deux composantes principales: Alter, la bouteille et Ego, le dispositif de filtration sur paille. L'ensemble a été conçu pour le voyageur urbain et l'amateur de randonnées hors pistes autant que pour le travailleur humanitaire pour qui un accès à l'eau potable est une question de survie.
Le duo Alter Ego est le compagnon idéal pour vous permettre de maintenir un niveau d'hydratation acceptable car il se transporte partout et filtre l'eau de n'importe quelle source instantanément, de l'eau chlorée de la ville à l'eau sale d'une rivière dans un pays étranger. Le goût, l'odeur et la disponibilité de l'eau ne seront plus jamais un obstacle à votre santé.
Le duo Alter Ego est également un objet essentiel à avoir sous la main en cas de catastrophe naturelle. Lorsque les services municipaux arrêtent que votre approvisionnement en eau potable devient non-sécuritaire, votre duo Alter Ego vous garantit un approvisionnement personnel fiable jusqu'à ce que la situation revienne à la normale.
 

Le prototype Alter Ego et son concept packaging.
 
Sa conception robuste et sécuritaire à base de copolymère Eastman Tritan sans BPA font de Alter un choix de premier plan en matière d’hydratation personnelle. Sa forme en V et ses trois angles ont été parfaitement étudiés pour assurer une prise confortable et sécuritaire à toutes les tailles de mains. Elle est pourvue d'une base arrondie qui s'adapte à la plupart des supports à gobelets et elle ne roulera jamais très loin de vous! Avec une ouverture à chaque extrémité, Alter est facile à laver et son goulot à grande ouverture permet d'insérer des cubes de glace. Elle est le choix parfait pour apprécier une eau fraîche sans arrière goût métallique. La bouteille Alter peut être achetée et utilisée avec ou sans le dispositif de filtration Ego.
Volume: 700ml - 24 oz
 

La forme unique de la bouteille Alter Ego en vue aérienne.
 
Le dispositif de filtration sur paille Ego combine un magnifique design d'avant-garde, des matériaux de première qualité et une technologie de filtration avancée. Initialement conçu pour la bouteille Alter, il peut également être utilisé séparément car son adapteur en silicone a été dessiné pour s'adapter la majorité des grandes marques de bouteilles à gros goulot disponibles sur le marché.
Pourvue de la technologie de filtration Revolve approuvée EPA, notre cartouche de filtration est conçue pour filtrer les contaminants les plus tenaces jusqu'à 99.9999%. Elle produit une eau pure et exempte de polluants chimiques, organiques ainsi que de virus, bactéries et cistes. La cartouche est disponible en trois modèles différents: Urbain, Hors-piste (99.99%), et Globe Trotter (99.9999%). La capacité de filtration varie selon le modèle: Urbain: jusqu'à 200 gallons (750 litres) Hors-Piste: jusqu'à 200 gallons (750 litres) Globe-Trotter: jusqu'à 75 gallons (285 litres).

Le concept packaging Alter Ego
Conçu par l'agence Circo de Bakusa, le concept packaging Alter Ego est une réflexion sur la situation de l'eau sur la planète. La bouteille Alter et le dispositif de filtration Ego sont emballés individuellement mais ils dépendent l'un de l'autre pour accomplir la fonction pour laquelle ils ont été conçus.
Les visages sur les boites représentent les populations pour qui l'accès à l'eau potable et facile ainsi que les populations pour qui l'accès à l'eau potable constitue un combat quotidien. Douze visages seront imprimés sur les emballages: six visages des population favorisées et six visages des populations défavorisées. Un emballage triangulaire représente le sixième de la population mondiale qui n'a pas accès à l'eau potable et un cercle complet de six boites triangulaires représente la race humaine unie pour combattre la crise mondiale de l'eau.

<h3>On A Mission, Inc. (South Campus)</h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">Almost 3 years ago, On A Mission received a small grant from The Home Depot Foundation providing us with the funds needed to fix up an abandoned building in South Central, L.A. This building had not been used in almost 20 years, but we saw both a wealth of potential and possibilities.  With the help of our friends, supporters, community, and corporations, we were able to transform this once neighborhood ""eye sore"", into a youth center complete with after school programs and activities.  <em>(To View 2010 Renovation Project, click <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs7SosBrStE&amp;feature=share&amp;list=UUpZWu_Z4s0KBSEHvoldavUQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""The Home Depot Foundation Renovation Project"">HERE</a>)</em></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">On A Mission has now come to a time where we greatly need to expand the size of our location, as just last year we served over 350 kids with all of our programs and services combined.  The funds raised from this campaign will go directly towards the completion of the south campus renovations. </span></p>
<h3>On A Mission, Inc. Boys Home (North Campus)</h3>
<p>In California alone, there are over 60,000 kids living in the foster care system.  Many of these kids just need someone to believe in them, and provide them with a chance to succeed.  As On A Mission, Inc. looks to expand our programs and services in 2013, we will soon open our 8 bed boys home.  This home will provide housing to boys currently living in the foster care system, and will give them a safe place to live while they attend school, and complete their education.  </p>
<p>On A Mission, Inc's goal is to raise $30,000 during the course of the indiegogo campaign.  All of which will be used to fund our new group home and the expansion of our current after school program set to open later this year. </p>

<p>On A Mission, Inc.</p></div>","Who Is On A Mission, Inc.? 

On A Mission is an after school programs in South L.A. providing kids with a safe place to go during those critical after school hours when youth violence generally increases. Our programs specifically address the needs of both male & female youth ages 12-17, many of whom come from single parent families.
In addition, we teach kids everything from how to dress for success, resume building, respect, responsibility, gang and drug prevention and intervention, how to open and manage a bank account, mock job interviews, and much more. Our goal is to give our kids the positive support needed to make the right decisions when peer pressure situations arise. Our programs also give kids the chance to succeed while having a huge positive impact on both them and the community.

What Your Donation Funds & What You Get


 
On A Mission, Inc. (South Campus)
Almost 3 years ago, On A Mission received a small grant from The Home Depot Foundation providing us with the funds needed to fix up an abandoned building in South Central, L.A. This building had not been used in almost 20 years, but we saw both a wealth of potential and possibilities.  With the help of our friends, supporters, community, and corporations, we were able to transform this once neighborhood ""eye sore"", into a youth center complete with after school programs and activities.  (To View 2010 Renovation Project, click HERE)
On A Mission has now come to a time where we greatly need to expand the size of our location, as just last year we served over 350 kids with all of our programs and services combined.  The funds raised from this campaign will go directly towards the completion of the south campus renovations. 
On A Mission, Inc. Boys Home (North Campus)
In California alone, there are over 60,000 kids living in the foster care system.  Many of these kids just need someone to believe in them, and provide them with a chance to succeed.  As On A Mission, Inc. looks to expand our programs and services in 2013, we will soon open our 8 bed boys home.  This home will provide housing to boys currently living in the foster care system, and will give them a safe place to live while they attend school, and complete their education.  
On A Mission, Inc's goal is to raise $30,000 during the course of the indiegogo campaign.  All of which will be used to fund our new group home and the expansion of our current after school program set to open later this year. 
If you should have any questions,or concerns regarding this campaign, please feel free to contact us at (323) 298-4779 or e-mail us at: info@joinoam.org

Who We Are


SOS is a nonprofit production studio based in Montreal, Quebec, which will produce original science fiction content for the web and beyond.
SOS is a response to a distress signal by fans of science fiction around the cosmos to revive the genre, especially the space opera, which has been forgotten over the years.
SOS aspires to become THE virtual meeting place for lovers of science fiction, and fans are being invited to participate in the development of projects, to freely discuss their passion in an environment respectful of its fans, and of course to watch our productions.
By adopting a crowdfunding mode of financing, and a transparent business model, SOS will go where few production companies have gone before. In this regard, SOS is inspired by New York`s Metropolitan Opera, as the MET Members (fans and opera lovers), and  SOS donors (fans and enthusiasts of traditional sci-fi shows), know that their investment will be used for production, and profits will be reinvested in the development and production of new projects.
SOS can also count on an outstanding team of international talent (writers, actors, directors, make up artists, production designers, model makers, VFX artists) who have worked on such cult series and movies as Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, Space: 1999, Stargate, X-files, Dune, Alien, Outland, Tron and many more...Join our rescue team!
help us bring quality science fiction back to television!
Learn more about the Space Opera Society team and how you can join them HERELets make the future of television together!
What We Need and What You Get
We are aiming to raise $202,099 as initial start-up funds.
We have already begun pre-production design work, concept development, and script writing and these funds will enable us to do so much more. As a non-profit organization we are obligated to be transparent in our accounting to all our contributors on an annual basis so you will know EXACTLY where your hard earned money has gone.

<p>In the past decade, over 100,000 Americans have lost their source of employment in the home furnishings industry. This has left many a household and entire community devastated. The cause? Mostly, the<em> outsourcing of labor</em>. </p>
<p>In an effort to create employment in the USA, <em>and</em> keep the skills associated with this industry alive on our own shores,<strong> VALOR American Home</strong> is being created. It will be a new lifestyle brand of home furnishings in which every possible part of the product will be made, right here, in the USA. It will be of the finest quality---all of sustainable manufacture. Jobs-- from the farmers growing cotton and herding sheep-to the artisans making the product itself-to those involved in the packaging and shipping will be created and supported by this brand.</p>
<p>In addition, once this brand is launched, each purchase will result in the contribution to an American charity that will be selected by <em>you</em>, the supporters and consumers of this product.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To launch a brand of this magnitude, it is necessary to have a substantial marketing plan and customer-friendly website. In addition, the cost of product research and development, warehousing, and customer service is also an integral part of the funding needed. To this accord, we will need to raise a minimum of $250,000. This will allow us to set into motion the beginnings of this very important brand.</p>
<p><strong>VALOR American Home</strong> will be built one room at a time. This is the most economical manner to insure the brand will survive. Therefore, the premiere offering will be all furnishings associated with a living room or den. This will be followed by the bedroom, and lastly, the dining room. Eventually, furnishings for the entire home, all made in the USA, will be offered. </p>
<p>With over 83% of this goal going to perk product manufacture, packaging, shipping, credit card and administrative fees, it is vital that this entire goal be met. However, if this total amount is not achieved, the collected funds will be utilized to offset the expense of current prototypes and research thus completed. </p>
<p>____________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Your support is extremely appreciated and vital for<strong> VALOR American Home</strong> to become a reality. We thank you, in advance, for considering this project. A sampling of products exemplary of this brand are being offered for the consideration of your support. They are totally made in USA. </p>
<p>Packaging and shipping fees within the continental 48 United States are included in the listed perk tiers. Please contact us if you have a need to have the items shipped outside said area. We will be delighted to assist.</p>

<p><b>History
//</b> The
future location of All Together Skatepark, LLC. (ATS) is in Fremont in what
used to be Inner Space—the last indoor skatepark in Seattle. Inner Space,
founded in 2003, was once a popular and beloved gathering place for the Seattle
skateboard scene. Unfortunately, Inner Space was shut down in February of 2012
due to its inability to bring in enough revenue to keep it open. Many have been
hoping and speculating about the opening of this space for Seattle
skateboarders, and the time has finally come! </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>The
Project //</b> Skateboarders need an indoor park to call home in Seattle
because let’s be honest—it rains a lot here. We are creating a fun, friendly
and positive skateboarding experience for all ages with a focus on creating
strong connections with youth. Together with our community and our industry we
are building the only indoor skate park in Seattle. The perfect
balance lies at the intersection of building community, creating a positive place
for skateboarders of all ages, and driving sales of companies that get behind
the park both near and long term.</p>
<p>By helping launch ATS, we have an opportunity to
create a movement setting an entirely new bar in the industry. </p>
<p><b><span>The Goals //</span></b><span> Fundamentally the goal of this Indiegogo campaign is to open a
positive and engaging indoor skatepark that will speak to the spectrum of those
in and outside the Seattle skateboard community.  ATS is planned to launch after a

Our Biggest Season Yet
2015 has been a year of growth for the market. 



We transitioned from the Columbia Heights Community Marketplace to Community Foodworks, and now operate a network of farmers markets across the DC area

We added new vendors to the market: fresh cut flowers, local root beer, kombucha, and smoothies; locally mixed spices; handmade soaps and personal care products, and more!  
We are also piloting new programs for families who need help accessing fresh, healthy food.  

We've rallied interested from all corners of the neighborhood: more people than ever are enjoying healthy, local fruits & veggies from the Columbia Heights Farmers Market.  We need to raise $7,500 to sustain the program over the rest of the season. That will allow us to serve up to 400 more families over the next three months.

</div></div>","What We Need & What You Get

 We need $50,000 to start the development of our community center. The community center will be the hub of all activities that IAMBK will provide.



  The Impact We believe that Self Improvement is the bases of community development.  The mission of IAMBK is to develop and operate programs that substantially improve the quality of life for the residents of the City of San Diego regardless of creed, class or color. To that end, our programs include educational and supportive services such as student enrichment, computer lab, entrepreneurship training, mentoring, parenting classes, senior services, food and nutrition and educational housing opportunities. This agency operates several community based programs, including MEN (Men Engaging Neighborhoods), Silence The Violence Open Mic’s and Get Up and Go For Success. 

Mentoring
I Am My Brother’s Keeper has partnered with local elementary schools to offer school-based and community mentoring to children affected by incarceration and children with failing grades. Community members and students are reunited, screened, trained and matched with a youth for a one year duration.
Tutoring

Partnering with local college students we offer tutoring services to students at no cost. In addition, our center offers SAT and ACT preparation for high school students to prepare them for post-secondary education.
Senior Services

Our center offers a wide array of seniors services that include: internet basics, financial literacy, assisted living, wills and trusts, and independent living.

<h3>Emmy's Heart</h3>
</div>
<div>Joy can be difficult to find in the halls of a pediatric hospital.  Children are scared, parents are worried.  Until the magical clothes rack rolls in.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I know what it's like to be a parent, watching her child fight for his life.  I also know what it's like to be a daughter, watching her mother fight a valiant, yet losing battle with cancer.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My mother was a ten year melanoma survivor when we learned in October 2010 that the beast had returned.  One month later, I learned that my then-seven year old son had leukemia.  Their battles were brutal, and unfortunately, in April 2011, my mother entered hospice.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>At the same time my mother was dying, my son, Josh, was receiving high dose methotrexate during a week-long stay in the hospital.  To say that I was despondent would be an understatement.  To ease my grief, I decided to learn how to make a tutu for my niece, with the hope that it would brighten both of our days.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I made that tutu on April 10, 2011, the day my mother passed away.  It was beautiful, it was fluffy, it lifted my heavy heart.  As I looked at that piece of magic, I realized that I knew many girls who would benefit from a tutu: the girls on the hematology/oncology floor at Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital.  I took a picture, and posted it, along with my plan, on my facebook page.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>What happened next was incredible: my friends wanted to help too!  Everyone wanted to lift the hearts of sick kids by giving them tutus and capes.  Now, I host tutu parties, where volunteers create magic in the form of tutus, crowns, capes and masks.  We then load them into my car and distribute them to kids in hospitals throughout South Florida.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Josh now receives chemo at the hospital once a month.  On those days, I can be found wheeling my clothes rack, laden with tutus and capes, to rooms around Joe D's.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It's joy.  Pure and simple.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>Our tutus cost $8 on average, and capes run about $4.  Some months, we distribute to hundreds of children, so the costs add up quickly!  We have a dedicated donor to pay for mundane expenses like web hosting and business cards, so every penny received goes straight towards purchasing the materials for our kids!  (Really...our volunteers spend hours working away, and only receive brownies and a beverage or two in exchange.)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We use 6 inch rolls of tulle and poly/cotton blend broadcloth for our capes.  If you sew and have scraps, we might just be able to transform them into headbands for a little girl whose hair is finally growing in.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>What will you get?  How about a warm and fuzzy feeling.  Really.  Imagine the smiles you will give.  It's beautiful.  Not only that, but you'll get a tax deduction too!  Emmy's Heart is a 501(c)(3) tax exempt charity, recognized by the IRS.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
By donating to us, you will help sick kids be regular kids for a while.  You will remind little girls who are dealing with the side effects of chemotherapies that they are beautiful.  You will allow a sick boy to put on his cape and remember that he is stronger than anyone could imagine.  You will send gifts home to siblings, who are affected in ways you cannot imagine.  You will help parents enjoy their children, as they giggle and laugh, spin and fly.  You will spread joy.</div>

People are afraid to go to hospitals for treatment and risk catching Ebola, and healthcare workers are so distracted by the Ebola crisis that it takes much longer to get treatment for other diseases. Having had one of these diseases myself, I can speak to the extreme discomfort they cause when unmedicated. Unfortunately, I cannot send antibiotics or anything prescribed that would cure any of these diseases, but I can send over the counter medications to help make things more bearable during the wait for treatment.

</div><h3>In a nutshell...</h3><div>
</div><p>We're raising money to heal an entire group of people through hypnosis in one night FREE OF CHARGE at an evening 2-hour seminar in Southern California!</p><h2>""A Night of Healing""</h2><div> </div><p>My name is Jonathan Hyde and I'm a Certified Hypnotherapist practicing since April of 2010. I became a hypnotherapist because it's my goal in life to heal people of the emotional problems they carry with them. I don't feel I'm reaching enough people through the 1 on 1 sessions I have, so it is my wish and dream to help to heal an entire group of people through a 2 hour seminar that outlines hypnosis and to induce hypnosis to the entire audience and guide them through releasing their emotional problems and baggage. I want to donate my services as a hypnotherapist and help to heal those who can't afford a 1 on 1 hypnotherapy session by doing this for FREE. All who attend this ""Night of Healing"" will be admitted FREE OF CHARGE! </p><div>
</div><p>Here's the details of ""A Night of Healing""</p><div>
</div><p>In September this year, I will hold a 2-hour hypnosis seminar at a local hotel in Torrance, California for SoCal residents. This seminar will be completely FREE OF CHARGE because I want to help as many people as I possibly can. Here's what'll happen at the seminar...</p><ul>
<li>I'll Introduce myself and explain my credentials and background</li>
<li>Explain what hypnosis is and how it works</li>
<li>Give examples of some things hypnosis can help with and how</li>
<li>Provide a visual, drawn out explanation of how the sub-conscious and conscious minds work (and sometimes how they don't work)</li>
<li>(Short Break)</li>
<li>Test the audiences suggestibility (how one takes in information either <em><em>directly</em> or indirectly)</em>
</li>
<li>Induce the audience into a hypnotic state and deepen their state through a series of different techniques</li>
<li>Use the power of suggestions and imagination to release their emotional burden</li>
<li>Count up to 5 to return to a fully awake and alert state</li>
<li>Explain what I just did</li>
<li>Answer final questions and end the seminar</li>
</ul><p>So I need to raise enough money to finance this event and to reach out to as many potential attendees as possible. That's my goal!</p><div>

</div></div>","In a nutshell...
We're raising money to heal an entire group of people through hypnosis in one night FREE OF CHARGE at an evening 2-hour seminar in Southern California!""A Night of Healing"" My name is Jonathan Hyde and I'm a Certified Hypnotherapist practicing since April of 2010. I became a hypnotherapist because it's my goal in life to heal people of the emotional problems they carry with them. I don't feel I'm reaching enough people through the 1 on 1 sessions I have, so it is my wish and dream to help to heal an entire group of people through a 2 hour seminar that outlines hypnosis and to induce hypnosis to the entire audience and guide them through releasing their emotional problems and baggage. I want to donate my services as a hypnotherapist and help to heal those who can't afford a 1 on 1 hypnotherapy session by doing this for FREE. All who attend this ""Night of Healing"" will be admitted FREE OF CHARGE! 
Here's the details of ""A Night of Healing""
In September this year, I will hold a 2-hour hypnosis seminar at a local hotel in Torrance, California for SoCal residents. This seminar will be completely FREE OF CHARGE because I want to help as many people as I possibly can. Here's what'll happen at the seminar...
I'll Introduce myself and explain my credentials and background
Explain what hypnosis is and how it works
Give examples of some things hypnosis can help with and how
Provide a visual, drawn out explanation of how the sub-conscious and conscious minds work (and sometimes how they don't work)
(Short Break)
Test the audiences suggestibility (how one takes in information either directly or indirectly)

Induce the audience into a hypnotic state and deepen their state through a series of different techniques
Use the power of suggestions and imagination to release their emotional burden
Count up to 5 to return to a fully awake and alert state
Explain what I just did
Answer final questions and end the seminar
So I need to raise enough money to finance this event and to reach out to as many potential attendees as possible. That's my goal!
What will my donation do? 
Your Contribution will pay for a banquet room at a hotel in Torrance, California and the advertising costs to promote ""A Night of Healing"". I don't want to do this only one time, I want to make this a reoccurring thing, so any donations that go over the goal will be contributed to future seminars!
What We Need & What You Get We need a minimum of $1,500. Half of that will go to covering the cost of renting a banquet room large enough to hold about 150 people for 2 hours. The other half will go toward advertising in local newspapers, mailers and flyers. Anything left over will go toward the next event! The benefit of this campaign is that contributors will see pictures of the seminar after it's taken place and top contributors will actually get to attend the event in person! Anyone who contributes, you will receive whatever perk at your level of contribution AND all perks below!
  The Impact This simple campaign is EASY to see where your money will go. There is NO RISK and you will actually see where your money goes AND there's no waiting around to see the results, because as soon as the funds are collected, Work will immediately go into reserving a banquet room and advertising the seminar.
  
Other Ways You Can Help

</ul></div>","About My FellowshipIn February, I will depart for Zambia and Zimbabwe on a four-month assignment as a Kiva Fellow.  In this volunteer role, I will work with Kiva's Field Partners Zoona and the Campaign for Female Education (Camfed).  Both entities are part of Kiva's worldwide efforts to alleviate poverty through micro loans to build small businesses and lift up entire communities.My first month of service will take place in Zambia, working with Zoona.  Zoona provides important resources and tools to small business owners that help keep transactions secure while providing customers with better service.  These tools help small businesses grow, and as they do, families become more financially stable.  My field work will focus on visiting with entrepreneurs who are benefitting from Kiva micro loans and Zoona's platforms, and ensuring that these resources and tools are being leveraged for maximum benefit.For the remaining three months of my Kiva Fellowship, I'll be working in Zimbabwe with Camfed.  Camfed is dedicated to ensuring an education for girls' throughout rural Zimbabwe.  Their approach includes direct aid in the form of scholarships for girls' complete secondary education, covering school fees, uniforms, books, pencils and bags.  Additionally, Camfed provides loans in these same rural areas to support women-owned small businesses.  These two efforts then dovetail.  Women receiving interest-free loans to help grow their business commit to investing their own social capital by serving as etching assistance in local schools.  So not only does Camfed assist families with meeting the educational costs of their children, but they also engage them with dignity and respect - allowing them to invest what they can in making the education of their children possible.  My work will focus on helping Camfed maximize its partnership with Kiva, and will include work in the field visiting schools and meeting the families that are benefitting from Camfed's efforts.For more than 20 years, my career and my travels have been dedicated to helping those in need around the world.  It's an honor to be chosen as a Kiva Fellow, allowing me to extend my professional work and personal passions for the benefit of impoverished families in southern Africa.By contributing to my campaign, you'll be taking part in the great things we can only accomplish together.  I've been blessed with many things, but it's only been through the sharing of those blessings that I've found true meaning and richness in my life.  I hope you'll join me in this special effort, and allow me to be your heart's boots on the ground doing important work for families in Zambia and Zimbabwe.How You Can Be A PartBecause the nature of the work is so meaningful, it is a great honor and distinction to be named a Kiva Fellow.  In addition to committing my time and expertise, I must also fund all expenses associated with my assignment.  My budget for my four-month deployment is as follows:
Airfare ($0 - thanks to frequent flier miles!)
Housing ($2,000)
Food ($800)
Intra- and Inter-country transportation ($400)
Local cell phone ($200)
Travel insurance ($500)
Visas ($600)
Emergency Fund ($500)
TOTAL: $5,000

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>Hello amazing people!!  I am a young entrepreneur that has had my career taken away from me with ten days notice because an executive in the company I was a franchisee for told a lie that cost me everything.  I believe that this world is built on good, kind people, and I'm hoping and praying that you will help me through the rebuilding process.</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Help I Need</h3> <p>If any of you personally know me, you know that I LOVED my life.  I loved my career.  I loved being able to help people.  I loved that I got to spend quality time with my friends and family.  I loved that I had the freedoms to take care of myself, my business, people I loved, charities I felt strongly about, and people I came across that were in need.  What this company did to me was unspeakable.  My attorneys originally thought that, since this executive had admitted his fault, I would be able to gain some sort of compensation for the losses they left me with.  Not only did they tarnish my name and my reputation in the industry, but they caused the 600+ clients I had gained to lose faith in myself and my team.  They denied me earned bonuses that would've paid off my year-one debt entirely.  They left me with crippling debt and no way to pay it off.  On top of that, they took my business name.  This meant that, assuming I could find a company that would give me a chance, I would have to start all over again from scratch.  Trying to find funding for start-up businesses is impossible.  This is what I am hoping and praying for help with:</p> <ul>
<li>A business line of credit that I am currently three months behind on.  This line of credit was extended to me by my old company.  I had it in my business plan that it would be paid off in full with the bonuses I'd already earned from them, that were supposed to be paid to me in the 2014 year.  My payment is over $1000/mo and the balance is just over $48,000.</li> <li>Business credit card debt totaling $52,000.00.  About $24,000 of this was left to me from my old company.  The extra has been added on as I have been relying on available credit to cover bills since the business was forced to close.</li>
</ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Your contribution to my campaign will </p> <ul>
<li>Support a local small business that is fighting to stay solvent after a drastic blow from a giant corporation.<br/>
</li> <li>Allow me to build my business and get back to being able to help people in my community.<br/>
</li> <li>Not to sound cheesy or corny, but you will be saving my life - my sanity, my current relationships (both personal and professional), my credit, my name and my word.  You'd be giving me back the future that was taken from me and re-illuminating the stars in my sky.<br/>
</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Plan<br/>
</h3> <p> I've spend a lot of time after hours working on a solid plan to help bring my business to the surface.  With your help, I can hire a second employee and put some money back into marketing.  With hard work and a decent marketing budget, I can bring the business to where it needs to be within three months.</p>
<p>I have a great deal of experience in this industry.  I spent two and a half years working with an agent to build a business from scratch, then another two and a half years working with a different agent to turn his upside-down agency right-side-up.  Following that, I opened my own agency, starting with absolutely zero customers, and turned it into a business that grossed a  quarter of a million dollars within twelve months time.  Granted it takes time, money, and good employees to do that, but I firmly believe that, with your help, I can do it all over again this year.  <br/></p>
<p>I feel that I've built a name for myself in my community.  My clients are constantly referring their friends and family to me for help, and I have build great relationships with business partners in the community that provide a variety of related services. All I need is just a bit of help lifting the rock off my chest so that I can breathe again.<br/></p> <ul></ul>

The Help I Need If any of you personally know me, you know that I LOVED my life.  I loved my career.  I loved being able to help people.  I loved that I got to spend quality time with my friends and family.  I loved that I had the freedoms to take care of myself, my business, people I loved, charities I felt strongly about, and people I came across that were in need.  What this company did to me was unspeakable.  My attorneys originally thought that, since this executive had admitted his fault, I would be able to gain some sort of compensation for the losses they left me with.  Not only did they tarnish my name and my reputation in the industry, but they caused the 600+ clients I had gained to lose faith in myself and my team.  They denied me earned bonuses that would've paid off my year-one debt entirely.  They left me with crippling debt and no way to pay it off.  On top of that, they took my business name.  This meant that, assuming I could find a company that would give me a chance, I would have to start all over again from scratch.  Trying to find funding for start-up businesses is impossible.  This is what I am hoping and praying for help with: 
A business line of credit that I am currently three months behind on.  This line of credit was extended to me by my old company.  I had it in my business plan that it would be paid off in full with the bonuses I'd already earned from them, that were supposed to be paid to me in the 2014 year.  My payment is over $1000/mo and the balance is just over $48,000. Business credit card debt totaling $52,000.00.  About $24,000 of this was left to me from my old company.  The extra has been added on as I have been relying on available credit to cover bills since the business was forced to close.

  The Impact Your contribution to my campaign will  
Support a local small business that is fighting to stay solvent after a drastic blow from a giant corporation.
 Allow me to build my business and get back to being able to help people in my community.
 Not to sound cheesy or corny, but you will be saving my life - my sanity, my current relationships (both personal and professional), my credit, my name and my word.  You'd be giving me back the future that was taken from me and re-illuminating the stars in my sky.
 
  The Plan
  I've spend a lot of time after hours working on a solid plan to help bring my business to the surface.  With your help, I can hire a second employee and put some money back into marketing.  With hard work and a decent marketing budget, I can bring the business to where it needs to be within three months.
I have a great deal of experience in this industry.  I spent two and a half years working with an agent to build a business from scratch, then another two and a half years working with a different agent to turn his upside-down agency right-side-up.  Following that, I opened my own agency, starting with absolutely zero customers, and turned it into a business that grossed a  quarter of a million dollars within twelve months time.  Granted it takes time, money, and good employees to do that, but I firmly believe that, with your help, I can do it all over again this year.  
I feel that I've built a name for myself in my community.  My clients are constantly referring their friends and family to me for help, and I have build great relationships with business partners in the community that provide a variety of related services. All I need is just a bit of help lifting the rock off my chest so that I can breathe again. 
  Other Ways You Can Help If you do not have the ability to donate personally, please pass my story along to anyone and everyone you know.  The more people this reaches, the more of a chance I will have at reaching my goal.  You never know who might be able to help, whether by donating, or simply sharing this with their circle of influence.Besides email, texting, and telling people about me, social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook are great ways to share this story.  You can also utilize some of the amazing sharing tools that IndieGoGo has set up for people like me.I want to thank you so very much for taking the time to read this and share it.  I want to thank you for your donations...for any help you can give.  I make a promise to each and every one of you that I will either pay this back, or pay it forward.Thank you!Erin",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We believe that this area could and should have a location that is welcoming, gives fantastic customer service,

<p>Your contribution to our campaign will help us to allow
such a place to take root and flourish. This coffeehouse will be more than
just a business. It will be a meeting place. A community hub. A launch pad for
new vocalists and songwriters. A warm and friendly place for reading, studying,
and socializing. </p><p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We have a space and equipment all set up, but there are some
expenses that we are looking for help with.</p>
<p>$7,000 – Two months rent.  This gives us a little more breathing room
with getting everything up and running.</p>
<p>$3,000 – Equipment fees. 
The space we are moving into already has all of the equipment we need –
coffee roaster, coffee brewing stations, ovens, refrigerators, etc.  This is obviously very beneficial to us, as
we won’t have to buy the equipment, or wait until we have the equipment lined
up to start roasting coffee, and cooking delicious meals.  We are doing a rent to own agreement, and
this $3,000 will take a big bite out of those charges.</p>
<p>$6,930 – Payroll.  In
order to roast and brew coffee, plus cook and bake our little hearts out for
your delight, we need a few people working for us.  This will be so that while we are getting
established, we can hire and properly train our staff.</p>
<p>$1,442 – Utility deposits. 
Obviously in order to brew the most amazing cup of joe that you have ever tasted, we need water.  And
electricity.  And a phone so you can call
us and tell us how miraculous our coffee is. 
So this bit will help get the shop open, brewing and cooking, and ready
for you to come in.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Getting this café open
would obviously be a wonderful thing for us. 
Here’s how it helps you:</p>
<p>You deserve good
coffee.  Not just good coffee, but great
coffee.  Freshly roasted coffee is more than just a 'pick me up'. It's a GREAT tasting cup of 'get up and go'. Once more people start drinking
the best coffee that they've ever had, their moods will improve, making
them and the people around them happier. 
That will spur feelings like ‘Alright, let’s get this done!’ and ‘Let’s
do this!’. Freshly roasted, freshly brewed coffee is
really the gift that keeps on giving.</p>
<p>We will be hoping to
hire 8-12 staff members.  While this
doesn't seem like a lot, it’s 8-12 people who will have a job,
so that will be helping them and their families, which strengthens the community overall.</p>
<p>We will provide a
comfortable, upbeat place for community groups to meet.  The space that we are moving into has not
only tables and chairs, but couches and  comfy chairs making it perfect for meetings and gatherings.</p>
<p>We are also big
supporters of the arts, and are looking forward to bringing lots of local
talent into our place.  This will be a
great way for customers to find new favorite bands, singers, poets or comedians, and
really support the local arts community.</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>We know that most new
restaurants fail in the first year.  But…
that won’t happen to us.  We will make
the best coffee you've ever had, and our food will make you want to come back
for more.  When you add that to our
community ties, plus our sheer stubbornness, we don't see failure as an option.  We fully plan on becoming known
for our food, drinks, and atmosphere, and intend to become a community staple.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Demand better
coffee.  Share this campaign with your family,
share it with your friends.  Help make
this dream of providing Voorhees with the café it deserves a reality.</p>

Jenny's Story
In Jenny's own words she is, ""a sister, daughter, aunt, friend, wife, and most recently a mother.  Since February 20th, none of those titles has changed, but an
unfortunate medical diagnosis has been added – Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, breast
cancer.""  
Jenny is currently recovering from a double mastectomy and just found out that she will need to start chemotherapy at the end of May and radiation after that.    She is looking at another 6-7 months of treatment, so there is a long road ahead of her. This is a difficult situation both physically and emotionally, but it is especially tough when you are a stay-at-home parent to a very active (and adorable) one-year old boy.  Jenny's biggest concern is that her son, Shepherd, is happy and well taken-care of while she goes through this.

About Mommies In Need

Mommies In Need is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that provides in-home childcare to stay-at-home parents going through a health crisis.  We not only fund nannies for sick moms, but also provide them with someone who is vetted, background checked, CPR certified, and experienced in dealing with situations when the parent is suddenly ill.  
We began in October of 2014 with a very successful Indiegogo campaign to help one mom with colon cancer and are proud to say that through all of the generous donations we have recieved, we were able to see that family through the mom's entire chemo treatment- that's nearly six months of full-time nanny care!  We recently helped our second mom during radiation treatment and are currently supporting Jenny's family.

How You Can Help

Sending top quality nannies to these families is expensive, and we need money to be able to guarantee our help to Jenny and to keep growing so that we can take on even more families like hers.  
Let's help take some of the pressure off of these moms so that they can focus on getting better quickly and getting back to their full time jobs of raising little human beings the best they can!


Please, please consider donating as much as you can afford. And if you can't donate then share this link on all of your social media so you can help us find someone who can! Let's band together as a community and support the women who are dedicating their lives to a very important job, a job that has countless benefits- but unfortunately, none of those benefits are disability insurance!

MEET DEANNA:
Although
Deanna, was raised in fine dining restaurants, she seemed to have been
born with a green spoon in her mouth and an intuition about food and its
relationship to health. 
 In 1989
after she welcomed her daughter Alicia into the world, her journey became a
mission to feed her children organic, healthy food. In trying to
accomplish this mission, Deanna quickly discovered eating organic was very
expensive not to mention inconvenient for a busy mom (or anyone for that
matter).
Ahead of her
time, Deanna understood the Health Benefits of eating a plant-based diet. She
became a self-taught Pure Food Chef and a pioneer of plant-based super food
nutrition, self-educating herself on how to replace flavors and textures used
to prepare rich gourmet food with delicious healthy alternatives.  She opened a 200 seat Italian
restaurant in a 4 star hotel in a metropolitan tourist area. She created
an Organic, mouth-watering vegan, and gluten free menu, including a quality
vegan dessert selection that even non-vegans couldn’t get enough of.
Among
Deanna’s many professional accomplishments, she was chosen to be the private
chef for a well-known actor. Guests of her restaurant included the Princess of
Monaco, the US Attorney Surgeon General and an award winning colon cancer
research scientist, as well as many prominent guests from around the world.
Deanna's signature healthy smoothie ""The Green Goddess"" landed her a guest
appearance on a local TV show as well as radio interviews and several speaking
engagements for Health related conventions.
While she
loved catering and creating mouthwatering organic healthy plant based food, she
found herself limited in her ability to reach a larger population.
 
Meet Daryl:Daryl is no stranger to the Internet. As the former CEO/President of Prospect Planet Inc. The company launched at the time one of the first web based Customer Relationship Management Systems.  He led the company to nearly 13 million dollars in sales while attracting tens of thousands of customers. It was introduced during a time when there was a great need in the market. He continues to provide lead generation sales systems for companies in the multi billion dollar Direct Selling Industry.       Daryl believes the void that Deanna's Organic Kitchen will provide in the market along with the timing for delicious Organic Meals that are convenient and affordable is much greater at this time than it ever will be. He is excited about the company becoming an industry trend setter. 
 
While his
professional credentials may be impressive, what is really amazing about
Daryl’s story is the part about his incredible life transformation that not
only changed his life, but impacted the lives of his entire family.  When Daryl made the decision to take
control of his health and change the way he lived and ate.  He
devoured everything in the way of information that he could learn about a plant-based
lifestyle.  Because of the dramatic
positive changes evident in his life, his family and friends are following his lead and
are now on their own path to well being. 

 
 The Impact
Think
about the global implications of what we are proposing… We believe that our
positive impact on the health of peoples lives and our planet is
amazing. We purchase fresh produce in bulk from local organic farmers,
grow our own herbs. We use recyclable packaging. Our meals are prepared fresh
in oven ready, Eco friendly containers. 
We drastically reduce carbon footprint. Compare that to what is
used in packaging alone from the average person’s 7-Day meal plan.  Furthering the sustainability of our kitchen,
we grow our own herbs and sprouts while germinating our grains and
seeds. We use Tower Gardens to save space and energy as well as recycling
cooking water for gardening use and we practice composting.
Each meal is
prepared with Organic ingredients and made with pure love, while never
compromising flavor, balance and your health. Everything is prepared fresh
with your choices from a 100% Organic Vegan and Vegetarian Menu. In
this fast paced world being able to eat healthy organic food shouldn’t have to
be compromised.
Our long
term goals are to have a sustainable teaching Kitchen with an organic garden to
educate children on Organic Farming and culinary skills as well as inviting
students and retired persons as interns. 
Our model encompasses the creation of new jobs and the education of a
whole new era of Pure Food Chefs.
 
OUR ADVISORY BOARD:
Deanna’s
Organic Kitchen is excited to join forces with a team of professionals we will
call our “Wellness Advisory Team” including a Lifestyle Coach and Naturopathic
Doctor who will be there to contribute their wisdom and valuable feedback along
this journey.

<p>My name is Sarah Mayles. On April 13th 2014 I'll be running the London Marathon.

<h1>How does it work?</h1>
<p>Felfil Evo is a small machine that takes inspiration, for its functioning, from the industrial extruders. It can extrude any thermoplastic polymer whose melting temperature does not exceed 300°C, but is tested for PLA and ABS. The material, like pellets or granules, is poured into a hopper from which the screw, specifically realized, fishes. The plastic, now dissolved by the high temperature, (generated from three heaters), comes out passing through a brass nozzle carefully dimensioned.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450705267/vn5xt6wiidm3ougsyghm.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The lowering of the temperature, in the final stretch extrusion, allows greater consistency in obtaining the filament which, according to the nozzle, can be chosen among 1,75mm, 2,85mm or 3mm diameter.</p>
<p>Felfil Evo is designed in order to ensure an high accessibility to all its components and an easy maintenance and implementability.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450705360/jvslcu6qtc8gdmuqi0r4.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p> The temperature control is obtained through a PID system, Arduino based, freely controllable and customizable by the user..<br/>Using the easy menu you will be able to choose a preset or fine tuning your preferences.</div><div> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450705448/tyuihykemwnctx9tpyap.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>How can Felfil Evo be so small and cheap?</p>
<p>Every design choice has been taken in order to reduce the final cost and to increase easy-to-use features, without compromising filament quality.</p>
<p>In fact, Felfil Evo uses a complex brass nozzle, that is able to progressively cool down the filament in a passive way. So the filament gets out from the nozzle with the correct diameter and a relatively cool temperature, so no more deformations would occur.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>No Tequila, No Life. </i><i>Know Tequila, Know Life. </i></p>
<p>Our names are Angel
Gallegos, Peter Trevino and Sylvester Palacios, and we have a dream to launch
our own tequila in the next year. Is starting a tequila company a new thing? Of
course not. However, we're not celebrities or high income individuals starting
a tequila company just for kicks. We're three smart, entrepreneurial Hispanics
that love our background, heritage, and especially tequila, and want to bring
our tequila to the U.S. to share with our friends and family and eventually
grow it into something special.  </p>
<p>We have a brand that
is snowballing on social media, merchandise that is turning heads and people
that we just met already ordering bottles by the cases. The caveat is we don't
have the funding to bring in our first order to the states - that's why we’re
here.  And that's where you come in.</p>
<p>We've been progressing
in stages, documenting our steps along the way. Now, imagine you being a part
of this endeavor. One day, you'll see our bottle at the liquor store or bar and
you'll be able to tell the person next to you that it's because of you that
tequila is on that shelf and being enjoyed by millions. How cool will that be?!
We're here to give you tequila that you'll be proud of, and you'll be glad to
know that it was your dollars that helped to create it.</p>
<p>We're a registered
U.S. company. We have a logo, chosen bottle design, and are currently working
on our licenses to import and sell tequila. We need funding to assist with the first runs of our tequila.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b><i>What do you get in return? </i></b></p>
<ul>
<li>The pride of knowing that your dollars helped to bring
     this premium tequila to the states - simply, being able to say that you're
     an original funder;</li>
<li>Receiving stylish Dos Cuernos swag;</li>
<li>Being featured in our social media posts and photos;</li>
<li>Invitation(s) to our launch party; </li>
<li>Promo opportunities; and more.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b><i>Why aren't we asking for bank loans, private equity or other
type of institutional financial commitments? </i></b></p>
<p>Easy! We want to
maintain as much control and stake in our company as possible. It's been our
creativity, ideas, style design, pacing and marketing that have elevated our
brand to what it is today. We want to keep it that way as we know that once our
tequila is in the states, it's going to be our ideas that take it to the next
level.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out our social media pages and website.</li>
<li>Check out our merchandise. </li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b><i>If there weren't risks involved, it wouldn't be interesting or
exciting.</i></b></p>
<p>Why would you trust
three guys from Austin, Texas, starting a tequila company? Honestly, I don't
have a good answer for that, and I probably wouldn’t trust them right off the
bat. However, the unknown is what makes this endeavor so exciting. </p>
<p>The only perceived
risk is Dos Cuernos' failure to launch. I am here to tell you that won’t
happen. The only unknown here is how big this brand will get. The only true
risk is not investing with us and regretting that you didn't help to originate
Dos Cuernos Tequila.</p>
<p>Dos Cuernos founders
Angel, Pete and Sylvester bring a mix of PR, marketing, recruiting, management,
sales, real estate and service industry expertise that somehow make the right
combustion of creativity and project management that is propelling our company
forward. We have a plan, and we have a brand, all we need is your dollars to
bring this tasty adult agave beverage across the border. From there, just like
you would a newly planted agave, stand back and watch it grow.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b><i>How else can you help? </i></b></p>
<p>Dollars are great as
well as word of mouth. If you can’t help us financially, go like us on
Facebook, buy some merchandise, follow us on Instagram, and help spread the
word of this distinguished drink.</p>

No Tequila, No Life. Know Tequila, Know Life. 
Our names are Angel
Gallegos, Peter Trevino and Sylvester Palacios, and we have a dream to launch
our own tequila in the next year. Is starting a tequila company a new thing? Of
course not. However, we're not celebrities or high income individuals starting
a tequila company just for kicks. We're three smart, entrepreneurial Hispanics
that love our background, heritage, and especially tequila, and want to bring
our tequila to the U.S. to share with our friends and family and eventually
grow it into something special.  
We have a brand that
is snowballing on social media, merchandise that is turning heads and people
that we just met already ordering bottles by the cases. The caveat is we don't
have the funding to bring in our first order to the states - that's why we’re
here.  And that's where you come in.
We've been progressing
in stages, documenting our steps along the way. Now, imagine you being a part
of this endeavor. One day, you'll see our bottle at the liquor store or bar and
you'll be able to tell the person next to you that it's because of you that
tequila is on that shelf and being enjoyed by millions. How cool will that be?!
We're here to give you tequila that you'll be proud of, and you'll be glad to
know that it was your dollars that helped to create it.
We're a registered
U.S. company. We have a logo, chosen bottle design, and are currently working
on our licenses to import and sell tequila. We need funding to assist with the first runs of our tequila.
What do you get in return? 

The pride of knowing that your dollars helped to bring
     this premium tequila to the states - simply, being able to say that you're
     an original funder;
Receiving stylish Dos Cuernos swag;
Being featured in our social media posts and photos;
Invitation(s) to our launch party; 
Promo opportunities; and more.

Why aren't we asking for bank loans, private equity or other
type of institutional financial commitments? 
Easy! We want to
maintain as much control and stake in our company as possible. It's been our
creativity, ideas, style design, pacing and marketing that have elevated our
brand to what it is today. We want to keep it that way as we know that once our
tequila is in the states, it's going to be our ideas that take it to the next
level.

Check out our social media pages and website.
Check out our merchandise. 

If there weren't risks involved, it wouldn't be interesting or
exciting.
Why would you trust
three guys from Austin, Texas, starting a tequila company? Honestly, I don't
have a good answer for that, and I probably wouldn’t trust them right off the
bat. However, the unknown is what makes this endeavor so exciting. 
The only perceived
risk is Dos Cuernos' failure to launch. I am here to tell you that won’t
happen. The only unknown here is how big this brand will get. The only true
risk is not investing with us and regretting that you didn't help to originate
Dos Cuernos Tequila.
Dos Cuernos founders
Angel, Pete and Sylvester bring a mix of PR, marketing, recruiting, management,
sales, real estate and service industry expertise that somehow make the right
combustion of creativity and project management that is propelling our company
forward. We have a plan, and we have a brand, all we need is your dollars to
bring this tasty adult agave beverage across the border. From there, just like
you would a newly planted agave, stand back and watch it grow.
How else can you help? 
Dollars are great as
well as word of mouth. If you can’t help us financially, go like us on
Facebook, buy some merchandise, follow us on Instagram, and help spread the
word of this distinguished drink.

<p>I'm Eric G. 25 year-old Argentine very
interested in social equality, enabling the pursuit of happiness for all and
eradicating extreme poverty in Latin America. </p>
<p>I embarked on this two year journey on
December 2012 with a dual purpose in mind:</p>
<p>1. I believe in the potential that
social businesses have to improve the livelihoods of those with the least and
effectively eradicate extreme poverty. As I travel I explore possible business
opportunities, establish connections and actively study and learn from past and
current organizations.</p>
<p>2. In 2012 I joined <a href=""http://www.aynah.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Aynah </a>seeing the possibilities this organization has in improving
standards of living around the globe through empowering groups to undertake
cooperative projects. As I travel, I spread the work of this organization on a
volunteer basis, finding new projects and visiting existing ones.</p>
<p><u>Trip
thus far</u></p>
<p>I began this
trip by moving back to Argentina to study business operations in Latin America. </p>
<p>After 7
months, and a short visit to the U.S, I embarked on my current journey, heading
to El Salvador and south from there - Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama,
Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, and currently Paraguay. </p>
<p>It has
been 11 months in the making. I work on rural farms for about three weeks
at a time and have lots of interesting conversations with farm workers, people
in the communities, cooperatives, other organizations, other volunteers,
universities, etc. I lost
about 20 pounds, gave first aid to a volunteer who chopped off his thumb with a
machete, got denied entry into Panama (only to be allowed in once my bus left
me), visited some incredible ruins, partook in Bolivian Carnaval and indigenous
ceremonies and saw and tried more fruits, vegetables and foods than I ever
realized existed.</p>
<p>Every country I have travelled to has
proven to be an enriching experience, being able to establish valuable
connections, explore several business ventures, and find new opportunities for
Aynah projects. I hope to continue this enriching experience to the very final
leg of the trip: the Caribbean.</p>
<p><u>Going
forward</u></p>
<p>I hope to visit the Dominican Republic
and Haiti to allow for the same types of exploration. As two of the most
poverty stricken countries in Latin America, the work I aim to undertake is
particularly relevant there. Reaching
these countries, however, proves to be a challenge due to a financial barrier.</p>
<p>I have self-funded my trip in its entirety, working
alongside locals in rural areas in exchange for
food and housing, and spending an average of $150 a month - mostly on
transportation. </p>
<p>I need $1,002 for plane travel to and
from the isle of Hispaniola, where I will then spend two months searching for
possibilities to work with social enterprises and possible projects to fund via
Aynah. Would you be able to help me reach this goal with a 25 dollar
25th-birthday gift? </p>
<p>Besides financial contributions I am
continuously searching for possible connections with non-profits, social
entrepreneurs, and any movement I can join leading to the eradication of
extreme poverty in Latin America. I highly appreciate any such connections,
information or links for organizations in the Dominican Republic and Haiti.</p>

<p>What's the difference between a Nature’s Sleep memory
foam mattress and the nationally advertised mattress – or any other memory foam
mattress?</p>
<p>We know, it's confusing. There
are many memory foam mattresses on the market making many different claims.
Every brand has its own formula – like Coke and Pepsi. But not all are created
equal. We think ours provides the superior combination of support, comfort,
affordability and sustainability. And using the latest technology available,
our mattresses are specifically designed to promote better health and
well-being. Our mattresses are also <a href=""http://certipur.us/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CertiPur</a> <span>approved where most of our
competitors are not. (Did we mention ours does it for less than half the price?)</span></p>
</div>
<div><span><span><p><b></b></p>
<p><b>I don't know where I'm living yet. Can I still order?</b></p>
<p>Yes! Just put in a temporary address. We will email you at the end of the campaign and you can set up delivery whenever you decide!</p>
<p><b>Will the mattress or foundation fit my bedroom furniture and frame?</b></p>
<p>Our mattresses and foundations will fit most standard US-size bed furniture and frames. The best way to tell is: does your current mattress fit, and is it the same size as ours? </p>
<p><b>Does the cover already come on the mattress upon delivery?</b></p>
<p>Yes, it does. </p>
<p><b>Would it damage the mattress to leave it packaged for a long period?</b></p>
<p>It will not be a problem at all as the mattress will be shipped vac-packed inside its packaging and preserved until it is opened. </p>
<p><b>What are the dimensions of each size bed?</b></p>
<p>All of our Memory Foam Mattresses are in standard sizes such as below:</p>
<p>Twin: 38"" x 75"" </p>
<p>Twin XL: 38"" x 80"" </p>
<p>Full: 54"" x 75"" </p>
<p>Queen: 60"" x 80"" </p>
<p>King: 76"" x 80"" </p>
<p><b>Can I use my own box spring or foundation?</b></p>
<p>If your previous foundation is in relatively good condition and is the same size as the mattress you ordered from us, you can use it. If it is not in good condition, in a different size or another reason, you can purchase a new foundation from us. </p>
<p><b>How can I get the status of my order?</b></p>
<p>Once you've received your order confirmation, please wait for an email with your FedEx tracking number. Once received, you can go to <a href=""http://www.FedEx.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.FedEx.com</a> to track your delivery. All orders usually process within three business days. You should receive a tracking number within seven business days. </p>
<p><b>How will I know that you’ve received my order?</b></p>
<p>Once you’ve placed your order, we'll send you an email confirmation. Please print or save the email for your records. </p>
<p><b>How are mattresses delivered?</b></p>
<p>Glad you asked (because it's pretty cool). All mattresses are shipped compressed and vacuum-packed and delivered by FedEx. This means that your mattress will arrive in a much smaller box than you're probably expecting. Don't be alarmed! It's just that we're using cutting-edge technology. As soon as you unpack your mattress, it will decompress to its normal size. Please make sure you open it in the room where you'll use it. And watch it open – you'll like what you see! </p>
<p><b>What are the mattress shipping weights and dimensions?</b></p>
<p>Typical shipping weights for mattresses range from 50lbs to 135lbs. The mattresses comes vacuum packed in a carton with measurements that range from a Twin 14” x 14” x 40” to a King 18"" x18” x 78”. </p>
<p><b>Are there any shipping or delivery charges?</b></p>
<p>Shipping or delivery charges are included in the cost of the product. </p>
<p><b>Does Nature's Sleep products come with warranties?</b></p>
<p>All Nature’s Sleep products are fully warrantied with proof of purchase from the Nature's Sleep website or an authorized retailer. Below is a brief guide on warranty lengths. Please check the product page for details on your specific item.</p></span></span></div>

<div></div>
<p>As many of you know, I spent fall
and winter of 2013 in Lyantonde, Uganda studying the intersection of gender and
natural resource management. Not only was this an amazing educational
experience, but it also gave me the opportunity to create relationships and put
names and faces to this area of research that I had previously only read about
in academic papers and books. </p>
<p>Much of the research I had done both
prior to arriving in Uganda and what I witnessed during my time there was
extremely disheartening.  Uganda has
the highest rate of deforestation in East Africa. The country is
losing forests at a rate of about 80,000 hectares per year —approximately
the size of New York City’s land mass — and could lose most of its
forest cover in the next 40 years if deforestation continues at the
current rate. This deforestation and the resulting loss of
carbon-sequestration have caused a change in climate and
rainfall has decreased significantly. Water sources are
limited while soil erosion destroys farmland throughout the country. </p>
<p>Those
who suffer from environmental degradation the most
are small-scale farmers, who in Uganda’s case are
predominantly female. Approximately 90% of rural women work
in agriculture versus 53% of men. These women, especially
the poor, work almost double the time of men in the community, yet
have little formal control over the crops they produce and the land
they work on. As the backbone of the home, women are primary food
providers and spend much of their time in search of firewood and water
for cooking, placing them in constant contact with natural
resources. When these resources are
diminished, it is women who are the first to feel the effects.
They are the ones who walk the extra 5 miles to find fuel wood and water in order
to provide food for their families, and risk sexual assault as these walks grow
longer.</p>

<p>During
my stay, I had the opportunity to spend <span>time speaking and learning from rural women in the area. From
these conversations and friendships, I learned about the fierce resilience of rural Ugandan women, despite the many struggles </span><span>they face on a daily basis. As I have
learned more about Africa, I have observed that there is a general perception
of the ""African woman"" as being vulnerable and weak, someone who is
in need of ""empowerment""
and saving. My experience interacting with women in Uganda proved this
stereotype false over and over again. I learned that despite their struggles, there are Ugandan
women that are taking matters into their own hands, placing their hands in the
soil, and planting trees. </span></p>
<p><b>We need your help!</b></p>
<p><span>This is where you come in. I had the privilege of spending time with two amazing women's
led reforestation groups: The Kimuli Women's Group and the Tukwaszwamu
Group. These groups were such a beacon of hope and inspiration during my
experience in Uganda, and I with this fundraiser I am hoping to provide some financial
support for the work that they do. Here is their story. </span></p>
<p><b>Tukwaszwamu Group</b></p>
<p><span>Ms.
Kolama Mariam is a widowed farmer living in the Lyantonde Districtof Southern Uganda, and the founder of the Tukwaszmanu
Group. Mariam has managed to facilitate the planting of 9 acres of trees on hillsides
surrounding Lyantonde’s main watershed, and intends to keep planting.  After her husband died,
Mariam was
left with a large portion of land to tend between herself and her children. Because her
family owned a small shop in the trading center, she spent much of her time
away from her land. As a result, people in the community began chopping the
hillsides and burning trees for charcoal. Although she knew this was occurring,
she felt that
there was little she could do to stop it. She saw deforestation was occurring throughout the region,
and knew her community was struggling because of it. Mariam drafted a
project proposal for the restoration of bare hills surrounding the water shed through
tree planting. After the project was approved, Mariam recruited other
community members, mostly other widows, to form the Tukwaszwamu group, or “let’s all come together” in the
Luganda language. After receiving funding for seedlings from the
United Nations Development Program, the group began planting up the hillsides.</span></p>

<p>“We
looked for people who were somewhat vulnerable, and widows,” says Mariam. She told me that at first, the main motivation for people
to join the group was poverty eradication, as the trees would be cut and sold
for income once they grew older.With money as motivation, the group continued planting, despite many trees serving as
snacks for grazing cattle and villagers continuing to bush burn periodically. Gradually, Mariam began to notice
the subtle benefits of the trees as their roots sank deeper into the ground, holding the soil together. Later, the
group was able to distribute seedlings to the community and educate people
about the importance of planting trees, not only for income, but for
restoring the health of their environment. “People are becoming
sensitized about growing trees,” says Mariam.  ""We have come up with seminars to inform
people about the importance of trees and the disadvantages of cutting trees. We have learned a lot
from growing
trees in our community.” She says that these trees have had specific benefits for women. “When women have eucalyptus trees around their
house they no longer have to walk long distances in search of firewood.”</p>
<p><b><span>The Kimuli Women's Group</span></b></p>
<p>The Kimuli Women’s Group is <span>an agricultural and social cooperation of 32 women that was
formed in 2000. These women travel to different communities to perform drama and
music to
sensitize people about HIV and challenges that rural women face. Olivia, the vice chairperson
and founder of the group says that she started the group so that women in
the area can be joined under one umbrella. “It has created unity among women. If a
woman gets
a problem, she can be helped by the group.” One of their intentions is to generate income so that
they could pay their children’s school fees. One of the initial goals of the group had been to
reforest the hillsides in the area so that they could later sell them for income
generation, while also improving the soil quality of their farms. They later added
the drama aspect of the group in order to create social change surrounding the
issues that rural women face. </span></p>

<p>What really amazed me about these two groups was that they were created and run by women themselves. They build on existing structures rather than imposing new and complicated projects that run the risk of doing more damage than good. Prior to traveling to Uganda, I had heard an array of development and empowerment project horror stories, in which an Western NGO attempts to empower or develop local communities without really understanding the situation that the people live in. These groups know what they need, they know how to do it, they just need financial support. Through planting trees, these projects address women's empowerment, poverty eradication, and improving the health of the environment that supports them. It astounded me that more of these groups are not recognized, and that I had not heard more about these kinds of projects. It showed me that much of the work that women do is invisible. Like roots, they are Uganda's life support system, yet the work they do lies out if sight and is seldom recognized by the rest of the world. </p>

</div> </div> <div> <h3>The fundraiser</h3>
<div>With your help, I am hoping to raise $1000 USD for the Kimuli Women's Group and the Tukwaszwamu Group. On June 13th, I am going to run my race, the <a href=""http://www.skagwaymarathon.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Skagway Half-Marathon</a> here in mountainous Skagway, Alaska and am hoping that you will sponsor me. I thought that this would be a good way to use my passion of running and connecting with nature, as a means to support these two groups financially. They are in need of funding in order to buy more seedlings and set up more nurseries where they can grow the trees. These trees will then be grown and sold as as poles, timber, and fruit while also protecting the soil on hillsides. The Kimuli Women's Group also mentioned that they are in need more more supplies for setting up their drama acts, as right now they are performing on their own time and dime, which has been extremely difficult. I understand that in donating to charities there is a risk of your money not going where it is intended to go, so this is a great opportunity to know that your donations will be directly benefiting not only these women, but their families and the communities at large. </div>
<div>The donations will be sent to <a href=""http://www.racobao.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RACOBAO</a>, the organization that I worked with during my time in Uganda, as they are in connection with both and are how I first was able to come in contact with these groups.

<h3>WHY IN ISRAEL?</h3>
<p>Obviously, our Team has personal ties with Israel, but also with other many countries.</p>
<p>There was also THE VISION, to make possible “the return of the exiles” and “the blossom of the desert”, a hard job anyway.</p>
<p>But in the other hand, it’s well known that Israel is a pioneer country in Eco-Technologies and encouraging  the creation of start-up projects.  Giving support to all kind of Green Tech- Clean Tech and environment preserve initiatives, changing their politics in order to make it easier.</p>
<p>As a Private Business Initiative Project we have agreed with the State of Israel the following points:</p>
<p>  -   Support to the infrastructure and civil construction.</p>
<p>  -   Fiscal Benefits for 10 years.</p>
<p>  -   Funding for new industry establishment.</p>
<p>  -   Designating a general coordinator between the Project and the different Ministries.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">  -   Technical support in different areas : urban planning, security, etc</span></p>

  -   Support to the infrastructure and civil construction.
  -   Fiscal Benefits for 10 years.
  -   Funding for new industry establishment.
  -   Designating a general coordinator between the Project and the different Ministries.
  -   Technical support in different areas : urban planning, security, etc

<h3>Who Are Hoes for Hillary?</h3>
<p>Hillary Operatives Engaging Strategically, otherwise known as HOES, aim to inspire the Citizens of United States to vote, not for who Hillary is, but for what she believes in and her stance on important issues (and to do so in an engaging manner). </p>
<p>Beyond this, we're making fun of this election and it's media portrayal through t-shirt art. You can see more about the issues we care about on our website: hoesforhillary.us</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Goals of HOES</h3>
<p>Hillary Operatives Engaging Strategically have the following goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>To raise awareness of Hillary's stance on important issues that are in precarious positions</strong>; to help people better understand the consequences if they do not vote for Hillary. You don't have to care about all these issues--just one of them will do.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Perform outreach to the Bros for Bernie who are burnt out on Hillary</strong>. You may not like who she is, but your vote could mean that your freedoms are protected, and that the change you would like to see in the world actually happens.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Encourage people to vote by through t-shirt advertising and creating plans for voting</strong>--finding their polling location and making an appointment on peoples' calendars<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>To raise the amount of money that we would like to donate to the Hilary campaign</strong> but do not currently have budget to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p><i><strong>Please note</strong>: Hillary has no knowledge of and has not endorsed this campaign. It is completely rogue. However, all profits made will be donated to the Hillary campaign.</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our T-Shirts</h3>
<p>We have created the following t-shirts to raise awareness of the mission and also to generate  the amount we would like to donate:</p>
<p>CAPITOL HILL<br/> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473696304/jw1my7gdww5vmflwtlg5.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Capitol Hill was designed to underline the importance of this election. There are many important issues at stake. We would like to take away the spotlight from details about Hillary as a person, and focus on her stance on issues.  </p>
<p>Want to know more about this issues we think are most important? Go to hoesforhillary.us</p>

<p>Our Can't Dance, Loves Pants t-shirt reflects the constant media barrage of facts about Hillary that try to distract Americans from more important issues at stake (<a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3764348/Clinton-recycles-year-s-monochrome-outfit-solicits-advice-debate-Donald-Trump-Hamptons-fundraiser.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Exhibit A</a>). We too have bad dance moves and have been known to wear the same outfit twice, but that doesn't affect our ability to do our jobs. We encourage people to vote for Hillary because of her stance on issues and her history of executing on things she cares about, and that's all.  </p>
<p>Hoes for Hillary</p>

<p>This t-shirt represents the nuanced challenge represented by the fact that Hillary is a woman. There are clear double-standards in the media that she must overcome, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-sexist-double-standards-hurting-hillary-clinton/2016/02/12/fb551e38-d195-11e5-abc9-ea152f0b9561_story.html?utm_term=.7bc935fa0c69"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">explained here</a>. This t-shirt makes fun of the social construct placed on women, and encourages the rest of us women to stand with her.</p>

<p>This t-shirt represents the fact that Trump is offering partnership with Russia in order to enhance his own financial gain. <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/27/the-trump-russia-money-question-in-24-steps/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">See more information here.</a> </p>

Please note: Hillary has no knowledge of and has not endorsed this campaign. It is completely rogue. However, all profits made will be donated to the Hillary campaign.

Our T-Shirts
We have created the following t-shirts to raise awareness of the mission and also to generate  the amount we would like to donate:
CAPITOL HILL 

Capitol Hill was designed to underline the importance of this election. There are many important issues at stake. We would like to take away the spotlight from details about Hillary as a person, and focus on her stance on issues.  
Want to know more about this issues we think are most important? Go to hoesforhillary.us
Can't Dance. Loves Pants.

Our Can't Dance, Loves Pants t-shirt reflects the constant media barrage of facts about Hillary that try to distract Americans from more important issues at stake (Exhibit A). We too have bad dance moves and have been known to wear the same outfit twice, but that doesn't affect our ability to do our jobs. We encourage people to vote for Hillary because of her stance on issues and her history of executing on things she cares about, and that's all.  
Hoes for Hillary


Stand with us, and show that you're standing with us, with your very own Hoes For Hillary t-shirt.  
Hills for Hill

This t-shirt represents the nuanced challenge represented by the fact that Hillary is a woman. There are clear double-standards in the media that she must overcome, explained here. This t-shirt makes fun of the social construct placed on women, and encourages the rest of us women to stand with her.
Make America Slutty Again
This t-shirt represents the fact that Trump is offering partnership with Russia in order to enhance his own financial gain. See more information here. 
Have any more questions? Please email us at hillaryhoes@gmail.com or visit our website: hoesforhillary.us
Risks & Challenges
There are no risks that you will not receive a t-shirt. Due to working with third party vendors, there is a slight risk in delay.

I am very familiar with the constant fear of SIDS and I know of many more parents out there just like me with the same concern. SIDS is the #1 leading cause of infant deaths in the Unites States and my heart breaks for parents when I hear a news story about another infant who died suddenly while they were supposed to be safe in their crib. I refuse to believe that I am the only mother who checks her baby throughout the night to make sure she’s still breathing. I know I’m not the only parent whose biggest fear is going to reach for my baby only to realize the horror of finding my baby died while I was sleeping. I don't believe any parent should have to go through the pain of losing their baby, but it happens every day.  There has to be a way to help and I think I can.</p>
<p> I've come up with an idea that I believe will drastically reduce the risk of SIDS based on research that has already been done. I’ve already discussed the idea confidentially with a well-known and reputable company that will help me with the process of getting it designed and patented.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>My name is Mark Laymon and <em>Caffeine Spaces</em> is a network of coworking spaces I am launching for the local tech community. I would like you to be a part of this project from the very start!<br/></strong></p>
<p>For the past three years I have hosted tech related events. Each event is focused on a different type of niche. Our monthly attendance varies from 30 to 125 attendees. One of the main requests I receive from the members is for a full time location for them to call home for their mobilized businesses. I am submitting this crowdfunding campaign to accomplish two goals. One is to offer a highly reduced membership plan for the members prelaunch of our opening day. Two is to cover some of the basic costs for desks, chairs, and tables.</p>
<p>We have a lot of renovation to complete before we open. Carpets need upkeep, walls need to be adjusted, and with new walls we need new paint! To cover the minimum requirements is our priority at this time. This allows us to have a clean and friendly location for everyone to enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>I want to send a special Thank You to the <a href=""http://www.edc-tech.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Enterprise Development Corporation of South Florida"">Enterprise Development Corporation</a> and the <a href=""http://www.research-park.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Research Park at Florida Atlantic University"">Research Park at Florida Atlantic University</a>!</strong> With the help of the EDC and Research Park we are now able to make this location possible for us to launch our first location in South Florida!</p>

<p><strong>Why Coworking?</strong> <br/> Is the coffee shop you are working at discouraging you from squatting all day at one of their many tables? You bought at least one of their overpriced drinks didn't you? Having an affordable and welcoming coworking space is my solution.</p>
<p>The local coffee shop I have worked at for the past year has gone so far as to cover their power outlets! What about renting an executive office space for your startup? Do you want to have a one year contract for a company that may only take 90 days to launch? What will you do with the office with the remaining nine months? Is your lease transferable? Maybe you should stay at home? You don't mind having clients see your laundry do you? These are just a few things you need to contemplate before you decide to join a coworking space.</p>
<p><strong>What is Coworking?</strong><br/> Basically, coworking or shared office spaces are arrangements that a business owner makes with a building owner to share the office space and resources. <em>See <a href=""http://coworking.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Coworking.com"">http://coworking.com/</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coworking"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coworking"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coworking</a></em></p>
<p>What we are creating is as close to a professional business clubhouse as possible. All the amenities of a large office are included, but none of the overhead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Caffeine Spaces</em></strong> is developing a community driven office space to help like minded individuals that want to work in a group environment, achieve economies of scale without being a big company and enjoy being open and part of the community that value collaboration, openness, community, accessibility and sustainability. But this is just the beginning of what <strong><em>Caffeine Spaces</em></strong> is offering.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Becoming a coworking member is much more than renting a desk, it is joining a community of like minded individuals that want to work in a group environment, but still have the flexibility of working for yourself.</p>
<p><strong><em>Caffeine Spaces</em></strong> is the first step many will take out from their home based business office. We cover this niche with multiple ways for the worker to become comfortable going out on their own, yet still have a community to fall back on when necessary. It takes very little out of pocket expense to become a coworker.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">""<strong><em>Caffeine Spaces</em></strong> is created by Mark Laymon (that's me) to introduce coworking into the South Florida communities. As a work from home father, I ran across the day to day inefficiencies of not being in an office environment. Just the ability to collaborate my thoughts on a whiteboard to my peers would be enough to acquire an executive office space. Not to mention the ravaging effects of cabin fever from spending countless hours every day in one room was mind numbing. But the thought of a true executive office space was way more overkill than necessary for my work.""<br/><br/></p>
<p>While attending several tech related social events in Miami I came across the Coworking movement. I could see there was something worthwhile for myself and my local peers to gather at a communal location, but still have individuality to work for ourselves.</p>
<p>•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••</p>
<p><strong>What are the funds we raise on IndieGoGo used for?</strong> <br/> Desks, tables, chairs, printers, servers, high speed internet / wifi / router, projectors / screens, cleaning supplies, and all of the basic equipment that a coworking office needs to run efficiently. It is not going to financing the corporate structure, only decor and physical hardware.</p>
<p><strong>What are the benefits to the community?</strong><br/> We a suffering a brain drain of tech startups and entrepreneurs in South Florida. By creating a network of coworking spaces I hope to have an impact in keeping more of the talent locally. Your support is key to this project. Without the local support and participation more of our local talent will be forced to migrate to other competing locations to ply their trades. <strong><em>Caffeine Spaces</em></strong> will create a minimum of 15 jobs at the Boca Raton location with many more in the future spaces. This creates an added value to each region we develop at.</p>
<p><strong>Where are the <em>Caffeine Spaces</em> located?</strong><br/><strong>Boca Raton will be the home for our first location.</strong> The space is 11,000 square feet. Our proposed seating arrangement is it have a mix of hot desks, fixed desks, and executive offices to be used on a day to day basis. Don't forget the phone booths to make those ""private calls"" private. We also will include a kitchen and several full sized conference rooms along with a pod-casting/green room. We are located in the Research Park of Florida Atlantic University.</p>

<p><strong>Pledge $50 or more</strong><br/> Do you like T-shirts?

For $150 your logo will be displayed on the back of our <strong><em>Caffeine Spaces</em></strong> t-shirts with a limit of 50 sponsors.</p>
<p><strong>Pledge $800 or more</strong><br/>*** Startup Special $800 = 90 day passes! You do the math! ***<br/>Are you a startup? Have more than two people on your team? I have special for you. 90 day passes for your company to share between yourselves.</p>

•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••<br/><p><strong>Why are we asking for only $18,500 in pledges when it costs more to launch?</strong><br/>This is the bare minimum to purchase the hardware and décor needed to open our network of locations. But this is just a start in our fund raising goals. Each time we reach a goal in pledges the lower our overall costs will be to complete the launch. It also gives our future members a way to prove their support in our community. The ultimate goal for us to reach is $100,000. Reaching the ultimate goal will lower fundraising time from our schedule and we will incorporate that time into future growth, plus it reduces the overall fees required from our members. The more funds we raise from this CrowdFunding campaign the lower we can set our membership rates.</p>
<p>•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••</p>
<p>*NOTE: Funds raised via CrowdFunding will NOT be used to finance the operations. They will be used to supply and furnish a dedicated coworking space that the members of the tech community can utilize.</p>

<p>The woman behind this mission is a true inspiration. Thirty three  years ago Ann Marie Zon began the Nicaraguan Mission Project to help the poorest of the poor in that country. The project located in Buffalo, New York is made possible by  dedicated volunteers who give freely of their time to organize and pack donated items, all of which are much needed.  After arrival in Nicaragua Ann’s volunteers distribute the boxes.</p>
<p>We need $32,500 to build the first playground in the area of Rivas Nicaragua! Children from many villages will be able to gather and play as children should. All funds will go to benefit the children. If we don’t meet our goal the money will go to fund ongoing established children’s projects including the children’s food kitchen, the cow project for providing milk, and sending children to school for education. If you are interested in learning more about these existing projects go to <a href=""http://www.projectnica.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.projectnica.org</a>.</p>
<p>This playground will have a huge impact on children who only know work and poverty. Children playing is not typical. Little kids watch other kids work, or they are gathering water and firewood for their family. With this playground they can intermingle and play like kids.</p>
<p> The Impact:</p>
<p> <strong>Joy  and  Laughter are immeasurable!</strong></p>

<h3>Short Summary:</h3>
<p>The Denver Community Health Collective is a low cost, volunteer run clinic offering alternative health care in Central Denver. We are dedicated to providing holistic, accessible and affordable health care to our communities.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Our Story</strong>:</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">We started DCHC in response to an overwhelming need in our community for health care. Our community of friends and neighbors are mostly uninsured, and going to the ER for things like chronic headaches, sprains, and most of all stress, is just not an option. We have also worked with many people who after having discriminatory and traumatizing experiences in western medical facilities about their gender, race or class status, simply do not feel safe in healthcare settings anymore. So we look to eachother, ask around, or just live with the pain. Since most of us healers were in school, had jobs, kids and busy lives, we thought we would try to consolidate the work we were doing with friends by making sundays a health day in our basement! In the last 2 years we have since moved from the basement to a warehouse in the 27 social center, and finally to our clinic we have now, an actual office with doors, carpet and windows!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>We need $6000 to launch our clinic into full time status! The $6000 will:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Pay rent and expenses for 3 months, which will:</li>
<li>Allow us to hire a community member to be our clinic director, who will run the clinic, set the appointments, do outreach to potential clients and volunteers, and set up classes, workshops and events throughout the year. Hiring her will allow us to:</li>
<li>Be open full time, starting at 4 days a week, with hopes of eventually 5 days a week.</li>
<li>Update our facilities. We have been using all donated and out of pocket supplies and furniture. We would like to be able to buy:                               -a new desk,                                                                                              -a larger filing cabinet,                                                                                 -a supply of oils, liniments, and new sheets,                                                  -a stock of paper towels, toilet paper, hand soap and cleaning supplies,           -outreach &amp; advertising supplies, including fliers, posters and small ads</li>
<li>After 3 months we hope for the clinic to be fully self sustainable, even if every client only pays the minimum $10 on our sliding scale.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Services include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Massage Therapy </li>
<li>Acupressure</li>
<li>Traditional Aztec Medicine</li>
<li>Herbal Consultations</li>
<li>Doula Care</li>
<li>Craniosacral Therapy</li>
<li>Counseling &amp; Psychotherapy Consultations</li>
<li>Support navigating low income health care/ hospital/ clinic systems</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>What do you get?</p>
<p>Besides having increased access to a wonderful community health resource, how 'bout those amazing perks?! Handmade amazing products, massages, and herbs!!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will let us be able to go from offering services 1 day a week to 4. We are currently able to provide about 6 appointments a week. With our new hours and paid position, we will be able to provide more like 24 appointments a week! And that's just to start. If things go well, we will continue to grow as much as we can. Not to mention expanding our herbal apothacary and workshop programs!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<ul>
<li>Rent = 300$/mo x 3mo= $900 (We are lucky to have inexpensive rent!)</li>
<li>Utilities (Gas/Electric/Internet/Phone) = $50/ mo x 3= $150</li>
<li>Supplies for 3 months:</li>
</ul>
<p>- Massage oil $28/gallon , liniments $20/ 2 bottles</p>
<p>- Natural Laundry soap $11</p>
<p>- Natural Hand Soap $25</p>
<p>- Toilet paper $36</p>
<p>- Paper towels $24</p>
<p>Total for supplies for 3 mo= $144</p>
<ul>
<li>Labor (Office manager position)= $1500/ month x 3mo= $4,500</li>
<li>Outreach costs = $68 for 1000 flyers and posters. Not a regularly repeating cost.</li>
<li>Desk and filing cabinet = $120</li>
<li>Indigogo perk supplies= $50</li>
</ul>
<p>Total= $5864</p>
<p>Our income:</p>
<p>Minimum cost per treatment = $10</p>
<p>Number of Treatments available per month being open 4 days a week = 96</p>
<p>96 treatments x $10 = $960</p>
<p>We are also renting out our treatment rooms to practitioners to cover the rest of the costs, at a slding scale rate of $50-100 per month.</p>
<p>In addtion, we are in the process of applying for comprehensive fiscal sponsorship with the Colorado Non-profit Development Center. View their website here:<a href=""http://www.cndc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""CNDC"">http://www.cndc.org/</a></p>
<p>With fiscal sponsorship, we will be able to apply for grants to fund our project more substantially.</p>
<p>Lastly, we will be doing ongoing fundraising as a big part of our work. Fundraisers in the past have been very successful! We've had a poker tournament, a pie night social, and seasonal potlucks. In the future we are planning to fundraise through community workshops,classes, dinners, bingo nights, and more!</p>
