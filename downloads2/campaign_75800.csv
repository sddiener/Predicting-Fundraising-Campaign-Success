In order to get the website going (Build up and first server hosting) is going to come down to a total of 2000 €. But don't worry! I will pitch in on my own as much as I can. But that is not what I want most of you (I'm not Scrooge MacDuck). I want you to go and browse the website when it's up! A site with no users is no site at all.
Now where is the money going to go? A professional HTML, PHP, MySQL and CSS code writer. He will make sure the site is professional and (almost) bug free. 
  But how much does it matter? How much will my contribution make a diffrence? 
To be able to laugh is something very dear to most people I know. It can help you out on a rainy day, when things just don't work out as you would like to.
With every contribution I receive I will be able to pay for not only the website builder, but also for a larger server which would make the website far more available. 
  Risks & Challenges Where do I want to take the site? 
I want it it to become self-sustaining; The website will be funded by advertisements. Don't worry! None of those sound adds and pop up bullcrap. Just banners (provided by Google adsense to make sure those ads actually make sense). Further more I want the site to have its private server one day. This is expensive but if the site has enough users this can be done 
  Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help: 
Spread the word! The more people on the site when it launches, the better. Have an idea that you think would be perfect for the site? Came up with a (better) slogun? Have a far more amazing idea for a logo? Let me know! Everything is welcome.

<p>Throughout the years, we have connected with people who have different traits and skills that make them unique.  They speak multiple languages,  know the locals, know ins and outs, and have skill sets like, Linguistics, Computer Programming, Automotive training, and many more, that could potentially help hundreds of people.  However, some of us don't know how useful our seemingly basic skills &amp; connections are.  The Social Organization's goal is to bring these connections to a common meeting point to be productive.  We aim to connect and build communities through the platforms of visual art, video, writing, music, and hands-on projects.  This campaign will demonstrate how this organization will operate in the future.  50% to the community/charitable cause, 50% to the organization and future projects.  For this campaign, funds will do just that.</p>

<p> In October 2014, Cody Langford founder of the charity, ""Remember Syria"" traveled to Turkey for a humanitarian aid mission.  The mission was simple: go to southern Turkey, buy clothing, and with the help of local contacts, distribute the clothing to refugees along the Syrian border. This is what I (Tyler Smith) hope to achieve this month on behalf of this California based charity. Using the same contacts, bringing $1,500 and distributing it accordingly will be a very simple task, and it will help a great number of the people effected by Syria's conflict. If the goal is not reached for the campaign, every dollar under $1,500 will go to this mission. For more info about how this mission will work, follow this link.<span></span></p>

be a data base for like-minded individuals interested in helping others.  Our network is your network.  None of your connections have to be shared on this website and communicating with people on this website will be done through their own means (Links to Facebook, Twitter, Etc).

<h2>The Quick Story<br/>
</h2><p>Hi. We are two ordinary folk. My name is Max Jacobs and with Jillian
Spruyt, who works through the Mongolian Outreach Mission, we are passionate about
helping the poor and disadvantaged people of Mongolia, especially orphans,
street kids, and the homeless. Since 2007, Jillian, a Nursing Assistant by
profession, has worked on many projects in Mongolia. She has helped build a Soup
Kitchen, a Kindergarten school, a centre for autistic children, and a Drop-in
Clinic for street children and their families; she has helped the Desert Rose
Centre get girls off the streets; raised money to supply homes to families
living on the streets, and provided school books and a new kitchen for the
Reindeer People (Tsaatan) and their children. Working from Canada and with
retirement from a long human resources career looming ahead, I have committed
myself to helping Jillian raise the funds she needs for her good works. The
Mongolian Outreach Mission ""aims to alleviate child poverty, and help those less
fortunate, in Mongolia"". One of our current projects is to assist a group of
disabled people equip their center, the <b>Chingeltei Disabled Peoples’ Centre</b> so they can begin to acquire the
skills needed for entry-level jobs in Ulaanbaatar’s growing job market.
 But we need your help. </p>
<p>We need to raise 5375 USD to cover the cost of 6 computers, 6 desks and 6
chairs for the Centre or many disabled people in the Capital city will not gain
their independence. So we're turning to the good folks out there who strongly
support our efforts and ask for your contributions. In exchange, we're offering
you an opportunity to receive any one of six perks that will recognize you in Mongolia as contributors to a worth while cause. You will get your name on a permanent plaque to be prominently displayed in the centre, and various contribution levels will enhance the prominence of your name on the plaque from that of a Friend at the lowest level to Ambassador at the top contribution level. See our perk descriptions <i>(to the right of this page)</i> for more details. Your contribution
will help us help a group of disabled persons gain their independence through
self-sufficiency, and further, it will help the Mongolian Outreach Mission fulfill
its ""aim to ...help those less fortunate, in
Mongolia”. Thanks!</p>
<br/><p></p><h2>
<b>A Little More Detail</b><br/>
</h2><p>My name is <a href=""http://max-jacobs.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Max Jacobs</a>, human
resources professional and a Canadian who worked in the mining industry in
Mongolia for a little more than 3 years. During that time I got to see first-hand the kind of poverty and difficult situations
many Mongolians have to endure in their daily lives. Life for many thousands and thousands is a
desperate struggle!</p>
<p>It was in 2007, before I left
Ulaanbaatar, that I met Jillian Spruyt–McNeil and her husband. I was struck by
her unwavering desire to help the less fortunate and I have followed her good
works since that time. Her accomplishments have been many and her commitment to
help reflects the very best in human nature. Undoubtedly, for many Mongolians
she has become their “Angel of Mercy”.</p>
<p>Jillian saw the need and started
working through the <b>Mongolian Outreach
Mission</b> “to
alleviate child poverty, and help those less fortunate, in Mongolia”. As a
result of her efforts, some of her great work has included the following: <i>(See her CV for more details)</i><br/></p>

The Quick Story
Hi. We are two ordinary folk. My name is Max Jacobs and with Jillian
Spruyt, who works through the Mongolian Outreach Mission, we are passionate about
helping the poor and disadvantaged people of Mongolia, especially orphans,
street kids, and the homeless. Since 2007, Jillian, a Nursing Assistant by
profession, has worked on many projects in Mongolia. She has helped build a Soup
Kitchen, a Kindergarten school, a centre for autistic children, and a Drop-in
Clinic for street children and their families; she has helped the Desert Rose
Centre get girls off the streets; raised money to supply homes to families
living on the streets, and provided school books and a new kitchen for the
Reindeer People (Tsaatan) and their children. Working from Canada and with
retirement from a long human resources career looming ahead, I have committed
myself to helping Jillian raise the funds she needs for her good works. The
Mongolian Outreach Mission ""aims to alleviate child poverty, and help those less
fortunate, in Mongolia"". One of our current projects is to assist a group of
disabled people equip their center, the Chingeltei Disabled Peoples’ Centre so they can begin to acquire the
skills needed for entry-level jobs in Ulaanbaatar’s growing job market.
 But we need your help. 
We need to raise 5375 USD to cover the cost of 6 computers, 6 desks and 6
chairs for the Centre or many disabled people in the Capital city will not gain
their independence. So we're turning to the good folks out there who strongly
support our efforts and ask for your contributions. In exchange, we're offering
you an opportunity to receive any one of six perks that will recognize you in Mongolia as contributors to a worth while cause. You will get your name on a permanent plaque to be prominently displayed in the centre, and various contribution levels will enhance the prominence of your name on the plaque from that of a Friend at the lowest level to Ambassador at the top contribution level. See our perk descriptions (to the right of this page) for more details. Your contribution
will help us help a group of disabled persons gain their independence through
self-sufficiency, and further, it will help the Mongolian Outreach Mission fulfill
its ""aim to ...help those less fortunate, in
Mongolia”. Thanks!

A Little More Detail
My name is Max Jacobs, human
resources professional and a Canadian who worked in the mining industry in
Mongolia for a little more than 3 years. During that time I got to see first-hand the kind of poverty and difficult situations
many Mongolians have to endure in their daily lives. Life for many thousands and thousands is a
desperate struggle!
It was in 2007, before I left
Ulaanbaatar, that I met Jillian Spruyt–McNeil and her husband. I was struck by
her unwavering desire to help the less fortunate and I have followed her good
works since that time. Her accomplishments have been many and her commitment to
help reflects the very best in human nature. Undoubtedly, for many Mongolians
she has become their “Angel of Mercy”.
Jillian saw the need and started
working through the Mongolian Outreach
Mission “to
alleviate child poverty, and help those less fortunate, in Mongolia”. As a
result of her efforts, some of her great work has included the following: (See her CV for more details)

2007: Raised 20,000 USD and built a gym, community
     centre and soup kitchen facility.
2008: Helped build Rainbow centre for autistic children.
2009/10: Raised 20,000 USD for Desert Rose Centre for Street Girls
     - bought bedding, beds, tables, furniture for kitchen and computers for
     the centre. Now the girls can sleep, wash and eat there instead of
the streets.
2009: Raised 20,000 USD the Christina Noble Foundation to
     facilitate the small Drop-in Clinic attached to Mother and Child Hospital,
     for street children and their families when they need medical attention.

     Catholic Mission, in Erdenet.
2009: Assisted in raising 13,000 USD to purchase land and
     playground equipment for Kindergarten school for CICM Catholic Mission, in
     Erdenet. 
Between 2007 and 2009: Raised approx 5000 USD  for a program called Give a Ger, with
     Christina Noble Foundation, for Gers (called Yurts in other Central Asian
     countries) for families in need, to stop them sleeping on the streets.

2009 – 2010: Raised approx 5,000.00 USD for the Reindeer people, (Tsaatan)
     Children, Tsaagan Nuur, for school books and new kitchen for reindeer
     people and their children.

  The Impact My real goal is the set up this agency in a way that is can service other investments vertically.  For example, I want to invest in a restaurant, and later a hotel; having this agency will be in place for horizontal growth.  
Risks & Challenges There is a lot of competition in this field.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Garnet Terri and Mama Terri deliberated over that weekend and by Monday
several people had sampled different flavors of “Terri’s Cakes”. Everyone
agreed that the Terri’s were on to something. Shortly thereafter, countless people were polled and asked “where do you buy your baked goods in Detroit?”. No
one had an immediate answer. After thinking about it, they weren’t sure of one
regular place that they always went to grab their favorite dessert. The Terri's wanted
to change that! </p>
<p>As the customer base began to grow, the Terri’s began deliberating on what
the vision of Terri’s Cakes Detroit would be. They agreed that they had no
interest in using artificial food, dyes, or anything that was harmful to the
body. They didn’t want their cakes processed. They wanted to sustain the home
baked taste of “Grandma’s cooking.” The Terri’s began creating recipes for
different diets: no sugar, low sugar, diabetic friendly, gluten-free, vegan,
egg free, milk free, nut allergies… you name it, they figured it out! Customers
began calling in with all kinds of interesting suggestions:</p>
<p>“I tasted a
chocolate chile pepper candy bar last night and it was delicious, do you think
you could create a cupcake with this flavor combination?” – The day before the
cocoa caliente cupcake was created </p>
<p>“My boyfriend
loves banana pudding cake and I hear that you all have the best banana pudding
in Detroit. Do you have a banana pudding cake?” – Now we do! Two layers of
vegan banana cake filled with vanilla wafers, freshly sliced bananas, homemade
vanilla pudding and whipped cream! </p>
<p>Let’s travel back a little bit … after graduating from college, Garnet
Terri moved overseas to “gain a sense of identity.” In her time overseas, she
observed the close knit community that surrounded her. She noticed how the
society took care of their own. She noticed that everyone seemed to be interested
in helping others and helping build the community. As her contract came to an
end, she knew that she wanted and needed to return home to Detroit and help
rebuild the community. Though her career is community focused, she had no
desire to further develop this business if there was no community aspect. </p>
<p>As the Terri’s Cakes Brand continues to develop, it is developing into more
than just a bakery. Terri’s Cakes Detroit wants to be a community space,
a kitchen that people can walk in and be reminded of sitting on the stoop at

Through the movement Todos Por La Niñez, our hope is that global citizens and Bolivians will unite behind an agenda for youth, become child advocates, and life-long supporters of local children’s causes.
Your support will allow us to engage Bolivians in a dialogue that goes beyond children’s rights and create local opportunities for immediate action. The 9 organizations that are leading this movement, will directly benefit from increased visibility, new volunteers, and potential new donors and expanded resources. 
More importantly, the start-up funding you will be providing to launch this movement will serve to leverage additional support from local businesses and the international philanthropic community. 
Risks
  The movement Todos Por La Niñez is happening already. We just need a little bit of help to make it a local and global success. We can't afford not try, we owe to the children who have for too long being neglected and living in the shadows of society. 
The biggest risk is doing nothing to help children reach their full potential.
  Other Ways You Can Help Your financial support will go a long way to help us meet our goals, but we also need your help to spread the word about this movement for children.
Please follow our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/alianzaunidosbolivia to learn about volunteer opportunities and other ways to get involved.
Watch the news about the launch of the movement

<div><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Diagnosing autism as soon as possible gives families some answers they are seeking to their questions about their children’s atypical development. This allows them to begin the process of learning about autism, understanding its effects on their child, and beginning the process of perceiving the future differently.  It allows families to replace worry and fantasy with solid information about the nature of their child’s challenges.  For many families, receiving a diagnosis allows them to move from unfocused worry to mobilized efforts to learn about the disorder, to find help for their child, and to move into some action plan; such mobilization is often a source of relief from some of the anxiety parents experience as they move through the diagnostic process.</span><br/>
</div>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Who We Are</h2> <p>LifeSpan is a team of committed, like-minded people that came together to address a currently unmet need.

<div>We are developing a new technology to address the clinical need of an objective and economical tool for early identification of neurodevelopmental disorders in children.

</div>
<div>
<span>The
current prototype is used to measure pupillary light reflex  in infants and young
children that does not require restraint or headgear. It can remotely and effectively measure PLR in children within seconds
without the child even being aware that a test is occurring. </span><br/>

<h2>
<br/>What You Are Impacting</h2> <p></p>
<p>In the United States,
about 13% of children 3 to 17 years of age have a developmental or behavioral
disability such as autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder. <span> In
addition, many children have delays in language or other areas that can affect
school readiness. However, fewer than half of children with developmental
delays are identified before starting school, by which time significant
delays already might have occurred and opportunities for treatment might have
been missed.</span></p>
<p><span>Your contribution will directly impact the ability for children to be effectively assessed at an earlier age, enabling them to receive intervention earlier. We all want them to grow up in a nurturing, inclusive environment and not set apart. </span></p>
<p><span>Remember:</span></p>

</div></div>","Autism Detection in Early Childhood


Diagnosing autism as soon as possible gives families some answers they are seeking to their questions about their children’s atypical development. This allows them to begin the process of learning about autism, understanding its effects on their child, and beginning the process of perceiving the future differently.  It allows families to replace worry and fantasy with solid information about the nature of their child’s challenges.  For many families, receiving a diagnosis allows them to move from unfocused worry to mobilized efforts to learn about the disorder, to find help for their child, and to move into some action plan; such mobilization is often a source of relief from some of the anxiety parents experience as they move through the diagnostic process.

Who We Are LifeSpan is a team of committed, like-minded people that came together to address a currently unmet need. As parents, grandparents and family members of children and individuals that are challenged by these neurodevelopmental conditions, we can identify with the struggles that are associated with Autism and its associated disorders. 
Our start-up company is comprised of technology and domain professionals that have committed our time and personal resources in addressing these challenges through innovative technologies.


What We Are Doing Now
We are developing a new technology to address the clinical need of an objective and economical tool for early identification of neurodevelopmental disorders in children. Pupillary light reflex (PLR) is a simple functional neurological test that measures the pupil size changes in response to a short light flash, and is significantly different between typically and atypically-developing children. 


The
current prototype is used to measure pupillary light reflex  in infants and young
children that does not require restraint or headgear. It can remotely and effectively measure PLR in children within seconds
without the child even being aware that a test is occurring. 







What We Need and Why We Need It This funding will allow us continue the current studies with The Thompson Center for Autism and Neurodevelopmental Disorders, and conduct beta testing with partners such as The Bridge of Georgia, Emory Autism Center, Marcus Autism Center (Atlanta),  and the National Institute for Brain and Rehabilitation Sciences (Israel).





The Use of Funds are as follows:



Continue with current study on 2-6 year olds
Begin study on infants and toddlers 4-18 month olds
Development of next-generation PLR device on mobile platform










What You Are Impacting 
In the United States,
about 13% of children 3 to 17 years of age have a developmental or behavioral
disability such as autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder.  In
addition, many children have delays in language or other areas that can affect
school readiness. However, fewer than half of children with developmental
delays are identified before starting school, by which time significant
delays already might have occurred and opportunities for treatment might have
been missed.
Your contribution will directly impact the ability for children to be effectively assessed at an earlier age, enabling them to receive intervention earlier. We all want them to grow up in a nurturing, inclusive environment and not set apart. 
Remember:
Earlier Detection = Earlier Interventions = Better Outcomes

</div>We are Sandra and Amanda, two sisters who grew up in the suburbs of Atlanta, Ga. When we started down the path of seeking out the most nutritious foods possible for our growing families, we found out that good eggs and meat are hard to find. We came to the conclusion that if we wanted free-range, soy-free, GMO-free eggs and chicken, we would have to raise it ourselves. <br/><br/>After a few years of keeping backyard chickens within the city limits and volunteering at other people's farms, we decided it was time to move to the country and get our own farm. Amanda and her husband now have 3 acres of beautiful land in Ball Ground, Ga with plenty of space to grow our own food. But why stop there? We want to share our passion for healthy food with the rest of our family and friends.<div><br/></div><div>

</div>Hens don't start laying eggs until they’re around 4 to 6 months old, so it takes a bit of an investment to get a new flock started. We have to build their coop, buy chicks, and feed them for at least 4 months before we will see our first egg. That is why we are asking for your help. By contributing to this campaign and choosing one of the egg perks, you are essentially pre-ordering your eggs. The more eggs you pre-order, the more money you save per dozen. We get the money up front, when we need it most, and you get a steady supply of fresh eggs once the hens start laying. This type of arrangement is often called Community Supported Agriculture, or CSA.<br/><br/>We plan to have the chicks delivered at the end of March 2015 and expect to see our first eggs in August. Once their egg production is steady, around mid to late September 2015, we will notify you that you can begin picking up your eggs. All eggs must be picked up at the farm in Ball Ground or, with notice, we can make arrangements for you to pick up from Sandra's house in Roswell, Ga. <br/><br/>Other perks include classes on how to dress a chicken, how to cook a chicken, and general homesteading. We love what we do and love to share our knowledge and experience with like-minded folks. Each of these classes will be a private two hour session at the farm with Sandra and Amanda. You are welcome to bring anyone with you that you would like to share the class with.<br/><br/><p></p>

</div> <div> <h3>Why Our Eggs Are Different<br/>
</h3>
<p>
Just
about every grocery store now has organic, cage-free, or at least
""natural"" eggs. Some even say free-range on the label.
While all of that sounds nice, they are not telling you the whole
story. Most of those chickens will never see sunshine or a blade of
grass in their lifetime. You can get truly free-range eggs at the
farmers' market, but what type of grain are they supplementing with?
GMO corn and soy?</p>
<p>
All of our laying hens and meat chickens will be raised on pasture with
24/7 access to grass and bugs - a chicken’s natural diet. We will
supplement with grain but only soy-free, certified non-GMO grains,
and organic when possible. You will see the difference in their
yolks. Eggs from free ranging chickens have dark orange yolks
indicating high levels of Vitamin A and Omega-3s.</p>

<br/>To keep things interesting we have chosen to raise a breed of chickens
that lay colored eggs. Eggs come in more colors than just white and
brown. They can be blue, green, or even pink. It is exciting to open
a carton of eggs and see a whole rainbow of colors!<br/><br/><p></p>

<p><br/></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges<br/>
</h3>Of course, with any type of farming there are always risks involved. Predators, illness, and extreme weather are common concerns. We take great care to protect all of our animals to the best of our ability. We have an electric fence and a livestock guardian dog around to scare off predators and alert us of any disturbances. Well nourished birds with plenty of space to wander generally don't have many health concerns, and we will quarantine any new animals for an appropriate amount of time to prevent the introduction of illness. There is not much we can do about the weather. Fortunately, heritage breed chickens are pretty well adapted for cold weather, and their coop will be well insulated.<br/><br/>

When we met in Prague and realised what a great place it is, we came up with the idea that MORE people could come and stay if it wasn’t for the accommodation costs. We realised when people join forces around a common goal, anything can be possible. Our idea provides a better and more affordable way for people to stay when travelling and it can help and change the lives of the community that    support it. 
That’s why we started this campaign in order to revolutionize accommodation and make this idea grow. The revolution is determined by YOU, and YOU can be a part of it, by supporting us. And this is just the beginning.

We are creating a community of people with the same love for travel and believes that we can break the mould of the traditional accommodation structures. 


Our mission is to raise USD$1,000,000 (or more) and secure a centrally located apartment block in Prague, renovate it to a good standard and manage it. Part of the building would be rented out long term, which essentially pays for your stay and any running costs to the business. 
More people join, the bigger and better advantages they get. 


What You Get



Whether you’re a tourist, back-packer, job hunter, student, family, business traveler or seasoned traveler, there’s one thing that we’re sure you’d agree on...the rewards OUT-WEIGH the donation.
For example $15 donation would get you 3 nights, $25 donations 6 nights and $100 will give you an incredible 30 nights stay in Prague. 






Spend less and have more fun 

 If you spend less on accommodation then you would have a LOT more money in your pocket for other things... 
Have some fun working out what you can save.



Think you won't use the reward but still like the idea


We understand, it might not be for everyone, You might be terrified of history and culture or have an allergic reaction to beautiful cities, or simply don’t appreciate gorgeous women or tasty beer. That’s OK because you can still donate for someone else with a REWARD VOUCHER...perfect for Christmas presents, staff or client gifts, birthdays or even Tuesdays.
Other Ways You Can Help There is more than one way you can contribute to our campaign and help us reach our goal. Sharing this campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media outlets is equally as valuable to us. We would like to thank you in advance for you contributions and continuing support.

What if we don't reach the entire goal 
Because we are already in the accommodation business we're confident we can still reward all our donors as promised. We're not going to give up that easy. We've started the revolution and we aim to make it happen one way or another.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The first memory of my childhood was formed when I was under the age of four. I remember so clearly my father’s friend. They are amazing musicians and liked to spend time performing live. I recall on one particular night a babysitter was called in to watch over the 5 children (my oldest sister, my older twin brothers, myself, and her toddler). We played together, racing through the house, playing tag and hide-and-go-seek. The house seemed so big to us, and endless number of hiding places we could jump out from and scare each other. When it was time to settle down, we all changed into our pyjamas, gathered in the living room, and watched a movie (there may have been popcorn, my intuition says there was). The movie? That detail has always eluded me.</p>
<p>I remember my pyjamas like it was yesterday. I was wearing a nightgown that was white with blue flowers. This was my favourite nightgown, handed down to me by my older sister whom I adored.</p>
<p>Once it was time to go to bed, my twin brothers were sent to sleep in the same room as the toddler, my sister was sent to sleep in the grown-ups’ room, and I was made to sleep in the living room. I fell asleep pretty quickly after a long day of running and playing. I was woken up out of a deep sleep. My intuition told me to keep my eyes closed and to continue to pretend to sleep. I don’t know why I listened, but in hindsight am I glad I did. A few moments later I realized I was not alone in the dark.</p>
<p>I have come to realize that as a small child I made a choice that day. A choice that would signal survival for the rest of my life. Further, every decision I made from that day on would be orbiting around this pivotal moment in time. These decisions would continue to reaffirm day after day that I was unworthy. My voice was lost for 25 years. </p>
<p>Throughout my life I have chosen that I am not worth admiration, self respect, or love.</p>
<p>With the help, love, and patience of those around me and myself, I have chosen to create a new meaning in my life: I am worthy. I have chosen to lead my destiny with the honesty and intent of what I will create.</p>
<p>I am worthy to be who I am, to continue to grow and discover, of risk. I am worthy of love.</p>
<p>I am reaching out to those in my life, my community, and the world to support me in my journey of self discovery, to affirm all the positive love, spirituality, and healthy support I can provide those around me.</p>
<h2><strong>What this will give</strong></h2>
<p>The funds raised will go to the next step of my growth in mental, spiritual, emotional, and physical health. I will be attending a 7 day retreat in which I will continue to create and expand on “I am worthy,” and will support me in conquering my fears, and to live every day as though it is the first and last day of my life.</p>
<h2><strong>How I will give back</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>For every $25 raised, I will knit a 5"" x 5"" square that will be used to create blankets for the Calgary Drop-In Center within 12 months.</li>
<li>As no additional funds are needed or required, any amounts above and beyond my goal saved or donated (whether using this vehicle or another) will be donated to the Calgary Drop-In Center.</li>
</ul><p>Together, we can change the world one person at a time. One beautiful, perfect, imaginative, compassionate mind at a time.</p>
<h3>I have woken up. AND I AM EXCITED!</h3>
<p><em>If you are interested in hearing about or receiving updates on my journey of discovering “I am worthy,” or would like information on how you too can embark on a journey of your own, please do not hesitate to contact me. I choose to be a bottomless well of support for those that choose to use it. Simply leave a comment with your e-mail address (you may choose to keep this comment private).</em></p></div>","My Story...

I will be attending a 7 day retreat in which I will continue to create and expand on “I am worthy,” and will support me in conquering my fears, and to live every day as though it is the first and last day of my life.
How I will give back

For every $25 raised, I will knit a 5"" x 5"" square that will be used to create blankets for the Calgary Drop-In Center within 12 months.
As no additional funds are needed or required, any amounts above and beyond my goal saved or donated (whether using this vehicle or another) will be donated to the Calgary Drop-In Center.
Together, we can change the world one person at a time. One beautiful, perfect, imaginative, compassionate mind at a time.
I have woken up. AND I AM EXCITED!
If you are interested in hearing about or receiving updates on my journey of discovering “I am worthy,” or would like information on how you too can embark on a journey of your own, please do not hesitate to contact me. I choose to be a bottomless well of support for those that choose to use it. Simply leave a comment with your e-mail address (you may choose to keep this comment private).",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey, my name is Carl (from Austin/San Antonio Tx). Like many of you, I saw the youtube video of the treatment of these 2 employees of Dunkin Donuts by TaylorC, and I was horrified. More than horrifed, I was disgusted and outraged. And I can't believe they kept it together, so well. Most of us have had to deal with a difficult customer at one point in our career, but I'd say most peoples breaking points would have been reached by this.<br/><br/>I commend their cool, level heads. It takes some serious composure to stay cool under such a constant, beligerent attack. And to endure the most hateful of racial insults (starting at 6:50m in the video)...<br/><br/>I read that Abid is 18, recently graduated, and has aspirations of being a doctor. I haven't seen what Nithi's aspirations are, but I wanted to counterract this swarm of negativity that happened to these these two, by giving them a foot up in pursuit of their education and careers.</p>
<p>Disclaimer : I dont know either of these two. I havent left Texas in years, but I saw a chance to some really bad nasty bitter lemons into lemonade, and I'm hoping that enough people will support this endeavor.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Im trying to raise a minimum of $10,000, to be split equally between the Dunkin Donuts employees Abid and Nithi. These funds will go towards their educational aspirations. This is a flexible funding campaign, so I elected for all of it to go to them regardless of amount raised (but a lesser %age is collected by IndieGogo if we meet this goal).</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Nasty, bitter attacks from people like the woman in this video, can help jade people to the world around us and make us bitter.<br/>I don't mean to sound completely CareBears over here, but we can counterract this poison by putting forth good deeds, righting some wrongs, and performing acts of random kindness. Any amount will help. $3, $5, $10, $20, $50 (+ a random act of kindness).</p>
<p>Please consider making a donation and pledging a random act of kindness to someone, somewhere. Note this on Twitter with hashtags #payitforward or #randomactofkindness</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If times are tough, you can still help. This campaign needs you to spread the word. Please tell your friends, your fb list, your Twitter feed, instagram hashtag #payitforward or #randomactofkindness with this address. Spread the good word. </p>
</div>
<p>Thank you, and be excellent to each other.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How They're Going to Get the Money</h3>
<p>I wanted this to be a surprise. Rest assured, as the listed beneficiaries, Indiegogo will not release to anyone but them, and will verify their identifications. Basically, I was wanting to hit the goal first, then give them a call (or have a nearby local FL friend of mine go by and notify them) and let them know about the fundraising efforts. Please, please, lets keep this a surprise if possible (although that may not be at this point). </p></div>","Short Summary

Along the way, Brenda was struck by the fact that there were virtually no food options that were kosher and gluten-free. Rather than complain about it, Brenda conceptualized an array of products. Shelf stable prepared meals, desserts, wine and of course, energy bars. By the following spring, we had developed the first version of our products and we were selling out at every farmer’s market that we attended! Along the way, we listened intently to feedback from our customers. By doing so, we realized that the vegan and lactose intolerant markets were also very much neglected.</p><p>As we proceeded with our passion and began testing our products we quickly accomplished some remarkable feats, we were recognized at Kosher Fest and written up in several prominent publications such as the Huffington Post. Since that time we have been testing and preparing for the launch of our energy bars. </p><p>We have been able to perfect three special bar flavors: </p><p></p><ul>

Skinny Kosher Creations has taken this idea and has developed its first phase of products focused on energy bars.  Based in Los Angeles, California, Skinny Kosher Creations has invested the past years developing some incredible kosher-friendly food products.  We have been self-funded until now, but do require a little assistance at this time get our product out into the marketplace. Please consider assisting us with the launching of this wonderful ""passion"".How it Began:Several years ago, our company president, Brenda Laredo and her family were driving to Disney World. Along the way, Brenda was struck by the fact that there were virtually no food options that were kosher and gluten-free. Rather than complain about it, Brenda conceptualized an array of products. Shelf stable prepared meals, desserts, wine and of course, energy bars. By the following spring, we had developed the first version of our products and we were selling out at every farmer’s market that we attended! Along the way, we listened intently to feedback from our customers. By doing so, we realized that the vegan and lactose intolerant markets were also very much neglected.As we proceeded with our passion and began testing our products we quickly accomplished some remarkable feats, we were recognized at Kosher Fest and written up in several prominent publications such as the Huffington Post. Since that time we have been testing and preparing for the launch of our energy bars. We have been able to perfect three special bar flavors: 

Choco Chip Coco'Tini


Choco Chip Mint'Tini


Choco Chip Orange'Tini

Our bars are Nut, Gluten and Dairy Free, Kosher certified and appealing packaging.  The best of all is that they are only 130 calories each.

<p>Nikki is a 25 year old homeless girl who gave birth 2 weeks ago to a little boy, Daniel. He was in the NICU for 10 days with a spinal infection. She was released back to the streets two days after giving birth. She went back to the hospital everyday to be with Daniel and to breastfeed him. Yesterday he was taken by child services before she was even able to say goodbye. Now she has the long struggle ahead of trying to get a home and her life on track.</p>
<p>The sad story with Daniel aside, Nikki has been back on the streets now for over a week since giving birth without access to a bed, shower or clean clothes. Those of you who have given birth can imagine what that must be like!</p>

<p><i><b>*rolét contains no electronics - it is not an e-cigarette.</b></i><br/></p>
<p>Engineered with precision, the rolét™ is a premium device for the casual smoker. Social like a hookah and pocketable like a cigar, it was designed to embrace the organic camaraderie that smoking creates between friends and strangers alike. Whether it's sharing a smoke on the ski lift with a stranger or at a music festival with friends, the rolét is all about portability, sharing, and convenience!</p>

<p></p>
<p>rolét's design was originally conceived and fabricated as a single cylindrical device with three exposed channels and three corresponding carb holes. After completing this prototype and testing it out with friends, a number of areas for improvement were identified. Some of the key brainstorming insights were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users had difficulty aligning the flame with the targeted chamber.</li>
<li>The flame often burned chambers that weren't being targeted.</li>
<li>Multiple exposed holes interfered with the devices per use efficacy.</li>
<li>The device lost aesthetic appeal once a chamber was burned.</li>
</ul>
<h1>
<br/>Prototype 2</h1>

<p></p>
<p>Early design and engineering refinements produced the above prototype which aimed to address the user concerns and insights mentioned above. The solution for the majority of concerns, was a cylindrical sleeve which reduced usage to one chamber / carb hole connection at a time, made the device more air tight, and maintained a clean appearance between the device's three chamber usage cycle.</p>
<p>New insights for improvement identified in this prototyping round:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a secure fit between the sleeve and main device.</li>
<li>Create a tactile indexing mechanism to improve communication of the three chamber rotation.</li>
<li>Create a flush and integrated appearance at the connection point.</li>
<li>Additional engineering refinements to the internal geometry of the device for improved reliability.</li>
</ul>

<p>Updated refinements produced the above looks-like works-like prototype. You'll notice the stainless steel ball plunger in the second picture which is one of my favorite features of the device. Not only does the ball plunger create a smooth and secure fit + rotation mechanism, but it aligns nicely with the device's overall design simplicity. It also provides the user with a wonderful tactile mechanism for more intuitive use. This is the prototype that was used in the rolét video, and it's currently being tested for life cycle failures.</p>
<p>Overall, I'm very pleased with where development stands to date, and I will have a new production sample prototype to show off very soon.</p>

<p>Explained in more detail, instead of inhaling the smoke directly from the chamber at burning temperature like you would with a normal pipe, the combination of rolét’s aluminum material and geometry create a highly efficient heat transfer through a thermal engineering principle commonly referred to as a heat sink. As smoke flows along the length of the rolét smoke channels, the heat transfers into the alloy walls of the device dissipating the heat to a near-ambient inhalation temperature. This is the same method commonly used in cooling high-performance computer chips.</p>

Engineered with precision, the rolét™ is a premium device for the casual smoker. Social like a hookah and pocketable like a cigar, it was designed to embrace the organic camaraderie that smoking creates between friends and strangers alike. Whether it's sharing a smoke on the ski lift with a stranger or at a music festival with friends, the rolét is all about portability, sharing, and convenience!
HOW TO USE IT



1. Load the three chambers with loose-leaf.2. Slide the sleeve over the main device to a secure fit.3. Light the exposed chamber with a basic lighter or match then smoke.



Prototype 1



rolét's design was originally conceived and fabricated as a single cylindrical device with three exposed channels and three corresponding carb holes. After completing this prototype and testing it out with friends, a number of areas for improvement were identified. Some of the key brainstorming insights were:

Users had difficulty aligning the flame with the targeted chamber.
The flame often burned chambers that weren't being targeted.
Multiple exposed holes interfered with the devices per use efficacy.
The device lost aesthetic appeal once a chamber was burned.


Prototype 2



Early design and engineering refinements produced the above prototype which aimed to address the user concerns and insights mentioned above. The solution for the majority of concerns, was a cylindrical sleeve which reduced usage to one chamber / carb hole connection at a time, made the device more air tight, and maintained a clean appearance between the device's three chamber usage cycle.
New insights for improvement identified in this prototyping round:

Create a secure fit between the sleeve and main device.
Create a tactile indexing mechanism to improve communication of the three chamber rotation.
Create a flush and integrated appearance at the connection point.
Additional engineering refinements to the internal geometry of the device for improved reliability.


Prototype 3




*Prototype 3 prior to DLC Surface Finish Test


*Prototype 3 in Black DLC Matte Finish
Updated refinements produced the above looks-like works-like prototype. You'll notice the stainless steel ball plunger in the second picture which is one of my favorite features of the device. Not only does the ball plunger create a smooth and secure fit + rotation mechanism, but it aligns nicely with the device's overall design simplicity. It also provides the user with a wonderful tactile mechanism for more intuitive use. This is the prototype that was used in the rolét video, and it's currently being tested for life cycle failures.

What We Need

It takes about $70,000 to buy a fully equipped and stylishly wrapped truck that looks like the one we used on the show, and is in reasonable condition.  The precise truck we had on the show would have cost over $100,000, but we aren't asking for that! 
It would be wise to start with $10,000 in reserves to pay salaries, buy equipment and supplies, and deal with permits and legal fees.  
That means we need $80,000 to get this off the ground!  
Through a lot of hard work and perseverance, the most I could get a bank to lend us this early in the process was $30,000.    
That leaves $50,000 needed! 


GOAL --------------------> $30,000       If we can raise this much I'll figure out the last $20K.  If we cannot reach our goal we will use the money we do raise to make and send the perks we promised, and start to look for private investment to make the truck a reality.


Stretch Goal 1 --------> $50,000        It would be really nice if i didn't have to figure out the last $15K, and we could buy our truck FASTER!


Stretch Goal 2 --------> $80,000       This would allow us to pay back the business loan and start our company debt free.  That would be AMAZING!






THANK YOU!  

Hopefully soon, this will be in your belly!

<p>My name is Stacy Reed. Many of you know me because we are friends, coworkers, classmates, or share community.  This past weekend, my dad was killed in a fatal car accident in his home state of Texas.  I have no words to describe how profoundly his unexpected death has shaken my world.  On top of the crushing grief, my family and I now have the responsibility of dealing with and paying for the funeral and related travel expenses.  </p>
<p><strong>Why I Need Your Help</strong></p>
<p>I need the help of this vast and beautiful community to get myself and my family (including my mom, Beverly Reed, my sister Tracy and my niece Dorian) to my dad and lay him to rest in a way that honors his memory and allows us to grieve his loss together.  My family and I have very limited financial means, and the costs of travel and funeral arrangements are high, which is why I am writing to you all.   </p>
<p><strong>About My Dad and What Your Help Means to Me and My Family</strong></p>
<p>As a child, I saw my dad as the biggest and strongest man on the planet.  Not merely  a superman, but a real force of nature.  He did my hair and made sure I was neatly dressed and well mannered.  He taught me how to fish and my sister Tracy how to ride a bike.  When Tracy was afraid after he took off the training wheels, he ran behind her with his hand on the back of the bike until he was out of breathe.  </p>
<p>He was a man that had only an 8th grade education, but managed to do so much with his life. He instilled in me a deep love of learning.  His proudest moment was watching me graduate from college...the first person in the family to do so.  He taught me responsibility, civic duty, and integrity. I miss his quiet strength.  It is so painful to realize that I will never get the chance to speak with him again.</p>
<p>I humbly ask my friends and community to do what you can to help me honor my dad, the man who help to shape and mold me into the person you all know.  My family and I deeply appreciate any amount, no matter how small or large, that you are able to give.</p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","About Me

<p>We are a small VEGAN Tortilla Factory that is family owned and operated. La Tauna tortillas makes the most amazing HEALTHY all Natural tortillas that actually taste like tortillas, with none of the PRESERVATIVES or cardboard taste included! None of the <strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">true tortilla</span></em></strong> flavor was lost with our healthy recipe. The Tortilla (or wrap) has become a worldwide staple, it is much easier to use than bread for on the go meals and its also very convenient for travel or storing.</p>
<p>The flavor is amazing, it’s like being in Mexico at my mother’s house eating freshly made tortillas. We guaranty you will be blown away by the true tortilla texture, aroma and the fact you are eating a healthy tortilla.</p>
<p>Our main mission is to educate consumers that eating healthy plays a big role in our health and it doesn't always mean bad tasting food or inaccessible prices. Our prices are accessible to all incomes but most importantly they are reachable to lower income folks. We find that in our community lower income neighborhoods are the ones with most health and obesity problems and unfortunately all this is typically attributed to our bad eating habits and cultures.</p>
<p>We support various groups around town and one of them is our Community Food bank by donating tortillas for Childcare providers that sign up for nutrition classes for their kids lunch menus. La Tauna also supports local homeless shelters for teens and adults. We are always looking for ways to educate our customers about  the benefits of eating healthy, like teaming up with our farmers markets and using their produce or simply by offering a free vegan bean burrito to the unconvinced about healthy eating.</p>
<p>Our passion started after our now 15 year old son was diagnosed with food sensitivity to prepared foods and preservatives. We decided to change our eating habits. We had to come up with a recipe for tortillas that were not only whole grain but that actually tasted like tortillas ….</p>
<p>Our kids are very involved in their school community with gardens for better lunch menu options and they are passionately advocating for a change in our school menus for nutritious yet delicious food.</p>
<p>After a few months of working with a family recipe for traditional lard tortillas we came up with a winner variation and everybody around us fell in love with it. Our first recipe was our <strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">100% whole wheat w/Olive oil tortilla</span></em></strong> made with whole wheat flour, water, olive oil and sea salt, 4 INGREDIENTS in total. The results were true tortilla flavor with all the health benefits included!!!</p>
<p>We opened our store front in February of 2013 in a challenging neighborhood but have proved to be a good asset to the area. Our customers help us out tremendously and love our low prices, they always refer us out to friends and family but it’s not enough.</p>
<p>We are growing fast and our cash flow is not looking good but we want to keep a GREAT quality product at a reasonable price and be able to not only offer them locally but around the globe. We are very interested in being able to ship our product to our troops, family and friends overseas.</p>
<p>Our old equipment is giving out; we now spend more time making one dozen tortillas than 1 yr ago because of the condition of the equipment. As a result my husband has to take more side jobs every week to make ends meet and not raise our prices to the public.</p>
<p>We take many looses because our product has NO PRESERVATIVES but we refuse to use them and the hot weather in Tucson AZ doesn’t help much. We get many requests for our tortillas via the internet and its becoming a big problem since our tortillas can’t travel safely in regular packaging past 2 days in the summer.</p>
<p>We ship our product all over the states via our website <a href=""http://www.lataunatortillas.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.lataunatortillas.com</a></p>
<p>This is why we are reaching out to you, we need your help. We need a vacuum sealing machine, dough divider/rounder and some work to our delivery/family van.</p>
<p>How will this help:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sealing machine will allow our PRESERVATIVE FREE product to reach anybody in the world without spoiling, like our troops in other countries. </li>
<li>The dough divider/rounder will help us cut down the dough ball making time from 6 hours to 2 hours thus allowing for more work sources to be secured.</li>
<li>Our delivery van is also our family car for now and it takes a daily beating. It needs major service to the transmission and we want to give it a nice presentable paint job to represent La Tauna tortillas everywhere we go.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>To follow is an explanation of the $18,000.00 being raised:</p>

<p>If we don’t reach our goal of $16,749.00 we will use the amounts received towards the down payment of the dough divider/rounder. </p>
<p>If we collect more than what we aimed for the remaining funds will go towards advertising, vacuum seal quality bags and other much needed smaller equipment and off course paying loans.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Because of the positive impact healthy food has made in our family we want to pass that on to our community. We passionately believe what we eat affects not only our health but our state of mind as well. Our tortillas will have a great impact in our community and around the world health wise since they not only taste great but they are very healthy. Now anybody will be able to have access to them. We will be working with various nutritionists in many local Hospitals and clinics for their patient classes for diabetics, heart patients, weight control classes, etc. La Tauna is already looking in to the possibility of providing our tortillas to schools, prisons and retirement homes.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Harriet and I am a filmmaker. For the last few weeks I have been working on a film about seafarers and the life they lead, with the help of Apostleship of the Sea. Through this I was lucky to meet 4 lovely young men who were working in a fishing vessel off the North East Coast.</p>
<p>Despite their hard work, they had not been paid for 3 months and were now struggling to feed their families back home in the Philippines and Indonesia. They were contracted to that vessel so could not get work elsewhere. </p>
<p>They had also been brought onto the vessel with a transit visa which meant they were not permitted to stay on British soil for an extended amount of time. Because the ship owner would not take the vessel out for fishing trips, the guys have had no choice but to spend much of their time on shore.</p>
<p>This week, they have been arrested for visa issues and face imminent deportation. They will have to go back to their families with no money.</p>
<p>So I have started this campaign to see if we can rally around and send these guys home with a bit of money to help feed their wives, children, parents and all the other family members that rely on them. Just until they can get back on their feet and get another contract.</p>
<p>While it is the vessel owner's responsability to pay them, we must not forget how much we rely on seafarers ourselves. We are an island nation, roughly 90% of imports come by sea. Without these men we would not survive. So please spare any cash you have to show your appreciation for their hard work.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The average wage for these men is £500 a month. This may not seem much compared to European standards but it means they can send money home to their families. They have not been paid a penny since March so anything we can send them home with will be a massive help.</p>
<p>At the last update, they were due to be deported on 28th June. It would be fantastic if we could raise as much as possible in the next 7 days so we can send it over to them asap.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I don't think I need to explain to you how important it is that these guys can feed themselves and their families. Through no fault of their own they have been put in an impossible situation. By international sea trade standards they have been <strong>abandoned</strong> by their employer, in a country they have never been before.</p>
<p>They have not asked for this fund-raising campaign, in fact they don't know it is happening. But I think it is time people took more notice of the thousands of men and women who work in dangerous, often underpaid conditions to ensure we have everything we want and need all year round.</p>
<p>So please, forgo that skinny latte and blueberry muffin today and put the money towards directly helping someone in need. Someone like you who has a family and a home but has found themselves in a difficult situation.</p>
<p>You can help them right now.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>We are a pair of Denton residents and rock climbing enthusiasts with a dream of opening our very own bouldering facility for climbers here in the area.</p>
<p>This would be big for Denton.  Currently, participants in this growing sport have limited options: either attend a local university and settle for its limited facilities, or spend lots of extra time and money on gas and do business in another town's economy.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We've nearly finished putting together our vision and making the necessary plans, but we need a little capital to begin building our vision.</p>
<p>Of course, we're not asking for charity here;  If you contribute, you'll receive the bonuses (perks) listed on this page in accordance with the size of your contribution once we open for business.  Think of it as buying your climbing passes a little while in advance, and helping us get started at the same time.</p>
<p>If you want to help our cause, but bouldering isn't your cup of tea, feel free to gift your contribution bonuses to a special Denton-area climber in your life.  (We'll send you a voucher that anyone can redeem.)</p>
</div>
<h3>What If The Goal Isn't Reached?</h3>
<p>Even if our stated goal isn't reached, we're still making this happen, and you will still receive any perks you claimed once the gym opens!</p>
<p>Your contribution will help us get the ball rolling faster, and will help us to convince the right people that climbers in the Denton area are serious about wanting a gym!</p>

About Eddy<br/><br/></b><p>
</p><p>As the 2014 season approaches, Team
Eddy Gonzalez’s Mustang is torn apart due to a cracked engine block and broken
camshaft. Our team needs your support to get Eddy on the track so he can have a
competitive edge in the 2014 season.</p>
<p>As a life-long participant in all
things “motorsports”, Eddy is ready for his next challenge as a drifter. Unlike
other motorsports, this high-skilled, high-powered motor sport where drivers
intentionally maneuver their cars into well executed, controlled sideways
slides at high speeds through a marked course, has professional drivers &amp;
teams competing in a total of seven competitions, while there are dozens of
pro/AM competitions on the West Coast alone. Judged on execution and style,

About Eddy
As the 2014 season approaches, Team
Eddy Gonzalez’s Mustang is torn apart due to a cracked engine block and broken
camshaft. Our team needs your support to get Eddy on the track so he can have a
competitive edge in the 2014 season.
As a life-long participant in all
things “motorsports”, Eddy is ready for his next challenge as a drifter. Unlike
other motorsports, this high-skilled, high-powered motor sport where drivers
intentionally maneuver their cars into well executed, controlled sideways
slides at high speeds through a marked course, has professional drivers &
teams competing in a total of seven competitions, while there are dozens of
pro/AM competitions on the West Coast alone. Judged on execution and style,
rather than who finishes the course in the fastest time, drifting is a crowd
pleaser, and is often compared to the freestyle nature of skateboarding and
motocross. Drifting is the nation's fastest growing motorsport and is second to Nascar in seats sold.

<p>Liberia is recovering from fourteen years of <strong>a brutal civil war</strong> that left <strong>nearly 250,000 people dead</strong>
 and nearly a million displaced. The length, ferocity and indiscriminate
 nature of the conflict left the country’s infrastructure in ruins and 
the war compounded the sufferings of millions of Liberians who, even 
before the war, had <strong>little or no access to basic human needs</strong> such as <strong>safe drinking water</strong> and <strong>sanitation</strong>.</p>
<h2>THE FACTS</h2>
<p>The current WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) environment in 
Liberia looks catastrophic. Out of a total population of approximately 
3.5 million:</p>
<ul><li>2.63 million Liberians (75%) drink water of unknown quality</li></ul>
<ul><li>3.01 million (86%) lack access to adequate modern sanitation facilities</li></ul>
<ul><li>Only 5% of the Liberian population practice safe hygiene behavior in
 washing hands after using the toilet or before handling/ eating food</li></ul>
<p>3,000 people die every year due to poor water and sanitation in 
Liberia and 2,600 children under the age of five die every year from 
diarrhea. (WHO/UNICEF)Unsafe water directly affects every area of 
development in Liberia. Children cannot attend school if they are sick 
from dirty water, and adults suffering from water-borne illnesses 
overwhelm hospitals and cannot go to work. Hours spent looking for and 
collecting clean water mean hours not spent adding to a family's 
economic well-being. In short, the best intentioned efforts at 
development fail if the basic necessity of clean water is not met.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.faceafrica.org/wp-content/gallery/williamtown/a2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>WHAT FACE AFRICA DOES</h2>
<p>FACE Africa funds and supports sustainable water, sanitation and 
hygiene projects in rural Liberia. We have a particular interest in 
empowering young girls and women through access to safe water, 
sanitation, and hygiene - giving them the chance to reap the health, 
economic and educational benefits.</p>
<p>We work in the rural part of the country, in areas that are isolated 
and have not been touched by much external support due to distance, bad 
roads, and weak infrastructure.</p>
<p>Our projects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hand Dug Wells and Handpumps</li>
<li>Rehabilitation of Existing Wells</li>
<li>Hygiene and Sanitation Education</li>
<li>Building Communal Latrines</li>
<li>Training Water Committees</li>
</ul>
<p>Since 2009, we have implemented a host of water and sanitation 
projects that have benefited thousands of men, women and children in 
rural Liberia. Our latest initiative known as ‘County by County’ or 
‘CbC’ Commitment will seek to construct 250 wells and hand-pumps in 
River Cess County by 2017. The initiative will provide 100% water 
coverage to the county, benefiting over 60,000 residents.</p>

<h2>THE PROBLEM - WHY WE NEED TO RAISE $5,000</h2>
<p>We work in rural Liberia, in areas that are isolated and have not 
been touched by much external support due to distance, bad roads, and 
weak infrastructure.</p>
<p>RiverCess is one such region. It is the twelfth county established in
 Liberia and one of the country’s most marginalized areas, under-served 
in water and sanitation and least likely to be served through the 
efforts of government and other agencies.</p>
<p>Most households in RiverCess were displaced during the war and most 
residents live in extreme poverty with only 25% of the population having
 access to safe drinking water. The majority of the population in 
RiverCess gets their water from contaminated open creeks and rivers for 
drinking and other household use.</p>
<p>Hand pumps and wells constructed before the war have been mostly 
damaged or are in a state of disrepair. RiverCess has one of the highest
 rates of waterborne diseases among its residents, presenting an urgent 
need for intervention in the WASH sector.</p>
<p>Our goal is to construct 250 clean water access points in River Cess 
County by 2017 and provide 100% water coverage to over 60,000 residents.
 If we can accomplish this, the entire county of RiverCess will have 
access to safe water!</p>
<p>We have already completed 10 projects in RiverCess and have 240 more to go!</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>THE SOLUTION - WE NEED A STRONG, RELIABLE VEHICLE</h2>
<p>RiverCess is about a 3.5 hour drive from Monrovia, the capital of 
Monrovia and getting there is not always easy. FACE Africa is 
desperately in need of a strong, reliable vehicle that will allow us to 
carry on our work in River Cess. Since FACE Africa doesn’t own a car, we
 spend thousands of dollars of our precious funds each year renting 
cars. Putting this money instead toward our work would have huge 
implications for our water projects. This would mean more water access 
points and more people living healthier, more productive lives.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.faceafrica.org/wp-content/uploads/indegogo2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We also have to depend on rental cars that are unreliable and break 
down frequently, sometimes in areas with no cell phone signal or 
communication network. Quite recently our team was involved in an 
accident due to faulty breaks on a rental car.</p>
<p>The roads to our projects in RiverCess make the journey particularly 
tough. With projects taking place in remote locations, the conditions of
 the roads can become dangerous and challenging, particularly during the
 rainy season where you cannot get beyond Monrovia without a 4 x 4.</p>

<p>With the money raised through this campaign, FACE Africa will 
purchase a vehicle that will be instrumental in getting our team to and 
from Monrovia, transporting the necessary materials and equipments 
needed to implement our projects, and taking us to more areas that are 
in need so that we can conduct feasibility studies and assessments. Most
 importantly, having a strong, reliable 4x4 will ensure our team's 
safety and security.</p>
<p>By contributing to the campaign, you will be helping fight the water 
crisis and enabling our team to continue the amazing work they are 
doing. Any amount counts so please consider donating $5, $10, $25, $50, 
$100 or $1,000. Anything you can do is so greatly appreciated!</p>
<h2>HELP US GET THIS VEHICLE!</h2>
<p>In August we raised $5,690 towards our goal and are now launching a 2nd campaign to get us closer to our $15,000 target. With $15,000, we will be able to purchase a truck like the one you see below.</p>
<p>This 4x4 pickup truck will
 allow us to get to the hardest to reach areas in rural Liberia to 
deliver access to clean and safe drinking water to those who need it 
most!</p>

<p>After watching the
movie 'Chocolat' in 2010, we (Carl and Mary Matice) decided to embark on an marital
enriching adventure of making cacao into chocolate. We bought a mexican molcajete
and hand ground our first pound of cacao beans. This single pound of cacao happened
to be of the highest variety, ‘fino de aroma’ as some would call it, amazing us
with its bright, complex flavor notes and smooth, surprisingly unbitter taste.
Since then we’ve been on a passionate pursuit to learn and obtain single origin
chocolates of the highest varieties combined with the purest ingredients and we’ve been telling as many people as
possible about the difference a fine bean can make! </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/185139/files/20131108171413-Stone_Ground_Chocolate.JPG?1383959653"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>In August 2012, we
launched <i>Cao Artisan Chocolate</i> out of
the Lynchburg Community Market. From day one we received overwhelming support
and have grown rapidly, exceeding capacity at every turn. </p>
<p>Now we are launching
our much anticipated factory &amp; lounge, in downtown Lynchburg, Virginia! We
are excited to launch our vision of a chocolate factory based around the purity
of cacao and all other added ingredients. Here consumers can experientially explore
the world of cacao and chocolate: watching the stone grinding of the cacao into
chocolate, learning about the chocolate process, tasting through the world’s
best single origin cacao and experiencing chocolate the way it was intended to
be – with the purity that allows our bodies to thrive with the nutrients from
whole foods (fairly traded and sustainably sourced) without added preservatives,
artificial flavors, un-necessary sweeteners, extenders, fillers, or other ‘junk’.

<h2><b>The Factory Lounge</b></h2>
<p>We create
unique chocolate items out of our bean-to-bar chocolates including single
origin bars, truffles, bark, and tasting guides. Our new location will marry the bliss of our chocolate with
other loves such as single origin coffees, high-grade teas, local vineyard
wines, and locally crafted beers. We will feature chocolate fondue, pastries,
European-style sipping chocolates, gelato, and locally crafted artisan gifts. We
will host tasting events, tours, and classes. We're creating a local avenue for health conscious chocolate and a company that is transparent in our manufacturing and business practices. And you can help us get there!</p>
<p>We are looking to purchase some great seating and furniture to make the lounge really inviting. We are also looking to purchase other furniture, local art and locally roasted single origin coffees. Your support will help launch a unique
and creative business that will assist in the revitalization of downtown Lynchburg, which of course means a few more jobs! </p>
<h2><b>Boost us! </b></h2><p>Reaching

After watching the
movie 'Chocolat' in 2010, we (Carl and Mary Matice) decided to embark on an marital
enriching adventure of making cacao into chocolate. We bought a mexican molcajete
and hand ground our first pound of cacao beans. This single pound of cacao happened
to be of the highest variety, ‘fino de aroma’ as some would call it, amazing us
with its bright, complex flavor notes and smooth, surprisingly unbitter taste.
Since then we’ve been on a passionate pursuit to learn and obtain single origin
chocolates of the highest varieties combined with the purest ingredients and we’ve been telling as many people as
possible about the difference a fine bean can make! In August 2012, we
launched Cao Artisan Chocolate out of
the Lynchburg Community Market. From day one we received overwhelming support
and have grown rapidly, exceeding capacity at every turn. 
Now we are launching
our much anticipated factory & lounge, in downtown Lynchburg, Virginia! We
are excited to launch our vision of a chocolate factory based around the purity
of cacao and all other added ingredients. Here consumers can experientially explore
the world of cacao and chocolate: watching the stone grinding of the cacao into
chocolate, learning about the chocolate process, tasting through the world’s
best single origin cacao and experiencing chocolate the way it was intended to
be – with the purity that allows our bodies to thrive with the nutrients from
whole foods (fairly traded and sustainably sourced) without added preservatives,
artificial flavors, un-necessary sweeteners, extenders, fillers, or other ‘junk’.
 
Want to know more?
Check us out at www.CaoArtisanChocolates.com

The Factory Lounge
We create
unique chocolate items out of our bean-to-bar chocolates including single
origin bars, truffles, bark, and tasting guides. Our new location will marry the bliss of our chocolate with
other loves such as single origin coffees, high-grade teas, local vineyard
wines, and locally crafted beers. We will feature chocolate fondue, pastries,
European-style sipping chocolates, gelato, and locally crafted artisan gifts. We
will host tasting events, tours, and classes. We're creating a local avenue for health conscious chocolate and a company that is transparent in our manufacturing and business practices. And you can help us get there!
We are looking to purchase some great seating and furniture to make the lounge really inviting. We are also looking to purchase other furniture, local art and locally roasted single origin coffees. Your support will help launch a unique
and creative business that will assist in the revitalization of downtown Lynchburg, which of course means a few more jobs! 
Boost us! Reaching
our goal will help us fill the store to completion, but it doesn’t end there! If
we can reach $16,000 we can purchase a 50lb temperer which will boost our chocolate
production by 500%!

<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Storyboard </span></strong></p>
<p>For those who love to spend a lot time in your kitchen to cook or bake, it is still worth of considering your precious time is always well spent. Are you still using the traditional old ways to separating the egg white and yolk? The YOLKTOR team thinks for you and created a lovely UFO-like egg yolk separator – the YOLKTOR!</p>
<p>YOLKTOR is basically a three-quarter round body chamber with an egg yolk holder as its base. On the side of the round chamber, there extends a tube with its separating function to pick up the egg yolk from its whites.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Usage</span></strong></p>
<p>To use it, simply crack one egg on any plate or bowl, give the round body a good squeeze, point right at the egg yolk to suck, then release to empty and store in the base holder.</p>

Storyboard 
For those who love to spend a lot time in your kitchen to cook or bake, it is still worth of considering your precious time is always well spent. Are you still using the traditional old ways to separating the egg white and yolk? The YOLKTOR team thinks for you and created a lovely UFO-like egg yolk separator – the YOLKTOR!
YOLKTOR is basically a three-quarter round body chamber with an egg yolk holder as its base. On the side of the round chamber, there extends a tube with its separating function to pick up the egg yolk from its whites.
Usage
To use it, simply crack one egg on any plate or bowl, give the round body a good squeeze, point right at the egg yolk to suck, then release to empty and store in the base holder.
Then the 2nd egg, 3rd and 4th. Egg whites are now ready for use, 4 at the same time. Isn't it a lot more efficient! At the end of the sucking tube, there is also a small attachment - a tempering brush for use when needed.
Knowing egg yolks being a very common ingredient used for various tempering in cooking and baking, we created the Yolktor chamber to hold up to 4 eggs at a time.

<p>If a small fraction of your holiday spending could help build a business - would you be interested in making that investment? For the past few months I’ve been planning a retail project that I’m very excited about and I’m inviting you to help me launch it this holiday season. I’ve never put out an appeal to friends (and strangers-soon-to-be-friends) to help me fund an entrepreneurial venture before, but this opportunity is too good to pass up.</p>
<p>Laurent et Denis will be a Montreal-based online retailer of jewellery and fashion accessories (that I’ve discovered during hundreds of hours of researching) to fill a gap I see in the marketplace. I feel there is a niche in courting clients who want pieces with retro, urban and vintage flair who feel underserved by national accessory chains and who aren’t interested in paying the high prices associated with boutiques and higher-end chain stores. In my own personal style, I take a lot of influence from destinations and, as the branding suggests, I’m drawing a lot of inspiration from the bold and colourful Plateau Mont-Royal, one of the most unique neighbourhoods in one of the world’s most fashion-forward cities. Laurent et Denis plans to initially offer approximately 150 different items (to start) covering categories such as earrings, necklaces, bracelets and rings as well as select fashion accessories and handbags.</p>
<p>Laurent et Denis will feature two premium collections showcasing materials such as natural coral, turquoise and jade as well as freshwater pearls, sterling silver and semi-precious stones. Most items in the Laurent et Denis general jewellery collection will retail for less than $15.00 and most premium items will retail for less than $25.00.</p>
<p>As you may (or may not) know, my passion for retailing runs deep. What I bring to Laurent et Denis is a wealth of knowledge acquired from working in specialty retail (including for two major chains) and from running my own pop-up retail ventures. I’ve had a difficult year of employment that has made me ask a lot of questions about who I am and where I am going. At heart, I’m an entrepreneur and a retailer and the future I want to create has me in the driver’s seat. I’m hoping you’ll join this campaign as a passenger as I start this new adventure.</p>
<p><strong>What Laurent et Denis Needs and What You Get</strong></p>
<p>The three key tasks that Laurent et Denis needs to complete to launch are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Registering the business through appropriate channels</li>
<li>Setting up our website (using a Shopify account)</li>
<li>Purchasing opening inventory</li>
</ul><p>Of all the upfront costs, the largest one is opening inventory and naturally this is where the bulk of funds will be allocated. A fraction of funding will be retained as free cash to be used for business purposes. No funds raised from this Indiegogo campaign will be used outside of Laurent et Denis.</p>
<p>I’m excited to offer valuable perks at four different levels for contributors starting at only $10.00. A few notes on the perks follow:</p>
<p><strong>Gift Certificates: </strong>There are two types being offered: one for the contributor (a coupon code) and another (a physical certificate) that can be offered as a gift and will be sent to contributors of $25.00 or more along with their premium gift(s). Both contributor and physical gift certificates come with a one-time use free shipping code.</p>
<p><strong>Gift Selection:</strong> You will be able to choose from a list of ten premium items (minimum value: $16.90 each) when I preview the website to contributors in mid-November. The target arrival date for your gifts is December 5<sup>th</sup> – justin time for holiday gift giving.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping of Perks:</strong> Perks will be shipped to you at no cost to Canadian and U.S. addresses. If you reside outside of North America and would like to contribute send me an email and we’ll sort something out.</p>
<p><strong>Coupons:</strong> Contributors at all levels receive four coupons - they cannot be combined. They are as follows: 15% off a future purchase of $20.00 or more, 20% off one premium item, free gift with a $40.00 purchase and $5.00 off a handbag purchase. Further coupon details will be provided to contributors. All coupons expire June 30, 2013.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>By helping contribute to the startup of Laurent et Denis you are helping me make the leap from retail sales associate to retail entrepreneur with all of the opportunities for growth that come with it. Recently my career has lacked both the financial and growth opportunities that I need and I know that by investing the time and energy into my own business that I will be able to start designing a better life for myself. If you’re willing to offer your support now, I assure you that your help won’t be in vain. I believe there are a lot of opportunities for growth in 2013 which is why I want to get started a.s.a.p. so I can be ready to take advantage of them.</p>
<p><strong>Questions?</strong></p>
<p>Get in touch with me at <a href=""mailto:laurentetdenis@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">laurentetdenis@gmail.com</a> and I will be happy to answer them for you.</p>
<p><strong>Help Me Spread the Word</strong></p>
<p>If you are unable to contribute financially to the launch of Laurent et Denis, don't despair. By spreading word about this Indiegogo campaign via social media and word of mouth you will be of great assistance. In addition, once we launch you can show support by liking our Facebook page and by patronizing our business this holiday season and beyond.</p>

Our candles are hand made in the shapes of cupcakes, pies, lattes, ice cream and more. </p>

</h3>
<p>We are ready to grow again and we need your help!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We've outgrown our little kitchen and our restaurant is bursting at the seams. With no room to expand around us, our goal is to open a full commercial kitchen across from our current location, which will serve as our prep kitchen. This prep kitchen will give us the space we need to run a pre-vocational training facility and provide employment opportunities to up to forty more adults with developmental disabilities. </p>
<p> With your help we need to raise $45,000 to build this commercial kitchen and to fill it with the right equipment. Any money that we raise over our goal will go towards buying a professional canner for our jam production.  </p>
<p><i>Your donations will help provide meaningful employment for adults with developmental disabilities. Too many adults with developmental disabilities are never given the opportunity to say,""I have a job!"" Help us change lives through meaningful employment!</i></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The most important aspect of this new kitchen will be the people and the lives it helps to change. Having employment is so important to each and every person. For those of you who have a child who is disabled, or an uncle, or a cousin, or a friend, or a neighbor or even if you are disabled yourself, you know directly how one simple sentence,""I have a job,"" changes a life forever. Help us make pay day a possibility for many adults who are never given this chance. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p><b>Please Please spread the word about this campaign!!!!!</b> </p>
<p>We need your help to get the word out. Please consider sharing our campaign in an e-mail, on your facebook pages, on your twitter account and directly with your co-workers, friends, and families. </p>

Steamers Coffee House opened about five years ago with the idea that we could run a normal everyday coffee house that employs adults with developmental disabilities.  We started with eight employees, three of them with developmental disabilities. We now employ over eighty people, forty of them with developmental disabilities. Our coffee house has grown and expanded into a restaurant and bar, and we have our own line of gourmet specialty jams and jellies. 

We are ready to grow again and we need your help!


What We Need
We've outgrown our little kitchen and our restaurant is bursting at the seams. With no room to expand around us, our goal is to open a full commercial kitchen across from our current location, which will serve as our prep kitchen. This prep kitchen will give us the space we need to run a pre-vocational training facility and provide employment opportunities to up to forty more adults with developmental disabilities. 
 With your help we need to raise $45,000 to build this commercial kitchen and to fill it with the right equipment. Any money that we raise over our goal will go towards buying a professional canner for our jam production.  
Your donations will help provide meaningful employment for adults with developmental disabilities. Too many adults with developmental disabilities are never given the opportunity to say,""I have a job!"" Help us change lives through meaningful employment!


The Impact
The most important aspect of this new kitchen will be the people and the lives it helps to change. Having employment is so important to each and every person. For those of you who have a child who is disabled, or an uncle, or a cousin, or a friend, or a neighbor or even if you are disabled yourself, you know directly how one simple sentence,""I have a job,"" changes a life forever. Help us make pay day a possibility for many adults who are never given this chance. 


Other Ways You Can Help
Please Please spread the word about this campaign!!!!! 
We need your help to get the word out. Please consider sharing our campaign in an e-mail, on your facebook pages, on your twitter account and directly with your co-workers, friends, and families.

contextualize doorways to wellness so as to make them tangible and accessible,

based on participant interest. In addition to interviewing people about

techniques that allow people to achieve optimal wellness regardless of their income
level
TRACK OUR JOURNEYWe will use social media and
local arts and crafts festivals to initiate searches for interested participants. People who participate
will complete a person-to-person interview about wellness. Children may also
participate in the study (with parental consent) by illustrating wellness. 

The timeline illustrates
benchmarks for the first two years of the project. The first year (2014) is
dedicated to collecting as much information on wellness as possible, while the
second year (2015) is dedicated to analyzing the information collected and
constructing a Non-profit wellness center. FUNDINGWe are grateful for every
contribution to this project monetary and otherwise. Based on the rules of
Indiegogo we will use the funds raised on this site to pay for project
equipment and transportation. In particular, we plan to travel in a VW Rialta
that will double as lodging and office for the data collection portion of the
project. In 2015, we will sell the Rialta and roll the proceeds into constructing
the wellness center. The other notable funding expense in the chart is
Non-Profit status. Our goal is to create a center that is open to anyone
seeking wellness. Accordingly, we believe a non-profit status will enable us to
reach people at all income levels.WAYS TO PARTICIPATE
In addition to contributing financially, there are several ways to help us contagiously spread wellness:

 Volunteer for an
interview and tell us your story (see website for details)


Invite us to a
festival where we can meet local people that may want to share their stories or
receive demonstration treatments


Help us find
classes (K – 12) that would be interested in illustrating wellness


Follow us on Facebook,
Twitter, and/or blog


Spread the word
about the project to friends, family and colleagues


Shout out a
suggestion! While we are on the road, we will be looking for places to meet the
locals, have coffee, and park the RV. Your recommendations will make the trip a
success!


We appreciate your support
in all shapes and sizes!WHO WE ARE
Tracy Stuardi PhD, LAc.:  Primary Investigator
I have always
been driven by the questions ‘how’ and ‘why’, which has led me to a dual career
path. On one hand, I look for the answers to those questions through research
on chronic disease and complex interventions. On the other hand, I deliver
treatments with an emphasis on quality of life as Chinese medicine
practitioner. The Doorway to Wellness project enables me to use both skill sets
and enjoy one of my favorite hobbies, learning through travel.
Silvia Olvera MAcOM:  Co-investigator
Service has been important in my life, from working
as a photojournalist in the U.S. Coast Guard (1997-2011) to teaching and
coaching in Texas public schools.  In
Dec. 2013, I completed my Master’s in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine and I
am driven to explore health and long-lasting wellness with as many people as
possible along my journey.  Outside the
clinic, I can be found hiking in greenbelts or state parks with my dog Sam. 
Chris Dewey PhD, CPC:  Co-investigatorI am a certified, professional
life-performance, balance, wellness, transition and business coach. I am also a business owner and entrepreneur, published author, award-winning
nature photographer, a forty-year veteran of the martial arts,
a Reiki master, and a retired university professor. I have served as a
member of the Board of Directors for both 501(c)3 corporations and for-profit
corporations.",5.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h4><b>Who
We Are: </b></h4>
<p>FEED Sonoma is a regional food hub. </p>
<p>We aggregate the
freshest produce, eggs, grains, seaweeds and other artisan and specialty crops
from more than 50 chemical-free small farms around Sonoma County.</p>
<p>All our produce is
harvested-to-order. Nothing stays in our warehouse longer than 12 hours.</p>
<p>Twice a week, we
deliver the goods to 60+ restaurants, markets, and caterers in the Bay Area, places like BiRite Market, Good Earth Fairfax, Chez
Panisse, and Foreign Cinema.</p>
<h4><b>What We Need:</b></h4>
<p>We are breaking
sales records every week for the 50+ farms in our network as we race to
keep up with the demand. Some of the farms in our network have tripled and quadrupled sales from working with us.  Our farmers are ready to meet the skyrocketing demand, but
we need to grow our infrastructure to move their goods.</p>
<h3><b>With your support,
we can raise $12,500 for the down payment on a new truck.</b></h3>
<p>Our trucks are the heart of our contribution to
a healthy Bay Area local food system.</p>
<p>The truck moves
the goods, so the farmers can focus on farming. The truck allows us to build relationships
and follow through on our promises. The truck makes the best produce
available to customers and shoppers around the Bay Area.</p>
<p>With a sturdy vehicle fleet, we can get more
food to more customers – including some of your favorite places to shop and
eat.</p>
<h4><b>Why It's
Important:</b></h4>
<p>Plenty of farmers
are committed to growing food in a way that honors the land, the water,
and the people’s health. </p>
<p>Farming without
chemicals, farming that regenerates the soil rather than depletes it,
farming that produces real bounty for the community.</p>
<p>But these
regenerative farmers don’t have a consistent, reliable way to move their goods
in the marketplace.</p>
<p>Farmer’s markets
are important, but not always profitable. And farmers just don’t have the
time or capacity to market and deliver their produce to the local
markets, restaurants, and institutions that really want the goods. </p>
<h3><b>FEED Sonoma delivers the goods so small
family farmers can do what they do best: grow beautiful food that nourishes us all.</b></h3>
<p><b>Our Vision:</b></p>
<p>FEED Sonoma is a values-driven for-profit business. We define profitability in more than just economic terms. </p>
<p>We are dedicated
to creating and maintaining an economic infrastructure to support the small
farms of our community. Our ultimate goal is to create resiliency in our local food system. </p>
<p>We carry out our mission by developing and
maintaining trusting, transparent, and collaborative relationships throughout
the value chain, in order to promote and contribute to a thriving,
community-based, secure local food system.</p>
<p>Anuradha Mittal of the Oakland Institute said,</p>
<blockquote>“The
biggest problem in the U.S. is that food, instead of being about communities,
is now about commodities.”</blockquote>
<p><b>Our farmers, and our customers, are about communities.</b></p>
<p><b>We’re connecting them together, and you can help us strengthen the link.</b></p>
<h4><b>Help us build <i>your</i> local
food system. </b></h4>
<p>Our work rests on
the strength and longevity of our relationships. We exist within and because of
a strong community network – including you. </p>
<p>And as we gather
support from a real community of friends and allies, our goal is to provide
more and more value to that community.</p>
<p>We hope you’ll
join us in this effort, and be a part of our growing web of relations.</p>
<p>Most of all, we
hope you’ll make choices every day to support the health and well-being of your
regional food system.</p>

<br/><p><b>We are located in the historic Union Market district</b>, DC’s wholesaling and manufacturing hub for about a century. The district is a beautifully gritty mix of creative food producers and decades-old family businesses. It’s become DC’s most distinctive neighborhood, and the perfect home for Cotton &amp; Reed.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445885739/yo0hep2kzevigjw4gho3.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><b>What are we distilling?</b></p>
<p>At Cotton &amp; Reed, our spirits are designed to showcase the depth and complexity of our raw ingredients. We are launching with a white rum and a dry spiced rum. People regularly ask us, “why rum?” Well… rum is our favorite spirit, so that was an easy choice. But what makes us really excited about rum is that there are relatively few rum distilleries experimenting with the raw ingredients. By definition, rum is distilled entirely from sugar cane products. The vast majority of the world’s rum is distilled in areas with highly restrictive process requirements. For example, distilleries in Puerto Rico make rum entirely from molasses, while producers in Haiti and Martinique use nothing but fresh pressed cane juice.</p>
<p>We wanted to do something different, so we traveled to lush cane fields, rusty old sugar mills, and giant distilleries in Louisiana and Puerto Rico on the path to finding the perfect ingredients and recipe. We hired <b>Chas Jefferson</b> as head distiller to perfect Cotton &amp; Reed’s own style of naturally complex white rum. The thoughtfully crafted flagship white rum, designed for cocktails, is composed of four distinct cane ingredients sourced from a Louisiana farmer co-op, fermented with Belgian Saison yeast and proofed with meticulously blended mineral water. Each ingredient adds its own flavors and aromas. You’ll quickly taste what’s different about our white rum.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445918796/rqw4k3ofxe1jesprg3yj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>When the time is right, Cotton &amp; Reed will also offer aged rum. The vast majority of rum is aged on American Oak, which contributes notes of vanilla and caramel. Amburana wood from Brazil contributes highly complex notes of spice and honey. Be patient, this will take a couple of years to release.</p>
<p><b>Our equipment.</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Bridgetown Brew Systems has been fabricating custom brew houses in Portland, Oregon since the 80's, and their welds are perfect. When they recently decided to start making stills as well, Cotton &amp; Reed was lucky enough to get the second still to come off their line. It's a custom 500-gallon hybrid still with a six-plate column, a botanical basket, and lots of pretty copper. It’s optimized for rum, though flexible enough to distill brandy, whiskey, and all kinds of other spirits. We added a secondary condenser off the botanical basket to extract concentrated flavors, which we will use to blend our line of cocktail bitters. To ensure that we're optimizing our operation of this fine equipment  and remaining consistent from batch to batch, we hired chemical engineer <b>Dr. Jen Phelps</b>. <br/></p>

<i><br/></i><b>What is the Future of Spirits?</b><p>Craft distilling is starting to boom much like craft beer did in the eighties and nineties. Craft beer now accounts for about 10% of US beer sales, but craft spirits have a lot of catching up to do, contributing only about 1% of spirits sales. We are at the beginning of a logarithmic market growth curve that we expect to last for the next couple of decades.

<p>When Cotton &amp; Reed was conceived, it was

Especially since we are working with the city utility companies to upgrade our water, electrical, and gas. If there are any major new construction costs, then we will need to reallocate funds from the Indiegogo campaign to support other construction costs.

<p>Sideclick uses infrared learning technology to program each button. Programming is as easy as pointing your device's remote at Sideclick and pressing a few buttons. The entire process takes less than a minute.</p>

<h1>About the Creator</h1>
<p>Sideclick was invented and designed by mechanical engineer, Brett Epstein. Brett has always had a passion for product design and has over 10 years of engineering design experience ranging from consumer products to jet engines. Brett's family recently cut the cord, eliminated their cable provider, and purchased a Roku. While Brett loved the device and the sleekness of the remote, he hated the fact that in order to sit down and watch TV, he needed 2 remotes in his hand: one to control the Roku and one to control the volume. After some research, he realized that this basic functionality was lacking in all streaming TV devices and he knew that if he could design something for each of the top selling streaming devices, it would become a must-have accessory for streamers.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>We are aligning ourselves with the best resources and Brett's 10+ years in mechanical engineering have him extremely well equipped for manufacturing sourcing and trouble-shooting. The good news is that this product does not involve any ground breaking technology that you will be waiting around for us to perfect.</p>
<p>We take our schedule commitments very seriously and we have attempted to plan for any contingency, but sometimes problems are unforeseen and out of our control causing delays. We promise you that we will provide excellent communication in the form of updates.</p>

</div>","Why Sideclick?  
None of the popular streaming remotes have the ability to power on and off your TV or control volume. A 2nd or sometimes 3rd remote is always needed.  
Sideclick is a universal remote attachment that snaps onto your streaming remote, allowing you to control the basic functions of your TV and your streaming device all-in-one.
Sideclick is available in black or silver (Apple TV only) and compatible with the following streaming devices:  Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Amazon Fire TV Stick, Google Nexus Player, and Apple TV.


""It's an ingenious idea that solves a very real hassle with using your favorite streaming-media gizmo.  And I want one.  Now.""
Hands on Review
Features


Sideclick can be snapped onto multiple streaming remotes using different adapter clips.  This is beneficial because if you decide to upgrade or change your streaming device, you can still use your Sideclick, you just need a new adapter clip for your new streaming remote.  
Available Adapter Clips
Roku - All 2014 and 2015 Models Supported


Apple TV Second and Third Generations.  
Note - An adapter clip for the New 4th Generation Apple TV will be released later this year.  
Amazon Fire TV and Amazon Fire TV StickGoogle Nexus Player

<p><strong>Hello, my name is Michael Brown, I am 29-years-old and have been a professional chef for 14 years. I am interested in a start-up business, by way of a food truck.  I believe that my small business would be beneficial to  central Arkansas.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This type of business allows me to give back to the community, through better food prices, with the consistency of a seasoned chef, while allowing me more time with my family.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have a beautiful wife, Lauren, and two fantastic children, Aaliyah, 7, and Jayden, 4. I am hardworking, dependable, which is shown in my daily work -- I spend anywhere from 65-75 hours a week perfecting my craft. </strong></p>
<p>My goal is to start a food truck with the name Abstract, <em>An Out of Place to Eat. </em>I will strive for the best food truck in Arkansas, by serving with high-quality food at a low price. This is my lifelong dream and I intend to put my all into it.</p>
<p>The food truck industry is one that is rapidly evolving, has a huge profit margin while allowing an owner to become very close to their customers.</p>
<p>I also plan to use my small business to give back to Glenhaven Youth Ranch, a nonprofit organization that houses troubled youth.</p>
<p>My goal is to raise $25,000 for the business, which would allow me to purchase equipment necessary for me to begin.</p>
<p>Here is the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>$18,00 for the truck</li>
<li>$2,000 for initial food inventory</li>
<li>$2,000 to have the truck wrapped in our company logo</li>
<li>$700 for licensing and permits</li>
<li>$1,300 for initial gas cost</li>
<li>$1,000 for first month’s cushion</li>

<h3>La Aldea El Novillero</h3>
<p>La Aldea el Novillero is a beautiful and peaceful Indigenous village located in the Western Highlands of Guatemala. It has a population of just over 1,600 people.</p>
<p>It is a small Maya K'iche community formed in the late 1950s. The majority of its citizens live in severe poverty.</p>
<p>The community runs a school: Escuela El Novillero, which is in need of some dire love. Last year, a group of 16 Carleton University students installed an all-purpose sports court at the school in one week. This year, a group of 11 individual is returning in hopes of repairing class rooms, teaching English and servicing the community.</p>
<p>The project is being run through an organization called Reto Juvenil Internacional. You can learn more about them here: <a href=""http://www.retojuvenilcr.org/centralamerica-volunteer/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.retojuvenilcr.org/centralamerica-volunteer/</a></p>
<p><strong>What do we need?</strong></p>
<p>We're raising $3000 to cover the cost of materials which will be bought locally and ethically to stimulate their economy. Every cent of the money raised goes directly into the community to buy materials, hire citizens as masons and workers and purchase necessities for the already overpopulated school.</p>
<p><strong>What do you get?</strong></p>
<p>Take a look at a few of our donating perks down below. In addition, we'll give all of our donators access to our blog, which we will be updating daily so you can see how your money is being used and how it's impacting the community.</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact:</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Your contribution will directly impact the lives of 1600 + community members of Aldea El Novillero. </p>
<p>Despite living in extreme poverty, with children often walking over an hour each way to school just for the assurance of a daily meal, everyone in the village is thankful, inviting and friendly.</p>
<p>Last year, our fundraising intiatives help put in a multi-purpose sports court, this year, with your help we can fix broken down classrooms at the local school and ensure more children have access to a fundamental human right: education.</p>
</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Not everyone has the financial ability to donate - and that's okay! We're also collecting school supplies and clothing to bring down to the kids!</p>

The rich and famous, the Pope, missionaries, students, and volunteers enjoy the hammocks made by Tio and company. They appreciate Tio's hammocks not only for their beauty, but for the mission of Tio's businesses: to provide opportunities for marginalized people, usually with physical and mental disabilities, to put their skills to work creating hammocks and waiting tables at Tio's hammock shop and Café de las Sonrisas restaurant.     
Tio's employees work tirelessly to make roughly 5,000 hammocks each year. However, the sales of these hammocks typically happen during Granada's high season, November-April. The rest of the year, May-October, are the thinner months, and without people like us visiting Tio's workshop, income during the low season slows to a standstill. 
                        
To overcome this annual challenge, Tio will launch a gift card project that will allow him to sell products all year long to a worldwide base of customers. Emory University, Rotary International, and other key partners are collaborating with Tio to launch the project in November. This will mark a new chapter for Tio, his family, and his staff. However, that leaves 3 months of the low season and Tio needs capital to cover costs and begin making new products in preparation for his exciting new project.       So, Let's Make a Hammock for Tio Antonio! Together we can stitch a supportive fabric made of social networks and common bonds. Together we can weave donations into the workshop that has changed the lives of hundreds of disabled Nicaraguans. Let's show Tio that his network of support is indeed as strong as his hammocks, and that it is capable of helping him make it through these next few months and launch the gift card campaign. Time is of the essence. Our goal is $20,000. For all he's done to improve the lives of others, it's the least we can do. His network spans the U.S. and the world, making it hard for his supporters to collectively come together in the past. Now is the time. Now is our opportunity to show him how much we care about his life's dedication to those with physical and mental disabilities in Nicaragua. Now is the time to make a hammock for Tio Antonio!",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>In the years since, we've been more than just a bookstore: we've hosted bookmaking sessions with the local primary school, two weddings, three births, three Super 8 Film Festivals, the First and Last Annual International Tzatziki Festival and a host of readings. We've cooked thousands of big dinners and watched thousands of sunsets from our terrace. We've argued about music, art, and literature and, of course, we've danced amongst the books in the nighttime. We've brought hundreds of writers, artists and bibliophiles together from around the world. </p>

<p>Even with these changes and additions, nothing has proven a simple quick fix.

<p> </p>
<p>My name is Grant Reed, and I am running this campaign for my step father Dave. Dave is now seventy, and for the past ten years has been fighting cancer. First it was penile Cancer, and then prostate cancer, and now you name it and he has it. This campaign is not about saving Dave, (as in the end we must all face our own mortality) but is rather about giving back to the man that has given his friends, family, community and everyone he meets, so much.</p>
<p>Dave is one of the kindest, most caring and outgoing individuals I have ever met. I’m not saying this to build the man up, as his actions speak for themselves. In my thirty-seven years of knowing Dave, I have NEVER seen him angry, raise his voice or hand in anger, or begrudge ANYONE. Dave has literally shown me that you can turn the other cheek and be a better man for it.</p>
<p>Dave is the example I strive to emulate (and often fail). When my blood gets boiling over some non-issue, I force myself to ask “How would Dave act in this situation?” A kinder, gentler soul I have yet to meet, and one that has been a guiding light in my life since I was a little boy.</p>
<p>Dave often speaks fondly of the time he traveled to Vegas in 1981. He’ll grin and tell you about the green Monte Carlo he saved up for and took on his trip. The car was his baby and the trip a once in a lifetime journey he has savored for over thirty-two years.</p>
<p>I have now watched Dave suffer for many years. In and out of hospitals, radiation, trips from city to city to see Doctors that could do nothing for him. Throughout it all Dave has kept on fighting with a smile on his face.  He is an amazing man, and a joy to be around.</p>
<p>Throughout his battles, Dave has continued to work at various Jobs. He and his wife Linda maintained and cleaned condos, and Dave works summers at Cottages outside of North Bay Ontario, where he maintains the grounds. (Like many of us, he has many bills to pay and despite his sickness cannot afford to remain idle. Nor do I think he would want to sit at home and waste away. Not while he has the strength to lift a rake.)</p>
<p>I made it home last weekend to visit my mom and her husband, and while there, I went for a walk at the mall next door to their house. Dave called to me as I was going out the driveway and said “I’ll come with you!” We walked around the mall for ten minutes and then Dave surprised me by having to rest on one of the benches for a few minutes. It was then it hit me that he is getting weaker, and despite all my prayers and promises to God, Dave will eventually leave this world and his family behind.</p>
<p>Now as his time draws near its end, the one wish I have for Dave is that I could send him back to Vegas on a surprise trip that would make his heart sing one last time. Unfortunately, I myself work contract to contract and have been out of work for a few months. Then as if from a dream, I sat up in bed this morning and thought to myself, ‘Maybe there is a way I can send Dave on one last dream trip.’</p>
<p>Like Dave, I have not been idle these last few years, and despite the crummy jobs I have been working, I have also managed to finish five novels (my passion in this world.) As of yet I have not found a willing publisher, and if the last fifteen years of efforts have shown me anything, Dave won’t be around long enough to see my dream come true. However, using Lulu.com, I perhaps can make one of his dreams come true (WITH YOUR HELP!)</p>
<p>I propose that you buy a book or two, enjoy a good story and know that you are sending a deserving man on a trip that will fill him with happiness. It will be little compared with the joy and enthusiasm he has brought to others throughout his life, but my hope is that in some small way, it will show him that his life was worth it, and that the happiness you give, will in the end come back to you!</p>
<p>The doctors have told Dave to go home and enjoy his summer as there is nothing more they can do for him. With your help I know we can indeed make that happen. I do not want one penny from this venture for myself. All of the funds you donate will go to the printing and shipping of your chosen books, and the left over money will go straight to Dave for his dream trip.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading Dave’s story. If you can’t help donate, please share this story. If you don’t read books, perhaps you know a young reader that would like my stories and can donate on their behalf. (All of my novels are Teen friendly).</p>

Thank you so much for taking the time to view my indiegogo page. If you have not already watched my video do that first because it sums up all this information pretty well. If you already viewed the video and you are still wanting to know a little bit more, then by all means continue reading :)
 
My name is Derek, and I love baking.
It has always been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember. It's always been one of those things that put me in a good mood. It combined creativity,art, and food which are things that I love to involve myself in. During my time at Baldwin Wallace University, I decided to make the lifestyle change and become a vegetarian, and for me IT WAS HARD. My friends were all vegan and wanted me to take that next step, to become vegan, so I gave it a chance and started with 30 days. We would make our own food and go out to eat, but what I found really disappointing about going out to local restaurants and pubs was that while I could order the black bean burger or french fries, what I couldn't find was a nice slice of chocolate cake, or pie, or ice cream, ANYWHERE. Unless I went to a specialty store or a restaurant solely made to serve the vegan/vegetarian population, finding any desserts were slim to none. 
Soooo..... 
One day I decided to put my love for baking to the test and make a few vegan desserts. I made some chocolate cupcakes and some chocolate chip cookies and found that (not to toot my own horn) they were really really REALLY good. I was running all over the house finding everyone and anyone to try them and they all had the same reaction: ""These are vegan?!?""
SO LONG STORY SHORT I added a minor of entrepreneurship and started running with the idea of creating a vegan bakery. People thought I was crazy for trying this idea out, but just one bite of a chocolate chip scone or a strawberry cupcake and I had them hooked, wanting more. I graduated and saved up some money and registered my future bakery with the state of Ohio.
But I had to give it a name, something that represented what I wanted to bring to the table. I wanted a place that served vegan pastries and desserts and also offered a calm and relaxing environment where people could just come in and forget about their worries for an hour or two...
THEN IT CLICKED!
I decided to call it...
Veg'n Out Cafe (get it???)....
It was a fun little play on words that truly represented what I wanted my bakery to portray. We are an all vegan establishment but we want people to come in and ""Veg Out"" and just relax and have a good time. 
I started sampling my products everywhere I could. I gave them out to people at work, I made birthday cakes for family and friends, I even got the chance to be a part of an event sponsored by the American Heart Association, and recently I was featured on WKYC (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbrcBoDopJs).
People were raving about my cupcakes and cookies and I knew this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.
I was having trouble finding a place of my own to set up shop. I was looking into renting properties, trying to find a commercial kitchen, but was having no luck. I was then told about an opportunity to set up my shop inside a local church in the Berea community. I was so excited! Not only was this place the perfect spot to start my endeavor (right next to the college I attended, great community, surrounded by other great communities) but it had a fully equipped kitchen that they were also agreeing to let me use (cut a lot of the future expenses!!). 
SO FAST FORWARD A COUPLE MONTHS LATER...
I set up a meeting with the city of Berea building department, the State of Ohio Board of Health and a few other head people and had them all look at my potential space and we hit a few obstacles.
NOW THIS IS WHERE YOU ALL COME IN...
We were told that the kitchen and store space were missing a few key items in order for us to start:


we need a three compartment sink in the kitchen for sanitation purposes


we need a grease trap


we need a new ventilation system for the two ovens that they had


we need a hand washing station inside the store area for sanitation purposes

And there were also some construction issues I wanted to address myself:


I wanted to build in a sit in area for people who wanted to stay for a bit


The room needs a fresh coat of paint


Additional shelving is needed to sell merchandise and other packaged products.
 

So this is where all the money raised from this site is going towards. I am hoping to raise and hopefully surpass my goal of $100,000 to make this place something EVERYONE will be talking about regardless if you are a vegan or not.
 
Now your incentives....
Each donation tier gets you a reward whether it be a bracelet, t-shirt, tote bag, some pre made cookie and cake mix for you to make at home, etc., and I hope you take the time to consider donating to my page. 
The higher the amount the better the perk is. I won't go into detail about all of them but I wanted to explain one of the higher perks (because I think it's the best one!)
If you donate $500 or more you get a cupcake named in your honor. BUT THAT'S NOT ALL  you will have a chance to do some extra good with your newly named cupcake! 
Since we are based in a church I wanted to find a way to give back through baking, so I created a program through Veg'n Out Cafe called Cupcake For Charity where through the purchase of your named cupcake a percentage of the proceeds go to a charity of your choice (charity will be agreed upon after the site ends, and percentage of profits go up as the donation increases). It's a great way to donate AND do a little good as well.
 
To sum this all up...
If you made it this far I thank you for taking the time to once again view my page and your consideration in donating to Veg'n Out Cafe.

<p><br/></p>
<p>Thanks for checking out my campaign. My name is Brigitte and I am the owner of Cluckin' Waffle. I've always thought about getting into the restaurant industry but never knew exactly what to do. My parents owned a very successful restaurant  for many years and I loved it.  When I moved to Austin and saw how popular food trucks were, I knew that this was the way to go. I thought that chicken and waffles was a good idea but wanted to put a spin on it. I was on a road trip, my mind just started to wander and it just hit me...Put the chicken and waffles on a stick! After about 4 months of research and finding the equipment I was able to bring my idea to life.</p>
<p>I am currently doing local fairs and festivals under a tent and people LOVE my chicken and waffles. They are always asking if I have a store or food truck/trailer.  I'm ready to take this to the next level and open a food truck/trailer. Food trucks and trailers are very popular in Austin and I know this concept will be very successful.</p>
<p>I have the passion about my food and I know I have something different and special.  Not only do I have chicken and waffles on a stick, I also make fruit covered and candy covered waffles on a stick.</p>
<p>I have a full time job and work hard everyday towards meeting my goal. This campaign is important to me because the donations will help me purchase my trailer in order move the business to the next level. I want Cluckin' Waffle to be my full time career. </p>
<p>I have found the trailer that suits my needs which is alittle over $9,000.00. This campaign will allow me to put down the deposit in order to get the trailer built.  I've already invested  a lot of my own money into purchasing equipment to run my business under a tent. Running my business under the tent is not lucrative but it has helped get my food and business name out there. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>What We Need And What You Get</b><br/></p>
<p>100% of the donations are going towards the purchase of my food trailer. I have to make a deposit of at least   50% of the cost to get the construction started then pay the balance upon delivery. All funds raised are going towards this trailer being made. </p>

THE PROJECT
When we first came to 47 Harrison Street in 2010, it was a vacant lot filled with weeds, sunny-D bottles and blunt wrapper wrappers. When we tested the soil, we found it was contaminated with lead. Providence has tons of vacant lots, but we fell in love with this sunny patch of crabgrass, and moved in with shovels, a broadfork, and many cubic yards of leaves, wood chips, and compost.
Now it is a 5000 square foot urban farm—a hub of food production, beauty, and community education. We built good soil in safe, fertile beds for growing food. We sell food to our neighbors and friends through our CSA, and at the Armory Park farmers market, and also to some of our favorite (the best!) restaurants in the city. We host tours, workshops, and work days with students, naighbors, and other farmers, and talk to people over the fence about the work we do. We're bike farmers, relying on bike carts to do most of the hauling and heavy lifting; we use them to bring produce to market and restaurants, and to divert material from the waste stream through composting and our recycling practices. 
THE PROBLEM
Three years ago when we started Sidewalk Ends, it was with a verbal agreement that we could use the land to start a farm. Though we've been here for three years—and made many attempts to communicate with our landlord—we've never been able to procure a secure lease agreement. He doesn't live in Providence, but we have sent letters, e-mails, and phone calls his way, to no avail. About two years ago, he stopped paying the taxes on 47 Harrison Street.
The present situation is thus:


The city of Providence puts lots up for tax sale a year after the current owner stops paying property taxes. A tax lien gets put on the property, and bidders—many of whom are land speculators—bid on this lien, worth the sum of taxes owed.


47 Harrison Street goes up for tax sale on May 22, 2013. 


We have talked to many people all around Providence about our predicament: city employees, city farmers, lawyers, neighbors, anyone who wants to talk about tax sale. 


We decided: we want to buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


There are people who have experience with the Providence tax sale process ready to bid on the lot on our behalf. 


We need help raising the funds to cover the cost of the lien: $4731.00.

THE SOLUTION
We have spent the past three years building Sidewalk Ends Farm into the beautiful, productive space it is now. Land costs so much in the city, and if we want small agricultural producers to be able to succeed here, we need to create pathways for securing land for farming in cities.

THE PROMISE
We have already poured many hours and dollars into turning this former vacant lot into the verdant farm it is today. For the past three years, our land insecurity has been hanging over us as a concrete reason to invest only in movable infrastructure. We are eager to put down even more lasting roots: rebuild our fence, develop educational programs based in this space, build a farm stand, and continue to develop our soil.

The children and young people in favelas and communities like Mãe Luíza struggle to access quality education, work opportunities and a life free of crime and violence. <br/>To give you an idea of the opportunity gap for those living in favela, the recent Brazilian government census revealed that, ""While 14.7% of the population living in other areas had completed a course of higher education, among those living in favelas and other forms of substandard housing the figure was just 1.6%.""<br/><br/><h2><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; font-size: 15px; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);""><h3>The Impact of Growing Pictures</h3></span></h2><p>The benefits of bringing this project to the young people of Mãe Luíza are to:</p><p>1.

Engage local decision-makers in Natal<br/><span>5. Create a sustainable photovoice project in Mae Luiza and other municipal favelas.</span></span></p><h3><b>International Collaboration &amp; How the Project was created.</b></h3>In 2012, I was lucky enough to go to beautiful north eastern Brazil along with ten other Canadian students where we took part in a Participatory Development field study, which focussed on Favela Upgrading. Visiting more than five communities in metropolitan Natal,  the group of Canadian students not only met community leaders and residents, but also a passionate group of students from the local university UFRN.<br/><br/>One visit made a very strong impression on us, the day we visited Casa Crescer in Mãe Luíza. A community, under immense pressure by real estate developers to relocate many residents, is investing in its future generations at Grow House. As well as culture, sports and regular classes, the centre offers classes in citizenship and social institutions so that the students will be better prepared to participate in the development of their home community. <br/><br/>Following the field study in Natal in 2013, students from Canada &amp; Brazil made a commitment to try and help the young people in this community have a voice and make changes that they are interested in making. Collaborating over the last 12 months, our commitment became stronger and the Growing Pictures project was born. This is why we are asking for your help.<br/><br/><p></p><h3>

Photography is a powerful and empowering tool; it is easily accessible, can be therapeutic and offers another way for individuals to communicate their needs. The best way to help and empower the children and young people of Grow House is by asking the kids themselves - what do they dream of for Mãe Luíza and who do they aspire to become? Through the Growing Pictures project, we will hear their voices and see their realities. What We NeedYour contribution will go towards the following items:

20 disposable cameras


5 point & shoot digital cameras


20 8 GB Flash cards


Gallery website 


Notebooks & Pens


Expenses for 3 Workshops 


Mentor orientation & closing ceremony


Framing for community exhibit

Please check out our perks and help us reach our goal of $1000!Imagine impacting the lives of young people affected by poverty, urban violence and the loss that goes with that, each day facing uncertainty and fearing for their safety. Growing Pictures can grow confidence in young people to allow them to realize the power their voices have.Working with five facilitators, twenty young participants from Mãe Luíza will:1. Learn about photography fundamentals 2. Analyse picture content and technique3. Discuss their photos and experiences4. Select images to be exhibited in their community.Participants will go out into the community and document their daily lives in Mãe Luíza, using some questions to guide their picture content. Questions may include:What is it like to live in Mãe Luíza?What in my community has helped me? What in my community has caused challenges in my life? What do I want to tell other people about living here?How is my life different now that I go to Grow House classes? What is better? What is worse? What are my hopes for the future? And what might help me get there? Grow House & Working with young peopleCasa Crescer or Grow House is a community education extension centre in Mãe Luíza, which provides a venue for young people to take classes, improve literacy, study art, music and also play sports in a safe place. The children and young people in favelas and communities like Mãe Luíza struggle to access quality education, work opportunities and a life free of crime and violence. To give you an idea of the opportunity gap for those living in favela, the recent Brazilian government census revealed that, ""While 14.7% of the population living in other areas had completed a course of higher education, among those living in favelas and other forms of substandard housing the figure was just 1.6%.""The Impact of Growing PicturesThe benefits of bringing this project to the young people of Mãe Luíza are to:1. Increase confidence among participants2 . Increase visual & verbals communication skills of participants3. Teach & improve photograpahy skills among participants4. Engage local decision-makers in Natal5. Create a sustainable photovoice project in Mae Luiza and other municipal favelas.International Collaboration & How the Project was created.In 2012, I was lucky enough to go to beautiful north eastern Brazil along with ten other Canadian students where we took part in a Participatory Development field study, which focussed on Favela Upgrading. Visiting more than five communities in metropolitan Natal,  the group of Canadian students not only met community leaders and residents, but also a passionate group of students from the local university UFRN.One visit made a very strong impression on us, the day we visited Casa Crescer in Mãe Luíza. A community, under immense pressure by real estate developers to relocate many residents, is investing in its future generations at Grow House. As well as culture, sports and regular classes, the centre offers classes in citizenship and social institutions so that the students will be better prepared to participate in the development of their home community. Following the field study in Natal in 2013, students from Canada & Brazil made a commitment to try and help the young people in this community have a voice and make changes that they are interested in making. Collaborating over the last 12 months, our commitment became stronger and the Growing Pictures project was born. This is why we are asking for your help.

<p>There are countless ways to get in shape.  From resistance training at a gym to physically expressing yourself in dance or martial arts and even outdoors experiences such as backpacking or rock climbing.  However, comic book reading, RPG loving, video game connoisseurs have never really had any physical outlet to turn to.  <b>NerdFit </b>is changing that.  We've created workout regimens that work the entire body as well as tap into the inner (and outer) nerd in all of us.  </p>

<p><b>Sword and Shield:  </b></p>
<p>Whether fighting off a horde or orcs or riding to war against a rival hour, a knight must be proficient with a sword in shield in order to leave the battlefield alive.  Likewise, a ranger looks to a blade just as much as wits to survive in the wilderness.  Just as important as blade technique is fitness.  Whether you see yourself as a ranger whose skill with a blade rivals your hunting and tracking prowess or a knight who slashes and smashes through chainmail, armor and shields, strength and muscular endurance are priorities of the highest order.  Get ready to slash, slice, and smash your way through hour and a half training sessions.  You may enter an inexperienced fighter but leave a warrior.  </p>

By doing this we want to make the best coffee available for Laplanders, invest in building up the <a href=""https://www15.uta.fi/FAST/FIN/GEN/to-coffe.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">community</a>.<div>
<br/><div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">As we develop the roastery our hearts have a desire to serve the Northern land in ways that extend beyond coffee. The business, although separate from this vision, will enable us as a family to be released to serve in that area. Namely, our hearts want to care for young women in providing for their yet unborn babies, in cases when an alternative for an abortion could be made a reality.</span></div>
<div>
<div>With ""Lapland Roastery"" running, we can provide financially, give a place to stay and work, help to live through the economic and social pressures and encourage to keep the child. When the child is born a mother is encourage to keep her child. Alternatively, we will work to help find an adopting family. <b>We want an alternative to the interruption of pregnancy become a plausible reality. </b>This can be achieve through counselling, educating, making job placements and financial support available. <br/><p></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: left;"">Beyond the business: offering an alternative to abortions</h3>
<p>The business mission is make the best and freshest coffee available in the area where people love and enjoy coffee very much. With this business we hope to support the community and bring joy to those who love quality coffee. Of course we hope to provide for our living and educational expense, but our hearts want to move beyond the business. We desire to help women to choose to keep their babies when the pregnancy termination can be avoided.</p>
<p>For the reasons we are not aware of, Kemi has one of the highest rates in Finland for pregnancy terminations. In 2008 almost every <a href=""http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/finland/ab-finlandhd2.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">5th pregnancy (18.7%)</a> was aborted in Kemi area, Lapland. If our business allows us to support what our hearts lead us to do, we want to minister to the pregnant women who are considering an abortion.</p>

<p>People of the Northern Scandinavia, and Finns in particular, have a long and rich history of drinking coffee. Today they consume <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_coffee_consumption_per_capita"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"" target=""_blank"">more coffee per person</a> than the people of any other nation. The average Finn drinks more than four cups daily. There's no statistics about Saami but they are likely to drink even more coffee on average. <b>Very few of those who live in Northern Finland and Lapland enjoy the full flavor of freshly roasted coffee.</b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> This is because once coffee beans have been roasted, they quickly begin to lose flavor. Within 12 to 14 days the coffee becomes bland - it is a perishable good. Because of this, our immediate goal is to open the roastery.</span><br/></p>
<br/>Coffee gathers community around it. We would like to help revive the old Finnish tradition of gathering to roast, grind and drink coffee together. Of course not exactly as before, but in keeping with the idea of gathering for fellowship and good coffee.<p></p>

Andrey grew up in a beautiful part of <a href=""https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Irkutsk,+Irkutsk+Oblast,+Russia/@45.7853675,33.7788768,2z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x5da83ad353e2f665:0x31d6cd1456d8e94e"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Eastern Siberia</a>. Christmas 2009, while visiting friends there in a remote village, he met his wonderful wife Rachael. They were married in the summer of 2011 and moved to Northern Finland. There in the city of Oulu Andrey continued to work in information technology and write his PhD thesis at Oulu University Business School. Soon God blessed the family with a precious daughter, Anna Mari, who brought much joy and pleasure in their lives. Shortly prior to Anna's birth, Rebekah, Rachael's sister, had joined the family for her upcoming studies in the international program of nursing at Lapland University of Applied Sciences. The family needed to move another 100 km North to Kemi for the girl<span style=""background-color: initial;"">'s nursing program. This is where they currently live, study and minister, and where in May Rachael and Rebekah successfully completed their first year of study.</span><div>

</div></div>","In briefThe goal is to buy a commercial coffee roaster to develop the existing coffee roastery. By doing this we want to make the best coffee available for Laplanders, invest in building up the community.
As we develop the roastery our hearts have a desire to serve the Northern land in ways that extend beyond coffee. The business, although separate from this vision, will enable us as a family to be released to serve in that area. Namely, our hearts want to care for young women in providing for their yet unborn babies, in cases when an alternative for an abortion could be made a reality.

With ""Lapland Roastery"" running, we can provide financially, give a place to stay and work, help to live through the economic and social pressures and encourage to keep the child. When the child is born a mother is encourage to keep her child. Alternatively, we will work to help find an adopting family. We want an alternative to the interruption of pregnancy become a plausible reality. This can be achieve through counselling, educating, making job placements and financial support available. 


Beyond the business: offering an alternative to abortions
The business mission is make the best and freshest coffee available in the area where people love and enjoy coffee very much. With this business we hope to support the community and bring joy to those who love quality coffee. Of course we hope to provide for our living and educational expense, but our hearts want to move beyond the business. We desire to help women to choose to keep their babies when the pregnancy termination can be avoided.
For the reasons we are not aware of, Kemi has one of the highest rates in Finland for pregnancy terminations. In 2008 almost every 5th pregnancy (18.7%) was aborted in Kemi area, Lapland. If our business allows us to support what our hearts lead us to do, we want to minister to the pregnant women who are considering an abortion.

At this point we focus on coffee roastery and aim to serve the community in Lapland with a quality product. We also make plans for working with the young pregnant women. We want to show care and love to them and their unborn child. 

With the ""Lapland Roastery"" running, we can provide financially, give a place to stay and work, help to live through the economic and social pressures and encourage to keep the child. When the child is born a mother is encourage to keep her child. Alternatively, we will work to help find an adopting family. We want an alternative to the interruption of pregnancy become a plausible reality. This can be achieve through counselling, educating, making job placements and financial support available.

Why Coffee?
People of the Northern Scandinavia, and Finns in particular, have a long and rich history of drinking coffee. Today they consume more coffee per person than the people of any other nation. The average Finn drinks more than four cups daily. There's no statistics about Saami but they are likely to drink even more coffee on average. Very few of those who live in Northern Finland and Lapland enjoy the full flavor of freshly roasted coffee. This is because once coffee beans have been roasted, they quickly begin to lose flavor. Within 12 to 14 days the coffee becomes bland - it is a perishable good. Because of this, our immediate goal is to open the roastery.
Coffee gathers community around it. We would like to help revive the old Finnish tradition of gathering to roast, grind and drink coffee together. Of course not exactly as before, but in keeping with the idea of gathering for fellowship and good coffee.


The team
We are a family of four. Andrey grew up in a beautiful part of Eastern Siberia. Christmas 2009, while visiting friends there in a remote village, he met his wonderful wife Rachael. They were married in the summer of 2011 and moved to Northern Finland.

The family needed to move another 100 km North to Kemi for the girl's nursing program. This is where they currently live, study and minister, and where in May Rachael and Rebekah successfully completed their first year of study.





Almost every morning Andrey walks around the Kemi city center looking at the quiet residential areas, offices and numerous signs for rent and praying that God will bless the northern community. The Northern community is where our hearts are. We desire to see this remote part of Europe revived spiritually, socially and economically. Isaiah 43:19 Coffee will hopefully not only help strengthen the economy, but also contribute to the community on the social level.



What we've already done

1. Experimented with vintage popcorn-makers.2. Invested in a small (210 gram/batch) Fracino Roaster ($2400)3. Purchased a good-size coffee grinder ($1000)4. Stocked up with 92 kg of Guatemalan green coffee beans ($1500)5. Bought kitchen supplies: coffee makers, thermoses, cups, packaging, etc. ($1700)6. Traveled to the location of the first event ($1180)7. Studied for and acquired a Hygiene passport ($660)Before getting the Fracino Roaster we experimented with roasting coffee using vintage popcorn makers.

The videos of us using popcorn-makers are available on YouTube here.





We have invested in a small electric Fracino roaster, ordered larger batches of green coffee and invested in some kitchen supplies, brewing and grinding equipment. At the end of July we provided coffee at an Indigenous people conference in the Northern Norway. We were amazed at how much the participants appreciated the taste of freshly roasted coffee.

d’une centaine d’années et seule fenêtre sur le fleuve du quartier Sainte-Marie,
est l’une des préoccupations majeures des résidents du secteur. Le Comité des
citoyens et citoyennes du parc Bellerive, formé en 2012, souhaite justement faire
de cet espace méconnu des Montréalais un espace public accessible, sécuritaire,
accueillant et constituant un réel accès au fleuve. Or, plusieurs facteurs minent
l’attractivité du parc : lourde circulation de transit sur Notre-Dame, traverse
piétonne désuète, signalisation inadéquate, piste cyclable du côté opposé de la
rue qui n’incite pas les cyclistes à y faire halte, présence de voies ferrées souvent
utilisées comme lieu d’entreposage pour les conteneurs maritimes formant une barrière
au fleuve, bruit intense, etc.</p>

<p>Le Village Éphémère est un concept
fondamentalement participatif, évolutif et à géométrie variable, capable de
s’adapter aux défis de sites complexes (lots vacants, friches, infrastructures,…)
et, comme le démontre la progression des objectifs et de la longitivité de
cette deuxième édition, de tendre au fil des éditions futures, de plus en plus
vers un établissement permanent (marché de noël design, marché aux puces, allée
gastronomique, villages d’artistes,…). Cette année, encore une fois, le Village
Éphémère se révèle être une opportunité de reconnaissance pour les jeunes
designers qui y prendront part, une occasion de se faire connaître de la
population du grand Montréal mais aussi d'ailleurs, de tisser des liens avec ses pairs et de prouver
son appartenance à sa communauté, un souci de son environnement urbain et d’une
sensibilité sociale.</p>

somme toute assez simple : créer une promenade maritime soulignant l’axe liant le

<p><b>POURQUOI CONTRIBUER ?</b></p><p>L’aboutissement
d’une telle entreprise profiterait grandement d’un support financier du grand

100% dans la mise en espace du Village Éphémère, un espace public ouvert à tous. En
plus de promouvoir un design urbain participatif et de soutenir les citoyens et
organismes du quartier dans leurs revendications concernant la sécurité et
l’accès au site, cet évènement offrira aux designers montréalais une vitrine
d’exception auprès de la communauté du grand Montréal et d’ailleurs. 
Ceux-ci seront les premiers

construction de la promenade maritime en bois, à la mise en place d’une plage,
à la création de jardins ou à la location de conteneurs entre autres exemples, ces
bourses permettront cette année de financer une partie ou la totalité des
installations des designers sélectionnés. Ces derniers qui auront pour mandat l’aménagement
des conteneurs, la création de mobiliers ou la réalisation de toutes autres installations
renforçant l’expérience des visiteurs. Le montant de ces bourses actuellement
établies à 500 $ pourra fluctuer selon le financement acquis grâce à notre

<p>Tactac wants to become an Independent Publishing House so let's start with a book.</p>
<p>The first book is the 2013 Tactac Planner. I wanted a book written by readers to start. So the idea has resulted in a minimal <span>weekly </span>planner. </p>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.tactac.it/immagini/a.JPG"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<h3>TACTAC 2013 PLANNER</h3>
<p>The Tactac Planner will be protected by two parallel <span>elastics (tac tac). This idea is perfect to keep a pen or a pencil linked to the spine and paper, ticket, leaflets or similar will eventually find a place on the cover.</span></p>
<p><span>Tactac Planner is 175 x 105 mm (6.8 x 4.1 inch). </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.tactac.it/immagini/d.JPG"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>The Planner will be minimal, pure, essential with no logos or numbers on the cover with no ""azimuth distancies between cities"" and useless things like that. You will find a year calendar and the days of the week. </span></p>
<p><span><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.tactac.it/immagini/b.JPG"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To start the production of 1000 planner I need <span>$ </span>7.000. The Tactac Planner will be printed on a Fedrigoni Paper <a href=""http://www.fedrigoni.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.fedrigoni.com/</a> it is maybe the best recycled paper on the globe. Then it will be folded and binded in a professional <span>bookbindery in Verona. So it will be entirely MADE IN ITALY with high quality materials. The 2013 Planner is in English. </span></p>
<p><span>I need to pay the paper, the <span>typographer, the book bindery to obtain 1000 copies. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Then the planner will be ready for the market. Revenues will be used entirely to finance the publishing house so I will contact artists, authors, people, sellers, readers...  </span></span></p>
<p>So step 1: Tactac 2013 Planner. step 2:  Tactac Independent Publishing House.</p>
<p>If the project will fail, contributors and friends will have nevertheless a fantastic minimal planner for 2013. If the project will be successful you will help Tactac to become more than a planner. </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<div>
<p>The 2013 Planner is intended to be a present or to be sold. If you know a library, a bookshop, or a company <span>that need more planners (for example a Christmas gift for employees or clients) just give'em the link of this campaign. I would really appreciate that.</span></p>

<p>First off, I would like to say thank you clicking on this link to read more about my campaign! My name is Shavone and I am the owner of The Sugar Hut.  It all started with Meetups in August 2013! We then created the Hawaii's First Macaron Dessert Truck in October 2014, but ceased operations in October 2015 as I had bigger dreams for my small business. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">I envisioned a physical location for my business.  A place that we could call home. The opportunity to make more than just macarons and truffles, an actual bakery. </span></p>
<p>We've searched high and low and finally found the perfect place in March 2016. We will be located at 87-070 Farrington Hwy., between Westcoast Cutz and Countryside Cafe.  We hope to open our doors in early May! <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458192243/o7ldllvksqddh5shetwn.jpg"" src="""" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""/><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">I am asking for your help, because after all, we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for your support.  This campaign is important to me as it will allow us to open a storefront where you can get your cravings fulfilled throughout the week, not just Thursday's and Saturday's.</span></p>

</div></div>","From Meetups to a Storefront Hey Sweets! 
First off, I would like to say thank you clicking on this link to read more about my campaign! My name is Shavone and I am the owner of The Sugar Hut.  It all started with Meetups in August 2013! We then created the Hawaii's First Macaron Dessert Truck in October 2014, but ceased operations in October 2015 as I had bigger dreams for my small business. I envisioned a physical location for my business.  A place that we could call home. The opportunity to make more than just macarons and truffles, an actual bakery. 
We've searched high and low and finally found the perfect place in March 2016. We will be located at 87-070 Farrington Hwy., between Westcoast Cutz and Countryside Cafe.  We hope to open our doors in early May! I am asking for your help, because after all, we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for your support.  This campaign is important to me as it will allow us to open a storefront where you can get your cravings fulfilled throughout the week, not just Thursday's and Saturday's.
Helps us build a bakery.   What We Need & What You Get We've already invested about $30,000 into our business, but there are still things we need to purchase in order to open our storefront.  So here's the deal, this is what we need:

$3,500 - Commercial Convection Oven

$11,000 - Plumbing, Electrical and Construction
