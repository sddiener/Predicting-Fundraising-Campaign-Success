</h3><p>It is said that on Halloween the boundary between the living and the dead is at its thinnest. What better time to revive a dead book series?</p><p><i>Welcome to Monsteropolis </i>will be the first book of the Spooky Basement series, an immature horror/comedy anthology I tried to Kickstart this past summer. The series of twelve books didn't reach its goal, which only proves that Kickstarter is bad luck.<br/></p><p>Below is the synopsis of <i>Welcome to Monsteropolis</i>, and you can also find sample chapters at the bottom of the page. They've been revised since Kickstarter, and Chapter Six is entirely reworked, so check them out even if you're a veteran. The only real difference is I've cut back the language to a PG-13 level to broaden the audience; violence is still at a hard ""R movie for twelve-year-olds"" level.<br/></p><p>Synopsis:</p><p>When Baron and his best friend/guitar Garindax get sucked into a portal 
while attending a birthday party, they are transported to the kingdom of
 creeps known as ""Monsteropolis."" There, they tear apart a haunted 
hotel, race hoverboards across graveyards, and fight in a gladiator 
match against the one and only Boogeyman. Will the duo be able to battle
 their way back to Earth in time to kill some cake, or will they rot 
forever under Monsteropolis' black-lit sun?<br/></p><p> </p><h3>The Impact<br/>
</h3>I have no idea. It should at least get you pumped. If it makes you contemplate your own mortality or volunteer at a chimp rescue habitat or something, then that's all good, too. I think 1990's <i>The Willies </i>said it best with the tagline, ""You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll puke, you'll die."" <br/><p></p> <p> </p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>There aren't any. If this campaign is funded, and unless the world explodes or something, <i>Welcome to Monsteropolis </i>will get written and self-published (electronically) with the target date of summer 2015.<br/><p></p> <p> </p><h3>What the Money Is for<br/>
</h3>I've had a lot of fun writing this book so far, and I'm going to continue writing it whenever I have free time. This campaign is really to
 confirm public interest in a way that will make me share the product 
when it's done rather than keep it to myself. It will also make me dedicate time out of each day to get it finished sooner, cover self-publishing costs, and buy beer for my cover artist.<br/><br/><div> <h3>Sample Chapters</h3>

Over the last twenty years I have authored hundreds of articles on classical and modern esotericism, from both an academic and practical perspective. In addition, I have authored six books on alchemy, qabala, Freemasonry, prayer, and after-life-survival.  Many of these titles have been translated into Russian, French, Spanish, Polish, and Portuguese.  </p><div>
</div><p>In September of 2014 the Institute for Hermetic Studies initiated its own publishing activities known as the ""IHS Study Guides"", specializing in high quality student and reader requested materials. Our first title, ""Light on the Path - A Study Guide for Qabal, Alchemy, and Astrology"" was successful enough in the first month to warrant the release of a second title. In October of 2014 we released ""The Inner Way - The Power of Prayer and Belief in Spiritual Practice.""  </p><div>
</div><p>This campaign is to raise $4,000 (US), sufficient funds to continue the process of reader supported specialty publications whose mass appeal may be limited, but whose importance to the niche audience is exceptional, some even say critical, to their understanding of the topics presented.</p><div>
</div><p>Financial support in the order of $4,000 will provide the Institute for Hermetic Studies with approximately $3,000 after fees and donor perks are deducted, thereby providing funding for TWO new titles in the IHS Study Guides Series.  </p><div>
</div><p>These titles are:</p><div>
<p>Child of the Sun – Psychic &amp;
Physical Rejuvenation in Alchemy and Qabala (IHS Vol. 3)</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Sea of Sapphire – Visionary
Techniques and Talismanic Magic with the Tree of Life (IHS Vol. 4)</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In funding the publication of these
volumes, you will be assisting in making available this little known
material available in a practical and clear manner to a wider
audience of students. This will aid not only to individual students,
but also those working in more organized settings to bring about the
fullness of the expression of what the 17<sup>th</sup> Century
Rosicrucians called, the Light, Life, and Love in each of us.

Over the last twenty years I have authored hundreds of articles on classical and modern esotericism, from both an academic and practical perspective. In addition, I have authored six books on alchemy, qabala, Freemasonry, prayer, and after-life-survival.  Many of these titles have been translated into Russian, French, Spanish, Polish, and Portuguese.  
In September of 2014 the Institute for Hermetic Studies initiated its own publishing activities known as the ""IHS Study Guides"", specializing in high quality student and reader requested materials. Our first title, ""Light on the Path - A Study Guide for Qabal, Alchemy, and Astrology"" was successful enough in the first month to warrant the release of a second title. In October of 2014 we released ""The Inner Way - The Power of Prayer and Belief in Spiritual Practice.""  
This campaign is to raise $4,000 (US), sufficient funds to continue the process of reader supported specialty publications whose mass appeal may be limited, but whose importance to the niche audience is exceptional, some even say critical, to their understanding of the topics presented.
Financial support in the order of $4,000 will provide the Institute for Hermetic Studies with approximately $3,000 after fees and donor perks are deducted, thereby providing funding for TWO new titles in the IHS Study Guides Series.  
These titles are:
Child of the Sun – Psychic &
Physical Rejuvenation in Alchemy and Qabala (IHS Vol. 3)


Sea of Sapphire – Visionary
Techniques and Talismanic Magic with the Tree of Life (IHS Vol. 4)


In funding the publication of these
volumes, you will be assisting in making available this little known
material available in a practical and clear manner to a wider
audience of students. This will aid not only to individual students,
but also those working in more organized settings to bring about the
fullness of the expression of what the 17th Century
Rosicrucians called, the Light, Life, and Love in each of us.   

   What We Need & What You Get It costs approximately $3,000 to bring a non-fiction book to market. However, with IHS volunteers, we have been able to reduce that cost to about $1,500 per title.  In short, we can produce two books for the cost of one.  Funds raised will be used to cover costs of proofreading, copyediting, and typesetting/design.   If we do not reach our goal, funds less than $1,500 will be donated to The Louis Claude de St. Martin Fund (of the Luzerne Foundation), and existing volumes in the IHS Study Guides Series will be substituted for future volumes for donor perks.

<p><b>Long Version:</b></p>
<p>My name is Joshua Phair. I have been
writing, teaching, training, and speaking publicly since I was 12.  I was
recently Co-Author of another book that went Best Seller titled <i>The Rise</i> by Author Greg S. Reid. </p>
<p>I have always been very
involved.  In my youth there was drama,
debate, choir, soccer, wrestling, track, and scouting.  I also began composing music in my teens,
played violin, and piano.  </p>
<p>I was chosen in 7<sup>th</sup> grade
to go to a high school literary event in the state of Oregon.  It was about this same time that I
discovered a LOVE for books.</p>
<p>My passion, however, is for speaking,
coaching and teaching others, helping them realize how very important they
are.  </p>
<p>After the passing of Jim Rohn, Og
Mandino, Zig Ziglar and some of the truly great authors, we now live in a world
where three brands of self-awareness and improvement books are needed.  </p>
<p><b>Inspiration</b>
– Stories of amazing people accomplishing amazingly beautiful and great
things.  This gives us hope and allows us
to free our imaginations, and in liberation learn to dream and create again.</p>
<p><b>Motivation</b>
– Stories of perseverance, consistency, and true grit, showing social proof of
others sticking to it when things get tough. 
This helps us continue in action though we may have temporarily lost
sight of the dreams we seek to create. </p>
<p><b>Enlightenment</b>
– Stories, Metaphors, Analogies that help us to gain clarity with regard to who
we are, why we are here, and where we are going.  This helps us live life with passion, and
with purpose so that whatever dreams we are creating may give lasting joy and
complete fulfillment.</p>
<p>It does not matter the order they
are in, as everyone’s journey is their own, but all three are essential.</p>
<p>My first solo book to be published
in 24 years will be in the inspiration area. 
The Phoenix Phenomenon gives hope by allowing all to see that there is
really no such thing as failure.  The
stories will come alive and paint a picture that even in the direst of
circumstance may hope be found.</p>
<p><b>Who is my inspiration for this book?</b></p>
<p>While I write it to reunite my
family, the inspiration for this book is my Father.</p>
<p>My greatest Hero is my Dad.  I wrote a poem for my father not too long
ago.  He was disheartened after some
circumstances beyond his control and felt no longer deserving of the Superman
“S” that he had on his chest.  The poem
will give you a better idea of why he is my Hero.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><span><i><b>The
man who adopted one child more...</b></i></span><br/><br/><span>Panic, awake... <br/>
can this be?<br/>
The dream... <br/>
yet again it comes to me...<br/><br/>
Your family is not complete, <br/>
God already gave us five, <br/>
adopted two more, <br/>
and then, we felt alive...<br/><br/>
Yet again this dream, <br/>
it comes to me.<br/>
Telling me, “Look again, <br/>
it’s not complete.”<br/><br/>
Somewhere, <br/>
there is another one.<br/>
He is waiting,<br/>
and will become your fifth son.<br/><br/>
Again, <br/>
strange circumstance occurs...<br/>
Receive a phone call, <br/>
and something stirs.<br/><br/>
Another boy needed you, <br/>
Call it fate or guidance of the spirit.<br/>
You replied in hushed tones,<br/>
""Send him for a visit.""<br/><br/>
And so a boy came<br/>
and stood re-united, <br/>
with is two other brothers, <br/>
and was simply delighted...<br/><br/>
No more lost and lonely, <br/>
he was finally found.<br/>
And given a home, <br/>
where love would abound.<br/><br/>
He grew and he grew, <br/>
and became he a man.<br/>
Imitating the good<br/>
that he saw in that man. <br/><br/>
A man who, <br/>
in faith, listened to a dream.<br/>
A dream that to others, <br/>
impossible would seem.<br/><br/>
Peacefully, awake... <br/>
the dream comes to me?<br/>
The dream that stills my troubled heart, <br/>
and brings me great peace...<br/><br/>
Your family is complete.<br/>
I gave you five, and then gave you three more. <br/>
Thank you for listening, and when you get here,<br/>
there will be an open door...</span></p>
<p><b>Joshua S. Phair - October 15<sup>th</sup>,
2013</b></p><p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><span>There
are many other reasons that this amazing man is my Hero.  I only have time for one more.</span></p>
<p><span>My
Dad and his beautiful and loving wife, took care of both their mothers toward
the end of their lives.  My Dad’s mom
lived in their house and, for many years, was cared for until she passed.</span></p>
<p><span>So
when my in-laws got sick in 2012, I decided a little prematurely that it was
time I followed in my father’s footsteps. 
They were big shoes to fill, and though in no way do I consider my
attempt a failure, I had to come home early to prepare financially for when I
can really up the game and continue an amazing legacy.</span></p>
<p><span>So
my wife and beautiful children stayed behind to make sure that my in-laws were taken
care of , and I came home to begin again. 
In the last 6 months with the help of some amazing mentors, I have
finally shed the large portion of self-doubt that has held me back all these
years from publishing my own works.</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">What are others Saying?</b><br/></p><p><span></span></p><p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/karlmons"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.1;"">Karl Monson</a><br/></p>

</h3><p>       The mission of Writespace is to support writers. We seek to cultivate a space for community and learning for writers in the Houston area and beyond. But ""space"" doesn't just mean physical space to us. It also means creating conversation between writers. At Writespace, we support writers of all genres, including writers of literary fiction, poetry, science-fiction, fantasy, mystery, young adult, and other genres. We promote diversity, quality, and imagination in literature.</p><p>       Founded in May of 2014, Writespace has had an amazing two years. We've seen people who thought that they were just ""dabbling"" at writing become committed to putting writing first in their lives. Through our weekly writing workshops led by some of Houston's finest writing teachers, we've been able to support writers who can't afford to earn an MFA in Creative Writing by providing high-quality training and mentorship opportunities. </p><div>
<p>       During our first two years, Writespace has served:  </p>
<p>•     Over 600 writers through over 80 writing workshops </p>
<p>•     Over 350 writers and readers through 10 readings </p>
<p>•     Over 90 writers through our shared-space write-ins program</p>
<p>•     Over 50 writers through our editing services</p>
<p>       Between year one and year two, we have more than doubled the number of writers we serve, as well as our yearly revenue (though operations still fit within the category ""shoestring""). In year three we plan to more than double our numbers again, so that we can do an even better job of supporting writers.</p>

About Writespace
       The mission of Writespace is to support writers. We seek to cultivate a space for community and learning for writers in the Houston area and beyond. But ""space"" doesn't just mean physical space to us. It also means creating conversation between writers. At Writespace, we support writers of all genres, including writers of literary fiction, poetry, science-fiction, fantasy, mystery, young adult, and other genres. We promote diversity, quality, and imagination in literature.       Founded in May of 2014, Writespace has had an amazing two years. We've seen people who thought that they were just ""dabbling"" at writing become committed to putting writing first in their lives. Through our weekly writing workshops led by some of Houston's finest writing teachers, we've been able to support writers who can't afford to earn an MFA in Creative Writing by providing high-quality training and mentorship opportunities. 
       During our first two years, Writespace has served:  
•     Over 600 writers through over 80 writing workshops 
•     Over 350 writers and readers through 10 readings 
•     Over 90 writers through our shared-space write-ins program
•     Over 50 writers through our editing services
       Between year one and year two, we have more than doubled the number of writers we serve, as well as our yearly revenue (though operations still fit within the category ""shoestring""). In year three we plan to more than double our numbers again, so that we can do an even better job of supporting writers.


About Our Instructors
       Writespace boasts a first-class faculty based out of Houston, Texas and beyond. Our instructors have published novels, collections, and nonfiction works in all genres. During Writefest we bring in talented journal editors and writers from around the nation so that emerging writers from Houston and beyond can learn from their expertise.



About Writespace's Programs 
Workshops: Writespace hosts one-day, 4-week, and 6-week writing workshops in a variety of genres. Past workshop topics included how to find an agent, science fiction and fantasy, mystery, writing for children, novel writing, short story, and poetry. A listing of our summer workshops is available on our website. 
Young Writers:  Writespace is proud to host workshops for young writers age 14-19. 
Readings: Writespace hosts open mics, readings, and book signings. Through the support of the community, we have been able to host some great events last year since our founding, such as Lit Con, a Halloween open mic, a Writers of Faith reading, faculty readings and more! We offer a reduced rate to local writers who want to launch their book with us and offer 100% of all book sale proceeds back to the writers. 
Editing Services and Manuscript Consultations: Writespace offers manuscript critiques, consultations, and editing services geared toward creative writers. 
Write-Ins: Writespace offers weekly write-ins in Houston. Write-Ins provide writers a quiet space to write away from the lure of necessary home chores, the demands of family, and the attention-suck of the Internet.

Writers Family Reunion




Come Find Your Writing Family at the Writers Family Reunion!



       The Writers Family Reunion is a one-day gathering and community-building event that Writespace will host Saturday, August 20th. The Family Reunion is designed to give writers an opportunity to develop friendships with other writers, learn from more experienced writers, and fortify their knowledge of craft and career. All levels and all genres are welcome!


       Join us for fun activities, such as: 

Critique group speed dating 
Small group first page feedback sessions and Q&As with professional writers
Literary games like Literary Prize Roulette, Hopscotch Haiku, and Pin-the-Mustache-on-William-Faulkner

      Along with opportunities to meet local writers, attending writers will have the opportunity to discover fantastic local literary resources; form new critique groups, join existing ones, or just learn about them; and bolster their knowledge of how to complete projects, submit, find agents, and publish. 
       To learn more, go here.    


       Registration is open! You can register via our site or by signing up for the Writers Family Reunion perk on the righthand side of the page.

Writefest
 
       Writefest is a week-long writers festival taking place March 6-12th, 2017 in Houston, TX. The festival kicks off with a series of Monday-Friday workshops and culminates in a weekend filled with presentations, critique sessions, panels by local and national literary journal editors of all genres, a Literary Journal Fair, and readings by local and nationally-recognized authors.


       Three factors make Writefest unique among national writing events:
1. A focus on short forms (short stories, flash fiction, creative nonfiction pieces, personal essays, and poetry). 2. A focus on literary journals and magazines.3. A focus on writers of all experience levels, genres, and backgrounds.


       One of our campaign goals is to bring in a nationally recognized author to serve as Writefest's 2017 keynote speaker! Last year's keynote speakers included Jordan Bass of McSweeney's and Neil Clarke of Clakesworld. Registration for Writefest 2017 opens in August 2016.

</h2><h2><span><br/></span></h2><p><b>What?<br/></b>Learn stress management through knowledge and integrative therapies that create a fundamental basis for human health in order
to prevent future problems. The solution is truly sustainable because it involves balancing the lifestyle
and diet of each individual's unique physiology. Every person is different. This stress management technique is a lifelong practice to help prevent illness and negative life
experiences<b>.<br/></b></p><b>How? <br/></b>I have interviewed outstanding
holistic doctors and health practitioners as well as conducted my

research and studies, I have broken through and discovered information that is
unknown to many. I have written a book that I want to share freely. It
addresses one of the most common problems on the individual and societal level
in modern day culture: stress. In the book I research into stress, the body's
stress response, the effects and temporary coping mechanisms. I find answers  to many questions about stress, wellness, anxiety, insomnia, etc. Within the book you will find instructions on how to manage stress anytime in your life. Also, I want to create a website that will be a resource for
information as well as a forum for group support.<h2><br/></h2><p><b>Why?<br/></b>
Knowledge is forever; your whole life. Learn this knowledge one time and keep
it for life vs. endless doctor visits. By living in accordance with the laws of
nature, life is more likely to be extended, you can live in balance and manage
your own health issues. Only with severe imbalances may a
practitioner be needed. <br/></p><p>
</p><p>What motivated me to write the book with this research? Why I should explain ancient knowledge with modern science?

</p><p>First, everybody believes in science and wants to
have proof of any healing therapies in research. We ask: what is it for me in this
old science of life as we call Ayurveda or even in modern integrative
therapies? Why not to go to doctor, MD, who has such extensive training to know
everything in this world about health?</p>
<p>Yes, doctor had
training in medicine but not wellness, not alternative therapies but only in
diagnosis and treatment of disease with medicines. They don`t have time to
learn about new alternative therapies and can`t tell if it is safe or not.  Alternative health providers can`t recommend much sometimes too
because they have limitation in this regard. However, we have freedom of
information privilege and we have right to research, educate and advocate our
knowledge. In addition, everybody has right to tell
about his/her personal story that other people can learn something about that
and prevent it.</p>
<p>Second, many disorders  and imbalances could be helped with ancient and integrative therapies, which I learned and research.  I would like to tell other people how to
prevent and eliminate many health problems and reduce stress response with natural therapies including Ayurveda. However, nobody will follow recommendations in full if they don`t understand the value of this knowledge. It require some gradual lifestyle changes, better food choices and other modalities that can help only in long term. Though supplements can help more fast they can bring only about 20% of success in healing. Most recommendations are made appropriate to individual type of physiology after personal consultation but I can make general recommendations for everybody.  <br/></p><i></i><p></p><h2>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p></p>
<p>My name is Rosalie Morales Kearns. I’m a writer/editor of
Puerto Rican and Pennsylvania Dutch descent, based right now in Albany, NY. I’m
starting a small book publishing company, Shade Mountain Press, which will
publish literary fiction by women authors. Two titles are scheduled to be
published in 2014: <i>Egg Heaven</i>, a
short story collection by Robin Parks; and <i>Her
Own Vietnam</i>, a novel by Lynn Kanter.</p>
<h2>Why I'm Doing This</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Women are still vastly underrepresented among authors of
literary fiction. Only about 25% to 30% of authors published in literary
journals are women. Of the authors whose books get reviewed in the major book
review outlets, again, less than a third are women. Same situation in book
publishing--and this is the case whether the publisher is a huge conglomerate
or a small, supposedly cutting-edge press. At some publishers, the percentage
of women authors of literary fiction is as small as 10%.</p>
<p>I noticed this trend myself as I researched publishers who
might be interested in my own novel manuscript. Time after time, the “new and
forthcoming” sections of reputable small, literary presses included only one
female author out of eight, or one out of ten. Sometimes a publisher’s entire
“new and forthcoming” list was male.</p>
<p>Lots of good articles are being written about this trend. The
arts organization VIDA: Women in Literary Arts (<a href=""http://www.vidaweb.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.vidaweb.org</a>) is always
posting links to relevant articles from places like <i>NPR, The Atlantic, The Nation</i>, and <i>Salon</i>.</p>
<p>I’m trying to be part of the solution. </p>
<p></p>
<h2>Why This Matters</h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>I happen to know that women are writing great things.
Besides teaching writing classes, I go to writers’ conferences, I join writers
groups. I hear women writers read from their works-in-progress, and it’s
brilliant, amazing stuff. </p>
<p>I want their voices to be heard. I especially want to read
more works by women from groups historically underrepresented among literary
authors: women of color; women with disabilities; women from working-class backgrounds;
lesbian/bisexual/queer women.</p>
<p>Obviously, one small publishing house by itself can’t solve
this problem. But it’s a step in the right direction.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>How I'm Qualified to Do This</h2>
<p>I’ve been a freelance copyeditor of book manuscripts for
twenty years, first with a research institute (where I worked with book
designers and printers and had hands-on experience with layout) and then as a
freelancer. I’ve also taught creative writing at the college level and in adult
education classes, so I’ve had a lot of experience working with authors.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2>What I Need</h2>
<p>The figure of $13,000 includes general start-up costs: a website,
attorney’s fees for author contracts, ISBNs. Per-book costs include cover
design, copyediting, paper, printing, binding, shipping, and promotion.</p>
<p>I would like Shade Mountain books to be printed using
traditional offset printing, rather than print-on-demand (POD). Using offset printing
for my books gives me more options for type design and paper, results in a
higher-quality finished product, and gives my books a better chance of being
ordered by bookstores and libraries.</p>
<p>Having startup capital is crucial for book publishing. When
a customer buys a book in a bookstore or an online site like Amazon, the store
or online site keeps about 55% of the money the customer paid. The distributer
takes another 5-10%. The 35% that the publisher receives can take nine months
or more to arrive--and then part of that, of course, goes to the authors as
royalties. This process can become self-sustaining after a few years if you
have decent sales and maintain a good-quality list, but in the meantime, you
need money upfront.</p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>

I have done 5 internships in my collegiate career: CAI Insurance, Merrill Lynch, CapitalSouth Partners, TPG Sourcing Advisors, Brookwood Associates, and Goldman Sachs. I have learned a lot in attaining the above experiences and I tried many different strategies in my process. I want to share the lessons I learned along the way to help more students acheive their goals. I think the best way to help the most students is through a book. I have the manuscript written, but I need your help to fund the upfront publishing costs!What We Need & What You GetI am seeking $2,000 in funding for:1. Editing the manuscript- $7502. Ebook Conversion- $2503. Printing Costs- $1,000Table of Contents for Cash in Your Diploma1. Establishing a Presence on Campus""The best effort of a fine person is felt after we have left their presence.""-Ralph Waldo Emerson2. Goal Setting for College Students""Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible.""-Tony Robbins 3. Build Relationships""If civilization is to survive, we must cultivate the science of human relationships - the ability of all peoples, of all kinds, to live together, in the same world at peace."" -Franklin D. Roosevelt4. How can a College student possibly add value?""I've always been seen as the underdog in everything I've ever done in my life, and it doesn't bother me in the slightest. The lessons have just made me stronger."" -Victor Ortiz“It's not the size of the dog in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the dog.”-Mark Twain5. Master Awkward Small Talk“Discomfort brings engagement and change. Discomfort means you’re doing something that others were unlikely to do, because they’re hiding out in the comfortable zone.” - Seth Godin6. Follow up to Succeed""Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not: nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not: the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent."" - Calvin Coolidge7. Internships are the New B.A. ""When I was a 21-year-old intern at CBS, I was told I had crossed eyes and shouldn't try to be on air. That's when I decided I was going to be behind the scenes."" - Andy Cohen""My biggest bit of advice would be to spend some time actually helping caterers or Chefs, even if it has to be for free or as an intern of culinary externship. It helps immerse yourself in what you potentially want to do."" - Giada De Laurentiis""I started in the mailroom, literally, as an intern... in 1974. The legislator I was working for at the time said, 'I want you to get your law degree and come back here and get elected and be the first woman governor.' I kind of took that guy seriously - I thought that sounded like a pretty good idea."" -Claire McCaskill ""I think the lie we've told people in the marketplace is that a degree gets you a job. A degree doesn't get you a job. What gets you a job is the ability to carry yourself into that room and shake a hand and look someone in the eye and have people skills. These are the things that cause people to become successful."" - Dave Ramsey 8. The Internship of Getting an Internship“It is good to have an end to journey toward; but it is the journey that matters, in the end.” ― Ernest Hemingway9. Avoid being an analyst for Coffee Running LLC""A winner is someone who recognizes his God-given talents, works his tail off to develop them into skills, and uses these skills to accomplish his goals."" Larry Bird ""To succeed, you will soon learn, as I did, the importance of a solid foundation in the basics of education - literacy, both verbal and numerical, and communication skills."" - Alan Greenspan 10. The Telephone is a Deadly Weapon ""Life is way too short to be small."" -Benjamin Disraeli11. Infrastructure of You“Investing in yourself is the best investment you will ever make. It will not only improve your life, it will improve the lives of all those around you.” -Robin Sharma""The most successful men in the end are those whose success is the result of steady accretion. . . It is the man who carefully advances step by step, with his mind becoming wider and wider - and progressively better able to grasp any theme or situation - persevering in what he knows to be practical, and concentrating his thought upon it, who is bound to succeed in the greatest degree."" - Alexander Graham Bell""What can I learn today that I didn't know before?"" - Donald Trump 12.

I deeply appreciate the support, particularly through the darkest times."" - Elon Musk18 Give Back and Helps Others“Happiness begins where selfishness ends.” -John Wooden“Only a life lived for others is a life worthwhile.” - Albert Einstein “The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches, but reveal to them their own.” - DisraeliBonusInaction-Iron rusts from disuse, stagnant water loses its purity and in cold weather becomes frozen, even so does inaction sap the vigors of the mind.

I am still young and I certainly don't claim to know everything. But I have tried many different methods using a trial and error process to narrow in on the most successful tactics.

<p>  A successful trip
will be safe completion, beyond that I hope to find new places to call home,
find new individuals to call friends, make a positive impact with writing and
share meditative movement for wellness in the war world. It will be a book tour
toward raising individual consciousness and collective awareness. I am inspired
by my tai chi chuan teacher to proceed on a compassionate course to enhance
consciousness and wellness. The more people I can help heal themselves, through
sharing writing or sharing meditative movement, the more successful a journey I
will consider it.  </p>
<p>  Honestly though,
in the end I’ll never be comfortable with success if nuclear experimentation remains
acceptable.  So as I proceed on my
journeys I intend to share information on nuclear experimentation, through my
voice, printed articles, flyers, stickers maybe, and of course continuing to
write on the subject, the danger it presents to all of our successes, dreams
and opinions or whatever. Educating individuals about nuclear experimentation will
be a major focus.  </p>
<p>  A wise person once
told me that to stop something, don’t fight it, start something better. In
order to implement new systems, build the anew and people will gravitate to
whatever is better without fluctuation, without confrontation. I wholeheartedly
endorse this, however when there is a fire that does not burn out like nuclear
fires, one must control it first before building new structure.</p>
<p>  Nuclear
experimentation casts the biggest shadow, is the most diabolical specter there
is. In order for humanity to put out the fire of global nuclear experimentation
we need to educate and uplift each other. Nuclear experimentation operates in
the same manner as the petrolithic industry; elements are mined, refined and
then set afire with life threatening processes at every step. The differences
between petrolithic and nuclear fuel burning is that some nuclear waste is
deadly for millions of years and risks entirety like the ongoing disasters at Fukushima,
Hanford and more recently W.I.P.P. in New Mexico.  </p>
<p>  I want to ask you for your assistance in
expanding my journey that is a fourfold plan of promoting writing, raising individual
consciousness, sharing wellness through meditative movement and sharing
information on nuclear experimentation. I plan on being on the road for many
months, flowing with the flow, sharing writing, meditative movement and
educating people about the ongoing fire preventing implementation of more
integrative energy systems though its mere existence. Grand success for me
would be playing a part in the progression toward stopping global nuclear experimentation
and beginning integrative energy sources -labeled alternative- instead of the hyper
deadly and destructive nuclear and petrolithic systemization.</p>
<p>  Your contribution
toward a successful book tour is invaluable to me personally and professionally.  Your financial contribution will go toward the
van, fuel, flyers, articles on consciousness and nuclear experimentation, books
and towards speaking engagements across the continent. Your contribution, on a personal
level, would fuel me with the confidence to go forth  </p>
<p>  Please consider making
a donation to my endeavors as an artist, healer and activist. Please also share
this with your local yoga studio, tai chi chuan group, bookstore, community
center, meditative group, ashram, radio program or whomever in your area that
might offer a place to exchange ideas as I go or otherwise support. If any of your
friends might consider supporting my endeavors to raise awareness of individual
consciousness and collective awareness of nuclear experimentation with whatever
you are able. I’m honored for you to read and share, I’m humbled and extremely grateful
for your financial contribution, connection, and assistance in any form. Thank
you, gratefully,</p>

<p>Here’s what some have said about Ethan Indigo Smith’s
writing:</p>
<p>Transport J. D. Salinger's Holden Caulfield to the 21st
century and you get the protagonist of The Terraist Letters. This rollicking
journey through NYC, juxtapositions the mainstream, the lamestream and the
out-of-stream as the Terraist heroes attempt to bring some sanity as well as
medicinal cheer to the urban zombies of today. Ethan's work will titillate,
irritate, but most importantly, stimulate some serious thought concerning
current conventions. Give it a read. Your brain might thank you.</p>
<p>~New York Times Best Selling author, groundbreaking researcher,
Jim Marrs </p>
<p>It's (The Complete Patriot’s Guide) a book to read a few
pages at a time, and then contemplate for hours after. It's written as a
learning experience, the facts, quotes and ideas bundled together in a way
which leads to our own thoughts as the material moves on. I remember when 1984
was ushered in, wondering: ""What next?"" Ethan wondered as well, and
the results of his curiosity and writing, if not the answer, will lead to the
answer. </p>
<p>~Deborah Meier, Senior Scholar NYU, founder of the modern
small schools movement</p>
<p>I found Ethan's writing extremely informative.  I liked it and it's interesting.</p>
<p>~Immortal Technique</p>
<p>Ethan has a rare ability to 'Universalize' concepts from
different traditions such as yoga, tai chi, chi gung, ancient Egypt, Kabbalah
and modern science. The 108 Steps is very inspiring and describes the feeling
of being in The Zone and how to get there.</p>
<p>~Manoj Chalam, Physicist and Metaphysics Yogi </p>
<p>Ethan's work on meditation achieves a level of rarefied
quality so necessary to metaphysical writing and teaching. The 108 Steps is
simple and profound, and rich in details and analogies that bring the inner
truths of diverse traditions into usefulness in the present time. It is as
simple as the profoundness of a child taking its first steps, the mathematical
intricacies of numerology, astrology and ancient wisdom in Ethan's writing make
entering this world of spiritual development an exciting and safe journey…</p>
<p>~Laura Peppard, Founder and Director of the Reno Psychic
Institute</p>
<p>Ethan writes cold, hard and direct. He defines patriotism
exactly, but more than that, Ethan explores reality thoroughly. The book is
informative, inspiring and highly enlightening. </p>
<p>~Allah B, Nation of Gods and Earths, Harlem</p>
<p>“I enjoyed the Matrix of Four. Ethan’s excursions take you
to fertile philosophical ground.”</p>
<p>~John S. Engstrom, President of Arthur Young’s Institute for
the Study of Consciousness</p>

Printed Threat about events that turn a pot dealer into a book dealer, my political
nonfiction The Little Green Book of Revolution, The Complete Patriot’s Guide to Oligarchical Collectivism and the serious and hilarious A Holiday Hazing Santa Claus Syndrome.  
  A successful trip
will be safe completion, beyond that I hope to find new places to call home,
find new individuals to call friends, make a positive impact with writing and
share meditative movement for wellness in the war world. It will be a book tour
toward raising individual consciousness and collective awareness. I am inspired
by my tai chi chuan teacher to proceed on a compassionate course to enhance
consciousness and wellness. The more people I can help heal themselves, through
sharing writing or sharing meditative movement, the more successful a journey I
will consider it.  
  Honestly though,
in the end I’ll never be comfortable with success if nuclear experimentation remains
acceptable.  So as I proceed on my
journeys I intend to share information on nuclear experimentation, through my
voice, printed articles, flyers, stickers maybe, and of course continuing to
write on the subject, the danger it presents to all of our successes, dreams
and opinions or whatever. Educating individuals about nuclear experimentation will
be a major focus.  
  A wise person once
told me that to stop something, don’t fight it, start something better. In
order to implement new systems, build the anew and people will gravitate to
whatever is better without fluctuation, without confrontation. I wholeheartedly
endorse this, however when there is a fire that does not burn out like nuclear
fires, one must control it first before building new structure.
  Nuclear
experimentation casts the biggest shadow, is the most diabolical specter there
is. In order for humanity to put out the fire of global nuclear experimentation
we need to educate and uplift each other. Nuclear experimentation operates in
the same manner as the petrolithic industry; elements are mined, refined and
then set afire with life threatening processes at every step. The differences
between petrolithic and nuclear fuel burning is that some nuclear waste is
deadly for millions of years and risks entirety like the ongoing disasters at Fukushima,
Hanford and more recently W.I.P.P. in New Mexico.  
  I want to ask you for your assistance in
expanding my journey that is a fourfold plan of promoting writing, raising individual
consciousness, sharing wellness through meditative movement and sharing
information on nuclear experimentation. I plan on being on the road for many
months, flowing with the flow, sharing writing, meditative movement and
educating people about the ongoing fire preventing implementation of more
integrative energy systems though its mere existence. Grand success for me
would be playing a part in the progression toward stopping global nuclear experimentation
and beginning integrative energy sources -labeled alternative- instead of the hyper
deadly and destructive nuclear and petrolithic systemization.
  Your contribution
toward a successful book tour is invaluable to me personally and professionally.  Your financial contribution will go toward the
van, fuel, flyers, articles on consciousness and nuclear experimentation, books
and towards speaking engagements across the continent. Your contribution, on a personal
level, would fuel me with the confidence to go forth  
  Please consider making
a donation to my endeavors as an artist, healer and activist. Please also share
this with your local yoga studio, tai chi chuan group, bookstore, community
center, meditative group, ashram, radio program or whomever in your area that
might offer a place to exchange ideas as I go or otherwise support. If any of your
friends might consider supporting my endeavors to raise awareness of individual
consciousness and collective awareness of nuclear experimentation with whatever
you are able. I’m honored for you to read and share, I’m humbled and extremely grateful
for your financial contribution, connection, and assistance in any form. Thank
you, gratefully,

Here’s what some have said about Ethan Indigo Smith’s
writing:
Transport J. D. Salinger's Holden Caulfield to the 21st
century and you get the protagonist of The Terraist Letters. This rollicking
journey through NYC, juxtapositions the mainstream, the lamestream and the
out-of-stream as the Terraist heroes attempt to bring some sanity as well as
medicinal cheer to the urban zombies of today. Ethan's work will titillate,
irritate, but most importantly, stimulate some serious thought concerning
current conventions. Give it a read. Your brain might thank you.
~New York Times Best Selling author, groundbreaking researcher,
Jim Marrs 
It's (The Complete Patriot’s Guide) a book to read a few
pages at a time, and then contemplate for hours after. It's written as a
learning experience, the facts, quotes and ideas bundled together in a way
which leads to our own thoughts as the material moves on. I remember when 1984
was ushered in, wondering: ""What next?"" Ethan wondered as well, and
the results of his curiosity and writing, if not the answer, will lead to the
answer. 
~Deborah Meier, Senior Scholar NYU, founder of the modern
small schools movement
I found Ethan's writing extremely informative.  I liked it and it's interesting.
~Immortal Technique
Ethan has a rare ability to 'Universalize' concepts from
different traditions such as yoga, tai chi, chi gung, ancient Egypt, Kabbalah
and modern science. The 108 Steps is very inspiring and describes the feeling
of being in The Zone and how to get there.
~Manoj Chalam, Physicist and Metaphysics Yogi 
Ethan's work on meditation achieves a level of rarefied
quality so necessary to metaphysical writing and teaching. The 108 Steps is
simple and profound, and rich in details and analogies that bring the inner
truths of diverse traditions into usefulness in the present time. It is as
simple as the profoundness of a child taking its first steps, the mathematical
intricacies of numerology, astrology and ancient wisdom in Ethan's writing make
entering this world of spiritual development an exciting and safe journey…
~Laura Peppard, Founder and Director of the Reno Psychic
Institute
Ethan writes cold, hard and direct. He defines patriotism
exactly, but more than that, Ethan explores reality thoroughly. The book is
informative, inspiring and highly enlightening. 
~Allah B, Nation of Gods and Earths, Harlem
“I enjoyed the Matrix of Four. Ethan’s excursions take you
to fertile philosophical ground.”
~John S. Engstrom, President of Arthur Young’s Institute for
the Study of Consciousness",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>You're invited to be a part of producing <i>Cold Wax Medium: Techniques, Concepts &amp; Conversations</i>, the first comprehensive book exploring the many aspects of using cold wax.</h3>
<p>This is an important moment for the many artists who are discovering the beauty and subtlety of cold wax medium. Until now, no comprehensive book has been available on the topic--one that covers in depth both the <i>how</i> and the <i>why</i> of creating with cold wax medium.  With the publication of our book, that is about to change. The book is co-authored by Rebecca Crowell, whose workshops and art have played a major role in the cold wax revival, and artist Jerry McLaughlin. More than just a technical guide, it provides essential information for artists who are new to cold wax, as well as inspiration and ideas for those already using it. This book represents a broad community: over 100 working artists from around the world have contributed images, ideas, and methods.</p>
<p>Rebecca began her work with cold wax over 15 years ago, and has taught hundreds of people in her highly regarded workshops. Over the years, many of these artists requested that she write a book. A year and a half ago <span>Jerry's proposal to collaborate persuaded her, and we launched this project. Initially we planned a modest print-on-demand book with a few featured artists. However, so many people were excited about the project and eager to share their ideas and experiences that the book grew far beyond initial plans.  We are indebted to the cold wax community for the overwhelming support that has helped our vision grow. </span></p>
<p><span><b>With your help, we now hope to honor this expanded vision of the book by publishing enough copies to meet the large demand we anticipate and to produce the most beautiful volume possible.</b></span></p>
<p><b>Here's what we anticipate the book will look like:</b></p>

This is an important moment for the many artists who are discovering the beauty and subtlety of cold wax medium. Until now, no comprehensive book has been available on the topic--one that covers in depth both the how and the why of creating with cold wax medium.  With the publication of our book, that is about to change. The book is co-authored by Rebecca Crowell, whose workshops and art have played a major role in the cold wax revival, and artist Jerry McLaughlin. More than just a technical guide, it provides essential information for artists who are new to cold wax, as well as inspiration and ideas for those already using it. This book represents a broad community: over 100 working artists from around the world have contributed images, ideas, and methods.
Rebecca began her work with cold wax over 15 years ago, and has taught hundreds of people in her highly regarded workshops. Over the years, many of these artists requested that she write a book. A year and a half ago Jerry's proposal to collaborate persuaded her, and we launched this project. Initially we planned a modest print-on-demand book with a few featured artists. However, so many people were excited about the project and eager to share their ideas and experiences that the book grew far beyond initial plans.  We are indebted to the cold wax community for the overwhelming support that has helped our vision grow. 
With your help, we now hope to honor this expanded vision of the book by publishing enough copies to meet the large demand we anticipate and to produce the most beautiful volume possible.
Here's what we anticipate the book will look like:
 

Here is a peek at Chapter 1 (unedited):


The book includes:

Waning and Waxing: The Story of Cold Wax Medium
Essentials: Materials and Tools of Cold Wax Painting
Substrates: From the Ground Up
About Ateliers: Studio Setup, Safety, and Cleanup
Alla Prima: Beginnings and Quick Paintings
Building History: Step by Step

The Elements of Art: Using Visual Language 

Inner Work: Your Personal Voice
Looking Outward: Referencing the Recognizable
Putting Things Together: Collage and Assemblage
Branching Out: Further Possibilities
It’s a Wrap: Finishing Steps

</div></div>","Headmistress Press is an independent publisher of books of poetry by lesbians. Headmistress was born on January 1, 2013 and is
lovingly run by your three dedicated mistresses, Mary Meriam, Risa Denenberg,
and Rita Mae Reese. Headmistress Press is dedicated to honoring lesbian existence, discovering a range of lesbian voices, and promoting lesbian representation in the arts. We published three fabulous books in 2013
and five extraordinary books in 2014.  As
we enter year three, we are feeling energetic and want to grow, grow, grow. In
2015, we intend to publish ten books of poetry, produce an amorous pack of 12 lesbian poet trading cards,
introduce our first annual Charlotte Mew Chapbook Contest, and publish the anthology Lavender Review: Poems from the First
Five Years. Whew, we are getting ambitious! We want your participation in
our dreams!  
Who we are: We are lesbian poets! Our commitment as editors of Headmistress
Press is an unpaid labor of love. 
Mary Meriam,
Headmistress Co-founderMary is the founder of Lavender Review, an international, biannual e-zine dedicated to poetry and art by, about, and for lesbians. She conceived
of and birthed Headmistress Press and is our designer, editor, and publisher par
excellence. She makes our gorgeous books. 
Risa
Denenberg, Headmistress Co-founderRisa is a skilled editor, and our accounting and bookkeeping devotee.
Rita Mae
Reese, Headmistress of MarketingRita Mae has recently joined the team of
Headmistress bringing years of experience working for a lesbian press along
with her to use as our marketing maven. 


What We Need &
What You Get
We are trying to raise $3000 to develop and complete the following exciting
projects in 2015: 
1) Announcing: Lesbian poet trading cards!Our goal is to produce a series of full-color, collector-worthy trading
cards featuring a lesbian poet each month, displaying the poet’s photo,
biography, and words. With so many wonderful poets to venerate, this is our way
of paying tribute to past and present poets, whether self-identified as lesbian
or not, whose work has not been promoted nearly enough. This project is our way
of honoring lesbian existence, recognizing a range of lesbian voices, and promoting lesbian representation in the arts. We intend
to produce cards for sale and as gifts to our supporters.
The money we raise with your help will allow us to print, safely package, and mail 100 Limited Edition sets of 12 Lesbian Poet Cards for 2015. We expect that sales of
these cards will be seed money to continue with a series of 12 cards in 2016
and beyond. Be sure to get the jump on the first cards produced as your gift

will be to have series one!

<blockquote><span><b>TELL YOUR MEN THEY CAN SHOOT ME</b> <br/>Written by: Gian Marco Benedetto<br/></span></blockquote>
<h3></h3>
<p>""<i>Tell your men they can shoot m</i>e"" is not just a <i>book</i>, it is 
also an experiment in <i>free culture </i>to support conscientious objection to
 military service and war.<br/> For almost nine months working with the solidarity of those who make possible the sharing of information.<br/> This book was born with no producer / publisher behind.<br/> Now to be realized, it also needs your help.<br/><br/>
 Translations, travel, study of the law, interviews, implementation and 
post-implementation make up the  book's cost. It should be collect at least the 
sum of € 3,800 to finalize everything and be able to breathe a sigh of 
relief before proceeding to the final distribution.<br/><br/> Any work of 
genius comes from stimuli that are the foundation of social life and 
relationships with others, as well as by the knowledge already acquired 
and consolidated from which each of us continually draws.<br/> The author 
is opposed to ""intellectual property"" in a radical way and has no 
business project staff in order to produce a good traded.<br/> So do not 
worry if you do not have great resources. Even a small donation can make
 a difference. Even just talking to a friend can be crucial. I invite 
you to share the campaign via the tools Indiegogo on your channels and 
social networks.<br/><br/> In return you will be able to print the book 
directly from home and bind it yourself if you want. you can download 
the E-book, or request a print copy, a public presentation by the 
author, a postcard of the book, the presence of your name in the credits
 for the construction of the whole.<br/><br/> And look at that at stake is
 much more than repay the work and effort of those who are presenting an
 independent project. It is possible to show that this route is viable 
and that the culture and information must move freely and not be used 
for war. As people in the Mediterranean.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3></h3>
<h3></h3>
<p>""<i>Dica pure ai suoi che possono spararmi</i>"" non è solo un libro, è anche un esperimento di <i>cultura libera </i>per sostenere l'obiezione di coscienza al servizio militare e alla guerra. <br/>Da ormai nove mesi funziona grazie alla solidarietà di chi rende possibile la condivisione delle informazioni. Questo libro è nato senza nessun produttore/editore 
alle spalle. <br/>Ora per essere realizzato, ha bisogno anche del 
vostro aiuto. <br/></p>
<p>Traduzioni, spostamenti, studio delle normative, interviste, realizzazione e post-realizzazione del libro 
costano. Si deve raccogliere almeno la cifra 
di 3.800 € per ultimare tutto e poter tirare un sospiro di sollievo prima di procedere alla definitiva diffusione. </p>
<p>Una qualsiasi opera d'ingegno scaturisce dagli stimoli che sono alla base del vivere sociale e delle 
relazioni con gli altri, oltreché dal sapere già acquisito e consolidato 
dal quale ognuno di noi continuamente attinge. <br/>L'autore si oppone 
alla ""proprietà intellettuale"" in maniera radicale e non presenta alcun 
progetto di business personale al fine di produrre un bene oggetto di 
commercio. Non preoccupatevi dunque se non avete grandi risorse.
 Anche una piccola 
donazione può fare la differenza. Anche solo parlarne con un 
amico può essere fondamentale. Ti invito a condividere la campagna 
tramite i tools di Indiegogo e sui tuoi canali e social network. <br/><br/>In
 cambio potrai stampare il libro direttamente da casa e rilegarlo tu 
stesso se vorrai. potrai fare il download dell'eb-ook, o richiedere una 
stampa cartacea, una presentazione
 pubblica con l'autore, una cartolina del libro, la presenza del vostro 
nome nei ringraziamenti per la realizzazione del tutto.
</p>
<p>E guardate che in ballo c'è molto di più del ripagare il lavoro e lo 
sforzo di chi sta presentando un progetto indipendente. C'è la 
possibilità di dimostrare che questa via è percorribile e che la cultura
 e le informazioni devono circolare liberamente e non servire per fare 
la guerra. Come le persone nel Mediterraneo.</p>

<div>“Tell your men they can shoot me” sadece bir kitap değil, aynı zamanda zorunlu askerlik ve savaş karşıtı vicdani reddi desteleyen bir free culture denemesi.</div>
<div>Bu kitap çalışması bilgilerini cömertçe paylaşmaktan çekinmeyen insanların destekleri sayesinde, yaklaşık dokuz aydır devam ediyor. </div>
<div>Bu kitap arkasında herhangi bir yapımcı / yayıncı desteği olmaksızın yayınlanacaktır. Ve tabi ki tanınması ve yaygınlaşması için sizlerin yardımına ihtiyaç duymaktadır. Çeviriler, yolculuk masrafları, hukuki çalışmalar, röportajlar, kitabın yazım ve yazım sonrası çalışmaları… Her şeyin bitirilmesi ve nihai dağıtıma girmeden önce rahat bir nefes alınabilmesi için toplamda en az 3.800 € tutarında bir meblağın toplanması gerekiyor.</div>
<div>Tüm yaratıcı işler, sosyal hayatın ve toplumsal ilişkilerin temelini oluşturan dürtülerden olduğu kadar her birimizin sürekli yararlandığı mevcut ortak bilgilerden de ortaya çıkar. </div>
<div>Yazar “fikri mülkiyet” denilen kavrama kökten karşı çıkmakta olup herhangi bir ticari kaygı gütmemektedir. Bu nedenle katkı sağlayacak kişilerin çok fazla kaynak ayıramamaktan endişe etmelerine gerek yok. Çok küçük miktarlardaki bağışlar bile büyük farklar yaratabilir. Hatta sadece bir arkadaşınızla bu kitap hakkında konuşmanız bile son derece önemli bir katkı sağlayacaktır. </div>
<div>Herkesi, Indiegogo.com sitesi üzerinden  başlatılan bu kampanyayı arkadaşlarına ve sosyal ağlarındaki insanlara duyurmaya davet ediyoruz. </div>
<div>Bunun karşılığında destekçiler kitabı evlerinde doğrudan indirebilecek ve isterlerse ciltletebileceklerdir. E-kitap olarak indirebilecekler ya da basılı bir kopyasını, yazarın kitap tanıtımını ve kitap için tasarlanan bir posta kartını talep edebileceklerdir. Ayrıca tüm katılımcıların adları hazırlanacak olan teşekkür listesinde yer alacak. Burada nelerin söz konusu olduğunun anlaşılabilmesi, bağımsız bir proje ortaya koyan kişilerin çaba ve gayretleri için onlara maddi katkıda bulunulmasından çok daha önemlidir. Bunun geçerli bir yol olduğunu, kültür ve bilginin tıpkı Akdeniz insanları gibi serbestçe dolaşması ancak savaşlar için kullanılmaması gerektiğini göstermek mümkündür.</div>

 military service and war. For almost nine months working with the solidarity of those who make possible the sharing of information. This book was born with no producer / publisher behind. Now to be realized, it also needs your help.
 Translations, travel, study of the law, interviews, implementation and 
post-implementation make up the  book's cost. It should be collect at least the 
sum of € 3,800 to finalize everything and be able to breathe a sigh of 
relief before proceeding to the final distribution. Any work of 
genius comes from stimuli that are the foundation of social life and 
relationships with others, as well as by the knowledge already acquired 
and consolidated from which each of us continually draws. The author 
is opposed to ""intellectual property"" in a radical way and has no 
business project staff in order to produce a good traded. So do not 
worry if you do not have great resources. Even a small donation can make
 a difference. Even just talking to a friend can be crucial. I invite 
you to share the campaign via the tools Indiegogo on your channels and 
social networks. In return you will be able to print the book 
directly from home and bind it yourself if you want. you can download 
the E-book, or request a print copy, a public presentation by the 
author, a postcard of the book, the presence of your name in the credits
 for the construction of the whole. And look at that at stake is
 much more than repay the work and effort of those who are presenting an
 independent project. It is possible to show that this route is viable 
and that the culture and information must move freely and not be used 
for war. As people in the Mediterranean.

DICA PURE AI SUOI CHE POSSONO SPARARMIWritten by: Gian Marco Benedetto





""Dica pure ai suoi che possono spararmi"" non è solo un libro, è anche un esperimento di cultura libera per sostenere l'obiezione di coscienza al servizio militare e alla guerra. Da ormai nove mesi funziona grazie alla solidarietà di chi rende possibile la condivisione delle informazioni. Questo libro è nato senza nessun produttore/editore 
alle spalle. Ora per essere realizzato, ha bisogno anche del 
vostro aiuto. 
Traduzioni, spostamenti, studio delle normative, interviste, realizzazione e post-realizzazione del libro 
costano. Si deve raccogliere almeno la cifra 
di 3.800 € per ultimare tutto e poter tirare un sospiro di sollievo prima di procedere alla definitiva diffusione. 
Una qualsiasi opera d'ingegno scaturisce dagli stimoli che sono alla base del vivere sociale e delle 
relazioni con gli altri, oltreché dal sapere già acquisito e consolidato 
dal quale ognuno di noi continuamente attinge. L'autore si oppone 
alla ""proprietà intellettuale"" in maniera radicale e non presenta alcun 
progetto di business personale al fine di produrre un bene oggetto di 
commercio. Non preoccupatevi dunque se non avete grandi risorse.
 Anche una piccola 
donazione può fare la differenza. Anche solo parlarne con un 
amico può essere fondamentale. Ti invito a condividere la campagna 
tramite i tools di Indiegogo e sui tuoi canali e social network. In
 cambio potrai stampare il libro direttamente da casa e rilegarlo tu 
stesso se vorrai. potrai fare il download dell'eb-ook, o richiedere una 
stampa cartacea, una presentazione
 pubblica con l'autore, una cartolina del libro, la presenza del vostro 
nome nei ringraziamenti per la realizzazione del tutto.

E guardate che in ballo c'è molto di più del ripagare il lavoro e lo 
sforzo di chi sta presentando un progetto indipendente. C'è la 
possibilità di dimostrare che questa via è percorribile e che la cultura
 e le informazioni devono circolare liberamente e non servire per fare 
la guerra. Come le persone nel Mediterraneo.

                 ADAMLARINA SÖYLE, BENI VURABILIRLER

                  Yazan: Gian Marco Benedetto

“Tell your men they can shoot me” sadece bir kitap değil, aynı zamanda zorunlu askerlik ve savaş karşıtı vicdani reddi desteleyen bir free culture denemesi.
Bu kitap çalışması bilgilerini cömertçe paylaşmaktan çekinmeyen insanların destekleri sayesinde, yaklaşık dokuz aydır devam ediyor. 
Bu kitap arkasında herhangi bir yapımcı / yayıncı desteği olmaksızın yayınlanacaktır. Ve tabi ki tanınması ve yaygınlaşması için sizlerin yardımına ihtiyaç duymaktadır. Çeviriler, yolculuk masrafları, hukuki çalışmalar, röportajlar, kitabın yazım ve yazım sonrası çalışmaları… Her şeyin bitirilmesi ve nihai dağıtıma girmeden önce rahat bir nefes alınabilmesi için toplamda en az 3.800 € tutarında bir meblağın toplanması gerekiyor.
Tüm yaratıcı işler, sosyal hayatın ve toplumsal ilişkilerin temelini oluşturan dürtülerden olduğu kadar her birimizin sürekli yararlandığı mevcut ortak bilgilerden de ortaya çıkar. 
Yazar “fikri mülkiyet” denilen kavrama kökten karşı çıkmakta olup herhangi bir ticari kaygı gütmemektedir. Bu nedenle katkı sağlayacak kişilerin çok fazla kaynak ayıramamaktan endişe etmelerine gerek yok. Çok küçük miktarlardaki bağışlar bile büyük farklar yaratabilir. Hatta sadece bir arkadaşınızla bu kitap hakkında konuşmanız bile son derece önemli bir katkı sağlayacaktır. 
Herkesi, Indiegogo.com sitesi üzerinden  başlatılan bu kampanyayı arkadaşlarına ve sosyal ağlarındaki insanlara duyurmaya davet ediyoruz. 
Bunun karşılığında destekçiler kitabı evlerinde doğrudan indirebilecek ve isterlerse ciltletebileceklerdir. E-kitap olarak indirebilecekler ya da basılı bir kopyasını, yazarın kitap tanıtımını ve kitap için tasarlanan bir posta kartını talep edebileceklerdir. Ayrıca tüm katılımcıların adları hazırlanacak olan teşekkür listesinde yer alacak. Burada nelerin söz konusu olduğunun anlaşılabilmesi, bağımsız bir proje ortaya koyan kişilerin çaba ve gayretleri için onlara maddi katkıda bulunulmasından çok daha önemlidir. Bunun geçerli bir yol olduğunu, kültür ve bilginin tıpkı Akdeniz insanları gibi serbestçe dolaşması ancak savaşlar için kullanılmaması gerektiğini göstermek mümkündür.

<p>Whether it's Shakespeare, Jane Austen, or Nora Roberts, love stories are my passion. As an author, my greatest pleasure is connecting directly with my readers, which is why I am choosing to self-publish this book. However, to paraphrase a popular saying, it takes a village to self-publish a novel, and that's why I'm asking for your help. Contributing to this campaign will make it possible for a hardworking author to persue her dreams.</p>
<h3>About the Book:</h3>
<p><em>Buck's Landing</em> is a summer romance set on the New Hampshire seasoast. It is the first of a proposed quartet of New England seacoast novels, each exploring a different seaside community and season.</p>

Hi. I'm Cameron Garriepy, author of the forthcoming contemporary romance, Buck's Landing.
I'm an author and fiction blogger, as well as a managing editor for Write on Edge.
I have previously published a YA/Fantasy novella and two short stories. You can find out more about those on my Amazon Author's Page.
Whether it's Shakespeare, Jane Austen, or Nora Roberts, love stories are my passion. As an author, my greatest pleasure is connecting directly with my readers, which is why I am choosing to self-publish this book. However, to paraphrase a popular saying, it takes a village to self-publish a novel, and that's why I'm asking for your help. Contributing to this campaign will make it possible for a hardworking author to persue her dreams.
About the Book:
Buck's Landing is a summer romance set on the New Hampshire seasoast. It is the first of a proposed quartet of New England seacoast novels, each exploring a different seaside community and season.
After her father's untimely death, Sofia Buck has returned to her hometown to run his mini-golf and vacation rental business, Buck's Landing, for the summer. She left Hampton Beach, and the misery of her widowed father's alcoholism, ten years ago, vowing to never return. She wants nothing more than to fulfill her obligations and get out of town, until her next door neighbor throws a wrench in her plans.
Silas Wilde walked away from a lucrative but soul-crushing career, determined to live life on his own terms. Hampton Beach called to him, and running a convenience-slash-gift shop on the boardwalk suits him just fine. He didn't realize his new life was missing something until he met Sofia.
As July turns into August, their chemistry sizzles and their emotions tangle, but their goals pull them in different directions.
Is the potential for happiness enough to banish Sofia's demons? Is a summer romance enough to satisfy Silas's desires?
The opening lines, as well as excerpts about Sofia and Silas are available on my blog.

<p><font><font size=""4""><b>Hope... is something
that all living creatures cling to when they are desperate. Like the
frenzied animal with it's leg caught in a trap desperately thinking that the next pull of its leg, no matter how painful, will bring
freedom. But unfortunately, hope like everything else in this desolate
unforgiving world, can easily wither away for even the strongest of
will.<br/><br/>Hardak is what they call this place. A fitting name for
a desert with no sand. Blown away years ago by the high winds of the
night. All that remains is sun baked hard pan with the occasional
clusters of sharp gutting rock that look like the teeth of a giant
buried monstrosity.<br/><br/>It is in these harsh elements we find a
gang of hardened thugs transporting a bounty in the form of human
cargo. Kidnapping, once a harshly punished crime now goes unnoticed
and even rewarded at this time of year. <br/><br/>Bound by their wrists
and tethered to the back of a caravan, this group of newly captured
slaves have listened to the music like repetition of the caravan's
wheels and horses hooves beating the path for several long days. With
the only break in rhythm being the occasional bark of an order or
painful crack of the whip. This is why one of the slaves found it so
strange to hear a faint but clearly audible ""Pssst!"".<br/><br/>Slowly lifting
his head, careful not to catch the unwanted attention of his captors,
the slave searches for the source of the sound. But not one person, slave or slaver was looking in his direction. Just when he was
beginning to think that what he heard was a figment of his exhausted
mind. Asham catches a glance from the female slave next to him.<br/><br/>In
a hushed tone she whispers into the dust. ""I overheard them
say..."" pausing to look around to make sure none else will hear
her. ""...that we're almost there."" Having traveled for
several days without being given so much as a drop of water. Asham's
exhausted mind couldn't help but ask ""Almost where?""
Mouthing the words “Hardak's captial: ...“ the 2nd part of the sentence was viciously interrupted by the
unmistakable sound of a whip loudly cracking through the air towards
the female slave.<br/><br/>An arc of blood instantly sprayed from her
back through her ragged clothes where the whip struck her across the
back. Her scream: a piercing sound loud enough to make him want to cover his ears. Though he would never get the chance as the crack of a 2nd whip instantly sends Asham to a world of blackness as the female slave's scream
echos in his unconsciousness mind.<br/></b>

Caught in between this world and the land of dreams, Asham struggles to make sense of the confusion inside his head. His mind, slowly awakening, is telling him what he sees before his eyes must be a dream. But what if it wasn't, he tells himself. What if his parents were actually still alive. That their gruesome death was only a dream.<br/><br/>Euphoric happiness and profound relief fills inside of him as he lets this thought soak in. Yes! They really are still alive!
Then it begins to fade. Strange muted sounds seem to come from
nowhere. Like the sound of a dozen soldiers putting on armor at the
same time. Dread begins to creep in. His parents faces fade, replaced
with the blurry outline of a female figure holding a water skin in
hand and shaking him with the other. <br/><br/>”Get up!” the female slave yells into his damaged ear. “The guards are
coming right now!” Struggling to his feet Asham only has enough
time to notice a gate before him opening, and the gleaming walls
stocked with weapons and armor, just like the people standing around
him. When he hears a strange male voice filled with twisted laughter bellow ""IT'S
SHOWTIME!"" followed by a violent shove from behind. The force
of the push sends Asham flying forward out of the darkness and into
the all too bright sunlight, landing hard on his hands and knees.

inside the circular shaped arena cheer madly with each kill delivered
by the beast, punctuated with “Ooooooh's” and “Ahhhhhh's”
for each significant strike landed by a slave. Asham's strategy of
not making any sudden moves to attract the attention of the beast has

eyes behind a large gate shrouded in darkness, that could only belong
to the female slave who helped him moments earlier. Without a hint of

arena directly into the eye of the beast preparing to take his life.

<p><span lang=""EN-GB"" style=""font-family: inherit; color: #666666;"">Prostibulo Poetico is a multi lingual poetry experience which has been
  internationally recognized and most recently listed by the Guardian as one of
  the 10 best art spots in Barcelona. Prostibulo Poetico is in partnership with
  The Poetry Brothel, Poetry Society of New York, LLC, whose mission is to
  expand both poets’ and non-poets’ personal, intellectual and fiscal interest
  in poetry through performances, workshops, publications, and other projects.
  Prostibulo Poetico developed in early 2009 as a performance art event aimed
  at fostering intimacy, urgency and exaltation within the Barcelona poetry
  community, and at expanding that community to include a more diverse
  population. Today it provides a structure and set of values that unite
  communities of poets all over the world, poets who are committed to
  experiencing and expressing poetry in an personal way—a way that is more true
  to the nature of poetry itself.</span><span lang=""EN-GB""></span></p><p></p><p></p>

<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"">Based on the concept of the prewar brothels in the United States and
  Europe, many of which functioned as safe havens for the fledgling,
  avant-garde artists of the times, Prostibulo Poetico, like the Poetry Brothel
  events present both male and female, emerging and established poets. The
  creation of character, as both disguise and freeing device, enables the
  Prostibulo Poetico to be a place of uninhibited creative expression, for
  poets and audience alike. Each poet, under an alias, offers the intimacy of
  his or her original poetry in one-on-one readings for a fee. Recognizing that
  poets undervalue themselves in the creative marketplace, Prostibulo Poeticol
  hopes to confirm both for writers and the public the literal monetary value
  of such vital work. Since its inception Prostibulo Poetico has thrown off
  three major branches—Venezuela, Los Angeles, and Chicago—and inspired several
  satellite poetry brothel events in Belfast, Ireland; Leister, England;
  London, England; Oaxaca, Mexico; Auckland, New Zealand; Seattle, Washington;
  Portland, Oregon; and Akron, Ohio. Given the high level of interest in the project,
  The Poetry Brothel is taking steps to expand its reach by establishing bases
  of operation throughout the world.</span><br/></p>

Our Story

Prostibulo Poetico is a multi lingual poetry experience which has been
  internationally recognized and most recently listed by the Guardian as one of
  the 10 best art spots in Barcelona. Prostibulo Poetico is in partnership with
  The Poetry Brothel, Poetry Society of New York, LLC, whose mission is to
  expand both poets’ and non-poets’ personal, intellectual and fiscal interest
  in poetry through performances, workshops, publications, and other projects.
  Prostibulo Poetico developed in early 2009 as a performance art event aimed
  at fostering intimacy, urgency and exaltation within the Barcelona poetry
  community, and at expanding that community to include a more diverse
  population. Today it provides a structure and set of values that unite
  communities of poets all over the world, poets who are committed to
  experiencing and expressing poetry in an personal way—a way that is more true
  to the nature of poetry itself.

Based on the concept of the prewar brothels in the United States and
  Europe, many of which functioned as safe havens for the fledgling,
  avant-garde artists of the times, Prostibulo Poetico, like the Poetry Brothel
  events present both male and female, emerging and established poets. The
  creation of character, as both disguise and freeing device, enables the
  Prostibulo Poetico to be a place of uninhibited creative expression, for
  poets and audience alike. Each poet, under an alias, offers the intimacy of
  his or her original poetry in one-on-one readings for a fee. Recognizing that
  poets undervalue themselves in the creative marketplace, Prostibulo Poeticol
  hopes to confirm both for writers and the public the literal monetary value
  of such vital work. Since its inception Prostibulo Poetico has thrown off
  three major branches—Venezuela, Los Angeles, and Chicago—and inspired several
  satellite poetry brothel events in Belfast, Ireland; Leister, England;
  London, England; Oaxaca, Mexico; Auckland, New Zealand; Seattle, Washington;
  Portland, Oregon; and Akron, Ohio. Given the high level of interest in the project,
  The Poetry Brothel is taking steps to expand its reach by establishing bases
  of operation throughout the world.

Presently, we are only $2000,1700Euro away from meeting our fundraising goal
  for launching.  Libro Rojo ed. 3, a collection of poems by the poets of
  the Prostibulo. Every dollar helps. To donate even as little as $5 would be
  to support an innumerable number of poets and artists in this area.

Prostibulo Poetico thanks you from the bottom of its collective heart
  for your generous support. We cannot grow without your contributions and
  genuinely hope to meet you at an upcoming event. 




The Impact
People who cannot physically be here
  in Barcelona and want to support our writers will still be able to experience
   their poetry through a physical form of a book, that being Libro Rojo.
  If we do not meet our goal we will keep moving forward and host as many
  events as we can to be able to fund our project. In any case, we look forward
  to bringing you the best poetry that Barcelona can offer. If you would like
  to receive any further information about our events or poets please feel free
  to email us at prostibulopoetico@gmail

his heartless and greedy mother. Playing With The Devil is a novel based on
Byron’s true story of horrid child abuse in all of its forms: physical, mental,
emotional, verbal and worst of all – sexual. For obvious reasons, this book is
rated ‘R,’ so please do not flag this as inappropriate. What happened then and
what continues to happen to this day is just too important to simply dismiss.</p>
<p>While Byron’s father was away as captain of a ship, his mother made
ends meet by pimping out her own children to many of Grand Bank, Newfoundland’s
most prominent citizens – lawyers, judges, businessmen - even Salvation Army
officers. There was also the perverted next-door neighbor, many of the mother’s
friends and even other family members like Byron’s own grandfather – all of
whom took full advantage of these innocent children.</p>
<p>Byron’s abuse began at the hands of his mother when he was just 4 years
old. He was pulled into his mother’s bed at night and told to be nice to the
pedophile next door, if he knew what was good for him. When he committed even the
most innocent of acts, his hands were put on a burning hot wood stove, he was
severely beaten over and over again, and was badly injured from being thrown
through the back door and down the rear steps.</p>
<p>If all of that were not enough to endure, he also had to witness the
abuse of his younger brothers and sisters. He tried to comfort his siblings
when they were beaten by his mother and offered words of hope when they were
sexually assaulted by strangers. She often gave them over to sexual liaisons
for as little as a loaf of bread or for a gallon or two of gas in her car. On
one occasion, Byron washed his 4-year-old sister, who had just been raped by
their grandfather and left on the kitchen floor lying in a pool of her own
blood. </p>
<p>As the oldest of the 12 children, he always felt the burden of wishing he
could somehow help them. Even as a young boy, he sneaked out at night and ran to the
police station hoping someone would help – but they never did. <span>As an adult, he
went to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police many times -  in 1960, twice in 1962, 1966, 1968, about 1971
and in 1998 during which he gave a 2 1/2 –hour statement. </span><span>During the 70's, three of his sisters, one
brother and a niece, also made reports to the Grand Bank RCMP. One sister was
allegedly raped and became pregnant due to a sexual assault by </span>a minister of parliament. Since then,
Byron has taken his case to court representing himself, since he could not
afford a lawyer. On one occasion, he was committed to a mental facility because
he continuously and consistently told the truth about what happened to him and
to his siblings.Today, over 50 years later, Byron is still seeking justice for what was done to all of them. As you can see from his photo, he also traveled to Ontario a number of times to protest on Parliament Hill in Ottawa - in a continued effort to draw attention to this major injustice.</p>
<p>I am hoping to raise enough funds for Byron to hire a good
lawyer who will seriously represent him and help him find justice once and for
all. As well, it is my wish that my book, <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Playing With The Devil, which I wrote in an effort to get
Byron’s message out to the world, will acquire the support of a mainstream
publisher.  For a short time, this book was sold through a Calgary publisher but due to changes in the publishing arena over
the past few years, she will no longer be representing authors and/or their books. This change has forced me to seek other options. At
this time, the book is only available in ebook format on Amazon.com. My wish is
to get it back into the hands of a traditional publisher who will care as much
as I do about what happened to Byron and his siblings.</span></p>
<p>Therefore, my funding request is two-fold – money to help Byron launch a
strong lawsuit against the perpetrators of these horrible crimes and money to
publish this book in hard cover format so his devastating story of abuse can
reach more people worldwide. If the funding goal is met, I will provide updates
on both my and Byron’s progress on my blog site at <a href=""https://plus.google.com/105846981608373220977/posts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/105846981608373220977/posts</a>. </p><p>Please Note: Monies raised will be shared 70/30 with Byron receiving the larger amount.</p>

Since Angels &amp; Airwaves is releasing a new album this Halloween, I will also be releasing a super rare, limited edition run of the first draft of Love Beyond Life book II and it will be called the Dream Walker edition. It will be a physical book similar to Love Beyond Life book I. The final draft and published edition of book II will not be released until 2.14.2015, so this is your chance to get a look at the book months before it is finalized and released. By participating in this campaign, you will be getting both the Dream Walker edition as well as the finalized edition when complete.</p>
<p>For those of you who are not previously familiar with my work, my name is Jeffrey A Brown. For my honor's thesis project at UMass Dartmouth I wrote an Angels &amp; Airwaves inspired sci-fi novel called Love Beyond Life, back in 2011. In addition to featuring Tom DeLonge and the music of Angels &amp; Airwaves, the book also contained a love story as it explored my scientific hybrid of Psychology and Quantum Physics, which I call Quantum PsychoPhysics. It's a fun read that lead to a book tour back in 2011.</p>
<p>This campaign is very important to me because as a self-published author I try very hard to make my voice heard. I have been blessed over the years with a decent facebook audience and amazon presence. I am trying to stretch myself out even further with this campaign for the sequel to my hit novel, give people an opportunity to get a super-rare, limited run version of this book months before the official version is released and also release some other new merchandise as well.</p>
<p>Contributors will be a part of Love Beyond Life history, and will have an autographed (and numbered) version of the draft novel to show for it!</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The books themselves will be relatively easy to get done money-wise, as I've done self-publishing before and am familiar with the process. However, I do plan on pairing with this Dream Walker edition a new Love Beyond Life t-shirt called the Man On The Moon t-shirt, which the minimum shirts I can get produced is 30, and that will cost $460. So I am also using this campaign as a way to kickstart the new t-shirt. </p>
<p>Another brand new item to be included in this campaign will be a Dream Walker quote card, about the size of a credit card, which will feature a dream-related quote from Love Beyond Life book II. Sort of like a trading card.</p>
<p>In addition to the Man On The Moon t-shirt and Dream Walker quote card, there will be Man On The Moon 8x11 prints.</p>
<p>Previously created items will also be included in this campaign, such as:</p>

<li>Acclaimed Apocalypse posters</li>
<li>Summer of LOVE book tour t-shirts</li>
<li>Valentine's Day ""You are my adventure..."" poem greeting cards</li>

</div><p></p><h3>Our Story</h3><p>This May our 3 year old daughter Theolyn was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. As you can imagine this came as quite a shock to us and has remained extremely challenging as we have progressed through months of testing, evaluations and now physical, occupational, and speech therapies. Our friends and family have reached out to us and asked how they can help, and until now we've struggled to find a way that people could provide any aid because of how specific her needs are .</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1040385/files/20141123114054-IMG_0173.jpg?1416771654"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>The one thing we keep noticing is that most people don't really know what Autism is. And honestly we were not that aware of the broad spectrum of this disability. ASD manifests itself most strikingly as impairments in communication and in the formation of social relationships. Children with Autism are often nonverbal, or when they are verbal like Theolyn, they usually do not use the skill to actively communicate with other people in their environment. This significantly delays her development and education. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Many children with this disability have a strong need for a structured, routine environment; change creates feelings of fear and/or anxiety. This holds very true for our daughter.</span></p><div>
<p>Another behavior common to Autism is a tendency to wander away. Parents often refer to their children as “Houdini,” stating they are able to escape from even the most secured environment and the family usually has multiple locks on every door and window in the home. When this happens, the child may be in a life-threatening situation, especially if they are already out of the physical sight of their caregiver. Theolyn is very much in this category. We have been blessed so far that she cannot open doors with locks yet, but we know that is coming soon.</p>
<p>Children with Autism often don’t respond to their names consistently, if they respond at all. They rarely understand the many dangers in their environment; an approaching car, a stranger with ill intentions, or an aggressive dog. One of our greatest fears is that Theolyn will go missing, or that we might look away only for a minute and turn to find her gone or darting out into the path of an oncoming car. We face this every day with Theolyn. If we are at a park she runs directly away from us and will not respond to her name. We pretty much still carry her everywhere because of this behavior. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1040396/files/20141123114455-IMG_0139.jpg?1416771895"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>No one knows exactly what causes Autism but the children often appear to live in a world we have little understanding of. Often they participate in ritualistic and repetitive behaviors, sometimes for hours at a time.  Theolyn tends to walk/run in circles continuously, flap her hands, and makes any type of doll or toy ""go to sleep"".</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>Our goal is to provide an Autism Spectrum Disorder service dog for Theolyn. These service dogs are trained to deal with all of the behaviors mentioned above. An ASD service dog will stay with the child and contain her in a specified area. If the child does get away, the dog is trained in search and rescue. It will quickly lead the adult to the child even if she has been missing for quite some time. These dogs are also trained to disrupt the stimulation behaviors such as hand flapping or walking in circles. One of the most critical things is how these dogs help a child socially. They bond with the child and they tend to bring out social behaviors that are typically missing. Service dogs also promote social interaction with others as many people will want to interact with the dog and Theolyn.</p><p>This training does not come cheap. Months of training, housing, and veterinary care are invested in each dog. The full cost to train an ASD service dog is $15,000. We are looking to send our brand new Golden Retriever puppy, Winston(pictured below), through this training program. He will be evaluated within the next few weeks to determine if he meets the temperament requirements of the training program. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1040460/files/20141123121117-IMG_4512.jpg?1416773477"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>If we get the go ahead he will be boarded in the training program for 9 to 12 months. If he is not able to be trained, we will get a service dog for Theolyn that has already been through the program. This is the trainer we will be using not too far from us in Maryville, TN.  <a href=""http://www.wilderwood.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.wilderwood.org</a>.

We will provide updates with pictures and videos. And anyone is welcome to come visit Theolyn and meet her service dog.<p></p>

When this happens, the child may be in a life-threatening situation, especially if they are already out of the physical sight of their caregiver. Theolyn is very much in this category. We have been blessed so far that she cannot open doors with locks yet, but we know that is coming soon.
Children with Autism often don’t respond to their names consistently, if they respond at all. They rarely understand the many dangers in their environment; an approaching car, a stranger with ill intentions, or an aggressive dog. One of our greatest fears is that Theolyn will go missing, or that we might look away only for a minute and turn to find her gone or darting out into the path of an oncoming car. We face this every day with Theolyn. If we are at a park she runs directly away from us and will not respond to her name. We pretty much still carry her everywhere because of this behavior. 

No one knows exactly what causes Autism but the children often appear to live in a world we have little understanding of. Often they participate in ritualistic and repetitive behaviors, sometimes for hours at a time.  Theolyn tends to walk/run in circles continuously, flap her hands, and makes any type of doll or toy ""go to sleep"".

What We Need & What You GetOur goal is to provide an Autism Spectrum Disorder service dog for Theolyn. These service dogs are trained to deal with all of the behaviors mentioned above. An ASD service dog will stay with the child and contain her in a specified area. If the child does get away, the dog is trained in search and rescue. It will quickly lead the adult to the child even if she has been missing for quite some time. These dogs are also trained to disrupt the stimulation behaviors such as hand flapping or walking in circles. One of the most critical things is how these dogs help a child socially. They bond with the child and they tend to bring out social behaviors that are typically missing. Service dogs also promote social interaction with others as many people will want to interact with the dog and Theolyn.This training does not come cheap. Months of training, housing, and veterinary care are invested in each dog. The full cost to train an ASD service dog is $15,000. We are looking to send our brand new Golden Retriever puppy, Winston(pictured below), through this training program. He will be evaluated within the next few weeks to determine if he meets the temperament requirements of the training program. If we get the go ahead he will be boarded in the training program for 9 to 12 months. If he is not able to be trained, we will get a service dog for Theolyn that has already been through the program. This is the trainer we will be using not too far from us in Maryville, TN.  http://www.wilderwood.org. And this is a video describing the training process. http://wilderwood.org/autism/autism_dogs_video.html.If we don't reach our entire goal of fundraising we will use what is provided and attempt to fund the rest ourselves.Our fundraisers will receive the joy of knowing that they have helped a very sweet and special girl face the challenges of ASD. We will provide updates with pictures and videos. And anyone is welcome to come visit Theolyn and meet her service dog.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p style=""""><font size=""2"">Essentially, the focus of my project is to be able to show the public the tour life of a band that is currently working hard to become as famous as many of us dream to be when we are children. (Not to mention, any other bands that join us on the tour, which could also be musicians of considerable fame). Itâ€™s a chance to offer a glimpse into the glamourous (and un-glamourous!) world of the music industry and the touring portion of it to the vast and curious majority. Iâ€™m taking a very, very behind the scenes approach and aiming to keep everything 100% honest. When we go to a show as its viewer, we see the lights and feel the music. Concerts make an impact on us. We get the chance to experience the tinniest bit of the personalities and talents of these people we paid good money to see, someone who we might idolize. We leave the venue satisfied, buzzing, and hopefullyâ€¦ the band does to. You, the audience, then go back into your daily life, talking about the concert for days. Itâ€™s all you think about.</font></p>
<p style=""""><font size=""2""> The band, however, has to do something different.  They move onto the next town, a new hotel, new people and new experiences. They get a clean slate every night.</font></p>
<p style=""""><font size=""2"">Iâ€™m striving to capture that clean slate, capture what itâ€™s like to be on the other side of the veilâ€¦ to be able to understand how it feels to look out and see hundreds of screaming people, all who came to see YOU. How does that pressure affect someone? Is it all itâ€™s cracked up to be? I want to answer these serious questions, but also offer readers a chance to see the ways these bands entertain themselves during the long hours of driving between cities, running on lack of sleep and fast food. I want to capture the camaraderie and see just how strong these six wonderful people â€” and whatever bands accompany them â€” are.</font></p>
<p style=""""><font size=""2"">I will be updating the blog multiple times a week with everything from long posts to tid-bits, videos and memories.

I published my first book, Not Ashamed - The Path to Total Surrender, a few years ago. It was a great experience and I learned a lot. I have been married for 17 years and my wife and I have four children.<br/> <br/>I'm trying to raise money to properly package and promote this book. What I learned from “Not Ashamed” is that a good manuscript will only get you so far. It is vital to have an excellent brand with marketing and promotion. I am passionate about the ""Make Them Earn It Book and System”, because I have seen firsthand the change in me as a parent and in my children. I want to make it available to families so they can learn skills and techniques to produce happy, well-adjusted families.<br/> <br/>I believe a proverb that says people perish from lack of knowledge. We are suffering generation after generation from lack of parenting knowledge. My own family suffered before it was transformed by ""Making Them Earn It."" I would like to share it with the masses and to do that I need your help.<br/> <br/>We hope to raise $5000 or more to seed this project. We want to get it properly edited, branded, and promoted so people can be blessed.

I published my first book, Not Ashamed - The Path to Total Surrender, a few years ago. It was a great experience and I learned a lot. I have been married for 17 years and my wife and I have four children. I'm trying to raise money to properly package and promote this book. What I learned from “Not Ashamed” is that a good manuscript will only get you so far. It is vital to have an excellent brand with marketing and promotion. I am passionate about the ""Make Them Earn It Book and System”, because I have seen firsthand the change in me as a parent and in my children. I want to make it available to families so they can learn skills and techniques to produce happy, well-adjusted families. I believe a proverb that says people perish from lack of knowledge. We are suffering generation after generation from lack of parenting knowledge. My own family suffered before it was transformed by ""Making Them Earn It."" I would like to share it with the masses and to do that I need your help. We hope to raise $5000 or more to seed this project. We want to get it properly edited, branded, and promoted so people can be blessed. We believe that this book and system can really help many families. Our budget is as follows:$1,200 for Professional Editor$500 for Professional Typeset$1,000 for Professional Branding$1,300 for Professional Promotional Materials$1000 for online promotion  The beauty with the self-publisher, createspace, is that I have one price for books either 1 or 1000 and Direct Physical Distribution through Amazon.com. If we don't reach $5,000 ""Make Them Earn It"" will happen, we just will have a taller mountain to climb. I know this is my vision and I'm one of many people saying, ""Hey, can you help me get my vision out.""

<p><u><strong>Story of My Book</strong></u></p>
<i>The Purpose Cycle: Unlock the Secrets to Success is a tool to help improve your life by embarking on a self-improvement journey through five key stages.</i><br/><br/>My name is Jonathon Tucker and I am the author of The Purpose Cycle. I wrote this book because as a teacher, I love to inspire people every single day. I see how words, thoughts, ideas and dreams mould the person that we become. But is it ever too late to find a new aspiration? Can you become even more successful than you already are?<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover your Purpose. In this book, I hope to instil in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the everlasting journey of self-improvement. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you supersede your wildest dreams, and sit there in your elder years reflecting on everything that you’ve accomplished, rather than disdainfully look back on all what could’ve been.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about manifesting and realising your goals. You'll hear stories such as...<ul>
<li>my journey to find purpose across three timelines in my life</li>
<li>how to think internally to acknowledge your weaknesses and turn them into strengths</li>
<li>how others found their purpose through the most difficult situations in their lives</li>
</ul> You will love this book if you love to study personal development, aspire to become your greatest self, and you want to become fulfilled with your dream life.<br/><br/>The Purpose Cycle is a nonfiction book that speaks to young professionals and aspiring people who want to look at their purpose and their careers in a new way.<br/> <p><u><strong>The Book - The Purpose Cycle: Unlock the secrets to success</strong></u></p>
<br/><strong>The book is written in 5 parts:</strong><br/><br/><strong>Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters all about Aspiration.</strong> This section looks at how people begin to dream onto bigger things in life. How are aspirations formed? Are certain goals more morally acceptable than others? Is ‘spite’ a negative way to channel your aspirations to do better? This section focuses on how to aspire out of both positive and negative situations, and understanding that things happen ‘for’ us, not ‘to’ us.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2 contains chapters about Realisation, the second stage of The Purpose Cycle. </strong>Realisation is about looking internally to find your true self. We always present a framed version of ourselves to the people we spend time with, some may be closer to your true self than others.

The Purpose Cycle: Unlock the Secrets to Success is a tool to help improve your life by embarking on a self-improvement journey through five key stages.My name is Jonathon Tucker and I am the author of The Purpose Cycle. I wrote this book because as a teacher, I love to inspire people every single day. I see how words, thoughts, ideas and dreams mould the person that we become. But is it ever too late to find a new aspiration? Can you become even more successful than you already are?My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover your Purpose. In this book, I hope to instil in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the everlasting journey of self-improvement. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you supersede your wildest dreams, and sit there in your elder years reflecting on everything that you’ve accomplished, rather than disdainfully look back on all what could’ve been.In this book, you'll learn about manifesting and realising your goals. You'll hear stories such as...
my journey to find purpose across three timelines in my life
how to think internally to acknowledge your weaknesses and turn them into strengths
how others found their purpose through the most difficult situations in their lives
 You will love this book if you love to study personal development, aspire to become your greatest self, and you want to become fulfilled with your dream life.The Purpose Cycle is a nonfiction book that speaks to young professionals and aspiring people who want to look at their purpose and their careers in a new way. The Book - The Purpose Cycle: Unlock the secrets to success
The book is written in 5 parts:Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters all about Aspiration. This section looks at how people begin to dream onto bigger things in life. How are aspirations formed? Are certain goals more morally acceptable than others? Is ‘spite’ a negative way to channel your aspirations to do better? This section focuses on how to aspire out of both positive and negative situations, and understanding that things happen ‘for’ us, not ‘to’ us.Part 2 contains chapters about Realisation, the second stage of The Purpose Cycle. Realisation is about looking internally to find your true self. We always present a framed version of ourselves to the people we spend time with, some may be closer to your true self than others. The realisation phase explores how your past experiences and upbringing has shaped you, and uncovers some home truths that will stand you in good stead to move on, and truly develop as a person.Part 3 contains chapters about Initiation. The hardest step in any journey is the first one. This section helps readers take the leap of faith with a series of stories, analysis and tasks designed to rid you of the impostor syndrome, the ‘what if?’ questions apart from one - What if you didn’t take this opportunity? What if you’re sat at the end of your life regretting everything that you didn’t try?Part 4 contains chapters about Creation. This is the day to day life that you want to create for yourself. To realise a dream, you have to life in that reality first. Each day you spend becoming your future self, you must cast votes for what it is you want to become. This section highlights the various choices that you must make on the road to success.Part 5 contains chapters about the final step of The Purpose Cycle: Fruition. Over weeks, months and years of consistency your hard work pays off. They say that you reap what you sow, and this applies to life. Once you bask in your accomplishments, a new fire ignites: the next aspiration, a new Purpose Cycle. What I Need & What You'll Get

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Hidden Threads</i> is a collection of non-fiction essays exploring beyond the black and white views of key technology, business and political issues.<br/><br/>My name is Chris Hsiang and I am the author of <i>Hidden Threads</i>. I wrote this book because I care about the big systemic problems we face in society today (like climate change, wealth inequality and discrimination) and I crave more meaningful conversations for all of us instead of the arguing and name-calling. I believe that by examining how we form our beliefs and understanding more about systems, we will be better able to address these problems as leaders and as individuals in our society.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will have a deeper understanding of the power, wonder and the flaws of our current systems. I hope to inspire a renewed appreciation of questions, not just as a tool to get information but as a way to engage people and to excavate your own and others' beliefs. I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for unraveling difficult topics. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you have meaningful conversations on topics around social change and get past the black and white thinking about important issues we face today.<br/><br/>Some fun topics I explore include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How fiction/stories fill a void and impact our reality</li>
<li>The illusions created by the overflow of information</li>
<li>Our economy of desire</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Some questions I tackle include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we create a shared vision of the greater good in a diverse and complex society? How do we find a mutual purpose?</li>
<li>If agreement of a majority is not enough for peace in a nation, what will be enough?</li>
<li>How do we get our ideas of who the typical American is? The typical Texan? The typical Chinese? The typical Middle Easterner?</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>You will love this book if you want to move past black and white thinking in our social and political dialogue, if you want to dive deeper into the systemic problems we face, or if you are someone that loves exploring big ideas about humanity.<br/><br/><i>Hidden Threads</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to leaders who want new perspective on our systemic problems and people who want to engage more deeply with each other about social, political, tech, business topics and explore our humanity in a new way.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book - Hidden Threads</h3>
<p><br/>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> dives into how our information, our perceptions and beliefs are tied together. The availability and overflow of information has created their own illusions. Facts are understood not in a vacuum but within a larger context. Much of that context consist of our beliefs and stories. We explore the role of information in our beliefs.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> is a view of our world as systems upon systems. I explore how systems thinking is necessary for our social evolution and to help us untangle the systemic problems we face. I also take a look at technology’s role in systems and how technology has both the power to disrupt or to cement systems further. <br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> shines the light on our society. I highlight some conversations we need to be having at all levels from what it means to be a majority, the responsibility of power, and how we should explore further how we as individuals fit into the collective community. </p>

<h3>English Major Goes Galactic</h3>
<p>One day, I decided to ""take a gap year"" from uni and work on a farm. During the transition in 2011, I began channeling. Thinking it was angels from the Spirit World, would you know the communicators look like ETs!</p>
<p>My mission is to transmit energy dynamics, teach esoteric knowledge and help starseeds on Earth release terror involving extraterrestrial and/or human contact.</p>
<p>The free online channelings are helping make sense of The Shift, every month, the past eight years.</p>
<p>Dozens of traditional publishers (from local houses to the esoteric society at the UN) have rejected the idea that sovereign, ninja-turtle-like beings exist! However, the clairvoyants in the room see them holographically floating above my head.</p>
<p>I have spent hundreds of hard-earned dollars sending proposals and getting rejected over and over. Local crystal shops won't even look at self-published material as they prefer to sell popular, pre-approved New Age material. My stuff is next level <i>underground</i>!</p>
<p>Healers see that it is in my soul contract to teach others giving these transmissions to our planet Earth and I need to do my cosmic job.</p>
<p>Help support these benevolent Ascension guides! 64% of Americans already believe in extraterrestrial life, so let's go deeper into their teachings.</p>
<p>We can figure out <i>why</i> they are communicating Ancient Egyptian symbols and words. The Andromedan symbols channeled in 2014 were on a <i>sarcophagus</i> at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, NYC, in 2018! Let's open our third eye more and learn what a wavelength pulse is and configure some energy science!</p>

<h3>By Purchasing the Perk, You Get a Signed Book!</h3>
<p>To create this text, which usually takes 8 months, here's what is needed to get it to you faster:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1000 to pay the artist for the excellent quality cover artwork</li>
<li>$2000 to transcribe 4 years worth of channeled material to keep readers up-to-date</li>
<li>$500 to edit the language of approximately 300 pages/margins/front-back-spine, create a glossary, create an alphabetized index, introduction, rights pages and so on</li>
<li>$1500+ to order and check the proof, then order book copies, pay for the shipping materials &amp; handling of the books, sign them individually and ship to each happy customer worldwide</li>

<h3>How You Are Helping</h3>
<p>When you join the list of contributors, you're building the Orion Council tribe.</p>
<p>You're grounding in <strong>the third book of a timeless channeling series</strong> to the planet, kind of like how Jane Roberts channeled <i>The Seth Material</i> and Carla Rueckert made<i> The Ra Material</i>.</p>
<p>This is the Orion Council Material, where people get to study occult wisdom from the comfort of their own home, at their own unique pace.</p>
<p>In typing up the transcription, my palm chakras light up and tend to get hot. This is why the OC calls these books, ""books of light."" People can feel their energy through the pages.</p>
<p>As the following grows, who knows, maybe we'll be like <i>Abraham</i> and channel together on a cruise ship. This is still the beginning! <i>Bashar</i> fans <i>KNOW</i>!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>My typing speed is super fast, but there are some risks involved. In 2014, I began getting carpal tunnel symptoms and had to use a handbrace, while getting attacked by internet misogynists.</p>
<p>Since then, I've discovered organic sulfur which helped remove 90% of bodily symptoms and made some mind-altering rap songs, but it doesn't prevent skeptics, The Cabal or trolls from trying their best.</p>
<p>I also work on the side by running an online school and create handmade wellness/art products for my shop, so time is limited.</p>
<p>To keep the channelings going, I have to create free videos every week without benefactors, etc.</p>

This book will teach you how to start building your credit the right way. Learn what it takes to set yourself up for financial freedom and enjoy all the benefits an excellent credit and the correct cards have to offer.<br/><br/>My name is Lucciano Diaz-Skoff, and I am the author of Freedom In Credit Cards. My fascination to debunk the best practices to build and restore credit started with a harsh “NO,” and getting denied by my local bank for my first mortgage.<br/>Everything began when I headed to the bank with the hopes of buying my own place to call home and then getting rejected due to my credit score or rather the absence of it.<br/><br/>I wrote this book because of a lack of education and misconceptions around credit and credit cards.<br/><br/>After years of hard work and saving up for this moment, a simple “No” destroyed my dreams of achieving this milestone. That is why I sat down with my new goal of learning all I can about credit to not go throughout this again.<br/><br/>In this journey of learning and recollecting important information, the more people I met up with and talked about credit, the more I realized that this is not a topic people want to talk about. They are just not used to talking about their financial situation openly. Furthermore, we only begin to learn about credit when taking out a loan or through our parents when they give you a credit card, which is not a great source of information. Although, the one thing that people do not tell you is that your credit cards, especially your credit, are tools that can open up a world of possibilities. These opportunities are usually not available to you with cash.<br/><br/>In reading this book, you will discover how to build your credit the right way and take advantage of all the perks and features of credit cards. I hope to instill within you the same passion and excitement that I have for credit and credit cards. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as the best tool to help you start your financial freedom journey.<br/><br/>In this book, you’ll learn about what credit is and how we use it nowadays:</p><ul>
<li>How credit has evolved through time, and how it impacts our life now</li>
<li>How to start building credit and get approved for your first FOUR (4) credit cards</li>
<li>How credit works and how you can begin your journey to financial freedom</li>
</ul><p>You will love this book if you are building your credit, or you already have experience with credit cards and want to learn something new.<br/>Freedom In Credit Cards is a non-fiction book that speaks to those looking to start building credit and are going to be first time users of credit cards. And to those card holders who already have experience, I hope you can learn new information and access insights on how to get their next card.</p><p> </p><h3>The Book - Freedom in Credit Cards</h3><p><br/>The book is written in nine parts...<br/><br/>In the introduction, you will find my personal story of how I got denied the chance of buying a home, and how that changed the way I view credit. You will also read about the emotions associated with money and credit cards. Throughout the book, you will learn about the hidden scripts and misconceptions that surround credit cards.<br/><br/>In chapter one, you will learn about the credit card game. What is the game, what are the rules of the game, and how do you play it to WIN. You will also learn about how to manage your credit score, and all the variables it entails.<br/><br/>In chapter two, you will learn what credit is, when it started, and how we use it today. Lastly, we will go over the steps to start building credit the right way!<br/><br/>In chapter three, I will share three things with you. We’ll start by learning how to get approved for your FIRST (1st) credit card.<br/>After you’ve achieved this, we’ll go over how to set yourself up for your SECOND (2nd) credit card! We’ll then finish by diving into the insights of how your credit score fluctuates each time you obtain a new card.<br/><br/>Once you get your second card, chapter four will teach you how to choose your third and fourth card. Furthermore, you will have the tools and knowledge to keep building your credit.<br/><br/>In chapter five, you will learn things not commonly known for credit cards. An example of this is how a loan, a mortgage, and buying a car affects your credit score differently. You will also learn how paying off debt, like student loans, impact your credit score directly.<br/><br/>Chapter six will talk about credit cards for business. How they work, how to get them, and how they can be a tool of growth for you and your business. You will also learn how they differ from personal credit cards and the types of enterprises that can apply to them.<br/><br/>Chapter seven will teach you how to negotiate with banks. You will learn about the things you can and should negotiate directly with your bank and how to do it. You will also find examples of scripts for disputing a late payment or a hard inquiry.<br/><br/>Financial Freedom. The last chapter will discuss the tools you have gained and what you have learned while setting yourself up for your financial freedom, starting with your credit cards.</p><p> </p><h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3><p><br/>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

</ul><p> </p><h3>About the Author</h3><p><br/>I wrote this book due to my passion for credit and credit cards, impacting the lives of current and future credit card users. I believe in the power credit has and how it can help us achieve our financial freedom.<br/><br/>My name is Lucciano Diaz-Skoff. I am an avid inventor and quirky engineer; this means I love my beard. I am also an entrepreneur, and I’ve built things that improve &amp; optimize the lives of those around me.<br/><br/>At 21 years of age, I founded with my brother, the first youth-led nonprofit organization for aspiring entrepreneurs in Puerto Rico. At 23, I led a team of engineers to build a solar-powered car and race it across Texas. When I turned 25, I led a team of first responders and volunteers to gather last-mile intelligence from all 78 Mayors, post-Hurricane Maria. At age 26, I filed my first patent. By 27, I was a patent holder. Now at 28, I’m publishing Freedom In Credit Cards.<br/><br/>When not hard at work, I enjoy drawing and designing new products and solutions for everyday use. I am also passionate about supporting small and medium businesses with a local non-profit foundation and starting new ventures. I make time to read, learn, teach, and explore new ideas and concepts of personal finance and financial freedom.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Lucciano at Luccianodiazskoff@gmail.com, and <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/LuccianoDiazSkoff"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lucciano Diaz-Skoff</a> at <a href=""http://www.instagram.com/luccianodiazskoff/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a>, <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/lucciano.diaz.9"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a>, and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/luccianodiazskoff/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LinkedIn</a>.</p><p> </p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p> </p><p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.</p><p> </p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p> </p><p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p><ul>

 About the AuthorI wrote this book due to my passion for credit and credit cards, impacting the lives of current and future credit card users. I believe in the power credit has and how it can help us achieve our financial freedom.My name is Lucciano Diaz-Skoff. I am an avid inventor and quirky engineer; this means I love my beard. I am also an entrepreneur, and I’ve built things that improve & optimize the lives of those around me.At 21 years of age, I founded with my brother, the first youth-led nonprofit organization for aspiring entrepreneurs in Puerto Rico. At 23, I led a team of engineers to build a solar-powered car and race it across Texas. When I turned 25, I led a team of first responders and volunteers to gather last-mile intelligence from all 78 Mayors, post-Hurricane Maria. At age 26, I filed my first patent. By 27, I was a patent holder. Now at 28, I’m publishing Freedom In Credit Cards.When not hard at work, I enjoy drawing and designing new products and solutions for everyday use. I am also passionate about supporting small and medium businesses with a local non-profit foundation and starting new ventures. I make time to read, learn, teach, and explore new ideas and concepts of personal finance and financial freedom.For more information, you can connect with Lucciano at Luccianodiazskoff@gmail.com, and Lucciano Diaz-Skoff at Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn. Risks & Challenges The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship. Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:
Please share my Pre-sale Campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network. Please use #FreedomInCreditCards and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press so we can help amplify your efforts.
You can easily share my Pre-Sale Campaign Page via Indiegogo at the top of the page

<p>Books that inspires adventure, curiosity, and conservation through an intelligent, knowledgeable, and loveable guide...demand more from your children's books, demand more from your travel books.</p>
<p>Why Ricky's adventures are more engaging than a honey craving bear or an English wizard or an automobile association rating:</p>
<p>- Magical adventures in real places: Great photos, witty commentary</p>
<p>- A little knowledge: fun facts and challenging vocabulary (in a good way)</p>
<p>- Genuine advice from an experienced traveler (send Ricky an email and get feedback from his travels, really)</p>
<p> Whatever direction and magnitude you foresee Ricky following, multiply that by 10, square it, and apply that vector to every direction...Ricky's interests and passion for travel fall somewhere between ""Epic"" and ""Legendary"", so help him along since something great could be in the near future.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>A running joke between two friends (getting the best Ricky pictures) turned into a way to stay close when one of the friends got seriously sick. During Ricky's travels, his story resonated with families, seniors, and veterans; something about a little raccoon making the most of the big world attracted their attention and led them to share their own stories. When Ricky's ""solo"" adventures were immortalized on paper as a ""get well"" present, he also attracted the attention of the neighborhood kids...that's when the light bulb went off.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>This campaign is to help a small company make the big leap from the digital world to real, tangible media. Realizing that kids do not interact with iPads the way they do with real books, we realized we had to make a big leap (and that's where you come in). The money raised in this campaign will be used to support the following activities:</p>
<ol start=""1"">
<li>
<strong>Ebook to real book</strong> - Work with the Publish on Demand services to transition from the current iBook format to real, paperback media...to make something real</li>
<li>
<strong>Distribution</strong> - Even the greatest idea is meaningless if no one knows about it, so marketing and distributing the book will be the next step after publication</li>
<li>
<strong>Website </strong>- Ricky's got wisdom and style, but that takes money to translate into a website. On this budget, it will still be a modest website for certain, but better than what we could learn in a reasonable amount of time</li>
</ol><p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>A few inspired, hard-working people can only take a project so far. Nights/weekends freely given, monetary investments of what we could...but that's not quite enough.</p>
<p>Transitioning to real book shelves is both costly and difficult. Print-On-Demand service help lower the barrier to entry, but there are layout, proofing, and printing costs. Once physical books are produced, marketing the title to different bookstores and reviewers are not insignificant costs. We have the determination, but the capital is hurting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>Trigger Warning</i> is a poetry book designed to show anyone out there who is going through a rough patch that there is always someone out there who understands and can help them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Harley Vaughn and I am the author of <i>Trigger Warning</i>. I wrote this book because I, along with many others around me, have battled depression and abuse in my past. I never had the courage to ask for the help I needed, so I am sharing my voice to push others to talk about what is going on in their lives and to seek recovery.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that though you feel alone or lost, there are others out there who have been through these battles as well. You will also find that it is possible to get help and get better. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for reaching out. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you find your voice and reach out to those around you for the help you need.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this book, you'll learn about personal battles and seeking recovery:</p>
<ul>
<li>Love and Loss and how they can contribute in the downward spiral of our mental health</li>
<li>Depression, sexual and physical assault, along with other battles, and how it changes our outlooks on life</li>
<li>Finding the courage to say that you are not okay and how to go about recovering</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you have dealt, are dealing, or know someone who has had these issues in their life. <i>Trigger Warning</i> is a poetry book that speaks to teens and young adults who are looking at depression and recovery for the first time.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Book - <i>Trigger Warning</i>
</h2>
<p>The book is written in 4 Parts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Part 1 contains the introduction and Poems 1-5. In the introduction, I share how I personally battled through depression and suicidal tendencies, and how I sought recovery multiple times. These chapters will also show you love and how it can be the start of your mental downfall. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Part 2 contains Poems 6-15. These are based around heartbreak. The reader will learn how heartbreak and personal battles can go hand-in-hand as well as how relationships tend to fall apart when you are in a very bad mental state.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Part 3 contains Poems 16-51. This part of the book will look into personal battles such as depression, sexual and physical abuse, alcoholism, eating disorders, rape, and more. It will both educate readers on the dangers and struggles of these issues as well as show them that they are not alone in the things that they are going through or have gone through. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Part 4 contains Poems 52-70 and a hotline page. The last section of the book is constructed of tips on how to get through the recovery process, as well as including reminders and positive notes on how recovery is always possible, even after a relapse.  It is designed to really push the audience to seek help among their peers. The back of the book also includes a page full of hotlines, in case someone needs help, but feels that they cannot reach out to those around them.</p>

<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>

<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>Roller derby changes lives. That might sound a little dramatic, but it does. The young girls who play roller derby get it, because the roller derby community is one of the most diverse, accepting, empowering girl power environments on the planet. Dorothy's Derby Chronicles was created to give that same dose of derby spirit and ""be yourself"" to all girls across the world.  You don't have to play to have it.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I’m Meghan Dougherty, aka Undertaker’s Daughter with the Rocky Mountain Rollergirls. Alece Birnbach is a nationally licensed illustrator, and we are the creators of the Dorothy’s Derby Chronicles book series for tween-aged girls (and boys). After playing roller derby for just a year and seeing the transformations of confidence in the women I skated with, we decided the heart, strength, diversity, independence and self-confidence needed to be shared with all young girls through a fun book.  </span><br/></p>

<p>Roller derby is the back drop for a funny, action-packed adventure about loving who you are and reaching for your dreams as a team. The first book, Rise of the Undead Redhead, came out July 1, 2015, and is about Dorothy (aka Undead Red); the second book, Woe of Jade Doe, is about Jade (aka Jade Doe), and comes out spring 2015; and the third book, Booty Vicious Bites Back, is our fierce, sassy sweetheart--Gigi.</p>

<p></p>
<h3></h3>
<p>We have self-funded the development of the first two books.  As you may know, unknown authors do not get much of an advance, which they also must pay back before receiving any royalties, and then after that they receive only a small percentage on each book since the publisher pays for all of the printing and distribution.  On a $6.99 book, it's going to be a while. This campaign is specifically funding our co-writer and illustrator helpers for the third book in the series, Booty Vicious Bites Back.  We could use your help.</p>
<p>This third book is the most diverse book in the series so far, as we gain momentum with Book 1.  One of a kind, the Dorothy's Derby Chronicles series celebrates being yourself and laughing at yourself through a sport that has mastered it.  We need your help to knock this third book out.  Then we can focus on the first two books, school visits and instilling derby attitude into all girls.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">What we need and what you'll get</b><br/></p>
</div><div> <p></p>
<h3></h3>
<p>We are asking for $5,000 to pay for our co-writer and supporting illustrator to get the 3rd book ready to go.  Books in a series have to be timed within close to six months of each other so you are writing the next book before the previous is even out. That doesn't cover our Indeigogo fees or shipping, but we want to make the campaign achievable. </p>
<p>We are thanking our donors with love, perhaps a copy of the first book--Rise of the Undead Redhead--art from the book, tattoos, decals, bracelets and all sorts of cool schwag. You could even have YOUR name in the next book!  If we don't reach our entire goal, still every penny will still go to create the third book.  And it all helps.  </p>
<p><b>Stretch Goals</b></p>
<p>If we make $500 over it will pay for Indiegogo fees and shipping.  If we make $1,000 more, it will go toward creating a video profiling junior skaters and highlighting the confidence they have achieved.  Any more will help us travel to more schools to talk about the importance of loving your body, and of course, loving roller derby.  Our next goal is to fulfill our dreams of creating an app and turning the first book into a graphic novel style format.  Here's a pic of me showing my derby confidence...or faux derby scariness.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/953588/files/20141023074525-bwohyeahpose.jpg?1414075525"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>This series, like the sport of roller derby, celebrates girls of every shape and size.

</div></div>","Summary
Roller derby changes lives. That might sound a little dramatic, but it does. The young girls who play roller derby get it, because the roller derby community is one of the most diverse, accepting, empowering girl power environments on the planet. Dorothy's Derby Chronicles was created to give that same dose of derby spirit and ""be yourself"" to all girls across the world.  You don't have to play to have it.
I’m Meghan Dougherty, aka Undertaker’s Daughter with the Rocky Mountain Rollergirls. Alece Birnbach is a nationally licensed illustrator, and we are the creators of the Dorothy’s Derby Chronicles book series for tween-aged girls (and boys). After playing roller derby for just a year and seeing the transformations of confidence in the women I skated with, we decided the heart, strength, diversity, independence and self-confidence needed to be shared with all young girls through a fun book.  
Check out this video of junior roller derby athletes talking about how the sport has changed them. 
Roller derby is the back drop for a funny, action-packed adventure about loving who you are and reaching for your dreams as a team. The first book, Rise of the Undead Redhead, came out July 1, 2015, and is about Dorothy (aka Undead Red); the second book, Woe of Jade Doe, is about Jade (aka Jade Doe), and comes out spring 2015; and the third book, Booty Vicious Bites Back, is our fierce, sassy sweetheart--Gigi.



We have self-funded the development of the first two books.  As you may know, unknown authors do not get much of an advance, which they also must pay back before receiving any royalties, and then after that they receive only a small percentage on each book since the publisher pays for all of the printing and distribution.  On a $6.99 book, it's going to be a while. This campaign is specifically funding our co-writer and illustrator helpers for the third book in the series, Booty Vicious Bites Back.  We could use your help.
This third book is the most diverse book in the series so far, as we gain momentum with Book 1.  One of a kind, the Dorothy's Derby Chronicles series celebrates being yourself and laughing at yourself through a sport that has mastered it.  We need your help to knock this third book out.  Then we can focus on the first two books, school visits and instilling derby attitude into all girls.

What we need and what you'll get
 

We are asking for $5,000 to pay for our co-writer and supporting illustrator to get the 3rd book ready to go.  Books in a series have to be timed within close to six months of each other so you are writing the next book before the previous is even out. That doesn't cover our Indeigogo fees or shipping, but we want to make the campaign achievable. 
We are thanking our donors with love, perhaps a copy of the first book--Rise of the Undead Redhead--art from the book, tattoos, decals, bracelets and all sorts of cool schwag. You could even have YOUR name in the next book!  If we don't reach our entire goal, still every penny will still go to create the third book.  And it all helps.  
Stretch Goals
If we make $500 over it will pay for Indiegogo fees and shipping.  If we make $1,000 more, it will go toward creating a video profiling junior skaters and highlighting the confidence they have achieved.  Any more will help us travel to more schools to talk about the importance of loving your body, and of course, loving roller derby.  Our next goal is to fulfill our dreams of creating an app and turning the first book into a graphic novel style format.  Here's a pic of me showing my derby confidence...or faux derby scariness.

  The Impact This series, like the sport of roller derby, celebrates girls of every shape and size. We believe girls need more role models who have the confidence to say ""Hey, I don't care what you think about me."" Just think about how long it took you to find that confidence...or maybe you need to join a roller derby league!
Our first book is getting positive reviews, from the industry and from readers of all ages, with comments like ""Where was this book when I was growing up!""  
  Risks & Challenges Our biggest risk is having to take longer to fund and finish the third book.  We don't know if we will have a publisher for the third book yet (they've optioned it, but not yet confirmed), so there is a chance we'll have to publish it ourselves.  But we are committed to doing what it takes to get Booty Vicious' story on the tween reader track!

  Other Ways You Can Help Even if you can't give, it helps us when you share this project and campaign with others.  The Indiegogo sharing tools are incredible.  Thank you so much for all your support.",2.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>The What?</h3>
<p>We are the team of literature passionates responsible for Fabledo - a platform allowing independent short story writers to publish their fiction. </p>
<p><span>We believe that the short story as a literary form has never received the appropriate credit. There is hardly any way </span><span>an independent author can publish a single short story and make some money. Even well-known authors will </span><span>often have trouble getting an agent to deal with a single piece of short fiction.

<p>There are, of course, places online where you can get audio short stories. However, Fabledo is unique in how much it puts emphasis of what is well written and interesting. We will never aim for quantity and always try to make sure that the stories we publish are actually enjoyable.</p>
<p>Now, we want to be unique in one more way - we want to be<em> free</em>. This is the plan: to offer all our stories for no cost at all, and <em>still</em> pay royalties to our authors.</p>
<p>Your funding will help us make Fabledo free, more widely available, and more importantly - promote the short story as a literary genre. </p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Later on we will still need to support the site and record more stories. In order to do that, we'll place advertismetns on the page. BUT we will never make them intrusive or annoying. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Here's What We'll Do with the Money</h3>
<p>There are three places the funds will go (+one optional):</p>
<p>1. Currently to download an audio book from Fabledo it is necessary to go through a billing procedure - even in the case of the free stories.</p>
<p>Now, our system will be redesigned so that the stories will be available to listen to directly on the homepage for free (with a possibility to download the mp3s, also for free!) - 30%</p>
<p>2. Making Fabledo available on mobile devices - creating applications for the major mobile OS'es (iOS, Android, Windows Phone) that will synchronize This will be outsourced for another 30%</p>
<p>3. The remaining 40% will be used for recording, mixing and illustrating another batch of short stories.</p>
<p>Optional: 4. If we get suffictient funds over our goal, we will introduce an accounts system allowing for personalization, like favoriting certain stories and getting rid of all ads for a small monthly fee.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What's in it for You?</strong></p>
<p>Since our products will already be free for everyone, there isn't that much we can offer our supporters! Still, we'll try hard to do that. As you can see on the perks list, you get the following:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>$2 - Thank you so much!</p>
<p>$10 - lots of our gratitude. But wait... there's more! A Thank You email and a coupon code to download a free story! The code is not in the perks list because we can't change the description now that somebody bought it already, but it's what you get!</p>
<p>$30 - a code to get three our current stories for free, right <em>now, </em>AND the gratitude.</p>
<p>$60 - you will additionally get a hand written postcard anywhere in the world. You will get 50 impressions of your commercial ad and the promo code you'll receive will enable you to download ALL of the current stories for free.</p>
<p>$100 - the code, the gratitude, 100 free impressions of your  advertisement AND the lifetime ad-free account (if we raise enough funds for the accounts system!)</p>
<p>$400 - the code, the gratitude, 500 free impressions, the ad-free account AND getting mentioned on our About Us page</p>
<p> $1000 - Much as we'd like to offer you one of our female team members to wed, they weren't too thrilled about the idea. We really don't know why. So we had to skip this perk...</p>

<div>
<h3>Is that all...?</h3>
<p>In addition to the above perks, you'll get a huge amout of satisfaction that will be proportinoal to the value of the perk you choose. Cheesy though it may sound, you will really make a difference and help enable some great fiction to get out there. Thats <em>worth</em> it!</p>
<p>Any fan of literature will know that short stories are not just shorter/inferior novels - they are a separate genre that has special charm on its own.

<strong>WHO AM I?</strong>
<p>              I am Brenda Marie Smith.  I wrote my first story when I was five years old about a girl named Wendy who could fly on the winds.  I conceived the whole story while standing at the apex of my swing-set and letting the Oklahoma wind try to carry me away.  It damned near did.</p>
<p>             Now I’ve written a book to share, <em>Something Radiates.</em>  I’m a mother, grandmother, and wife (of a cutie-pie hunky husband) in Austin, Texas.  I do accounting and taxes part-time, help my family run a couple of green businesses, and write, write, write.</p>
<p>             An early draft of <em>Something Radiates</em> was a finalist in a Writers League of Texas novel contest in the Science Fiction category. I have studied fiction in the UCLA Writers Program under published novelists Caroline Leavitt, Roberta Morris, and Dennis Foley, screenwriter Terry Borst, and nonfiction writer Nancy Shepherdson.  I have also been privately tutored by Austin playwright and biographer Anita Howard and Virginia editor/writer David H. Morgan.  I have been actively involved in two writers groups over several years.</p>
<p>             In 2012 I participated in NaNoWriMo and in one month completed 50,800 words for a new novel – as yet untitled – of a post-apocalyptic sort.  I also have a sequel to <em>Something Radiates</em> in the works, <em>Reality Resonates. </em> I plan to finish both of these novels within the next year.</p>
<p>             In the past seven years I have read more than 2,000 books.  I love good books, and I think you will find that <em>Something Radiates </em>is a good book worthy of your support.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHY DO I NEED $4,000 FOR MY BOOK?</strong> </p>
<p>             The book will be published by CreateSpace, an affiliate of Amazon.com. Their fee includes the cover, interior design, formatting for e-readers, ISBN numbers, and a limited amount of marketing that will make the book more available to most US bookstores.  The book is being copy-edited by well-known Austin writer and editor, Cindy Widner, a real pro. </p>
<p>             The remaining money will pay for my website, a business bank account, funding fees, books to mail to potential reviewers, and some inexpensive marketing and networking costs.  Most of the marketing will be done by me with social networking and I hope by word of mouth from my readers and friends.  You can help me go viral, right?  I know you can.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>MORE ABOUT <em>SOMETHING RADIATES</em></strong></p>
<p><em>             Something Radiates</em> is a genre-bending paranormal thriller about a single mother’s struggle to wrench control of her life away from a madman.   </p>
<p><em>             From lusty swamp romps to dream invasions and psychic battles of will, this mother’s quest for survival and love will yank you from the psychedelic fringes of nirvana to demented stalker hell and back</em><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>            Telepathic dreamer </em><em>Sarah Stevens worked for fourteen years to build the courage to leave her cruel husband Dietrich Peters, and four more years to build a life for her and her two teenage sons in sultry Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  Just as Sarah meets a good man she could fall in love with in a heartbeat, Dietrich barges back into her life, and Sarah is not about to put up with it.</em></p>
<p><em>            But Dietrich will not be deterred.  He invades her home, her dreams, her mind, and grows more threatening with each passing hour.  Sarah defends her family and freedom tenaciously but soon has trouble separating the emotional turmoil dredged up by Dietrich from the increasingly terrifying reality that suddenly engulfs her.</em></p>
<p><em>          Sarah must revisit her abused past, learn new psychic skills, and summon all her untapped mental and spiritual resources for the fight of her life.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>HOW YOU CAN HELP</strong></p>
<p>             For $20-25 you can get a copy of <em>Something Radiates</em> as soon as it’s printed (estimated two to three months after funding).  For more money you can get autographs, more copies, and other extra perks all the way up to dinner with the author in Austin paid for by me.  But if you can’t afford the $20-$25, you can still get an autograph for $5.  All donors get listed on my website and Facebook page unless they choose not to be listed.</p>
<p>             And if you can’t contribute money at all, I get it completely.  If you would please spread the word and get your friends and relations to contribute and/or to buy the book, you will have the undying gratitude of me and my fairly large family, and that is something worth having. If you let me know you’re helping spread the word, I’ll list you on the website and Facebook page too.</p>
<p>             Thanks so much for your interest and support.  Look for updates on the novel at my spanking new website: <a href=""http://brendamariesmith.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://brendamariesmith.com/</a>.   </p>

Once a week, we meet to write, write more and write better, and be in each other’s company. Led by myself, Celine, C.H.U.M.P.S. originated from a creative writing program hosted at a homeless shelter and since then has become a fiercely loyal group who has supported each other not only in writing but all the bumpy elements of life.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Our Anthology</h3>
<p>I've compiled, edited, and designed an anthology that collects the best of our work. It's a tangible marker of C.H.U.M.P.S.' accomplishment, and once put on the shelves of Calgary's independent bookstores is a huge and hopeful signature of street poetry and its value in our literary scene.

<p>The fundraiser goal of $1,040 includes all printing and production costs for 200 copies of the anthology, taking into account poster promotion and extra processing fees. We'll be selling these at our book launch and reading on August 30th at Shelf Life Books.

Any extra funds raised will go straight to the poets. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What your support says</h3>
<p>When you sponsor our anthology, you're joining a movement. Sure, it sounds trendy and hyperbolized. But it's true, and here's why: you're saying homelessness does not define people, as writers or as people, and its stigma and stereotypes should not hold sway on how we read, listen to, and see others. You're saying that the creative spirit is innate and bright and its electricity is worth lighting up in <i>anyone</i> no matter how much baggage (literally or metaphorically) is attached. The point is that this goes farther than a few dollars, or a few hundred. It goes farther than a book. This is just a concrete way of participation in an ongoing push to open up ourselves, our consciousness and our spaces to stories that discomfit us, nudge us into empathy, and help us realize our capacity for feeling. And for change.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Don't got no dolla dolla bills y'all?</h3>
<p>Don't worry, we understand. You can still share this campaign like crazy, hype our reading event, invite friends, and attend with mad respect and a listening ear. </p></span></span></span></div>","Meet the C.H.U.M.P.S.,

But it's true, and here's why: you're saying homelessness does not define people, as writers or as people, and its stigma and stereotypes should not hold sway on how we read, listen to, and see others. You're saying that the creative spirit is innate and bright and its electricity is worth lighting up in anyone no matter how much baggage (literally or metaphorically) is attached. The point is that this goes farther than a few dollars, or a few hundred. It goes farther than a book. This is just a concrete way of participation in an ongoing push to open up ourselves, our consciousness and our spaces to stories that discomfit us, nudge us into empathy, and help us realize our capacity for feeling. And for change.


Don't got no dolla dolla bills y'all?

You bathe your weary bones in scalding hot water, eat a generous dinner, and then slip into futons by 8 p.m. It's a damn fine way to walk the world with good friends.

</div><h3>¿Qué?</h3><b>La virtud de ese amuleto</b> es la historia de un gran 
amor, pero también es un relato de batallas personales y de conquistas; 
de sueños cumplidos y de valor. De la lucha de Carmen Alicia por lograr 
su libertad y así poder vivir su amor.<br/><blockquote>
<p><b>La virtud de ese amuleto </b>narra las tribulaciones de una mujer 
dispuesta a escapar de una terrible cárcel moral e intelectual. La de su
 casa, su retrógrada madre, su desalmado hermano mayor, y el 
ultraconservador y racista pueblo en el que le tocó nacer, a principios 
del siglo pasado. Además de esto, tiene que salvarse de ser la moneda de
 cambio en un matrimonio pactado por intereses económicos.

</p>
<p>Su desdichada vida da un giro inesperado cuando conoce y se enamora 
de Mandinga; un enigmático individuo de raza negra, de quien se dice en 
la región que es el mismísimo Satanás, y que tiene unos poderes 
sobrenaturales que provienen del deslumbrante amuleto que cuelga sobre 
su pecho.</p>
</blockquote><h3>¿Quiénes?</h3><p><b>Tandaia </b>es
 una joven editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a 
autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes 
ideas como es el <i>crowdfunding</i>. </p><p>De este modo eres tú,

que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro

 en Caracas en 1975. Escritor, Lingüista y epicúreo; es Licenciado en 
Comunicación Audiovisual y Diplomado en Dirección Cinematográfica y 
Realización de Televisión. Su currículum académico también incluye 
estudios de Derecho (Universidad Complutense de Madrid) y de Máster en 
Formación de Profesorado (Universidad Pontificia Comillas), aún por 
finalizar. En 1998, fue seleccionado por la ilustre Fundación Gran 
Mariscal de Ayacucho de Venezuela, para la concesión de una beca de

amor, pero también es un relato de batallas personales y de conquistas; 
de sueños cumplidos y de valor. De la lucha de Carmen Alicia por lograr 
su libertad y así poder vivir su amor.
La virtud de ese amuleto narra las tribulaciones de una mujer 
dispuesta a escapar de una terrible cárcel moral e intelectual. La de su
 casa, su retrógrada madre, su desalmado hermano mayor, y el 
ultraconservador y racista pueblo en el que le tocó nacer, a principios 
del siglo pasado. Además de esto, tiene que salvarse de ser la moneda de
 cambio en un matrimonio pactado por intereses económicos.


Su desdichada vida da un giro inesperado cuando conoce y se enamora 
de Mandinga; un enigmático individuo de raza negra, de quien se dice en 
la región que es el mismísimo Satanás, y que tiene unos poderes 
sobrenaturales que provienen del deslumbrante amuleto que cuelga sobre 
su pecho.
¿Quiénes?Tandaia es
 una joven editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a 
autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes

 en Caracas en 1975. Escritor, Lingüista y epicúreo; es Licenciado en 
Comunicación Audiovisual y Diplomado en Dirección Cinematográfica y 
Realización de Televisión. Su currículum académico también incluye 
estudios de Derecho (Universidad Complutense de Madrid) y de Máster en 
Formación de Profesorado (Universidad Pontificia Comillas), aún por 
finalizar. En 1998, fue seleccionado por la ilustre Fundación Gran 
Mariscal de Ayacucho de Venezuela, para la concesión de una beca de 
estudios de postgrado en el extranjero. Y así, en 1999, traslada su 
residencia a Madrid, para cursar estudios de Cine, obteniendo en 2002 el
 título de Diplomado que ostenta. En 2003, y tras un intenso y 
fructífero período de residencia en Londres, regresa a Madrid, donde

<h3>About this project </h3>
<p><i><b><a href=""www.nevoazul.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">NEVOAZUL</a> is an independent bi-annual magazine where minimalism, consumerism and sustainability merge with culture, art and literature. The aim is to gratify the readers intellect, stimulating critical thinking about modern society.</b></i></p>
<p></p>
<p>We
live in the age of speed. We strain to be faster than machines, for the sake of
a future that consumes our present. We now buy fast, cheap and in huge
quantity, forgetting about centuries of heritage and wisdom.</p>
<p>But
it doesn’t need to be that way. </p>
<p>We
believe it’s time to give another chance to efficiency, creativity and quality,
instead of over glorifying waste, quantity and compulsory consumerism.</p>
<p></p>
<p>That’s
why we decided to create NEVOAZUL, an independent publication where minimalism,
consumerism and sustainability merge with culture, art and literature. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Every article, photography and drawing is an invitation to a balanced life with more conversations and less shopping, more walks and less anxiety, more knowledge and less information. We want NEVOAZUL magazine to be a knowledge and inspiration haven for those looking for a simple, but significant life.</span></p>
<p><b>This campaign aims at funding the printing and shipping costs of <i>NEVOAZUL'</i>s first issue. The pieces are slotting into place, most of the magazine is ready. We just need some help covering the initial print run and distribution so that you can get NEVOAZUL magazine into your hands by September, 2016. </b></p>

<p>We're confident that we can create a meaningfull publication that you'll enjoy, but the biggest concern on our minds is how to get the printed version in countries outside Europe.

</div></div>","About this project 
NEVOAZUL is an independent bi-annual magazine where minimalism, consumerism and sustainability merge with culture, art and literature. The aim is to gratify the readers intellect, stimulating critical thinking about modern society.

We
live in the age of speed. We strain to be faster than machines, for the sake of
a future that consumes our present. We now buy fast, cheap and in huge
quantity, forgetting about centuries of heritage and wisdom.
But
it doesn’t need to be that way. 
We
believe it’s time to give another chance to efficiency, creativity and quality,
instead of over glorifying waste, quantity and compulsory consumerism.

That’s
why we decided to create NEVOAZUL, an independent publication where minimalism,
consumerism and sustainability merge with culture, art and literature. Every article, photography and drawing is an invitation to a balanced life with more conversations and less shopping, more walks and less anxiety, more knowledge and less information. We want NEVOAZUL magazine to be a knowledge and inspiration haven for those looking for a simple, but significant life.
This campaign aims at funding the printing and shipping costs of NEVOAZUL's first issue. The pieces are slotting into place, most of the magazine is ready. We just need some help covering the initial print run and distribution so that you can get NEVOAZUL magazine into your hands by September, 2016. 




Issue 1 - Impermanence

In a culture motivated by consumerism and memory, the first issue of NEVOAZUL magazine reflects about impermanence as a driven force for a simple, more meaningfull life.


Here's what you will find inside the first issue:

-An article about the benefits of organic cotton in the lives of farmers around the world


-How the ancestral art of Kintsugi turn broken ceramics into objects even more precious than they were before

-Was Albert Einstein a minimalist? An article wrote by Sam Lustgarten from the blog Frugaling

-Paintings by the artist Katte Geneta, where she represents nature fickleness using a single stroke to create a wave

-A  review about the movie Mon Oncle about simplicity and modernity

-A story about the inspiring Aileen Xu, the girl behind the youtube channel Lavendaire

-Three poems about Wittgenstein's silence written by Emanuel Madalena
-The virtues of impermanence online, an article about sharing in the age of Snapchat, a social network where what we share expires in 24 hours

...and many more.

Help us share the word:
#nevoazulmag

We want to create awareness about the impact of compulsory consumerism, waste and environmental problems on our society. Help us spread NEVOAZUL magazine and together we could open a debate about how social responsability, sustainable behavior and ethical fashion could make a difference in our future.


Costs, risks and challenges 

We have carefully assessed the risks, challenges and costs associated with launching a project like NEVOAZUL.
The money we raise via this campaign is dedicated to printing and distribution NEVOAZUL's first issue ""Impermanence"". We need to raise at least 5.000€, enabling us to print 1,000 copies and distribute them. 

One issue of NEVOAZUL will cost — 15€ per issue, that's about 22$ and £15.  We think this is a fair price point, making the publication affordable for readers while enabling us to create more content.
We're confident that we can create a meaningfull publication that you'll enjoy, but the biggest concern on our minds is how to get the printed version in countries outside Europe. Shipping ain't cheap, but with the inclusion of a digital edition, we hope to reach more people in more parts of the world.

As much as there are always risks with print publishing, We have approached this project vigilantly through extensive planning for the last months and we are totally committed to this project.
This project is at an advanced stage of production. Funding is the last step to make this first issue happening.

<p>Tú lo sabes tanto como nosotros: estamos en uno de esos momentos críticos en que las cosas más impensables suceden todos los días y quienes las cometen hacen todo lo posible para ocultarlas y seguirlas cometiendo con impunidad. Decía Al Gore, quien conoce el tema bastante bien: “Si la gente no está informada, no puede pedir cuentas al gobierno cuando es incompetente, corrupto o ambas”.</p>
<p>Aquí es donde entramos nosotros: Desde Julio del 2014 hemos hecho más de 300 investigaciones a profundidad que van desde las donaciones de Odebrecht a campañas de políticos tanto de oposición como oficialistas en Venezuela, los <i>Panama Papers</i> o la serie sobre el colapso del sistema público de salud. Hace unos días, ganamos el segundo lugar en el Premio Latinoamericano de Periodismo de Investigación 2017, otorgado por IPYS, por nuestra serie ”Outsourcing militar” acerca de como los uniformados han conquistado los contratos e importaciones multimillonarias del Estado,</p>
<p>Queremos ampliar nuestro trabajo, incrementando el número de crónicas que  publicamos por semana y generando un concurso entre periodistas de investigación latinoamericanos para desarrollar historias de alcance regional como la serie sobre <i>Lava Jato </i>(el entramado de corrupción entre empresas brasileras y políticos corruptos que involucra 12 países, entre ellos Venezuela y, al menos, 6 ex-presidentes). </p>
<p>Entendiendo que cada una involucra al menos dos meses de trabajo, invitamos a financiar un día de trabajo, dos, una semana o hasta una historia completa. Vemos esta campaña como una oportunidad para que miles de venezolanos elevemos nuestra voz, en un momento tan crítico de opacidad e impunidad y revelemos en conjunto lo que poderosos sin escrúpulos quieren ocultar</p>
</div><h3>Financia una investigación</h3><div>
<p>En cada una de las investigaciones que publicamos en nuestro sitio web invertimos en promedio dos meses y $400, es un trabajo arduo conseguir y confirmar la información que nos permite revelar lo que algunos poderosos quieren ocultar. </p>

We want to expand our work by increasing the number of investigations we publish per week and developing stories of regional scope, such as the Lava Jato series that involves 12 countries. We invite readers to contribute to the development of our investigations.</p><p>You know as much as we do. We are in one of those critical moments when the most unthinkable things happen every day, and the people involved do everything possible to hide them and continue with their actions with impunity. Al Gore, who knows the subject quite well, said, ""If people are not informed, they cannot hold the government accountable when it is incompetent, corrupt or both.""</p><p><br/>This is where we play our part. Since July 2014, we have conducted over 300 in-depth investigations, from Odebrecht donations to campaigns of both opposition and pro-government politicians in Venezuela and the Panama Papers, to the series on the collapse of the Venezuelan public health system. A few days ago, we won the second place in the Latin American Investigative Journalism Award 2017, awarded by IPYS, for our series ""Military Outsourcing"" about how uniformed people have won contracts and multimillion-dollar imports of the Government.</p><p><br/>We want to expand our work by increasing the number of reports we publish per week and generating a competition among Latin American investigative journalists to develop stories of regional scope such as the series on Lava Jato (the corruption framework between Brazilian companies and corrupt politicians that involves 12 countries, including Venezuela, and at least 6 former presidents).</p><p><br/>Understanding that each story involves at least two months of work, we invite you to finance a day of work, two days, a week, or even a whole story. We see this campaign as an opportunity for thousands of Venezuelans to raise our voice in a critical moment of opacity and impunity and reveal together what powerful unscrupulous people want to hide.</p><h3>
<br/>Fund an Investigation</h3><p>In each investigation we publish on our website, we invest two months and US$ 400 in average.<br/>Obtaining and confirming the information that allows us to reveal what some powerful people want to hide is a hard work. </p><h3>

<li>
<strong>One day of investigation: </strong>Keep abreast of each story by activating your monthly subscription.</li>

Vemos esta campaña como una oportunidad para que miles de venezolanos elevemos nuestra voz, en un momento tan crítico de opacidad e impunidad y revelemos en conjunto lo que poderosos sin escrúpulos quieren ocultar
Financia una investigación
En cada una de las investigaciones que publicamos en nuestro sitio web invertimos en promedio dos meses y $400, es un trabajo arduo conseguir y confirmar la información que nos permite revelar lo que algunos poderosos quieren ocultar. 
Contribuye desde:


Un día de investigación: mantente informado de cada una con la activación de tu suscripción mensual.

Dos semanas de investigación:  activaremos tu suscripción trimestral y enviaremos para tu colección nuestro libro Panama Papers .

Web: Armando.infoFacebook: @armando.investigaInstagram: @armando.infoTwitter: @armandoinfoEnglish VersionWe have published over 300 in-depth investigations, from Odebrecht donations to political campaigns, the Panama Papers, to the series on the collapse of the public health system. We want to expand our work by increasing the number of investigations we publish per week and developing stories of regional scope, such as the Lava Jato series that involves 12 countries. We invite readers to contribute to the development of our investigations.You know as much as we do. We are in one of those critical moments when the most unthinkable things happen every day, and the people involved do everything possible to hide them and continue with their actions with impunity. Al Gore, who knows the subject quite well, said, ""If people are not informed, they cannot hold the government accountable when it is incompetent, corrupt or both.""This is where we play our part. Since July 2014, we have conducted over 300 in-depth investigations, from Odebrecht donations to campaigns of both opposition and pro-government politicians in Venezuela and the Panama Papers, to the series on the collapse of the Venezuelan public health system. A few days ago, we won the second place in the Latin American Investigative Journalism Award 2017, awarded by IPYS, for our series ""Military Outsourcing"" about how uniformed people have won contracts and multimillion-dollar imports of the Government.We want to expand our work by increasing the number of reports we publish per week and generating a competition among Latin American investigative journalists to develop stories of regional scope such as the series on Lava Jato (the corruption framework between Brazilian companies and corrupt politicians that involves 12 countries, including Venezuela, and at least 6 former presidents).Understanding that each story involves at least two months of work, we invite you to finance a day of work, two days, a week, or even a whole story. We see this campaign as an opportunity for thousands of Venezuelans to raise our voice in a critical moment of opacity and impunity and reveal together what powerful unscrupulous people want to hide.
Fund an InvestigationIn each investigation we publish on our website, we invest two months and US$ 400 in average.Obtaining and confirming the information that allows us to reveal what some powerful people want to hide is a hard work. 
Contribute with:

One day of investigation: Keep abreast of each story by activating your monthly subscription.

Two weeks of investigation: Have your quarterly subscription activated and receive our Panama Papers book for your collection.

The Born Frees are setting their words down on paper. They’re finding their voices.  And together, we’re telling their stories.

The Backstory: “Voices of the Girls”
In 2010, I left behind a career working in communications for DC nonprofits to go to South Africa as a Fulbright Scholar. I had just completed an MFA in nonfiction writing, and I was ready to write my first book. As I was trying to find my voice as a writer, I wanted to help others do the same. So I spent a year leading a creative writing club for teen-aged girls in Gugulethu, a township ten miles outside Cape Town. They named the group Amazw’Entombi -- “Voices of the Girls,” in Xhosa.
THE BORN FREES: Writing with the Girls of Gugulethu will be a narrative nonfiction account of several members of the club. My book is the first that tells the stories of this generation of black South African girls “born free” and coming of age after the end of apartheid, and the first that incorporates the words of girls themselves, their poetry and prose. 
Along with racial liberation, they inherited a country plagued by poverty. They’ve lost mothers and fathers, to AIDS and violence. In a place where the rape of women--and even little girls--is widespread, some have lost things they struggle to name. And still, they act like girls. They’re fun and funny, resilient and smart as a whip. They come together around the power of their own words. Their spirits, their writing, and the power of their insight--about themselves and about their beloved country--continue to astonish me.
  
Where the Book Stands Now -- And What It Still Needs
I’m beyond thrilled that my book is under contract with W.W. Norton, one of the best publishers in the world. THE BORN FREES will be published in 2014, which coincides with the 20th anniversary of South Africa’s first democratic elections. I’ve previously written about South Africa for The Atlantic and Sojourners, and as a fellow through the International Reporting Project. 
As wonderful a publisher as Norton is, a book about girls in South Africa in 2013 earns only a modest book deal. So I’m funding the research and writing of this book myself. I don’t have any organizational or academic backing. As a freelance writer, I also don’t have a steady salary.

This book truly is a labor of love. I love South Africa, I love these girls, and I know you'll love them, too.

When the book’s in bookstores and available online next year, you’ll know you played an important role in bringing it out and making it as compelling as possible.

<strong>What’s Real Advice For The Unemployed?</strong> </h3>
<p>To much of the planet, the unemployed are just numbers on a page. We’re part of the 7.8%, or 7.9%, or whatever number that’s being used at the end of each month to explain the unemployment percentages. We’re one of the 13,000,000... no, wait, you have to add in the underemployed, so now we’re part of the 17,000,000... no, wait, you have to add in the numbers that have completely stopped looking for work altogether, so now we’re part of the 20,000,000 unemployed. And on and on and on.</p>

<h3><strong>Two Very Important Things You Need To Know:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Your investment ACTUALLY matters.</strong></p>
<p>You do not need to be unemployed to invest in this book.This book has the potential of reaching thousands of people who are desperate for any help they can get to face the enormous problems and pressures brought on by unemployment. They are urgently looking for solutions they cannot find themselves. This book acts as that advocate for them, and lets them know there is help and there <strong>are</strong> solutions.</p>
<p><strong>You do not need to be unemployed to find this book useful:</strong></p>
<p>This book has been designed to speak to those who are always on the financial edge. It teaches you how to navigate the rough waters of home finance, relationships with your wife/husband/children, and how to deal with those who could, with one stroke of the pen, take it all away from you.</p>
<h3><strong>What Does ""Real Advice"" Actually Mean?</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>Real Advice For The Unemployed</em></strong> is a new book that offers you <strong>lots</strong> of helpful coping skills, relevant stories, and solid advice on getting yourself whole again - emotionally, as well as financially. Use it as your guide, your road map, to find your way back to prosperity. </p>
<p>In this essential reader, we cover a whole host of tips on<strong> lowering your mortgage and car payments</strong>, how to handle <strong>Gary</strong>, the guy on the other end of the phone who wants to get paid, <strong>job hunting advice,</strong> dealing with the <strong>government</strong>, handling <strong>your spouse and family</strong>, and a whole bunch of survival skills that help you confront the day-to-day mountain of problems unemployment brings. There's also a lot of amusing anecdotal and poignant stories that discuss the absurdities of the unemployed life, and remind you that you are not going crazy, and you <strong>don’t</strong> have to go through this alone.</p>

<h3><strong>Is There More? Of Course.</strong></h3>
<p>You not only get to <strong>read</strong> this informative and helpful book for some great guidance and encouragement, but <strong>participate</strong> in it as well. We want you to submit <strong>your own personal</strong> story of frustration and madness of what unemployment <strong>has meant</strong> to you and your family. It can consist of a sentence or two, or even a whole page. The stories that you send to us will be included throughout the pages of the book.</p>
<p>We will give you a <strong>real platform</strong> to tell the world, in your own words, the upheaval your unemployment has caused. If you would like, we will even <strong>include a photograph of you and your family</strong> so that everyone who reads the book will have a better sense of who you are.</p>
<p>That you are much more than just a number on a page.</p>
<p>We’re talking about the incredible, insane choices you now have to make almost every day.</p>
<p>Just as one easy example: You’re at the grocery store in the condiments aisle. As you survey the products, you already know that Grey Poupon is out of the question. So you look at the French's Mustard. That’s when you remember that you have no bread at home and not enough money to buy both the mustard <strong>and</strong> the bread. So you stand there trying to look, well, normal, as your brain attempts to sort this mess out. “I can get bread, but I’ll have no mustard to put on it. Or, I can get mustard, but I’ll have no bread to put it on.” Goddamnsonofabitch. </p>

<p>We have big plans for this book. Depending on how many responses we get, formatting this book could be quite a challenge. It’s a complex job, but an important one. And it should be.</p>
<p>We wrote this book not only because it’s relevant, but because we have something to offer people who, right now, are faced with complex decisions that directly affect their lives. Decisions that just a short time ago, they never thought they would have to make.</p>
<p>And like everything else, getting this book out costs money. Getting it out correctly and professionally costs even more. Your investment will be used for EDITING, COLLATING, FORMATTING, TYPESETTING, PUBLISHING, DISTRIBUTION, MARKETING, COVER ART, TAXES, and all the other expected and unexpected costs we have to face.</p>
<p>If we can get to our stretch goals, we will be able to produce a limited number of hard bound copies, get that ISBN number, and create more copies for distribution. This campaign, if successful, will help us connect with an extensive audience. <strong>There's real value in that.</strong></p>
<p>Also, if we are able to surpass our goals we will even distribute free of charge, any remaining copies to those who are unemployed and can’t afford to purchase one. They can pay us back by finding employment. And, it’s just good Karma.</p>

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p><strong>Hortensias deshojadas</strong> nos muestra la realidad que supuso para muchos jóvenes, con la llegada de la Guerra Civil Española, el conocer lo que era un verdadero odio y lo que era una verdadera amistad.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Ya en la posguerra, Nieves, Mario y Roberto sufrieron en su corazón cada uno de ellos la desfloración, el atropello y un desgarrador desenlace, mientras los vencedores, con el premio a su victoria en su bolsillo y creyéndose que todo sería un alfombrado camino de vino y rosas, acabaron convirtiéndolo por su engreimiento en oscuros y espinosos vericuetos. Para los perdedores supondría el tener que soportar ya no la pesada carga de los vencedores que no les dejaron vivir sino también la de tener que soportar la brutalidad y la de tener que jugar al olvido.</p>

</div></div>","¿Qué?
Hortensias deshojadas nos muestra la realidad que supuso para muchos jóvenes, con la llegada de la Guerra Civil Española, el conocer lo que era un verdadero odio y lo que era una verdadera amistad.
Ya en la posguerra, Nieves, Mario y Roberto sufrieron en su corazón cada uno de ellos la desfloración, el atropello y un desgarrador desenlace, mientras los vencedores, con el premio a su victoria en su bolsillo y creyéndose que todo sería un alfombrado camino de vino y rosas, acabaron convirtiéndolo por su engreimiento en oscuros y espinosos vericuetos. Para los perdedores supondría el tener que soportar ya no la pesada carga de los vencedores que no les dejaron vivir sino también la de tener que soportar la brutalidad y la de tener que jugar al olvido.

<h3>Who is Eden Evans?</h3>
<p>Eden Evans grew up with her mother and grandmother in Bayside, Queens, where she attended a private high school, graduating at age 15.  By 17, she was backstage at Madison Square Garden three nights a week and traveling up and down the eastern corridor with bands from Rainbow and Deep Purple to Iron Maiden, Dio, Eric Clapton and Kiss. She enjoyed a wild ride and became known as “The Whip Lady” and the “Queen of the New York Rock Scene.” </p>
<p>At age 23, life handed her a challenge when she was diagnosed with a brain tumor, having surgery  two years later. But that did not stop her and she landed a job as an IT expert. Years later, Eden had another battle to face. After overcoming cancer multiple times, she was left with Delayed Radiation Syndrome and Panhypopituitarism. Yet, being the type of person who never gives up, she still slept with famous musicians, until she was in her 40's. She is now in the process of writing her memoir, “Good Times, Bad Times...” and is looking for: </p>

We are a non-profit, Christ-oriented, licensed organization that helps physically, mentally and emotionally challenged children and adults through horseback riding and one-on-one interaction.</p>
<p>We are curently in need of a place to begin our center. We have the property located but need donations to put a down payment on it. 100% of all donations go toward the purchase of the property and riding equipment. After meeting this goal we plan to expand the center to include: a day camp for terminally ill children, the rescue of abused and negleted animals, as well as the Horses for Heros program which provides Equine Assisted Healthcare to our wounded U.S. Military Veterans.</p>
<p>SpiritHorse is a 72 step method of therapeutic riding, also know as Equine <br/>Assisted Healthcare. It is gaining acceptence in the medical field as a legitimate and successful tool for the developement of special needs individuals. Not only do the individuals get to interact with the horses, they get instruction from a SpiritHorse certified instructor who has had specialized training for this program which has been developed with the help of many experts in the medical field.</p>
<p>Most therapeutic riding is done in a group setting, but our SpiritHorse riding is done on a one-on-one basis that involves the parents' participation so as to design a program that best fits that individual's needs and progress. Although we do charge for these sessions, NO child is turned away due to their inability to pay. We only ask them to give what they can, and rely on donations to cover the rest of the cost. We are here for the children, every decision is made for the child, not the Center.</p>
<p>Your donation will help children grow both physically and mentally to their full potential. We don't offer ""perks or gifts"" for your donation, as we want all donations to go directly to the organization so we can get started as soon as possible. If, by chance, our goal is not met, rest assured all donations go into a special account until we can meet these goals.</p>

<p>Distress, anxiety, and fear are all too common in the world today, creating a downward spiral that threatens to pull us all into negativity. <br/></p>

If the person who sells you coffee in the morning is chipper and bright, your day  takes on a completely different tone than if that same person is grumpy and out of sorts. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Add to that, the fact that happiness, and the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">habits</span> of happiness counteract the effects of stress hormones that flood our bodies all day long just from normal daily life.</p>

Is happiness only for a few lucky people?
Could happiness (or unhappiness) affect my health? My income? My relationships? (Hint: Yes!)

Is happiness compatible with 21st century life?
Is happiness dependent on one's circumstances in life?
The good news is that there is enough happiness to go around.

The book experience continues online in a special web environment filled with additional thoughts, activities and inspirations. Listen to guided visualizations related to happiness. Ponder additional journal questions. View inspiring video. See where copies of the book have traveled. Grow your happiness habits.


The Impact
Distress, anxiety, and fear are all too common in the world today, creating a downward spiral that threatens to pull us all into negativity. 

Happiness creates an upward spiral. Every person who learns how to keep themselves happy helps us all do the same. You know this is true! If the person who sells you coffee in the morning is chipper and bright, your day  takes on a completely different tone than if that same person is grumpy and out of sorts. 

Add to that, the fact that happiness, and the habits of happiness counteract the effects of stress hormones that flood our bodies all day long just from normal daily life.

Happiness and the habits of happiness can be life saving.
Help me spread the power of happiness by distributing 1000 free copies of my little book, Being Truly Happy which tells the seven secrets of Truly Happy People and puts true happiness into anyone's reach. 

What We Need & What You Get
I need $1500.00 (USD) to cover the printing and delivery costs for the first 1000 copies of Being Truly Happy.

Any amount that I raise in this campaign will go towards these costs. If I meet my goal - great! If I don't, your money won't be wasted. I will still print and give away 1000 copies of my book - it'll just take me a little longer to save up and get it done. EVERY CONTRIBUTION HELPS!

Any amount raised over the goal will go towards printing more copies of the book that will also be distributed for free. 

WHAT YOU GET:
For contributions of $10 - an autographed copy of Being Truly Happy
For contributions of $25.00 - the above + four additional signed copies for you to give as gifts (makes a great stocking stuffer)
For contributions o $100.00 - your five signed copies of Being Truly Happy + an audio download of Prosperity Meditations by author Sue Bryan
For contributions of $175.00 - your five signed copies of Being Truly Happy, your audio download of Prosperity Meditations + a free Happiness Coaching Session by phone with author, Sue Bryan.
For contributions of $250.00 - your five signed copies of Being Truly Happy, your audio downloads + Author, Sue Bryan will take you out to lunch. If you are not in the Los Angeles area, we will have a picnic together via online conference call. 

Other Ways You Can Help
SPREAD HAPPINESS! I fully realize that not everyone has money laying around to donate to someone else's cause. I appreciate you even reading this far! 

Whether you contribute to this project or not, you can help spread happiness and help build that upward spiral of well being by endorsing this project and sending it out to your friends, family or network. You can also request additional copies of Being Truly Happy and for the cost of shipping to your location, you can have copies of the book to give out in your community.

<p><strong>Story of My Book + IMEA: Making Pivotal Moments</strong><br/><br/>My name is Mia Lee and I am the author of IMEA: Making Pivotal Moments.

Throughout the story, she evolves from someone who is seen as a chess piece to be moved, to someone who kicks butt and takes names. Her character is all about redefining what people think the role of a princess should be.<br/><br/>My name is Khadijah L. Wynter and I am the author of <i>The Mafia Princess. </i>I wrote this book to showcase a strong female protagonist that doesn’t need anyone to save her and actively goes against the traditional “princess” role. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a strong, relatable character. You will see that not all princesses follow the typical “Disney-style” mold that says they need someone — usually a man — to save them. A real princess takes control of her own story.<br/><br/>Take a glimpse into Angelia Ferrari’s world as she tells you exactly how it is:<br/><br/>“In the Mafia lifestyle, you never know when your last day alive will be. Walking down the street with your guard down can lead to you on the side of the road choking on your own blood. Usually over something your employer did, and your murderer will kill you just to send them a message. Betraying the wrong family can lead to one bullet to the head and two to the chest if you are lucky. If you’re not lucky, well, you could spend the last few days of your life stuck in a basement being tortured just for your limbs to be sent to your family piece by piece, with your family hoping they have all the pieces of your body before the day of your funeral. Such are the risks you take in our business. While the men are praised for their heroics, the women are forced to shut up, look pretty, and shop like the airheads their husbands want them to be. Being trained to pull the trigger as a woman is relatively unheard of. This leads to Mafia wives and daughters — ‘princesses’ — being utterly defenseless. That’s not the life I wanted to live, my destiny is bigger than this.<br/><br/>“I, Angelica Ferrari, was destined to be more. I won’t let the barriers my father think I should abide by keep me down. I don’t abide by the rules these old-timers set for me. Nor should I take the abuse my father is determined to dish out to have me stay compliant to him. I clutch my gun and sheath my blades every morning before leaving my loft. I may be a princess, but I’m not a Disney princess. As far as I’m concerned, a real princess gets off her ass and gets shit done. I’ve done tons of jobs with the benefit of my family in mind. I’ve never needed some man to swoop in and save me like a damsel in distress and I find no need to have one now. <br/><br/>“But when my father’s loyalty and intentions comes into question, and my brother Leonardo turns up missing, the only person I can possibly turn to is a guy from another Mafia family: Cristian Salvatore, the heir to the Salvatore throne. But when Cristian finds himself in a sticky situation, it looks like the only person to rescue the men that I need the most is me. You know what they say, real women kick ass.”<br/><br/>You will love this book if you enjoy modern stories about the mafia, strong female protagonists, and narratives that reject traditional stereotypes. <i>The Mafia Princess </i>speaks to women and a young adult audience who value a strong female protagonist with agency, and want to see more stories that challenge the “damsel in distress” narrative you typically see in princess stories — they want to see a princess who rescues herself!<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>The Mafia Princess </i>inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions and statements like:</p><p>Why do traditional princess narratives position the princess waiting to be saved, as if she doesn’t have agency otherwise?</p><p>Can the definition of a “princess” be flexible and go against tradition? </p><p>How do you become your own hero and not rely on someone else?</p><p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing the dynamics of the princess narrative and becoming your own hero will change us all for the better. </p><h3><u><strong>The Book - The Mafia Princess</strong></u></h3><p>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction + chapters 1-3. Readers are introduced to the main character, Angelica Ferrari, and are shown a glimpse of the current situation she finds herself in. It also introduces the secondary character, Cristian Salvatore, and his notorious family as well. <br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 3-10. Here the reader is given a taste of Angelica’s determination to write her own story and be her own hero. Of course, nothing comes easy, so we watch the internal and external battle that Angelica has to go through to be who she is determined to be. Also, how Angelica reacts when on the verge of losing everything and everyone she loves.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3 </strong>contains chapters 11-Epilogue. These chapters brings Angelica’s story to a close and show us the decision she makes after all that’s happened. Will she choose the family she was born into, or the new found family she has found along the way?<br/> </p><h3><u><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></u></h3><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

Khadijah’s niece asked her one day, “Why does the princess always have to be rescued?” With that in mind, Khadijah wanted to create a story where the female lead does not need to be rescued by a male secondary character.

Instead, she ends up being the one to do the rescuing herself. When Khadijah isn’t writing, she loves reading, archery, baking, and spending time with her family and friends. For more information, you can connect with Khadijah L. Wynter at Khadijahwynterwriting@yahoo.com and on Instagram @_khadijahwynerauthor. Risks & ChallengesThe biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier. The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship. Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>Giresun Island</i> is a Science Fiction novel about a young soldier whose family is killed in the eternal conflict between Kurds and their neighbors. After the decimation of her village, the woman drifts into the desert, to emerge years later stripped to the core of herself. She ends up starting a new life in a burgeoning island nation, only to have it threatened by the same greed and violence all over again.<br/><br/>My name is John McKeel, and I am the author of <i>Giresun Island</i>. I wrote this book because of my admiration for the power and strength of women, the experience of war, homecoming, and second chances. <br/><br/>I hope that, in reading this book, you will discover that the differences between people—men, women, one nationality or another—are less significant than advertised. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to escape into a world a little further along than ours and engage in how we interact with our own.</p>
<p>Giresun Island lies a few hundred miles off the Pacific coast of South America. It mysteriously appeared 150 years ago, to be colonized by women and outcasts the world over. They turned a barren island into a tropical paradise, teeming with technological resources where one can become anything they choose. On the mainland, another attempt at the unification of South American countries is led by the son of a deposed drug cartel czar. The best intentions lead the young prince down the road of power, into a confrontation with the matriarchy of Giresun. Caught in the middle of the conflict,the young Kurdish immigrant is left not knowing who to trust.</p>

<h3>The Skinny</h3>
<ul>
<li>I am Saul Rip Hansen, the author of The Shendoa and Underworld Legacy Series.</li>
<li>
<strong>After four years</strong> of work, I have completed my latest novel.</li>
<li>
<strong>Getting this book to you is what this project is about</strong>. </li>
<li>The last four years I have dedicated every spare moment to better learn the craft of storytelling. This project is important to me because I used this story to implement all the lessons I strove to learn to master this craft. That benefits you as a reader. How you ask? <strong>You get a highly entertaining story that hits all your favorite sweet spots like all good books do.</strong> I have <i>slaved</i> away on this one to get it just right. There are some magical spots in this one that surprised me, and if it can do that for the guy who wrote it, then I know it will for you as the reader.  </li>

<h2>What's the Book About?</h2>
<p><strong>Where Has All The Magic Gone?</strong></p>
<p>Imagine <strong>The Knights of The Round Table</strong> never completely disbanded. What if they created a brotherhood to withstand the test of time, to keep watch for any heirs of King Arthur, and protect them from the last surfacing echoes of evil still seeking to hunt them down? </p>
<p>What if <strong>Merlin</strong> predicted the rise of a particular heir, and with this heir, prepared the way for a re-awakening of all the lost magic in the world?</p>
<p>What if the only way for <strong>Merlin</strong> to do this, was to plan a way to <strong>reincarnate</strong> at the same time as this one particular heir, to again act as a guide and friend to the house of Arthur Pendragon?</p>
<p>With all those parts in play, <strong>what evils have survived</strong> from the time of The Round Table, and <strong>why are they still interested in an Heir</strong>, and besides all that, where has all the magic gone?</p>
<p>Maybe it’s time it all came back.</p>

<h3>Cover Copy</h3>
<p>On the night a cosmic event collides with a thunderstorm in New York City, Zoey and her best friend Emyrus are on their way to a concert when the two girls are caught in the storm and struck by beams of light that burn strange emblems into the ground, initiating a change in both of them. </p>
<p>Zoey and Emyrus begin to elicit abnormal abilities leading them on an adventure indicating they both have ties to King Arthur and the realm of Avalon. As magical influences begin to reach the two girls, ancient rivals begin to cross and double cross each other to get closer to Zoey and Emyrus in hopes of rediscovering the magical sword Excalibur. </p>
<p>Driven by survival, both girls unwittingly tumble into a journey of self-discovery as they track down clues explaining what is happening to them, and the challenges they must face in order to regain control of their lives. </p>
<h3>At Its Heart  </h3>
<p>The core of this story, is following the <strong>emotional development of Zoey</strong> as she deals with making sense of some <strong>undue unfairness</strong> that life has dealt to her, and having <strong>the reader</strong> <strong>witness her reactions</strong> and how she chooses to feel about her past, all wrapped up in an <strong>exponentially accelerating plot </strong>filled with magic and the <strong>highest of stakes</strong>, her own survival. </p>
<p>I hope you join me in experiencing this remarkable story. I am excited to include you on the evolution of this series. Even I don’t know. Let’s see where it goes. </p>
<p>If you feel strongly enough, you have everything here to do something about it. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div><ul>
<li>My goal is to make a <strong>minimum of $3,000</strong>. Where is that going? It is to get books out to you, and any additional money will be spent on marketing to get even more books out to you and people like you. </li>
<li>I am going to write a sequel to this book, and probably at least two. Because I already know that, there are some <strong>perks that are crazy unique</strong>, but also super fun, that I believe you will find interesting, that no other author out there I am aware of is offering. Be sure to check them out. </li>
<li>
<strong>If I don't make my funding goal, I am not going to write the sequel!</strong> Just kidding, that would be ridiculous. Writer's write, painters paint. This is what I do. Even if I don't make my funding goal, I am still going to write the sequel. But what's cool, is that by helping me reach my goal, you will be involved in the evolution of this story until it is fully told, and that I can promise, will be interesting and intriguing to follow. </li>
</ul></div><div>
<h3>The Impact: Why Backing This Project Will Make The World Better</h3>
<ul>
<li>By contributing to this project, you will help spread the good ideas that I have infused into my stories.</li>
<li>Because of an incredible conglomerate of rad people, both of my previous campaigns for the Shendoa and Underworld Legacy Series were fully funded, and over-funded even. My hope is to build on that remarkable community to spread good media and good stories by making them available to more people. The best way to make them available to more people, is to make people aware that the content is even there. That's what the marketing end will do.  </li>
<li>I will always write, and I will do my best to infuse stories with morality and believable depictions of good and bad, light and dark, so that the things that readers get out of them won't just be surface level, they'll read because they know every time they pick up one of my books, they'll find some real depth there. If there's one thing I can promise as an Author, then that's it. My stories will make you feel, make you think, and make you appreciate your own humanity. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are risks and challenges of course, as in any endeavor. (Sigh), but at this point in my life, I just accept with gratitude that things always work out, and I would rather suffer now than later to make it so. </p>
<ul>
<li>During this unprecedented time, taking great care to make sure that rewards sent to backers are as sterilized as possible is our first priority. Doing all we can to make sure the welfare and protection of you and your family members is at the focus of our attention. We will be vigilant in being courteous to you and your health. </li>
<li>Luckily there weren't any outstanding issues with either of the last campaigns, and we expect smooth sailing with this one as well. </li>
<li>Whatever challenges arise, we will handle them one step at a time, and make sure that you are taken care of. We got your back. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I totally get that some people can't contribute, or may not be into this genre of book, but want to help in some way. Here's other ways you can lend a hand to the success of this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please share this project on Facebook, or other social media, and tag someone you know is into this kind of thing. They'll think it's cool, I promise. </li>
<li>Right here on Indiegogo, they have provided ""share"" tools to make posting this to your social media a one-click breeze.  </li>
</ul>
</div><h3>One Last Call To Action</h3><p>Buy this book! Either for yourself or as a gift, someone you personally know will love it. There are a ton of super cool things that went into the making of this book, and by backing this project you will get all the updates that give all those cool insider behind-the-scenes stories that are both fascinating and inspiring. Join this community, you'll love it. </p><h3>In Case You Like Reading...</h3><p><strong>What resonates most is this...</strong></p><p>Years ago, by complete chance, my dad ran into Sean Astin at the Seattle airport, Sean was on his way to visit his mom for her birthday, and my dad said, “I have a son who is writing a book, and it would mean the world to him if you called him.” I was eighteen, and was writing the last scene of my first completed manuscript when he called. This still blows my mind. He gave me his email address, and for the next three months, he personally coached me, teaching me the ins and outs of the writing industry, and how to prepare and package a story for representation. It was incredible, I still can’t believe he did that, and I will always be grateful to him for that. I admired Sean Astin before, but that made me pay more attention to his creative projects, and what he committed himself to. What I noticed, is that he has positioned himself as an advocate for good media. More than anything, I decided I wanted to emulate THAT. </p><p>With this latest story, my hope was to write a hit, but my GOAL was to make good media, because the world needs it. So that is where I started. This was what my internal dialogue sounded like: ""I’m writing a young adult novel, what challenges do young people face? Infusing story with value, how can I help young people win when pitted against those challenges?"" That mindset controlled every word on the page. On the surface it entertains, but between the lines, there is depth, REAL depth, and that’s where the magic is. THAT’S what resonates. It’s providing little light bulb aha moments that ring for a while, and that’s what readers remember most. </p><p>In deciding to write a modern take on the King Arthur legend, the first thing I did was dig up the oldest, most original versions of the story I could find, and used that as the basis for generating ideas, because the original is so rich. What I found in doing that, was that human nature hasn’t changed much in the last 1,500 years. The themes surrounding King Arthur are just as relevant now as ever. </p><p>This story became a study, of the idea of owning your choices--REALLy owning them. In life, you have an endpoint or goal that becomes your expectation, but then circumstances and opportunities emerge which force you to make a choice you didn’t necessarily plan on, but based on the cards in your hand, you made a certain choice, you committed to a certain direction, which at different crossroads take you in a COMPLETELY different direction than where you thought you would be. And because the grass is greener on the other side, the temptation is to look back, and wonder how different things would be had you made a different choice. </p><p>Writing this story, I wanted to end that temptation, that tendency to look back, and for almost the entire story, through several drafts and changes, I wrote that struggle into each of my character’s lives. Once that theme emerged, I connected some dots that hadn’t quite clicked for me, then I went back through the whole book and emphasized it deliberately, which made all the difference, for me personally, and for my characters. When writing a book, there are times that I brush away dust and uncover words that surprise me, and benefit me in my own personal life, and if that happens for me, then I know it will happen for the reader as well, and I get excited about the story. Because it has taken four years to write, this story has a high concentration of those moments. It was fun to write, and it’s fun to read. It’s an absolute blast, that picks up in momentum, and only gets faster and faster, all the way to the end.  </p><p>You want a good story, you want good media, then this one’s for you.</p></div>","The Skinny

One Last Call To ActionBuy this book! Either for yourself or as a gift, someone you personally know will love it. There are a ton of super cool things that went into the making of this book, and by backing this project you will get all the updates that give all those cool insider behind-the-scenes stories that are both fascinating and inspiring. Join this community, you'll love it. In Case You Like Reading...What resonates most is this...Years ago, by complete chance, my dad ran into Sean Astin at the Seattle airport, Sean was on his way to visit his mom for her birthday, and my dad said, “I have a son who is writing a book, and it would mean the world to him if you called him.” I was eighteen, and was writing the last scene of my first completed manuscript when he called. This still blows my mind. He gave me his email address, and for the next three months, he personally coached me, teaching me the ins and outs of the writing industry, and how to prepare and package a story for representation. It was incredible, I still can’t believe he did that, and I will always be grateful to him for that. I admired Sean Astin before, but that made me pay more attention to his creative projects, and what he committed himself to. What I noticed, is that he has positioned himself as an advocate for good media. More than anything, I decided I wanted to emulate THAT. With this latest story, my hope was to write a hit, but my GOAL was to make good media, because the world needs it. So that is where I started. This was what my internal dialogue sounded like: ""I’m writing a young adult novel, what challenges do young people face? Infusing story with value, how can I help young people win when pitted against those challenges?"" That mindset controlled every word on the page. On the surface it entertains, but between the lines, there is depth, REAL depth, and that’s where the magic is. THAT’S what resonates. It’s providing little light bulb aha moments that ring for a while, and that’s what readers remember most. In deciding to write a modern take on the King Arthur legend, the first thing I did was dig up the oldest, most original versions of the story I could find, and used that as the basis for generating ideas, because the original is so rich. What I found in doing that, was that human nature hasn’t changed much in the last 1,500 years. The themes surrounding King Arthur are just as relevant now as ever. This story became a study, of the idea of owning your choices--REALLy owning them. In life, you have an endpoint or goal that becomes your expectation, but then circumstances and opportunities emerge which force you to make a choice you didn’t necessarily plan on, but based on the cards in your hand, you made a certain choice, you committed to a certain direction, which at different crossroads take you in a COMPLETELY different direction than where you thought you would be. And because the grass is greener on the other side, the temptation is to look back, and wonder how different things would be had you made a different choice. Writing this story, I wanted to end that temptation, that tendency to look back, and for almost the entire story, through several drafts and changes, I wrote that struggle into each of my character’s lives. Once that theme emerged, I connected some dots that hadn’t quite clicked for me, then I went back through the whole book and emphasized it deliberately, which made all the difference, for me personally, and for my characters. When writing a book, there are times that I brush away dust and uncover words that surprise me, and benefit me in my own personal life, and if that happens for me, then I know it will happen for the reader as well, and I get excited about the story. Because it has taken four years to write, this story has a high concentration of those moments. It was fun to write, and it’s fun to read. It’s an absolute blast, that picks up in momentum, and only gets faster and faster, all the way to the end.  You want a good story, you want good media, then this one’s for you.",1.0,0,"3 Campaigns

The basic but compelling concept for the book is to pair the 
children's hand-written rules strips with issue related postcards that kids created when urged to express themselves artistically about their parents divorce.




In week six of Children of Divorce & Changing Families' 8-week program, we do an exercise where the kids in our 10-12 year old peer group get the chance to write the Rules of Divorce. Rules they feel, if followed, would make post-divorce life less stressful. 


The rules they write privately are then shared with the class and the kids find relief and strength in the fact that many of their requests are the same.
 
After years of doing this and other exercises and watching the same issues come up time and time again I felt I had the elements to create a different kind of book on divorce. 

A book that empowers children and enlightens parents.

The book is now complete (sample page above) but we still need funds to print 200 copies in time for the Tucson Festival of Books.

<p>My name is Claudette Melanson, and I'm an Indie Author from Kitchener, Ontario. I've published two Young Adult novels, Rising Tide: Dark Innocence and Undertow: Death's Twilight. Both have won awards from Readers' Favorite and Rising Tide is also a Medalist winner in the 2015 New Apple Summer Ebook Awards.</p>
<p>One of my current projects is a children's book I'm working on with my illustrator, Rachel Montreuil, who did the covers for both Rising Tide and Undertow. Rachel is a very talented illustrator who is just beginning to build her career. You will definitely be helping to further her while helping me, and supporting the Arts--one aspect of life which makes it worth living.</p>

<h3>Što je i kako je nastao ''Iran u prezentu''</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Kažu da kad se jedna vrata zatvore da se druga otvore. Čini se da je 2020. godina za mene bila upravo takva jer mi je nenadano oslobodila vrijeme za nešto o čemu sam sanjao od trenutka kad sam se u Iran preselio, a to je da napišem knjigu. Knjiga ''Iran u prezentu'' je nastala kao posljedica želje da široj javnosti naših krajeva (knjiga je na hrvatskom jeziku) približim Iran, njegove ljude, povijesno i kulturološko nasljeđe i da sve to začinim vlastitim razmišljanjima koja sam razvio tijekom trogodišnjeg života u toj zanimljivoj zemlji. </p>
<p>U knjizi pokušavam čitatelju prezentirati Iran sa željom da nauči nešto novo, da se zabavi pa čak i da možda promijeni neka ustaljena mišljenja nastala prilično jednostranom i nažalost vrlo negativnom portretizacijom u medijima. Iran nije crn kao što fotografije na Googleu nameću, on je tirkizan. U njemu žive krasni ljudi koji svoju povijest i nasljeđe nose s posebnim dostojanstvom te se kroz ovu knjigu trudim čitatelju predočiti upravo takav tirkizan Iran. </p>
<p>Što je to tarof, kako izgledaju pustinjski krajolici, zašto je perzijski dizajn tako neodoljivo lijep, zašto smatram da je naša hrana ukusnija, zašto mislim da živim u jednom od najljepših gradova na svijetu i kako objašnjavam neke restrikcije ili kako definiram položaj žena u društvu - sve su to pitanja nekih od tema na koja se u knjizi trudim dati zanimljiv, poučan i koliko toliko nepristran odgovor.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Što želim?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Kako bih sam izdao knjigu potrebna mi je financijska pomoć. Cilj ove kampanje je postavljen na 6,000€ i taj bi mi iznos trebao biti dovoljan za pokrivanje troška kupovine artikala (perks), postotak koji Indiegogo platforma automatizmom uzima te dovoljan za uređivanje, dizajn i tisak knjige. Kako bih potaknuo interes za vašim sudjelovanjem u kampanji odlučio sam ponuditi raznovrsne artikle jer smatram da živim u zemlji prebogatoj jedinstvenom suvenirskom ponudom.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Artikli (perks)</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Jako sam se potrudio izabrati zanimljive i prikladne artikle te za svaki od njih garantiram maksimalnu kvalitetu iza koje stoji i vrlo zanimljiva priča. Dapače, riječ je o nekim od najkvalitetnijih proizvoda na svijetu pa se nemojte čuditi ako u opisima artikala koristim superlativ ''naj'' jer to zaista jest. Evo nešto dodatnih objašnjenja i priča o nekim od artikala koji se nude.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>STOLNJAK </strong></p>
<p>Jedan od najvidljivijih suvenira na iranskim bazarima su stolnjaci rađeni galamkari tehnikom. Na pamučne tkanine se milimetarski precizno utiskuju motivi velikim drvenim ''štambiljom'' koji je povezan oko ruke galam majstora. U različitim bojama i raznolikim motivima na galamkari stolnjacima se uglavnom pronalaze tipični motivi ispirirani detaljima iz perzijskih vrtova, a to su cvijeće, slavuji, ribe, voda, čempresi i lopoči. Središte galamkari tradicije je grad Esfahan pa ne čudi da u ovoj kampanji ponuđeni stolnjaci dolaze upravo s esfahanskog bazara.</p>

<p><b>ŠAFRAN</b></p>
<p>Šafran je najskuplji začin na svijetu, a njegove najkvalitetnije niti dolaze iz iranskog Horasana. U Faribinom i mojem domu 3,5 grama šafrana traje otprilike dva mjeseca, a to znači da bi lako u nekom europskom domu mogao trajati dvoznamenkasti broj mjeseci. Kako bi ga koristili, a ne zaboravili u nekom nekorištenom kutku kuhinje oni koji kupe ovaj artikl pronaći će upute kako najbolje koristiti ovo crveno zlato. Šafran se koristi prvenstveno kako bi hrani i slasticama dao prekrasan miris i intenzivnu žutu boju, a kažu da ima i izražena antidepresivna svojstva. Vrijedna osmerokutna kutijica u kojoj se nalazi izrađena je hatam tehnikom koju detaljnije objašnjavam nešto niže u tekstu u dijelu koji predstavlja šahovsku i tavla ploču.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605818939/qpbz1ezy4gp3m6tvjif7.jpg"" src=""""/> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>TIRKIZ</b></p>
<p>Sjećam se u djetinjstvu kako mi je najdraža boja bila žuta, no danas mi je to svakako tirkizna. Boja je to iranskih minareta, džamijskih kupola, pločica kraljevskih palača i pozadina uličnih natpisa. A boja je to i naslovnice ove knjige! Nejšaburski tirkiz poznat je diljem svijeta, a u ovom artiklu nudim srebrne narukvice i naušnice s kamenom iz nejšaburskog rudnika. Umirujuća boja ovog dragog kamena donosi sreću, mir i blagostanje, a uz njega se veže interesantna činjenica da se može i pokvariti, a tad se kaže da je tirkiz umro. A kad to tirkiz umire? Kad dođe u dodir s uljem ili mašću. Znači, ne dirati tirkiz neposredno nakon nanošenja kreme na ruke! Vrijedna kutijica za nakit u kojoj se nalaze narukvica i naušnice izrađena je hatam tehnikom koju detaljnije objašnjavam u sljedećem artiklu.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>ŠAHOVSKA I TAVLA PLOČA</strong></p>
<p>Šah je indijska igra koju su usavršili Perzijanci, a najstarija ploča za tavlu pronađena je upravo u Iranu te datira 5,000 godina unazad. Kad se spoji tradicija igranja šaha i tavle s vještim rukama majstora minijature i hatam tehnike dobije se nešto što svojom ljepotom čovjeka ne ostavlja ravnodušnim. Mjeseci detaljnog crtanja minijatura i ubacivanja hatam cvjetova u drvenu ploču čine ovu ploču pravim malim umjetničkim djelom na kojem se posebno cijeni svaki pali pijun ili matirani kralj. Minijature prikazuju perzijsku konjičku igru polo domaćeg naziva čogan, igru koju su perzijski kraljevi s terase svoje palače promatrali na velebnom esfahanskom trgu Nakš-e Džahanu. Potpis majstora minijature nalazi se sitno upisan u jednom od kutova ploče. Iako se na esfahanskom bazaru mogu pronaći šahovske figurice Osmanlija, križara i Kineza, ja sam odlučio iskoristiti povijesnu istinu te na suprotstavljene strane postaviti Perzijance i Grke pa netko može biti Kserks, a netko Leonida ili Temistoklo. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605816332/iqtxhfe09jbhpvrwatjp.jpg"" src=""""/>Tehnika hatam označava slijepljene prutiće drva, mjedi i devine i kravlje kosti koji se vodoravno izrezuju u tanke listiće (cvjetove) te zatim mozaično ubacuju u željenu drvenu površinu. Hatam cvjetovi osnovica su ove šahovske ploče, ali i kutijica u kojima dolaze artikli šafrana i nakita tirkiza. Ploču dostavljam osobno u krugu od 100 km od Zagreba - vi skuhate kavu, a ja vas učim pravilima tavle te pričam priče o bogatom esfahanskom obrtništvu. Ako se adresa nalazi na više od 100 km od Zagreba sve ćemo to nakon poštanske dostave obaviti videopozivom preko Skypa ili WhatsAppa. </p>

<p><b>HORASANSKI TEPIH</b></p>
<p>Kraljica svih iranskih suvenira, podloga svakog iranskog doma, san mnogih u inozemstvu i umjetnost koja traje već tisućama godina. Perzijski tepisi su s pravom najslavniji tepisi na svijetu i zasigurno bi u zapadnom svijetu bili puno prisutniji da kojim slučajem Iran nije pod ekonomskim sankcijama. Svaka provincija ima svoj tipičan dizajn, a s obzirom da mi je supruga Horasanka i da sam knjigu započeo pisati u malom horasanskom selu tijekom korona karantene, imao sam mogućnost detaljno proučiti lokalne tepihe te odabrati jedan od najboljih koji se nudi. Dimenzije su 1,5x2 metra te sadrži 30% svjetlucajuće svile u žutim, bijelim i tirkiznim nijansama što onda tepih čini drugačijim ovisno pod kojim se kutem gleda. Što je to šišanje tepiha? Naime, oko pamučne osnovice pletu se vuneni i svileni čvorići (ovaj ih tepih ima 90/cm2) koji s gornje strane ostavljaju nekoliko centimetara dugačke čuperke. Potvrda da je tepih nov i nekorišten je upravo činjenica da je imao čuperke i da je morao ići na ''šišanje'', a šišao ga je u Esfahanu osobno predsjednik udruge iranskih restauratora tepiha koji mi je potvrdio da se radi o prelijepom i vrhunskom primjerku. Dizajn ovog horasanskog tepiha se naziva <i>rizmahi</i>, sitna riba jer najčešći detalji su mu ribice koje kruže oko lopoča. Dakako, riječ je o motivu iz perzijskih vrtova u čijoj je sredini nerijetko bio bazen u kojem su plivale ribice. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605817441/zj9pjdglze1rrraerswr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>Horasanski tepih dostavljam osobno u krugu od 100 km od Zagreba - vi skuhate kavu, a ja vam pričam o detaljima tepiha dok se divimo mijenjajućim bojama njegove svile. Ako se adresa nalazi na više od 100 km od Zagreba sve ćemo to nakon poštanske dostave obaviti video pozivom preko Skypa ili WhatsAppa.</p>

A boja je to i naslovnice ove knjige! Nejšaburski tirkiz poznat je diljem svijeta, a u ovom artiklu nudim srebrne narukvice i naušnice s kamenom iz nejšaburskog rudnika. Umirujuća boja ovog dragog kamena donosi sreću, mir i blagostanje, a uz njega se veže interesantna činjenica da se može i pokvariti, a tad se kaže da je tirkiz umro. A kad to tirkiz umire? Kad dođe u dodir s uljem ili mašću. Znači, ne dirati tirkiz neposredno nakon nanošenja kreme na ruke! Vrijedna kutijica za nakit u kojoj se nalaze narukvica i naušnice izrađena je hatam tehnikom koju detaljnije objašnjavam u sljedećem artiklu.

 
ŠAHOVSKA I TAVLA PLOČA
Šah je indijska igra koju su usavršili Perzijanci, a najstarija ploča za tavlu pronađena je upravo u Iranu te datira 5,000 godina unazad. Kad se spoji tradicija igranja šaha i tavle s vještim rukama majstora minijature i hatam tehnike dobije se nešto što svojom ljepotom čovjeka ne ostavlja ravnodušnim. Mjeseci detaljnog crtanja minijatura i ubacivanja hatam cvjetova u drvenu ploču čine ovu ploču pravim malim umjetničkim djelom na kojem se posebno cijeni svaki pali pijun ili matirani kralj. Minijature prikazuju perzijsku konjičku igru polo domaćeg naziva čogan, igru koju su perzijski kraljevi s terase svoje palače promatrali na velebnom esfahanskom trgu Nakš-e Džahanu. Potpis majstora minijature nalazi se sitno upisan u jednom od kutova ploče. Iako se na esfahanskom bazaru mogu pronaći šahovske figurice Osmanlija, križara i Kineza, ja sam odlučio iskoristiti povijesnu istinu te na suprotstavljene strane postaviti Perzijance i Grke pa netko može biti Kserks, a netko Leonida ili Temistoklo. Tehnika hatam označava slijepljene prutiće drva, mjedi i devine i kravlje kosti koji se vodoravno izrezuju u tanke listiće (cvjetove) te zatim mozaično ubacuju u željenu drvenu površinu. Hatam cvjetovi osnovica su ove šahovske ploče, ali i kutijica u kojima dolaze artikli šafrana i nakita tirkiza. Ploču dostavljam osobno u krugu od 100 km od Zagreba - vi skuhate kavu, a ja vas učim pravilima tavle te pričam priče o bogatom esfahanskom obrtništvu. Ako se adresa nalazi na više od 100 km od Zagreba sve ćemo to nakon poštanske dostave obaviti videopozivom preko Skypa ili WhatsAppa. 

 
HORASANSKI TEPIH
Kraljica svih iranskih suvenira, podloga svakog iranskog doma, san mnogih u inozemstvu i umjetnost koja traje već tisućama godina. Perzijski tepisi su s pravom najslavniji tepisi na svijetu i zasigurno bi u zapadnom svijetu bili puno prisutniji da kojim slučajem Iran nije pod ekonomskim sankcijama. Svaka provincija ima svoj tipičan dizajn, a s obzirom da mi je supruga Horasanka i da sam knjigu započeo pisati u malom horasanskom selu tijekom korona karantene, imao sam mogućnost detaljno proučiti lokalne tepihe te odabrati jedan od najboljih koji se nudi. Dimenzije su 1,5x2 metra te sadrži 30% svjetlucajuće svile u žutim, bijelim i tirkiznim nijansama što onda tepih čini drugačijim ovisno pod kojim se kutem gleda. Što je to šišanje tepiha? Naime, oko pamučne osnovice pletu se vuneni i svileni čvorići (ovaj ih tepih ima 90/cm2) koji s gornje strane ostavljaju nekoliko centimetara dugačke čuperke. Potvrda da je tepih nov i nekorišten je upravo činjenica da je imao čuperke i da je morao ići na ''šišanje'', a šišao ga je u Esfahanu osobno predsjednik udruge iranskih restauratora tepiha koji mi je potvrdio da se radi o prelijepom i vrhunskom primjerku. Dizajn ovog horasanskog tepiha se naziva rizmahi, sitna riba jer najčešći detalji su mu ribice koje kruže oko lopoča. Dakako, riječ je o motivu iz perzijskih vrtova u čijoj je sredini nerijetko bio bazen u kojem su plivale ribice. 


Horasanski tepih dostavljam osobno u krugu od 100 km od Zagreba - vi skuhate kavu, a ja vam pričam o detaljima tepiha dok se divimo mijenjajućim bojama njegove svile. Ako se adresa nalazi na više od 100 km od Zagreba sve ćemo to nakon poštanske dostave obaviti video pozivom preko Skypa ili WhatsAppa.

This book is one part of her larger goal to support the development of an equitable society. She is infinitely curious and always falling into online deep dives. Lauryn is obsessed with film essays on YouTube, skincare, and spending more time watching Tik Toks than she should. Ask her for a book recommendation! She loves reading. Her goal for her twenties is to travel to forty countries, which she hopes to do when the COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted.For more information, or if you just want to have a chat ;), you can connect with Lauryn at lauryn.mwale3@gmail.com.

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier. The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship. 
Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:
Please share my pre-sale campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network. Please use #The ShuriEffect and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press, so that we can help amplify your efforts.
You can easily share my pre-sale campaign via Indiegogo at the top of the page.
Please share my book with 5 friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it via text or direct message on social media.

<p>Hi Everyone!  My name is Sue.  I have been given the wonderful opportunity to have a new Service Dog Partner!  His name is ""Elliot"" and he is from the American Service Dog Association.  His trainer and owner is Susanne Schenberg.  Elliot is also a Yellow Lab.  I'm a great fan of Labradors!  They are wonderful dogs.   Elliot will allow me to continue to live my life independently.  I would hate to have to miss out on this wonderful dog and opportunity by not having the funds for him!  <br/></p>
<p>The cost of my new Partner is $6,000.00 and we started with a $1,000.00 donation from a very generous supporter!  We currently have $2931.00 on Indiegogo and a little more than a month to go.  I am so grateful to you all for your generous donations!<br/></p>
<p>For the past 11 years I have been blessed to have another American Service <br/>Dog Association Service Dog.  He is an amazing Yellow Lab named ""Droopy"".  Today - October 6th, is Droopy's 12th Birthday and though it saddens my heart, he has more than earned his retirement.  Droopy has been with me, in recovery rooms, hospital rooms, PT rooms and every single step I have taken in my life for 11 years!  He has truly been my guardian angel.  His retirement years will be spent with me in my home.  He recently told me that his retirement plans are to monitor his Facebook page, to watch Ellen DeGeneres dance every day, and to watch all of his favorite TV shows!  So I'm including two photos of him training for retirement.  I hope you enjoy them.<br/></p>
<p>I have spine and right leg damage from an accident, I am a Bi-lateral <br/>Mastectomy Survivor.  Several years ago we found that I have a disease called <br/>MCTD (Mixed Connective Tissue Disease) and then I developed several other <br/>auto-immune diseases.  I have a total of 8 diagnosis'.  There are times when I <br/>have to use a manual wheelchair and a walker.  When I first met Droopy I spent <br/>95% of my time in my wheelchair.  After several surgeries, and with many hours, <br/>years really, of physical and lymphedema therapy - I am able to spend 95% of my <br/>time <strong>walking</strong> with my Service Dog Partner!  I want you to know that without the amazing training of my Service Dog I would not be living as successfully as I do. I am forever grateful to Rob and Susanne Schenberg from the American Service Dog Association.  <br/></p>
<p>I have gone back to college, been an Interpreter For The Deaf - not realizing that I would be losing some of my hearing, and now I use an Interpreter for occasions like funerals, meetings, courtrooms, etc.  I read captioning for movies and TV.  <br/>Droopy has learned to alert me to thunder storm sirens, fire alarms, people calling me from somewhere else in the home and the doorbell.  He has saved my life more times than I can count!  <br/></p>
<p>Thirty years ago I was a Veterinary Tech and that training has helped me to be a good Partner to my Service Dog.  I've been a waitress, a cook and dishwasher at a grill, a Church janitor and I worked on a street department. After my injury, I was a teacher assistant with plans to get my teaching degree.  Unfortunately that dream was not realized, and then my health got worse.  Now, when my health allows it, I volunteer in a local Kindergarten Class.   <br/></p>
<p>Droopy and I have volunteered for 11 years on ""Disability Day"" in several <br/>school districts where I speak to the students about being a Service Dog <br/>Partner.  Droopy and I are now in our 4th year of volunteering in the same local Kindergarten classroom!  The children learn that even though I have many disAbilities that I can still read and write and be a useful member of our society.  They learn that Service Dogs are working dogs and that they too are productive members of society!  I am so grateful to the Principal and the Teachers for giving us this amazing opportunity.  There are many weeks when I can't show up because of my own health issues, or the flu may be going around the school and because of my immune system I cannot volunteer, but we do our best to show up every time we can.  We also go to Boy and Girl Scout Meetings, Churches, Synagogues, Men and Women's Groups to speak about Service Dogs and The Rights of DisAbled Americans.  Invite us and we will gladly come to educate and meet your group!  Volunteering feeds your soul and I recommend that everyone do it!  <br/></p>
<p>I have incredible friends and supporters because Droopy has brought so many people into my life.  I hope that you will be willing to help me achieve my goal of my <br/>next Service Dog.  Their training is extensive and Elliot is learning how to work specifically with me.  Our trainer Susanne believes that we can be a perfect match for each other!  <br/></p>
<p>I'm on Social Security Disability and I don't have a pension.  I have no family that can help me or live with me.  I'm doing my best to stay independent, to keep my home  and to stay out of the nursing home system.  And the best way for me to succeed at this is to get a Service Dog Partner and to ask you for your generous help.  Any funds that we receive over the $5,000.00 that is required for my new Service Dog will go towards future veterinary care, and if we are really Blessed - a very much needed new roof and a central air unit so that we can remain in our home and stay independent.  Thank You for helping me! <br/></p>
<p>I hope that you'll join our Team, tell all your friends and help us to move forward successfully!  </p>
<p><br/>All Our Best, Sue and Droopy (soon Elliot too!) </p>

About This Project
BlueBeary and Kathleen went on a big adventure to Toronto where they pitched to the Dragons in CBC-TV's Dragons' Den. It was a great experience and they learned a lot. Now we are ready for the next adventure.
After falling in love with BlueBeary through BlueBeary and Samantha's First Story, many of our fans are eager for another adventure with him. 
This next adventure is A Very BlueBeary Christmas. Grandpa comes to visit, but BlueBeary is missing. Samantha wants to take Grandpa and BlueBeary to school for a Show-and-Tell story. What will she do without her little friend?

Help Us Build Momentum


Did you know that a book becomes a bestseller in Canada at 5000 copies sold? As we plan the next book, our goal is to make it a bestseller. We want to be in at least 5000 homes, classrooms and libraries. How many copies can we sell before we start production in July? 500 is 10% of our goal. 1000 copies makes 20% ... Will you help us do it? See the perks on the right-hand side.

 
Help us build sales momentum for completing the Show-and-Tell series, in which Samantha must find a new story to share with her class every month. A Very BlueBeary Christmas is the second book in the series. We intend to publish a total of twelve books in this series, all focused on teaching children to tell excellent stories.
 
To kick off this bestseller, we are offering free shipping on advance sales, as well as some limited edition opportunities. Here are the levels (read descriptions on the right-hand side):

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Jordin Crow.  I am a Freshman at Arkansas State University and a member of Central Baptist Church in Jonesboro, AR.  Before college, I was raised by my wonderful parents and church in Hope, AR.  </p>
<h2>Why Canada</h2>
<p>I have been in multiple Mission Projects before this year, but they were all in my price range.  Because the cost for the Canada Mission Project is so high, I hesitated to sign up.  A day after the deadline, a friend talked to me and told me that he is raising about $6,000 to go to China.  He stated that he has total faith in God that He will provide.  He also said that the college years are the best years to be in a Mission Project because of the flexibility.</p>
<p>Very soon after talking to him, I got a text from a member of CBC stating they have one more spot open for someone to go and immediately, I said I will. I truly believe that God wants me to go on this project.</p>
<p>Calgary is the fastest growing city in Canada with the youngest population. Over 100,000 are university students, most of whom do not know Christ. There are few evangelical churches in the city and there is a need to start urban churches that would reach young adults, among others. </p>
<h2>In Canada</h2>
<p><span>The mission of this team will be to help the Church Planting Catalyst for Alberta determine opportunities to plant churches to reach young adults in the universities and downtown Calgary. The team will be at SAIT, University of Calgary, Bow Valley College and University of Alberta (downtown Calgary campus) sharing Christ, prayer walking, doing spiritual surveys, praying with people and meeting persons of peace. </span></p>
<p><span><span>Our team would be the first team to scout the city of Calgary in recent years. We are expecting God to open doors, minds and hearts to the gospel! Our t<span>eam will lay the foundation for many mission groups and church planters from different churches who will come and build on our efforts.</span></span></span></p>
<p>There will also be a day where the team will go snow skiing.</p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">The Impact</span></h3>
<p>This project is very important to me for two reasons: To see other college students come to know our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and to grow in Christ and come to love Him more and more as I serve him missionaly.</p>
<p>Your contributions will greatly impact the peoples' lives in Canada.  Through giving, you will be a part of something far greater than just me or CBC.  You will be a part of advancing the Kingdom of God and seeing lives come to know and love Jesus.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Goal &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal is $900.  With giving you will receive a letter via email March 25th showing all the results with pictures.  Soon after that, you will recive a video about the trip made by yours truly! Most importantly, I truly believe God will bless you for your generous gift.  (Philippians 4:14-20)</p>
<p>I have made a bank acount that holds all the money given to me for my mission funds.  Your money will go straight to that account.  I will personaly write down all the records of the acount.  If the money goes over the goal, I will save that money for future Mission Projects.</p>
<p>This website charges a 4% fee if I make the goal and 9% if I don't.  You will not be charged for it, only I will. </p>
<p>You have my word that I will use the money strictly for Missions.</p>

<h2>Pray, Pray, Pray</h2>
<p>Even if you can't give, I ask you to pray and to put this mission trip on the top of your prayer list.  Pray for me, pray for the team, pray for Calgary, Canada, pray for the people there, pray for the church plants, and pray for souls to be saved and people to know and love the God we love.  Prayer is very very powerful!  So above all, I ask you to pray!</p>

Our team would be the first team to scout the city of Calgary in recent years. We are expecting God to open doors, minds and hearts to the gospel! Our team will lay the foundation for many mission groups and church planters from different churches who will come and build on our efforts.
There will also be a day where the team will go snow skiing.

<h3>The Sons Trilogy:</h3>
<p>While I was writing Alabama Sons the ideas for two additional books came to me. Not necessarily extensions of the first since they won't be featuring the same main characters, but they will be part of the same story in the sense that you get to see the other characters stories and how they ended up in our original story (Think movies like ...

<p></p>
<p>I love my job (hello again bossman) but it doesn't really allow me the luxury to afford things like a top-notch editor, a virtual book tour, or even purchasing my own books for resale. </p>
<p>So...I need a little help! </p>
<p>The campaign was the idea of a few friends of mine, since I have too much pride to ask my parents for money (don't even pretend you can't relate!). It's mainly for the two next steps WHICH HAPPEN TO BE THE BIGGEST! (I'm shouting in joy - I promise.) Editing and the virtual book tour(s). </p>
<p>Editors cost money - but they're worth it. I'm sure you've seen plenty of mistakes here. Imagine 75,000 words ... The quotes are high, but I don't want to sacrifice this step. I simply can't. I want to put out the best product I possibly can! I wouldn't feel right about spending the last 6 months on this book and not giving it the proper shine-up it deserves. I mean ... I don't have kids, but I imagine it's like throwing your firstborn into a shark tank and praying they make it out alive. Nahhht gonna happen!</p>
<p>Virtual book tours cost money - but they're worth it. Imagine that you've just bought a prized pony (weirdo) and you spent a small fortune on him/her. Now what? Well, naturally you want to show him off! Thus, a virtual book tour. These tours are typically staggered in a month - to - month basis. Example the book release is scheduled (with your help) for a January release. This means for the months of January, February, and March the book will be reviewed and featured on 20+ book blogs per month. If you know nothing of blogs - this is HUGE - it means the book will have an estimated reach of over 10,000 people in the first few months. This isn't about sales, it's about total reach. I want nothing more than for a few people out of those 10,000 to see the book, grab the book, read the book, and then be able to find me to say that they were moved by the story. GAH! It's a writers DREAM!</p>

I need your help to make Unda Vosari: Legends a success.<br/><br/> This is not the kind of thing I enjoy writing and I dislike having to do so in any capacity.<br/><br/> I love being an author. Ever since I sat down and started toying with the idea of writing a novel about pirates, I fell in love with every aspect of Unda Vosari. The characters, the story, the setting and every other facet the Unda Vosari series is something I've enjoyed pouring my heart and soul into. There's very little I would change about Unda Vosari and there is nothing more that I would like than to keep writing. I want to tell an epic story about the world of Unda Vosari and every person in it, from kings and queens to pirates and merchants.<br/><br/> A lot of people have enjoyed hearing about me talk about what I've written and what goes into it and the ideas I've had. People have talked to me about what they liked, what they didn't like, how they enjoyed watching the characters evolve and the story grow. I've seen people boggle at how I've managed to create a half-dozen unique stories that run concurrently and weave into and out of each other and want to learn more, see exactly what the Unda Vosari series can grow into.<br/><br/> Right now, though, I'm facing a harsh decision and it's one I can't really make on my own.<br/><br/> Unda Vosari: Legends is good. I dare say it's potentially on the cusp of great, and I know it can be better. I want to be able to take what I've written to a professional editor that will look at every aspect of the novel, from the pace, flow and scope of the story down to spell-checking and proof-reading. They'll take what I've written and make it better. After that, I want to be able to take it to a professional marketing company and see to it that this polished work of art is put it where it's accessible to people who would enjoy reading not only the first novel but future novels as well. I want to be able to hold a book that's been reviewed by newspapers and magazines and say ""This newspaper thinks my book is great and they recommend it to everyone"" or ""This fantasy periodical has endorsed my novel as a great book to read.""<br/><br/> I need support to make all of this happen and bring a new series with an exciting, edgy and adventurous story to the literary world. What I need is a chance to push this series above and beyond what it's at right now. What I've done so far is only the beginning. People have only seen the bare bones of an entire series of novels I want to publish, and I have every desire to see it through to the very end, but I can't do it without your help.<br/><br/> I want to do all of that and more, but I can't do it myself.<br/><br/> I've spent years writing and rewriting and polishing and pushing myself to keep at it, because it's something I believe in. I want everybody else to believe in me too, which is why I'm asking for your help in bringing this novel to the world as something we can all be proud of. Every single person who donates to the project at $15 or more will have their name in the book with my own personal thank you. You will be immortalized as the ones who brought the first novel to the world and helped the beginning of an epic story I desperately want to see pushed to the end. I'm asking you, please... Pledge, share and let everyone know that there is a new fantasy series coming that you want to see succeed.<br/><br/> Without your support, I'm not going to be able to show the world what an epic series Unda Vosari can be.<br/><br/> Please go to this page and please share this post. Thank you to everybody for doing everything you can to help me continue doing the one thing I truly feel passionate about.</p>
<h3>What This Is</h3>
<p>Unda Vosari: Legends is the first novel I've written that I had been working on since 2007. Fantasy authors are in no short demand, so publishers are rather selective with whom they agree to publish. One novel has already been finished but gathering the funds for an editor, as well as promotional and printing costs, is far more than my meager pocketbook can sustain.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What this project is for is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding and hiring an editor for content and line editing.</li>
<li>Making sure the book is published with quality materials.</li>
<li>Most importantly, making sure that the book is publicized and distributed to a wide enough market that people that will enjoy the series have a chance to *find* the series.</li>
<li>Anyone and everyone that donates will certainly be able to contact me to find out how the process is going. Additionally, I am always interested in discussing the series (from character development to the setting to everything else that's part of the series).</li>
</ul><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please, get the word out and make some noise!</li>
<li>Even if you can't donate, that doesn't mean you can't urge me on. I'm always glad to get constructive criticism and have ample time on my hands between bursts of creativity.</li>
