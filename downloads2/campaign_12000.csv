""What's 'Synchronous'"" you might ask? ""Synchronous"" is a complex, character-driven drama with various sci-fi and philosophical elements thrown in for good measure. The main thrust of the story revolves around multiple worlds with the same basic setting: a Japanese scientist named Hideaki Moto invents mechanical exoskeletons that are capable of increasing a man's strength and speed tenfold, intended to help policemen, firefighters, and other people in dangerous jobs. Unfortunately, the world's militaries corrupt Moto's benevolent vision, and create weaponized versions to wage war with one another. Despite protests from Moto and the public, the United Nations does nothing, forcing Moto to enact a failsafe on his suits that requires people to have a specific gene on their ""X""-chromosome to be able to pilot the machines. After enacting his failsafe, Moto disappears from the public eye. In the following years, the UN establishes testing protocols (girls at tested at the age of 8, boys are tested at the age of 13 to give the gene more time to present itself), divides the world into 5 regions (Europe, Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Oceania) and implements teaching infrastructure in all of them, and also establishes a ranking system to better gauge the ability of young pilots. The rarest of all of the rankings is ""Ace"", and only a handful exist around the world. The standard way to earn the ranking of ""Ace"" is to excel as a pilot either in combat or in the competitive tournaments that are held each year.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello Everyone, Cesar ""El Guapo"" Feliciano here to let you know a little something about myself.</p>
<p>I have been making comics in the independent market for nearly 26 years. From horror comics Like the Captain's Jolting Tales and Full Moon Craze to Super Hero comics like The Red Ten I just love making comics!</p>
<p>I love to tell stories and have told other peoples stories for a long time. Now I am focused on creating my own comics, with characters that have lived in my own head and heart. Chango is the first of my creator-owned comic that I want to share with you all. It is a story with heart, humor, and horror, based on actual events from my childhood.</p>
<p>It is a personal story but relatable to all comics fans that have experienced the bond of a mother's love for her child.</p>

<p>In order to make sure that this story gets told in the best way possible, I have enlisted a few friends. First up is the writer and co-creator Ben Goldsmith, writer and creator of The Seance Room,  Ben has been writing for a long time and creates a beautiful tapestry with his characterizations that bring them all to life. On colors, we have the colorist for the Action Labs and Ringo Award-nominated hit Spencer and Lock. Rounding out the team is letterer Justin Birch who has lettered books for IDW and Action Labs.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'll keep it very simple here if you missed out on the first campaign I am making available the opportunity for you to get your hands on your own copy of Chango The Broken Veil part 1.</p>
<p>That is a 56-page full-color Graphic novel so you can join us on this special journey.</p>
<p>If we hit a certain goal I may introduce some stretch goals but we'll have to see how that goes.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contributions will help me to get this story out to a greater and wider audience. I initially attempted to run the campaign here on Indiegogo but things did not go as planned so the decision was made to go over to Kickstarter to see if we could fund there.</p>
<p>Many stepped up to the plate to make the initial campaign successful over on Kickstarter and we met and exceeded our goal. </p>
<p>While happy for the successful funding I felt as if there was a section of the audience that did not get served. Perhaps I did not do a good enough job promoting my IndieGoGo campaign. This is why I am here to give it another go and with your help, I can get this book into the hands of new fans.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are not really any risks other than missing out on this second chance to get Chango! The book will be printed. The art is done, The colors are almost complete and the lettering is well on its way. I simply want to get the book into more hands and I know it can be added into the print run when it is time.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand that times and circumstances are different for all people. If you can contribute and be a part of the team then great! If however you cannot, sharing on your social media is another great way that you can be a part of team Chango!</p>
<p>I look forward to all the great stories over this campaign. </p>

 My name is Robert and I'm a comic book creator based in London. I've worked on several comics so far.
 Black Duchess is a really cool story that I came up with when I was trapped in quarantine. I knew that when it was over I wanted to create something meaningful. More than even people need something to be inspired by, something fun that can keep peoples minds off of all the terrible things that are going on in the world.  To excite people and make them laugh that is my main concern. People need to learn how to have fun again. 
 Contributors to Black Duchess will have a direct impact in supporting independent comic books. The comic book industry is dominated by monopolies stacked on top of monopolies. It's enough of a statement to be helping more art be created.

<h3>It's Not Too Late </h3>
<p>COVID-19, the coronavirus, is spreading around the world. Many governments have been slow to take appropriate actions to protect public health. Many private citizens still don't understand the danger to them and their loved ones. Misinformation is everywhere. <br/><br/>Many people find themselves working from home. For those of you who don't know us, we're <a href=""https://nicolemariecomix.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hugh and Nicole</a>, a husband and wife, artist and writer team based in Ottawa, Canada. As working comics artists, we're used to sitting around the house, but we've rarely felt so frustrated, so powerless. We want to do something to help get the word out with a short, full colour, digital comic that can be shared on social media, sent in e-mails and displayed in public areas. We're thinking of something 3-5 pages long, depending on the success of this crowdfunded, that covers what the virus is, its recent history, how to prevent it, what kind of a response we need from policymakers, and what we can do for each other. </p>
<p>We're hoping that we can spread the word about the dangers of the virus, and the importance of social distancing, as quickly as possible. We know from experience that comics reach audiences that other media can't. We do this for a living and we're confident we can do a great job.  We want to provide a resource to help people answer questions, a handout to influence public discussion and hey, a beautiful piece of art while we're at it. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>We Need Your Help</h3>
<p>We're not asking for much. Since this is urgent, we're looking to be paid $400 a page in Canadian dollars, which is much less than our current professional rate. Research, writing and illustration take between 20-25 hours per page, so this works out to about $17 an hour for us. For research, we'll rely on Health Canada and the CDC for information about the virus and best practices. For background on how it's developed in Italy, we'll rely on credible news organizations. The final section, on making a difference, will come from our own activist networks. <br/><br/>For the comic to make sense, we think it needs to be three pages long:</p>
<p>1) A page about the virus and its effects on people<br/>2) A page about its impact in Italy<br/>3) A page about what people can do to help.<br/><br/>Ideally, we would like to make the comic five pages long. This means we're hoping to raise at least $1,200 CDN, and ideally $2,000 CDN, to cover the cost of our labor. If we can raise $2,000, then we'll add two more pages. Page 3 will become about social distancing, hand-washing etc, and we'll add</p>
<p>4) A page explaining that the government needs to invest in health care, close workplaces, ban evictions and suspend rent and mortgage payments. </p>
<p>5) A page about the kind of social solidarity work people are already doing to support one another, and what folks can do to get involved in that work. </p>
<p>As long as we raise at least $400, we'll produce a one page comic with a compressed message. We're confident we can do better than that, but if we don't, we'll refund donations. Over that amount, we'll produce another page for every $400 til we get to $2,000. </p>
<p>That's already a lot, and we'd be thrilled to hit our goal! But if we're able to pass it, for every additional $400 we raise, we'll do a short one-page comic spotlighting an inspiring example of social solidarity or community care related to this crisis. We know that there are amazing people putting their time and energy into helping their neighbours survive and we'd be honoured to spotlight that work.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>There's A Lot At Stake</h3>
<p>This comic is only a small part of the enormous global effort it's going to take to contain the virus. But as people take to social media to brag about how they're still going to bars and many workplaces remain open, it's clear that many people still don't understand how dangerous this situation is. Supporting this comic, even a little bit, can help us go a long way towards encouraging people and governments to respond appropriately.  </p>
<p>We know things are urgent - that's why this crowdfunder is ten days long instead of the usual month. But we won't wait for the crowdfunder to end - we'll start work on the project as soon as we've raised enough money to cover the first three pages.  </p>

</div></div>","It's Not Too Late 
COVID-19, the coronavirus, is spreading around the world. Many governments have been slow to take appropriate actions to protect public health. Many private citizens still don't understand the danger to them and their loved ones. Misinformation is everywhere. Many people find themselves working from home. For those of you who don't know us, we're Hugh and Nicole, a husband and wife, artist and writer team based in Ottawa, Canada. As working comics artists, we're used to sitting around the house, but we've rarely felt so frustrated, so powerless. We want to do something to help get the word out with a short, full colour, digital comic that can be shared on social media, sent in e-mails and displayed in public areas. We're thinking of something 3-5 pages long, depending on the success of this crowdfunded, that covers what the virus is, its recent history, how to prevent it, what kind of a response we need from policymakers, and what we can do for each other. 
We're hoping that we can spread the word about the dangers of the virus, and the importance of social distancing, as quickly as possible. We know from experience that comics reach audiences that other media can't. We do this for a living and we're confident we can do a great job.  We want to provide a resource to help people answer questions, a handout to influence public discussion and hey, a beautiful piece of art while we're at it. 

We Need Your Help
We're not asking for much. Since this is urgent, we're looking to be paid $400 a page in Canadian dollars, which is much less than our current professional rate. Research, writing and illustration take between 20-25 hours per page, so this works out to about $17 an hour for us. For research, we'll rely on Health Canada and the CDC for information about the virus and best practices. For background on how it's developed in Italy, we'll rely on credible news organizations. The final section, on making a difference, will come from our own activist networks. For the comic to make sense, we think it needs to be three pages long:
1) A page about the virus and its effects on people2) A page about its impact in Italy3) A page about what people can do to help.Ideally, we would like to make the comic five pages long. This means we're hoping to raise at least $1,200 CDN, and ideally $2,000 CDN, to cover the cost of our labor. If we can raise $2,000, then we'll add two more pages. Page 3 will become about social distancing, hand-washing etc, and we'll add
4) A page explaining that the government needs to invest in health care, close workplaces, ban evictions and suspend rent and mortgage payments. 
5) A page about the kind of social solidarity work people are already doing to support one another, and what folks can do to get involved in that work. 
As long as we raise at least $400, we'll produce a one page comic with a compressed message. We're confident we can do better than that, but if we don't, we'll refund donations. Over that amount, we'll produce another page for every $400 til we get to $2,000. 
That's already a lot, and we'd be thrilled to hit our goal! But if we're able to pass it, for every additional $400 we raise, we'll do a short one-page comic spotlighting an inspiring example of social solidarity or community care related to this crisis. We know that there are amazing people putting their time and energy into helping their neighbours survive and we'd be honoured to spotlight that work.

There's A Lot At Stake
This comic is only a small part of the enormous global effort it's going to take to contain the virus. But as people take to social media to brag about how they're still going to bars and many workplaces remain open, it's clear that many people still don't understand how dangerous this situation is. Supporting this comic, even a little bit, can help us go a long way towards encouraging people and governments to respond appropriately.  
We know things are urgent - that's why this crowdfunder is ten days long instead of the usual month. But we won't wait for the crowdfunder to end - we'll start work on the project as soon as we've raised enough money to cover the first three pages.

<p>Worried he's going crazy and the girl is merely a figment of his guilty conscience, M.C. finds a support group for train operators suffering post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD.) Nina accompanies him to the group, all the while insisting she is real. But soon, MC and Nina discover they are not alone: all the conductors in the group are also being haunted by people they killed. Some were admitted suicides, some were unfortunate accidents, but all the ghosts are having trouble figuring out what they need to do to “cross over.” Instead of PTSD, the support group is paranormal “couples counseling” as the ghosts and engineers try to figure out how to conduct the ghosts to their final rest. </p>

<h3>ISSUE #1</h3>
<p>After a meet-cute with a locomotive, DARC train engineer, M.C. Tejada, is haunted by the ghost of Nina Goldman, a goth girl with a grudge. He says her death was suicide, She knows she was murdered, and not by the poor guy who ran her over. The  relationship is a roller coaster of pain for both parties, but Nina is  convinced she would never have killed herself and she can't cross over  until M.C. helps her solve her case.</p>

<h3>ISSUE#2</h3>
<p>The paranormal odd couple stumble onto a support group of ghosts and  hosts in the same predicament: people stuck together by circumstance and  trying to move on with their (after)lives. The hosts have a working  theory that they can find a way for the ghosts to break on through to  the other side, but nothing has done it yet. ""Conscious uncoupling"" gets  a whole new look as we learn more about the ghosts run to ground and  the Conductors doing their best to figure out how to help.</p>

ISSUE #1
After a meet-cute with a locomotive, DARC train engineer, M.C. Tejada, is haunted by the ghost of Nina Goldman, a goth girl with a grudge. He says her death was suicide, She knows she was murdered, and not by the poor guy who ran her over. The  relationship is a roller coaster of pain for both parties, but Nina is  convinced she would never have killed herself and she can't cross over  until M.C. helps her solve her case.





 

ISSUE#2
The paranormal odd couple stumble onto a support group of ghosts and  hosts in the same predicament: people stuck together by circumstance and  trying to move on with their (after)lives. The hosts have a working  theory that they can find a way for the ghosts to break on through to  the other side, but nothing has done it yet. ""Conscious uncoupling"" gets  a whole new look as we learn more about the ghosts run to ground and  the Conductors doing their best to figure out how to help.

 


 


ISSUE #3
While Nina is focused on solving her dead/undead predicament, the  family she left behind is struggling through grief. Nicole believes her sister committed suicide and nothing and no one seems to be able to help  her cope.



 

ISSUE #4 
The ghosts begin to piece together clues that  might help two of them finally cross over. They just have to do a little  more to convince their hosts they’re onto something.

 
ISSUE #5
The plan is set in motion... until Nina's little sister crosses unwittingly into danger and some undead elements from Vince's past may threaten to derail the whole thing. Now it's up to this ad-hoc team of conductors to keep this train from flying off track. The ghosts are already dead; their living counterparts may be next!

<li>My name is Wesley, And for years I've always wanted to own something that was my own and run my own business. I've been passionate like most people to leave there mark on something even if it's only small. I want my hard work and the work of my contributors to pay off for this awesome project</li>
<li>What I want to do is simple and cost effective. There are a lot of subscription services out there at the moment within the Box Industry such as loot crate and birch box.

With my Idea you will be able to purchase A Funko PoP head toy and a Top at low cost in a small  box for a once off price. I am a huge gamer and a film buff and I know the importance of wanting something geeky and fun and not having to spend a lot of money for it. REMEMBER - It's cost effective and fun.</li>
<li>I have sourced my Products of Geeky fun and madness and now I need your help. I don't require thousands to be donated, I just need your help so I can spread this awesome product of Nerd and Geekiness to the world. So go on. What are you waiting for. I promise you, It will be worth it</li>

</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>This is something that I have always wanted to achieve. It's personal and nothing shouts security like a business who always strives to add the personal touch to everything we do which is why this venture will pay off. It speaks for itself and you can wake up knowing that the little venture that was once an idea, a little seed on indiegogo has now grown and flourished into something that has had a lot of work put in to it to succeed.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Problems. It's a word that is thrown around very loosely. When you are passionate about something a problem is not just that. It's a learning curve. In order for a business to succeed it's important to know your risks. Your cons. and how ultimately you will over come this. At the time of writing. Shipping and Packaging was a big problem. It was difficult to overcome this and work around it but we did. with open contracts now available for us Using Registered Courier Services we are now able to approach this with ease and not worry about the hidden costs that would be placed on large parcels. Hey we are only a small box it actually worked out cheaper for us (By Bribing everyone with a Funko PoP), But in all seriousness we adapted and will continue to face every thing head on, Positivity is key and we will succeed.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Not everyone can donate and we here @ PoP&amp;ToP totally understand that, So how about helping us in other ways. Sharing the love of our Geeky goodness would be great on helping us achieve exposure. Put it on Facebook, Instagram, Blogs ,you name it, you place it. We love for you guys, our hopefully soon to be valued customers to share to the world and show everyone that we mean business and we are here to make you all happy.</li></ul>
</div><p>Thanks for reading. We hope to hear any feedback you guys may have and we hope to have your continued support along the way.</p><p>Thank you in advance from PoP&amp;ToP</p><p> </p><p>**</p><p>1 EURO/GBP/DOLLAR GOES A LONG WAY - Even small amounts help us grow.</p></div>","Funko PoP and a ToP - 20%of Profits raised Goes to Homelessness In Ireland

This is something that I have always wanted to achieve. It's personal and nothing shouts security like a business who always strives to add the personal touch to everything we do which is why this venture will pay off. It speaks for itself and you can wake up knowing that the little venture that was once an idea, a little seed on indiegogo has now grown and flourished into something that has had a lot of work put in to it to succeed.

Risks & Challenges
 
Problems. It's a word that is thrown around very loosely. When you are passionate about something a problem is not just that. It's a learning curve. In order for a business to succeed it's important to know your risks. Your cons. and how ultimately you will over come this. At the time of writing. Shipping and Packaging was a big problem. It was difficult to overcome this and work around it but we did. with open contracts now available for us Using Registered Courier Services we are now able to approach this with ease and not worry about the hidden costs that would be placed on large parcels. Hey we are only a small box it actually worked out cheaper for us (By Bribing everyone with a Funko PoP), But in all seriousness we adapted and will continue to face every thing head on, Positivity is key and we will succeed.

A young man inspired by long talks with his neighbor, the legendary Jack “King” Kirby, this one-time Marvel intern had his big break in 1974 when a series writer missed a deadline for his Deadly Hands of Kung Fu script. Delivering a fill-in script almost immediately, Mantlo proved his writing chops and work ethic, and soon became an indispensable staff member known for taking on any writing challenge with enthusiasm – no matter what the concept was or how impending the deadline.</p><p>Over the next 18 years, Mantlo would write over 500 comic books for Marvel Comics, sometimes as many as eight titles a month! Among his many writing accomplishments, he wrote celebrated runs on Marvel mainstays like Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man and The Incredible Hulk, and built a well-deserved reputation as a pioneer of licensed comics. Two such titles – Micronauts and Rom: SpaceKnight – were based on toy properties with little backstory for their characters; Mantlo built entire universes around the concepts, far-flung worlds and rich personalities that remained popular with fans (and profitable for Marvel) long after the original toys disappeared from store shelves. His penchant for cosmic storytelling led to the creation of Rocket Raccoon and, of course, Swords of the Swashbucklers.</p><p>Furthermore, Mantlo stood up for the “little guy.” He championed creator rights, attempting to build a union for writers and artists. While employed at Marvel, he earned a law degree and served as a public defender. He joined social causes and participated in peaceful protests. Considering his ambition, likeable personality, and political activism, many of his peers predicted a career in government on the horizon.</p><p><strong>What ended Bill Mantlo’s career?</strong></p><p>On July 17, 1992, Bill Mantlo was rollerblading on the streets of New York City when he was the victim of a terrible hit-and-run accident. He suffered a closed-head brain injury that severely impaired his mobility and fine motor skills. For the past twenty years, he has resided in a Queens rehabilitation center, where he communicates in simple, labored sentences, and staff must assist with nearly all his physical activities. With unwavering support from his brother and legal guardian Mike Mantlo, as well as health care professionals, he survives a daily struggle with severe cognitive and memory impairment.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495052908/zcsakvs33wmm4cdw4tke.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Dynamite Entertainment will publish Swords of the Swashbucklers as a full-color, fully remastered volume over 400 pages in length, containing the complete story from all thirteen issues (Marvel Graphic Novel #14, plus Swashbucklers #1-12).

<p>Little Porcupine is painfully fearful due to being alone in

gives Little Porcupine a horrible side effect, systemic lupus erythemetosus. Worse
disease you can have next to cancer. More drugs like steroids and tranquilizers
are added which complicate the situation. The doctors do nothing but make
things worse. Little Porcupine seeks help at the hospital but that only turns
into a two year long misadventure with total insomnia. There are many
interesting if not shocking animal patients that Little Porcupine meets. Doctors
keep her on the steroid which is causing her mania and then declare her
incompetent in a mock trial!! The “experts” do not expect her to ever function
again.</p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">MY STORY CONTINUES.</span><br/></p>
<p>I'm a New York advertising and marketing executive that grew up in an entertainment family. My father was an talented entertainer and my mother was a brilliant, funny, passionate gal with big attitude whose parents owned and operated a New York Catskill Mountain resort.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My schooling was marketing and engineering and upon graduation I went to work for a real estate /resort developer as advertising and marketing manager.             Four years later  I opened my own advertising and marketing agency with my Swedish wife, Asa Kristina.</span></p>
<p>We have been in business 40 plus years marketing products and services including resorts, real estate, health products, events and charitable causes. Our firm helped clients attain sales success and we won several creative awards. Our clients included Fortune 500 companies, governments  and entrepreneurs.<br/></p>
<p>We were among the founders of timeshare, conversion  of rental apartments to condominiums and sponsoring international property expos in Europe and the Far East. We established an office in London and I was deemed the 'Mel Brooks' of American real estate. </p>
<p>Working with a team of property professionals, environmentalists, planners and architects we created plans for 'A New Century Habitat', an eco-friendly resort city of the future in south Texas. It included innovative ideas based on building green       and healthy.</p>
<p>We worked with the United Nations to create an affordable housing program bringing together the public and private sectors to develop sustainable communities. That effort led me to meet worldwide leaders.                                          One brilliant and kind person was King Sheikh Anwar Mahmoud Mekkeen,            King of the Nubia and its Provinces in The Sudan. In July, 2001 he honored me     with a Knighthood given my help to him and United Nations work. </p>
<p>My wife and I were among the first to enter China after President Nixon in 1978.    We presented an international marketing plan for the Chinese government.            The invitation from China was initiated by me writing a humorous letter to Chairman Mao in 1973. </p>
<p>My AHAH moment to utilize my experience and skills to help others                        came in March 2010.</p>
<p> A routine cat scan gave evidence to an oncologist I was in deep caca. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">She told me: ""Ken you have cancer. You have a tumor the size of a soccer ball in your abdomen and it's Non Hodgkins Follicular Lymphoma."" </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> I was feeling fine and asked : ""Should I sell my Brooklyn Dodger baseball card collection and could you cut out the soccer ball and donate it to a soccer organization.""  I was told: ""Ken, you are too cavalier and should pay more attention to your serious circumstances and stop laughing""</span></p>
<p>I felt her approach lacked a critical element I needed - humor and a positive attitude. But alas what she told me was the truth.  </p>
<p>The wake up call turned out to be a blessing.                                                                                     </p>
<p>It motivated me to write my book and provide the opportunity to use my marketing skills and experience to help myself and others understand the value of humor and laughter as a healing therapy.                     </p>
<p><br/></p>

<br/>
<p>After the book was published a passionate group of people appeared with the shared belief that humor can be a powerful tool in the healing process.                          It  became evident the book should be made into a comedy movie to reach millions.</p>
<p> OUR GOAL.  Create a quality laugh out loud comedy  film that is also inspirational to all dealing with serious health issues.</p>

Hi, I'm Ken Miller author of Enter Crying, Exit Laughing.                                                          I wrote the book to  illustrate the humorous experiences I had dealing with cancer and other health challeges.  Writing the book cracked me up and made my journey with cancer and it's side effects easier. 
Enter Crying, Exit Laughing is about my time in hospital emergency and operating rooms, laboratories, waiting rooms, hospital beds, ambulances and taxi-cabs.
Readers commented the book was hilarious and inspirational. That  convinced me and my supporters my humor message is a must to reach many more people by having a comedy movie adapted from the book.
We need you to be a Co-Producer to accomplish our goal to retain a top comedy    screen writer to write an A quality screen play that will attract other A team professionals.

Ken Miller has taken healing and made it fun,        the world is looking for great advice now and humor is the way to go!""                        MD Stephanie Kabongo, Natural Health  & Holistic Medicine, New Zealand
MY STORY CONTINUES.
I'm a New York advertising and marketing executive that grew up in an entertainment family. My father was an talented entertainer and my mother was a brilliant, funny, passionate gal with big attitude whose parents owned and operated a New York Catskill Mountain resort.
My schooling was marketing and engineering and upon graduation I went to work for a real estate /resort developer as advertising and marketing manager.             Four years later  I opened my own advertising and marketing agency with my Swedish wife, Asa Kristina.
We have been in business 40 plus years marketing products and services including resorts, real estate, health products, events and charitable causes. Our firm helped clients attain sales success and we won several creative awards. Our clients included Fortune 500 companies, governments  and entrepreneurs.
We were among the founders of timeshare, conversion  of rental apartments to condominiums and sponsoring international property expos in Europe and the Far East. We established an office in London and I was deemed the 'Mel Brooks' of American real estate. 
Working with a team of property professionals, environmentalists, planners and architects we created plans for 'A New Century Habitat', an eco-friendly resort city of the future in south Texas. It included innovative ideas based on building green       and healthy.
We worked with the United Nations to create an affordable housing program bringing together the public and private sectors to develop sustainable communities. That effort led me to meet worldwide leaders.                                          One brilliant and kind person was King Sheikh Anwar Mahmoud Mekkeen,            King of the Nubia and its Provinces in The Sudan. In July, 2001 he honored me     with a Knighthood given my help to him and United Nations work. 
My wife and I were among the first to enter China after President Nixon in 1978.    We presented an international marketing plan for the Chinese government.            The invitation from China was initiated by me writing a humorous letter to Chairman Mao in 1973. 
My AHAH moment to utilize my experience and skills to help others                        came in March 2010.
 A routine cat scan gave evidence to an oncologist I was in deep caca. She told me: ""Ken you have cancer. You have a tumor the size of a soccer ball in your abdomen and it's Non Hodgkins Follicular Lymphoma."" 
 I was feeling fine and asked : ""Should I sell my Brooklyn Dodger baseball card collection and could you cut out the soccer ball and donate it to a soccer organization.""  I was told: ""Ken, you are too cavalier and should pay more attention to your serious circumstances and stop laughing""
I felt her approach lacked a critical element I needed - humor and a positive attitude. But alas what she told me was the truth.  
The wake up call turned out to be a blessing.                                                                                     
It motivated me to write my book and provide the opportunity to use my marketing skills and experience to help myself and others understand the value of humor and laughter as a healing therapy.                     



After the book was published a passionate group of people appeared with the shared belief that humor can be a powerful tool in the healing process.                          It  became evident the book should be made into a comedy movie to reach millions.
 OUR GOAL.  Create a quality laugh out loud comedy  film that is also inspirational to all dealing with serious health issues.
ONLY YOU, OUR SUPPORTERS CAN HELP US ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS. 
We have a hand shake agreement with a  multi-talented screenwriter/director.
We are seeking $15,000 and will use the funds to retain our chosen screen writer / director.   Our timing is perfect given he is between two movies and can focus on our book to movie.
Your contribution will allow us to have a finished screen play by the end of 2015.
Also in not a pain in touches we would like you to get the word out about the campaign  to your contacts in the real world and via social media.
Thank you- Sir Ken Miller",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>E-Mortal - What Is It About?</h3>
<p><i><strong>E-Mortal</strong> is a dark noir that follows a private detective living in an overcrowded, overpopulated world where people can no longer die, who is thrown into a deep rabbit hole of corruption, lies and cover-ups when he stumbles across the fresh corpse of a young woman during one of his cases.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Team!</h3>
<p>This thrilling series was created by award-winning screenwriter and internationally published graphic novel author Mitch Smith (<i>True Terror, Hell-Bound</i>) and accomplished illustrator Cristian David Narravo (Markosia Enterprises, Hellbound Media, Aphotic Realm Magazine) with the help of Letterer Nikki Powers (<i>Red Winter, Cover of Darkness, The Fist, Nightlight, Phantom Squad #2-3</i>) </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Whole Story</h3>
<p>The first volume in the <i><strong>E-Mortal</strong></i> series will encompass a complete story arc through 8 issues of 21 pages each, which we hope to eventually fund through campaigns like this. For now, however, the first issue is completed and will be released for free along with our campaign to raise funds for Issue #2!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>E-Mortal</strong></i> is a high-concept sci-fi noir that examines and explores life, death, the afterlife (or lack thereof) and compels readers to consider mortality and humanity through a thrilling, unpredictable mystery full of dark twists and turns on every page.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our team has been working diligently on this project for several years, and recently we have been pitching it around the comic book industry to try to find a home for the project. Though there was lots of interest and we received several offers, our team just felt that going the traditional publishing route was not right for this project.</p>
<p>See, we wanted to bring this timely, exciting story to the largest possible audience, which is why we are releasing the entire first issue for free here and on our social media. We would love to continue to do this with the series, so that people all around the world can read and share the story, but we cannot do this alone!</p>
<p>We have had such generous donations from the crowdfunding community in the past, which allowed our team to fund and produce True Terror Volume #1 and release it internationally through Zone Komics! That series did well enough that the series has been renewed for a second volume which is scheduled to hit shelves next year!</p>
<p>We cannot do this alone, but our team believes in this story, and with your help, we will be able to share it with the world!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with every crowdfunding campaign, there is a risk that we will not reach our goal in time. However, due to our previous success crowdfunding a comic series, the comparably low ask (we are only looking to fund one issue instead of a whole series at the moment) and our reach (thousands of social media followers &amp; connections with lots of comic book industry professionals) we are very confident in our ability to succeed and to get this project fully funded!</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you like the series, but just don't have the money available to donate, not to worry! There are lots of things you can do to help keep this project going and support us!</p>

<br/><h3>The history of this work</h3>
<p>In June 2000, the 39th international contest of cartoons on any topic was held in the Belgian town of Knokke-Heist. At the same time, the European Championship in football etween Belgium and the Netherlands also took place. The organizers of the caricature contest announced an additional competition for the football theme. It turned out that the international jury awarded prizes for my work in both competitions. </p>
<p>Out of more than 500 cartoonists, I was awarded the ""Culture Prize"" in the main competition and also won third place in the competition with the football theme. As far as I know, never in the history of awards in international competitions, either before or after the event, did it happen that the same person garnered more than one prize. So it's a caricature acquired its own unique history.</p>

<p><b>ABOUT ME</b></p>
<p>I'm Alexandre Piacsek, an artist based in southeast England with over 20 years of experience, having previously worked as a teacher of comics and sequential art in private schools. Mainly influenced by the highly imaginative French <i>Bandes Dessinées</i> and by the American Golden Age of Comics, I have been showcasing my work in London galleries and collective art exhibitions since 2012, such as <b>Illustrated 2015 </b>in Brick Lane and <b>Spark, The Best of Emergent Art</b> coming this year. <b>The Light at the Top of the world </b>will be my debut graphic novel, a project I've been planning for a long time. </p>

<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">THE STORYBOARD</b></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">It took me 6 months to write the story. The storyboard was entirely drawn on the train in 3 sketchbooks, during my travels from Eastbourne to London, from june to november 2015 ( I found train journeys across England the best way to unleash creative inspiration!)  I will use different layouts for the graphic novel, alternating from the </span>classic to innovative panel designs.</p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The story begins with the narrative of Joshua Clark, an eminent New York shipbuilder from 1850's Manhattan who ventures into the west to take part in the California Gold Rush.

<p></p>
<p>The potential discovery of Joshua's ""Ship of Gold"" attracts a wave of treasure hunters, but many of them are not willing to venture into the frozen and perilous Baffin Bay waters; except two men: the Londoner Baron Frank Buckman and his rival the captain Pierre Lafitte, who will meet in the Arctic at some point at the Light at the Top of the World - where new mysteries and secrets surrounding the lighthouse and the disappearance of ""The Ship of Gold"" will emerge.</p>
<p>The Light at the Top of the World takes place across several locations around the world, introducing a new set of characters that will bring complexity and depth into the story. Additionally, the inclusion in the novel of events will enthral the readers, expanding the plot into a mythical world. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455988643/zo1leiovubfvdvvij6vi.jpg"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""/></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong><i>A Place to hang Your Cape: What inspired you to create this story?</i></strong></p>
<p><i><strong>Piacsek:</strong> Real and fictitious stories and legends of adventurers, explorers, globe-trotting fortune-hunters, and my moving to England in 2013 where I can feel the Arctic winds howling in my studio’s window.  A powerful influence and the genesis of the graphic novel’s name is the movie <strong>The Light at the Edge of the World</strong>. Its a 1971 action &amp; adventure film adapted from <strong>Jules Verne</strong>‘s classic adventure novel Le Phare du bout du monde, when pirates take over a lighthouse on a rocky island in the South Atlantic during the mid-19th century, but the iron-willed light-keeper played by <strong>Kirk Douglas</strong> fights their plot</i></p>
<p><strong style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-style: italic;""><i><strong><i>A Place to hang Your Cape: </i></strong>What is the biggest challenge you’ve had to face while creating this project?</i></strong><br/></p>
<p><i><strong>Piacsek:</strong> To write an intriguing plot that would feel real and simultaneously fantastic to the reader. I’ve strived to create a cohesive narrative intertwined with historical events such as the California Gold Rush and the discovery of the Northwest Passage sea route, also linked with the settings of Victorian London and the Arctic world. To inject detail into my work, I did a lot of web research and used several books, looking for countless images and information. I love highly detailed comics.</i></p>
<p><strong><i><strong><i>A Place to hang Your Cape: </i></strong>I’ve noticed that you’re already finished writing the sequel. Is that going to be the end of the project, or would you like to expand it further? Any chance of spin-offs, prequels, or additional sequels?</i></strong></p>
<p><i><strong>Piacsek:</strong> No, this is not the end! The Lost Adventures of Baron Buckman series crosses space and time, and I will keep expanding and exploring the Baron Buckman’s universe, introducing at every new episode new characters, themes and exploits. The sequel of The Light at the Top of the World will take part mainly in India, but also in Okinawa/Japan, Indochina, and London, and will bring the new line-up of Jon Strider and the Trackers. This second volume is filled with martial arts combat, desert races, endless journeys across vanished temples, and encounters with supernatural beings and ancient Gods.</i></p>
<p><b>THE TEAM</b></p>
<p>Its just me! The story, penciling, inking, colouring, lettering , graphic design, and the cover art... Its my way of working, to be in control throughout the entire process. It took me many years to fully develop my drawing technique and <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I want the graphic novel to be in accordance with my artistic style. My work is very </span>original in the sense that all artwork is made with brush &amp; Indian Ink, including the balloons - I only use the computer for colouring and lettering. This is why it will take me around 6 months to finish the 56 pages of the book. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">But if I surpass my funding goal I will be able to hire a colourist I can trust.</span></p>
<p><b>PAGES PREVIEW</b><br/></p>

THE LIGHT AT THE TOP OF THE WORLD ! 

{ THE LOST ADVENTURES OF BARON BUCKMAN - VOLUME  1 }



The Light at the Top of the World Graphic Novel is the account of the extraordinary and supernatural adventures of Baron Frank Buckman and his crew in a remote lighthouse in the Arctic, searching for a lost shipwreck and gold in the glaciers and wastelands of Greenland. Sailing from Victorian London to the frozen waters of Baffin Bay, this original riveting story will take you to the vaults and secrets of a mysterious and gigantic watchtower at the top of the world. A plot that crosses space and time, driven by Quest, Adventure, Discovery, Riddle, Rivalry, and ultimately Transformation. The Graphic Novel is my homage to the greatest adventurers and explorers of all time.


ABOUT ME
I'm Alexandre Piacsek, an artist based in southeast England with over 20 years of experience, having previously worked as a teacher of comics and sequential art in private schools. Mainly influenced by the highly imaginative French Bandes Dessinées and by the American Golden Age of Comics, I have been showcasing my work in London galleries and collective art exhibitions since 2012, such as Illustrated 2015 in Brick Lane and Spark, The Best of Emergent Art coming this year. The Light at the Top of the world will be my debut graphic novel, a project I've been planning for a long time. 


THE STORYBOARD
It took me 6 months to write the story. The storyboard was entirely drawn on the train in 3 sketchbooks, during my travels from Eastbourne to London, from june to november 2015 ( I found train journeys across England the best way to unleash creative inspiration!)  I will use different layouts for the graphic novel, alternating from the classic to innovative panel designs.






THE STORY
The story begins with the narrative of Joshua Clark, an eminent New York shipbuilder from 1850's Manhattan who ventures into the west to take part in the California Gold Rush. On the wild frontier, he builds a mining town and strikes it rich, marries Mary Black a local saloon dancer - but then gets his mining business ravaged by bandits, forcing him to escape with a fortune in gold bars and coins along the Pacific Coast aboard his schooner Surprise. Joshua will never return to New York... his whereabouts remain unknown, until 20 years later rumours about a strange Arctic lighthouse and a mysterious shipwreck carrying the flag of the Surprise, are news all over the world.

The potential discovery of Joshua's ""Ship of Gold"" attracts a wave of treasure hunters, but many of them are not willing to venture into the frozen and perilous Baffin Bay waters; except two men: the Londoner Baron Frank Buckman and his rival the captain Pierre Lafitte, who will meet in the Arctic at some point at the Light at the Top of the World - where new mysteries and secrets surrounding the lighthouse and the disappearance of ""The Ship of Gold"" will emerge.
The Light at the Top of the World takes place across several locations around the world, introducing a new set of characters that will bring complexity and depth into the story. Additionally, the inclusion in the novel of events will enthral the readers, expanding the plot into a mythical world. 
I recently gave an INTERVIEW to Alex Reale, staff editor at A PLACE TO HANG YOUR CAPE , where I talked about all my creative process behind the story and the planned sequel. Excerpts from the interview :

A Place to hang Your Cape: What inspired you to create this story?
Piacsek: Real and fictitious stories and legends of adventurers, explorers, globe-trotting fortune-hunters, and my moving to England in 2013 where I can feel the Arctic winds howling in my studio’s window.  A powerful influence and the genesis of the graphic novel’s name is the movie The Light at the Edge of the World. Its a 1971 action & adventure film adapted from Jules Verne‘s classic adventure novel Le Phare du bout du monde, when pirates take over a lighthouse on a rocky island in the South Atlantic during the mid-19th century, but the iron-willed light-keeper played by Kirk Douglas fights their plot
A Place to hang Your Cape: What is the biggest challenge you’ve had to face while creating this project?
Piacsek: To write an intriguing plot that would feel real and simultaneously fantastic to the reader. I’ve strived to create a cohesive narrative intertwined with historical events such as the California Gold Rush and the discovery of the Northwest Passage sea route, also linked with the settings of Victorian London and the Arctic world. To inject detail into my work, I did a lot of web research and used several books, looking for countless images and information. I love highly detailed comics.
A Place to hang Your Cape: I’ve noticed that you’re already finished writing the sequel. Is that going to be the end of the project, or would you like to expand it further? Any chance of spin-offs, prequels, or additional sequels?
Piacsek: No, this is not the end! The Lost Adventures of Baron Buckman series crosses space and time, and I will keep expanding and exploring the Baron Buckman’s universe, introducing at every new episode new characters, themes and exploits. The sequel of The Light at the Top of the World will take part mainly in India, but also in Okinawa/Japan, Indochina, and London, and will bring the new line-up of Jon Strider and the Trackers. This second volume is filled with martial arts combat, desert races, endless journeys across vanished temples, and encounters with supernatural beings and ancient Gods.
THE TEAM
Its just me! The story, penciling, inking, colouring, lettering , graphic design, and the cover art... Its my way of working, to be in control throughout the entire process. It took me many years to fully develop my drawing technique and I want the graphic novel to be in accordance with my artistic style. My work is very original in the sense that all artwork is made with brush & Indian Ink, including the balloons - I only use the computer for colouring and lettering. This is why it will take me around 6 months to finish the 56 pages of the book. But if I surpass my funding goal I will be able to hire a colourist I can trust.
PAGES PREVIEW
You will find below the first finished pages and 2 additional pencil pages of the prologue. More pages will follow as updates through the life of this project, for the benefit of my project's supporters.




(pencil pages) The prologue of the graphic novel takes place in the mythical India, introducing a special character: Captain Burton, a globe-trotting fortune hunter with a keen interest in the hidden secrets of lost cities and ancient Gods. Like the opening sequence of an adventure movie, here Captain Burton explores the legendary Temple of Naga in India, in search of the Book of Tattva:

<p>To call Six-Gun Gorilla obscure is an understatement. The only
reason anyone even knows of the character is thanks to a 1948 book about
British Pulp literature called <i>Boys Will Be Boys</i>. Scholars and other
interested parties couldn’t help but be captivated by the author’s description
of that story and so it took on a mythic, Holy Grail status the way lost films
like London After Midnight often do. Jess Nevins, an authority on this subject,
recently got a chance to scan the story and has posted it on-line as a <a href=""http://jessnevins.com/sixgungorilla/tableofcontents.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">free download</a>,
bless his heart. Check it out - it's a fun read!<br/></p>
<p>The character first came to my attention sometime in 2011, when I was
 perusing a website on Golden Age and Pulp superheroes (i.e. Doc Savage,
 The Shadow, The Spider). As a kid I was absolutely obsessed with great 
apes and was a huge fan of the original <b><i>King Kong</i></b> and <b><i>Mighty Joe Young</i></b>.
 I’m also a huge Western fan so the concept clicked with me instantly. I
 looked for the story and discovered, much to my chagrin, that not only 
was it out of print, it had <b>never </b>been reprinted and that the only two know copies in existence were under lock and key in a British museum!</p>
<p>But I just couldn’t get that title out of my head. That afternoon I drove to my local shopping mall (listening to the <b><i>Hawk the Slayer</i></b>
 soundtrack of all things) and the story basically wrote itself. By the 
time I pulled into the parking lot I had the entire yarn, beginning to 
end. As a writer it's rare that stories emerge fully formed like that, 
but this was one of those times. If there was no <b><i>Six-Gun Gorilla</i></b> for me to read, dag nabbit, I was gonna have to write the dang thing myself!</p>
<div>
<p>
</p>
<p>I approach the story as <i><b>Tarzan</b></i> 
flipped on its head: instead of a human raised by apes in the jungle 
you’ve got an ape raised by humans in the Old West. Tone-wise, think of 
the original <i><b>Robocop</b></i>. <i><b>Six-Gun Gorilla: Long Days of Vengeance</b></i>
 has outrageous moments aplenty – you’d hope so, given the outrageous 
premise – but I've always felt this sort of thing is way more fun when it's played straight.<br/></p>

<p>Despite the <b>uber/ultra/mega</b>-obscure
 nature of the story, I wasn't the only to get bitten by the gunslinging gorilla bug. Just as 
the finishing touches were being put on the first issue I got an e-mail linking to article about an upcoming comic from BOOM! Studios, a Science Fiction saga titled... <i><b>Six-Gun Gorilla</b></i>.</p>
<p>Now, mind you, I embarked on this journey knowing full well that the story was going into the public domain in 2013, but what were the odds of someone else doing a comic based on that long lost Pulp story? Slim and none. <br/></p>
<p>Slim won the day.<br/></p>
<p>And when did I get

<p> It’s

Both of us 
were fired up by that title and concept largely, I’m guessing, because 
the actual story wasn’t available to read, so our imaginations filled in

<p>Luckily, our stories couldn’t be more different. For starters they’re in two totally different genres.

Howdy
 pardners! The Wild West just got a whole lot wilder! Hang onto your 
britches, 'cause you're in for one bumpy ride, with more gun-fights,
 saloon brawls, thrilling chases and bloody vendettas than you can shake a banana at!

Six-Gun Gorilla: Long Days of Vengeance 
is the rip-snortin’, bone-crushing, brain-blasting story of a 
pistol-packing Gorilla and his bloody quest to hunt down and destroy the
 gang of cut-throats who murdered the man who raised him like a father. 



East Congo, 1849:  While on Safari in Africa, an English 
big-game hunter slaughters an entire troop of gorillas. While butchering
 the animals for trophies, his bush guides discover a survivor among the
 carnage: an infant gorilla, still clinging to his mother's breast. The 
orphan is placed aboard a boat to Europe where he captures the attention
 of two passengers: an Irish circus owner named Professor Malloy and his young 
daughter, Abigail. 



Malloy wins the baby gorilla in a card game and brings him to 
America, where grows up as a member of the circus family. They name him 
""Kumba"", an African word for ""roar"".



America, 1865: Taught to use giant, hand-crafted pistols as part of a sharpshooting act, Kumba has become a frontier sensation. 




Although he loves his adopted father, Kumba's closest relationship is
 with his “big sister”, Abigail, who has become an accomplished trick 
horse rider. The unlikely siblings communicate through sign language, 
making Abigail the only one who can truly understand him. As the Civil 
War rages in the East, the circus tours the American Southwest staying 
as far away from the conflict as possible. But the war is about to come 
to them.

Enter mysterious stranger Giuliano Schmidt, a European immigrant on 
the run from a gang of ruthless outlaws led by Gravesend, the most sadistic killer West of the Pecos. Wounded while escaping from the gang, Giuliano stows away in the circus caravan, where he is discovered by Abigail, who nurses the 
stranger back to health.

Understanding that he's put his saviors in tremendous peril, Giuliano 
slips away at the first opportunity. But it’s too late: Gravesend and 
his gang have followed his trail to the circus and exact a terrible price on the family for meddling in 
their affairs. Driven half-mad with grief and rage, Kumba takes up his guns and sets
 out  on the vengeance trail, a trail that will lead him to an even greater evil. The strangest, most 
startling Western hero of them all has been born!

book? That's because I like to pay the freelancers who work for me and, 
guess what? They like to get paid for their work! Ain't that somethin'?
 Here's a quick breakdown:
$3,000 for the art + $300 for the lettering = $3,300 smackeroos.
And then IndieGoGo takes their (perfectly reasonable) 5% cut, amounting to $150.
Add in printing costs: 50 issues = $132.00.
I always sucked at math, but I believe that adds up to $3,432.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi im tristian and this is my first book, you might remember me from my school essays that my brother kept putting on his blog, then they got writren about by Andrew bolt and then they put them on the Lifted brow site and finaly the guys at Daily review said ""omg pls tristian we love your commentry and editorial voice come write for us"" and I had a column at Daily Review!</p>
<p>This is realy important to me because its my first book and i want to have a career as a blowhard political comentator. You have to have a book to do that, or at least a show on sky news that nobody watches.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My bro says we need $1100 for the print run and postage, I told him ""no prob I have lots of fans and they will preorder it"", he just looked at me and went uhhhhhhh ok I'll put a crowdfund up for you but after that please leave me alone cos he's got a wife and a child now and then he mutered something about pagination and I went to play destiny.</p>
<p>Indiegogo says I should tell you about our <strong>amazing perks</strong> but i don't have any, except if you want gold emboss on the book that's $3000. The book will have a spine and fit well on your shelf with other books.</p>
<p>If we dont reach the goal of $1100 thats cool, my bro will not print as many books and also I lose the bet and he said I have to babysit rachel EVERY sunday until after valentines day</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This book will be the most impacting one there is.</p>
<p>Aparently its not ok to promise things like that, instead let me say that my story of america is a bit different than other ones I read, its about what its like to be in the middle of a presidential campaign,, eating popcorn with ted cruz people, drinking cantelope juice with hilary clinton supporters, seeing donald trump in a horse dancing stadium, meeting intresting people and letting them drive me home and give me christian pamphlets.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Because you value my transparency let me reasure you that my publisher is very good at making books and also sending them to people. The printer knows how to put my words and drawings on paper and do the thing that makes them stuck together but not so stuck together that you can't open the book.</p>
<p>Theres many risks and challenges in the creation of this book but hitchhiking in las vegas without getting killed was the main one and that went ok.*</p>
<p>* please nobody tell my gran I did this</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people are quite cheap and maybe dont want to buy this book even after I explained how good it is, thats ok! its totally ok, maybe you don't have anyone you want to buy a christmas present for.</p>
<p>If you dont want a book but still think im good you should tell everyone you know about the book so maybe they'll buy one.</p>

<h3>WHAT</h3>
<p>Dendrolagus is a Swedish micro publisher of comics with focus on experimentation with storytelling. Comics that really takes advantage of the medium itself. Dendrolagus is also an anthology of said comics, now presenting it's second issue, filled with powerful, inspiring and contemplative storytelling by 8 different artists sharing 64 pages between them.</p>
<h3>WHY</h3>
<p>I love going to comics festivals and especially zine heavy ones. That's where you can discover the amazing and fringy weird stuff that artists put out themselves, their passion projects. The stuff we make when we aren't creating to make a living. Art for art's sake. And that's one reason I decided to publish Dendrolagus in English, to share these great comics with the world. These are comics that deserve to not be limited to only the tiny crowd of Swedish speaking comics fans.</p>
<h3>WHO</h3>
<p>I'm Steve Nyberg. A Comic artist turned publisher/editor of Dendrolagus. I've been self publishing zines and mini comics in different forms for years (apart from being published by other publishers as well) and last year I turned Dendrolagus into a micro publisher. The idea is to promote alternative comics that experiment with the storytelling itself. To create an outlet for these comics to be read by as many people as possible. And I've got some amazing comics from these artists:</p>

<p>Dendrolagus' main focus is on Swedish/Nordic artists, however in this issue I've also included a comic by Japanese artist Yuka Masuko who's living and working in Germany and says her comic is partially inspired by a trip through Sweden. The other featured artists are either Swedish, Sweden based or from our friendly neighbour Denmark.</p>
<h3>WHEN</h3>
<p>Dendrolagus #2 will be released and shipped to all backers in the first week of May. The aim is to have it released during Stockholm's International Comics Festival (SIS) the 5th of May and of course I'll send it out to all backers before that.</p>
<h3>HOW</h3>
<p>This campaign is to cover the printing of the anthology. Quality offset printing is good looking but it's not cheap. The artists' pay is in a separate budget and if we reach our goal to cover the printing cost we can sweeten the artists' pay with whatever funds exceeds the goal.</p>
<p>All the comics are finished. They just need to be sent to the printer. The funding is already secured too so there's really no risk for you when backing the project. Dendrolagus #2 will be made, and will be made on time. It's already booked to appear at the international comics festivals of both Stockholm and Toronto in early May. And since I've done this before - both the anthology and the crowdfunding - I'm confident in my promise of delivering Dendrolagus #2 to you all. And I can guarantee that it's going to be at least as amazing as the last one.<br/> <br/>However, I'm funding it out of my own pockets so the crowdfunding is to help out with these expenses, making it less of a risk for my private finances and making sure I can keep this anthology going with even more issues to come.</p>
<p>So please pre order your copy of Dendrolagus #2 by donating to the campaign or help out just by sharing the campaign with others. Tell your friends!</p>

<p>   Now, I'm creating the first 100* page graphic novel in the series. Based on the story originally written by <strong>Cheyenne Martin</strong>. We dive deep in to the origins of Aerah, and all the events that led to him becoming immortal. The story (and humor) are inspired from comics like <i><strong>Thrud the Barbarian</strong></i>, and <i><strong>Saga</strong></i>. </p>

Thank you in advance!</p><p><strong>What makes me so certain about all this?</strong></p><p>Let me share a personal story of a girl I worked with.</p><p>Kate and I met at our very first SOLE Girls summer camp in 2013. At the end of camp, we give each girl a certificate that recognizes something the leaders thought she was really great at, in her case, it was ""Being a Leader"". We present the certificate during a ceremony, and it is a really special opportunity for each girl to shine. When Kate received her certificate, she accepted it and slowly ripped it up while the other girls received theirs. At this point, Kate was not able to accept a compliment. So while we thought she was an incredible leader and helpful to others, she had a million reasons why she wasn’t and was not able to see herself from our perspective. My heart sunk, I hadn’t changed her life in two days (I clearly needed a reality check). However, we managed to convince her to accept a new certificate that we would take to her house especially for her.</p><p>After that first summer camp, Kate joined our nine-week program. This time she had all the answers, lots to say, and seemed very confident. But, as soon as it came time to do something that she didn’t feel she was the best at, like running, she was the first one to count herself out. She had a long list of negative things that she believed about herself. One day, while on a run, I decided to ask her (after a few weeks of recognizing her pattern),“Do you think that is true Kate? Do you think it’s true that you are not as great as the other girls because of the reasons you mentioned?”</p><p>Kate: “Yes.”</p><p>Ashley: “Ok – let’s try something. Repeat after me, “I’m strong, I’m powerful, I’m Kate.”</p><p>Kate: “Why would I say that, what’s the point? I’m not very strong, or powerful, I'm just a girl. There are people changing the world, they are powerful.”</p><p>Ashley: “Just try.”</p><p>Kate (in a whisper and so fast that it was almost indistinguishable): “I’m strong. I’m powerful. I’m Kate. There I did it, that didn’t do anything.”</p><p>Ashley: “Cool, yes you are. Try again.”</p><p>Kate: “I’m strong, I’m powerful, I’m Kate.”</p><p>Then all of a sudden she stopped running and broke into tears.</p><p>Ashley: Oh shoot! What did I do now?</p><p>Others started to pass us and when we finally got going again, we continued to the end of the run in silence. At the end of the session, she stayed behind after everyone else had left.  She gave me a hug and whispered in my ear, “I’m strong, I’m powerful, I’m Kate.” Each week after that she repeated it, slowly and very quietly at first, but each week she became a little bit more confident. When it came to the last week, we used our training to complete a five-kilometre run, and her anxiety was running high. In the end, Kate burst through that Finish Line with her hands up in the air and yelling, “I’m strong, I’m powerful, I’m KATE!”</p><p>Now, Kate is a role model for other girls, she mentors younger girls! She is a leader, and while she still has anxiety, the more she connects inside to the possibility of awesomeness, the easier it is for her to manage.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549233454/qwivibyte1wodndvzzbd.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Why Crowdfunding?

She wanted to help as many girls as possible navigate their paths, to include positive mental health, living healthy active lives, staying in sports and finding mentors and role models.   Before she knew it Sole Girls had a waitlist and Ashley knew she wasn’t alone.  Other people, parents, teachers, principals, girls knew something was missing in our communities too.</p><p> Ashley believes that lifelong happiness and well-being must be built on a foundation of self-love, support, and health and that this is possible for everyone.

The five key lessons described in ""A Girl's Guide to Finding Her Happy Pace"" provide valuable takeaways that can be implemented into daily life. I can see this book being used in various youth movement and mental health programs around the world."" -Meghan Burrows, Recreation Therapist and Performance Coach.</p><p>“ The whole idea of a Happy Pace blew my mind. Getting to learn from Sole Girls has been the greatest honour of my life.  Sole Girls taught me how to listen to myself and others in a way that I never had before. Ashley taught me how to live my life from a place that is authentically me, using my values. She taught me how to change the negative voices in my head to voices that empower me. She taught me what real love, support, and community look and feel like. By being a role model for me, she taught me how to be a role model for girls.  Every girl needs Sole Girls, and this book!”  - Annika Macfarlane, Teen soleteer and now Sole Girls Coach</p><p>“After my first session of soleteering (mentoring) for Sole Girls, I was hooked. Sole Girls and mentorship helped me pull my life together as a teen, and create goals. I started going for runs if I felt stressed out. Ashley came into my life when I needed her most, she brought Sole Girls to me and it saved me. Now, I don’t believe in saying, “I can’t” because I know there is always some way.” Maddie - teen soleteer and now 4th year university student UBCO</p><p>“I met Ashley when she began her journey with Sole Girls. {My daughter, Amanda Todd, had left us only months before}. Her experiences, she realized, were the same as many others and knew she was not alone in this world.  Girls will benefit from Ashley’s passion and experience. This book will be a wonderful tool to allow girls to gain insight into their own self-worth and be the best person they can endeavour to be.” -Carol Todd mother of Amanda Todd and  advocate against cyberbullying<br/><br/>"" As a Mom of a tween in her second year of middle school this book really resonates with me! We all know how important communication is with any relationship and A Girl's Guide To Finding Her Happy Place demonstrates a healthy, open dialogue between mentor and young lady! It also presents a great opportunity and catalyst for parent/child conversation on topics that otherwise might remain silent. I am looking forward to introducing it to my daughter!""<br/>-Vanessa Jensen, Ironman athlete, and mom <br/><br/>""As a teacher of tween and teen girls I have seen the same patterns over and over that existed when I was their age and have only increased with the use of social media. This book helps girls to understand that they are not alone in navigating the girl world and that there are so, so many strategies to help you find your inner awesome! I would make this mandatory reading for all girls in my classes.""<br/>-Veronica May, Teacher Langley BC<br/><br/>""A Girl’s Guide to Finding Her Happy Pace tackles the messy highs and lows of today’s Girl World, including bullying, social media, rejection, friendship, mentorship, and understanding values. This book brings to life the power that simple practices, like relationship-building and conversation, can have on helping girls discover and live within their confident, true selves. The Guide also makes mental health an approachable topic, modeling healthy ways to engage girls in navigating real teenage challenges. As a teacher, I recommend this book for tweens and teens and the people who love and support them: parents, teachers, mentors, school counselors, youth group leaders, and beyond!"" <br/>Sara Russell, Teacher and Master Coach</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1547217602/crhufjn7uz29qxvlba6x.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>BONUS: A personal message from Coach Ashley, ""Do you want to find your happy pace?""</strong></p><p>Did you know that Girls drop out of sport 6x the rate of boys, and they don't drop out for lack of skill. Girls drop out because of these 4 reasons.</p><p>1. Financial Reasons 2. Social Belonging  3. Health Issues 4. Lack of ROLE MODELS!!!!</p><p>I’ll never forget entering high school.  Everyone standing in their little groups and I knew no one.  It was terrifying. Trying out for a team… terrifying. Not making the team… mortifying.  Where did I go to talk about this embarrassment? I was lucky that I was part of another team outside of school and also that I had at least 1 role model/mentor in my life, otherwise I surely would have dropped out of sport. </p><p><strong>Why are sport and role models and mentorship so important for girls?</strong></p><p><strong>Why Sports?</strong></p><p>Youth who get extra physical activity in school do better in reading and math and have an increased ability to absorb knowledge and to learn things,</p><p>It helps with behavioral issues in the classroom.</p><p>Solves a lot of interpersonal issues because they have an opportunity to get that energy out.</p><p>Exercise increases the concentration of both dopamine and norepinephrine, as well as other brain chemicals. a dose of exercise is like taking a bit of Ritalin or Adderall, it’s similar to taking a stimulant.</p><p>Even a little bit more movement makes us happier (yay mental health)</p><p><strong>Why Role models and mentors?</strong></p><p>Mentors give advice and help brainstorm - they act as a confidant that you can unload your problems with. They’ll listen, help you dissect exactly what’s bothering you, and provide support as you think of solutions together.</p><p>Mentorship is all about forming a great relationship centered around a mutual passion. While there are plenty of similarities to friendship, it is much more than that.</p><p>They may be the person who relentlessly boosts your self-esteem and confidence until you feel brave enough to stop over your own boundaries, or the person providing the knowledge you need to grow.</p><p>Some more staggering stats: </p><p>45% of teens say they are online almost constantly, but over 25% of girls in grades 7-12 say they have been the victims of cyber bullying. </p><h3>Navigating the Girl World</h3><p>Like all girls, I have lived through the girl world, the friendships, the body image struggles, the anxiety, being cut from the team, the trends, the drama, the expectations and all the feels. I had always thought that when I was an adult, I’d finally get to make the rules, run the show… but it turns out there were just more rules: different game, same story.  </p><p>Maybe you can relate. Your girl world might be slightly different but however you grew up, you did grow up and had to learn to navigate the lessons somehow.  Sometimes the hard way.</p><h3>Why create the Girl’s Guide to Finding her Happy Pace?</h3><p>My goal in writing this guide is to create an easily digestible and relatable tool for girls to help navigate tween and teenhood and maybe even beyond. I want it to be so easy to read that girls keep coming back to it as they learn the lessons in their own lives and relate it back to the story. We all learn life lessons, but wouldn’t it be nice to know some of the core lessons in advance? This book will create a space and a community for girls to understand themselves, which really benefits those around her. We all know a girl in our life who matters, whether it was a mother or a daughter or a sister or a friend.  It’s time to give that girl a very simple tool that she can use for the rest of her life and share with others.</p><p>So, welcome to a new kind of self-help book. It’s not a long-winded novel about what not to do and how to be better.  It’s a comic book, for girls, one that all girls deserve to read and have access to. Half the population.</p><p>Getting a grip on the Girl World is particularly important now because of the rising numbers of girls’ suicide, declining participation rates in sport, and staggering self-worth statistics.  </p><p>But there is a reason for hope. On the other end of the spectrum, there are women who want to be role models, who have overcome the challenges, the haters, the reasons to drop out and they want to share. Put simply, linking tools and mentorship to girls, and keeping girls in sport is a powerful combination that can change—and possibly save— lives.</p><p>Being a girl doesn’t have to include all the drama and stress. There are ways, as you’ll see throughout this book, to be the most awesome person you know.  Finding your happy pace is really about learning, and realizing who you are and who you want to be.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/EHbhKQ5YUHA?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><h3>So what about today?</h3><p>Today, I am honored to have built a strong community at Sole Girls of Women who can be vulnerable with each other, who have become lifelong friends because of Sole Girls and who strive to live their best lives being the role models that girls need. I am still learning too. In my professional life, I’ve evolved from a life coach to the founder of the an award winning social enterprise that has affected thousands of girls, to an international speaker, author and Happy Pace Seeker. I’m honored to have the ability to help people every single day, now that’s SOLE awesome!</p><p>Beyond my Sole family and career, one of the most important aspects of my well-being is my mental health. I continually strive to understand my ego, challenge my beliefs and learn as well as apply the hard lessons that help me grow.  And at the end of each day, I ask myself: “What did you love today and what did you learn today?”</p><p>I know we are all capable of finding our Happy Pace. That is, while I believe that we can all find it at our own pace, we don’t have to do it by ourselves. Now that you’ve found this book, you have found your community—your sole sisters. No matter what, you are not alone.

We all know how important communication is with any relationship and A Girl's Guide To Finding Her Happy Place demonstrates a healthy, open dialogue between mentor and young lady! It also presents a great opportunity and catalyst for parent/child conversation on topics that otherwise might remain silent. I am looking forward to introducing it to my daughter!""-Vanessa Jensen, Ironman athlete, and mom ""As a teacher of tween and teen girls I have seen the same patterns over and over that existed when I was their age and have only increased with the use of social media. This book helps girls to understand that they are not alone in navigating the girl world and that there are so, so many strategies to help you find your inner awesome! I would make this mandatory reading for all girls in my classes.""-Veronica May, Teacher Langley BC""A Girl’s Guide to Finding Her Happy Pace tackles the messy highs and lows of today’s Girl World, including bullying, social media, rejection, friendship, mentorship, and understanding values. This book brings to life the power that simple practices, like relationship-building and conversation, can have on helping girls discover and live within their confident, true selves. The Guide also makes mental health an approachable topic, modeling healthy ways to engage girls in navigating real teenage challenges. As a teacher, I recommend this book for tweens and teens and the people who love and support them: parents, teachers, mentors, school counselors, youth group leaders, and beyond!"" Sara Russell, Teacher and Master CoachBONUS: A personal message from Coach Ashley, ""Do you want to find your happy pace?""Did you know that Girls drop out of sport 6x the rate of boys, and they don't drop out for lack of skill. Girls drop out because of these 4 reasons.1. Financial Reasons 2. Social Belonging  3. Health Issues 4. Lack of ROLE MODELS!!!!I’ll never forget entering high school.  Everyone standing in their little groups and I knew no one.  It was terrifying. Trying out for a team… terrifying. Not making the team… mortifying.  Where did I go to talk about this embarrassment? I was lucky that I was part of another team outside of school and also that I had at least 1 role model/mentor in my life, otherwise I surely would have dropped out of sport. Why are sport and role models and mentorship so important for girls?Why Sports?Youth who get extra physical activity in school do better in reading and math and have an increased ability to absorb knowledge and to learn things,It helps with behavioral issues in the classroom.Solves a lot of interpersonal issues because they have an opportunity to get that energy out.Exercise increases the concentration of both dopamine and norepinephrine, as well as other brain chemicals. a dose of exercise is like taking a bit of Ritalin or Adderall, it’s similar to taking a stimulant.Even a little bit more movement makes us happier (yay mental health)Why Role models and mentors?Mentors give advice and help brainstorm - they act as a confidant that you can unload your problems with. They’ll listen, help you dissect exactly what’s bothering you, and provide support as you think of solutions together.Mentorship is all about forming a great relationship centered around a mutual passion. While there are plenty of similarities to friendship, it is much more than that.They may be the person who relentlessly boosts your self-esteem and confidence until you feel brave enough to stop over your own boundaries, or the person providing the knowledge you need to grow.Some more staggering stats: 45% of teens say they are online almost constantly, but over 25% of girls in grades 7-12 say they have been the victims of cyber bullying. Navigating the Girl WorldLike all girls, I have lived through the girl world, the friendships, the body image struggles, the anxiety, being cut from the team, the trends, the drama, the expectations and all the feels. I had always thought that when I was an adult, I’d finally get to make the rules, run the show… but it turns out there were just more rules: different game, same story.  Maybe you can relate. Your girl world might be slightly different but however you grew up, you did grow up and had to learn to navigate the lessons somehow.  Sometimes the hard way.Why create the Girl’s Guide to Finding her Happy Pace?My goal in writing this guide is to create an easily digestible and relatable tool for girls to help navigate tween and teenhood and maybe even beyond. I want it to be so easy to read that girls keep coming back to it as they learn the lessons in their own lives and relate it back to the story. We all learn life lessons, but wouldn’t it be nice to know some of the core lessons in advance? This book will create a space and a community for girls to understand themselves, which really benefits those around her. We all know a girl in our life who matters, whether it was a mother or a daughter or a sister or a friend.  It’s time to give that girl a very simple tool that she can use for the rest of her life and share with others.So, welcome to a new kind of self-help book. It’s not a long-winded novel about what not to do and how to be better.  It’s a comic book, for girls, one that all girls deserve to read and have access to. Half the population.Getting a grip on the Girl World is particularly important now because of the rising numbers of girls’ suicide, declining participation rates in sport, and staggering self-worth statistics.  But there is a reason for hope. On the other end of the spectrum, there are women who want to be role models, who have overcome the challenges, the haters, the reasons to drop out and they want to share. Put simply, linking tools and mentorship to girls, and keeping girls in sport is a powerful combination that can change—and possibly save— lives.Being a girl doesn’t have to include all the drama and stress. There are ways, as you’ll see throughout this book, to be the most awesome person you know.  Finding your happy pace is really about learning, and realizing who you are and who you want to be.So what about today?Today, I am honored to have built a strong community at Sole Girls of Women who can be vulnerable with each other, who have become lifelong friends because of Sole Girls and who strive to live their best lives being the role models that girls need. I am still learning too. In my professional life, I’ve evolved from a life coach to the founder of the an award winning social enterprise that has affected thousands of girls, to an international speaker, author and Happy Pace Seeker. I’m honored to have the ability to help people every single day, now that’s SOLE awesome!Beyond my Sole family and career, one of the most important aspects of my well-being is my mental health. I continually strive to understand my ego, challenge my beliefs and learn as well as apply the hard lessons that help me grow.  And at the end of each day, I ask myself: “What did you love today and what did you learn today?”I know we are all capable of finding our Happy Pace. That is, while I believe that we can all find it at our own pace, we don’t have to do it by ourselves. Now that you’ve found this book, you have found your community—your sole sisters. No matter what, you are not alone. We are here to encourage and support each other to be the happiest, healthiest versions of ourselves.So, hands up if you’re ready to find your Happy Pace? Click on over to the best perk for you!PS - a huge thank you to all those that have supported me and Sole Girls on this journey. It's been quite the ride and it's only just beginning!",7.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Detroit</strong> -- Orphaned by the brutal killing of her family, Detroit is our main narrator and protagonist. (Her name has specific meaning and will be revealed in the book.) Not easily accepted into the new herd at the orphanage, she soon befriends another broken soul,  Sgt. Elias Delgado, and together they'll learn to overcome their personal trauma.  </p>

<p><strong>Roi</strong> -- Playful jokester with a reputation for always finding a way to steal food.  </p>

<p><strong>EcoGuards</strong> -- Led by locals Joseph and Rafi, they are members of a conservationist group who risk their lives by protecting and leading the elephants to safety.</p>

<p>Below is a preview of the first ten pages of Tuskers. </p>
<p><strong>ARTWORK</strong> is traditionally hand painted with watercolor and ink.  </p>
<p><strong>LETTERING</strong> is temporary and will be replaced in the final printing.  </p>
<p>Please be aware that the artwork depicts scenes of graphic violence to elephants -- Tuskers is a work of fiction, however the catalyst of the story is unfortunately all too real. We've spent several years researching the African poaching crisis and felt it was best to show the realistic carnage that is inflicted on elephants to harvest their ivory. </p>

<p>Self-publishing a graphic novel is an expensive proposition. </p>
<p><u><strong>Production</strong></u>: With around 130 pages to be illustrated and then lettered, there’s a lot of dedicated work that needs to be done.</p>
<p><u><strong>Printing</strong></u>: We have quotes from different printers and while we want to make this as affordable as possible, we also want to make sure it's a quality bookshelf book.  70pt pages, a beautiful heavy-weight embossed cover so the logo resembles elephant tusks, and end pages that will hold up to water-media for personalized remarques (sketches).</p>

</div></div>","UPDATED ART FROM THE COMPLETED BOOK! 
 


 


 
 

 
Tuskers is a passion project about the devastating affects poaching has on the African elephant population and the true-life superheroes who choose to protect them. 
Through this thrilling adventure story you will learn that elephants are so much more than the sum of their parts.
 

 

ELEPHANTS 
(Our main elephants are orphans that find one another after their families are poached for ivory.)

 
Detroit -- Orphaned by the brutal killing of her family, Detroit is our main narrator and protagonist. (Her name has specific meaning and will be revealed in the book.) Not easily accepted into the new herd at the orphanage, she soon befriends another broken soul,  Sgt. Elias Delgado, and together they'll learn to overcome their personal trauma.  
Esampu --  Future matriarch in training, Esampu loves being around people and other members of the herd. 
Roi -- Playful jokester with a reputation for always finding a way to steal food.  
Daphne -- Matriarch of the orphanage herd. She grew up in Zuri's camp after a brutal leg snare left her for dead.  
 
HUMANS

 
Dr. Zuri Erivo -- The caretaker of the elephant orphanage who has spent her life protecting wildlife in her homeland of South Sudan.
Sgt. Elias Delgado -- A disgraced Army Ranger who is seeking redemption after the brutal ambush of his troops in Afghanistan.
EcoGuards -- Led by locals Joseph and Rafi, they are members of a conservationist group who risk their lives by protecting and leading the elephants to safety.
Abdalla Katumba -- A vicious war-lord who wants to sell the elephant’s ivory tusks to pay for weapons and power. He leads his own private army that views the elephants as commodities to be bought and killed for profit.  
 

Below is a preview of the first ten pages of Tuskers. 
ARTWORK is traditionally hand painted with watercolor and ink.  
LETTERING is temporary and will be replaced in the final printing.  
Please be aware that the artwork depicts scenes of graphic violence to elephants -- Tuskers is a work of fiction, however the catalyst of the story is unfortunately all too real. We've spent several years researching the African poaching crisis and felt it was best to show the realistic carnage that is inflicted on elephants to harvest their ivory. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
BELOW IS A PREVIEW OF SOME STILL IN-PRODUCTION ART -
 

 

 

We have assembled a fantastic creative team to bring Tuskers to life. 
WRITER MARC GAFFEN: From The Bernie Mac Show to Grimm and now New Amsterdam, Marc has been a camera assistant, writer, associate producer, and script coordinator on numerous television shows. He was also the co-writer on the successful Grimm comic book series (based on the NBC television show).    
WRITER JAVIER BARRIOS: Besides being an amazing father to twin girls, Javier is the manager of the television and film script library at the prestigious Writer's Guild of America. He is also a screenwriter that specializes in stories with a social and environmental message. 
ARTIST DANIEL GOVAR: Daniel is a comic, children’s book, and gaming illustrator who has worked on dozens of titles for various publishers over 10 years; Marvel, DC, Valiant, Dynamite, and has self-published a number of projects here on Kickstarter such as Lovecraft and Mr. Trunk Builds a Wall. Over his career he has tackled horror, fantasy, sci-fi, true-crime/noir, and real-world dramas. Daniel is a regular at 10-15 conventions throughout the country and lives in St. Petersburg with his fiancée, son, and 2 Great Danes that keep him on his toes.
EDITOR GREG TUMBARELLO: Greg is a senior editor with over fifteen years professional experience working with numerous companies, including Legendary Entertainment where he helped cofound and structure their successful comic book division with acclaimed editor Bob Schreck. He has previously worked as an editor, writer, and producer for MTV Networks, Lion Forge Comics, Image Comics, The Comic Book Legal Defense Fund, and Tokyopop.
 

Self-publishing a graphic novel is an expensive proposition. 
Production: With around 130 pages to be illustrated and then lettered, there’s a lot of dedicated work that needs to be done.
Printing: We have quotes from different printers and while we want to make this as affordable as possible, we also want to make sure it's a quality bookshelf book.  70pt pages, a beautiful heavy-weight embossed cover so the logo resembles elephant tusks, and end pages that will hold up to water-media for personalized remarques (sketches).
 

 

 

Our current schedule is as follows --
April - August 2019 -- continue illustrating pages based on the finished script.
September - October 2019 -- send completed book to printers for publishing.
Early November 2019 -- send out digital edition to backers.
End of November - December 2019 -- send out print edition to backers.
 

We can't express just how much your support means to us. It's a true honor to have your backing. We won’t let you down.

When he finds he has abilities he is forced into becoming a hero. However for every success he has he also fails. These failures result in him doubting himself and whether or not being a ""hero"" means losing who you are or becoming something you are not.The first issue opens with our hero a month into his journey to becoming a so called ""hero"". Here we find a he has been involved in a building that has exploded. He fails to save a woman trapped in the debris and is distraught with his failure. The police arrive and mistake him for being behind the explosion and deaths of innocent civilians. With his judgement now clouded and emotions running high, we follow him on a chase for his life mentally and phyically  from a corrupt police force who have no problem with killing him rather than arresting him. Like any project there are a couple of challenges I may face.
The first is being able to get a new issue out every month. This being due to being in a full time job. The way around this is when the comic starts to pick up and I can sustain myself off it. Which will enable me to reducing my hours to totally focus on hitting the once a month deadline.
Another way around this is to bring in other people to share the work load, such as a writer or inker.If i don't meet the full funding i will be scaling back how many issues are coloured straight away. This wont affect any perks.


If you want to help with my dream please sponsor and spread the word on facebook/twitter or instagram.
Thank you everyone let's bring my dream to life.

We want to ensure that our illustrator, Hatem, can focus on the project full-time. If he's required to take on other work, and that means Asra may not be finished for several years. This is a 500-page graphic novel we're talking about, after all!
Fine, you've convinced me. If I give you the money, how will you spend it?
Every donation to our campaign will go directly to fund Hatem so he can spend significantly more time drawing Asra. Without additional funds, Asra Volume 1 may not be finished until 2019. Can you bear to wait the long? We can't!A successful crowdfunding campaign will help Hatem finish Volume 1 by 2017 and Volume 2 by 2018! That's a huge difference, and it means you get to meet Asra sooner!If we exceed our goal, Hatem is going to devote even more time to the project and Asra will be on shelves before you can say Yalla!Have I mentioned I love perks?We are so excited to bring you perks that we think are pretty darn cool. However, we are also keeping our perks really manageable so we don't over-promise and under-deliver. We hate that. Our goal is to get every single perk to you by the time Volume 1 is published.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Empire City has had a long history of heroes and villains taking part in a war that was fought for many years. However in recent times the city has slept a bit easier at night.

The mob have been slowly working their way through the cracks left in the old city and have made their foothold.

<div>Hey guys! Thanks so, so very much for your first week of donations - just great!</div>
<div>I've gotten some feedback and I've added a $15 and up perk of some mini-comics featuring stuff that I think is fun and cool but can't quite get to work in the main story. Any donation that I've already received that's over $15 will get 'em, too!</div>
<div>There's still several weeks left to go, so let's get the word out and donate and share!</div>
<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>I was sexually assaulted by my closest friend when I was 19 years old. After a botched suicide attempt, I wound up in a mental hospital. Two weeks later, I was back out into the world, finding that all my previous assumptions about my family, my friends, and my faith, were in question.</p>
<p>Along the way, I learned to become who I am. Part of that involved being in the desert, while on acid, believing I was on Mars.</p>
<p>I WANT TO BE WELL is a humorous, cartoonish, and honest look into how I managed to scrape by even during the most dire circumstances, and find hope and friendship along the way.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Your support will help ensure that this project will be completed. The finished book will likely run about 200 pages, which is a *ton* of work, but the funding from all of you through Indiegogo will make sure that I have the necessary support, tools, and resources to see it through.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you pledge $40, I'll ship you a printed copy of the book! For $50, you'll get a SIGNED copy! And for $100 or more, you'll get the book, signed, WITH a cover illustration featuring your celebrity of choice kissing your Final Fantasy character of choice! Or whatever else you want, I guess.</p>
<p>That is, of course, on top of everyone who pledges $5 or more, who'll receive a PDF download of the book upon completion!</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>My experience is not one that's often talked about all that much in polite society, really - men who've been victims of sexual assault are often stigmatized, even now. But I've met and spoken to enough men my age and older who've been through a similar experience, and the shocking thing is that it's actually not terribly uncommon.</p>
<p>Too many men and women are assaulted and left to fend for themselves, in a world that is cruel and indifferent to their struggles. I had those myself, and somehow, I found the will to live. And draw cartoons.</p>
<p>My hope is that this book will enlighten and entertain everyone, and bring even just the tiniest bit of understanding to this very intense and complicated issue.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The biggest risk and challenge here is the content itself - how on Earth do I tell such a wrenching and personal story, without making it too dire and dour to be enjoyable?</p>
<p>That's why I went with a graphic novel; this story is always one that I've been eager to tell, but for the reasons I listed above, I've put it off. Once I hit on making it in cartoon form, though, I realized that it just might work.</p>
<p>I've always loved to draw, even though I'll be the first to admit I'm not the best at it. Still, I love drawing cartoons, and I love writing powerful, funny stories, and this one wraps up both.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>No cash? No problem! See, there's all these Social Media platforms out there, like Twitter and Facebook and Tumblr and the like, where you can share this project with others, who may indeed be interested and wish to contribute!</p>
<p>So get out there with your Internet Bullhorn and help me make I WANT TO BE WELL!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What is Star Burned about?</h3>
<p>   Star Burned is the story of a far off universe where 13 people have each been given a mark called a Star Burn. These marks grant extraordinary power and if one was to gain all 13 marks, one would become god. In this middle of all this you have Zandra, a hunter and a Star Burned who thinks she can outrun even God, is given the job to hunt down another Star Burned, Aidan. Due to a cruel twist of fate Zandra is forced to take care Aidan against all odds from the forces that seek his life, ranging from common criminals to other Star Burned.</p>
<p>     The biggest looming threat to them is a group called The Court of Nynes, a cult that controls all of the magic in the universe. The Court has waited along time for someone in their order to become Star Burned and now finally a son of one of their high leaders has been chosen, Ren, a egotistical psychopath has been granted a Star Burn. His mark is the Mark of Life granting him godlike immortality,but the Court desires him to have all 13 marks so they may have their own god to reshape the galaxy into a place of their own design, purged off all non humans.</p>

<h3>Why is Star Burned Important?</h3>
<p>This project is important for two reasons. 1. It's a dope sci-fi story about people trying to become gods and 2. We pitched the idea to a studio and had it turned down because it was  ""too big"" and we want to show the world that it can be done, even without a huge studio behind us.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So we all know that to take on a big project like this requires big resources as well. We're asking for $25,000 to help us produce this graphic novel. Your donations will be going to fund the work of our artists and our writer. But outside of them is also the production staff as well. We have a great editor on board and a amazing marketing team helping us get the word out! We also will be using the funding to print and mass distribute the graphic novel when the book comes out next year. But of course a portion of what we are raising here is for the cool Star Burned swag we'll be rewarding all of you with!</p>
<p>We have plenty of awesome things for you to get in this campaign such as metal art pieces, T-Shirts, copies of the book and even a chance to create a character in this universe! Now in the worst case scenario that we don't meet the goal the money is still going into the project. First people who donate will get their rewards no matter what, our first priority is making good on our promise to you the donor. Second, the money will go directly to the artists to start production on the graphic novel. Then after that we dust ourselves off, get back on the space horse and go to raise the remaining amount needed to fund the rest of the project.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By helping us in this campaign you are helping a group of young creators achieve their dream on their terms and showing the world that you don't need a big studio to put out a big series. We have put out hundreds of pages of comic book content and we are ready to put out 300 more. Off Shoot Comics prides itself on making sure we constantly bring new and innovative stories to the world and till now we've always done small installments but we are ready for the big time, we have an idea that is too good to die and we believe in it enough to step out on faith and do it on our own.

If this occurs, they will take any resources obtained, put it toward the project, and continue to move forward. The ultimate goal is to develop a self sustaining enterprise through this initial crowd funding venture. The graphic novel is only the first piece to a larger puzzle. General T. Osnofla has already obtained appearance bookings at conventions thoughout the East Coast beginning in February 2016. He, also, is ""the face"" of a heavily anticipated ""con"" or convention in Pennsylvania which will be produced on July 2016 / www.lvitzacon.com.  If The General has the ability to cultivate opportunities  with his current limited resources, imagine what could be done if he obtained additional tools to further his stance.  The graphic novel would be an instrument used to add to his credibility and relevancy. Mel and Al are aware  everyone does not have the ability to give $1000.00 but that does not make them any less valuable than the person who can. They realize there is power in the ""word of mouth"" platform and would appreciate if everyone used it to push General T. Osnofla; especially if they have the willingness to donate but are unable. Utilize this  opportunity  to STILL give by ""spreading the word"" among friends, family, co-workers, etc.Remember, let everyone know to go to Indiegogo.com to donate to The GENERAL LIVES Campaign! .",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>I was born in Kingston Jamaica. I came to Canada in 1978. I’ve been drawing comic books since I was<br/>about six years old. I started with Batman, then Star Wars, then Spiderman, then Superman, then<br/>eventually other books like the X-men and so on. Friends really liked my drawings so in high school I<br/>decided I would attempt making my own comic book. I researched the comic book industry before<br/>eventually releasing my first publication in to local stores called Crossfire. Years later, I would perfect<br/>the material and release my newest material called Dresun. On my journey, I also studied film making<br/>and found I had a passion for film making as well. I made my first film entitled Dresun in 2010 and<br/>played it to an audience of all ages at the local Imax theatre in Ottawa, Canada. This went very well<br/>and so this has lead me even closer to my goal in building a successful production company in comic<br/>books, film making, animation and other related products that youths and families of all ages can<br/>enjoy the benefits of our God given talents and positive ideas.</h3>
<p>The idea for Dresun actually started when I was in high school. I used to draw comic books when a friend told me I should create a black super hero. Black super heroes were hardly heard of so I wasn’t sure if a book with the hero being black would sell, but as I thought about it, I thought that it would be very good for young black youths both male and female and the world community to see a black super hero as a positive, moral, role model that is not perfect, but develops as any other person matures into his potential. So I began working on various ideas that lead me to the modern idea of my first book which is entitled after the name of the main character- Dresun! Dresun is different than other comic books in the sense that the story is centered around the idea that he received his powers as a gift from God. This is important because it sparks an inner struggle that many of us can relate to in man struggling to reach his potential and in the process becoming a better person. As hard a person is, he cannot escape the trials and tribulations of love. Another aspect that the idea is rooted in and also brings balance to the story. Today, we have various black super heroes that are have successfully gone main stream such as Black Panther, Luke Cage, Black Lightning, Cyborg and Spawn. I’d like Dresun to fit right in there and become successful like the above super heroes so that youths of all ages and ethnicities can enjoy the adventures of Dresun and be positively educated whether they see Dresun in the book, on television, in a film or on DVD. These are my goals and aspiration which I’ve already begun and with your generous donation I would like to finish. The funding is to complete a short animated film that mixes animation with real live action as you can see in the teaser and show it at local movie theatres. I also need to print books, make DVDs, Print T-Shirts, attend comic related events, modernize my website as well as purchase marketing and advertising related products and giveaways that would help to popularize Dresun 2 and give it the spark it needs to be successful. So as you can see I am already on my way and your generous contribution would assist in making Dresun a reality!</p>
<p>The challenge we have is in convincing the greater audience to try this new but dynamic adventure comic book. Once the new audience discovers the genius in Dresun, then it becomes easy for them to become return customers which will add to the success of the product. In order to do this the new audience must be able to relate to the new idea. So we must introduce Dresun properly to the new audience so that it not only becomes relatable, but they also become a part of the Dresun universe and follow the stories, events, films, cartoons etc. To establish this relationship it is important for us to talk about Dresun at events as well as have a portion of our product reserved for samples and give aways so that Dresun can become relatable, similar to Superman, Spiderman, the Black Panther and Luke Cage, therefore establishing a connection that allows Dresun to stand the test of time as other comic heroes have stood the test of time.<br/> Another challenge we will take on is distribution to the wider audience. We already have a website put in place where customers can easily download Dresun products, but we would also like to expand to having books and product at larger retail outlets  such as comic shops and department stores as well as entering the film, television and streaming industry with films, series and animation in the near future.</p>

<h3>Two Stories About Magic &amp; Finding Hope</h3>
<p>This campaign is offering up a story of magic, wonder and rising from the depths of depression. <strong>Miseria Loves Company</strong>, is a short 8-page comic. It’s a story about Killian McCabe, a suicidal, hard-boiled detective and Miseria, the Goddess of Despair who saves him. The world is like ours on the surface, but underneath the familiar exterior a vastly different world exists, with magic and danger around every corner.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Killian McCabe, former Police Detective on the edge of ruin.</i></p>
<p>It has wonderful art by David Brame and if we overshoot our goal, this will expand into a longer comic where we tell a story about redemption and dealing with the demons we all have inside.  If we can get to the stretch goal of $3500, then a full 24-page issue will be created and sent out as PDF to all the backers. If we go over that, then more bits of the story will be revealed. If we manage to get to $28,000, then the full first volume (eight chapters!) will be distributed to the backers!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a bonus, a copy of my full length novel, The Left Hand of God will be included in all reward tiers. It’s a story about Tim, a man struggling through life and he gets caught up in a world of magic, intrigue and an ancient artifact that both wizards and angels will do anything to obtain. Along the way, Tim finds his soul-mate, a purpose in life and somehow makes peace with his family.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I wrote both of these when I was feeling really depressed with no real relief in sight. Both of these stories helped me get out of that pain and back into a better state of mind. For a long time, I kept these stories put away, it was enough that just writing them helped me to get out of that mental state. Recently, I let a friend or two read them and it was well received enough that it gave me the push I needed to try and do this to get these stories out into the world.</p>

<p><strong>Josh Gorfain</strong> has written a number of graphic novels and comics since 2009: Sterling for Arcana, an issue of Grimm Tales of Terror (""Bloody Mary"") for Zenescope and his own self-published books, Meatspace (with art by Andrew MacLean and Matthew Furber) and Gamespace (with art by Yuki Saeki). His latest published work was a short story in the Ringo-nominated anthology “All We Ever Wanted” published by A Wave Blue World.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The funds raised will be paying the creators directly, which is good because we can really use the money. If we achieve the stretch goals, we will be able to produce more pages. At this writing, we have the full eight pages of the initial goal completed and over fifty pages of story written with the whole two books plotted out. Your help can make this story a reality!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risks are very small, as everything is done and they both need minimal work to get them ready to completion, setting up copyrights, final production, etc. All the heavy lifting is already done. Since both stories will only be delivered digitally, there's no worrying about printing and the problems that can arise with that. The challenge comes in if we manage to hit our stretch goal to produce the pages as fast as I want which is instantaneously.</p>

<h3>The Scarlet Knight:Defender of the Block</h3>
<p>The Scarlet Knight:Defender of the Block is about two cousins who return back to their hometown where they were raised by their grandparents after Medical school to be ER doctors, but find a magic gem that makes them knights in the modern day times.</p>

<p>In this Issue, our main character is trying to make everything right again in order to save his beloved cousin and city, but the gem has created a few more creatures along with a crooked politician, whose intentions aren't in the best interest of all.  In order to make everything whole, Phoenix must follow Merlin's exact instructions, or be forced to watch everything crumble.</p>

<h3>Who are You?</h3>
<p>Juaquan Herron aka Jay Allen was a kid that grew up in inner city Kansas City. My mother had me at a early age, so I would have television when she would work those long hours. I also had great grandparents that loved cinema. I loved movies so much I became an actor, and soon transitioned to writing, because I believed my hood folks stories weren't being told in fantasy, horror, and sci-fi content. It was like only the burbs and country folks would experience these things. I would think ""If a zombie apocalypse broke out in the world, how would the block handle it"". I took that as a opportunity to start writing  our stories after doing my bid in Los Angeles acting and writing. I started the comic book company as a dedication to my grandparents who passed away 3 years ago. I even placed their likeness in the series.</p>

<h2>Tired of Hollywood and corporations stealing indigenous identity, culture, art, ceremony and traditions?? We're fighting to protect indigenous stories and people through digital copyright.

Tired of Hollywood and corporations stealing indigenous identity, culture, art, ceremony and traditions?? We're fighting to protect indigenous stories and people through digital copyright. WE ARE AN INDIGENOUS PRODUCTION COMPANY. All of the productions we produce are in partnership with real indigenous peoples. The views reflected in our productions hold traditional and cultural accuracy. We produce indigenous media to serve as intellectual property copyright protection for the individuals and nations who contribute to our projects. We want to see movie titles with Indigenous representation on the Hollywood big screens funded by majority owned indigenous companies. We want to encourage and identify with our indigenous youth and the next generations of future leaders to show that WE CONTROL OUR NARRATIVE. In order for us to influence Hollywood, big studios and corporations, we need to create and produce AMAZING indigenous content with your support! Our stories will reflect the injustice of colonization against indigenous peoples using real historical events.

<h3>A cosa serve il vostro contributo?</h3>
<p>Il libro è interamente autoprodotto, e stampare un libro di buona 
qualità è molto costoso per chiunque scelga di non appoggiarsi ad una 
casa editrice. Quindi, del traguardo prefissato, 3.000€ sono destinati a
 coprire i costi di stampa per la totalità di 1.000 volumi in formato A4
 orizzontale, rilegati a brossura filo refe. Gli altri 500€, invece, 
copriranno le percentuali di Indiegogo, di Paypal ed altre ed eventuali.<br/>
Qualora la somma non venisse raggiunta, qualunque contributo parziale 
sarebbe comunque di grande aiuto al fine della realizzazione del 
progetto.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435669038/qhtjkuragt29mjl9evka.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Why is your contribution needed?</h3>
<p>The book is entirely self-produced, and printing a book of good quality is very expensive for anyone who chooses not to rely on a publisher. Therefore, € 3,000 of the set goal, are intended to cover printing costs for the total of 1000 volumes in A4 album format, bound in paperback cotton thread. The other € 500, however, will cover the costs of Indiegogo, Paypal and other any other service.<br/>
If the goal is not reached, any partial contribution would still be of great help to the completion of the project.</p>

<h3>Wozu dient Ihr Beitrag?</h3>
<p>Das Buch ist komplett selbst selbstproduziert, und ein Buch von guter Qualität zu drucken ist sehr teuer für alle, die keinen Verlag gewählt haben. Daher ist das Ziel 3.000 €. Diese sollen die Druckkosten decken für Insgesamt 1000 Bücher in A4-format, mit Kartonumschlag und klassischer Einbindung Die weiteren 500 € sollen die Provisionen von Indiegogo, Paypal, sowie die Versandkosten decken.<br/>
Sofern die Summe nicht erreicht wird, wird jeder Teilbeitrag immer noch eine große Hilfe für die Fertigstellung des Projekts sein.</p>

Lasciamo parlare le immagini.

What is Sex sells?

Sex sells is a collection of comics by the artist Norbert Niessen. A concentration of clichés and forbidden dreams about sex, religion and politics.
The self-produced book will contain about 100 watercolor images and will be published in three languages, Italian, English and German.
A mix of artistic quality and clever satire that won't miss out on putting a smile on the face of the most conservative readers.
Let the images speak for themselves.

Was ist Sex sells

Eine Mischung aus künstlerischer Qualität und kluger Satire, die jedem ein Lächeln abgewinnen wird.
Lasst die Bilder sprechen.








A cosa serve il vostro contributo?
Il libro è interamente autoprodotto, e stampare un libro di buona 
qualità è molto costoso per chiunque scelga di non appoggiarsi ad una 
casa editrice. Quindi, del traguardo prefissato, 3.000€ sono destinati a
 coprire i costi di stampa per la totalità di 1.000 volumi in formato A4
 orizzontale, rilegati a brossura filo refe. Gli altri 500€, invece, 
copriranno le percentuali di Indiegogo, di Paypal ed altre ed eventuali.
Qualora la somma non venisse raggiunta, qualunque contributo parziale 
sarebbe comunque di grande aiuto al fine della realizzazione del 
progetto.

Why is your contribution needed?
The book is entirely self-produced, and printing a book of good quality is very expensive for anyone who chooses not to rely on a publisher. Therefore, € 3,000 of the set goal, are intended to cover printing costs for the total of 1000 volumes in A4 album format, bound in paperback cotton thread. The other € 500, however, will cover the costs of Indiegogo, Paypal and other any other service.
If the goal is not reached, any partial contribution would still be of great help to the completion of the project.

Wozu dient Ihr Beitrag?
Das Buch ist komplett selbst selbstproduziert, und ein Buch von guter Qualität zu drucken ist sehr teuer für alle, die keinen Verlag gewählt haben. Daher ist das Ziel 3.000 €. Diese sollen die Druckkosten decken für Insgesamt 1000 Bücher in A4-format, mit Kartonumschlag und klassischer Einbindung Die weiteren 500 € sollen die Provisionen von Indiegogo, Paypal, sowie die Versandkosten decken.
Sofern die Summe nicht erreicht wird, wird jeder Teilbeitrag immer noch eine große Hilfe für die Fertigstellung des Projekts sein.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","Hi, everyone.
Levi here. I'm the director and co-writer of Maybe Sunshine, a music oriented comedy for the web about a woman in her 40s getting her band, Radiana, going in New York City.
I'm an actor and a director working around New York City and sometimes LA. I met this amazing woman named Lisa Hammer. She's been working in the film/TV industry for years, as well. She is mostly easily recognized as the voice of Triana Orpheus in the popular Adult Swim cartoon, the Venture Bros. But people may not know that she had an extensive music career before that in bands that headlined all over the East Coast and especially popular in the New York goth scene.
She told me some amazing stories about her tours some of which I can barely believe are real.
I thought to myself, ""Her life in the music industry would make a great show!""
We had just finished a movie in Utah and we were high on the proverbial hog and decided, let's make this show.
But, you see, this isn't a normal show. We actually have music! This show features her newest band, Radiana! Which meant we had to hire actors who could play instruments and intrumentalists who would act. I won't even mention the band manager, vampires, goth radio DJs, and the rival band!
We've already shot a lot of stuff over the last few months, five out of six episodes, and we've tested it and gotten a lot of good feedback including winning the Audience Choice Award at IndieWorks in New York.

We are on the last stretch and what we need is finishing funds to wrap up the show, shoot one final episode, some incidentals and pickup sequences, and all of the post production.
We also have opportunities to help us finish music production for our theme song which we will release as a full single.
We have a lot of fun stuff to offer as premiums including CDs of Radiana, stickers and buttons, Radiana t-shirts, and images of Triana Orpheus signed by Lisa Hammer and more.
Here's the thing: This show has been a labor of love. It's a beautiful and fun and fantastical story about being a woman in New York City as she navigates the much younger music scene. I, personally, love Radiana. Lisa has one of the most amazing voices out there, on many levels.
We have great producers in Sean Mannion and Carolyn Maher, both accomplished producers and filmmakers, and Myles Tyrer-Vasell, our passionate Director of Photography and Cinematographer. I can't even begin to mention everyone who have volunteered their efforts to make this show into a reality.Our exciting guest stars include:  stand-up comedians, rock stars, film/TV stars and new discoveries: 
 comedian Adam Phillips (B.E.T. Comic View, Conan O'Brien, 30 Rock), rock
 musician Voltaire (Projekt Records), comedienne Darra Boyd (Flavor of

<p><strong>Hello, my good people!</strong><br/>I am Maja and I am an illustrator/designer/cartoonist. I am passionate about my job, working in creative industries like ... forever, let's say I am pretty much a seasoned creative, working on a wide range of creative stuff for all sorts of clients. Without fake modesty, I am proud to say I am very good at my job. HOWEVER ...</p>

<p><strong>My dreams.</strong><br/>However, for a long time, I work on assignments for clients only.<br/>There is freedom in this type of work, you get creative rewards,<br/>but let's face it: freelancing as an artist today is not as financially<br/>rewarding as one would wish.<br/>Without finances, well, one cannot really develop, learn, live.<br/>I have a dream though.<br/>Making my own cartoon characters alive and get people engaged in my creations.<br/>I have a bunch of them congregating in my head, buzzing around and knocking on<br/>the insides of my skull. I have to have a plan for them. And goals.</p>

<p><strong>The plan and goals.</strong><br/>My primary plan is to develop and establish an independent cartoon-illustration website, a home of <strong>a member-only weekly e-magazine</strong>, intended only for you, my future subscribers.</p>
<p>I will publish some free stuff on this website, so if you don't subscribe you are on free stuff diet, but If you subscribe, you receive your own copy of the weekly e-magazine, with a bunch of goodies thrown in.</p>
<p><strong>The content of weekly e-magazine will have 4 sections:</strong></p>
<p>1. A weekly cartoon / comic strip</p>
<p>2. An illustrated children book story, with leading female character<br/>(1 chapter per magazine issue)</p>
<p>3. One illustrated coloring page</p>
<p>4. An illustrated puzzle</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I have set a low $ goal</strong> with the clear intention it gets hit and exceeded, so this project can run on and raise funds indefinitely.<strong> </strong><strong>First 28 days of crowdfunding this project is therefore very important, I sincerely count on you, my good people! </strong></p>
<p><strong>The goal of 1900 $</strong> will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>the necessary expenses for the development of a proper cartoon-illustration website</li>
<li>design and printing of one t-shirt edition, with a release date October 2018</li>
<li>3 issues of a weekly e-magazine, with a starting release date in January 2019</li>
<li>some advertising fees</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If we break the initial goal of 1900 $ and it goes beyond 8000$</strong>, the project starts getting wings. Funds will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>heftier advertising budget</li>
<li>design and printing of second t-shirt edition</li>
<li>setting up and organizing an e-shop</li>
<li>at least another 6 issues of a weekly e-magazine</li>
<li>creation of a printed coloring book</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If a goal goes well beyond 18.000$. </strong>Dream scenario! We will have:</p>
<ul>
<li>big advertising budget</li>

</div></div>","Hello, my good people!I am Maja and I am an illustrator/designer/cartoonist. I am passionate about my job, working in creative industries like ... forever, let's say I am pretty much a seasoned creative, working on a wide range of creative stuff for all sorts of clients. Without fake modesty, I am proud to say I am very good at my job. HOWEVER ...
Here you can leaf through my portfolio.

My dreams.However, for a long time, I work on assignments for clients only.There is freedom in this type of work, you get creative rewards,but let's face it: freelancing as an artist today is not as financiallyrewarding as one would wish.Without finances, well, one cannot really develop, learn, live.I have a dream though.Making my own cartoon characters alive and get people engaged in my creations.I have a bunch of them congregating in my head, buzzing around and knocking onthe insides of my skull. I have to have a plan for them. And goals.

The plan and goals.My primary plan is to develop and establish an independent cartoon-illustration website, a home of a member-only weekly e-magazine, intended only for you, my future subscribers.
I will publish some free stuff on this website, so if you don't subscribe you are on free stuff diet, but If you subscribe, you receive your own copy of the weekly e-magazine, with a bunch of goodies thrown in.
The content of weekly e-magazine will have 4 sections:
1. A weekly cartoon / comic strip
2. An illustrated children book story, with leading female character(1 chapter per magazine issue)
3. One illustrated coloring page
4. An illustrated puzzle
 
I have set a low $ goal with the clear intention it gets hit and exceeded, so this project can run on and raise funds indefinitely. First 28 days of crowdfunding this project is therefore very important, I sincerely count on you, my good people! 
The goal of 1900 $ will cover:

the necessary expenses for the development of a proper cartoon-illustration website
design and printing of one t-shirt edition, with a release date October 2018
3 issues of a weekly e-magazine, with a starting release date in January 2019
some advertising fees

If we break the initial goal of 1900 $ and it goes beyond 8000$, the project starts getting wings. Funds will cover:

heftier advertising budget
design and printing of second t-shirt edition
setting up and organizing an e-shop
at least another 6 issues of a weekly e-magazine
creation of a printed coloring book

If a goal goes well beyond 18.000$. Dream scenario! We will have:

big advertising budget
design and printing of another t-shirt edition
creation and printing of one children book
at least another 6 issues of a weekly e-magazine
design and printing of a children book
design and printing of a comic book

 
You will not leave empty-handed!I will not allow my backers go empty-handed. All the perks will be fulfilled. My subscribers, even if it happens to be a small number of them will get what they paid for.
 
Thank you, thank you, thank you! In the end, I wish to say this: There are no words to describe the gratitude, respect, and humility I feel for you, my backers and supporters! Your contribution will make a massive even vital difference for me.
 
Have a peek at my drawing board:
A character for a children story I wrote ... This sketch made some time ago actually made me start writing the story.

A sketch of a girl, a leading character in my children story.

<h3>Who are the Dementorbusters and where did they come from?</h3>
<p>After Voldemort was defeated, the wizarding world thought they were safe.  However, dementor attacks are on the rise and no one really seems to notice except a select few.  Cassie, an auror from the Ministry of Magic, is tasked with getting the dementors back under control.  It's a rough job, but somebody has to do it!  And it isn't easy...the attacks are becoming more frequent and widely spread out...but are they as random as they seem?  Cassie knows she needs help.  'Expecto Patronum' just isn't cutting it!  It does nothing to help capture or control the dementors and time is running out!  Mr. Weasley, being obsessed with Muggles, hears of a team from New York City who calls themselves the Ghostbusters.  He learns of their cutting edge technology that allows them to trap ghostly and spectral beings.  Needless to say, he was more than intrigued.  Mr. Weasley contacts Egon Spengler and explains the situation and his dire need for his help.  Thus, 'Weasley Spengler Enterprises' is born!  Putting their heads together, they are able to combine magic and nuclear energy to create a whole new pack that will allow 'Expecto Patronum' to transform.  Now the spell can be used to capture a dementor instead of simply expelling it!  Now, Cassie can start to really make a difference.  But...there's a catch...Cassie is a wizard and completely unfamiliar and untrained when it comes to nuclear energy.  She is forced to take on a partner.  Someone from another world.  Someone inexperienced in the ways of magic.  Someone...who is a Muggle.  Kreg, a resident NYC Ghostbuster, is tasked with the job of teaching nuclear tech to Cassie; however he will learn a lot in the process as well and a partnership blossoms.  This unlikely duo must band together and become the first ever DEMENTORBUSTERS!</p>

<p><strong>The Dude</strong> is a series about a mercenary martial artist hailed as one of the worlds most beloved ""heroes"" who unbeknownst to everyone else is actually just a 16 year old boy trying to earn money for his mom's medical treatments. But as evil forces grow and unite, he finds himself having to step up beyond his initial goals and truly become the hero everyone believes him to be across this exciting <strong>Trilogy Series.</strong> All while an incredibly busty reporter seeks to uncover the truth about him</p>
<p><strong>The Dude Vol #1</strong> is the 1st of a <strong>3 Volume</strong> Action-Adventure Series, each containing <strong>5 Chapters</strong>, with roughly <strong>30 Pages</strong> of Story per Chapter</p>

<p>Joseph is just a kid with a simple desire, to save his Mom. Though unfortunately, her medical treatments cost an arm &amp; a leg, and that's not even getting into the funds required to secure her transplant. There's no way an average kid could even put a dent in the expenses, but then again your average kid can't run over <strong>100 miles</strong> per hour, survive <strong>100,000 ft</strong> drops &amp; throw <strong>giant boulders</strong> over the horizon <i>(roughly 3 miles)</i></p>
<p>Thus he took up Mercenary work at just<strong> 14 years old</strong>, travelling all over the world while telling his parents that he had an internship with a Travel Agency. And after stopping a Terrorist Attack on the UN, his alter ego became World famous and became known as <i><strong>The Dude</strong></i></p>

<p>Did you take one look at Sally and instantly thought ""<strong>BOOBS!!!</strong>""? Well then, you're in trouble. Why? Cause while you were staring at her Tits, she was grilling you for information, which you then unknowingly gave her. But don't feel too bad, Sally in an incredibly attractive woman: Girls share your desire to stare at her Boobs, Gay Guys have gone Straight for her &amp; she even gives the Impotent erections</p>
<p>But due to her Beauty, most fail to realize her Intelligence until it's too late, and she has fully exploited that in her career as a Reporter, but even then she knows she can't afford to be a one-trick pony, even if it's an <strong>extremely</strong> effective trick. Thus even if you've gotten used to her ample bosom, you best keep your guard up, or she'll dig up anything you're trying to hide as though it was low-hanging fruit</p>
<p>If Sally has any blind spots, it would be her fangirl crush on The Dude, whom she's actually met a few times. Not that he's aware of it</p>

Disgraced & Shunned after been accused of promoting Violence, Vihaan has turned to a life of Crime in order to not only regain the luxuries he once had, but also to gain newfound glory and prove his new Art to the World.
Vihaan has no doubt he can succeed in his goals, and wherever he goes he rubs his superiority in the face of whoever will listen. With his movements unpredictable and his strikes deadly, his fighting only goes to back up this attitude

About Me
Honestly, I'm just your Average Guy. I get by day-to-day and have a part time job. If there's anything truly interesting about me, it's my love for stories and my overexcited imagination constantly buzzing ablaze creating new ones. And I have turned that into a Dream, to share my stories and bring joy to people, just like so many others work have entertained people like they have me.
And to do that, I have been inspired to create my own Brand, to craft an new universe filled with Wonder & Adventure, where almost anything is possible. Thus I have founded Noble Comics, with this story been but the first to come in the many I have imagined for the NobleVerse.
I genuinely hope it puts a smile on your face, and fills your heart with joy, all while inspiring a new Generation of Writers & Artists. Thank You!",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>my name is Michael D. Hall. I also go by SPECSWIZARD. I've written and drawn comics for almost 40 years. I also write and produce Hip Hop music.</p>
<p>I am campaigning to raise funds to print a graphic novel called ACHIEVER Takes Down The MAN. ACHIEVER is a character I created while working at Zanadu Comics 20 years ago. from a young age my dream was to someday publish my own comic titles. I'm ready to share my ideas with the world.</p>
<p>I am hoping to consistently release comics and build a following. I hope to learn from the experience and eventually solidify a place amongst the greater self publishing community.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>For almost 20 years I have worked in the comics industry as a freelance colorist, an editor, writer and creator.  Most of that time has been spent freelance coloring and helping make your favorite comics come out each and every month, and occasionally getting to do a project for myself.</p>
<p>Honesty, I'm tired of spending my best energy and time helping to create and make other people's dreams come true or helping whichever corporation to meet a bottom line.  When I do get to create comics on my own, I am met with critical praise if not big sale numbers.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>WHY? </b></p>
<p>I'll be completely candid.  Every comic I've written and/or created in the traditional comic industry has never paid me.  I've made this book with my own $$$, hiring the best I artist for the job, and having some incredible friends work with me to create some epic variant covers.</p>
<p>With IGG and KS, I can do the work and make the absolute best comics and interact with you, the fan, on a one on one basis to meet and exceed your expectations, and maybe make back some of the money I've spent and invest in new projects that will come after Sasquanaut.</p>
<p>So far I have run 3 successful campaigns on Kickstarter, and one less successful followup campaign on IGG.  </p>
<p><strong>My campaigns were funded, produced, and delivered to customers EARLIER than promised.</strong></p>
<p>I accomplish this by having the book 100% complete before I even launch the campaign, so you know that your money will go directly into printing and production, and not leave you wondering where your book is for months or years as SOME creators do.</p>
<p>There is <strong>NO RISK</strong> that the books won't come out because they are done.</p>
<p>But lets be real. </p>
<p>COVID-19 has messed up everything. There are potential lingering effects of the global pandemic that might influence the production schedule.</p>
<p>Because of that, I have planned some extra time into my production and fulfillment schedule to account for any potential backlog or delays at the printer.  The printer has been closed or operating in a limited capacity like most other businesses in the country, so that's the only real potential delay.</p>
<p>There is a very good chance that everything will proceed as it regularly would prior to the COVID-19 crisis, and if that's the case, fulfillment should be done faster than scheduled. </p>
<p>I pride myself on my communication and professionalism, and your trust in me is not taken lightly.  You can easily find my past two campaigns and see I have made regular updates detailing the status and progress on every step of the campaign.</p>
<p>And I'm taking it even further this time.  Every Tuesday night, join me on Twitch as I continue to produce and create Sasquanaut right before you eyes one page at a time.  Join the conversation about the creative process and ask any questions on how to make a comic and know without a doubt that your money is being put to work. </p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As a crowd funding supporter myself, I know what it means to give your hard earned money to new and unknown projects.</p>
<p>I have made every effort to minimize the risk to you, the backer.  </p>
<p>This includes having the issue 100% completed before you even see this page.  </p>
<p>At my own expense I have paid and received ALL the art from Gab Santos for the entire 6 issues of volume 1.</p>
<p>This campaign is full of merchandise and original art that is already completed and of the absolute highest quality, as well as being ready to ship to make the fulfillment process as brief and efficient as possible.</p>
<p>When the campaign successfully ends, with your help, the files will be loaded to the printer when the funding comes in, digital rewards can be sent upon receiving completed surveys, and coloring and lettering can continue on all remaining issues.</p>
<p>Issues 1, 2, and 3 Kickstarter campaigns and fulfillment went as smoothly as I could possibly hope for, and so far I have received universal praise on the quality and timeliness of the projects. That's not to say I didn't learn a few things that I believe will better assist in completing and shipping all rewards to everyone.</p>
<p>I love this book and I want everyone who takes part of this campaign to love this book as much as I and have a completely satisfied experience on Kickstarter with me and Gab. </p>
<p><strong><i>My experience with IndieGoGo is limited, and working the interface to build the campaign has been a bit of a struggle.  I have attempted to make the choice of variant cover as part of the ""OPTIONS"" in the perks.  I hope this works as I believe it should, otherwise there could be some confusion and difficulty.</i></strong></p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to message me and I will do my absolute best to make this project as rewarding as possible.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and your support!</p>

SAVAGE SASQUANAUT is a fish out of water story about the legendary Bigfoot who was part of a NASA experiment when a freak accident lost him in space!

WHAT'S HAPPENING IN ISSUE FOUR?

Traveling through the depths of space, Sasquanaut awakens to find himself back on Earth!  
As the days and years go by, he slowly realizes this is not his world, and this is not his forest throne.  Yeah, he has a forest throne!?!?!
And so he asks himself, ""How did I get here!?"" and before he can consider this too deeply, a mysterious woman appears and offers him anything and everything he can dream of!  
Will Sasquanaut fall under her spell and surrender his will to her whims, or will he realize his deepest desires and set himself free?

There is a very good chance that everything will proceed as it regularly would prior to the COVID-19 crisis, and if that's the case, fulfillment should be done faster than scheduled. 
I pride myself on my communication and professionalism, and your trust in me is not taken lightly.  You can easily find my past two campaigns and see I have made regular updates detailing the status and progress on every step of the campaign.
And I'm taking it even further this time.  Every Tuesday night, join me on Twitch as I continue to produce and create Sasquanaut right before you eyes one page at a time.  Join the conversation about the creative process and ask any questions on how to make a comic and know without a doubt that your money is being put to work. 

 
 
 
 
 
Risks & Challenges
As a crowd funding supporter myself, I know what it means to give your hard earned money to new and unknown projects.
I have made every effort to minimize the risk to you, the backer.  
This includes having the issue 100% completed before you even see this page.  
At my own expense I have paid and received ALL the art from Gab Santos for the entire 6 issues of volume 1.
This campaign is full of merchandise and original art that is already completed and of the absolute highest quality, as well as being ready to ship to make the fulfillment process as brief and efficient as possible.
When the campaign successfully ends, with your help, the files will be loaded to the printer when the funding comes in, digital rewards can be sent upon receiving completed surveys, and coloring and lettering can continue on all remaining issues.
Issues 1, 2, and 3 Kickstarter campaigns and fulfillment went as smoothly as I could possibly hope for, and so far I have received universal praise on the quality and timeliness of the projects. That's not to say I didn't learn a few things that I believe will better assist in completing and shipping all rewards to everyone.
I love this book and I want everyone who takes part of this campaign to love this book as much as I and have a completely satisfied experience on Kickstarter with me and Gab. 
My experience with IndieGoGo is limited, and working the interface to build the campaign has been a bit of a struggle.  I have attempted to make the choice of variant cover as part of the ""OPTIONS"" in the perks.  I hope this works as I believe it should, otherwise there could be some confusion and difficulty.
If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to message me and I will do my absolute best to make this project as rewarding as possible.
Thank you for your time and your support!

</p></div>","SAMSARA SAGA begins... 
For 2 millennia, the sovereign system of Dylae had been locked in a brutal conflict with the conquering Kait Armada until an advanced alien race calling themselves the Vyzemun suddenly appeared. It didn’t take long for these seemingly benevolent, alien drifters to overpower both sides and eventually settle the fighting among them. 
This event is known to all throughout the Galaxy as the Halting.  
Our story starts almost 1,000 after the Halting. To mark the millennial anniversary, a celebration of stellar proportions will occur to usher in the new age of galactic prosperity. 
Now, the Vyzemun serve the galaxy as mediators and benefactors to all beings. As inhabitants recover from their severe case of galactic PTSD, they begin to expand their territory. For a thousand years, the Dylae and Kait have coexisted by never stepping foot in the others' quadrant of the galaxy. But with colonial expansion leading ever outward, even the Vyzemun are having trouble keeping tabs on everyone. 





Enter the Primordial Epoch... 

Traverse the cosmos, in a storybook space opera from the collaborative minds of Ruel Deguzman and Christopher Harris (Xenobrane Studios). SAMSARA SAGA is a romp-n-stomp, science-fantasy graphic novel. It's filled with all our favorite aspects of sci-fi, joined with all the trimmings that make us smile thinking about the fantasy genre. 
On the surface SAMSARA SAGA is a fun, witty, dramatic, action-packed space opera set in a galaxy shrouded in star dust. We’ll have a variety of life-forms, planets, magic and science! We took our favorite elements of Sci-fi and Fantasy and merged them into a holy union of awesome. For example we have a magic wielding race called the Dylaed coexisting with cybernetic beings called Vyzemun.

Are you tired of not getting enough blood-magic?!
Ever find yourself wondering what a talking fungal life form would look like?!
Wish to splice up the whole cybernetic modified organics deal?!
If you said yes to all these questions, then SAMSARA SAGA is for you!
Like the title implies, this will be a SAGA. If you’re unfamiliar with the word “samsara” |səmˈsärə|, it’s basically the repeating cycle of birth, life and death…. In that order. We took this concept and applied it to our favorite types of stories. Our project, SAMSARA SAGA, is the direct result of the melding of our minds. The theme of SAMSARA is an amalgamation of experiences all connected by multiple threads, unified by the singular concept of change. 
With SAMSARA SAGA, sparks of an expansive series ignite. What comes next is a multi-verse born from the imagination bang!

When Vladamir Putin decides to implement his own version of the NSA spying program, Edward Snowden's security is put at risk.  Ecuadorian officials offer asylum, but getting there may be trouble as the NSA wishes to shut up Snowden once and for all. Can the Voluntaryists get Snowden to safety in time before the governments get to him? Join us in this epic battle to expose invasive government spying as the Voluntaryists take on the NSA in their most daring adventure yet! The Voluntaryists versus the NSA!

 
HISTORY: Voluntaryist
was created by liberty fanatic and costumer Jaime Sherman, whose passion for
liberty is only matched by his passion for cosplay photography. He began the
long process of creating the series while trudging through his graduate
studies.
GOAL: To
get The Voluntaryists versus the NSA in digital copy and print to share with you,
and, eventually, the world via a free download.
PAGE COUNT: 18-22 new pages estimated for a 100% funded campaign.
 We will produce as much of
the comic as we can get funded for! The storyline may be adjusted to tailor to the
funding level.




   What We Need & What You Get

$6,000 to get this comic’s potential fully going.

While the comic is a fictional storyline, our hope is that the comic is something that goes beyond its entertainment value. We would like the comic to get into the hands of people who are unfamiliar with the NSA's spying and the current state of affairs. We want to wake people up to Voluntaryism and truly-free living using the comic medium because it breaks traditional genre barriers.PUBLIC RELEASE:We will be releasing the comic to download for free eventually, but those who paid to get the comic e-mailed or printed will receive it FIRST and will receive the comic about a month AHEAD of everyone else.SO, with that in mind, don’t be shy about supporting at the $2 or $6 levels because EVERY dollar counts to making the comic come into existence.

We need your help!
Contributions will be used to improve the software used for the 3D Digital Comic Books, as well as upgrades to the servers that will host them. This will be directly proportional to the number of contributions we get. Also, they will cover expenses made while negotiating with DC, Marvel, Image, and many other Comic Publishers.There is always the risk that negotiations with these publishers take longer than expected, and that's why we need your contribution! If we can show them what an Amazing system we have, and that we have the Comic Book Fan Community Support, we can make this Dream come True! So tell your friends and family, and lets make this a reality!",17.0,2,"1 Campaign

<div><a href=""http://demonwings.thecomicseries.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Demon Wings</a></div> <p>My name is Christina (Kiki) Godek, I'm 23, and I've always wanted to be a comic artist. I originally came up with a comic idea, The Academy, back in 2009. It never came out the way I wanted, so to pass time while my friend worked on it with me, I decided to make a backstory for one of the characters, a succubus named Leandra. It helped me flesh her out as a character, and helped my art improve. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1426152/files/20150429101717-compare.png?1430327837"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The story follows Leandra, who doesn't want to live in her realm anymore because she can't go through with all of the sadistic actions that the other demons do normally. She has a little sister type friend, Candy, who becomes more sadistic as Leandra becomes empathetic, and Dagger, a mysterious succubus who seems to aid them, but doesn't fully seem on their side. It is a mature story, however, with violence and graphic content, intended for people 16 and older.<p></p>
<p>I've always wanted a physical copy of a book I made to hold, and that's what I want to do. </p>
<p>Helping me are my two best friends, Hugh Otterson, and (formerly known as Cygnus) Rin. Rin is basically a professional artist, but with his cancer, it's hard for him to work or find work. I wanted to include him to give him a job of sorts and be able to pay him for helping me. He helps with promotional art, coloring, and digitally inking. None of this would be possible without him.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I set my goal for $1000, but if it could get more, that would be great! The money I receive from the funds would go towards printing the books, shipping them to people, and making extra goodies for the higher tiers. If there was anything left after everything was taken care of, that money is going to Rin to help with his hospital bills. I haven't been able to pay him much for his help, so I want to make up for it if I can.</p>
<p>Even if I don't make it to $1000, I'll still use everything to print, ship out the books to people who donated, and send their tier perks. I will also be printing additional books to take to some indie comic book stores to sell.</p>
<p>The book will also include the original strips I made for when I first started Demon Wings, along with original artwork, concept art, fanart, and more. The comic is on a weekly update status, so the book will contain pages that won't be released for weeks, even months. You'll get the whole story at once! I'm also adding extra pages to the story that will expand on what happened between Candy and Leandra when they first met, and will help tie the old plot and the new plot together.</p>
<p><b>Tier Perks:</b></p>
<p><b>$5:</b> Your name will be added to the Thank You page in the back of the book for all of the contributors and a print of promo artwork. (All higher tiers will automatically have your name in it)</p>
<p><b>$10:</b> You will receive a copy of the book, signed with a personal thank you from me.</p>
<p><b>$15:</b> You will receive a signed copy of the book, along with prints of original artwork, and buttons of Leandra, Candy, and Dagger.</p>
<p><b>$25:</b> You will receive a signed copy of the book, the prints, the buttons, and a personal sketch of Leandra for you, however you want me to draw her, and a note from me.</p>
<p><b>$50:</b> You will receive a signed copy of the book, the prints, the buttons, and I will draw a picture of you as a demon, and also incorporate it into the story.</p>
<p><b>$100: </b>You will receive a signed copy of the book, the prints, the buttons, a cameo as a demon, and a photo of my cat with the book and my Leandra plushies, signed with his name on the back.</p> </div> <div> <h3>How this will help my comic</h3> <p></p>Making an IndieGogo will help spread the word of my comic immensely and hopefully bring some new readers.

Let me introduce myself a bit better, I'm a 23 year old athlete (basketball of course!) with a degree in Graphic Design and Production here in Portugal. There have always been two things I remember doing my whole life: Comics and Sports. My two passions let's put it that way. Since I was a little kid I was always fascinated by carefully built fantasy universes like Lord of the Rings, Naruto, Star Wars, the Marvel &amp; DC Universe, just to name a few. And like any kid, I always dreamed of building one of my own. And that’s why we're here!</p><p>Four years ago I started to create a universe called No Place For Heroes, where all of my comics would take place and relate to each other. A world with magic and advanced technology, but that followed a hard set of rules and limitations so that it would feel as real as possible.

Let me introduce myself a bit better, I'm a 23 year old athlete (basketball of course!) with a degree in Graphic Design and Production here in Portugal. There have always been two things I remember doing my whole life: Comics and Sports. My two passions let's put it that way. Since I was a little kid I was always fascinated by carefully built fantasy universes like Lord of the Rings, Naruto, Star Wars, the Marvel & DC Universe, just to name a few. And like any kid, I always dreamed of building one of my own. And that’s why we're here!Four years ago I started to create a universe called No Place For Heroes, where all of my comics would take place and relate to each other. A world with magic and advanced technology, but that followed a hard set of rules and limitations so that it would feel as real as possible. My dream Universe seemed far away to achieve when in January 2018 new members started to join my journey, today we're over 15 people and have completed the first issue of three titles and have 3 more in production. The World that is No Place For Heroes is ready to come forward to the public and make its debut.The start of the No Place For Heroes Universe is marked by the release of its first 3 titles: Full Blaze, Rogue Dragon and Warper!

<p>My name is Emilio Rodriguez and I am the founder of Tres Calaveras Studios, a studio dedicated to creating worlds that people are going to want to be a part of and share with others.  It is also the aim of the studio to introduce some much-needed diversity to comics and comic concepts.  However, it is not enough to have characters or creators that are diverse - one must endeavor to produce quality while promoting diversity.  After all, diversity without quality is merely a book with a minority character. </p>
<p>I am an attorney and a college professor who has always possessed an ardent love for comics, and have read and written them since my earliest years.  This campaign is important to me because I wish to create a world that people are going to want to be a part of and share with others.  It is also important to me to help show the genre is capable of depth and character development that can stand against any other. </p>
<p>The risks are few because the book is done for a debut at the NY Comic Con in October 2016.  Therefore, those who pledge are not going to have to wait long for their rewards.  My studio has put out three issues of a series called Sara Rising, also a sci-fi series; therefore we know what goes into completing a book and getting it out to the public.       </p>
<p>The funding needed is $5500.  This money is going to the artistic/lettering team for finishing the book.  Additional funds will go to publishing costs, Indiegogo fees, and marketing costs. </p>

<p>Even if you can't contribute, you can help by spreading the word and making some raucous noise about the campaign.  We don't do this to create in a vacuum.  We do it to bring joy, creativity, and a damn good story to the world. Thanks everyone! </p>

Landing in the city of Neo Kyoto, he built an advanced steampunk lab deep underneath his home to conduct scientific experiments.  Many may consider the lab to be antique junk now, but those machines are state of the art even today – 130 years later –because Dr. Z’s steampunk lab runs on the etheric energy from the Toltec crystals.The modern setting for the story is Neo Kyoto, a bustling metropolis alongside the Pacific Ocean in the not so distant future.  It’s a city of peace and every day tranquility, but unbeknownst to its citizens there is a magical crystal buried underneath the city that holds the power to destroy the world or bring good to it.Who will save this world you ask?...Shiba Inu’s?  Yes, Shiba Inu's! A new breed of heroes comes alive when seven teenage Shiba Inu friends tap into a new reality using a mythical technology that gives them tremendous abilities and unique powers, with magic Toltec Crystals as their main energy source. These high-tech heroes are the Shiba Squad™!Shiba Squad™ is an original comic book series created by award winning artist Vic Guiza and a group of successful writers and friends that wanted to create animated content that represents where we are today and where we want to go in the future.  The idea was spawned by a need for purpose driven content, a nostalgia for comic books, and a love for Shiba Inu dogs!  The story follows a group of young Shiba’s living in Neo Kyoto™ navigating their way through school and regular household chores.  One day, a young red Shiba Inu dog, named Maximus aka ""Max"", the protagonist of the story, finds an abandoned tree house, which happens to be the secret emergency exit of Dr. Z’s underground laboratory.This lab contains high tech suits and gadgets that Max and his friends use to take on villains threatening the safety of Neo Kyoto™.  From here, a superhero team is formed fighting monsters large enough to crush skyscrapers and small enough to inhabit the realm of cyberspace!

THE TIMELINE    Shiba Squad™ was originally created by award winning artist, Vic Guiza.  Vic, the original Creativologist, has been working with illustration and animation for over 33 years. He has worked in marketing campaigns, animation, and on comic books with global companies and iconic brands from 16 countries including: The Simpsons, Disney, Marvel Comics, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Kellogg ́s and Frito-Lay, among others.                              Vic’s experience is inspiring, but he has never had the chance to venture into his own independent comic book project.  Shiba Squad™ The Comic book series is this chance for Vic.He conceptualized the artwork himself beginning with simple concept sketches:                And culminating in the beautiful Concept art that represents Shiba Squad™:  Matthew breathes life into the Shiba Squad™ by writing the story.  Matthew has been writing fiction since his early 20s. He published his first fantasy-adventure novel in 2012 while he was still in college.  Since then, he has published an online cartoon series and writes and produces a new theatre play annually.      Filip loves to plan, and with over 15 years of experience in business and professional services, he was keen to bring out his creative side and help his long-time friend Jay, to ensure this story is a success.Maximus, The Real Life Shiba Inu, is the inspiration for Maximus aka Max"", our Hero in Shiba Squad™- The Comic Book Series.   Jay is the creative visionary of the team.  With over 20 years of award winning experience building brands, Jay has assembled a world class team of Creativologists which has put together an impressive purpose-driven vision for Shiba Squad™. Jay and Vic have known each other for 13 years.  Jay, an avid lover of Shiba Inu dogs, wanted to produce a story about Shiba’s and his own dog Maximus, and Vic was finally ready to start his own comic book project, creating the concept for the story of Shiba Squad.  Together they brought Matthew on board as a writer and Filip to assist with the planning. Creativology Studios was formed as a result, and Shiba Squad™ is the team’s first project together.  Each member brings something different to the team, and all are experienced professionals. Our values are based on the principles of integrity, passion, hard-work and humor.THE MESSAGEThis team came together under the shared ambition of creating purpose driven content that is also fun and adorable.  The comic book market is oversaturated with serious, edgy comics.Shiba Squad™ takes its own approach.  It deals with issues that speak to all children, issues like self-esteem, weight, bullying, and diversity, but in an informative, responsible way. These issues are framed within a lighthearted and fun story! We are inspired by the comics and cartoons of our childhood and hope that you get that nostalgic feeling from just looking at Vic's art! Our mission is to create a world-class comic book (and eventually animated cartoon series) that captures the imagination of children, daring them to achieve their dreams, challenge their fears, and to fight against injustice, while always staying loyal to their friends and having fun together.THE CAMPAIGNThe immediate priority is completing the first issue of Shiba Squad™.  The story line has been written and initial art concept for the first issue has already been created. Hitting our goal of $25,000 CAD, we will have the funds to finish, print and distribute Issue #1 of Shiba Squad™.We have big ambitions for Max and the Shiba Squad™.  We would like to make more comics. 2 more future issues have already been written and we have plans for an extended story arc spanning multiple comic books. Beyond the comics, we would like to create a pilot for an animated cartoon series for Shiba Squad™!  We also have plans for a card game inspired by the Shiba Squad™ series.  These visions, however, are secondary to the immediate goals of producing the first issue. Our story finds our young hero, Maximus (a.k.a Max) living comfortably in Neo Kyoto.  His world of school and friends is about to be turned upside down forever!                   Cloud
               In Issue #1 we are introduced briefly to Max's best friend, Cloud. A technical wizard, we will soon find out how Cloud's technical prowess and teamwork aids Max's understanding of Dr. Z's secret laboratory and mysterious technology. 
The SquadBest Friends!  In Issue #1 we are introduced to Max's fellow Shiba Friends.  Over the course of the next few issues we will learn more about each character, how they join the Shiba Squad and what mysteries are unlocked in their individual exo-suits.              The Twins  - Thunder.......          ..and Lightning          Hawk!                 Prism             Jazz           Dr. ZWho is Dr. Z?  Why did he abandon his laboratory filled with magical technology that appears to be from a different dimension? What powers his laboratory? Why did he build these exo-suits so long ago?         The Villains   VincentIn Issue #1, you will be introduced to Vincent, a roguish cat in Neo Kyoto and his secretive family.  Vincent stumbles upon some unknown artifacts with mysterious energy.  How will this plot effect Neo Kyoto, only time well tell!     
CockroachzillaIn Issue #1 of Shiba Squad, we will also explore the emergence of the Giant Insect known as Cockroachzilla.  What are his reasons for attacking Neo Kyoto?  How will Max stop him?  And how did Cockroachzilla get so darn big?       The Shibatech Maximus and the Shiba Squad™ will be uncovering world changing tech that adapts to their physiology as well as intellect.  Dr. Z left a laboratory of unknown origin and mythical power sources that may ultimately shed some light on basic string theory frameworks. Say What?                   Neo Kyoto In Shiba Squad™ - The Comic Book Series you will get to explore the sprawling technological marvel known as Neo Kyoto!

They shape who we are and give us the opportunity to enhance our natural bodies. Sometimes, though, it seems our natural bodies may be better off left alone. When left in the hands of well meaning scientists, the decisions concerning when to stop pushing the limits of biotechnology can waver, with fatal side effects.  Lucid Technologies, a leading firm meant to design some of the latest and greatest technological pieces for human use, had a plan to revolutionize mankind. They were to launch an inter-brainstem implant, known as the SEED Implant, that would connect smart devices directly to their human users and make it easier than ever to monitor health, collect information, and retain data and memories. As something that could forever alter the course of humanity, the general population of the world waited with baited breath to see the outcome and get their hands on this incredible, revolutionary piece of tech.  Sometimes, though, things are not what they seem. Following a well-planned bioterrorist measure, the SEED Implant turned on its users, resulting in a sudden, painful event that destroyed the brains of millions of users worldwide in mere seconds. The tainted Implant then reactivated the brain, resulting in flesh hungry, insatiable undead monsters rising from what was once normal humans. These creatures attacked those without the implant, tearing them apart. The few survivors were then left behind to pick up the pieces and fight to remain alive despite the mass of semi-undead waiting around every corner.  Will anyone be able to survive this man made apocalypse or is humanity doomed to die at the hands of their own creation? As an emerging entity, Nukem Comics is a collaborative effort looking to create interesting comic serieses featuring fresh, new ideas. We started as a group of three friends just spinning ideas and dreaming of creating and now have gained footing and traction to work towards our ultimate goal of producing the kind of comics you can spend hours flipping through on your bedroom floor. Brothers George and Ron Dagan paired up with their longtime friend Randy Amoroso to begin this creative process. The trio aspire to produce something truly special, starting with their flagship piece: Intergalactic Deathmatch, a battle gauntlet story featuring gore, gross out humor, and throwback references tying together multiple genres in a new, niche style of comic creativity. Join Nukem Comics as they push forward with a new creative direction and experience the bloodlust and greed of the Overlord and his Intergalactic Deathmatch arenas as he pits his gladiators against one another in search of the galaxy’s greatest warrior! Aside from Intergalactic Deathmatch, Nukem Comics has many other projects in the works so keep your eyes peeled for other ventures that may soon appear on the production horizon!

<h2><strong>THE VAMPIRE VERSES HISTORY</strong></h2>
<p>The Vampire Verses is a vampire/horror comic that I created in 1994 and was published in 1995 by CFD productions (Formerly Cry For Dawn) and then Asylum Press in 1999 and beyond. The series was inspired by many anime series at the time including Wicked City, Demon City Shinjuku and Urotsukidōji: Legend of the Overfiend. I was also inspired by comic creators Berni Wrightson, Tim Vigil, Kelley Jones, Mike Mignola and others. I attempted to use all of these influences and create something of my own. What erupted from my hand and mind was The Vampire Verses.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1612301996/hdfahxuam6meehskovcm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>THE VAMPIRE VERSES SYNOPSIS:</strong></p>
<p>The debut issue introduces Angelika, an exotic dancer in the NYC club scene who is unwittingly turned into a creature of the night. As she tries to make sense of what she has become she learns of a bloody Vampire War that is being fought in the streets and subway tunnels of New York City. Slowly the truth unfolds as Angelika begins to realize she is a key part of an ancient scrolled prophecy known as The Vampire Verses.</p>
<p>It was difficult for me to make a living in comics in the 90s so I decided to move to film and animation and became a storyboard artist where the pay was higher and the income more stable. There I have worked on show such as: Lovecraft Country, Fantasy Island, Solar Opposites, Dreamwork’s 3Below, Bob’s Burgers, Insidious 4, Lego: Guardians of the Galaxy, Despicable Me 2, Lego Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Out, The Super Hero Squad Show, Marvel Heroes 4D, and Lego Hero Factory.</p>
<p>Now that time as passed I realize my true love is with making comics. I am seeking help from fans of comics, horror and vampires to help fund the final issues and sketchbooks of The Vampire Verses.</p>

<p>Hi, I’m Jeremy Haun.</p>
<p>Over the past twenty years, I’ve worked for almost every comic book company in the industry. During that time I’ve had the chance to work on many of my favorite characters like Batman, Batwoman, Captain America, Iron Man, and so many more.</p>
<p>As much as I love telling stories about the superheroes we all know and love, my heart is really in creating my own worlds-- telling my own stories, like The Beauty, The Realm, and The Red Mother.</p>
<p>Over the past year and a half, the pandemic changed our world. It was a tough time for us all. The comics industry went “pencils down,” leaving writers and artists without work. Projects were put on hold. Schedules changed in big ways. Plans had to change.</p>
<p>Like so many of us, that was tough for me. Both in my personal life and on a global scale, uncertainty reigned.</p>
<p>I went from an overfull schedule to having to reevaluate everything. I realized that for me, the thing that truly keeps me tethered is telling stories-- making things.</p>
<p>And that’s how HAUNTHOLOGY was born.</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628839783/sopu56050wl3q6kxbw4s.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I channeled all of the confusion, loneliness, isolation, anger, and fear I was feeling—that WE ALL were feeling—and told short horror stories that dealt with that. I made stories about nightmares, monsters, and post-apocalyptic landscapes-- over 20 in all.</p>
<p>Sitting alone in my studio, I wrote, drew, and lettered every single page of HAUNTHOLOGY. I put everything into these stories. And honestly? It’s the best thing I’ve ever made.</p>
<p>I’m proud to share this book with you. Over the past year it has been my therapy.</p>
<p>I believe that horror takes a look at the world around us and comments on it. It’s also about ghosts and madmen, but these are also personal stories filled with emotion and reflection.</p>
<p>I’m pulling out all the stops to make HAUNTHOLOGY as epic as possible.</p>
<p>The Kickstarter campaign was an incredible success, unlocking more pages, more stories and all kinds of cool variants and fun add-ons. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628840130/hfg62h55atjyymv6uepm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>HAUNTHOLOGY is a beautiful, oversized black-and-white hardcover short story comic book collection of 176 pages.</p>
<p>Every story in this collection was completely written, drawn, and lettered by me. Each step of creating these short stories was both a passion and learning experience. It was me making comics without compromise AND becoming a better storyteller along the way.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628840606/ud0kehoqksq75besyvxl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

</div></div>","Hi, I’m Jeremy Haun.
Over the past twenty years, I’ve worked for almost every comic book company in the industry. During that time I’ve had the chance to work on many of my favorite characters like Batman, Batwoman, Captain America, Iron Man, and so many more.
As much as I love telling stories about the superheroes we all know and love, my heart is really in creating my own worlds-- telling my own stories, like The Beauty, The Realm, and The Red Mother.
Over the past year and a half, the pandemic changed our world. It was a tough time for us all. The comics industry went “pencils down,” leaving writers and artists without work. Projects were put on hold. Schedules changed in big ways. Plans had to change.
Like so many of us, that was tough for me. Both in my personal life and on a global scale, uncertainty reigned.
I went from an overfull schedule to having to reevaluate everything. I realized that for me, the thing that truly keeps me tethered is telling stories-- making things.
And that’s how HAUNTHOLOGY was born.

 
I channeled all of the confusion, loneliness, isolation, anger, and fear I was feeling—that WE ALL were feeling—and told short horror stories that dealt with that. I made stories about nightmares, monsters, and post-apocalyptic landscapes-- over 20 in all.
Sitting alone in my studio, I wrote, drew, and lettered every single page of HAUNTHOLOGY. I put everything into these stories. And honestly? It’s the best thing I’ve ever made.
I’m proud to share this book with you. Over the past year it has been my therapy.
I believe that horror takes a look at the world around us and comments on it. It’s also about ghosts and madmen, but these are also personal stories filled with emotion and reflection.
I’m pulling out all the stops to make HAUNTHOLOGY as epic as possible.
The Kickstarter campaign was an incredible success, unlocking more pages, more stories and all kinds of cool variants and fun add-ons. 
 

 
HAUNTHOLOGY is a beautiful, oversized black-and-white hardcover short story comic book collection of 176 pages.
Every story in this collection was completely written, drawn, and lettered by me. Each step of creating these short stories was both a passion and learning experience. It was me making comics without compromise AND becoming a better storyteller along the way.

 
HERE’S WHAT YOU’LL GET
A 176 page oversized HARDCOVER (8.123” x 11.74"") with wood-free paper interior pages. 
23 1-15 page original short stories—nearly 100 pages in all. 
Over 40 pages of behind the scenes bonus features, including layouts, scripts, designs, commentary, and more!
Includes a sewn in ribbon bookmark and spot gloss.

 


 
We've also got 2 Variant Covers to choose from as well as some special editions like the Slipcase Edition and Leather Edition (Limited to 200).

The ANCIENT TOME Variant Cover
 

The NOIR Variant Cover
 

Slipcase Edition
 

Limited Leather Edition
 
IT’S FINISHED!
HAUNTHOLOGY is finished! That’s right. Finished. There’s no waiting for this to be written, drawn, and lettered. All the work is done.
With the exception of minor design elements, completion of bonus material, and the addition of any extra short stories or unlocked pages added during this campaign, HAUNTHOLOGY is ready to go.
Here’s a preview of the finished pages:

Risks and challenges
As of the start of this project, I will have almost all story and design content finished and ready to go. Another thing that will help immensely on this project is that since we've done this before, we know what to expect on fulfillment and have a much better idea of the amount of work and time needed! 
While we strive to make sure that everything is as close to our prototypes and mockups as possible, there may be some differences in the actual product. Please keep in mind that many of the items in this campaign are hand-made so slight variations between individual products is expected. 
Due to differences in computer colors, actual items may vary in color from what you see on your screen. 
There is always the possibility of unforeseen events causing delays (I've learned to just roll with it over the past year... I think we all have.) but I will be updating Backers with any delays in the unlikely event that they should arise.

<h3>Help Me Publish My Nemo 3,000 Comic Book!</h3>
<p>I'm @theauthorbot on Instagram, and I've been drawing comics for years. My new project is a mashup: I want to combine the whimsical, ornate storytelling of Winsor McCay's Little Nemo in Slumberland with the grungy, dystopian world-building of 90s comics like Sleepwalker, Batman Beyond and Spider-Man 2099. If you back my IndieGoGo, you get ""behind the scenes"" access to my creative process, where you can watch me go through the steps of writing, drawing, marketing and finally publishing the first issue of Nemo 3,000!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Cartooning Is Not My Day Job</h3>
<p>I love comics, and I've been drawing them as a hobby for as long as I can remember! Since my baby was born last year, I haven't had as much time to work on this stuff as I used to, so I have to make every project count. Many of my comics are free to read on Instagram, and I've built a small but devoted following there who enjoy my offbeat, surreal brand of storytelling. Many of these readers have asked when I would publish an actual, physical comic book that they could buy and hold in their hands. Well, today is the day! I'm going to use the funds from this IndieGoGo campaign to publish a comic book that I can then sell copies of.  </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Backers at the $2 and up level will get email or Instagram updates on how the book is coming along.</p>
<p>Backers at the $5 level and up will get access to an exclusive Instagram page, where I will post EXCLUSIVE photos, videos, and full pages as I complete them. This will really be an immersive ""behind the scenes"" experience, where you can see not just how I make the comic book, but my marketing strategies, the hurdles I face, how I deal with publishing, etc. I haven't done a campaign like this before, so if you're interested in how self-publishing a comic book works, you can join at this level and learn right along with me!</p>
<p>Backers at the $10 level will get the previous benefits, as well as a digital copy of Nemo 3,000 #1 when it is completed!</p>
<p>Backers at the $15 level will get a physical copy of the comic book shipped to them when it's completed, as well as a digital copy and all previous benefits.</p>
<p>Backers at the $60 level will get a piece of original art from the comic book shipped to them, in addition to all other benefits! (Limited to 12 backers)</p>
<h3>What The Book Will Look Like</h3>
<p>The book will be 24 pages, plus cover. I color my pages traditionally, rather than digitally: some pages may be in black and white or partial color, for stylistic purposes. Approximately four of these pages will be reimaginings of some of McCay's original strips, and the other pages will be a more modern type of comic book storytelling. Check out my work at <a href=""http://www.instagram.com/theauthorbot"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.instagram.com/theauthorbot</a> to see more examples of my cartooning style!</p>

If you back my IndieGoGo, you get ""behind the scenes"" access to my creative process, where you can watch me go through the steps of writing, drawing, marketing and finally publishing the first issue of Nemo 3,000!

Cartooning Is Not My Day Job
I love comics, and I've been drawing them as a hobby for as long as I can remember! Since my baby was born last year, I haven't had as much time to work on this stuff as I used to, so I have to make every project count. Many of my comics are free to read on Instagram, and I've built a small but devoted following there who enjoy my offbeat, surreal brand of storytelling. Many of these readers have asked when I would publish an actual, physical comic book that they could buy and hold in their hands. Well, today is the day! I'm going to use the funds from this IndieGoGo campaign to publish a comic book that I can then sell copies of.  
What You Get
Backers at the $2 and up level will get email or Instagram updates on how the book is coming along.
Backers at the $5 level and up will get access to an exclusive Instagram page, where I will post EXCLUSIVE photos, videos, and full pages as I complete them. This will really be an immersive ""behind the scenes"" experience, where you can see not just how I make the comic book, but my marketing strategies, the hurdles I face, how I deal with publishing, etc. I haven't done a campaign like this before, so if you're interested in how self-publishing a comic book works, you can join at this level and learn right along with me!
Backers at the $10 level will get the previous benefits, as well as a digital copy of Nemo 3,000 #1 when it is completed!
Backers at the $15 level will get a physical copy of the comic book shipped to them when it's completed, as well as a digital copy and all previous benefits.
Backers at the $60 level will get a piece of original art from the comic book shipped to them, in addition to all other benefits! (Limited to 12 backers)
What The Book Will Look Like
The book will be 24 pages, plus cover. I color my pages traditionally, rather than digitally: some pages may be in black and white or partial color, for stylistic purposes. Approximately four of these pages will be reimaginings of some of McCay's original strips, and the other pages will be a more modern type of comic book storytelling.

Some things we are planning to sell are character posters, key chains, button pins, bookmarks, post cards, earrings, yarn dolls and lots more! <br/><br/></p>

</div></div>","Who We Are, What We Do 
Meet Allison, Zi, Jo, Mikayla, and Alice. Together we are the ""Eaves drop"" team!
We are five high school students who have a strong passion for arts and crafts. In fact, we love it so much that we are planning to share it with others in the form of selling our work at a fan convention called Anime North this year in May. Some things we are planning to sell are character posters, key chains, button pins, bookmarks, post cards, earrings, yarn dolls and lots more! 
We are offering rewards that are similar to what we are planning to sell, but they will be LIMITED EDITION in thanks to our supporters.
   What We Need  Selling at an artist alley is a complicated and costly process; things to consider include: convention badges, table rental, arts and crafts materials, display and set up and printing fees. We did our math and it averaged to around $450 dollars per person, with the rest of the money going to group investments such as purchasing a button machine and renting the table for the weekend.

<p>Naomi Deinhart is an interstellar smuggler for the pirate organization known as Swalina. She's also discovering she has a slowly budding burden of a power that causes any male in her vicinity to become annoyingly enamored, enthralled, entranced, and infatuated with her, often times getting in the way of successfully completing a mission.</p>
<p>Drawing inspiration from Star Wars, Jackie Brown, Five Ghosts, and Captain Marvel (DeConnick's run with Marvel), Muse is a pulpy and adventurous feminist space epic by Brentt Harshman (writer, Weaselmeizters), Rowel Roque (artist), Ronson Edulan (colorist), and Jake Caputo (letterer) and it needs YOUR help.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>To cut to the chase, comics are an expensive thing to make. From funding artists, colorists, and letterers to various costs that may arise, it takes a lot. This isn't hard when the project is backed by Marvel or DC or a company willing to pay for the creation, as well as pay the writer, but most indie companies and independent releases are funded by the creators themselves. <br/>
<br/>
Such is the case here.</p>
<p>I, Brentt Harshman, am funding this project. It's tough but it's something I truly believe in and it's a story I absolutely love. Something with heart and a message but something that is also just a fun journey. An escape. Unfortunately, each issue is costing me upwards of $2,000 and, as somebody who works a barely-full-time cafe job and lives in one of the most expensive cities in the world, it's stressing me out. I'm paying for what I can, living barebones, but a little help would be nice.</p>
<p>One of my other projects, Weaselmeizters, recently met a smaller IndieGoGo campaign goal of $2,000 which helped us fund barcodes and a physical release of issue 1. While nice, in retrospect I regret us only asking for that small an amount and only using those funds to pay for physical prints of one issue.</p>
<p>Taking what I learned from Weaselmeizters, I'm looking to use the funds earned through this campaign to fund the FIRST FIVE ISSUES of Muse. That's the entire first arc. That's also a lot of money.</p>
<p>$12,000</p>
<p>I know. A lot.</p>
<p>But, it's worth it and it's a story I absolutely, 100% believe in. </p>
<p>Where is that money going? Mainly, the pockets of my team members. Everyone is excited to work on this but, in the long run, this IS work and they require payment. Any good artist or designer charges for their time and the team behind me on Muse is worth every penny. <br/>
<br/>
Any remaining money, if we meet the 12,000 dollar goal, will go towards various costs that may pop up. Any remaining money after that will go towards future issues of Muse. Every single penny goes towards development. </p>
<p>But, you get something out of this as well! From personalized sketches to characters named after you to personalized short stories or being drawn in the background of a future scene, we're going to try to make it worth your every penny. I'll even throw in personalized gifts from my own apartment at a certain amount.</p>
<p>If we DON'T meet the goal, we're happy and thankful for any penny earned. Whatever is raised goes towards paying my team and getting as many pages and/or issues completed and ready for print. I will pay out of pocket for any remaining costs.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>If I was funding this out of my pocket alone, I'd be lucky to meet a bi-monthly (every other month) deadline. With your help, my team and I can crank out the first five issues and do a monthly release of them, as well as start working on issues 6-10. <br/>
<br/>
But WHY should YOU help? Well, because you're all attractive and nice and smart and cool. But also becuase it's a story you will enjoy reading with art you will enjoy consuming. It's a story that is pure fun but also has a deeper message and meaning. It's the best thing I've written and the most fun I've had as a writer and I guarrantee you will enjoy each issue.</p>
<p>With Weaselmeizters we have released a new issue every other month, issue 3 should be heading to the printers within a week or two, and it all started with a successful IndieGoGo campaign. Was it flawed? Yes. Could we have asked for more and used the money differently? Yes. Those are lessons I've learned. Those are lessons I've applied to this. </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>I know it's tough to look at your paycheck and justify spending $x.xx of your hard earned money on funding an ENTIRE arc of a comic book series. It's hard enough for direct family members to justify that, harder on friends, harder on aquaintances, and even harder on strangers who stumble upon this or click on a shared link on Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Instagram, whatever.</p>
<p>Money is hard to come by and what you spend it on is even harder to decide. And, spending it on a crowdfunding campaign is a tough decision to make, especially when it seems like a new one is popping up every single day for a new project from your favorite filmmaker or game designer or comics creator. And, to trust that money with somebody who is still relatively new to the scene and still working on making this less of a hobby and more of a career...well, I know it's a difficult decision is what I'm saying.<br/>
<br/>
But, I appreciate it. Even if you can't commit to a FIVE DOLLAR DONATION, I appreciate your reading and sharing this. Seriously.</p>
<p>I know I'm asking for a lot here and I know it's hard to see what good your five dollars will do with a goal of $12,000, but trust me when I say every penny counts and I'll make sure to reward EVERY. PENNY. EARNED.</p>
<p>As soon as the first issue is finished, I will be shipping off pitches to various independent distributors. If nobody bites, each issue will be independently produced and distributed (much like with Weaselmeizters). However, if a company DOES bite, we will work hard to make sure Muse reaches the stands and your hands every month, in a timely fashion. We will also make sure to keep you in the loop on everything Muse and everything Naomi Deinhart.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Hey, I get it. Money is hard to come by and, what little money you DO happen to come across, it should go towards bills and you. I get that. I get that not everybody has FIVE DOLLARS to spare. </p>
<p>It's perfectly fine.</p>
<p>If you can't help with funding but you still want to be of assistance, simply sharing this campaign on your FACEBOOK, TWITTER, TUMBLR, INSTAGRAM, VINE, WHATEVER is appreciated. Any way to get word out about this project. </p>

<h3><b>Intro</b></h3>
<p>Hello everybody, <b>NoOneComics</b> here!</p>
<p>First, let us welcome and thank you for checking out this page, with this campaign hopefully we'll give life to a new  On-Going series called <strong>Blood Brothers</strong> ;  an action, gore and comedy book wrapped out in all sorts of pop culture references, all for the mere sake of having fun.</p>
<p>So, go ahead and read...</p>
<h3><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472696660/qwhvebzarucsvykkeo9q.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></b></h3>
<p>Blood Brothers is an On-Going series , each issue containing the standard 22 pages of comics with occasional 6 pages back up bonus features, the book is in black and white with gray tones, and  each issue is set to have an auto conclusive adventure while leaving a cliffhanger in the end to segue into the next issue, also there is a two page fan letter/editorial column that gets inside the details of the creation of every issue and picks up little winks or hidden messages you might have missed *.</p>
<p>*<i>yeah there are hidden messages or funny details in some pages</i></p>
<p>This project has been in the works for many years so I'll let you know that the first three issues of the comic are done, with numbers four to six already written, hopefully and if you like this we are ready to release a lot of stuff in the future, with plans of TPB with issues 1 to 6 plus extras!</p>
<p>I did and interview some time ago that details that history , if you are super curious you will find that note <a href=""http://indiereader.com/2013/10/blood-brothers/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a></p>

Hello everybody, NoOneComics here!
First, let us welcome and thank you for checking out this page, with this campaign hopefully we'll give life to a new  On-Going series called Blood Brothers ;  an action, gore and comedy book wrapped out in all sorts of pop culture references, all for the mere sake of having fun.
So, go ahead and read...

Blood Brothers is an On-Going series , each issue containing the standard 22 pages of comics with occasional 6 pages back up bonus features, the book is in black and white with gray tones, and  each issue is set to have an auto conclusive adventure while leaving a cliffhanger in the end to segue into the next issue, also there is a two page fan letter/editorial column that gets inside the details of the creation of every issue and picks up little winks or hidden messages you might have missed *.
*yeah there are hidden messages or funny details in some pages
This project has been in the works for many years so I'll let you know that the first three issues of the comic are done, with numbers four to six already written, hopefully and if you like this we are ready to release a lot of stuff in the future, with plans of TPB with issues 1 to 6 plus extras!
I did and interview some time ago that details that history , if you are super curious you will find that note here

Quite simply one of the most hilarious comics you will find out there, we took the usual clichés from comic book, movies, video games, music (namely heavy metal and classic rock, of course) and put them through our filter just to make the resulting characters do bizarre stuff.
You can think of it as South Park meets Happy Tree Friends with a bit of manga plus mainstream super hero comics... is all there, you will recognize it as a true comic fan I’m sure you are,  but in an entirely different shape, that , rest assured, was created to entertain (shock) you.
This is not that PG13 Expendables movie...oh hell no!
Check out some samples below, but in case you want to know a bit more, there is a 12 page preview ready for you waiting in this tapastic location or if you prefer on this issuu location.
