This technology is not yet fully developed, leading to manufacturing failures still stuck in R&D.Quin Helmets redefine modern safety essentials, providing unobtrusive technology, rider-focussed safety, and beautiful design.   Quin Helmets have invisibly integrated bluetooth 4.0 connectivity, giving you handsfree access to the apps you are most likely to use - phone calls, music, maps navigation, intelligent personal assistant and more.  The Quin Arc Chip™ allows Quin helmets to be ever evolving. Through DFU (Device Firmware Upgrade), Quin helmets upgrade via system updates that are easily loaded by running the Quin Firmware Upgrade through the micro-USB connection.

<p>Only about 23% of single-use plastic water bottles are recycled nationally. This is a problem because it takes 450 years for a plastic water bottle to decompose in a landfill. Which means <strong>any piece of plastic you have ever used in your life time is still on this Earth - and then some.</strong></p>
<p>At the height of the water crisis, the city of Flint was using more than <strong>20 million water bottles a day </strong>to meet their daily needs. This resulted in a surplus of plastic being brought into the city. Post-use these bottles have been collected for recycling, re-processed, and resold outside of the city. Other corporations have been benefiting off of Flint's disaster. rPET is a valuable recycled material that could be used to create jobs, boost the local economy, and benefit the community who has been without clean water since April 24, 2014. </p>
<p>Genusee prioritizes the use of pre-existing materials in the supply chain over creating new ones. By redesigning the lifecycle of plastic water bottles and upcycling bottles into a product of need and purpose <strong>Genusee is able to bring the value of rPET back into Flint - where it belongs.</strong></p>

<p>Feeling a need to do something, Ali shared her experience with long-term collaborator and co-founder Jack Burns. Together, Ali and Jack began working on a design solution to address issues of plastic waste that would simultaneously create living wage jobs in Flint. They didn’t have an answer to the city’s problems. They simply knew they wanted to help.</p>
<p>Genusee was one of six companies to participate in the inaugural Elaine Gold Launch Pad program in partnership with the CFDA and the Accessories Council. During their time in the program, the team was awarded a micro-grant to further their business venture in Flint.</p>

<h2>Risks and challenges</h2>
<p>We have spent the last 2 years researching, prototyping and testing our current products and believe the risks are close to non-existent. We are working with eyewear consultants on all levels to ensure and mitigate problems as they arise. We have put our entire selves into to making this project a reality and are now reaching out to the Kickstarter community to finance our first production. We feel confident in saying that we are very capable of executing whatever it takes to run a successful campaign, and most importantly, to deliver the product on time.</p>
<p>We are excited about delivering our first products to our backers, and we will be completely engaged with our supporters during this process with full transparency. Any updates will be relayed in a timely manner, and we are open to any feedback or questions that arise along the way.</p>
<p>With your support, you won’t just be helping us to fund Genusee; you’ll be part of developing the future of Flint.</p>
<p>Forecasting Risk : Of course there can always be unforeseen matters/delays that we cannot control. But fortunately this rarely happens. If a problem comes up, our backers will be the first to know.</p>
<p>Acts of God : Events outside human control, like flash floods, tornadoes, earthquakes, or other natural disasters that could delay delivery.</p>
<p>If the information provided is not sufficient, please send you questions to the creators of the project.</p>

Our first frame style, the Roeper, is democratically designed to look great on everyone. It is available exclusively on Kickstarter as either prescription optical or sunglasses. 

Our goal is simple: do good for people and the planet using design and collaboration to be the change we want to see. 


Genusee is bringing a new manufacturing legacy to the city of Flint by creating jobs; turning the surplus of plastic waste caused by the man-made water crisis into closed loop eyewear.


It is not just about being able to recycle materials. We want to upcycle single use plastic into products that have more value and purpose. We are able to upcycle 15 water bottles with every purchase.


 
We will be launching with our first style, the Roeper. The original Made in Flint eyewear. 
Democratically designed to fit a variety of face shapes. The Roeper looks great as either prescription eyeglasses or sunglasses. 
Offered in two frame colors: Crystal Fog & Classic Black.

 
Every purchase includes a plano or prescription single-vision polycarbonate lens or CR-39 tinted sun lens or readers.
All lenses are anti-reflective and UV protective. 
Additionally we will be able to fulfill requests for high-index, blue filter, prescription sun, and progressive lenses at a competitive additional cost. 

The Roeper frame style was designed to fit the median range of face shapes and sizes. If you are wondering if they will fit you, please compare the measurements to those of some of your other favorite eyewear. 


If we reach our $100,000 stretch goal, all of our backers will automatically receive our multi-use case. 
The case is also made from food-grade rPET and has a water tight seal. So you can say ""No"" to single-use water bottles and to-go cups. Use the Genusee Multi-Use Case to store your eyeglasses, as a water bottle, or container for your favorite green juice on-the-go. It is our way of trying to help you towards living a zero-waste life.

Over 41% of the population lives below the poverty line - earning less than $12,082 annually. For those who are employed, 40% of that working population makes less than $10/hr.

Eyeglasses can be manufactured with a basic understanding of tools and on-the-job skills training. By bringing a new manufacturing legacy to the city of Flint, and creating jobs that anyone can be trained to do - we will put people back to work by retraining and employing them in new skills and crafts.

We are excited about delivering our first products to our backers, and we will be completely engaged with our supporters during this process with full transparency. Any updates will be relayed in a timely manner, and we are open to any feedback or questions that arise along the way.
With your support, you won’t just be helping us to fund Genusee; you’ll be part of developing the future of Flint.
Forecasting Risk : Of course there can always be unforeseen matters/delays that we cannot control. But fortunately this rarely happens. If a problem comes up, our backers will be the first to know.
Acts of God : Events outside human control, like flash floods, tornadoes, earthquakes, or other natural disasters that could delay delivery.
If the information provided is not sufficient, please send you questions to the creators of the project.

<h3>National American Miss Pre-Teen Pageant National's</h3>
Hi, My name is Riley and I am a 10 year old with big dreams!  I am on the far right in the picture (that would be your right).  I was nominated by the National Honor Society to audition for the National American Miss North Carolina Pre-Teen pageant.  This is a NO MAKEUP, ALL NATURAL pageant.  It was held in Winston-Salem, NC...not far from Greensboro, so me and my mom went.  Not only did I get accepted to compete but I won 3rd runner up! The categories that I competed in were Formal Wear, Introduction and Interview, although I was very nervous it helped me to gain confidence and it gave me an opportunity to meet some really great friends.  An optional contest was the Casual Wear/Runway Modeling (now this was up my alley!)  I placed 2nd runner up and had a great time!</div>
<div>
<h3>I Need Your Sponsorship</h3>
Placing 3rd runner up means that I am part of the Queen's Court and I will be competing at Nationals in the National All-American Miss pageant.  This is a pageant were I proudly get to represent my city, Greensboro, NC.  The pageant is being held in Disneyland, California and the sponsorship fee is $795.00.  I also get to compete in the National Casual Wear/Runway Modeling.  The entry fee for that competition is $175.00.  The total fee is $970.00.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As my sponsor, your name will be listed in the Program Book at the National competition.  Your sponsorship will help me continue to gain self-confidence and poise.  You will be helping me realize my dream of becoming a casual wear model, but most importantly you will help me experience something that not a lot of kids my age get to experience.  I love to meet new people and my mom always tells me I have a big heart...I didn't really know what that meant until a couple of years ago...I guess she thinks I am a pretty sweet kid.  I love to help people and this pageant will give me an opportunity to get involved in several community service projects. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Anything You Can Contribute Will Help</h3>
I know sometimes people can't always give what they want.  I completely understand.  Anything you give will be much appreciated, even if it is just a word of encouragement.</div>

<div>Thank you in advance,</div>

we are Sarah and Dinah from Studio Lilesadi. We are originally from Germany but our studio is based in Rotterdam. 

We were tired of boring cutting boards and have designed graphical eye-catchers made of wood for your kitchen and living room.
The cutting boards come in a form of a bear and mountain. They can be used as cutting board, bread board, cheese or cake plate, or hot plate. They bring fun in your home and are as well very decorative.  

The clothes hook makes your wall in the entry, sleeping room or kitchen look stunning and can be used to hang your clothes, jackets or even jewelry.We have produced a limited edition together with two small Dutch wood working companies. As a material we chose high quality steamed beech wood. To achieve the bear and the mountain shapes the wood goes through a lot of hands. The wood needs to be CNC milled and then at a later stage the graphic lines have to be burned into the wood in a really detailed process. After this they need to be polished and oiled by hand. The manufacturer can only offer more economic production methods starting from 150 pieces on. Support our project and help us reach an amount of 5.000 Euro. That allows us to purchase a bigger volume of beech wood for a good price to be able to produce 150 pieces of the bread boards and racks

Almost everything is imported here, quite common issue in Africa, and availability of good materials and technical products is really scarce. Costs are also very high, due to high customs duties, and thanks to a massive corruption. <br/></p><p>What we noticed, even in the largest companies we visited, was the lack of recent machineries, equipments and technology. <br/></p><p>Almost everything looks dated in the late seventies. Mostly old supplies from the Sovietic support in the eighties, or French.</p><p>We've got in touch with some local institutions, especially with the Universities. And we decided we could and should do something in the field of Education. <br/></p><p>So far, we discussed some ideas with the Universities, especially with the management of the University of Architecture in Bamako, and launched our project named <b>""Laboratoire pour l'Afrique""</b>. A three phases project which final ambitious goal is a <b>Technological Campus</b> to support the local Universities. <br/><br/><b>This campaign serves the first step of the project</b>, and the SpaceOne technology has been purposely developed for the machines we aim to donate to the local Universities. <br/></p><p><b>With your help, </b>we will build at least two large size 3D Printers equipped with the SpaceOne ATS-1 technology, and several extruders/tools, especially clay and cement mix extruders, due to the nature of the faculties. </p><p>These machines will be of great support to teach the Malian students the modern technologies and their application to the engineering, hydraulics, architecture and design.</p><p>We don't really need to guide them in their growth. Give them the necessary information and the proper technology, and they will develop their own projects. <br/>This is what they actually need. <br/></p><p>By the way, they're already helping all of us, because if it was not for this project we would hardly have developed this innovative technology.</p><p><b><i>It might be one of the first times ever that such an innovative technology [for the 3D Printing] has been developed in Africa.  </i></b>And we're pretty proud of this fact.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>As you can see, we have chosen the flexible-funding formula, and we did for a couple of reasons:</p><ul>
<li>Our main and original goal is to fund the project <strong><span class=""spaceone_green"">""Laboratoire pour l'Afrique""</span></strong><span class=""spaceone_green""></span>, which is a multi-phase long term project. SpaceOne contributes to the first phase. Two more are already planned as described on our web pages. Whatever we'll raise on this campaign will help and serve as a start and a fundation for the next phases. The more we get, the better.</li>
<li>Based on 35+ years on experience in the field of Industrial Design and Product Development, we know very well how things may develop quite differently along time. We considered several aspects of this project and we simulated several possible scenario in which the campaign could develop. <br/>We did our best to cover almost every possible situation, from the most concervative to the truly optimistic one. <br/>To be ready to fullfill our promise in any case.</li>
<li>We're pretty happy to say that we have a full backup plan and we will be able to delivery the perks even if the project will not be fully funded.</li>
<li>To delivery the first two printers to the Bamako Universities - as per our first goal in the Laboratoire pour l'Afrique project - we will need approximately 35,000.00 USD, we can achieve this in a relatively simple way, without special tooling.</li>
<li>To achieve the desired quality, consistency and economy, we have to go on a Mass Production scale, and we need molding tools as well as custom assembly tools. We need to reach at least 125,000.00 USD to get to this point.</li>

This is not an actual 3D Printing device. The SpaceOne ATS-1 doesn't incorporate any 3D Printing technology in itself. SpaceOne ATS-1 may look like a small spaceship or, like a Hi-Tech donut with the hole in the middle. That hole in the middle is the core of the system, because it's where the 3D Printing technology will seat.The innovation sitting in that hole consists in the possibility to switch non only between different materials but also different technologies, while the machine is working, without interrupting the process, automatically managed by the program, even in the absence of the operator, unattended, overnight. 
SpaceOne ATS-1 will save you a lot of money and also space in your workshop. 
Less machines = a smaller setup footprint  is required
Less machines = less maintenance issues
Less machines = less power consumption
Less machines = a much easier learning curve

Less machines = A great SAVING

SpaceOne ATS-1 = Higher flexibility and performance than multiple machines.

Add SpaceOne ATS-1 to your new or existing machine and start thinking at it as a totally new tool, not just like an improvement to your standard technology.

SpaceOne Automatic Technology Switching allow you to store multiple tools and use them at will, in the same working session, automatically driven by the program, eventually unassisted. 

Tools do not need to be homogeneous to each other. Be creative and mix any tool you desire and which will add a new spark to your creations.
Refine your jobs while still in the original setup. Less moving means more accuracy and less chance to do mistakes.Also it will improve productivity, a lot !

This lead to a number of immediate and recognizable advantages:

Switch multiple materials, colors, thickness and densities, requiring separate nozzles to work.


Provide backup nozzles, already loaded with the material and, in case of failure, the machine will automatically switch the device, without compromising the job.

Switch between totally different technologies, without requiring any modification to the printer, nor a special setup. Actually, the printer will automatically unload the dismissed tool and will load the required one, updating the software setup, and checking the functionality of the system. Ready for a new job. From FDM ABS to Ceramic Printing in a matter of seconds.
Do jobs which would do almost impossible to do with existing technologies alone.


Save a considerable amount of Money and Space. By equipping a single machine with the SpaceOne ATS-1 system, you'll have all the benefit of multiple machines in the footprint of a single one. 
 The tool-holder inner diameter is 80mm to fit the commonly available 2.2KW water cooled spindle motor. Three ring adapters are provided as standard, to fit smaller size tools with diameters of 70, 60 and 50mm.2D drawings and 3D models are included in the accompanying DVD, together with detailed instructions, allowing you to machine your custom rings.You will have an almost unlimited number of tools available on your machine, up to 5 per single session as standard, however it will be possible to setup larger racks with more available slots if the machine size allows. You can fit your 3D machine with the following tools, and more:

Multiple FDM extruders (to print multi-color, multi-material, multi-size)

Plastic Pellet Extruders, single or double auger, not limited to filament availability.

Hot and Cold Paste Extruders for food printing, from chocolate to dougths, cream, decoration, glazing.


Commercial and Custom Paste Extruders for Ceramic and Porcelain printing. 

Concrete Mix Extruders for Contour Crafting applications.
Wax extruders for jewelery and metal casting
Polymer Clay extruders, for kids and serious model makers, artists, prop makers.


3D Digitizers (Laser, Optical, Sonic, Touch Probes)


Cutting Wheels for Contour Cutting glass, leather, cardboard, film, paper...


Up to 25W compact Lasers for Engraving and Cutting.


Motor Spindles for CNC milling, drilling and trimming.


Marking devices.


Vacuum cups for Pick & Place applications.


Anything else you may like to use, if it fits the 80mm diameter ring. 

You don't have to be concerned about different tool heights. The SpaceOne ATS-1 system managing software will allow you to calibrate each tool and to store the calibration data in the software memory. Calibrate one, use them all together at your will, no more headaches. Almost all the 3D Printing and CNC manufacturing technologies share one common element: they all rely on a motion system to work. It could be a traditional 3 Axis or Multi-Axis Cartesian system, it could be a modern Delta Robot or Stewart Platform, but it might also be a robotic arm. It doesn't matter, which one. If you need different technologies, most of the time it means you need more machines or complicate setup modifications. Are You concerened about the minimum size of the machine?Do not be worried. The SpaceOne ATS-1 can fit almost any size. Of course this model has been designed to suite a slightly larger range of machines, sporting bigger and heavier tools. However, as clearly depicted in the figure above, a small machine with a footprint of only 600x600mm (only 50% larger than the smaller Rep-Rap printers on the market) will convenientely fit the SpaceOne and 3 ATS-1 rack slots. And it will offer a much larger building envelope than available on those ""little"" machines. However, we're already working on a feasible solution for those ""little ones"" which happen to be just a bit too smal for the ATS-1. Coming soon.  SpaceOne protect your Investment when you need to grow larger.
Because SpaceOne ATS-1 is not a closed system. It's not custom tailored on a specific machine or configuration. SpaceOne ATS-1 will be the core of your 3D Printing/Fabbing system. And it wil stay with you forever, protecting your valuable investment in money, time and knowledge. You'll never need to learn a new procedure. As long as your needs expand and grow, you'll only need a larger frame, new guides and motors (eventually), and you're done. All your existing tools will come along, with SpaceOne, and you can add more, specifically tailored for the new requirements, but you're not losing your old ones. You'll be able to move from a traditional 3-axis machine to a robotic arm or to a Delta platform and even to a 6DOF Stewart platform. SpaceOne will always be there.SpaceOne ATS-1 is modular and fits the standard 80x40 aluminum extruded profiles. Our professional Experience
We are a small group of professionals who have been working together for almost a couple of decades. Our current localization, spread over Europe, Middle East, Asia and Africa has been highly beneficial to this project.Actually, if two of us didn't have the chance to move to Mali on a mid term consultancy basis, and to get in touch with the wonderful People of this extremely poor Country, this project might not even been conceived. Our proven capability to work together at distance and to remotely manage complex projects involving several time-zones will guarantee the success of the project and the timely delivery of the perks.A proven experience in field.
With more than 35 years of professional experience in the field of Industrial and Product Design, and a strong knowledge about most of the current manufacturing techniques, we can feel pretty comfortable when it's matter of designing and launching a new product. We have been involved in every single aspect of the product design and development, including the engineering and industrialization process, for several products, both for industrial application and for the consumer and IT market. Our R&D team in Italy comes from approx. 20 years of professional experience in the field of Power Electronics, TV manufacturing and small robotics. Together, we have been involved on several complex projects, which also included overseas tool development and product manufacturing. We have acquired a good expertise in the management of suppliers and goods on the Asian market.We transferred this knowledge to this project as well. And now, please Help us to support the project ""Laboratoire pour l'Afrique""Help to support the development of Mali
We arrived in Mali on August 1st 2013, as consultants for a project, coming from several years living in Dubai (UAE), quite an impact. However, what caught us almost immediately was not the extreme poverty of this Country, considered by UN one of the poorest Countries in the World and just coming out from a period of tension, insurgencies and war. No, the most impacting aspect of this Country were the People. They're really some of the nicest souls we ever met. Always smiling, Malians are very social and love to entertain. Despite their extreme poverty, they're also highly dignitous and respectful. Bamako, the Capital, is quite a chaotic City of approx. two millions. And with the most chaotic and polluted traffic you could imagine. No, you just can't. The Market is spread all over the town, everyone is selling something, and this happens also in the small villages. They make a living somehow.We decided we had to do something to help, if possible. And it was immediately clear that we didn't want to do anything similar to what most of the ONG do. Charity.Charity doesn't solve the problems of this area of the world, it's not what they need, even if beggars are almost everywhere and all ages, yet again very dignitous and respectful. Development is what this Country needs. We were here for professional reasons and we soon encountered some huge problems. Almost everything is imported here, quite common issue in Africa, and availability of good materials and technical products is really scarce. Costs are also very high, due to high customs duties, and thanks to a massive corruption. What we noticed, even in the largest companies we visited, was the lack of recent machineries, equipments and technology. Almost everything looks dated in the late seventies. Mostly old supplies from the Sovietic support in the eighties, or French.We've got in touch with some local institutions, especially with the Universities. And we decided we could and should do something in the field of Education. So far, we discussed some ideas with the Universities, especially with the management of the University of Architecture in Bamako, and launched our project named ""Laboratoire pour l'Afrique"". A three phases project which final ambitious goal is a Technological Campus to support the local Universities. This campaign serves the first step of the project, and the SpaceOne technology has been purposely developed for the machines we aim to donate to the local Universities. With your help, we will build at least two large size 3D Printers equipped with the SpaceOne ATS-1 technology, and several extruders/tools, especially clay and cement mix extruders, due to the nature of the faculties. These machines will be of great support to teach the Malian students the modern technologies and their application to the engineering, hydraulics, architecture and design.We don't really need to guide them in their growth. Give them the necessary information and the proper technology, and they will develop their own projects. This is what they actually need. By the way, they're already helping all of us, because if it was not for this project we would hardly have developed this innovative technology.It might be one of the first times ever that such an innovative technology [for the 3D Printing] has been developed in Africa.  And we're pretty proud of this fact.What We Need & What You GetAs you can see, we have chosen the flexible-funding formula, and we did for a couple of reasons:
Our main and original goal is to fund the project ""Laboratoire pour l'Afrique"", which is a multi-phase long term project. SpaceOne contributes to the first phase. Two more are already planned as described on our web pages. Whatever we'll raise on this campaign will help and serve as a start and a fundation for the next phases. The more we get, the better.
Based on 35+ years on experience in the field of Industrial Design and Product Development, we know very well how things may develop quite differently along time. We considered several aspects of this project and we simulated several possible scenario in which the campaign could develop. We did our best to cover almost every possible situation, from the most concervative to the truly optimistic one. To be ready to fullfill our promise in any case.
We're pretty happy to say that we have a full backup plan and we will be able to delivery the perks even if the project will not be fully funded.
To delivery the first two printers to the Bamako Universities - as per our first goal in the Laboratoire pour l'Afrique project - we will need approximately 35,000.00 USD, we can achieve this in a relatively simple way, without special tooling.
To achieve the desired quality, consistency and economy, we have to go on a Mass Production scale, and we need molding tools as well as custom assembly tools. We need to reach at least 125,000.00 USD to get to this point.

As previously stated, we carefully evaluated all possible scenarios, including the less exciting one, missing the target. We designed the project in order to be responsive, so far we will be able to fulfill all the requests, only it will probably take longer and there will be no frills. If the Mass Production target will not reached, we will not be able to use Magnesium Alloy and PA66/40% Carbon as planned, we will use Aluminum 6061 or ADC12. It will ensure the same quality, but a longer process, and more expensive to us. The products will be slightly heavier, of course. Also, we will not be able to supply the product in the nice, polished packaging we've designed. Standard shipping packaging will be used instead. Still safe but not so appealing. We will not be able to ensure the printing of the book. We won't say no at the present time, we're concerned that it could be difficulto to do it.And, of course, we will have much less resources to fund the ""Laboratoire pour l'Afrique"" as we planned, which would make us pretty sad.",23.0,0,"1 Campaign

As a matter of fact, as I think back to my childhood days, I can remember word from word what my Grandmother use to tell me. She used to say ""Be Great, it was a mindset she embedded in me as long as I was determined and worked hard, I could be anything I wanted to be in life. See, my Grandmother has always been a thoughtful and giving person. She always believed in giving back to the community and has always given me her support, no matter what crazy Idea I came up with . My Grandmother has always been the heart &amp; soul to my family. Unfortunately, she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012 and survived it for a year or so. While my grandmother was sick I created Thoughtful Minds and I launched 2 tshirts and 1 snapback that I sold online that was successful also have received so much support from family, friends and now I need your help to expand the line and help launch my fall collection with more product and into the hands of people all around the world. </p><p> What drives me as a young designer is my grandmother words of wisdom, encouragement that she gave to me and her thoughtful ways to others. I want my designs not only to be stylish but to inspire individuals that they can do anything they put their mind to and they can BE GREAT in their own way. </p><p> Eventually the cancer spread thought out the rest of my grandmother body. In August of 2013 my grandmother passed away, and in the honor of my Grandmother I want my fall collection to be in the memory of her. In addition to also build a foundation that will always honor my Grandmother and her belief in me and my dreams.</p><p><b>MISSION STATEMENT</b></p><p>We at Thoughtful Minds are looking to make an unforgettable statement.

As a matter of fact, as I think back to my childhood days, I can remember word from word what my Grandmother use to tell me. She used to say ""Be Great, it was a mindset she embedded in me as long as I was determined and worked hard, I could be anything I wanted to be in life. See, my Grandmother has always been a thoughtful and giving person. She always believed in giving back to the community and has always given me her support, no matter what crazy Idea I came up with . My Grandmother has always been the heart & soul to my family. Unfortunately, she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012 and survived it for a year or so. While my grandmother was sick I created Thoughtful Minds and I launched 2 tshirts and 1 snapback that I sold online that was successful also have received so much support from family, friends and now I need your help to expand the line and help launch my fall collection with more product and into the hands of people all around the world.  What drives me as a young designer is my grandmother words of wisdom, encouragement that she gave to me and her thoughtful ways to others. I want my designs not only to be stylish but to inspire individuals that they can do anything they put their mind to and they can BE GREAT in their own way.  Eventually the cancer spread thought out the rest of my grandmother body. In August of 2013 my grandmother passed away, and in the honor of my Grandmother I want my fall collection to be in the memory of her. In addition to also build a foundation that will always honor my Grandmother and her belief in me and my dreams.MISSION STATEMENTWe at Thoughtful Minds are looking to make an unforgettable statement.

<p>The <strong><em>SMART</em></strong> platform is lightweight and incorporates a microprocessor integrated with LifeBEAM’s advanced algorithm, a state-of-the-art optical physiological sensor, accelerometer, and full wireless communication capabilities.</p>
<p>We Need Your Help!</p>
<p>While we have experience in the Aerospace industry, this is our first consumer facing product, and we need your help to make it a success!</p>
<h2>The <em>SMART</em> Solution</h2>
<p>We integrated our unique sensor &amp; algorithms, originally developed for fighter pilots &amp; astronauts, into the Lazer’s GENESIS helmet resulting in the <strong><em>SMART</em></strong> – a cycling helmet that provides highly accurate, real time measurements of heart rate under normal as well as extreme physiological conditions without the problems inherent to chest straps. <br/>The information gathered by the <strong><em>SMART</em></strong> appears in real time on your mobile phone, sport watch or cycling computer via ANT+ or Bluetooth.</p>
<p>Our sensing technology was built for intense activities in extreme environments and demonstrated highly accurate results compared to the most reliable ECG chest belts in market. It is, therefore, suitable for high performance athletes in any cycling environment.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Heart-Rate Monitoring</span></h3>
<p>Cyclists who want to monitor and improve their performance cannot ignore their heart rate. Personal heart-rate provides a window to individual's overall fitness.</p>
<p>Heart rate is commonly monitored using chest straps. Fitness watches, cycling computers &amp; smartphones - all provide a platform that can communicate with a chest strap and display heart rate.</p>
<p>But what if you hate wearing that strap around your chest for hours? Straps can chafe, irritate, lose contact and migrate. We now offer the perfect solution - the <strong><em>SMART</em></strong>.</p>

<h3>Now you can use this technology during cycling!</h3>
<p><em>What could be simpler than putting on your <strong>SMART</strong> cycling helmet integrated with our small and almost invisible sensor, and continuously monitoring your heart rate?!</em></p>
<h3><strong> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/680921/pictures/original/20130227061958-Bike.Still017.jpg?1361974796"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></h3>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">Technology - main features &amp; benefits</strong></p>
<p>LifeBEAM's core sensing technology is based on state of the art non-invasive optical methods, using miniature components that allow unobtrusive &amp; continuous physiological monitoring. These unique sensing methods enable a high-accuracy measurement of various physiological parameters.</p>
<p>LifeBEAM's main technological expertise creates applicative solutions that are significantly insensitive to motion artifacts and thus can be used in dynamic environments and under extreme conditions. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""How does it work?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/675995/pictures/full/20130224110628-LifeBeam_sketch_s2.jpg?1361732790"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>So what’s so cool about <em>SMART</em>?</h3>
<p><strong><em>SMART</em></strong> uses electro-optical technology to continuously measure your heart-rate.</p>
<p>The optical sensor is placed on the helmet’s front, gently touching your forehead. The sensor samples the blood pulse in a high frequency and transmits a raw signal to the processing unit, which is placed in the helmet’s back.</p>
<p><img alt=""LifeBEAM's sensor"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/675994/pictures/full/20130224110603-LifeBeam_sketch_s1.jpg?1361732766"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The processing unit filters the signal from motion artifacts and, using the communication module, wirelessly transmits the cleansed pulse to your display device in real-time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/677489/pictures/full/20130225095511-JointHelmet2.jpg?1361814915"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>We plan to continue developing the <strong><em>SMART</em></strong>, keeping it up to date with the ever-changing technologies, in order to provide the best and most cutting-edge product for our customers.</p>
<p>Integrating a processing unit and wireless communication capabilities opens the door for various additional sensors &amp; features that will be processed in the helmet and transmitted wirelessly to any place!</p>
<p>A few examples for some optional future implementations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Additional Functions: Stand-alone device, Crash detection, Bicycle locator, integration with Cycling training apps for additional parameters and more!</li>
<li>Advanced display capabilities: head up display capabilities just like in fighter pilots helmets!</li>
<li>Additional Sensors: GPS, SIM, Logger and more!</li>
<li>Sound feedback features.</li>
</ul><p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Prototyping process</strong></h2>
<p>After successfully monitoring a pilot's vitals, LifeBEAM wanted to expand and reach new horizons. </p>
<p>On one of their weekend rides, two engineers from our team modified our technology and integrated it into their cycling helmets. </p>
<p>Excited by the outcome and the idea of combining our technology with their love of cycling, they convinced the team to pursue their dream.</p>
<p>On the following 6 months, the R&amp;D team worked together to amend the algorithms to suit the cycling environment and develop a kit that could be integrated into a professional cycling helmet while prolonging the battery life, maximizing the duration between charges, and without adding unnecessary weight.</p>

<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">FAQ</strong></p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">How does your technology work?</span></h3>
<p>LifeBEAM's sensing platform and algorithms can accurately measure heart-rate in a non-invasive, miniature and unobtrusive manner. The unique mechanical solution helps to provide an improved raw signal. A robust &amp; unique multi-layer method that calculates the heart-rate from pulse signals by implementing two types of reference sensors in our sensing platform: 3D accelerometer and an optic reference that monitor motion but not pulse wave. We use both references for the reduction of motion artifacts since some artifacts are reflected in one reference, and other artifacts are reflected in the other.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>On which devices will I be able to present the heart-rate data?</h3>
<p>By using the Bluetooth 4.0 or ANT+ Wireless Communication, the <strong><em>SMART</em></strong> can work with most Fitness Watches, Cycling Computers and Smartphones apps in the market.</p>
<p>Any display device that can accept heart-rate from an ANT+ heart rate chest strap will be able to accept heart rate data from the <strong><em>SMART</em></strong>.</p>

<h3>When will I receive my <strong><em>SMART</em></strong>?</h3>
<p>We expect to deliver the first <strong><em>SMART</em></strong> batches to our Indiegogo contributors within 4-6 months from the campaign end date.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Can I choose a color?</h3>
<p>Our intention is to provide with more than one color selection, while the number of available designs depends on the amount of support that we get in the campaign. During the campaign, we will update about this subject and the available design choices.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why can’t I use your technology on my current helmet?</h3>
<p>The sensing platform requires a unique mechanical solution in order to provide you with a continuous &amp; accurate heart-rate reading, which we embedded in Lazer’s GENESIS helmet. In the future, we may be able to provide additional designs.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why did no one else think about it before?</h3>
<p>That’s a great question… but seriously, extracting heart-rate from the forehead is extremely complicated and years of monitoring pilots &amp; astronauts, enabled us to overcome this challenge. In addition, integrating the various components into a cycling helmet without adding significant weight and without interfering with the user’s ride was extremely challenging.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What parameters will I be able to receive from my <strong><em>SMART</em></strong>?</h3>
<p>You will receive a continuous measurement of your heart-rate and any other heart-rate feature provided by the chosen display device or app. For example: Average heart-rate, Max heart-rate, etc.</p>
<p id="""">The information will be displayed in real time on all types of display devices, such as Smartphones apps, Fitness Watches and Cycling Computers.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Does the sensor work regardless of weather conditions or sweat?</h3>
<p>Yes, definitely. Our sensing platform is resistant to sweat, rain &amp; other environmental conditions.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>For how long between chargers will the battery last?</h3>
<p>The battery life is at least 15 hours of continuous usage. It will switch to idle mode if not used more than 3 minutes, in order to extend the battery life.</p>

The transaction will be registered in our databases and linked to your previous transaction.</p>
<p>Regarding customs duty - please check the policy in your country.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>When will the <strong><em>SMART</em></strong> be available for sale to the public?</h3>
<p>Only after we deliver the Indiegogo pre-orders, we will enter into an additional production process and then the <strong><em>SMART</em></strong> will be available for everyone else.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why do we need to monitor our heart-rate during cycling?</h3>
<p>During an aerobic workout, large groups of your body's muscles are used over an extended period of time in a consistent, rhythmic manner. In order to function aerobically, your muscles demand oxygen. The harder you exercise your muscles, the more oxygen they require. This oxygen is supplied to your muscles by your lungs through the bloodstream. As a result, your heart pumps faster during a workout in an effort to deliver the additional oxygen that your muscles are demanding. As you strengthen your body through exercise, you also strengthen your heart.</p>
<p>Personal heart-rate provides a window to individual's overall fitness. Measuring your heart-rate is the best and most commonly used method to gauge the effectiveness of your workout! Measuring the rate of your heart during exercise can help you determine when you're pushing your body too hard or need to push it harder to achieve the level of fitness you are seeking.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>If I have a power meter, do I need a Heart-Rate monitor?</h3>
<p>Power-meters are essential, however they demonstrate the work you're doing; your heart rate is your body's response to that work. For example: accurate heart rate monitoring can provide real time feedback whether you should continue with your workout. If you have recovered from the prior day's work out, your heart-rate will increase as you begin an interval. If your heart-rate is slow to rise and remains elevated longer than normal into your recovery period, you're probably better off saving a hard session for another day.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How do I choose between Bluetooth and ANT+?</h3>
<p>After your payment process, we will contact you and make sure we get your preferred communication method: ANT+ or Bluetooth 4.0 (BLE - Bluetooth Low Energy).</p>
<ul>
<li>If you use ANT+ device, iPhone 4 or lower version or Smartphone with built-in ANT+ then choose ANT+</li>
<li>If you use devices or smartphones with Bluetooth 4.0 (e.g. iPhone 4S or 5, Samsung Galaxy SIII, Motorola Droid RAZR) then choose Bluetooth    </li>
</ul><p> </p>
<h3>Will the <strong><em>SMART</em></strong> Cycling Helmet fit me? What size is the helmet?</h3>
<p>The sizes we're providing are medium (52-58cm) and large (59-61cm) and are the same standard sizes that Lazer is providing to all of its customers.</p>
<p>The weight of the helmet itself is 280g (M) with LifeBEAM physiological sensor &amp; processing unit adding only 50g.</p>
<p>After processing your payment, we will contact you and make sure we get your preferred helmet size.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Does it display the Heart-Rate all the time or will I have to do any action to see it?</h3>
<p>No additional action is needed except for turning your <strong><em>SMART</em></strong> helmet ON, wearing it and starting to cycle!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Since it is an Optical light sensor, does it have a problem in the sun? On bright days?</h3>
<p>No. Our system was successfully tested in different extreme weather and light environments. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What phones support the ANT+ protocol?</h3>
<p>Please check in the following <a href=""http://www.thisisant.com/directory"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">link</a> (choose “mobile phones/devices” category)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Will the SMART work with a skull cap?</h3>
<p>Our technology is an advanced variation of optical sensors commonly-used in hospitals for many years. In general, two light beams are transmitted to the skin and the reflection is measured in an electro-optical cell. This allows us to monitor changes in blood flow and extract heart rate. Blocking the light beam with any kind of cloth will prevent this action. The sensor is located on the helmet's front - gently touching the upper part of the forehead. As long as the cap doesn't block the sensor or isn't under the hairline - you're good to go.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Will the <strong><em>SMART</em></strong> Cycling Helmet work with my Android or iPhone?</h3>
<p>The <strong><em>SMART</em></strong> communicates over the ANT+ and Bluetooth 4.0 protocols. It sends out its data using the standard Heart-Rate Profiles to any devices that support these protocols and Profiles.</p>
<p>iPhones, Android &amp; Windows phone Smartphones can be used to display your Heart-rate data by using applications that support the Bluetooth 4.0 Heart-Rate Profile or have ANT+ support (via built-in ANT+ or via an available ANT+ dongle adapter).</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Can I upgrade my Perk at a later stage?</h3>

LifeBEAM is proud to present SMART -
The world's first smart cycling helmet with an integrated heart rate sensor, allowing real time, accurate, hassle-free heart-rate monitoring without using a chest strap!

The SMART platform is lightweight and incorporates a microprocessor integrated with LifeBEAM’s advanced algorithm, a state-of-the-art optical physiological sensor, accelerometer, and full wireless communication capabilities.
We Need Your Help!
While we have experience in the Aerospace industry, this is our first consumer facing product, and we need your help to make it a success!
The SMART Solution
We integrated our unique sensor & algorithms, originally developed for fighter pilots & astronauts, into the Lazer’s GENESIS helmet resulting in the SMART – a cycling helmet that provides highly accurate, real time measurements of heart rate under normal as well as extreme physiological conditions without the problems inherent to chest straps. The information gathered by the SMART appears in real time on your mobile phone, sport watch or cycling computer via ANT+ or Bluetooth.
Our sensing technology was built for intense activities in extreme environments and demonstrated highly accurate results compared to the most reliable ECG chest belts in market. It is, therefore, suitable for high performance athletes in any cycling environment.
 
Heart-Rate Monitoring
Cyclists who want to monitor and improve their performance cannot ignore their heart rate. Personal heart-rate provides a window to individual's overall fitness.
Heart rate is commonly monitored using chest straps. Fitness watches, cycling computers & smartphones - all provide a platform that can communicate with a chest strap and display heart rate.
But what if you hate wearing that strap around your chest for hours? Straps can chafe, irritate, lose contact and migrate. We now offer the perfect solution - the SMART.

What do you get with SMART?
The SMART will arrive to you ready-to-use with no assembly required.The systems includes:

Lazer Sport GENESIS helmet integrated with LifeBEAM sensing technology
LifeBEAM’s physiological sensor & processing unit:

Integrated 3-axis accelerometer
Bluetooth 4.0 or ANT+ Wireless Communication capabilities
Rechargeable Lithium battery - at least 15 hours of continuous usage
Weight: 50 grams (0.132 lbs.)


The sensor & technology integrated into the SMART platform will allow future implementation of additional sensing, sound & display features.

 From Aerospace to Cycling

LifeBEAM is a startup company comprised of engineers and pilots, passionate about the development of physiological monitoring solutions. We specialize in remote monitoring of multi-physiological parameters, such as heart-rate, blood flow, oxygen saturation and more.


Our first development was a unique miniature sensing platform that was implemented into fighter pilot and astronaut helmets, to monitor their physiological conditions, help them perform better, and in extreme cases – even save lives.
 
 
Now you can use this technology during cycling!
What could be simpler than putting on your SMART cycling helmet integrated with our small and almost invisible sensor, and continuously monitoring your heart rate?!
 
Technology - main features & benefits
LifeBEAM's core sensing technology is based on state of the art non-invasive optical methods, using miniature components that allow unobtrusive & continuous physiological monitoring. These unique sensing methods enable a high-accuracy measurement of various physiological parameters.
LifeBEAM's main technological expertise creates applicative solutions that are significantly insensitive to motion artifacts and thus can be used in dynamic environments and under extreme conditions. 
 

 
So what’s so cool about SMART?
SMART uses electro-optical technology to continuously measure your heart-rate.
The optical sensor is placed on the helmet’s front, gently touching your forehead. The sensor samples the blood pulse in a high frequency and transmits a raw signal to the processing unit, which is placed in the helmet’s back.

The processing unit filters the signal from motion artifacts and, using the communication module, wirelessly transmits the cleansed pulse to your display device in real-time.
 

 
AND…YES, IT WORKS WITH MOST DEVICES AND APPS IN THE MARKET!
The SMART is compatible with Bluetooth 4.0 & ANT+ devices - smartphones, fitness watches, cycling computers - and works with most fitness applications, so use your favorite display device or smartphone app for additional functions, such as: average speed, distance, pace, GPS, calories-burned, etc.
  
Future Developments
We plan to continue developing the SMART, keeping it up to date with the ever-changing technologies, in order to provide the best and most cutting-edge product for our customers.
Integrating a processing unit and wireless communication capabilities opens the door for various additional sensors & features that will be processed in the helmet and transmitted wirelessly to any place!
A few examples for some optional future implementations:

Additional Functions: Stand-alone device, Crash detection, Bicycle locator, integration with Cycling training apps for additional parameters and more!
Advanced display capabilities: head up display capabilities just like in fighter pilots helmets!
Additional Sensors: GPS, SIM, Logger and more!
Sound feedback features.
 
Prototyping process
After successfully monitoring a pilot's vitals, LifeBEAM wanted to expand and reach new horizons. 
On one of their weekend rides, two engineers from our team modified our technology and integrated it into their cycling helmets. 
Excited by the outcome and the idea of combining our technology with their love of cycling, they convinced the team to pursue their dream.
On the following 6 months, the R&D team worked together to amend the algorithms to suit the cycling environment and develop a kit that could be integrated into a professional cycling helmet while prolonging the battery life, maximizing the duration between charges, and without adding unnecessary weight.

After numerous testing iterations & prototype improvements, we were ready to choose the right helmet-manufacturing partner.

The $4,000 goal is the MINIMUM base required for our missions and the people, our teams, and churches need more!!! There is still 43 days left for the campaign. Let's join God and push beyond our original estimated amount! 
God is good, and He is worth sharing to the world! So let's continue to raise awareness and spread the word!
Our Mission As part of our calling to fulfill the Great Commission, Church of Southland  is currently engaged in missions work in Cincinnati, Ohio (USA), Indonesia, and Guatemala, as well as praying for new doors to open in other parts of the world. By committing training, prayer and financial support, and short-term missions projects to these areas, we believe that God will use us to help spread the Gospel message and build His kingdom among unreached peoples.    Join Now! Each Church of Southland member going to missions is providing for 50% of their cost to missions and we are praying faithfully for God to provide the other 50%. This is where you come in!
Church of Southland would like to invite you to join God in His redemptive work by participating  through prayer and/or financial support for the various members going to the mission field. 
We are fundraising for $4,000, however, we believe that God will provide more abundantly than we could ever expect. Your donation will go a long way in providing materials for the evangelism teams, Vacation Bible School tools and resources, and travel and lodging for the members. Also, your donations will also cover campaign fees, perk costs, and shipping/handling.
For your donation of $25 or more in God's work, we would like to send you a Thank You card and a one-of-a-kind designed T-shirt. Please select the member you would like to support to the right! If you're not familiar with any members, please select the General Mission Fund Perk.
Church of Southland is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization which means your donation is TAX DEDUCTIBLE!

<p>Néanmoins il s’agit systématiquement de nouveaux produits, ainsi, si l’on veut porter la belle montre de marque dont vous rêviez, ou que l’on vous a offert, tout en profitant des services d’une montre connectée, c’est impossible : </p>
<h4><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>Montre connectée ou montre de marque , il faut choisir : soit votre belle montre soit acheter une montre « connectée », à la rigueur, un bracelet connecté. </b></span></h4>

<p>Beaucoup ont acheté ou achètent des montres de marque, et souhaitent les conserver, en profiter,  tout en profitant aussi de ces nouvelles technologies et fonctionnalités. Et donc sans avoir à porter d’autres montres.  C’est à tous ceux-là que s’adresse ce concept, </p>
<p>En effet, ils possèdent une Rolex, une Hublot, une Piaget, une Timex, une Breitling, une Hermès, une Cartier, une Omega etc. ou toute autre montre de marque, comme une Swatch, une Fossil , une Tissot, etc …  ces noms de marque ne sont donnés qu’à titre d’exemple car ce n’est pas limitatif . CT watch s'adapte à (presque) toutes les montres à bracelet amovible. </p>
<p><b>CT Watch , intègre toutes les fonctionnalités nécessaires dans le bracelet de la montre lui même, avec discrétion. </b></p>

<p>La connexion Bluetooth offre par ailleurs de nouvelles fonctionnalités :</p>
<p><b>La spécificité d’une montre est que l’on porte celle-ci au poignet toute la journée, il est donc rare que l’on oublie sa montre. Celle-ci devient donc un dispositif - dont les fonctions sont très vastes - intégré à soi même en permanence </b></p>
<p><b>Fonction anti oubli : </b>en ajoutant un « tag » Bluetooth adapté à divers objets, ceux-ci sont liés à la montre : Lunettes, Stylos de marque, parapluie, manteau, chapeau, et bien sur la liaison avec le smartphone. Certains ""tags"" existent, mais nous n'excluons pas de développe les nôtres. </p>
<p>Si la montre s’éloigne d’un des objets connectés, celle-ci vous prévient par une vibration ou une sonnerie et affiche de quel objet il s’agit. </p>
<p>Cette fonction peut elle-même être intelligente et programmable et couplée au GPS du téléphone, de façon à éviter les alarmes intempestives : par exemple lorsque l’on est chez soi ou encore de ne pas oublier votre manteau parce que la température extérieure est basse. </p>
<p><b>Fonction, « trouver » </b> bi directionnelle : vous ne savez pas où vous avez mis votre téléphone, vous le faites sonner par la montre, et inversement. </p>
<p><b>Fonction de sécurité informatique :</b>  elle permet de verrouiller l’accès à votre ordinateur, tablette ou smartphone, si vous vous éloignez temporairement, par exemple , ou si vous décidez de verrouiller l’accès depuis votre bracelet montre pendant votre absence. Ce peut aussi être le cas pour votre voiture, votre bureau...</p>
<p><b>Fonction « match » : </b>dans le cadre d’applications diverses de réseaux sociaux. lié à votre profil, et lorsque vous croisez quelqu'un qui vous correspond. </p>
<p><b>Ainsi, les fonctions d’un « bracelet » ou d’une montre connectée se trouvent entièrement intégrés avec votre montre de marque et de manière discrète. </b></p>
<p>Des logiciels applicatifs sur smartphone ( IOS , Android et Windows) ainsi que leurs extensions  PC ou Mac permettent d’analyser divers paramètres d’activité de la journée  d’une part et d’interagir avec ces objets  d’autre part. </p>
<p>Les fonctions liées au smart phone et aux objets pouvant être connectés, sont les suivantes (non limitatives)  :</p>
<p>-  Prise ou rejet d’appel et identification de l’appelant  (affichage)</p>
<p>-  Affichage d’en têtes d’emails et SMS </p>
<p>-  Rappel de RDV </p>
<p>-  Commande et interaction avec des logiciels applicatifs divers du smart phone et des objets « connectés », pouvant être interfacés et interagir avec le dispositif CT Watch ajouté à la montre ( Gestes, dispositifs de commande intégrés au bracelet, ou encore par la voix) </p>
<p>-  Alertes et informations diverses</p>
<p>-  Température extérieure, météo locale </p>
<p>-  Enregistrement audio ( et vidéo en cas d'option caméra) </p>
<p>Le bracelet contient aussi une batterie, rechargeable soit par contact, soit par induction. conférant une autonomie de plusieurs jours . Un rappel de recharge s'affiche sur le téléphone et sur la montre, en cas d'oubli . Un micro connecteur USB permet une recharge filaire,</p>

<h3>Nos besoins</h3>
<p>Les fonds nécessaires,  correspondent aux coûts de développement de l'électronique et des logiciels , des études d'intégration et de design externe (cuirs) et de leur industrialisation, ainsi que des prototypes d'essai. </p>
<p>Ils concernent par ailleurs les premiers besoins marketing , et le lancement des séries initiales dans une variété de 20 coloris et textures de cuir, environ,  permettant de s'adapter à la plupart des montres à bracelet cuir ou simili </p>
</div><div>
<h3>L'impact marché</h3>
<p>Le marché des montres connectées , des bracelets ""intelligents"" et connectés est l'un des marchés en pleine expansion de ce début de 21 e siècle, il entre en concurrence frontale avec le marché des montres et du luxe et des bijoux féminins ou masculins, de poignet.</p>
<p>Hors, il est tout à fait possible, avec les progrès liés à la miniaturisation des composants,  de marier design, luxe et technologie, sans entrer en concurrence directe, mais en ""intégrant"" ces technologies aux aspects périphériques des montres par exemple. par leur bracelet. </p>
<p>C'est là notre objectif . </p>
<p><b>Le marché , tel que nous l'avons étudié , se chiffre à plusieurs millions d'unités par an</b>, en y intégrant toutes les déclinaison possibles en coloris, en textures, en ""fonctions"" orientés vers les Hommes, les Femmes, les Ados, ainsi que des produits de grand luxe qui peuvent être conçus pour leur aspect extérieur par des designers réputés en joaillerie.</p>
<p>Le prix marché  estimé sera de l'ordre de 89 € TTC en version de base et bracelet simili cuir et de l'ordre de 120 € à 199 € avec des cuirs de haute qualité et selon les options technologiques choisies.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risques et défis</h3>
<p> La technologie électronique est  très avancée et miniaturisée . L'intégration des diverses fonctions et liaisons hertziennes a été étudiée avec soin et ne pose pas de problèmes particuliers.</p>
<p>L'implantation des composants sur un substrat flexible a par ailleurs été étudiée avec soin de façon à éviter tout travail mécanique pouvant induire une déconnexion de composants à terme.</p>
<p>L'intégration GPS a été pour l'instant étudiée , mais sans décision d'implantation dans un premier temps, dans la mesure où le GPS du smartphone peut pallier cet éventuel besoin. </p>
<p>Nous avons par ailleurs étudié l'implantation batterie de façon à maximiser l'autonomie. </p>

A ce jour, le nombre de produits  que l’on appelle bracelets connectés ou montres connectées ne cesse de s’étendre, le récent lancement de la montre connectée d’Apple, montre à quel point ce marché est convoité par les grands de l’électronique grand public. 
Néanmoins il s’agit systématiquement de nouveaux produits, ainsi, si l’on veut porter la belle montre de marque dont vous rêviez, ou que l’on vous a offert, tout en profitant des services d’une montre connectée, c’est impossible : 
Montre connectée ou montre de marque , il faut choisir : soit votre belle montre soit acheter une montre « connectée », à la rigueur, un bracelet connecté. 

Mais avec CT Watch, vous n’avez pas à choisir  

CT Watch s’adresse à tous ceux qui souhaitent disposer de fonctionnalités nouvelles, que l’on peut trouver avec une montre connectée ou un bracelet, voire encore plus ,  mais sans avoir à porter ou acheter une montre connectée ou un bracelet. 
Beaucoup ont acheté ou achètent des montres de marque, et souhaitent les conserver, en profiter,  tout en profitant aussi de ces nouvelles technologies et fonctionnalités. Et donc sans avoir à porter d’autres montres.  C’est à tous ceux-là que s’adresse ce concept, 
En effet, ils possèdent une Rolex, une Hublot, une Piaget, une Timex, une Breitling, une Hermès, une Cartier, une Omega etc. ou toute autre montre de marque, comme une Swatch, une Fossil , une Tissot, etc …  ces noms de marque ne sont donnés qu’à titre d’exemple car ce n’est pas limitatif . CT watch s'adapte à (presque) toutes les montres à bracelet amovible. 
CT Watch , intègre toutes les fonctionnalités nécessaires dans le bracelet de la montre lui même, avec discrétion. 
Les bracelets CT Watch seront disponibles en de nombreuses variétés de cuir de couleurs, largeurs standards - 18 à 24 mm- et types d'attaches ). 





L’électronique embarquée offre les fonctionnalités suivantes :
• Accéléromètre 3D : 
Celui-ci permet de stocker l’activité, le nombre de pas, les calories, etc,  Il permet aussi de piloter tout appareil connecté ( Jeux, drones, TV, fonctions diverses) par détection de tous les mouvements. et donc par les gestes de la main ou les  mouvements du corps 
•  le GPS peut par exemple être intégré dans les bracelets montre d’enfant.
•  Mémoire de stockage (et carte micro sd) 
•  Liaison Bluetooth
•  Système NFS (optionnel) (paiement)
•  Système RF Tags (Optionnel )
•  Vibreur
•  Sonnerie
•Micro : permettant de commander diverses fonctions à reconnaissance vocale, ou encore d’enregistrer une conversation
•Camera ( optionnel ) 
CT Watch dispose du son, d’un  vibreur, d’un affichage par micro-leds de 4 lignes . Ainsi  aucun affichage n’est visible, lorsque non nécessaire. et de 3 zones de commande sur le bracelet. 


CT Watch se base sur des composants montés sur support flexible de ce type 



Ces divers dispositifs permettant à CT Watch d’agir et d’interagir avec tout objet avec lequel CT Watch peut être connecté.
La connexion Bluetooth offre par ailleurs de nouvelles fonctionnalités :
La spécificité d’une montre est que l’on porte celle-ci au poignet toute la journée, il est donc rare que l’on oublie sa montre. Celle-ci devient donc un dispositif - dont les fonctions sont très vastes - intégré à soi même en permanence 
Fonction anti oubli : en ajoutant un « tag » Bluetooth adapté à divers objets, ceux-ci sont liés à la montre : Lunettes, Stylos de marque, parapluie, manteau, chapeau, et bien sur la liaison avec le smartphone. Certains ""tags"" existent, mais nous n'excluons pas de développe les nôtres. 
Si la montre s’éloigne d’un des objets connectés, celle-ci vous prévient par une vibration ou une sonnerie et affiche de quel objet il s’agit. 
Cette fonction peut elle-même être intelligente et programmable et couplée au GPS du téléphone, de façon à éviter les alarmes intempestives : par exemple lorsque l’on est chez soi ou encore de ne pas oublier votre manteau parce que la température extérieure est basse. 
Fonction, « trouver »  bi directionnelle : vous ne savez pas où vous avez mis votre téléphone, vous le faites sonner par la montre, et inversement. 
Fonction de sécurité informatique :  elle permet de verrouiller l’accès à votre ordinateur, tablette ou smartphone, si vous vous éloignez temporairement, par exemple , ou si vous décidez de verrouiller l’accès depuis votre bracelet montre pendant votre absence. Ce peut aussi être le cas pour votre voiture, votre bureau...
Fonction « match » : dans le cadre d’applications diverses de réseaux sociaux. lié à votre profil, et lorsque vous croisez quelqu'un qui vous correspond. 
Ainsi, les fonctions d’un « bracelet » ou d’une montre connectée se trouvent entièrement intégrés avec votre montre de marque et de manière discrète. 
Des logiciels applicatifs sur smartphone ( IOS , Android et Windows) ainsi que leurs extensions  PC ou Mac permettent d’analyser divers paramètres d’activité de la journée  d’une part et d’interagir avec ces objets  d’autre part. 
Les fonctions liées au smart phone et aux objets pouvant être connectés, sont les suivantes (non limitatives)  :
-  Prise ou rejet d’appel et identification de l’appelant  (affichage)
-  Affichage d’en têtes d’emails et SMS 
-  Rappel de RDV 
-  Commande et interaction avec des logiciels applicatifs divers du smart phone et des objets « connectés », pouvant être interfacés et interagir avec le dispositif CT Watch ajouté à la montre ( Gestes, dispositifs de commande intégrés au bracelet, ou encore par la voix) 
-  Alertes et informations diverses
-  Température extérieure, météo locale 
-  Enregistrement audio ( et vidéo en cas d'option caméra) 
Le bracelet contient aussi une batterie, rechargeable soit par contact, soit par induction. conférant une autonomie de plusieurs jours . Un rappel de recharge s'affiche sur le téléphone et sur la montre, en cas d'oubli . Un micro connecteur USB permet une recharge filaire,
Chaque bracelet est livré avec un support de recharge




Nos besoins
Les fonds nécessaires,  correspondent aux coûts de développement de l'électronique et des logiciels , des études d'intégration et de design externe (cuirs) et de leur industrialisation, ainsi que des prototypes d'essai. 
Ils concernent par ailleurs les premiers besoins marketing , et le lancement des séries initiales dans une variété de 20 coloris et textures de cuir, environ,  permettant de s'adapter à la plupart des montres à bracelet cuir ou simili 

L'impact marché
Le marché des montres connectées , des bracelets ""intelligents"" et connectés est l'un des marchés en pleine expansion de ce début de 21 e siècle, il entre en concurrence frontale avec le marché des montres et du luxe et des bijoux féminins ou masculins, de poignet.
Hors, il est tout à fait possible, avec les progrès liés à la miniaturisation des composants,  de marier design, luxe et technologie, sans entrer en concurrence directe, mais en ""intégrant"" ces technologies aux aspects périphériques des montres par exemple. par leur bracelet. 
C'est là notre objectif . 
Le marché , tel que nous l'avons étudié , se chiffre à plusieurs millions d'unités par an, en y intégrant toutes les déclinaison possibles en coloris, en textures, en ""fonctions"" orientés vers les Hommes, les Femmes, les Ados, ainsi que des produits de grand luxe qui peuvent être conçus pour leur aspect extérieur par des designers réputés en joaillerie.
Le prix marché  estimé sera de l'ordre de 89 € TTC en version de base et bracelet simili cuir et de l'ordre de 120 € à 199 € avec des cuirs de haute qualité et selon les options technologiques choisies.

Risques et défis
 La technologie électronique est  très avancée et miniaturisée . L'intégration des diverses fonctions et liaisons hertziennes a été étudiée avec soin et ne pose pas de problèmes particuliers.
L'implantation des composants sur un substrat flexible a par ailleurs été étudiée avec soin de façon à éviter tout travail mécanique pouvant induire une déconnexion de composants à terme.
L'intégration GPS a été pour l'instant étudiée , mais sans décision d'implantation dans un premier temps, dans la mesure où le GPS du smartphone peut pallier cet éventuel besoin. 
Nous avons par ailleurs étudié l'implantation batterie de façon à maximiser l'autonomie.

Savage Village is
a new independent clothing outfitter specializing in merchandise inspired by horror films, pop culture, and music. 
Established in Flint, Michigan, SVC will initially sell products online via webstore. Every shirt or sticker ordered in this way is helping us fulfill the rest of the start-up capital. The start-up is vital to the growth of the company. We are personally inviting the community to grow WITH our company from the beginning.
(Note from founder) 
""SVC is a brand mostly built using SATIRE, we do NOT want to be taken too seriously. In no way do we promote hate, this brand reflects culture. We are the overfill of an over-saturation.""
-Stephen ""Shipwreck"" Shippritt. 

  What We Need & What You Get
The funding total will go towards the cost to order and print t-shirts, stickers, panties, koozies, and sunglasses in the debut product supplies.
Our chosen theme is robust and
caters to a large market, this is our strength. In the future, the company will
also explore other markets as a new channel for growth.
The owner will run the business from his home office.
Inventory will be stored in a 40 sq ft designated storage area within the
home. Sales will be primarily handled through a Bigcartel.com store space until the
website is fully developed, part way through the second month. 
All t-shirts will be printed on 50/50 blend textile, using high quality silk screens.

We both have children that are grown and doing well. a dream of mine had always been to become an artist, and so he suggested I go back to school. He helped make my dream come true. Now at 62 years of age (and in great shape) he too has a longtime unrealized dream that I want desperately to come true. When he was a young auto mechanic of 20 years old, he began to build a funny car for drag racing. His then wife, expecting their second child, insisted that he sell the car and give up this ""ridiculous dream"" and focus on house and home, and so he did. Some years later the marriage ended but the dream lived on. Forty years pass, always working on other peoples cars and projects but never his own. Five years ago an opportunity came into our lives. He purchased the frame of a front engine nostalgia dragster. Over the past few years he has managed to put together all the components to build a fully functioning machine. Now certified and ready to run, we have one last hurdle to jump. We can muddle through with the flatbed trailer we currently have to haul it to the races, but he needs a SFI 3.3 - 20  safety fire suite which includes: Jacket, pants, boots and gloves in the amount of $1500.00. We are sooo close! I want so much for him to make it this time. I am asking for support to help purchase the suite.</p><p>A loving wife<br/></p></div>","ten years ago I married a wonderfully loyal, respectful and selfless man.

<h3>About me and my brand</h3>
</div>
<div> Since launching her label Tidal Cool Creations in 2012, Andrea Howell has quickly climbed the ranks and gained recognition for her design and tailoring skills. After her first runway event, Cleveland Fashion Week, Howell has gone on to participate in Michigan Fashion Week, Pittsburgh Fashion Week, and Kansas City Fashion Week, and shown in many private runway productions, including a celebrity event in New York City. Howell has collaborated with top-notch photographers and models throughout the country, and been published in fashion magazines in NYC, Chicago, and Europe. </div>
<div>Howell's love of color and bold prints is evident throughout her designs. ""I try and take you on a journey around this world with my clothing, whether its a rich silk brocade from Asia or a wax block print from Africa, we all need more color in our lives."" This is especially evident in her summer party dress collection, which combines bright cottons and funky prints in unexpected ways.<br/><div> </div>
<div>Andrea's organic approach is largely due to her learning to sew at a young age. ""Having mastered many of the sewing skills at a young age allows me to concentrate on the aesthetics of clothes rather than the construction"", Howell says of her artistic approach. She is comfortable with a wide variety of garments, from lingerie to hand sewn red carpet gowns, and enjoys the challenge of new techniques.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Andrea is based in Cleveland, Ohio, where she lives with her young son, cat, and 6 snakes. When she's not in the workroom, she can be found camping, sailing, kayaking, swimming with sharks, or traveling to remote destinations. </div>

""I try and take you on a journey around this world with my clothing, whether its a rich silk brocade from Asia or a wax block print from Africa, we all need more color in our lives."" This is especially evident in her summer party dress collection, which combines bright cottons and funky prints in unexpected ways. 
Andrea's organic approach is largely due to her learning to sew at a young age. ""Having mastered many of the sewing skills at a young age allows me to concentrate on the aesthetics of clothes rather than the construction"", Howell says of her artistic approach. She is comfortable with a wide variety of garments, from lingerie to hand sewn red carpet gowns, and enjoys the challenge of new techniques.
 
Andrea is based in Cleveland, Ohio, where she lives with her young son, cat, and 6 snakes. When she's not in the workroom, she can be found camping, sailing, kayaking, swimming with sharks, or traveling to remote destinations.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We need your support in launching our truly innovative collection that will disrupt the Men's Underwear Industry. </p>
<p>The SilkSuit LLC is proud to offer the ultimate underwear experience for Men.  We created a new revolutionary innovation that is simple, elegant, sexy and may provide a solution to increase and reinvigorate lost virility. </p>
<p>It's going to make you laugh - so do so. It's funny so you should be laughing. We do. Make note of the energy this brings when you tell friends!</p>
<p>It's Here. Custom Fit Men's Anatomical Underwear</p>
<p>We have to be a little crazy obviously, but the background of the company is in designing, developing, selling and implementing Custom Global Trading Systems for Financial Services, literally, all over the world. Groomed in systems and efficiency, a best friend and I found a flaw in Men's Underwear and were immediately convinced we had something. </p>
<p>After all, I wear socks and STILL have a callous on <strong>both</strong> big toes! So being circumcised, not covering the little guy <em>had</em> to have an effect - and not a good one. Logical right?</p>
<p><strong>WHY THE SILK SUIT?</strong></p>
<p>This flaw is an opportunity to educate, and provide a solution to hundreds of millions of Men, creating a new market within the global men’s underwear industry. <br/>For Men, the pleasure ""control center"", the Glans, the head constantly rubs against the underwear. We call this the ‘<strong><em>sandpaper effect</em></strong>’. </p>
<p>Due to this constant, day after day, week after week, Year after Year, DECADE AFTER DECADE subtle abrasion - this ""sandpaper effect"" causes the delicate nerve endings and blood vessels that are the source of the pleasure sensation for men, to move further and further away from the surface - forming, essentially, a ""<em>callous</em>"". A layer of Keratin (protein in hair and nails) forms just beneath the skin. </p>
<p>This thickness causes a loss of sensation. The new sensations don't ""tickle"" but a deeper more satisfying experience. An example is putting a supercharger or turbos on a muscle car. Does it <strong>need</strong> it? Maybe not, but superchargers and turbos are cool and make the muscle car perform even better. That's the essence of the SilkSuit.</p>
<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
<p>The SilkSuit is Custom Fit Anatomical Men’s Underwear, a double layered sheath of the finest stretchable, breathable fabric. Like a second skin. The SilkSack is a pouch of the same fabric for the ‘boys’. The SilkSuit stays on by super soft secure Baby elastic. (Ever see a baby with <em><strong>blue feet</strong></em>?)</p>
<p>The SilkSuit+ comes with an opening to make going to the bathroom simple and quick.</p>
<p>The SilkSuit is custom fit like an expensive Suit tailored to fit your body – made for you!</p>
<p><strong>Athletes and Active Lifestyles!</strong></p>
<p>A this is huge for you. jockstraps are abrasive. Burlap. change it up and experience that extra boost of 'young legs', extra energy like Pacino in ""Raging Bull"" (no foolin around before a fight!), bounce in your toes! That kind of energy or 'extra step'. </p>

<h2>What’s a supercollar®?</h2>
<p>It’s not a bird, it’s not a plane... it’s supercollar®, the dog collar with a built-in leash.</p>
<p>The name pretty much says it all; supercollar® is a revolutionary, one of a kind dog collar that will change the way dog lovers interact with their best friends during walk time... and any time, really.</p>
<p>We have some fantastic praise from the big dogs and here’s what they are barking about: </p>
<ul>
<li>The supercollar® was featured by Dr. Debbye Turner Bell on <em>The Early Show</em>, CBS’ national morning news program. </li>
<li>The supercollar® was featured in <em>People Pets, USA Today, Chicago Tribune, Gizmodo, Los Angeles Times, Uncrate, Runway Magazine, Fido Friendly Magazine, Pet Age, Haute Dog, Pet Elite,</em> and over 100 more.</li>
<li>The supercollar® won the <strong>2011 PET AGE Pinnacle® Award</strong>.</li>
<li>The supercollar® won the <strong>3M 2011 In-New-Vation Award</strong> for the Most Innovative Product.</li>
<li>The supercollar® won the <strong>2011 British Airways Face of Opportunity Award</strong>.</li>
</ul><p>Our supercollar® is patented, endorsed by veterinarians, and proudly made in the USA. </p>
<div class=""template""><img alt=""Rocky the Boxer sporting a Large in Big Sky Blue"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.supercollar.com/images/rocky.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<h2>What makes supercollar® so cool?</h2>
<p>Here’s the deal… with supercollar®, your dog is always carrying its own leash!</p>
<p>Imagine,</p>
<ul>
<li>never having to look for the leash again. It’s already on. It’s always on! â€¨</li>
<li>never having to worry about tripping yourself or your dog with traditional or retractable leads that get tangled around everyone’s legs.</li>
<li>having your pet walking beside you, not dragging you, the way it’s supposed to be.</li>
</ul><p>Imagine no more… supercollar® to the rescue!</p>
<div class=""template""><img alt=""An original supercollar® in action, good boy!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.supercollar.com/images/Elvis-02.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<h2>How does supercollar® work?</h2>
<p>The supercollar® is a patented, innovative collar and leash combo that replaces the traditional separate collar and leash. It’s a unique alternative to every other leash and collar on the market. </p>
<p>The built-in retractable leash allows you to gain immediate control of your dog, instead of having to take the time to attach a leash.</p>
<div class=""template""><img alt=""Check out the ergonomic molded handle... just grab it and gogo!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.supercollar.com/images/utahoutside.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>When you need to control your dog, you simply release the safety lock on the collar and pull out the retractable leash. If you like using other leashes, you can still do so, as the supercollar® includes a ""D"" ring for attachment. Even if you prefer a traditional leash, the supercollar® is like an insurance policy for those times you are without one.</p>
<p>The supercollar® is designed to be strong, durable, and is completely waterproof. The collar is made of sturdy webbing and features two specialized, patented retractors containing high-tech cables. Although the cables may look delicate, they are extremely strong. Check out our video to see a supercollar® pull a 2,700 pound car if you want to see how strong it is… but don’t try this at home!</p>
<p>supercollar® will be available in four sizes for dogs weighing 10 to 120 lbs.</p>
<div class=""template""><img alt=""Medium in Big Sky Blue"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.supercollar.com/images/SC2012M-BSB-2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<h2>Where can I use my supercollar®?</h2>
<p>The real question is, ""Where CAN'T I use my supercollar®?”</p>
<p>A run on the beach, hike on the trail, visit to the dog park, or just hopping in the car and heading out with your favorite four-legged friend is a snap with supercollar®. </p>
<p>It’s perfect for anyone who wants to make life easier and is quickly becoming the collar that dogs and their owners can’t live without.</p>
<div class=""template""><img alt=""Our FEMA friend Tank and his sporty original supercollar® lazing in the snow. So much majesty!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/164141_490380601874_323010296874_6380663_2574149_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<h2>Why support supercollar®?</h2>
<p>An emergency veterinarian, an inventor, a couple of entrepreneurs, and a great bunch of dogs came together to create a dog owner’s dream accessory: supercollar®. </p>
<p>Throwing tradition out the window, we crafted a smart leash &amp; collar combo, giving the WOW factor to two products that needed a little innovation. </p>
<p>We are passionate about the safety of dogs, spending time with our furry, four-legged friends and keeping America working.</p>

<h2>Who’s running this campaign... it’s the supercollar® team!</h2>
<p><strong>Jane Angelich</strong> is the CEO of Bright IP Concepts, LLC, the parent company for the revolutionary new pet product, supercollar®. Prior to supercollar®, she spent more than 25 years as an entrepreneur, a business coach, a writer and a speaker. </p>
<p>For over eight years, Jane has been a volunteer for Guide Dogs for the Blind. She and her husband reside in the San Francisco Bay Area. When she’s not busy working, Jane spends time with her family, which includes two Labrador Retrievers from Guide Dogs for the Blind.</p>
<p>She is the proud mother of two sons and a newly minted grandmother. Her second book, <em>What’s a Mother (In-Law) to Do?</em>, was released by Simon &amp; Schuster in June 2009. It is the winner of the 2009 National Best Books Awards in the relationships category. </p>
<p><strong>Dr. Jim Clark</strong> is the CFO of Bright IP Concepts, LLC and the key veterinary consultant in supercollar’s revolutionary design. He brings more than 20 years of experience in veterinary practice, primarily in emergency and critical care medicine to the supercollar® team.</p>
<p>As one of the founders of Bright IP Concepts, Dr. Clark has played an integral role in the design and development of the supercollar®. According to Jim, “this product combines my passion for animal safety with my desire to bring something new and exciting to market.” </p>
<p>Dr. Clark serves on the Animal Welfare Committee of the California Veterinary Medical Association. He currently works as a veterinary emergency clinician and a part-time professor at the U.C. Davis School of Veterinary Medicine.</p>
<p>Jim received his undergraduate and veterinary degrees from U.C. Davis and an MBA degree from the San Diego State College of Business Administration, graduating as valedictorian of his class. He and his family, which includes three dogs and two cats, reside in the San Francisco Bay Area where he is currently an owner in a growing network of emergency/specialty practices.</p>
<div class=""template""><img alt=""Medium in Original Black (for formal affairs)"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.supercollar.com/images/SC2012M-1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><strong>Alex Metzroth</strong> is the COO of Bright IP Concepts, LLC. He has been instrumental in the design, manufacturing, and distribution of supercollar®.</p>
<p>After graduating from Cornell University in 2005, Alex managed and consulted for the acclaimed international restaurant group, China Grill Management, in New York City. His management concepts are so innovative that the company adopted his policies and standard operating procedures on a global level.</p>
<p>Alex's front-end customer skills combined with back-end operations management, along with his desire to be part of a start-up organization, and his love of all things four-legged are the perfect combined experiences to assist supercollar® as it launches its global brand.</p>
<p>Alex resides in San Francisco in a building that doesn’t allow pets, so he pet-sits frequently to get his dog on.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Price</strong> is the Vice President of Research and Development of Bright IP Concepts, LLC. As one of the inventors of supercollar®, Ryan is an avid adventurer and passionate dog lover.  He often encountered problems with traditional leashes getting caught around legs and tripping everyone. </p>
<p>While walking his dog Tenor, he had a light bulb moment! Ryan realized the need for a collar/leash combo that would alleviate the hassle that traditional leashes present when you want to turn your dog loose to run.</p>
<p>""Traditional leashes are a problem because you can’t just let go; you must call your dog over to you, unclip the leash, and then let your dog run."" During this particular walk, Ryan looked at his wife and said, “what if the dog carried his own leash?” At this moment, supercollar® was born. </p>
<p>Ryan met Jane Angelich, CEO of supercollar®, while waiting in line for a show... and the rest is history!</p>

<h2>How can you help us gogo all the way?</h2>
<p>So here is where you come in. We have funded this project ourselves, to this point. Now that we are introducing supercollar® version 2.0, we really need to scale up production and create cool new packaging to give this distribution campaign a bite even bigger than our bark.</p>
<p>Indiegogo is a great vehicle to allow us to build up the necessary working capital to meet our manufacturers' minimum order quantities for product and packaging and make supercollar® available to everyone. Shortly after this Indiegogo project is successfully funded, we will be able to start selling a full range of beautifully packaged supercollar® in retail stores.</p>

<h2>IndieColor: Voter's Choice </h2>
<p>You're going to be part of the design process! Six color options are ready to go: Original Black, Big Red, Big Sky Blue, Blaze Orange, Lilac Purple &amp; Pretty Pink.</p>
<p>If you pledge any of the color options, we'll email you a survey after the project closes so you can vote on a new 7th color option. Later on, we'll email you again asking which of the final color options you'd like to select. Even if you don't like the Voter's Choice, you'll be able to choose from the other six.</p>

People Pets: “Supercollar is the best of both worlds:  a leash and collar in one.”

What’s a supercollar®?
It’s not a bird, it’s not a plane... it’s supercollar®, the dog collar with a built-in leash.
The name pretty much says it all; supercollar® is a revolutionary, one of a kind dog collar that will change the way dog lovers interact with their best friends during walk time... and any time, really.
We have some fantastic praise from the big dogs and here’s what they are barking about: 

The supercollar® was featured by Dr. Debbye Turner Bell on The Early Show, CBS’ national morning news program. 
The supercollar® was featured in People Pets, USA Today, Chicago Tribune, Gizmodo, Los Angeles Times, Uncrate, Runway Magazine, Fido Friendly Magazine, Pet Age, Haute Dog, Pet Elite, and over 100 more.
The supercollar® won the 2011 PET AGE Pinnacle® Award.
The supercollar® won the 3M 2011 In-New-Vation Award for the Most Innovative Product.
The supercollar® won the 2011 British Airways Face of Opportunity Award.
Our supercollar® is patented, endorsed by veterinarians, and proudly made in the USA. 

What makes supercollar® so cool?
Here’s the deal… with supercollar®, your dog is always carrying its own leash!
Imagine,

never having to look for the leash again. It’s already on. It’s always on! â€¨
never having to worry about tripping yourself or your dog with traditional or retractable leads that get tangled around everyone’s legs.
having your pet walking beside you, not dragging you, the way it’s supposed to be.
Imagine no more… supercollar® to the rescue!

How does supercollar® work?
The supercollar® is a patented, innovative collar and leash combo that replaces the traditional separate collar and leash. It’s a unique alternative to every other leash and collar on the market. 
The built-in retractable leash allows you to gain immediate control of your dog, instead of having to take the time to attach a leash.

When you need to control your dog, you simply release the safety lock on the collar and pull out the retractable leash. If you like using other leashes, you can still do so, as the supercollar® includes a ""D"" ring for attachment. Even if you prefer a traditional leash, the supercollar® is like an insurance policy for those times you are without one.
The supercollar® is designed to be strong, durable, and is completely waterproof. The collar is made of sturdy webbing and features two specialized, patented retractors containing high-tech cables. Although the cables may look delicate, they are extremely strong. Check out our video to see a supercollar® pull a 2,700 pound car if you want to see how strong it is… but don’t try this at home!
supercollar® will be available in four sizes for dogs weighing 10 to 120 lbs.

Where can I use my supercollar®?
The real question is, ""Where CAN'T I use my supercollar®?”
A run on the beach, hike on the trail, visit to the dog park, or just hopping in the car and heading out with your favorite four-legged friend is a snap with supercollar®. 
It’s perfect for anyone who wants to make life easier and is quickly becoming the collar that dogs and their owners can’t live without.

Why support supercollar®?
An emergency veterinarian, an inventor, a couple of entrepreneurs, and a great bunch of dogs came together to create a dog owner’s dream accessory: supercollar®. 
Throwing tradition out the window, we crafted a smart leash & collar combo, giving the WOW factor to two products that needed a little innovation. 
We are passionate about the safety of dogs, spending time with our furry, four-legged friends and keeping America working.

Who’s running this campaign... it’s the supercollar® team!
Jane Angelich is the CEO of Bright IP Concepts, LLC, the parent company for the revolutionary new pet product, supercollar®. Prior to supercollar®, she spent more than 25 years as an entrepreneur, a business coach, a writer and a speaker. 
For over eight years, Jane has been a volunteer for Guide Dogs for the Blind. She and her husband reside in the San Francisco Bay Area. When she’s not busy working, Jane spends time with her family, which includes two Labrador Retrievers from Guide Dogs for the Blind.
She is the proud mother of two sons and a newly minted grandmother. Her second book, What’s a Mother (In-Law) to Do?, was released by Simon & Schuster in June 2009. It is the winner of the 2009 National Best Books Awards in the relationships category. 
Dr. Jim Clark is the CFO of Bright IP Concepts, LLC and the key veterinary consultant in supercollar’s revolutionary design. He brings more than 20 years of experience in veterinary practice, primarily in emergency and critical care medicine to the supercollar® team.
As one of the founders of Bright IP Concepts, Dr. Clark has played an integral role in the design and development of the supercollar®. According to Jim, “this product combines my passion for animal safety with my desire to bring something new and exciting to market.” 
Dr. Clark serves on the Animal Welfare Committee of the California Veterinary Medical Association. He currently works as a veterinary emergency clinician and a part-time professor at the U.C. Davis School of Veterinary Medicine.
Jim received his undergraduate and veterinary degrees from U.C. Davis and an MBA degree from the San Diego State College of Business Administration, graduating as valedictorian of his class. He and his family, which includes three dogs and two cats, reside in the San Francisco Bay Area where he is currently an owner in a growing network of emergency/specialty practices.

Alex Metzroth is the COO of Bright IP Concepts, LLC. He has been instrumental in the design, manufacturing, and distribution of supercollar®.
After graduating from Cornell University in 2005, Alex managed and consulted for the acclaimed international restaurant group, China Grill Management, in New York City. His management concepts are so innovative that the company adopted his policies and standard operating procedures on a global level.
Alex's front-end customer skills combined with back-end operations management, along with his desire to be part of a start-up organization, and his love of all things four-legged are the perfect combined experiences to assist supercollar® as it launches its global brand.
Alex resides in San Francisco in a building that doesn’t allow pets, so he pet-sits frequently to get his dog on.
Ryan Price is the Vice President of Research and Development of Bright IP Concepts, LLC. As one of the inventors of supercollar®, Ryan is an avid adventurer and passionate dog lover.  He often encountered problems with traditional leashes getting caught around legs and tripping everyone. 
While walking his dog Tenor, he had a light bulb moment! Ryan realized the need for a collar/leash combo that would alleviate the hassle that traditional leashes present when you want to turn your dog loose to run.
""Traditional leashes are a problem because you can’t just let go; you must call your dog over to you, unclip the leash, and then let your dog run."" During this particular walk, Ryan looked at his wife and said, “what if the dog carried his own leash?” At this moment, supercollar® was born. 
Ryan met Jane Angelich, CEO of supercollar®, while waiting in line for a show... and the rest is history!

How can you help us gogo all the way?
So here is where you come in. We have funded this project ourselves, to this point. Now that we are introducing supercollar® version 2.0, we really need to scale up production and create cool new packaging to give this distribution campaign a bite even bigger than our bark.
Indiegogo is a great vehicle to allow us to build up the necessary working capital to meet our manufacturers' minimum order quantities for product and packaging and make supercollar® available to everyone. Shortly after this Indiegogo project is successfully funded, we will be able to start selling a full range of beautifully packaged supercollar® in retail stores.
 

IndieColor: Voter's Choice 
You're going to be part of the design process! Six color options are ready to go: Original Black, Big Red, Big Sky Blue, Blaze Orange, Lilac Purple & Pretty Pink.
If you pledge any of the color options, we'll email you a survey after the project closes so you can vote on a new 7th color option. Later on, we'll email you again asking which of the final color options you'd like to select. Even if you don't like the Voter's Choice, you'll be able to choose from the other six.

Can I help in other ways?
Absolutely! Please, please, PLEASE spread the word about supercollar® to your friends and family! Talk about our project when you see dogs and their owners walking by. Share the info on your Facebook wall, Twitter feed and other social sites. Visit our website and like/follow our Facebook and Twitter pages by following the links below:

<p class=""article_text"">• Tightly secured to the passenger seat and providing sufficient space for storing virtually any size handbag, the BNB would permit drivers to leave their purses open, without worry.

<p>The diameter of a watch case is an important factor, and everyone has their own preference. We have tested a number of sizes, and ultimately decided on 42mm. Here’s how that looks on 3 different wrists.</p>

<p>Swiss Made watches are of high quality, admired around the world for their excellence. The only problem is that a watch which is labeled Swiss Made may in fact consist almost entirely of parts made in Asia!</p>

<p> </p>
<p>For this reason we have decided to be completely transparent on origin, and to choose Swiss and international parts based on their distinctiveness and high value for money; not in order to meet the criteria of a deceptive Swiss Made label.</p>
<p>Our watches are high quality, manufactured in the best Chinese workshops, which have been producing many of the components for Swiss brands for decades.</p>

<p>The online market is growing stronger by the day, but it does still have a few drawbacks: most significantly the inability to see the watch in person before buying it.</p>
<p>Thanks to an innovative application, anyone who would like to order one of our models, but who wants to see it first, is able to speak with and meet a CODE41 watch owner close to them. Like this, the buyer can order their watch free of doubt, and the sponsor receives their 10% commission.</p>

<p>41 is the country code for Switzerland. Although our approach is based on international synergy, in terms of both manufacturing and our community, we do want to commemorate our fondness for Switzerland.</p>
<p>In computing, code 41 is a system error. We really like it as an analogy for our project, which represents an ANOMALY in the Swiss watchmaking system. </p>

<p>En Mars 2016, une mystérieuse équipe de cowboys, connue sous le nom de GOLDGENA PROJECT, sème le trouble dans l’univers feutré de l’horlogerie suisse en dévoilant les secrets du Swiss Made. Ça a rendu certains très mécontents mais d’autres, beaucoup d’autres, nous ont rejoint dans la création de CODE41 : Une marque communautaire qui a pour objectif de créer de la belle horlogerie mécanique à des prix accessibles en étant complètement transparent sur l’origine, les coûts et le développement.</p>

<p>Nous sommes un atelier de design horloger basé en Suisse. En un peu plus de 11 ans, nous avons eu l’honneur de collaborer avec les marques horlogères les plus prestigieuses. Les montres mécaniques nous fascinent et particulièrement celles où le mécanisme fait partie intégrante de l’esthétique. Malheureusement, elles sont souvent hors de prix. Alors nous nous sommes mis au travail avec la ferme intention de créer une pièce spectaculaire en utilisant un mouvement mécanique standard.</p>

<p>Le cadran est travaillé en niveau avec une esthétique usinée qui transpire la mécanique pour qu’il devienne un prolongement du mouvement.

    In March 2016, a mysterious team of cowboys, known only as the GOLDGENA PROJECT, began sowing the seeds of doubt in the hushed world of Swiss watchmaking by exposing the secrets of the Swiss Made label.That made some people very unhappy, but others, many others, have joined us. Today is the day that we, along with our community of 15,000 registered members and 50,000 followers, launch CODE41: a community brand with the aim of creating attractive mechanical watches at reasonable prices, through a policy of complete transparency on origin, costs and development.   We are a watch design workshop based in Switzerland. In a little over 11 years we have had the honor of working alongside the most prestigious names in watchmaking. We are fascinated by mechanical watches; especially those in which the mechanism is an integral part of the aesthetic of the piece. Unfortunately, they are often just too expensive. This is why we set to work with the clear objective of designing a spectacular piece using a standard mechanical movement.


 

 
The dial is levelly sculpted, with a machined look that radiates ‘mechanical’ to the point that it becomes an extension of the movement.
The case is simple, elegant and wearable, but both its lugs and its screwed container design ensure an appearance that is strong, distinctive and recognizable.

For those who prefer simplicity, subtlety and elegance, allow us to introduce ANOMALY-02. A 3 hand date model fitted with the Swiss ETA 2824 automatic movement.

 

ETA 2824-2SWISS MECHANICAL AUTOMATIC MOVEMENTHours, minutes, sweep second and dateSelf-winding mechanismPower reserve (if not worn): 40 hours28.800 vibrations per hour25 Jewels

The Japanese MIYOTA and Swiss ETA movements are of the utmost quality, precision and reliability. We have chosen our components for their high value for money and distinctiveness, rather than their origin. 
 

 

 
You will have access to a variety of easily interchangeable straps, which are compatible with all of our models. 

 

 
To complete the range, we are currently working on textile, metal and rubber straps, which will be available in 2017. 
 
 
 

 

 
The diameter of a watch case is an important factor, and everyone has their own preference. We have tested a number of sizes, and ultimately decided on 42mm. Here’s how that looks on 3 different wrists.
 

 

 
Swiss Made watches are of high quality, admired around the world for their excellence. The only problem is that a watch which is labeled Swiss Made may in fact consist almost entirely of parts made in Asia!

 
For this reason we have decided to be completely transparent on origin, and to choose Swiss and international parts based on their distinctiveness and high value for money; not in order to meet the criteria of a deceptive Swiss Made label.
Our watches are high quality, manufactured in the best Chinese workshops, which have been producing many of the components for Swiss brands for decades.

 

 
 


 
We will be manufacturing our watches with transparency in mind. To this end we have created the TTO Label: Total Transparency on Origin. A kind of ID card will be included with each of our watches, as well as being available online. It will indicate the exact origin of each component and each stage of the process.
 

 

 
We are going to be transparent not only on origin, but also on the costs of production and development.


 
 
Distribution networks are saturated, and are not in tune with modern purchasing behavior. We are going to cut out the middlemen of traditional distribution and promote community power so that we can be closer to you, thus halving the retail price.
But that’s not all…we also want to share our success with you by offering a commission for each sale you generate.

 

 
The online market is growing stronger by the day, but it does still have a few drawbacks: most significantly the inability to see the watch in person before buying it.
Thanks to an innovative application, anyone who would like to order one of our models, but who wants to see it first, is able to speak with and meet a CODE41 watch owner close to them. Like this, the buyer can order their watch free of doubt, and the sponsor receives their 10% commission.

 

 

 

 

 
41 is the country code for Switzerland. Although our approach is based on international synergy, in terms of both manufacturing and our community, we do want to commemorate our fondness for Switzerland.
In computing, code 41 is a system error. We really like it as an analogy for our project, which represents an ANOMALY in the Swiss watchmaking system. 
 
 
 
 
Notre campagne est maintenant terminée. Merci beaucoup pour votre incroyable soutien! Vous pouvez toujours commander votre CODE41 sur notre site www.code41.ch




 

 

 

 
En Mars 2016, une mystérieuse équipe de cowboys, connue sous le nom de GOLDGENA PROJECT, sème le trouble dans l’univers feutré de l’horlogerie suisse en dévoilant les secrets du Swiss Made. Ça a rendu certains très mécontents mais d’autres, beaucoup d’autres, nous ont rejoint dans la création de CODE41 : Une marque communautaire qui a pour objectif de créer de la belle horlogerie mécanique à des prix accessibles en étant complètement transparent sur l’origine, les coûts et le développement.

 

 
Nous sommes un atelier de design horloger basé en Suisse. En un peu plus de 11 ans, nous avons eu l’honneur de collaborer avec les marques horlogères les plus prestigieuses. Les montres mécaniques nous fascinent et particulièrement celles où le mécanisme fait partie intégrante de l’esthétique. Malheureusement, elles sont souvent hors de prix. Alors nous nous sommes mis au travail avec la ferme intention de créer une pièce spectaculaire en utilisant un mouvement mécanique standard.

 

 
Le cadran est travaillé en niveau avec une esthétique usinée qui transpire la mécanique pour qu’il devienne un prolongement du mouvement. La boîte est simple, élégante et portable, mais ses cornes ainsi que sa construction en caisson lui confèrent une esthétique forte, particulière et reconnaissable.

En Chine, comme partout dans le monde, on trouve une qualité et des prix très variables parmi les entreprises d’un même secteur. Nos montres sont de haute qualité et sont fabriquées dans les meilleurs ateliers chinois qui produisent depuis des décennies bon nombre de composants pour les marques suisses.  

 
Nous allons fabriquer nos montres sous le signe de la transparence. Pour ce faire nous avons créé le Label TTO : Transparence Totale sur l’Origine. Une sorte de carte d’identité sera jointe à chacune de nos pièces et disponible en ligne. Elle indiquera très précisément l’origine de chaque composant et de chaque opération.

 

 
Nous allons être transparents sur l’origine mais également sur les coûts de fabrication et le développement.

 

 
Les réseaux de distribution sont saturés et ne sont pas en phase avec les nouveaux comportements d’achat. Nous allons supprimer les intermédiaires de la distribution traditionnelle et favoriser la puissance communautaire pour être plus proche de vous et diviser ainsi le prix public par 2.
Mais ce n’est pas tout... nous voulons également partager notre succès avec vous en vous versant une commission pour chaque vente que vous générez.

 

 
La vente online se développe de plus en plus mais présente quelques lacunes, la principale étant l’impossibilité de toucher la montre avant de l’acheter.
Grâce à une application, une personne qui aimerait commander l’un de nos modèles, mais pas sans l’avoir vu, peut dialoguer et rencontrer le possesseur d’une montre CODE41 proche de lui. L’acheteur peut ainsi commander en toute confiance et le parrain touche sa commission de 10%.

 

 

 

 

 
Le 41 est le code pays de la Suisse. Bien que notre démarche soit fondée sur une synergie internationale, tant du point de vue de la fabrication que de la communauté, nous voulons marquer notre attachement à la Suisse.
En informatique le code 41 est une erreur système. Nous aimons bien l’analogie avec notre projet qui représente une anomalie (d'où le nom de nos modèles ANOMALY) dans le système horloger suisse.",78.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>
<p>Montree designs consciously hip clothing for the urban bohemian. All garments are handmade and sustainably sourced from eco-jersey, up-cycled lace, and indigenous trims. Montree is comfortable, wearable, versatile, and above all beautiful.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>MONTREE CUSTOMER</h3>
<p>The hipster, the hippie, the creative, the activist, the yogi, the nature lover, the city lover. She is looking to save the world, while making it beautiful at the same time.

<p> </p>
<h3>GROWING UP</h3>
<p>Montree is growing! Last year I made close to 400 pieces doing all the designing, sourcing, and sewing myself. More importantly, all 400 pieces sold in a handful of fairs, trunk shows, and online stores. This year, Montree’s team is starting to grow too, and OUR goal for this year is to make and sell at least 1000 pieces. We will do more fairs and shows, create and promote our own montreedesigns.com web store, and begin to include more retail stores always reaching out to our loyal and rapidly growing following.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>THE OPPORTUNITY</h3>
<p>This demand for Montree finally allows, and even requires that I no longer do all the sewing myself. Yeaaah!!!  This is a very exciting opportunity because it allows me not only to grow, but also to transfer my energy to designing even better quality pieces, as well as sales and marketing, allowing Montree to grow even more in the years to come and empower even MORE women along the way!!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>THE PROJECT</h3>
<p>With your help, we are setting up a whole new supply chain in Mexico, which in addition to scaling production will improve quality while ALSO increasing our positive social impact. This is important because I am dedicated to creating fashion that not only helps make the world more beautiful, but also helps create a more sustainable, just, and compassionate world for <strong>everyone.</strong></p>

<h3>MY BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>I have been designing and making clothes for as long as I can remember. As a child I would cut up my own clothes to create designs for my dolls. Inspired by this, my mother planted the seed by encouraging me to become a fashion designer. I studied fashion design at Columbia College in Chicago. I then moved to San Francisco and studied fashion, merchandising, and product development at FIDM. Seeking cultural, aesthetic, and spiritual inspiration, I traveled extensively through India, Nepal, Thailand, Latin America, Europe, and Africa. In my time abroad, I found a love for the planet and for working with indigenous women whose skills I found inspiring and irreplaceable. MonTree's current projects are inspired by my recent work with women from Ghana, Mexico, Peru, and shelters in Brooklyn. Im dedicated to empowering women and making their beauty come alive.</p>

<p>Well, I was trying to post the shot of Pride 2 for those interested in the print and to no avail. So see above.  </p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<h2>I'm CM Glover, founder of Milieu and this app - ""Cruising the North East: Westbrook to Watch Hill"".  I've spent most of my adult life 'behind the camera'.</h2>
<p>I received my MAH from the University of Virginia and studied abroad for awhile as a grad student.</p>
<p>As a professional photojournalist for the past 'few' years, the New York Times has been a big client since 1999.  They've had me all over Connecticut, as well as in RI and MA. I've met an amazing number of people and have always enjoyed the feature work.  Other well known clients have included Smithsonian, National Geographic, Chesapeake Bay Magazine, the Baltimore Sun, Patuxent Publishing and not long ago I contributed several images to the Rick Smolan book, ""America at Home"".  In the last few years I have been searching for a way to continue being creative (in the way I most enjoy - shooting and writing editorial) in an ever changing publishing industry.  This is how Milieu came into being.</p>
<p>We are creating an iPad app for boaters which will feature the eastern CT shoreline from Westbrook to Watch Hill; with special mention of day trips to Orient Point, Fisher's Island, and Block Island.  Instead of a series of lists, it will be written in the form of articles - in an engaging editorial style.  Think special edition travel style magazine...</p>
<p>This app is geared toward recreational boaters, both power and sail, from dinghies to yachts, and will be the first in a series of apps covering the north east.  However, travelers by land will also find much of the information interesting.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Collaborators</h3>
<p>On board we also have K.H. Aspinwall, a videographer and owner of Hamilton Communications in Westbrook, CT.  With over 25 years as a professional, he is looking forward to some time out on the water.</p>
<p>By the way - don't blame him for my little slideshow - he is slammed right now with work and I threw that together with my old iMovie.  We needed to get this posted. Video in the app will be extraordinary!</p>
<p>We also have Renee Beaulieu, professional writer, editor and copy editor, plus a sailing enthusiast for many years, who will be helping with the editing when it is time to throw all of this material together into a readable format.</p>
<p>And we will be getting some help from Sara Guzzo, graphic designer; Jacob Wilson, programmer and designer; and several others in the creative community.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>We are seeking initial funding with this campaign to keep the momentum going as we get into the peak boating season this summer.  In particular we need to get all of the photos and video shot while the boating season is in full swing.</h3>
<div>
<h3>Following is a brief outline of what the app will include:</h3>
<p><strong>~ Features of the eastern Connecticut coastline.</strong></p>
<p>- Geographic (to include aerial slideshow)</p>
<p>- Ambiance of accessible local towns</p>
<p><strong>~ Popular boating areas.</strong></p>
<p>- scenic</p>
<p>- anchorages</p>
<p>- day trips</p>
<p><strong>~ Nearby destinations for larger craft</strong>.</p>
<p>- Block Island</p>
<p>- Fisher's Island</p>
<p>- Orient Point, LI</p>
<p>- Newport/ Jamestown, RI</p>
<p><strong>~ Marinas &amp; places to dock.</strong></p>
<p>- What they offer ... amenities, fuel, repairs, etc</p>
<p>- What they can accommodate </p>
<p><strong>~ Walking Distance.</strong></p>
<p>- Restaurants/Bars - esp. restaurants with their own docks.</p>
<p>- Amenities - incl. yacht clubs, Sailing Foundation, free bikes in Mystic and NL</p>
<p>- Attractions</p>
<p>- Supplies - food, toiletries, etc.</p>
<p>- General shopping - clothing, jewelry, tourist</p>
<p><strong>~ Don't Miss</strong></p>
<p>- Most popular things in all categories. Example - Esker Point's free summer beach concerts.</p>
<p><strong>~ Things to know before you go.</strong></p>
<p>- Boat ramps, brief descriptions, links to state website.</p>
<p>- Weather - fog</p>
<p>- Fishing - permits and limitations.  (However this is not a fishing app so basic info only on permits and with applicable links).</p>
<p>- Coast Guard - basic rules and contact info.</p>
<p>- Warnings - uncharted obstacles</p>
<p>- Helpful - beaches that allow you to walk dogs.</p>
<p>- Car rental - Enterprise picks up.</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<h3>All funds will help.  Among the things we need to pay for are; aerial photography, videography, editing, copy editing, design and layout, programming the app and of course photography and writing, plus the associated expenses.</h3>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>OUR PERKS</strong></h2>
<div>After researching this I have been told that Apple will not allow us to 'give away' apps for which we are planning to charge a fee.  Even though we are not planning to charge more than ~ $2.99 for this app.</div>
<div>So for our perks I have had to come up with other options.  If you know differently and know a way that we can give copies of the app to contributors (with minimal paperwork - since we are trying to keep our budget <em>way</em> down) please shoot me an email and let me know how this can be done.  CruisingNE@gmail.com</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My goal has been to get you all involved as much as possible.  And I am most certainly open to your suggestions for perks!</div>
<div> </div>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Corporate Rewards (Advertising/Sponsorships)</h2>
<p>We are actively seeking advertisers.   In order to present an elegant and readable design to our readers, we are limiting advertising to a maximum of eight full page ads.</p>
<p>This app will be available for download (for a nominal fee) for a projected two years, until a new edition with updated content will replace it.  Advertisers/sponsorships remain in the app until the next edition, at which time they will have the option to renew.  Your full page ad will be in place for a minimum of a year, plus your logo will be placed on the website (not up yet), and we are considering having each advertiser be the featured advertiser for a period of one month in any marketing emails.</p>
<p>Sponsorships will be available for video segments.  ""Sponsored by"" in the title, with your logo and links on the page.  And for a premium, a 30 second clip of the sponsor's facility or product can be added to the end of video segments.  (We can produce the clip or you may provide it, but again we have quality control).</p>
<p>If you have something else you would like to do as a video sponsor we are open to suggestions.  Think 'elegant' ...</p>
<p>Advertisers may also place video or slideshows within their full page ad, but this is also a 'premium' ad.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>If you do not have the resources to help, but you like what we are doing - please, please spread the word!!  We will rain many blessings down upon you.  : )</h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>When we reach (or exceed) our total funding goals - and not just this initial round of funding, but all of it - we will be holding a launch party for the app next spring in CT.  Everyone who has contributed at least $250 to the project, as a patron, sponsor, or advertiser, will be a special VIP at the party.  However, we will make it possible for others to come with a small contribution going to a local non-profit.</h3>
<h3><em>So help us reach all of our funding goals and we will have a great party to celebrate the app and the beginning of boating season next year!!</em></h3>
<h3>If you are interested, we will be happy to keep you posted.  I can't be specific about a venue at this time, but water and boats will be involved.  </h3>
<h3>: )</h3>
<p>If you have any ideas for perks we haven't mentioned - please send an email.</p>
<p>CruisingNE@gmail.com</p>
<p>I will be personally responding to each email in as timely a manner as possible.  Most emails to be sent in the middle of the night... ; )</p>
<h3> </h3>

I've met an amazing number of people and have always enjoyed the feature work.  Other well known clients have included Smithsonian, National Geographic, Chesapeake Bay Magazine, the Baltimore Sun, Patuxent Publishing and not long ago I contributed several images to the Rick Smolan book, ""America at Home"".  In the last few years I have been searching for a way to continue being creative (in the way I most enjoy - shooting and writing editorial) in an ever changing publishing industry.  This is how Milieu came into being.
We are creating an iPad app for boaters which will feature the eastern CT shoreline from Westbrook to Watch Hill; with special mention of day trips to Orient Point, Fisher's Island, and Block Island.  Instead of a series of lists, it will be written in the form of articles - in an engaging editorial style.  Think special edition travel style magazine...
This app is geared toward recreational boaters, both power and sail, from dinghies to yachts, and will be the first in a series of apps covering the north east.  However, travelers by land will also find much of the information interesting.
 
Collaborators
On board we also have K.H. Aspinwall, a videographer and owner of Hamilton Communications in Westbrook, CT.  With over 25 years as a professional, he is looking forward to some time out on the water.
By the way - don't blame him for my little slideshow - he is slammed right now with work and I threw that together with my old iMovie.  We needed to get this posted. Video in the app will be extraordinary!
We also have Renee Beaulieu, professional writer, editor and copy editor, plus a sailing enthusiast for many years, who will be helping with the editing when it is time to throw all of this material together into a readable format.
And we will be getting some help from Sara Guzzo, graphic designer; Jacob Wilson, programmer and designer; and several others in the creative community.
 


What We Need & What You Get
 
We are seeking initial funding with this campaign to keep the momentum going as we get into the peak boating season this summer.  In particular we need to get all of the photos and video shot while the boating season is in full swing.

Following is a brief outline of what the app will include:
~ Features of the eastern Connecticut coastline.
- Geographic (to include aerial slideshow)
- Ambiance of accessible local towns
~ Popular boating areas.
- scenic
- anchorages
- day trips
~ Nearby destinations for larger craft.
- Block Island
- Fisher's Island
- Orient Point, LI
- Newport/ Jamestown, RI
~ Marinas & places to dock.
- What they offer ... amenities, fuel, repairs, etc
- What they can accommodate 
~ Walking Distance.
- Restaurants/Bars - esp. restaurants with their own docks.
- Amenities - incl. yacht clubs, Sailing Foundation, free bikes in Mystic and NL
- Attractions
- Supplies - food, toiletries, etc.
- General shopping - clothing, jewelry, tourist
~ Don't Miss
- Most popular things in all categories. Example - Esker Point's free summer beach concerts.
~ Things to know before you go.
- Boat ramps, brief descriptions, links to state website.
- Weather - fog
- Fishing - permits and limitations.  (However this is not a fishing app so basic info only on permits and with applicable links).
- Coast Guard - basic rules and contact info.
- Warnings - uncharted obstacles
- Helpful - beaches that allow you to walk dogs.
- Car rental - Enterprise picks up.

 
All funds will help.  Among the things we need to pay for are; aerial photography, videography, editing, copy editing, design and layout, programming the app and of course photography and writing, plus the associated expenses.
 
OUR PERKS
After researching this I have been told that Apple will not allow us to 'give away' apps for which we are planning to charge a fee.  Even though we are not planning to charge more than ~ $2.99 for this app.
So for our perks I have had to come up with other options.  If you know differently and know a way that we can give copies of the app to contributors (with minimal paperwork - since we are trying to keep our budget way down) please shoot me an email and let me know how this can be done.  CruisingNE@gmail.com
 
My goal has been to get you all involved as much as possible.  And I am most certainly open to your suggestions for perks!
 


Corporate Rewards (Advertising/Sponsorships)
We are actively seeking advertisers.   In order to present an elegant and readable design to our readers, we are limiting advertising to a maximum of eight full page ads.
This app will be available for download (for a nominal fee) for a projected two years, until a new edition with updated content will replace it.  Advertisers/sponsorships remain in the app until the next edition, at which time they will have the option to renew.  Your full page ad will be in place for a minimum of a year, plus your logo will be placed on the website (not up yet), and we are considering having each advertiser be the featured advertiser for a period of one month in any marketing emails.
Sponsorships will be available for video segments.  ""Sponsored by"" in the title, with your logo and links on the page.  And for a premium, a 30 second clip of the sponsor's facility or product can be added to the end of video segments.  (We can produce the clip or you may provide it, but again we have quality control).
If you have something else you would like to do as a video sponsor we are open to suggestions.  Think 'elegant' ...
Advertisers may also place video or slideshows within their full page ad, but this is also a 'premium' ad.
 


If you do not have the resources to help, but you like what we are doing - please, please spread the word!!  We will rain many blessings down upon you.  : )
 
When we reach (or exceed) our total funding goals - and not just this initial round of funding, but all of it - we will be holding a launch party for the app next spring in CT.  Everyone who has contributed at least $250 to the project, as a patron, sponsor, or advertiser, will be a special VIP at the party.  However, we will make it possible for others to come with a small contribution going to a local non-profit.
So help us reach all of our funding goals and we will have a great party to celebrate the app and the beginning of boating season next year!!
If you are interested, we will be happy to keep you posted.  I can't be specific about a venue at this time, but water and boats will be involved.  
: )
If you have any ideas for perks we haven't mentioned - please send an email.
CruisingNE@gmail.com
I will be personally responding to each email in as timely a manner as possible.  Most emails to be sent in the middle of the night... ; )",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Bamboo clothing reinvented. <br/>We are Nooboo. We started our adventure while exploring opportunities for high quality bamboo clothing vs regular cotton. </p>
<p>We established partnerships with producers of the highest quality bamboo fiber who are also focusing on a environmental friendly production process.</p>
<p>Our products are designed in Amsterdam, locally harvested near bamboo forests and assembled and produced in Portugal and Indonesia. Keeping quality as our highest goal, whilst keeping a close eye out for the environment and design, we managed to create a product that stands for more comfort, heat regulation, breathability and sustainability. </p>
<p>We choose our suppliers carefully to make sure that the production process is in a closed loop and ethically sourced. Our suppliers are paid a life supporting salary and we focus on going green throughout the entire supply chain including packaging. </p>
<p>Our sweaters, socks and boxer shorts are made from 100% organic bamboo fiber, making the products soft and durable. Our t-shirts and longsleeves are made from 60% organic bamboo fiber and 40% organic cotton. We’ve created the perfect balance between bamboo fiber and organic cotton, with as main goal to produce products with the qualities of bamboo and the firmness of cotton. With this combination we’ve managed to create products that are not only sustainable and good for the environment, but are also the perfect mix of fabric for soft yet strong products made to last.</p>
<p>Welcome to Nooboo!</p>

<p><strong>Breathing and humidity regulating </strong><br/>Our products do not wring the skin or have an uncomfortable fit, on the contrary they let the skin breathe freely. The products also absorb humidity better than cotton or other fabrics. This combination results in optimized comfort and durability! Whether you are wearing our products on a daily basis or breaking a sweat in the gym, you will be amazed with the comfort you’re experiencing. </p>
<p><strong>Antibacterial and odor resistant </strong><br/>Bamboo is one of the plants that is naturally resistant to bacteria’s, making it easy to keep and environmentally friendly to grow. Derived from the plant, bamboo fiber is also naturally resistant to bacteria. As a result of this the fabric is no ground for bacteria to grow on and produce their side effects, such as a nasty smell. No, with bamboo products you will hand first experience an odor repellent fabric. </p>
<p><strong>Hypoallergenic and protective </strong><br/>Bamboo is naturally hypoallergenic, which makes it perfect to wear for people with a sensitive skin or allergies. No more itching and scratching and no more rashes or red spots from wearing a piece of clothing. Next to that bamboo clothing actually protects your skin! It prevents 95% of harmful UV radiation to reach your skin, opposite to 75% prevention that cotton provides. This makes bamboo especially good to wear when you’re out in the sun a lot, or when the sun shines its brightest. </p>
<p><strong>Softness </strong><br/>Mixing bamboo fiber and cotton can best be described as the difference between Kashmir to regular wool. It is one of the softest, yet sturdiest, fabrics known to man! </p>
<p><strong>Thermodynamic body regulation </strong><br/>The structure of bamboo fiber is using the principle of thermodynamics, making it cool to wear in the summer and warm to wear in the winter. This makes the products perfect the wear for any type of weather and any type of activity, including athletic activities. You no longer need a winter and summer wardrobe with our products, they are wearable all year round!</p>

<p><br/><strong>100% biodegradable </strong><br/>Opposed to synthetics with similar qualities of bamboo fiber, bamboo fiber is 100% biodegradable. </p>
<p><strong>Clean farming </strong><br/>Bamboo is a plant that gets all its nutrients and energy from the soil. This means that no (artificial) fertilizers are needed for its optimal growth. </p>
<p><strong>Saves water </strong><br/>Bamboo only needs sun and natural rainwater to grow. Irrigation is not needed, which makes bamboo one of the few fabrics that is self-supportive. Because of the sustainable nature of bamboo, you save 3500 liters of water per bamboo shirt! 3500 liters of water = 100 showers.</p>
<p><strong>No pesticides </strong><br/>Bamboo is naturally resistant against insects and fungus and can be grown without the use of pesticides. </p>
<p><strong>Quick grower </strong><br/>Bamboo is the fastest growing plant on the planet and grows up to a meter per day. The production harvest of bamboo is 10 times larger than the production harvest of cotton, in the same amount of space. Bamboo stems are cut and harvested, allowing the plant to grow further without replanting. The roots of bamboo stems are holding firmly in the soil. This has a huge impact on soil stability and water drainage. </p>
<p><strong>Oxygen giver </strong><br/>Bamboo forests produce 30% more oxygen and absorb more carbon dioxide than regular forests. This makes bamboo one of the best plants for the climate. <br/> </p>

Our sweaters, socks and boxer shorts are made from 100% organic bamboo fiber, making the products soft and durable. Our t-shirts and longsleeves are made from 60% organic bamboo fiber and 40% organic cotton. We’ve created the perfect balance between bamboo fiber and organic cotton, with as main goal to produce products with the qualities of bamboo and the firmness of cotton. With this combination we’ve managed to create products that are not only sustainable and good for the environment, but are also the perfect mix of fabric for soft yet strong products made to last.
Welcome to Nooboo!


 
Breathing and humidity regulating Our products do not wring the skin or have an uncomfortable fit, on the contrary they let the skin breathe freely. The products also absorb humidity better than cotton or other fabrics. This combination results in optimized comfort and durability! Whether you are wearing our products on a daily basis or breaking a sweat in the gym, you will be amazed with the comfort you’re experiencing. 
Antibacterial and odor resistant Bamboo is one of the plants that is naturally resistant to bacteria’s, making it easy to keep and environmentally friendly to grow. Derived from the plant, bamboo fiber is also naturally resistant to bacteria. As a result of this the fabric is no ground for bacteria to grow on and produce their side effects, such as a nasty smell. No, with bamboo products you will hand first experience an odor repellent fabric. 
Hypoallergenic and protective Bamboo is naturally hypoallergenic, which makes it perfect to wear for people with a sensitive skin or allergies. No more itching and scratching and no more rashes or red spots from wearing a piece of clothing. Next to that bamboo clothing actually protects your skin! It prevents 95% of harmful UV radiation to reach your skin, opposite to 75% prevention that cotton provides. This makes bamboo especially good to wear when you’re out in the sun a lot, or when the sun shines its brightest. 
Softness Mixing bamboo fiber and cotton can best be described as the difference between Kashmir to regular wool. It is one of the softest, yet sturdiest, fabrics known to man! 
Thermodynamic body regulation The structure of bamboo fiber is using the principle of thermodynamics, making it cool to wear in the summer and warm to wear in the winter. This makes the products perfect the wear for any type of weather and any type of activity, including athletic activities. You no longer need a winter and summer wardrobe with our products, they are wearable all year round!
 


100% biodegradable Opposed to synthetics with similar qualities of bamboo fiber, bamboo fiber is 100% biodegradable. 
Clean farming Bamboo is a plant that gets all its nutrients and energy from the soil. This means that no (artificial) fertilizers are needed for its optimal growth. 
Saves water Bamboo only needs sun and natural rainwater to grow. Irrigation is not needed, which makes bamboo one of the few fabrics that is self-supportive. Because of the sustainable nature of bamboo, you save 3500 liters of water per bamboo shirt! 3500 liters of water = 100 showers.
No pesticides Bamboo is naturally resistant against insects and fungus and can be grown without the use of pesticides. 
Quick grower Bamboo is the fastest growing plant on the planet and grows up to a meter per day. The production harvest of bamboo is 10 times larger than the production harvest of cotton, in the same amount of space. Bamboo stems are cut and harvested, allowing the plant to grow further without replanting. The roots of bamboo stems are holding firmly in the soil. This has a huge impact on soil stability and water drainage. 
Oxygen giver Bamboo forests produce 30% more oxygen and absorb more carbon dioxide than regular forests. This makes bamboo one of the best plants for the climate.

I work in the north of Italy, Andrea lives in London, coming back to Italy one time a month for business and Giovanni is just back from US after a long period also in the UK; we came to terms this is the perfect moment to seize our dream. 
 
 
 
 
We aim to satisfy different kind of people, betting on our own tastes, on what we like; choosing t-shirts to start up our adventure.
 
 
Insert Coin 
is the first collection we've created as very representative of our main concept
 
 
 
 
The grafic style of the 80's videogames is hard to forget for us, so many hours spent in front of the old videogames.These simple words ""insert coin"" bring our memory back to that moment, when the coins for a new game were over. Now we're grown ups, insert coin means getting you to gamble on your cards, take the chances, move on your ideas forward, make it real and show it to the world.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Hero
 
 
 
 

Tilt
 
 
 

1P
 
 
 
 
Rock Fabric 
 is the second one, dedicated to three icons became mouthpieces of entire generations, not only for music but also for their style, attitude and life philosophy. Rock Fabric points out the thoughts of these artists, underlining how nowadays some their words are extremely actual and enhancing their cultural influence over art.

Rock Fabric tees are in grey color too
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
When Giovanni told us about Indiegogo we were really impressed ! You guys know better than us how a smart way like this can be important for people starting up something they believe in.
We are excited to have this opportunity and share it to the world. Hopefully you share our vision and willing to become a part of our story by making a pledge and history.
 
 
 
 
 
Our goal to raise over $ 5,000 will go towards production of our collections :



Establishing an inventory with existing designs.


adding new ones



fulfilling the perks

We appreciate each and every deed you can do.
We've spent a lot of money to register the copyright and we're lucky to have great friends that helped us for the other stuff like the samples t-shirts, the photo shoot, the video and the website.At this time we need your support to make our dream come true.
 
 

 
 
We choose an important company which usually works for accomplished Italian brands, able to guarantee quality and professionality.
We wanna make comfortable high quality t-shirts only with a particular style and woven so we decided for the cotton slub type, raw cut neckline and raw cut sleeves 100% cotton durable, lightweight, in order to let the tees breathe and fit perfectly on your body.
Concerning screen printing we choose the best quality, the t-shirts most people are used to are made by putting ink onto the shirt (plastisol) and over time the image can crack and peel.We wanted to avoid this. The discharge process lifts dye from the shirt leaving you with an image that is literally part of the fabric and undetectable to the touch.
 
 
 

 
Select a method of pledging found on the right. Once Indiegogo releases the funds, we'll get to work on starting production.
Once ready for delivering we'll contact you again requesting you to confirm your choice.
 
 
 
 

Are the colors shown the only ones available? Will you be adding more later?
  
Yes and maybe! The colors shown are the only ones we have available right now.
 However, we'll start adding new color options (and even new tees!) depending on popular demand.
 
    
What about the size ?
  
S – M – L – XL european standard sizes, we'll send to you all the details about the measurements.
   
 
Do you confirm mailing addresses before shipping?
   
Yes. So if you're planning to move before we ship, don't worry.
  
 

 
 
We're ready to give our best to capitalize on your support, we've always been waiting for a chance like this.We've put our life apart to start up this adventure, believing in our skills and betting on them.The chosen company for the production is on standby, waiting for us to give it the green light and we've planned to ensure the successful completion of all perks (no matter how many) in a timely manner.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tell anyone that owes you a gift. If no one owes you a gift, tell them you deserve one. Buy yourself a gift. Buy a friend a gift. Buy your loved one a gift. Just pledge and make Homemade Fabric a reality!
 
 
 
Moreover, let's keep in touch !

<p>We are a team of two European Landscape Designers living, and starting up our own business in Ireland. We are also both passionate about dancing Tango.</p>
<p>The team:</p>
<p><strong>Tünde</strong> Szentesi, leaving behind Hungary and her professional career as an HR consultant, moved to Ireland 7 years ago to pursue her hobby – Gardening. She earned a degree as a Landscape Architect at the University of Gloucestershire in England. At the moment she is working as a Gardener/Designer in Dublin. In her creations she would like to express practicality, beauty and harmony combined with innovative solutions.She  tries to reflect her artistic sensibility by applying colors and forma in a new, exciting way.</p>
<p><strong>Svaja</strong> Vaicula graduated with distinction from Senior College Dun Laoghaire with a BTEC Higher National Diploma in Landscape Design.  Having graduated with a Diploma in Garden Design from Vilnius College Lithuania, she relocated to Dublin to further her education and career. With an in-depth knowledge of both practical and design aspects of horticulture her design philosophy revolves around the communication between hard and soft landscape elements putting special emphasis on an organic sustainable approach. She holds the Winner of BLOOM 2008 award for small garden design.</p>
<p><strong>About the Project</strong></p>
<p>We created “Eco Tango Garden” - a fun dancing and dining sustainable outdoor living space.</p>
<p><strong>Our concept</strong> of the design is to illustrate how people can create a greener garden from recycled materials on a small site (ours is 5m by 7m). They can grow food and have a lot of fun in a sustainable way. We’re eating, playing, exercising-relaxing, and dancing Argentine Tango in our garden!</p>
<p>We take a holistic attitude to the gardening. It is important because we need to consider all the needs of humans and plants in order to achieve a good healthy and happy environment that we all desire.</p>
<p>In our fresh approach to sustainable garden design we’re delivering a stylish garden that uses resources efficiently and at the same time we save time, money, effort, and materials. We look for techniques to find the greenest solutions. We are creating a sustainable garden without compromising on design. We are also reusing materials in a creative way: </p>
<p>Canopy from Utoplast (recycled melted plastic innovated by Juli Laczko (<a href=""http://plastenka.hu/%20/t%20_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">plastenka.hu</a>); vertical wall from pallets; stage and footpath from scaffold planks, just to name a few.</p>
<p> A significant part of our sustainable scheme relates to the way we manage rainwater. In our garden, it is harvested using the canopy and then directed to different parts of the garden. Some is collected; some goes directly to irrigate the plants, while the excess is soaked away.</p>
<p>In our planting pattern we are using aesthetically pleasing, edible and medicinal plants. We have chosen a dominant white flower colour scheme for its healing properties. We’re using red poppy flowers for interest and contrast and to express a Tango passion.</p>
<p><strong>We are hoping that with your help we will achieve completion of our dream garden on Bloom show 2013!</strong></p>
<p>This show is Ireland's largest gardening, food and family event which takes place annually in the Phoenix Park Dublin during the June Holiday weekend (30th May - 3rd June 2013). Bloom 2012 was the 6th year of the event, attracting almost 80,000 visitors to the 70 acre site. - including Designer gardens, Garden expert stage, Food Village, Floral marque etc. More information here:<a href=""http://bloominthepark.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://bloominthepark.com/</a></p>
<p>For us this is a huge opportunity to show our ideas, how to be more environmentally conscious and have fun at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Be part of it!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Let’s bring together two great passions– </strong><strong>Gardening and Tango</strong></p>
<p>We would like to introduce simple and smart ideas to show how you can make a nice environment with a small effort and with edible plants, and forgotten herbs like wild garlic (Allium ursinum) or woodruff (Gallium odoratum). And we would like to give opportunity to other artists, who have got innovative ideas like Juli, who innovated the Utoplast recycled canopy material.</p>
<p>We will be very delighted to raise 2500 Euro. With this amount of money we will be able to complete our show garden to the highest standard possible.</p>
<p><strong>Be a participant of Bloom 2013</strong> and give us a huge opportunity to teach people to be more environmentally conscious.  </p>
<p>Our unique perks will give you lots of information about sustainable living, edible plants, herbs and Argentine Tango. You will also be able to share your experiences with us and Eco Garden Community.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s build a society</strong> committed with open minded people who can live in a healthy and fun way.</p>

<h3>Amae Love wants *your* help to create your favorite clothes &amp; jewels! Let me take you with me on my journey...</h3>
<p>Hello beautiful people, I'm Amae Love. A question: Have you ever wanted that perfect clothing item or accessory that's made just for you? NOW is the time to help me deliver that to you just in time for festival season, at a lower cost available to anyone else, while you help me realize my dream of making my next album! (You can hear &amp; enjoy my conscious-bluesy-soulful musical creations so far at <a href=""http://www.amaelove.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.amaelove.com</a>.)</p>
<p>""Album? I thought this was for a clothing line..."" you may be thinking. Allow me to explain: Being a designer is what makes it *possible* for me to be an independant musician. With funds raised from this campaign, I will be able to produce a new line and make a living from the income while I work on and fund my next album. It gives me a way to expand my business and make a long term living, therefore giving me the freedom to remain independant, produce conscious and high integrity music with no compromises, and to be able give my music as a gift if I choose. I've been doing this already but on a smaller scale, without the the ability to truly save money to make the album, or the time to focus fully on what it will really take to launch my music career. In today's music climate, artists need to develop themselves, and there is so much I want to give. I am dedicated to helping raise consicousness on the planet through music, and to true sustainable health of the body, spirit, and planet through everything that I do.  I know am on the cusp of taking my design business and my music career to the next level and with your help, I will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>produce a higher volume of product, adding up to more profit,</li>
<li>do more wholesale, adding up to more free time,</li>
<li>and hire one employee,</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore freeing up my time to devote myself fully to music! WOW that would make me cry tears of joy. If I meet or exceed my goal, this will insure I will have enough after selling my production to fund my new Gospel-Soul-Blues album, all about empowerment, following the heart, and turning challenges into treasure. :)</p>
<p>SO, in exchange for this blessing, my intention is to create a win-win-WIN by using this campaign as a means to deliver customized orders at a lower cost to you, while I use your feedback to create the best designs yet! It support me and it supports you, AND the wonderful famliy of tailors I work with.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>SO basically, it's very simple: the perks/rewards ARE the designs!</p>
<ul>
<li>Funds raised will go DIRECTLY to the prodcution and delivery of the clothing, including fabric, sewing costs, and shipping, plus a very small amount to admistitrative costs. (I have already paid for my own travel costs.)</li>
<li>You can get any of the designs already available *right away* if you use PayPal (please see my etsy store: <a href=""https://www.etsy.com/shop/amaelove"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.etsy.com/shop/amaelove</a>) OR donate towards one of my NEW designs, yet to be revealed, and get first dibs on what I bring back. SCORE!!</li>
<li>People who donate will have first choice of limited edition designs, new designs, and be able to order their items with custom colors or measurements- all for LOWER PRICES. This will NOT be available to anyone else! The more you donate, the better deal you get!</li>
<li>Your feedback will help me get a better idea of what people want and I produce accordingly.</li>
<li>I will produce clothing according to the money I raise. The more, the better!  The funds will then multiply and turn into the income I live on. If I meet or exceed my goal, I can independantly fund my new album.</li>
<li>Use the various perks creatively to get anything you want, especially the higher levels. All of my deisgns don't fit into 12 catergories! I am willing to work with you to make sure you are one happy camper.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p>I also want to involve you in my journey. Follow me as I take you fabric shopping, post music videos I make, work with my tailors, and explore the amazing magic of Bali. This will be a fun way for us to get to know each other better and for you to see who I am, what I do and how I do it. Part of my intention is to empower other artists to also have the freedom to realize their dreams, and I believe sharing my own process is a valuable step. Together we are powerful! Crowd funding is a powerful tool that can bring us closer to each other no matter where we are on the planet.</p>
<p>I have already completed a successful KickStarter campaign for my Music Video, ""The Amazing Birthday song,"" an uplifitng, soulful &amp; fun catchy little ditty meant to be an alternative to the boring old birthday song. It is a gift for all of us to be able to send online to our loved ones on thier special day, to help celebrate and remind them of who they truly are. This journey of the Kickstarter &amp; making the video allowed me to see the magic of what we can create together and I want to keep going! <br/>Please check out the ""Amaezing Birthday Song"" and spread the love!<br/><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSJT5o12Vzg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSJT5o12Vzg</a><br/> </p>

<p><b>MEET ENIANA: A MINIMALIST SPACIOUS</b><b> WALLET</b></p>
<p>The technological development of smart
gadgets made carrying around all that unnecessary stuff, like coins,
receipts and year-old loyalty cards a thing of the past. The next step was to
design a new concept of wallet for the modern, active person who hates
schlepping around all that unessential stuff.</p>
<p>Eniana wallet was created having exactly
this in mind - to be a super-thin, card-carrying over-achiever. Because we
believe that all you really need in your wallet are your essential cards and
cash.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/668515/files/20140623060848-_DSF1576.jpg?1403528928"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><i>10 credit cards + 3 x $20 bills + ID card inside Eniana wallet and a similar content with a regular wallet</i></p><p></p>
<p><b>WHY ENIANA IS BETTER: A WALLET DESIGNED
TO STRETCH</b><br/>
We observed that many of today's minimal wallets fail because the material
stretches out leaving it unable to hold a smaller number of cards. The beauty
of our durable, leather-elastic design is that Eniana stretches and wraps
tightly around your cards but still having a classy leather design. Whether you
carry 10 or 20 cards one week and then 2 cards for the weekend, Eniana will
never stretch out or lose its ability to grip your cards or cash, and will make
you look stylish in any situation.</p><p></p><p><i>Eniana wallet with 8 credit cards + 1 ID card + 2 business cards + 2 x $20 bills + 5 coins</i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/668828/files/20140623080344-_DSF1685.jpg?1403535824"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/668550/files/20140623061701-06-Collages18.jpg?1403529421"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>

<p>Video games were <em>the cornerstone</em> of my childhood! Even now, over a decade later, just thinking about playing Bubble Bobble or Super Mario brings back that warm, fuzzy feeling that only nostalgia can produce. Every so often I find myself pulling out the Nintendo and settling in for a long night of nostalgia.</p>
<p><strong>What does my pledge go towards?</strong></p>
<p>This project is to order additional supplies for larger-scale production. My initial investment in the glitter suspension nail polish base, glitter, empty bottles, and other various supplies for very small-scale production was over $100 out-of-pocket. For larger-scale production I can't afford the $300+ out-of-pocket. Your contribution <em>will</em> make a difference! Every bit helps :-)</p>
<p><strong>What other collections are you planning?</strong></p>
<p>I already have 5 collections planned and awaiting prototyping:</p>
<ul>
<li>Harry Potter</li>
<li>Doctor Who</li>
<li>Lord of the Rings</li>
<li>Invader Zim</li>

<h1>Chapter 2 – History of Trash Amps</h1>
<div>
<p>In college, our friend got an Altoids guitar amp kit online. It was a cool idea, but it didn’t sound great because it’s such a small enclosure.  The same electronics worked great in a soda can. Then came the realization: you can put music in anything – Trash Amps was born.  After showing a few prototypes to friends, we knew there was a market for a product like this.  Adam graduated in 2009 (Manufacturing Engineering) and joined forces with Ron (Electrical Engineer) to get Trash Amps going.</p>
<p>After a small run of Gen 0, which utilized PVC pipe and off the shelf parts, we wanted to up the level of quality.  We raised money from family and friends for an injection mold – we wish we would have known about Indiegogo then!  We built 500 Gen 1 Trash Amps, which quickly sold through our website and booth at the local mall for $50 each. So, we made 1000 more.  We’re talking 1,500 units made by hand on the dining room table.  In Sept 2012, we sold the last Trash Amp Gen 1!</p>
</div>

<p>As the Gen 1 phase of our project ends, we are anxious to start the next: we are ready to bring out Gen 2!</p>

<p>Here are a few emails we received from customers who purchased Gen 1:</p>
<h3>Joyce from Phoenix, Arizona writes:</h3>
<p><em>""This is a truly awesome product, I have now bought 5 of them online. These are awesome and affordable gifts!"" </em> </p>
<h3>Debbie ""Librarian"" from San Francisco, California writes:</h3>
<p><em>""I just want to tell you how much I love my amp. I bought it at the Makers Fair in San Mateo, CA and I use it with my electric ukulele. I am a librarian at a middle school and I am spreading the word! When the students come into the library they are amazed how good it sounds!!! Thank you until the end of time and beyond!""</em></p>
<h3>Brad from Queensland, Australia writes:</h3>
<p><em>""I found out about Trash Amps from a Tumblr Blog I follow. My Trash Amp arrived yesterday and I love it. It's perfect to listen to tunes without having to pop in some ear phones when I sit down and read a book. Sometime over the weekend it'll get a test run on my brothers Bass guitar. I'll see if I can't convince him to get his own Trash Amp to practice with to avoid annoying the neighbourhood all the time. Would love to stay in touch, and if I find myself back in the US again, I'm looking you up and we're going for beers and pizza. And you've got a place to stay in Australia too if you come down here on holiday.""</em></p>
<h3>Tony ""Mad About Portable Music"" from San Jose, California writes:</h3>
<p><em>""Shweeeet Product!!! Caught you gents at a local gift faire in San Jose! Watched and listened to a few people ask very specific questions, and then bought one myself. Having tried many MP3 portable speakers in the past, I was a little skeptical, but plugged my ipod shuffle in, and of course pumped up the volume...and I was friggin amazed! Nice device! Having an art background, I was dually impressed with the packaging, especially the cardboard tube. I definitely like the concept of old stuff turned into something new and useful. Well done guys. I'll be sending many friends and family your way!""</em></p>
<h3>Jorge from Miami, Florida writes:</h3>
<p><em>""I remember watching your video about a year ago and thinking how amazing your Trash Amp was. Since I didn't have a job, I couldn't afford it. But two things happened a week ago: my headphones broke, and I just got a job! SO, I thought about this awesome speaker that fits in a can and decided to buy one because of it's ingenuity and amazing purpose. I received the speaker in the mail yesterday, I absolutely love it! I'm using it for iPod and Guitar, and I still use the packaging as a case. I love that concept of a travel case that lives past it's shipping life. Thanks for inventing this awesome device!""</em></p>

<p><span>During the course of selling 1,500 Gen 1 Trash Amp Speakers, our customers gave us these three ideas to improve Gen 2.</span></p>
<p>We’ve addressed all of these issues in Gen 2. Other improvements include a more durable cord, automatic on/off, and automatic gain control.  In chapter 4, we’ll give you all the details on Gen 2, which you can pre-order by pledging $32 or more (see Chapter 1 - Rewards)!</p>

<h1>Chapter 6 – Manufacturing Plan</h1>
<p>We’ve completed the design work for the electronics, product and packaging in Sunnyvale, CA. We're working with a reputable turnkey manufacturing company in Oregon that employs more than 100 people in the US full time. Using our prototypes and manufacturing documents, they will produce 1000 units at their China manufacturing location.</p>
<p>We've looked for the past year, but never found anybody to build our product in the USA - unfortunately, it seems most products involving electronics are made overseas these days.  If you know of turnkey manufacturing in the USA for our speakers, please contact: <a href=""mailto:info@trashamps.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">info@trashamps.com</a> - we would love to build it here if posssible!</p>
<p>We have given the manufacturer all of the documents required for production, as well as physical working prototypes of our product. The manufacturer has already sent us first articles (initial sample from manufacturer). Overall, the samples looked very good. We have analyzed these product samples and given feedback. They are now building final product samples which we should receive in early November. We will keep you posted on how they look. If you have any questions about our manufacturing plan or experience, please contact us! We love talking about manufacturing – it’s our passion!</p>
<p>We’ve put a ton of effort into earth friendly product design and packaging. Many of the parts are made from recycled materials, such as the black plastic end caps. Our manufacturer will use “regrind” plastic for many plastic parts in the product and packaging. Regrind plastic is plastic that would normally be thrown away, but is ground up and used again for our product.</p>
<p>The following items will be produced by our contract manufacturer: Indiegogo can, speaker insert, and packaging.</p>
<p><img alt=""Made via contract manufacturing"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s14.postimage.org/z0vjkr5pd/indie_05.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span><span>Due to the range of colors and designs of our magnetic grills, and the fact that we have an Epilog laser cutter, we will produce the grills ourselves. With injection molding, we wouldn’t be able to experiment with new designs, nor would we be able to produce small quantities of a variety of different colors. With laser cutting, we have complete control over color, design, and quantity. Plus, it’s fun to use the laser. After the campaign, we will purchase the acrylic sheets locally and start laser cutting. After they are cut out, we will glue on the magnet and send them with your speaker!</span></span></p>
<p><img alt=""How Trash Amps makes grills"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s14.postimage.org/qwnfg0ja9/indie_06.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span>We still provide cans that have been consumed and collected in Sunnyvale, California, USA! We collect them from all sorts of folks, mostly family and friends. We clean them, cut the tops off, and make sure there are no sharp edges. When the speakers arrive, we will combine it with the can you select. We have more than 1000 cans saved up, check it out:</span></p>
<p><img alt=""Boxes of Cans"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s14.postimage.org/uhnwczd7l/indie_07.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span><span>We made a special wall organizer for the cans. This custom design includes laser cut cardboard from old boxes. This can organizer is special because a soda can may be added or removed anywhere on the board without disrupting the other cans.</span></span></p>

<h1>Chapter 8 – We’ve Got Credentials</h1>
<p>We’ve worked on projects such as towel warmers and LED disc golf discs. We are skilled in woodworking, injection molding, CNC machining, solid modeling, rapid prototyping, electronic design and assembly, and the list goes on. We do a lot of consulting for local inventors with new product ideas, helping turn their ideas into working prototypes. Our current side project is a medical device for paramedics to use in the field. Got a project for us? Drop us a line!</p>
<p>Adam has a BS in Manufacturing Engineering from California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) in San Luis Obispo, CA. Ron has a BS in General Engineering and MS in Industrial Engineering also from Cal Poly. Having worked on many projects together, workflow is efficient. Adam typically does the product design, packaging design, and SolidWorks 3D Modeling. Ron specializes in electronics, circuit design, and prototype PCB creation.</p>
<p>Adam completed all of the product design for Gen 2. This includes SolidWorks 3D modeling, prototyping, testing, and technical drawings – everything the manufacturer needs to make the product. Adam also completed the same items for the packaging.</p>
<p><img alt=""Adam's work"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s14.postimage.org/uk7rztgv5/indie_09.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span>Ron has completed all of the electronics design. This includes circuit design, schematic creation, circuit testing and optimization using software, component library creation, board layout, prototype creation, testing and optimization of real prototypes, and creation of manufacturing documents including pick and place data, board panelization, etc. For you tech people, Ron is a very skilled PCB prototype maker, as he can put down parts as small as 0402 in the garage.</span></p>

<h1>Chapter 10 – Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p><strong>1. Can I choose my own soda can and grill top? </strong>Yes! Please pledge to a perk which includes “Can &amp; Grill chosen by YOU”. After pledging, go to our website to reserve the can(s) and grill(s) of your choice: <a href=""http://www.can-reservation.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.can-reservation.com</a>. Limit one can and one grill reservation per CAN combo. Get your favorite can before somebody else does!</p>
<p><strong>2. How loud is it? </strong>Ridiculously loud! Seriously, it will fill a large apartment or your bedroom. It’s even great for outdoor use, like backyard BBQs and beach days.  People are always surprised at how loud our speakers are!</p>
<p><strong>3. How do you turn the speaker on? </strong>Trash Amps Gen 2 is SMART: it automatically turns on when music plays, and falls asleep after 30 seconds of silence. Alternatively, if you unplug the Trash Amp from your device, it automatically turns off. This really prolongs your battery life – you can’t forget to turn this speaker off and waste the batteries (user feedback from Gen 1). </p>
<p><strong>4. How do you control the volume of the speaker? </strong>The volume of the speaker is controlled by the device you plug in – turn it up on your iPod or guitar, and the speaker gets louder. Using input impedance sensing, aka “magic,” the Trash Amp automatically boosts the gain for face melting guitar solos! </p>
<p><strong>5. Will the Trash Amp work with my device? </strong>A simple rule of thumb is “if you can plug in headphones, you can plug in a Trash Amp!” Devices commonly used are smart phones, iPod, iPad, tablets, mp3 players, laptops, portable DVD players, and the list goes on. And don’t forget about musical instruments, like electric guitars (see next item)! </p>
<p><strong>6. How do I use the Trash Amp with my guitar or other musical instrument? </strong>Trash Amp is a legit guitar amplifier! We’ve seen Trash Amps used with electric guitars, electric ukuleles and keyboards. Use the ¼” adapter to plug into any standard instrument output. We include one adapter free with every CAN Combo! </p>
<p><strong>7. Can I use my own cord with the Trash Amp? </strong>Yes, the 3.5mm auxiliary jack inside the secret compartment allows you to use your own cord to connect an input. The built-in cord is 15 inches long, so especially with guitar use, it can be nice to have a longer cord so you can move around freely. </p>
<p><strong>8. Can I connect multiple Trash Amps together for stereo sound or louder volumes? </strong>The built in 3.5mm auxiliary jack allows you to connect Trash Amps together! Just plug the first unit into your device, and plug subsequent Trash Amps into the previous unit’s auxiliary jack. This lets you get even louder volumes!</p>
<p><strong>9. Can I get stereo sound out of my Trash Amps? </strong>True stereo sound can be achieved using a stereo splitter between the audio source and the two Trash Amps. You can pick one up at your local electronics store.  By default, Trash Amps internally mix the left and right audio signals together, so when you daisy chain two or more together using the auxiliary jack, they each with play the mixed mono signal.</p>
<p><strong>10. Can you give me some technical specs on these speakers? </strong>Trash Amps are super efficient with power consumption, offering 50 hours of battery life from 4 AA batteries (included). A 2"" full range driver and 1.4W amp provide ridiculously loud music for a hangout with friends, or for an impromptu jam session. </p>
<p><strong>11. How do you cut the cans? </strong>Over the past 5 years, we’ve developed a device to safely cut the tops off the cans. Cutting cans is very difficult because they are so delicate. You want an even cut with no sharp edges. We’d love to share our method with you, but then we’d have to kill you! Just kidding… maybe someday we’ll tell, but we want you to have the chance to think through the challenge yourself! Brain exercise, a real engineering problem! </p>
<p><strong>12. Can I cut my own can?</strong> It is possible to cut a can with scissors or other tools, but please don’t kill yourself! For liability and safety reasons, “we don’t recommend it.” We include a pre-cut can with every CAN Combo so you get a straight, clean top without sharp edges. </p>
<p><strong>13. Where do the cans come from?</strong> We’ve collected cans for the past 4 years from all over the world. We have more than 1000 cans in our house, and it’s getting to be a problem. I have many “regular drinkers” that save cans for me, like my grandparents. When we go to parties, we collect the cans and take them home with us. If you live in the Bay Area and you drink lots of canned beverages, please contact us (info@trashamps.com) about becoming a can supplier! The Indiegogo Can is recycled aluminum branded with exclusive graphics – to be clear, it never had soda in it. Custom printed cans like this are becoming very popular for us because people want branding and customizability options.</p>
<p><strong>14. Do you need a can on the speaker to use it? </strong>The can creates a sealed speaker cavity for a full range sound experience. Without it, the frequency response is greatly diminished. Plus the can gives you style points! </p>
<p><strong>15. Where is it made? </strong>We’ve completed the design work for the electronics, product and packaging in Sunnyvale, CA. We're working with a reputable turnkey manufacturing company in Oregon that employs more than 100 people in the US full time!  Using our prototypes and manufacturing documents, they will produce 1000 units at their China manufacturing location.</p>
<p><strong>16. Can you make it in the USA? </strong>In the past 2 years, we hand made and sold 1,500 units for $50 each. These units were built on the dining room table, and to date, nobody has been paid a salary :-(  We've looked for the past year, but never found anybody who could produce our product in the USA - unfortunately, most products involving electronics are made overseas these days.  If you know of turnkey manufacturing in the USA for our speakers, please contact: <a href=""mailto:info@trashamps.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">info@trashamps.com</a> - we would love to build it here if possible!  For now, we've made a decision and we're going to give it a try.  With the help of professional manufacturing, we will build a thriving business, create new jobs, and start paying salaries!</p>
<p><strong>17. Is shipping included? </strong>Shipping is included for US orders.  International orders, please add $10 to your pledge.</p>
<p><strong>18. When will I get my Trash Amp? </strong>If everything goes according to plan, you will have your speakers in hand by February 28, 2013. Of course, stay tuned for backer updates including delivery dates!</p>
<p><strong>19. Is Coke going to sue you for using their cans? </strong>People trade and sell collectors Coke cans on eBay, right? Is that illegal? The answer is no. After some research, we’ve found the rule on selling cans: “you may sell a can as long as there’s nothing in it.” So Trash Amps has created a Speaker Insert which fits inside cans, and we also sell empty cans which you can use to customize your speaker. When our website is in normal operation, the Speaker Insert and can show up as separate items during checkout, eliminating the idea that Coke may have made the speaker. This solution overcomes licensing issues and is an integral part of the Trash Amps Patent. </p>
<p><strong>20. Do you have a patent?</strong> In September 2010, we filed a utility patent application for the Trash Amps Speaker. In September 2012, we got our first office action, and soon the patent will be granted. It’s always good to have some protection, and filing the patent was a great learning experience! Look for “Patent Pending” or Patent No. on the product when you get it! </p>
<p><strong>21. Can I purchase Trash Amps in bulk for my store? </strong>Our Indiegogo campaign is geared toward everyday folks.  The maximum quantity you can purchase through our campaign is 12 units. We’d love to talk more about wholesale possibilities with you via email, please drop us a line: info@trashamps.com. </p>
<p><strong>22. Can I brand Trash Amps with my school or company logo? </strong>Yes, but it’s not available through our Indiegogo campaign. Please drop us a line: info@trashamps.com. </p>
<p><strong>23. Why don’t you use rechargeable batteries? </strong>Many people ask us this, because we’re a “green company” and “disposable batteries are evil.” In an effort to make the product affordable to all, we’ve designed it with a 4AA battery pack which comes with 4 AA Alkaline batteries. Many customers purchase their own rechargeable batteries and charger – it’s an option for those that want it! </p>
<p><strong>24. Why don’t you use solar panels?</strong> Many people ask us this, because we’re a “green company.” To the best of our knowledge, a reasonably sized solar panel would not provide the amount of current required to power our speakers. To get the proper amount of power, you’d need a solar panel 5ft X 5ft – you lose the entire “PORTABLE” aspect of our product. Not to mention the two main requests we get from customers are: (1) can you make it louder? and (2) can you lower the price point? Adding solar panels to the mix would create power problems and increase the price point.</p>
<p><strong>25. Do Trash Amps support Bluetooth? </strong>The biggest complaint we’ve had thus far is “the price is too high!” We thought about adding Bluetooth, but it adds cost, which adds to our price point problem. Our target market is high school and college students, and our price point must be appropriate for this audience. With the current product, we’ve gone for a durable, simple product that everyone can afford. BUT, if this project is successful, I promise you here and now: we will do another campaign in the future for a Bluetooth Trash Amp Speaker! </p>
<p>If you read this far, you deserve a medal of honor. Thanks for your interest in our project!</p>

Chapter 2 – History of Trash Amps

In college, our friend got an Altoids guitar amp kit online. It was a cool idea, but it didn’t sound great because it’s such a small enclosure.  The same electronics worked great in a soda can. Then came the realization: you can put music in anything – Trash Amps was born.  After showing a few prototypes to friends, we knew there was a market for a product like this.  Adam graduated in 2009 (Manufacturing Engineering) and joined forces with Ron (Electrical Engineer) to get Trash Amps going.
After a small run of Gen 0, which utilized PVC pipe and off the shelf parts, we wanted to up the level of quality.  We raised money from family and friends for an injection mold – we wish we would have known about Indiegogo then!  We built 500 Gen 1 Trash Amps, which quickly sold through our website and booth at the local mall for $50 each. So, we made 1000 more.  We’re talking 1,500 units made by hand on the dining room table.  In Sept 2012, we sold the last Trash Amp Gen 1!


As the Gen 1 phase of our project ends, we are anxious to start the next: we are ready to bring out Gen 2!

Chapter 3 – Customer Feedback: Gen 1

Here are a few emails we received from customers who purchased Gen 1:
Joyce from Phoenix, Arizona writes:
""This is a truly awesome product, I have now bought 5 of them online. These are awesome and affordable gifts!""  
Debbie ""Librarian"" from San Francisco, California writes:
""I just want to tell you how much I love my amp. I bought it at the Makers Fair in San Mateo, CA and I use it with my electric ukulele. I am a librarian at a middle school and I am spreading the word! When the students come into the library they are amazed how good it sounds!!! Thank you until the end of time and beyond!""
Brad from Queensland, Australia writes:
""I found out about Trash Amps from a Tumblr Blog I follow. My Trash Amp arrived yesterday and I love it. It's perfect to listen to tunes without having to pop in some ear phones when I sit down and read a book. Sometime over the weekend it'll get a test run on my brothers Bass guitar. I'll see if I can't convince him to get his own Trash Amp to practice with to avoid annoying the neighbourhood all the time. Would love to stay in touch, and if I find myself back in the US again, I'm looking you up and we're going for beers and pizza. And you've got a place to stay in Australia too if you come down here on holiday.""
Tony ""Mad About Portable Music"" from San Jose, California writes:
""Shweeeet Product!!! Caught you gents at a local gift faire in San Jose! Watched and listened to a few people ask very specific questions, and then bought one myself. Having tried many MP3 portable speakers in the past, I was a little skeptical, but plugged my ipod shuffle in, and of course pumped up the volume...and I was friggin amazed! Nice device! Having an art background, I was dually impressed with the packaging, especially the cardboard tube. I definitely like the concept of old stuff turned into something new and useful. Well done guys. I'll be sending many friends and family your way!""
Jorge from Miami, Florida writes:
""I remember watching your video about a year ago and thinking how amazing your Trash Amp was. Since I didn't have a job, I couldn't afford it. But two things happened a week ago: my headphones broke, and I just got a job! SO, I thought about this awesome speaker that fits in a can and decided to buy one because of it's ingenuity and amazing purpose. I received the speaker in the mail yesterday, I absolutely love it! I'm using it for iPod and Guitar, and I still use the packaging as a case. I love that concept of a travel case that lives past it's shipping life. Thanks for inventing this awesome device!""


During the course of selling 1,500 Gen 1 Trash Amp Speakers, our customers gave us these three ideas to improve Gen 2.
We’ve addressed all of these issues in Gen 2. Other improvements include a more durable cord, automatic on/off, and automatic gain control.  In chapter 4, we’ll give you all the details on Gen 2, which you can pre-order by pledging $32 or more (see Chapter 1 - Rewards)!

Chapter 6 – Manufacturing Plan
We’ve completed the design work for the electronics, product and packaging in Sunnyvale, CA. We're working with a reputable turnkey manufacturing company in Oregon that employs more than 100 people in the US full time. Using our prototypes and manufacturing documents, they will produce 1000 units at their China manufacturing location.
We've looked for the past year, but never found anybody to build our product in the USA - unfortunately, it seems most products involving electronics are made overseas these days.  If you know of turnkey manufacturing in the USA for our speakers, please contact: info@trashamps.com - we would love to build it here if posssible!
We have given the manufacturer all of the documents required for production, as well as physical working prototypes of our product. The manufacturer has already sent us first articles (initial sample from manufacturer). Overall, the samples looked very good. We have analyzed these product samples and given feedback. They are now building final product samples which we should receive in early November. We will keep you posted on how they look. If you have any questions about our manufacturing plan or experience, please contact us! We love talking about manufacturing – it’s our passion!
We’ve put a ton of effort into earth friendly product design and packaging. Many of the parts are made from recycled materials, such as the black plastic end caps. Our manufacturer will use “regrind” plastic for many plastic parts in the product and packaging. Regrind plastic is plastic that would normally be thrown away, but is ground up and used again for our product.
The following items will be produced by our contract manufacturer: Indiegogo can, speaker insert, and packaging.

Due to the range of colors and designs of our magnetic grills, and the fact that we have an Epilog laser cutter, we will produce the grills ourselves. With injection molding, we wouldn’t be able to experiment with new designs, nor would we be able to produce small quantities of a variety of different colors. With laser cutting, we have complete control over color, design, and quantity. Plus, it’s fun to use the laser. After the campaign, we will purchase the acrylic sheets locally and start laser cutting. After they are cut out, we will glue on the magnet and send them with your speaker!

We still provide cans that have been consumed and collected in Sunnyvale, California, USA! We collect them from all sorts of folks, mostly family and friends. We clean them, cut the tops off, and make sure there are no sharp edges. When the speakers arrive, we will combine it with the can you select. We have more than 1000 cans saved up, check it out:

We made a special wall organizer for the cans. This custom design includes laser cut cardboard from old boxes. This can organizer is special because a soda can may be added or removed anywhere on the board without disrupting the other cans.

Chapter 10 – Frequently Asked Questions
1. Can I choose my own soda can and grill top? Yes! Please pledge to a perk which includes “Can & Grill chosen by YOU”. After pledging, go to our website to reserve the can(s) and grill(s) of your choice: www.can-reservation.com. Limit one can and one grill reservation per CAN combo. Get your favorite can before somebody else does!
2. How loud is it? Ridiculously loud! Seriously, it will fill a large apartment or your bedroom. It’s even great for outdoor use, like backyard BBQs and beach days.  People are always surprised at how loud our speakers are!
3. How do you turn the speaker on? Trash Amps Gen 2 is SMART: it automatically turns on when music plays, and falls asleep after 30 seconds of silence. Alternatively, if you unplug the Trash Amp from your device, it automatically turns off. This really prolongs your battery life – you can’t forget to turn this speaker off and waste the batteries (user feedback from Gen 1). 
4. How do you control the volume of the speaker? The volume of the speaker is controlled by the device you plug in – turn it up on your iPod or guitar, and the speaker gets louder. Using input impedance sensing, aka “magic,” the Trash Amp automatically boosts the gain for face melting guitar solos! 
5. Will the Trash Amp work with my device? A simple rule of thumb is “if you can plug in headphones, you can plug in a Trash Amp!” Devices commonly used are smart phones, iPod, iPad, tablets, mp3 players, laptops, portable DVD players, and the list goes on. And don’t forget about musical instruments, like electric guitars (see next item)! 
6. How do I use the Trash Amp with my guitar or other musical instrument? Trash Amp is a legit guitar amplifier! We’ve seen Trash Amps used with electric guitars, electric ukuleles and keyboards. Use the ¼” adapter to plug into any standard instrument output. We include one adapter free with every CAN Combo! 
7. Can I use my own cord with the Trash Amp? Yes, the 3.5mm auxiliary jack inside the secret compartment allows you to use your own cord to connect an input. The built-in cord is 15 inches long, so especially with guitar use, it can be nice to have a longer cord so you can move around freely. 
8. Can I connect multiple Trash Amps together for stereo sound or louder volumes? The built in 3.5mm auxiliary jack allows you to connect Trash Amps together!

17. Is shipping included? Shipping is included for US orders.  International orders, please add $10 to your pledge.
18. When will I get my Trash Amp? If everything goes according to plan, you will have your speakers in hand by February 28, 2013. Of course, stay tuned for backer updates including delivery dates!
19. Is Coke going to sue you for using their cans? People trade and sell collectors Coke cans on eBay, right? Is that illegal? The answer is no. After some research, we’ve found the rule on selling cans: “you may sell a can as long as there’s nothing in it.” So Trash Amps has created a Speaker Insert which fits inside cans, and we also sell empty cans which you can use to customize your speaker.

Adding solar panels to the mix would create power problems and increase the price point.
25. Do Trash Amps support Bluetooth? The biggest complaint we’ve had thus far is “the price is too high!” We thought about adding Bluetooth, but it adds cost, which adds to our price point problem. Our target market is high school and college students, and our price point must be appropriate for this audience. With the current product, we’ve gone for a durable, simple product that everyone can afford. BUT, if this project is successful, I promise you here and now: we will do another campaign in the future for a Bluetooth Trash Amp Speaker!

We have created several new designs, which I have added photos of today. Please visit our gallery to view them. We have a supporter who is throwing us a product party in the posh neighborhood of Oakwood, so we can introduce our designs to the fashionistas! We still need your help to create a professional website, and invest in more items. I promise, we are a worthwhile investment!******** <br/></p><p>My name is Brit, and I run a small online vintage clothing business through Ebay called Sleeping Goose Vintage (cute story, which I am happy to share if you ask me). It is operated out of my small home office, and I usually make much less than $1000 a month, gross. I would make much more, if I had more money to invest in the business, which would allow me to give back more (see below for my commitment to my community). I specialize mainly in vintage lingerie, purses, hats, dresses, and jewelery, and find these items by consistently attending estate sales, auctions, flea markets, thrift stores, and hunting online for the best deals possible. Selling on Ebay can sometimes be very limiting, and I would love to have my own professional website created outside of Ebay where the possibilities are endless, and I can reach many more people.</p>
<p>Revival Vintage is something I came up with to describe my idea of turning vintage “trash” into treasure. Items like the vintage Elsa Schiaparelli hat and the vintage gloves are treasures by themselves, but there are items which are broken, torn, stained, and just flat-out ignored at estate sales and thrift stores by prospective buyers. I see these items as treasure…I see a vintage bag with a broken strap, and imagine replacing the strap with a vintage strand of pearls, and weaving a black satin ribbon through it. I would be purchasing every one of these items if I had the money to invest in them. And  I am not talking about “bedazzling”, either. I mean really giving these pieces the love they deserve, and adding artistic, creative touches to them to create something one-of-a-kind, vintage, and new all at the same time. Add vintage applique, fabrics, swag, bling, pearls, jewels, buttons, and other very high-quality one-of-a-kind items. There will be no two pieces alike. It’s a good way to stay green, and keep recycling millions of items while preserving history all at the same time. I’d like to specialize in <span class=""caps"">MOD</span>, hippie, pin-up-girl, rockabilly girl, and many more styles. High-fashion, couture, green, usable, unique…all things that will BE the business. I have such an eye for these things, and a creative mind. I have hundreds of ideas, but I need a means to start the business…I need workspace, supplies, and the means to make an initial investment in items that are just waiting for me in the tri-state area. I also need to hire someone to create a professional site, and one or two helping hands. I already have about 300 items that are potential revival candidates, but I need the right art to make them couture. I will have items to fit <span class=""caps"">EVERY</span> budget, because <span class=""caps"">EVERY</span> girl deserves a fashionable wardrobe.</p>
<p>The money contributed to my campaign will go towards a professionally-designed website, quality camera and lighting equipment, and some new inventory (when I say new, I mean vintage), as well as supplies to start “reviving” the fashions that defined decades past! Each item that we sell &amp; ship will come with a “story”, about what was used to make it, and the era it came from. <span class=""caps"">HELP</span> <span class=""caps"">SAVE</span> <span class=""caps"">FASHION</span> <span class=""caps"">HISTORY</span>! I can use <span class=""caps"">ANYTHING</span>! I am a small business, and a supporter of other small businesses. This is a great way for you to give back to the community by supporting a small business! Every little bit helps the economy more than you know!

937-414-5971</p></div>","***UPDATE 9/30/10*** Revival Vintage Couture is officially launched. We have created several new designs, which I have added photos of today. Please visit our gallery to view them. We have a supporter who is throwing us a product party in the posh neighborhood of Oakwood, so we can introduce our designs to the fashionistas! We still need your help to create a professional website, and invest in more items. I promise, we are a worthwhile investment!******** My name is Brit, and I run a small online vintage clothing business through Ebay called Sleeping Goose Vintage (cute story, which I am happy to share if you ask me). It is operated out of my small home office, and I usually make much less than $1000 a month, gross. I would make much more, if I had more money to invest in the business, which would allow me to give back more (see below for my commitment to my community). I specialize mainly in vintage lingerie, purses, hats, dresses, and jewelery, and find these items by consistently attending estate sales, auctions, flea markets, thrift stores, and hunting online for the best deals possible. Selling on Ebay can sometimes be very limiting, and I would love to have my own professional website created outside of Ebay where the possibilities are endless, and I can reach many more people.
Revival Vintage is something I came up with to describe my idea of turning vintage “trash” into treasure. Items like the vintage Elsa Schiaparelli hat and the vintage gloves are treasures by themselves, but there are items which are broken, torn, stained, and just flat-out ignored at estate sales and thrift stores by prospective buyers. I see these items as treasure…I see a vintage bag with a broken strap, and imagine replacing the strap with a vintage strand of pearls, and weaving a black satin ribbon through it. I would be purchasing every one of these items if I had the money to invest in them. And  I am not talking about “bedazzling”, either. I mean really giving these pieces the love they deserve, and adding artistic, creative touches to them to create something one-of-a-kind, vintage, and new all at the same time. Add vintage applique, fabrics, swag, bling, pearls, jewels, buttons, and other very high-quality one-of-a-kind items. There will be no two pieces alike. It’s a good way to stay green, and keep recycling millions of items while preserving history all at the same time. I’d like to specialize in MOD, hippie, pin-up-girl, rockabilly girl, and many more styles. High-fashion, couture, green, usable, unique…all things that will BE the business. I have such an eye for these things, and a creative mind. I have hundreds of ideas, but I need a means to start the business…I need workspace, supplies, and the means to make an initial investment in items that are just waiting for me in the tri-state area. I also need to hire someone to create a professional site, and one or two helping hands. I already have about 300 items that are potential revival candidates, but I need the right art to make them couture. I will have items to fit EVERY budget, because EVERY girl deserves a fashionable wardrobe.
The money contributed to my campaign will go towards a professionally-designed website, quality camera and lighting equipment, and some new inventory (when I say new, I mean vintage), as well as supplies to start “reviving” the fashions that defined decades past! Each item that we sell & ship will come with a “story”, about what was used to make it, and the era it came from. HELP SAVE FASHION HISTORY! I can use ANYTHING! I am a small business, and a supporter of other small businesses. This is a great way for you to give back to the community by supporting a small business! Every little bit helps the economy more than you know! I am a hard worker, and your dollars will be used appropriately!

<p>Designed with a thumb slide feature that lets you easily slide out what you need, it's about being minimal. The <strong>NU</strong> also comes in pop colours with a  matching Lanyard so it can mix and match and add color to your life. It also comes in classic and timeless black and white. </p>

<p>• <strong>Tooling and Jigs</strong>. We need to commission and pay for tooling and jigs for each of our <strong>NU </strong>Lifestyle Card Holder/Wallet models. </p>

<h1>Production Timeline</h1>
<p>We have all of our China manufacturing partners lined up. This means that once we receive the funds we are able to right away begin producing the tooling and production jigs for our <strong>NU </strong>Lifestyle Card Holder/Wallet range.  Tooling and debugging will take approximately 6 weeks and production and despatch a further 6 weeks.  We therefore expect to start shipping towards late October 2013. We want to start simplifying your life by getting our <strong>NU</strong> Lifestyle Card Holder/Wallets in your pockets as soon as possible and we will make every effort to do so!</p>

<h2 class=""dotty""><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>We are a bunch of experienced industrial designers/problem solvers that have been developing products for more than three decades. Our ethos is all about critical attention to detail, so we enjoyed spending time testing and prototyping our NU Card Holder/Wallets to make sure that all the issues and little details are resolved prior to going into production. This project has been more than three years in the making and we have lifecycle tested hundreds of prototypes in order to make sure that they can withstand the rigours of daily use. We now have the products finely tuned and ready for production.</p>
<p>We also have long term relationships (more than 10 years) with vendor partners in Shenzhen China so when we say we can deliver this product on time and to the very high standards we set and you expect, you can back us with confidence.</p>
<p>We also believe in being transparent and open with our supporters, so, in the unlikely event there is a little hiccup, then we have the experience and know-how to resolve it and keep everyone updated and informed.</p>

Risks & Challenges
We are a bunch of experienced industrial designers/problem solvers that have been developing products for more than three decades. Our ethos is all about critical attention to detail, so we enjoyed spending time testing and prototyping our NU Card Holder/Wallets to make sure that all the issues and little details are resolved prior to going into production. This project has been more than three years in the making and we have lifecycle tested hundreds of prototypes in order to make sure that they can withstand the rigours of daily use. We now have the products finely tuned and ready for production.
We also have long term relationships (more than 10 years) with vendor partners in Shenzhen China so when we say we can deliver this product on time and to the very high standards we set and you expect, you can back us with confidence.
We also believe in being transparent and open with our supporters, so, in the unlikely event there is a little hiccup, then we have the experience and know-how to resolve it and keep everyone updated and informed.",26.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p class=""normal"">I am taking my business to a higher level of production to build inventory, and to optimize my processes.  It is important to me because I love music, I love guitars, and I love having my own company.  I want this company to grow to what I dream it to be.</p>
<p class=""normal"">Contributors will allow me to make more efficient processes to take on more than one guitar at a time, and also allow me to get materials in larger quantities.  This ultimately would lower the materials cost by drastic amounts.  Materials are expensive, and that is why it is difficult for me to get upfront capital myself to purchase large quantities.</p>

<p class=""normal"">I would need $40,000 to take on my campaign.  This is a great start to taking the first step in the mass production stage.  The funding would go towards machines/tools to optimize my processes, and make my processes capable of handling more than 1 guitar at a time.  Another huge part of the funding would go towards materials to buy in bulk, and save money on materials.  This will help me to get guitars in the hands of guitarists all over the world.  If the entire goal isn’t met, funding could still be used similarly, but in a smaller amount.</p>

<p>Nuudii covers a multitude of sizes and boob shapes, however we realize that this technology doesn’t expand to all our fabulous sizes...yet. Nuudii allows a very flexible fit. Take a look at the size chart and reach out to us with any questions. </p>
<p>We strongly believe that women of all sizes should have access to our products. We aim to be fully inclusive by expanding our size offerings, and with your help we will be able to fund this must-be-done development.  </p>
<p>So Nuudii is <strong>not a bra,</strong> it's an experience. Look braless with a <strong><u>gentle lift </u>and if you’re lucky, <u>a little side boob</u></strong><u>.</u> It asks you to love your boobs as they are. Nuudii allows your girls to be themselves. </p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Nuudii System has been over 3 years in development and was created by 3 women from the fashion Industry who have been listening to the needs, challenges and experiences of women and their boobs! </p>
<p>We have developed and Patent Approved Nuudii, and with a Design Patent pending. </p>
<p>We found that by truly listening and involving women in the development process, we were able to engineer and design the best product. We aim to constantly evolve and expand our technology to include additional sizes so more women can have the Nuudii Experience. We are honored and excited to be here on Kickstarter, where we can connect directly with you (and your boobs! )</p>
<p>Boobs are wonderful , and complicated - just think about all sizes and shapes - and Bra Production is a highly complex industry - However, we created a 'never been done before' manufacturing process. We found an extraordinary partner in the US , that by working with Nuudii, is reviving a dying industry. This campaign will provide the much needed capital to fund the build out of our production lines, re-establish an industry and enable us to share Nuudii with women of throughout the world. </p>
<p>We created a duplicate factory line in our Design studio in Brooklyn, to ensure that our designer could develop Nuudii right alongside our wear testers and ensure that Nuudii could be easily recreated in a factory environment, (always a huge challenge for any industry is moving a prototype to a proper production environment ). </p>
<p>We have now successfully tested a production run in the factory. We have built the supply chain of our Eco Friendly packaging and set up fulfillment for seamless deliveries. We have planned with all of our partners to allot time for production to fulfill and deliver rewards. </p>
<p><strong>RISKS </strong></p>
<p>1. We want to make sure our customer expects a completely new experience. </p>
<p>Nuudii does not feel or perform like you are wearing a bra - It is important to understand that this is different, it is not a bra and not the same experience as a bra. </p>
<p>Nuudii has no hardware, fits different, with the feel and look of being braless.  </p>
<p>There is no constriction, it allows your real shape to remain, while it gently lifts and allows your boobs to move within Nuudii. Nuudii System does not mold your boobs and allows them be themselves. Wearing Nuudii may show side boob and some sheerness. </p>
<p>2) Sizing and how to guide our customers to order the right size. </p>
<p>Nuudii is a very flexible fit because of the stretch. We currently offer sizes Small, Medium and Large, which covers sizes 32B - 38DD. And Nuudii actually gets better with wear. We will expand sizes in the future when, with your help, we are able to fund this highly technical development process. </p>
<p>For sizing and fit questions we have specialists on our team to connect with, as well as offering Free shipping with in the USA. Contact info@nuudiisystem.com</p>
<p>3) Exchanges / Refunds</p>
<p>Please consider these details before you pledge.</p>
<p><strong>There are no refunds.</strong> We will make a 1 X time exchange for a different size. Free Shipping within the USA. This needs to be within 10 days of receiving your Nuudii - contact info@nuudiisystem if you need a different size. (Note - shipping charges both ways apply for International orders exchanges).</p>
<p><strong>Important for International Backers</strong> Local Duties, Taxes, and Fees: Some international backers will be subject to local customs import duties and taxes; these backers will be responsible for covering all of their local customs duties and taxes.</p>

</div></div>","The Xeric Evergraph Automatic - Inspired by the past, designed for the future.
Nothing withstands the test of time better than great design. Ideas come and go, and trends fade, but something well-crafted will leave its mark forever.

We've launched three successful crowdfunding campaigns prior to the Evergraph. Back in 2013 with the Xeriscope, 2015 with the Halograph, and 2016 with the Soloscope. Our backers are playing an important role in shaping the future of the watch industry and design.


 


The Evergraph features the workhorse Japanese Miyota 82S0 automatic movement, American Horween leather (or solid stainless steel straps), anti-reflective sapphire crystal, and Xeric's signature time display. Production will be limited to only 999 pieces per color. 


 

To bring the Evergraph Automatic to reality, we need to know that we're on the right track with support from like-minded people like you who take pride in standing out from the crowd.
Those who have supported our past three crowdfunding campaigns often tell us they're tired of pretentious watches that merely express status - or- boring watches with no personality.
We are finding new ways to offer affordable, limited edition mechanical watches to fill that void. The Evergraph Automatic is our most classic-yet-modern design to date.

<p style=""color: #818286; font-size: 13px; font-family: gisha;""><strong>A cover for your tongue to protect it from bitter medicine.</strong></p>
<p style=""font-family: gisha; font-size: 12.5px;"">The Tongue Cover is a patent-pending, revolutionary new product that acts as a disposable latex barrier between your tongue and bitter medicine. It covers &amp; effectively protects your tongue from the bitter taste of the liquid medicine, health drinks, herbal teas, vitamin solutions, or even distasteful pills – all of which are imperative for your health, but whose taste, until now, was impossible to avoid.</p>

<p style=""color: #a63b59; font-size: 16.5px; font-family: gisha;""><strong>Solving the Bitter Medicine Problem</strong></p>
<p style=""color: #818286; font-size: 13px; font-family: gisha;""><strong>There’s no real substitute</strong></p>
<p style=""font-family: gisha; font-size: 12.5px;"">Before now, there were hardly any options to shield yourself from the taste of bitter medicines or pills. There are ways for masking the taste or cleansing the palette after dosing, even though most people simply choose to drink water or other liquids to flush down the aftertaste of it.</p>
<p style=""font-family: gisha; font-size: 12.5px;"">Pharmaceutical companies, on the other hand, have spent a lot of time &amp; effort in making medicines more bearable by either sugar-coating pills, or mixing liquid medicines with more palatable solutions (like kids’ medicines or adult antibiotics). What they fail to do in the course of their multi-million-dollar research efforts is actually prevent you from tasting the medicine. Rather, these measures adversely increase the number of nonessential ingredients in your medicine.</p>
<p style=""color: #a63b59; font-size: 16.5px; font-family: gisha;""><strong>How it works </strong></p>
<p style=""color: #818286; font-size: 13px; font-family: gisha;""><strong>The Indiegogo campaign video posted above shows the instructions very clearly (from 1:30 to 2:05) on how to use the product</strong></p>
<p style=""font-family: gisha; font-size: 12.5px;""><span>From a functional standpoint, you can think of the Tongue Cover as a condom for the tongue. </span></p>
<p style=""font-family: gisha; font-size: 12.5px;""><span style=""font-size: 12.5px;"">Simply take the Tongue Cover and settle it on to your tongue, very much like the way you settle a “bubble gum” onto your tongue right before making a bubble.

<p style=""color: #818286; font-size: 13px; font-family: gisha;""><strong>Production challenges, Technical issues &amp; Economic viability</strong></p>
<p style=""font-family: gisha; font-size: 12.5px;"">It’s been a long year to get to this point. After going back and forth during technical consultations with well-respected polymer engineers in the industry as well as dentists and ENT specialists, we sorted out issues regarding the <em>right material</em> to be used in terms of oral usage, costs, moldability and of course, ease of availability.</p>
<p style=""font-family: gisha; font-size: 12.5px;"">Another ergonomic challenge was to make the Tongue Cover “easy to wear and discard”. Finally, finding the appropriate manufacturer with the right R&amp;D facilities, hospital-grade standards of disinfection and requisite prototyping skills was imperative.</p>
<p style=""font-family: gisha; font-size: 12.5px;"">What we need to do now is raise sufficient funds to achieve economies of scale (by means of mass production), which is critical to the “physical distribution” component of our marketing plan.</p>
<p style=""color: #a63b59; font-size: 16.5px; font-family: gisha;""><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p style=""color: #818286; font-size: 13px; font-family: gisha;""><strong>A Tongue Cover with every bottle of medicine</strong></p>
<p style=""font-family: gisha; font-size: 12.5px;"">With your help, our goal is to make Tongue Covers the standard. Once we begin retailing it in pharmacies, we expect eventually a few ""pharmaceutical"" manufacturers to get serious about it and start pre-packaging the Tongue Cover along with the bitter medicine bottles <em>by default</em>.</p>
<p style=""color: #a63b59; font-size: 16.5px; font-family: gisha;""><strong>Target market</strong></p>
<p style=""color: #818286; font-size: 13px; font-family: gisha;""><strong>Pharmacies, Doctors’ offices, Hospitals and Distributors </strong></p>
<p style=""font-family: gisha; font-size: 12.5px;"">We want to make Tongue Covers as accessible as condoms or band-aids, for example; make it ubiquitously available across pharmacies, doctors’ offices and hospitals.

<p style=""font-family: gisha; font-size: 12.5px;"">From a functional standpoint, you can think of the Tongue Cover as a “condom for the tongue”, since it works on a similar principle. It acts as a barrier between your tongue and unpleasant medicine, so you can take medicine without having to endure its bitter taste.</p>
<p style=""color: #818286; font-size: 13px; font-family: gisha;""><strong>Is this a patent-pending product?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-family: gisha; font-size: 12.5px;"">Yes.</p>

<p style=""font-family: gisha; font-size: 12.5px;"">Now that we have partnered with our supplier in China, we are currently raising money for our first production run. We plan to ship first batch of Tongue Covers in May 2013.</p>
<p style=""color: #818286; font-size: 13px; font-family: gisha;""><strong>What is the Tongue Cover made of?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-family: gisha; font-size: 12.5px;"">Latex.</p>
<p style=""color: #818286; font-size: 13px; font-family: gisha;""><strong>I’m allergic to latex, will you make Tongue Covers of other materials?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-family: gisha; font-size: 12.5px;"">We have considered alternative materials in addition to latex for later production iterations. If we are able to successfully raise the ideal amount of <strong style=""color: #a63b59;"">$125,000</strong>, we would place first priority on producing child-size Tongue Covers, and later diversify into alternative materials.</p>

<p style=""color: #818286; font-size: 13px; font-family: gisha;""><strong>How much will it cost?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-family: gisha; font-size: 12.5px;"">Low unit price is our top priority, to achieve mass adoption. The Tongue Cover would retail in pharmacies at a price range similar to condoms.</p>

<p style=""color: #818286; font-size: 13px; font-family: gisha;""><strong>Does this cover the entire tongue? Will I still taste anything?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-family: gisha; font-size: 12.5px;"">The Tongue Cover in itself is tasteless. But it does not shield the entire tongue per se. Covering the entire tongue is rather impractical, as the back extends into the throat.</p>
<p style=""font-family: gisha; font-size: 12.5px;"">The Tongue Cover shields your tongue from the visible portion of the tongue, i.e. taste buds that detect the sweet, sour, and salty taste of your drinks, thus leaving only the very back exposed. While you will still taste a tad as you swallow, the aftertaste of it would be DRASTICALLY reduced, making strong medicines much more palatable. Our prototyping tests show approximately 90% reduction in taste with usage of Tongue Cover.</p>
<p style=""color: #818286; font-size: 13px; font-family: gisha;""><strong>Isn’t the “bitter” part of the tongue in the back, where the Tongue Cover leaves the tongue </strong><strong>exposed?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-family: gisha; font-size: 12.5px;"">Technically, that is correct. But you may be surprised to learn that medicines are not necessarily “bitter” per se. That is not what makes their taste so unbearable. Rather, it is the blended flavor of sweet, sour and/or salty ingredients of the medicine that makes it “pungent” in taste, which is exactly what the Tongue Cover protects you from.</p>
<p style=""color: #818286; font-size: 13px; font-family: gisha;""><strong>Does the Tongue Cover come in kids’ or teen sizes?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-family: gisha; font-size: 12.5px;"">Not presently. The first production run is only for adult-sized tongue covers (18 years and above).</p>
<p style=""font-family: gisha; font-size: 12.5px;"">Children tongue sizes vary drastically with age, which poses a standardization problem, thus requiring larger investment.

<p style=""color: #818286; font-size: 13px; font-family: gisha;""><strong>Are there any similar products presently available in the market?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-family: gisha; font-size: 12.5px;"">Before now, there were hardly any options available to shield yourself from the taste of bitter medication. And there was certainly nothing like the Tongue Cover. This is a patent-pending product.</p>

<p style=""font-family: gisha; font-size: 12.5px;"">Our biggest priority remains low unit cost, which can only be achieved by mass producing the product, promoting it and making it widely available. Once we are able to successfully raise funds for our first production run, our prime focus will be on popularizing adult-sized tongue covers.

Conceptual design
 
What is a TONGUE COVER?
A cover for your tongue to protect it from bitter medicine.
The Tongue Cover is a patent-pending, revolutionary new product that acts as a disposable latex barrier between your tongue and bitter medicine. It covers & effectively protects your tongue from the bitter taste of the liquid medicine, health drinks, herbal teas, vitamin solutions, or even distasteful pills – all of which are imperative for your health, but whose taste, until now, was impossible to avoid.

Pre-production prototype
Solving the Bitter Medicine Problem
There’s no real substitute
Before now, there were hardly any options to shield yourself from the taste of bitter medicines or pills. There are ways for masking the taste or cleansing the palette after dosing, even though most people simply choose to drink water or other liquids to flush down the aftertaste of it.
Pharmaceutical companies, on the other hand, have spent a lot of time & effort in making medicines more bearable by either sugar-coating pills, or mixing liquid medicines with more palatable solutions (like kids’ medicines or adult antibiotics). What they fail to do in the course of their multi-million-dollar research efforts is actually prevent you from tasting the medicine. Rather, these measures adversely increase the number of nonessential ingredients in your medicine.
How it works 
The Indiegogo campaign video posted above shows the instructions very clearly (from 1:30 to 2:05) on how to use the product
From a functional standpoint, you can think of the Tongue Cover as a condom for the tongue. 
Simply take the Tongue Cover and settle it on to your tongue, very much like the way you settle a “bubble gum” onto your tongue right before making a bubble. Then drink your medicine as usual. The salty, sweet and sour areas of your tongue that are most sensitive to the pungent, blended flavor of the medicine are covered, so it goes down easy. And you don’t have to worry about the aftertaste of the medicine either! 
When you are done, simply remove and discard the Tongue Cover. We do not recommend reusing the Tongue Cover for hygiene and legal reasons.

Challenges addressed

Production challenges, Technical issues & Economic viability
It’s been a long year to get to this point. After going back and forth during technical consultations with well-respected polymer engineers in the industry as well as dentists and ENT specialists, we sorted out issues regarding the right material to be used in terms of oral usage, costs, moldability and of course, ease of availability.
Another ergonomic challenge was to make the Tongue Cover “easy to wear and discard”. Finally, finding the appropriate manufacturer with the right R&D facilities, hospital-grade standards of disinfection and requisite prototyping skills was imperative.
What we need to do now is raise sufficient funds to achieve economies of scale (by means of mass production), which is critical to the “physical distribution” component of our marketing plan.
Goal
A Tongue Cover with every bottle of medicine
With your help, our goal is to make Tongue Covers the standard. Once we begin retailing it in pharmacies, we expect eventually a few ""pharmaceutical"" manufacturers to get serious about it and start pre-packaging the Tongue Cover along with the bitter medicine bottles by default.
Target market
Pharmacies, Doctors’ offices, Hospitals and Distributors 
We want to make Tongue Covers as accessible as condoms or band-aids, for example; make it ubiquitously available across pharmacies, doctors’ offices and hospitals. In order for the product to be as easily accessible, however, we need to raise funds sufficient enough to attain economic viability.
Perks 
Every dollar counts
Right from the conceptual stage, we always knew that the key to the success of Tongue Cover would lie in mass user adoption, which can only be achieved with a realistically low price tag. We plan on selling Tongue Covers in pharmacies at prices similar to condoms, after the first production run. Moreover, once the pharmaceutical companies hop on the bandwagon, and begin considering it as a standard add-on for bitter medicines, the prices are only bound to further plummet. 

Right now, we’re offering our friends on Indiegogo a purposefully wide range of perks that would cater to people of all segments. Whether you have a family member who has to endure medicinal teas or herbal solutions from time to time, or a friend who simply can’t stand drinking medicines or stinking pills, or if you’re a distributor who foresees market opportunity in Tongue Cover - our perks on offer cater to everyone.

Background
About the inventor, and the idea
After having graduated M.B.A. (Masters in Business Administration) in International Business in 2009 in Phoenix, AZ, I was awarded the D.M.D. honor title (Delta Mu Delta), for academic excellence – the highest national academic recognition for a business administration student in the United States. I was then inducted as a “lifetime member” of the Greater Phoenix Chamber of Commerce. I completed BS in Business (Marketing) back in 2006, and was awarded the M.K.T. honor title (Mu Kappa Tau) – the only marketing honor title for an undergraduate business administration student in the United States. Although I was offered a scholarship to pursue a PhD program, I decided instead to opt for the entrepreneurial route, and flew down to Dubai, U.A.E. which is where my parents have long resided.
The idea came to life when my father (a scientist) took particular interest during a discussion of “problem-solving” inventions while attending a related seminar. While the media and tech fans usually focus more on incremental changes for the relatively newer technological inventions, I have always been an ardent supporter of bringing attention toward changes in those fields that still operate pretty much the same way they did during our great grandparents’ time.

I want women to know their strength. I want a cycling cap that says feminist when you flip it up & I think other folks might want one too while supporting a rad cause that supports women. You in?I haven't found this cap out in the world & I think it should exist. But instead of just making one for myself, why not get a bunch of them made? And use some of the profits to support a worthy cause? Who am I?My name is Sarah Rice and I work in speciality coffee, I used to be a librarian, I like to ride my bike. I am incredibly fortunate to have a vast community of strong women in my life, many of whom I met through the bike community in Washington, DC. Their support and encouragement is inspiring. The solidarity I feel when I am with other women gives me hope in a world where sexism and misogyny are still ever present. What's this all about?It started with me wanting a cycling cap that says ""feminist"" when you flip it up. Pretty simple. I haven't seen this cap. It doesn't seem too terribly difficult to make happen. I mentioned it to a few friends the day after Senator Elizabeth Warren was cut off from speaking during the attorney general confirmation hearings. One friend said, ""Yes! And put, 'she persisted' on the side!"" This got me thinking. What if I got this cap made? And people bought it? And I put some of the proceeds towards a cause that supports women?It's a pretty simple idea and I think I can do it. But I need your help. My initial goal is raise money for 150 caps. How much money is that? $4,500 will get us 150 custom caps with about $1500 to donate to a charitable organization. What cause will the money go toward?HER Resiliency Center in Washington, DC. ""HER Resiliency Center is a non-profit organization that helps vulnerable young women ages 18 to 25 with the support, skills, and resources they need to make positive decisions and thrive. Through mentoring, workshops, and the support of dedicated and highly trained staff, HER gives young women a path to independence and a better life.""How much for a dang cap?!$30 will get you a cap!

We wouldn't settle for anything less than the highest quality! The first of its kind, Groove ring is liquid poured which not only permanently bonds the two rings but enables its flawless design and detail. Just look at it--it's beautiful! There are no messy mold lines and leftover material commonly found on silicone and elastomer products.  4. Groove is low profile and beautiful: 


Our goal was to allow you to put your hand in your pocket without the ring grabbing the fabric. Groove is low profile with a slightly raised outer arch giving it a pronounced look without a pronounced feel.  5. Groove is Stylish but Rugged:Groove is in its element in the gym, office, job site or on an adventure. 
6.  Its Safe:
 7.  Groove has a KILLER warranty:      When you buy Groove you are in the family!  If it breaks for any reason, if you lose it, or even if you hate your color, we will replace it.  Our warranty is for 1 year but send us a story of how it saved your finger and we will replace for a lifetime! .Groove Original will initially come in Midnight Black, Storm Grey, & Moss Green with more colors coming by April 2016.    Groove Original is 8 mm wide or 5/16"". 


Groove Thin will initially come in Midnight Black, Light Silver, and Lilac Purple more colors coming by April 2016.  Groove Thin is 5.5 mm wide or just under 1/4"".

Packaging will be in a small reusable tin.  

We are planning on expanding sizes for both styles by May 2016.  Our main goal with the kickstarter campaign is to build a community of like minded, active people who are excited about design and the future of Groove.    We are seeking your investment, input, and conversation to help spread the word of how Groove ring will revolutionize the way the world wears rings.  We have BIG plans for Groove and we need your voice as we grow.  You are essential to Groove's future, helping propel Groove forward.   We have bootstrapped enough to produce the first aluminum soft mold but we have big plans for Groove which is where you come in. Your funding will not only help us pay for the final steel ""Hard Mold"" but will start the momentum on BIG plans we have for Groove. By you joining us on this journey, we will be able launch Groove to the next level of colors, sizes, material, and even technology.We see you as first adopters, movers and shakers for the world and we need your conversations, input and investment.Forever forward, you will shape our designs, choose our colors and test our beta products. We need you and that is why we are here. Support Groove and lets do this together.After many trial-and-error steps we solved it! We came up with the infinity grooves on the inside of the ring. This, coupled with the inverse radius and firmer material on the inner ring, makes Groove Ring® as comfortable as it gets.Late April 2015We now have the design that we want! The only catch is the mold is 3 times as expensive as a singular mold and only holds 1/3 of the sizes.  This meant to produce the same amount of rings per mold as originally planned, it was now going to cost 9 times the amount!  We debated, but we could not get over the superior quality of the new ring. It's perfect and you'll love yours!
 
Risks and challengesAt this point in our journey we have overcome a lot of the challenges. Mainly, in the design. It took extensive time to find a supplier for our unique idea, and we invested significantly in the two piece soft mold. This led us to work out a lot of the kinks to make this product the highest of quality and functionality. We do not foresee any major challenges for fulfilling our kickstarter commitments. Our largest challenge is one we hope to tackle with you, our kickstarter community. We desire to take Groove to the world in a big way and want your involvement in future Groove designs and products.",24.0,5,"1 Campaign

We have continually tested numerous materials and selected the ones that are exceptionally durable, breathable, water resistant and eco friendly.A lot of people feel that if you don't use leather, the quality may not be as good. This is far from the truth. We have spent a lot of time in research and testing to find the best leather alternatives.The footwear market is flooded with a lot of low quality shoes. With sub par construction, these shoes are non-durable, bad for us and our environment. We wanted to ensure Rungg clearly stands out. We take quality seriously. We get our materials tested for reliability at the International Testing Centre in Footwear Design & Development Institute (FDDI).  This underlines our commitment in providing world-class shoes to our customers.  Our lining is absolutely Super Dooper.  What is lining you ask?  It's the lovely stuff that goes inside the shoe, that grips your feet as a glove for a nice comfort sensation.  All the more reason for it to be kickass. We tested numerous linings from around the world and finally selected a partner in Italy that produces world class “leather-free” lining.   Our lining is tested for durability, permeability and abrasion.  It gets the Seal of Acceptance from APMA - American Podiatric Medical Association.At less than 8 oz per shoe, Rungg shoes are really light weight.

He gives us company, joy, and the constant reminder of what we stand for as a brand- Making cruelty-free shoes.Hand EmbroideryHand embroidery is one of the traditional art forms of India. Artisans express their creativity through threads and needles. Each shoe at Rungg is hand embroidered to perfection by them. It takes an artisan anywhere from 8 to 12 hours to embroider 1 pair! Great attention to detail and precision is required to handcraft each pair. The artisan has to work according to a preset pattern to ensure the embroidery lands exactly where we want it.As our embroidery is 100% handwork, each piece is different and unique. So each shoe you get is one of its kind.Shoe MakingCreation of each shoe requires hours of labor and hard work. From Cutting to Stitching to Lasting, everything is done by hand. Our artisans work with utmost precision to handcraft each pair. They take their time to complete every step and continually inspect the special craftsmanship. The manual process gives each pair its unique characteristics. We're getting ready to dress your shoes with beautiful details.  We're still putting the final touches, but here is a preview for one of our sole designs. Rungg all the way !!    Rungg Shoes are true to size. If your feet are wider then we suggest a size up.  We will send you a survey at the end of the campaign to find out your exact size and a tip on how to size.  If they don't fit - don't worry - we'll exchange them.  We're a Husband-Wife Duo who are extremely passionate in what we're creating and our mission.  This is a picture from our recent trip to Italy. We attended Lineapelle and MICAM - the Largest Fashion events for Footwear and also met our amazing Vegan material suppliers.  We absolutely enjoyed our daily doze of macchiato's and croissants.

Today we want to introduce you the second watch project by CONTEMPUS!This time we dig deeper, not wider. The collection is dedicated to the history and development of architecture throughout the years and ages, drawing its vibe from ancient artisan masonry, contemporary shapes, designer trends and architectural objects.We're the visionaries, and CONTEMPUS was born through studying and observing design marvels of the past. We see a beautiful thing, a stylish, functional gear, a monumental construction, a glorious memento of the past or a herald of progress — and want to imprint the feeling, to give it a corporeal body, to bring it into existence. Everything that catches our eye in designer and architectural areas is used in the creation of new designs.The central motives in the new CONTEMPUS watches are still the same — we make pure, minimal dials with a fresh, contemporary look that’s stripped of unnecessary details.With this new series, we want to find more wrists to adorn with CONTEMPUS! There are two different models available: Amfiteatro, with a 36 mm diameter dial and Kupolo, the more universal and larger model with a 42 mm dial.CONTEMPUS is always about seeking the most beautiful, stylish and ergonomically approved concepts for creating a designer object. We love design and architecture, and if you do too, then you'll definitely like our fresh series of timepieces!Are you ready to descend into a search for pure minimal shapes and forms embodied in a wristwatch? Do you seek a truly remarkable designer object that you can wear to add a spark of joy to your day? If the answer is yes, then let's continue :) The Dua series by CONTEMPUS features two different models in six colorways, in a regular unisex size, and also in more sophisticated ladies’ measurements. All you need is to pick the style and size you want to spoil your wrist with this exemplary designer object. The first model in the series is Kupolo — a unisex, universal timepiece that’s offering a convex dial structure with a more straightforward ergonomic shape, a reference to the latest architectural trends and up-to-date city line. The overall look of the Kupolo watch is based on and is a reference to the ever-changing design and architectural trends of contemporary craftsmanship, which tend to grow in height each generation, bringing humans closer to the skies, as well as turning modern minimal shapes into smooth aerodynamic objects. The domed structures are the point of interest here, created as a reference to the unnatural limit of how far each person and humanity can climb, the limit that we'll break one day :) The industrial beauty of the Kupolo watch is the result of inspiration from modern monumental structures. The second watch in the collection is Amfiteatro — debuting as the first CONTEMPUS watch crafted specifically for ladies in a sophisticated manner. The dial of Amfiteatro has a concave form traditional to the CONTEMPUS style.The rough and edgy shape is inspired by ancient Greek amphitheaters and concave areas that had a similar structure and physical properties. This way we commemorate the practical purpose of this ancient architecture that was discovered by humanity to serve its needs.    KUPOLO STALOThe first available special edition added to the initial line is the Kupolo Stalo unisex watch. This timepiece brings back the stylish cold monochrome look of our Stalo standard with a dial surface fully made of brushed stainless steel and smoke grey leather strap. This model serves as a reference to the practical side of designer and architectural craft that serves their purpose with moderate expressions. The Kupolo Stalo watch can be included in any multiple reward as well. AMFITEATRO ORAThe second special edition is the reworked version of our feminine Amfiteatro model in Ora colorway. This version bears the unique blend of antique patina with a golden case color to support the connection to the days long gone. A bright crimson strap turns it into a worthy contemporary timepiece for ladies with good taste. The model is also available as a standalone reward or in a multiple bundle.Interested in learning more about the new CONTEMPUS series?  As we planned from the beginning, each watch series by CONTEMPUS is not merely a physical product, but also a study of the ever-changing nature of architecture and design. This time is no different.For a moment, close your eyes, gather your thoughts and imagine how the architectural landscape has changed through the years. From bold structures and a low line, the cities grew, and cozy buildings turned into skyscrapers, forging the contemporary industrial look.This collection reflects the changes in a sophisticated architectural landscape throughout the past thousands of years of humanity’s creativity. From ancient monumental structures to futuristic constructions born from continual progress. Preserving the uniqueness of the landscape with artisan features and unique traits, given to it by people, who bring a spark of life to the object with their own vision and character.For example, the idea to give more color to Amfiteatro, contrary to our usual palette and designs, was born during our transition to Amsterdam — the city in the Netherlands with a rich architectural heritage and history.The colorful streets full of classic houses and buildings serve not only as a tourist magnet, but they also show just what attracts us so much in good old-fashioned creativity — that such individually characteristic objects can last throughout the years without losing their initial purpose. A design that will survive over decades — that's what we're aiming to create.Color. Minimalism. Ergonomics. Traditions. Progress. That's quite enough perks to describe what inspired us for this series. Each model will take you closer to the integrity of creative vibes, assembled into something solid to represent our take on pure design.Now that you’re acquainted with our concept, vision, philosophy and both new models, let’s view them in detail. Here at CONTEMPUS, we have two simple rules: stay minimal, and the design is everything. Each collection involves a challenge to enhance the concept we chose, to extend our philosophy beyond a simple designer object. Having signature design motifs in the CONTEMPUS product line, we always try to add nice details and design features to make all design enthusiasts worldwide find something they’ll love and to stand out among the others. The new designs offer a wide variety of strap colorways, in a purposeful color selection, that perfectly work with each other. We conducted research to get the perfect color combinations, being guided by history's most notable examples. Even small details such as color coordination matters to CONTEMPUS!Each watch is traditionally named in the Esperanto language, referring to the structure it’s inspired by — Amfiteatro means “amphitheater” and Kupolo means “dome.” The colorways are traditionally called Nokte and Nego for black and white models, subsequently adding Ora and Stalo, meaning “golden"" and ""steel"" to the list.The watch case has been polished to perfection and offers a slim construction that's so light-weight, sometimes you may wonder if the watch accidentally slipped off your wrist! The ladies' version offers even more exquisite elegance with its finer measurements.  The dial of the Kupolo watch leaves no space for smooth edges. Being topped on the flat surface, it serves as a reference to a modern skyline and the tendency to grow a city toward the clouds.  We decided to stay true to watchmaking traditions and offer easily readable, two-handed dials, stressing the design itself. The Amfiteatro model features a universal clear dial with a concave center, a nod to ancient Greek and Roman structures.So it's up to you to choose your favorite style! Want to know how we did it? This is our second series, so we were confident in resuming the research process, seeking the ultimate design. Our new attempt is the next step for our concept, deriving from the architectural motives of the first series. We tried tons of different variations depicting the monumental might and ergonomics of iconic architecture types in the form of a minimalist, universal watch that will suit every wrist on every occasion. Not the simplest thing to do. But we think we’re moving in the right direction!This time we decided to leave no wrist untouched and went for men’s and women’s styles. Another difficult choice was finding the perfect colorways for our new series. We had a lot of discussions about the most fitting options, deciding finally to keep the initial ""Esperanto"" black and white colors, while adding new extravaganza colorways to the line. The Kupolo model offers a choice of vintage-inspired straps. The Amfiteatro model has the more contemporary color options.    Besides the design, we're happy to support it with an affordable price, too. Our primary goal is to bring each CONTEMPUS watch to life and make as many people happy with the new pieces as we can. That's why we offer such an attractive price on any CONTEMPUS timepiece, which is only $95 USD! There are several factors that affect the price.With no retail margin at all, you'll get your watches directly from the manufacturer, avoiding any middlemen and their commissions on the way to your wrist. We’re also transparent and honest about our production costs. There’s a graph below showing how we can achieve such an affordable price, including every stage of manufacturing and every piece of the watch itself, as well as company profit.Below is a graph showing the estimated production period — from the crowdfunding campaign to final shipping. It's not our first campaign, so we're confident in our estimates and that each stage will be completed on time because of our past successful experience. And don't forget that the initial stages are past us already, and the production has started!Another vital thing worth mentioning is about the shipping itself. We understand that there are watch enthusiasts and design lovers all across our planet, so you may be interested in getting a watch or two but at the same time afraid of taxes and additional customs fees that may come with the package, ruining the mood. You don't need to worry about that with CONTEMPUS! We distribute our watches through different regional postal hubs (US, HK, Germany) in order to let every backer to avoid getting undesirable extra payments sending it with the carrier fitting for the specific country. So, no taxes and extras for CONTEMPUS worldwide!Working directly with the manufacturer and leaving all other stages of distribution behind allows us to offer you a much lower price than it'll be at retail. You'll be saving from €60 for a single watch and even more with multiple rewards! The amount of all rewards with such special prices is limited, so don't miss the chance to grab one!If you're looking for a little proof, please, review the feedback from our previous backers. We hope this will be enough to prove that with CONTEMPUS, you'll get a smooth watch crowdfunding experience and a great quality timepiece with an interesting design concept in the end :)The second CONTEMPUS series is offering two size options: 36 and 42 mm in diameter. Their ultra slim cases are made of stainless steel and PVD-coated, which makes it weigh almost nothing. The Amfiteatro and Kupolo straps are made of suede. The watches run on Japanese-made Miyota GL26 movement designed specifically for slim cases. The case is protected with solid crystal mineral glass and has 5 ATM water resistance.Case Diameter: Kupolo - 42 mm | Amfiteatro - 36 mm Case Thickness: Kupolo - 9 mm | Amfiteatro - 7 mmBand Material: Suede Band Width: Kupolo - 20 mm | Amfiteatro - 16 mm Total Weight: 50 gram (Kupolo) / 35 gram (Amfiteatro)Case Material: 316L Stainless Steel Crystal: Mineral GlassMovement: Miyota Quartz Movement GL26 SlimWater Resistant: 5 ATM Social media is a great tool to influence the outcome of the final success. If you dig our concept, share our vision, support our philosophy and like our watches, please, tell your friends by sharing it with them on your social pages.

<p>The ocean is our planet’s life support system. It is the provider of food, recreation, transport and even the oxygen we breathe – and to lose this is too big of a cost. The Ocean relies on nature and we want to do all we can to help protect it.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Over a few years now I was wondering what I can do in order to help our oceans?</h3>
<p>Together with my team we've developed an idea to use clothing with simple designs and engaging messages as a medium to raise the awareness of the threats to the ocean marine life. That’s how the idea of Esprit Profond was born. In French it means “deep spirit”.</p>
<p>Every design we use, has a story behind. We want to inspire global community to become ocean aware by increasing its understanding, wonder and appreciation for our oceans.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Starting our project on the World Whale day, we devoted our first collection to the giants of the abyss.</h3>
<p>For adults we have prepared 3 designs; ""<i>Sleeping Giants</i>"" has an educational goal, providing knowledge about resting position of Sperm Whales. ""<i>Ocean Plastic</i>"" is demonstrating plastic pollution and its effect on marine animals. ""<i>Life confinement</i>"" is bringing into light the problem of Orcas in captivity.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: right;"">Sleeping Giants</h4>
<p>Sperm whales rest by drifting vertically under the sea surface. They sleep only about 2h a day—much less than any other mammal. They begin their sleep at around 20 meters depth, turning their giant bodies up towards the surface. Slowly drifting while sleeping, they reach the surface for the next breath of air. During the day they do several 10 to 15 minute naps like this. Whales are voluntary breathers, which means that they need to think about every breath they take, 24/7.</p>

<p>Plastic accumulating in our oceans and on our beaches has become a global crisis. At current rates plastic is expected to outweigh all the fish in the sea by 2050. Hundreds of thousands of marine animals swallow plastic every year. Plastic ingestion reduces the storage volume of the stomach, causing starvation. Dead animals are often found with stomachs full of plastic. Micro plastic is found broadly in fish meat, ending up in our plates. What is the solution? Recycling and reuse of plastic products, together with support for research and innovation to develop new products to replace single-use plastics.</p>

It is the provider of food, recreation, transport and even the oxygen we breathe – and to lose this is too big of a cost. The Ocean relies on nature and we want to do all we can to help protect it.
 
Over a few years now I was wondering what I can do in order to help our oceans?
Together with my team we've developed an idea to use clothing with simple designs and engaging messages as a medium to raise the awareness of the threats to the ocean marine life. That’s how the idea of Esprit Profond was born. In French it means “deep spirit”.
Every design we use, has a story behind. We want to inspire global community to become ocean aware by increasing its understanding, wonder and appreciation for our oceans.
 
Starting our project on the World Whale day, we devoted our first collection to the giants of the abyss.
For adults we have prepared 3 designs; ""Sleeping Giants"" has an educational goal, providing knowledge about resting position of Sperm Whales. ""Ocean Plastic"" is demonstrating plastic pollution and its effect on marine animals. ""Life confinement"" is bringing into light the problem of Orcas in captivity.


Sleeping Giants
Sperm whales rest by drifting vertically under the sea surface. They sleep only about 2h a day—much less than any other mammal. They begin their sleep at around 20 meters depth, turning their giant bodies up towards the surface. Slowly drifting while sleeping, they reach the surface for the next breath of air. During the day they do several 10 to 15 minute naps like this. Whales are voluntary breathers, which means that they need to think about every breath they take, 24/7.
 





Plastic Ocean
Plastic accumulating in our oceans and on our beaches has become a global crisis. At current rates plastic is expected to outweigh all the fish in the sea by 2050. Hundreds of thousands of marine animals swallow plastic every year. Plastic ingestion reduces the storage volume of the stomach, causing starvation. Dead animals are often found with stomachs full of plastic. Micro plastic is found broadly in fish meat, ending up in our plates. What is the solution? Recycling and reuse of plastic products, together with support for research and innovation to develop new products to replace single-use plastics.
 



Life confinement
Multiple Orcas are held in aquariums for amusement shows. Not having enough space they need, their life expectancy is 2-3 times shorter than in the wilderness. Living in captivity causes Orca’s impressive dorsal fin to collapse and induces a lot of stress, which increases their aggression and creates health problems. Help them with signing one of the petitions against aquarium shows!

<h4><ul><li>Can The Card Holder take cash?</li></ul></h4>
<p>       It can hold up to 10 folded bills. However we think of it as a card holder, not a wallet. We think it shouldn't replace your wallet, it should be a complement (some people barely use cash and might find The Card Holder more convenient than a wallet). It's great for holding business cards or any type of card you need to access quickly.</p>

Calfskin is one of the finest materials available. That's why it's mainly used by luxury brands. We use it because we believe in top quality products.









We believe every wallet should be special and should be different from each other. That's why we keep our leather with a natural finish, that gives each wallet a uniqueness only nature can make. It's like each wallet has its own fingerprint.

Magazine""Reaction to  the Titan Thread People Who Already Trust William Painter  You are a person who needs your socks to keep up with both your life and your style. The Titan Sock was re-imagined and re-engineered using state of the art materials and designs. And with our lifetime guarantee, you never have to worry about them during your adventures.This thread is made from the same materials used in military body armour, cargo nets, and military grade tents. Titan thread is extremely strong (15x stronger than steel), but also deceptively light, pliable, and soft.  We’ve even tested them to last over 10,000 wears and washes without any holes, frays, or tears. Our socks will last you for life. We hate slipping heels. It’s one of those uncomfortable things that can just ruin your day.That’s why we made sure to make a heel that STICKS to your foot.   Our special silicone heel webbing won’t leave your foot - making sure you’ll never experience heel slip again.Silver is a natural antimicrobial agent - meaning it naturally blocks bacteria and fungus. By incorporating ionized silver thread into our socks, we promote better foot health and hygiene.The socks fight against harmful (and smelly) bacteria and fungal growth in your foot and  even helps lower the risk of athlete’s foot. Most “no-show” socks are not truly no-show. They’re created as an afterthought and end up sticking out above your shoe, defeating the purpose of wearing a no-show sock.We paid extra attention to detail to ensure we created a no-show sock that is absolutely invisible when wearing ANY shoe. Our secure stitch technology ensures the sock keeps its shape - even after countless washes. This ensures an optimal fit no matter what.The Titan Sock is the first no-show sock to feature arch support. The sock forms to the natural curves of your foot - giving you a skin-tight performance fit. Get ready for no-show socks you can run in! Our Titan Thread toe cap reinforcement is specifically designed to prevent holes from forming by using thread that is 15X stronger than steel! The toe cap is still supple and soft as silk making it incredibly comfortable to wear. Don’t worry about sweaty feet. Our silver antimicrobial thread not only prevents bacteria, but helps regulate temperature by wicking away moisture and heat.   This makes clammy toes a thing of the past.Our ultra-elastic fit lets our socks stretch to almost any size - making them nearly one size fits all.  Your feet are good to go!We like to keep things minimal.So we made sure every pair of Titan Socks match -- no random colors, weird designs, or left and right specific socks. Just clean, minimal, black or white socks.Just like our all products, we back these socks for life!

<p><u><strong>My Story</strong></u></p>
<p>My name is Danesha Anglin and I am first generation Jamaican-American. I am the youngest of 11 children and out of all of us I have always been the one to take ""risks"" and just do whatever my heart desires because I do not believe in failure, only lessons, hence this new adventure.</p>
<p>I attended the University of Florida (Go Gators) where I earned my Bachelors in Special Education and Masters in Early Childhood Education. After graduating I taught kindergarten for 5.5 years and in January 2020 I made a huge leap of faith and closed that door and started a new journey. I am currently a Flight Attendant-- as of today I am now furloughed along with 8,099 others and will have to wait on my company to do recalls, whenever that may be. I had already been saving slowly but surely to start this business. After finding out that I was indeed going to be looking at a possible furlough a couple months ago I decided that I would reach out to my community for some support. I was nervous, but after I told some of my close friends they encouraged me and reassured me that there were others out there like them who would love to support my next journey-- my OWN CLOTHING LINE! </p>
<p>Back in January 2014 I bought my very first sewing machine. My friend kept hearing me mention how I thought it would be “cool” to make my own clothes and I was certain I could teach myself. He then encouraged me to purchase a “starter” machine and give it a try. I got it and I just went for it. YouTube, Google and eventually a sewing community on IG helped me to learn a lot. I made my first full matching athletic set in 2019 as I got serious about my fitness, being cute while getting fit became a priority. I noticed that when I loved the way my workout clothes fit and looked I felt more confident in the gym. After buying lots of athletic sets from different brands I noticed things that I loved about certain sets and things I wish others had so I started with a pattern and tweaked it to make something I loved.</p>
<p>After I made that set and shared it I had countless people ask me to make them a set but I knew that sewing for hire doesn't bring me joy however seeing others in something I made does! So here we are, I am finally doing it, sharing my work with others just in a different way. Receiving support from all of you will make it possible for me to hire a project manager who I have already found. She will connect me with a pattern designer who will bring my designs to life in paper form. Then I will have a grader who will turn my patterns into multiple sizes and after that I will get samples made then take pre-orders! Once the campaign is complete and fully funded this project I will keep you all updated via a weekly newsletter that you will be able to opt into.

My name is Danesha Anglin and I am first generation Jamaican-American. I am the youngest of 11 children and out of all of us I have always been the one to take ""risks"" and just do whatever my heart desires because I do not believe in failure, only lessons, hence this new adventure.
I attended the University of Florida (Go Gators) where I earned my Bachelors in Special Education and Masters in Early Childhood Education. After graduating I taught kindergarten for 5.5 years and in January 2020 I made a huge leap of faith and closed that door and started a new journey. I am currently a Flight Attendant-- as of today I am now furloughed along with 8,099 others and will have to wait on my company to do recalls, whenever that may be. I had already been saving slowly but surely to start this business. After finding out that I was indeed going to be looking at a possible furlough a couple months ago I decided that I would reach out to my community for some support. I was nervous, but after I told some of my close friends they encouraged me and reassured me that there were others out there like them who would love to support my next journey-- my OWN CLOTHING LINE!

At the age of 6, I moved from Enduro Racing to Motocross and from that day on, I knew this was my dream. I went to school during the week, and races every weekend, that I can remember, in places all over the state of Arkansas. Over the years, I was lucky enough to have a family that took me to surrounding states for races in Oklahoma and Texas, Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama, you name it as the list goes on. I’ve also got to race in Las Vegas for the US Open at the age of 8. That was an experience of a lifetime to be surrounded by professional motorcross riders I only dreamt of meeting.</p>
<p>Lots of broken bones and bruises later, I was given the nickname Crashton. I then began to believe I was indestructible. </p>
<p>In 2005, I then went on to race my first Loretta Lynn’s Amateur Motocross Championship. I finally saw a future for myself. I believed I could reach my dreams as I was heading in the right direction. </p>
<p>However, shortly after my first Championship race, I was to have a crash in which led to my first collar bone brake, the right one to be exact. Little did I know, this would be the crash that was only the beginning of a string of bad injuries, one after the other. This one in particular left me unable to ride for about 3 months. Once I recovered, I was back to riding and had a crash that left me with a broken hand. I attempted to race with a broken hand as I was determined to qualify for the 2007 Loretta Lynn race. Unfortunately, I could not get the start I hoped for to make it as a top 6 competitor, which is the last position they will take from each race class to go to the championships.</p>
<p>Following, I was to upgrade to a bigger bike. I trained for the next year or so, entering all of the local races I could. In January 2010, I had the opportunity to train with Chris Brennan in California for a month. This was to prepare me for the Spring Nationals in March. During my first warm up race back in Texas, and some bad luck, I wrecked which left me with another broken collar bone, my left side this time. My collar bone was shattered, I required a plate and 8 screws be put in. This left me unable to ride for about 4 months. However, once I was given the green light to ride again, I did. </p>
<p>I was offered a Sponsorship from the team, Aldridge motorsports. My first race took place at the Freestone Raceway in Texas. I ended up getting hit from behind and broke my right collar bone for the second time, this time getting another plate and 6 screws put in. I also had someone else’s bone marrow put in to spark the dead bone. At a check up with the doctor for this injury, I was told I may not be able to ride ever again. Hearing those words broke my heart, I was devastated. My bone did not start growing until 4 months after the surgery I had. Leaving me unable to race for a year, I could not get motocross off my mind. I was not done yet, despite what the doctor said. From 2011 to 2012, I rode for fun while training hard core a bit here and there however I was 18 by then and could not expect my parents to financially support me any longer. My parents have already given up to much for my dreams so I wanted to find a way to do it on my own. I moved to Australia with my sister for a couple of months to work and clear my head. I found a good job to make money whilst finding my own way. I then decided it was time to go back to the states and give it another try as I don’t believe I should give up just yet no matter my age. I have been working for my father ever since, riding as much as I can. </p>
<p>I am still chasing my dream no matter what it takes, however, I am finding it hard to do so financially on my own. I am now asking for donations from my friends and family to sponsor my racing career so I can get to where I have always wanted. I am currently training harder than ever as I believe 2015 can be my year. I promise to every person that donates towards my dreams, I will remember always and think of you as my sponsor no matter how little the donation as I believe every little bit can help. </p>
<p>Once I make it, I will send you an autographed picture ;) </p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read my story, and please if you could share this with your family and friends as well as keep me in your prayers, I would be very grateful for this.</p>

<p>Angel Hair is an innovative new technique for decorating surfaces with precious and semi-precious metals. Every angel hair design begins with an individual strand of precious metal about one-third the thickness of the average human hair. The metal is a highly polished perfectly round surface and 24k in purity.</p>
<p>Each delicate strand of precious metal angel hair is intricately ‘woven’ with extremely high precision and accuracy. The assembly process consists of metal forming and direct metal connections in the form of precisely shaped loops. The image is fabricated on top of another precious metal surface (either 24K gold or silver) and built up one strand at a time into a sophisticated final image.</p>
<p>The Angel Hair technique enables the creation of an unlimited variety of beautifully sculptured surfaces that capture and illuminate the intricate detail of each design, by using 24K pure gold or other precious metals. This results in more surface area that is exposed to light, increasing the reflective luminance vs. traditional techniques such as embossing or gold leaf.</p>
<p><strong>Current available angel hair metal strand types are: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>24K Gold</li>
<li>24K Silver</li>
<li>24K Copper</li>
</ul><p>* Optional: 24K Palladium anti-tarnish coating on copper or silver.</p>
<p><strong>Current available base plate types</strong></p>
<ul><ul>
<li>24K gold plated surface</li>
<li>24K silver plated surface</li>
</ul></ul><p>over a variety of base metal (ex. stainless steel, copper, nickel )</p>
<p>This technique can be applied to any kind of picture or vision (eg. watch faces, framed artworks, pendants, trophy's, paper-weights etc.) We encourage you to glance at our image gallery to see examples of how this fantastic quality art-form can be customized.</p>
<p><strong>Our Company</strong></p>
<p>Our company name is Angel Hair Gold, and we have full access to the above mentioned angel hair technique; as well as a generous supply of available product(s).</p>
<p>Our company vision is to expand, and make this unique product and technique available to the general public. Through the advanced innovative angel hair technique high quality metals are woven into high quality designs. Due to the unique almost string like nature of these woven metals, their actual physical weights remain low. Thus, leaving a stunning high quality product at a very lucrative price point (wholesale &amp; retail.)</p>
<p>There is no limit, any picture, any symbol, any form of art can be uniquely integrated with high quality 24k gold, silver or copper; creating unique one of a kind visuals.

<p>Angel Hair Gold is going public, in order to facilitate this process; we have made our products and services available to customers through Indiegogo.

</ul></div>","What is the Angel Hair Technique?
Angel Hair is an innovative new technique for decorating surfaces with precious and semi-precious metals. Every angel hair design begins with an individual strand of precious metal about one-third the thickness of the average human hair. The metal is a highly polished perfectly round surface and 24k in purity.
Each delicate strand of precious metal angel hair is intricately ‘woven’ with extremely high precision and accuracy. The assembly process consists of metal forming and direct metal connections in the form of precisely shaped loops. The image is fabricated on top of another precious metal surface (either 24K gold or silver) and built up one strand at a time into a sophisticated final image.
The Angel Hair technique enables the creation of an unlimited variety of beautifully sculptured surfaces that capture and illuminate the intricate detail of each design, by using 24K pure gold or other precious metals. This results in more surface area that is exposed to light, increasing the reflective luminance vs. traditional techniques such as embossing or gold leaf.
Current available angel hair metal strand types are: 

24K Gold
24K Silver
24K Copper
* Optional: 24K Palladium anti-tarnish coating on copper or silver.
Current available base plate types

24K gold plated surface
24K silver plated surface
over a variety of base metal (ex. stainless steel, copper, nickel )
This technique can be applied to any kind of picture or vision (eg. watch faces, framed artworks, pendants, trophy's, paper-weights etc.) We encourage you to glance at our image gallery to see examples of how this fantastic quality art-form can be customized.
Our Company
Our company name is Angel Hair Gold, and we have full access to the above mentioned angel hair technique; as well as a generous supply of available product(s).
Our company vision is to expand, and make this unique product and technique available to the general public. Through the advanced innovative angel hair technique high quality metals are woven into high quality designs. Due to the unique almost string like nature of these woven metals, their actual physical weights remain low. Thus, leaving a stunning high quality product at a very lucrative price point (wholesale & retail.)
There is no limit, any picture, any symbol, any form of art can be uniquely integrated with high quality 24k gold, silver or copper; creating unique one of a kind visuals. We envision not only an array of Angel Hair Gold products and designs; but also wholesale and partnership opportunities on an international scale.

I designed my first timepiece for my father years ago as a Tribute to him for all the things he did for me growing up. Timepieces are far more important than just being functional jewelry. They serve as markers of the most important memories and people in our lives. They can be carried on for generations among family members. My father and I both are both the team behind this new timepiece entitled the ""V1-Gent"" under our new brand Gentleman Warfare. We have years of experience in all aspects of watch design in production and are truly proud of the quality and look of this piece.Choose your perk on the right:Classic - Steel Case, White Dial, Brown StrapAqua - Steel Case, Blue Dial, Blue StrapStealth - Black case, Black Dial, Black StrapAllure - Black and Rose gold Case, Black and Rose gold Dial, Black StrapBronze - Bronze Case, Brown Dial, Brown StrapThere are key elements that make a timepiece a worthwhile investment.

The Subdials were switched for disks which gives the V1-Gent a slick and high end appearance often not seen.

Cardlax is a device that will allow you to have the relaxation you desire and need anywhere you are. With its 4.7 mm, it becomes the world’s thinnest electrical massager. An easy design for comprehensive operation. With a double battery layout it gives you, the user the ability to enjoy relaxation for long periods of time.  Take it in your wallet, purse, pocket and enjoy a relaxing time, no need for those big bulky machines Frequency is significant for most EMS applications and is given in Hertz (Hz). When choosing the frequency you should take into account that there are individual differences.  Low frequencies (no higher than about 18 Hz) will mainly activate the slower reacting red muscle fibers. Power and endurance athletes will thus benefit from electrical muscle stimulation in this frequency range to build up muscle.  When applied, it will cause a distinct contraction of the muscle. Higher frequencies between 30 and 50 Hz stimulate the fast contracting white muscle fibers.  With frequencies of over 50 Hz, the muscle is deliberately overtaxed and can thus be forced into muscle hypertrophy (muscle build-up). To avoid overtraining, the interval between the sessions must be correctly chosen so that the muscle has enough time to regenerate. 3 modes for you specific satisfaction, use them separately or in a continues loop of all modes. A 4 button layout makes it easy for just about anyone to use it. Simple power button, a mode button so you can select the style of massage you would like to receive, and finally the plus and minus buttons that allows you to change the intensity of the massages.Small and slim enough to just put it on your purse and take it with you anywhere and use it at anytime.How about those muscles pains after training, use Cardlax to relax your muscles and recover faster, and be ready for your next training.Don't let those stressful days get the best of you, with Cardlax just sit back and enjoy a relaxing moment even in your stressful office.               With our gel pads you can give them new life by washing them, just use warm water and your pads will be available for longer uses. Product Specs:  Dimentions: 8.5cm x5.1cm x4.7mm Battery: 140mH up to 10 hours of usage. Bluethooth version: 4.0 Charging port: Micro-USB               A simple and user friendly app, has been designed with the intention of giving our users a more seamless experience between the app and the device, but even though the app has been designed, the cost of the Bluetooth chip is expensive; therefore, we need your help to reach 300k to make our app available.   A small team of designers, engineers and dreamers, based off Delaware and Hong Kong, with huge hopes to bring you a new way to be relaxed in this crazy stressful world.

<p>Wind energy can power the world 100 times over, but more methods are needed to harness this power. Ocean shipping is the life line of the global economy, but ships emit over 20 million tons of greenhouse gas annually. Conventional freighters burn extremely polluting fuel and are not inclined to make transformation unless an outside entity leads the way. Pacific Sky Power Sustainable Shipping is focused on innovation. It is our mission to implement sustainable methods for clean environmentally friendly shipping.  </p>

Fuel burning freighter ships are currently used because they are the most cost effective way to transport goods across the ocean. Shipping ports have developed to service these vessels which are proportionally long and narrow. Our ships will be compatible with existing port facilities, but at the same time have the ability to deploy and retract industrial sized sails. Catamaran ships under sail power can carry heavy loads efficiently but their wide stance would be problematic at most shipping ports. To achieve high efficiency ocean transportation and port compatibility, ships will use telescoping members to expand for sailing performance at sea and retract for hassle free port maneuvering. Some conventional methods may be needed but with the combined use of cleaner fuels, sleeker hull shapes, and sails, a tremendous reduction in fossil fuel consumption is possible. </p>

<p><b>Prototype Development </b></p>
<p>The Cat 30 is a 30
inch long prototype ship and it needs steering control to conduct more sail
power trials. This will involve fabricating rudders and installing a radio
controlled servo. The Cat 60 will be a fully operational 60 inch long prototype
with all actions operable through radio control. This will enable us to conduct
realistic ocean trials and calculate fuel use on different sailing courses and
wind conditions.</p>
<p><b>Cat 60 Construction </b>- The main portion
of hulls will be shaped out of foam. The top level of hulls will house cross
members along with expand and contract drives. A custom telescoping mast will
be developed along with the boom and other sail rigging. A rudder system and
propulsion motors will be installed to complete the Cat 60 prototype. </p>
<p><b>Cat 60 Ocean Trials </b>- Using radio
control the ship operator will control all ship actions. The ship will be
loaded to simulate real shipping and we will test in different wind conditions
and sailing courses.  Motorized drives will expand the ship for increased
stability. After locking into a wide stance, sail rigging will be deployed and
tested on all courses.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Feasibility Studies</b></p>
<p>Some feasibility studies
will be conducted in phase 1 to investigate ship and sail designs. We will work
with naval engineers on this detailed investigation. The outcome of these studies
will set our course for engineering full size ships.</p>

After locating and securing a suitable base yard, ship construction will begin with the hulls and cross members. After competing these, a crane will be used to aid in assembly. With the hulls and cross members together, a hydraulic system will be installed and expand and retract performance will be tested. The mast and other sail rigging will be fabricated and connected with hydraulics. The bridge tower and living quarters will constructed and installed. The rudder and all other systems will be installed to complete ship construction.            </p></li>

<p></p></div>","Wind energy can power the world 100 times over, but more methods are needed to harness this power. Ocean shipping is the life line of the global economy, but ships emit over 20 million tons of greenhouse gas annually. Conventional freighters burn extremely polluting fuel and are not inclined to make transformation unless an outside entity leads the way. Pacific Sky Power Sustainable Shipping is focused on innovation. It is our mission to implement sustainable methods for clean environmentally friendly shipping.  

Global Shipping RoutesOn the high seas, wind is the most abundant energy source, but commercial freighters no longer harness this power. Fuel burning freighter ships are currently used because they are the most cost effective way to transport goods across the ocean. Shipping ports have developed to service these vessels which are proportionally long and narrow. Our ships will be compatible with existing port facilities, but at the same time have the ability to deploy and retract industrial sized sails. Catamaran ships under sail power can carry heavy loads efficiently but their wide stance would be problematic at most shipping ports. To achieve high efficiency ocean transportation and port compatibility, ships will use telescoping members to expand for sailing performance at sea and retract for hassle free port maneuvering. Some conventional methods may be needed but with the combined use of cleaner fuels, sleeker hull shapes, and sails, a tremendous reduction in fossil fuel consumption is possible.

Prototype Development 
The Cat 30 is a 30
inch long prototype ship and it needs steering control to conduct more sail
power trials. This will involve fabricating rudders and installing a radio
controlled servo. The Cat 60 will be a fully operational 60 inch long prototype
with all actions operable through radio control. This will enable us to conduct
realistic ocean trials and calculate fuel use on different sailing courses and
wind conditions.
Cat 60 Construction - The main portion
of hulls will be shaped out of foam. The top level of hulls will house cross
members along with expand and contract drives. A custom telescoping mast will
be developed along with the boom and other sail rigging. A rudder system and
propulsion motors will be installed to complete the Cat 60 prototype. 
Cat 60 Ocean Trials - Using radio
control the ship operator will control all ship actions. The ship will be
loaded to simulate real shipping and we will test in different wind conditions
and sailing courses.  Motorized drives will expand the ship for increased
stability. After locking into a wide stance, sail rigging will be deployed and
tested on all courses.

Feasibility Studies
Some feasibility studies
will be conducted in phase 1 to investigate ship and sail designs. We will work
with naval engineers on this detailed investigation. The outcome of these studies
will set our course for engineering full size ships.

Finite Element Analysis
Basic & Advanced Structural Analysis
Propulsion System Analysis
Stability Support
Waterborne Transportation Analysis
Maintenance Management Studies
Failure Modes & Effects Analysis

Operational & Capital Cost Analysis
Electrical Engineering - Electrical engineering will include: expand and contract drives, sail rigging drives, rudder system drives, and all other electronics.



Preliminary & Detailed Design

Naval Architectural - Naval architectural will include: hull, sails, rudders and cross member supports.

Hull Development, Definition & Fairing
Structural Design & Advanced Analysis including FEA
Developing 3D Models
Construction Cost Estimating                              
Phase 3. Ship Construction - After completing detailed ship engineering, ship construction will start. The outcome of ship engineering will determine construction methods. After locating and securing a suitable base yard, ship construction will begin with the hulls and cross members. After competing these, a crane will be used to aid in assembly. With the hulls and cross members together, a hydraulic system will be installed and expand and retract performance will be tested. The mast and other sail rigging will be fabricated and connected with hydraulics. The bridge tower and living quarters will constructed and installed. The rudder and all other systems will be installed to complete ship construction.            

Phase 4. Pilot Projects - After conducting initial ocean trials, pilot projects will begin. One between Bellingham - Seattle and the other between Seattle - San Francisco. This will start Sustainable Shipping and eliminating trucks from our highways.    






Project Funding - The 1st $10,000 raised in this campaign will go to prototype development. Any additional funds over $10,000 will go to conducting feasibility studies. The development budget for Pacific Sky Power Sustainable Shipping is over $10 million. As we progress forward,  funds will be raised through more crowd funding campaigns, grants and traditional bank financing.
Innovative Approach to An Old Idea - Since the industrial revolution, burning fossil fuel has become the most cost effective way to transport goods across the ocean. Today, with fuel costs rising and the threats of global warming, it is our primary objective to make wind powered shipping economically viable once again. Developing sail powered shipping is a massive undertaking, but every project needs a beginning and Indiegogo provides opportunity for all. After validating our technology, a large segment of other shipping companies may follow to reduce costs, fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This will help stabilize costs for everyone and promote stability worldwide.

End Goal - The end goal of this project is to operate a fleet of sustainable freighter ships and grow the business based on available wind energy. Industrial sized sails will be used on primarily downwind courses and with sleek hull shapes, our ships will travel efficiently to pre-determined port destinations. After pilot projects are compete, open ocean shipping will begin to take advantage of stronger more consistent wind energy. The West Coast to Hawaii and other outlying islands, Hawaii to Asia and back to the US. When using a fleet of ships, delivery could be as steady as conventional shipping. Launch a ship a day and unload a ship a day at the destination.

<p>Hello all my nerdy darlings! I'm Sarah Macklin a seamstress
and all around geeky girl looking to start a little company called Geek a la

nearly twenty years who's always wanted to enter in world of fashion design.
I'm also a lifelong comic, gaming, and animation fan who's sought to combine my
love of fashion and my love of pop culture.</p>
<p>This brought me to the idea of Geek a la Mode. I've come to
realize than all of my geeky clothing was restricted to a collection of
t-shirts (however cool they may be). However, my job, where I spend most of my
day, doesn't exactly look kindly on such casual dress. I knew I couldn't be the
only one going through this dilemma. And if I couldn't find clothes that I
could wear to work and show my geek side then I would have to make them. </p>
<h2><br/></h2><h2>What Is This Campaign For Exactly?</h2>
<p>I'm glad you asked! My goal for starting up is $8000.
Everything raised will go directly to purchasing the equipment and materials
needed to bring you the best geeky clothing I can provide. Even if we don't
reach the goal, know that every dollar raised will still go to getting Geek a
la Mode off the ground.</p>
<p>Your contributions will help purchase:</p>

<p><br/></p><h2>Let Your Geek Flag Fly</h2>
<p>I know personally how your true, geeky life and your work
life may seem incompatible. But with the start of Geek a la Mode it doesn't

<h2>No Moolah? No Problem!</h2>
<p>If you aren't able to contribute financially, no problem! I
totally understand. You can still help out the campaign by boosting the hell

I know personally how your true, geeky life and your work
life may seem incompatible. But with the start of Geek a la Mode it doesn't
have to be that way any longer. You shouldn't have to hide parts of your
personality. You should be able to express your geekdom freely. With the start
of Geek a la Mode I want to help you let your geek flag fly!
No Moolah? No Problem!
If you aren't able to contribute financially, no problem! I
totally understand. You can still help out the campaign by boosting the hell
out of it! Share it on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, in your coffee shop and your
comic shop. The more people that can be a part of this the better.

</div></div>","Mission
We are Kulturpon Incorporated. Our focus is international unity through cultural
acceptance and equality. The world and all of its citizens are truly remarkable, and 
nothing exemplifies this fact better than the incredible regional diversity and
craftsmanship that its designers exhibit. We tirelessly scour the globe, searching
for new products and artisans to feature in our international look book and 
Kulturblend World Store. True creativity transcends racial boundaries, and our 
mission is to construct a global stage for these talents to be witnessed and enjoyed.
The Kulturblend World Store is located at shop.kulturpon.com and the look book 
can be perused at kulturpon.com.

 We are starting a new initiative called The International Fashion Olympics. This

is an international product design competition, open to all designers and brands.
Using the original Olympics as a template, we will award designs attaining the most
votes with the Gold, Silver and Bronze medals respectively. We believe this to be a
grand opportunity for unknown designers and brands to burst onto the world stage,
impressing consumers, investors and potential partners. The 2014-2015 Winter
International Fashion Olympics has started, and votes can be cast on 

fashionolympics.com. The voting infrastructure will always take place online so that
the world may vote, regardless of location. However, we are seeking funding in 
order to expand this initiative, Twice a year, The International Fashion Olympics
will be held in various cities around the globe. These events will include fashion
shows and vendor areas where patrons can purchase international products. We
will also invite guest speakers to present their inside knowledge in regards to 
fashion, design, and globalization. The premise is simple.  The world comes 
together every four years for The Olympics. There is no reason why the world can't 


come together in honor of its rich artisans and their extraordinary creations. 


The magnitude of your contributions can't accurately be placed into words. 
You are one of the visionaries, embarking on a journey that will revolutionize how
the world views fashion and product design. Together, we will carve out a new 
platform of equality for all of the unknown geniuses in remote locales. They will 
have an opportunity to compete against brands with storied histories. These 

individuals will have a chance to garner support from enthusiasts, eager to see
them prosper and grow.
Goal
We are trying to raise 500,000  for this endeavor. These funds will be 
allocated for Summer International Fashion Olympics in Atlanta, Ga (SIFO-2015),
and the Summer International Fashion Olympics in Brazil (SIFO-2016). Our 
expenditures will include venue rentals, speaker and artists salaries, voting 


infrastructure, and advertisements. A large portion of these funds will be used to 


bring financially challenged designers to the events. We will assist them in making 


their travel arrangements and other incidentals. 

Perks
 There are several investment levels that you may choose from. 


Complimentary tickets to all events will be given- along with discounts to The Kulturblend World Store. 


We understand that this is a lofty goal, but rest assured. The International
Fashion Olympics will still commence on the aforementioned dates, regardless
of our goal attainment. As stated earlier, the Winter International Fashion Olympics 


is ongoing, and over 6,000 judges have already visited fashionolympics.com. We

consider this response as confirmation that our initiative is important being that
the competition started in late November.

The voting infrastructure is already in place, so all funds will be allocated to the 


planned physical events.

Impact  The International Fashion Olympics offers the world another opportunity to 

put aside cultural differences and regional disagreements. There is more than
enough division on Earth. It is our hope that through fashion and product design,
individuals from various backgrounds will establish common grounds upon 
which future relationships can be forged and maintained. This initiative may also
help foster trade and other collaborations between countries or regions with 
strained relations.
 We at Kulturpon are confident that this project will be successful. Thousands

of ""international judges"" have already visited fashionolympics.com, and this 
number will only increase as awareness spreads. In addition, our look book,

kulturpon.com, has had over 55,000 visitors from every continent on Earth!

<h2>Why did we design it<br/>
</h2>
<p>Some time ago, 3 close friends of mine died in a car
accident. I will never forget their funeral. I still see in my mind their young
children and felt sad and empty inside. I was looking at them, and couldn’t
stop thinking about my own family. On that day I decided to commit all my time
and effort to making our roads safer to drive on. I want to protect my family
and yours from the pain of losing loved ones. And<span>  I want to help every parent to sleep better,
knowing that their child has help during the most dangerous time as a
new driver.</span></p>

</div></div>","We are introducing a REFERRAL PROGRAM. Check out our latest
update for details!



This is CarVi.

 
The most advanced driving safety technology in the world.
Introducing a system
that helps monitor the road for you. CarVi is small, easy to install, and with
the most advanced camera technology in the world you can feel safe knowing
there's an extra set of eyes on the road.



CarVi uses cameras to
monitor the road and keep you safe. 

CarVi - Drive safe. Monitor your driving habits. Offers peace of mind for parents of teenage drivers.



Meet CarVi: Versatile, Affordable and Easy
to Install Driver’s Assistant
CarVi employs the vision based safety tools to gather data, using a small
dashboard camera installed in your car that “talks” to your smart phone. The
camera captures video which CarVi analyzes in real time. If it senses potential
trouble, it issues audible and visual warnings. 
It monitors:
Safe Lane
Changes – CarVi adds an extra set of “eyes” to your driving, monitoring
your position in the lane and the location of the car ahead. 


Front End
Collision Danger – CarVi monitors your distance from the driver in front of
you. Not only will it warn you if you come too close, but it will also help you
practice maintaining a safe distance if you’re prone to tailgating.




CarVi as a Dash Cam – CarVi has different options for recording video while you drive.  These video will be recorded on the memory card which you can transfer to your smartphone for later viewing.
Reckless
Driving and Hard Braking –CarVi learns your driving patterns and helps you
adjust.

Jackrabbit
Starts – You may not even notice certain driving habits once you get used
to them. CarVi helps you learn to give your car just enough gas to efficiently
ease into the flow of traffic.But CarVi doesn’t stop working when you turn off your
engine. The smartphone interface displays your driving data, providing your
driving “SKOR” for the day, and showing you the areas where you did well, and
where you might need some work. With the data it collects, CarVi gives you
suggestions on how to improve your driving skills.

Who Needs CarVi
Distracted driving due to smartphone use is one of the major
reasons for car accidents. With CarVi, your smartphone will transform from an
enemy on the road into your guardian.

Why did we design it

Some time ago, 3 close friends of mine died in a car
accident. I will never forget their funeral. I still see in my mind their young
children and felt sad and empty inside. I was looking at them, and couldn’t
stop thinking about my own family. On that day I decided to commit all my time
and effort to making our roads safer to drive on. I want to protect my family
and yours from the pain of losing loved ones. And  I want to help every parent to sleep better,
knowing that their child has help during the most dangerous time as a
new driver.
