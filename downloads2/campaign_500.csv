is the #ARTLIVES billboard campaign?</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>At
<a href=""www.rareform.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RAREFORM</a>, we believe in stories. For us, that story begins
with bold billboards destined to sit in a landfill. Normally, that’s where the
story would end, but we upcycle these billboards and give them the chance to
become surfbags, backpacks, duffels, wallets, and other accessories.</p>
<p>This
time, we’re getting in on the process from the beginning. During our “Art
Lives” series, we’ll be asking some of our favorite artists to design a
billboard for RAREFORM. When their artwork is finished, our partner, Lamar
Advertising, will print the art on a billboard and display it in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Once
a billboard in our “Art Lives” campaign goes up, our supporters will have the
chance to choose what piece of the artwork they want to claim as their own.
We’ll then transform their special piece of art into a limited edition RAREFORM
bag.</p>
<p>Just
like every billboard is unique, every RAREFORM product is also completely
one-of-a-kind. We get all kinds of vinyl, and each piece comes with its own
style, its own set of wear and tear, and its own story. Every item we make is
creative and expressive. We make bags with a story to tell.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444098620/todz1fsncalxhylxhrkm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444109785/xfnk8hatnhsxq4vly7k9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443643420/ffemp0hvsrzu123wy6y1.jpg"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/></p><h2><b><br/></b></h2><h2><b>The Artist &amp; Art Behind the Billboard</b></h2><h4><b>Artist: The

It is curated by Karola Luettringhaus and managed by a small staff and a larger ""nest"" of collaborators. <br/>
</li>
<li>We aim to create a community of dancers, actors, video makers, visual artists, performance artists, and musicians who interact with the local community in Wilmington, NC and the surrounding areas.</li>
<li>July 7-10th, 2016 will be the 5th festival. Artists from both the US and abroad have performed in past festivals. Venues have ranged from Carolina Beach, Cameron Art Center, Bellamy Mansion, Cucalorus Headquarters, Greenfield Lake, and much more.</li>
<li>We need $1600 to get our budget on the right course for this year! We are choosing a theme of ""sweet 16"" as a metaphor for getting us driving independently on the road to financial success. We have 16 days to raise $1600 in order to achieve the first phase of our development plan. Following this event we will host a live fundraiser and festival preview in April. The event will take place at Ironclad Brewery on April 30th in Wilmington. We will also be applying for art grants and corporate sponsorships in order to round out our financial plan for 2016. YOU can help us with this first phase!</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul> <li>To start with, we are looking for artists to support art. That's why we have so many options for small donations. Artists can help by giving as little as $10.</li> <li>We want interested audiences to help produce. We need interpreters, investigators, and innovators to join us in our quest towards a workable budget.</li>
<li>There are many choices and options for different wallet sizes. See the information listed in the Perks.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <ul> <li>Funds from this kickoff event will go to payment for publicity, venues, administration, and 2016 artists. You will see the fruition immediately as the Sarus Festival grows its presence in print and online. You can also track venues as they are confirmed on our website and social media platforms.</li>
<li>The Sarus Festival will continue to bring together both neophyte and mid-career artists to create and perform in multiple artistic mediums from across the United States and abroad.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <ul> <li>We have been operating with minimal funding and need help at all levels to be successful in producing this festival. The donation pipeline is crucial to our advancement and longevity.</li>
<li>We WANT to pay artists!</li>
<li>We also want to be able to pay staff what they are worth and not rely fully on volunteerism.</li>
<li>The Sarus Festival produces high quality art and needs sound financial footing to maintain the caliber of work necessary to compete in a contemporary art market. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <ul> <li>Artists are wanted to create and sell innovative merchandise at our live fundraiser/festival preview event on April 30th.</li>

It is curated by Karola Luettringhaus and managed by a small staff and a larger ""nest"" of collaborators. 

We aim to create a community of dancers, actors, video makers, visual artists, performance artists, and musicians who interact with the local community in Wilmington, NC and the surrounding areas.
July 7-10th, 2016 will be the 5th festival. Artists from both the US and abroad have performed in past festivals. Venues have ranged from Carolina Beach, Cameron Art Center, Bellamy Mansion, Cucalorus Headquarters, Greenfield Lake, and much more.
We need $1600 to get our budget on the right course for this year! We are choosing a theme of ""sweet 16"" as a metaphor for getting us driving independently on the road to financial success. We have 16 days to raise $1600 in order to achieve the first phase of our development plan. Following this event we will host a live fundraiser and festival preview in April. The event will take place at Ironclad Brewery on April 30th in Wilmington. We will also be applying for art grants and corporate sponsorships in order to round out our financial plan for 2016. YOU can help us with this first phase!
   What We Need & What You Get  To start with, we are looking for artists to support art. That's why we have so many options for small donations. Artists can help by giving as little as $10. We want interested audiences to help produce. We need interpreters, investigators, and innovators to join us in our quest towards a workable budget.
There are many choices and options for different wallet sizes. See the information listed in the Perks.    The Impact  Funds from this kickoff event will go to payment for publicity, venues, administration, and 2016 artists. You will see the fruition immediately as the Sarus Festival grows its presence in print and online. You can also track venues as they are confirmed on our website and social media platforms.
The Sarus Festival will continue to bring together both neophyte and mid-career artists to create and perform in multiple artistic mediums from across the United States and abroad.    Risks & Challenges  We have been operating with minimal funding and need help at all levels to be successful in producing this festival. The donation pipeline is crucial to our advancement and longevity.
We WANT to pay artists!
We also want to be able to pay staff what they are worth and not rely fully on volunteerism.
The Sarus Festival produces high quality art and needs sound financial footing to maintain the caliber of work necessary to compete in a contemporary art market.     Other Ways You Can Help  Artists are wanted to create and sell innovative merchandise at our live fundraiser/festival preview event on April 30th.

I found what truly inspires me.I have been doing research on visual perception for over a decade, learning about the visual system and how it interacts with our higher-level cognitive functions. Later, I started practicing meditation and studied how it affects our brain and our perceptions.Then one day I asked myself: What moves me? What  really inspires me?I looked inside myself and it came to me...I wanted to share with others what I felt was inside of me, the feeling of being in the moment, of breathing the colors and sounds, and the extraordinary sense of oneness with nature. My photography is the process of understanding with all the senses and the body: feeling like the flower in the sun, being the drop of rain.And Nature’s Atelier is all these things,  all the colors and forms that give me  incredible energy and joy.                    
Nature’s
Atelier is a celebration of mindful living and our deep connection with nature.
My approach to photography is contemplative. It emphasizes simplicity and the aesthetic experience found in our natural environment. My images embody the beauty of the sensory experience: light, composition, and colors reveal the natural beauty and harmony found in nature, celebrating its sensual experience.                               The goal of this campaign is to fund the production of Nature’s Atelier Mindful Living textile products: the tea towel collection is printed and sewn in USA and the silk scarves collection is printed and sewn in Italy.    Each photographic image used on these products is a contemplation of nature. A harmony of colors and lines of delicate flower patterns are then digitally printed on natural fabrics: cotton /linen blend and silk that will then become tea towels and scarves.                                          The technology of textile digital printing offers exciting new ways to translate the nature's beautiful details onto fabric. This process gives an excellent reproduction of photographic images onto textiles. It offers a more rich experience of colors and great detail.Using this process I can offer a more rich and immersive experience of my nature photography by creating beautiful textile products.                             Life is a sensory experience and I believe in creating and developing products that can nourish our senses.THE TEA TOWEL COLLECTIONI have created nine designs for the tea towel collection. Each design represents a heart-centered quality inspired by nature.I have printed samples of the tea towels in US. The tea towels are made of a cotton/linen blend and are digitally printed by a company in Durham, North Carolina and sewn in Fall River, Massachusetts. The feedback on these tea towels has been very positive! A retailer in Providence, Rhode Island now carries the first collection of Mindful Inspirations tea towels. Kreatelier store - Providence, RITHE SILK SCARF COLLECTIONAs a scarf lover, I was inspired by the idea of printing my images on silk, as a way to combine the warm and luxurious sensation of wearing a soft scarf with the vibrant colors of flowers and leaves. I have created six designs for the silk scarf collection, inspired by the diverse color palette of the seasons. The samples I have printed show the beautiful and rich colors of the fabric.Agave - silk crepe de chine                                                         Tulip Petals - silk satin                                            Japanese Maple Leaves - silk crepe de chine                                                                      Rosy - silk satin                                                     Winter Flowers - silk crepe de chine                                                        Bird of Paradise - silk satinThe silk scarves are made of 100% silk: satin has a more shiny finish and crepe de chine has a matte finish. The scarves will be digitally printed and hand hemmed by a manufacturer near Como in Italy. Internationally known for their expertise and craftsmanship, the manufacturer delivers premium quality textile products.The scarves are available in two sizes: 20.5in square (Rosy, Winter Flowers, Bird of Paradise) and 36in square (Agave, Japanese Maple Leaves, Tulip Petals). They come in a tube package with a card of the original photo with caring instructions.What We Need & What You GetThe textile collections of tea towels and scarves are currently only available for wholesale.I need your help to produce the Nature’s Atelier line of textile collections and launch them on the retail market!My goal is to raise $20,000.00 to launch the production of silk scarves and tea towels. With your help I will be able to place orders for large and more cost-effective production runs.Raised funds will be allocated to:-  The cost of fabric printing and hemming-  Packaging and shipping expenses-  Marketing targeted at increasing awareness about Nature’s Atelier philosophy and products.-  Test new designs and products-  Research and test sustainable and innovative materials for our future productsI plan for Nature’s Atelier to be a sustainable business. For this reason I intend to ensure the best quality of my products and work with manufacturers that share my passion for quality and commitment to social responsibility.  New Bedford, MAFall River, MAThe use of digital printing allows for a photographic print with high amounts of detail and no limitations in color. This ensures the great quality in the reproduction of macro photography on my textile products. This type of printing also entails very little waste of fabric, ink, water or electricity. It uses eco-friendly, water-based inks on with no additional chemicals in the printing or preparation process.Nature's Atelier is committed to researching new sustainable materials to manufacture their products. With your support I will be able to test new materials and natural fabrics for our products such as hemp and bamboo. I also plan to offer vegan alternatives to the silk scarves for future collections, by testing prints on soy silk and ahimsa silk fabrics.You can help the Nature’s Atelier project grow into an ethically sensitive business and support my commitment to creating high quality products using sustainable methods.                                                                                                 $5 LilyA big thank you for your support and a surprise promotional code to be used for a future online purchase at Nature's Atelier!                                                                                                          $10 Daisy                                                                               $25 TulipOne 8x10 print of your choice mounted on single weight matboard signed on the back.

Risks & ChallengesThe manufacturing companies that will print and hem the scarves and tea towels are well known for the excellent quality of their work. I have created samples of the scarves and tea towels to test for quality of the products and was very impressed by the result. For this reason I am very confident that the manufacturing companies in US and Italy will deliver excellent products.The potential challenges that could arise may only be due to production delay for large orders that may take a bit longer, in particular for the scarves which will be hand hemmed in Italy. For this reason I have calculated enough time for the production, packaging, and delivery of the orders.In the event of potential production delays by my primary manufacturers I have already identified other manufacturing facilities who will be able to fulfill the orders. For the tea towel production they are located in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania and for the scarves production they are located near Como, Italy. In this way I will be able to avoid delays without compromising the quality of my products.                                                                  SHIPPINGPLEASE NOTE: Duty charges: If you reside outside of the USA, you will be responsible for any applicable duty charges applied at shipping.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you love this campaign but cannot contribute financially, you can still help Nature's Atelier succeed! You can endorse my project simply by sharing on Instagram and Facebook and sending an email to your friends & family. Share the love of nature and help me get the word out about Nature's Atelier!Don't forget to follow Nature’s Atelier on Instagram and Facebook for further updates; and if you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out to me at info@erikascilipoti.comThank you so much!Erika ScilipotiFounder",33.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Warp a Weaver relies on people like you to spread the word.  A fundraiser
is successful because you share and help it grow!  As you and others share this campaign widely, it will travel to thousands of homes and be a success!</p>
<p>Some of the yarns I weave with no longer have their labels.  In most cases I can easily distinguish linen, cottolin and cotton from one another.  Yet occasionally I may be fooled and a bit of cotton thread might trick me into believing it is linen or cottolin, thus finding it's way into a dish cloth.</p>
<p>Before and after the Immersion class, I will balance teaching music lessons, directing the Threshold Choir of Ann Arbor, running a household, living the good life, and weaving all the Perks.  It is a lot! I have friends and family supporting me emotionally, keeping the house
clean, offering occasional meals and singing with me to be up to the
challenge of remaining healthy, positive and fully embracing this project to
create a debt-free weaving education.  I've already started weaving dish cloths and towels as my thank-you to you and by my best estimation believe they will be completed by the end of November 2016.</p>

I am thrilled to be following my passion for the age-old
traditional art form of weaving and I want to invite you to join me. In
addition to the good feeling of supporting and sustaining this beautiful
tradition, I'd love to give you an original unique textile treat and/or
gifts of song (see full range of offerings both below and to the right for donations from $15 to
$2500). 


I am eager to attend weaving school debt-free and be able
to immediately come home and share this unique craft with our community. 
Thank you for your donation and encouraging your friends
to each donate, for example sharing this link on your FaceBook page would be a
big help.  And after you take a moment to donate and share with others I
hope you'll go sing, dance, play music, make art, go for a walk, enjoy nature,
and follow your passions whatever they are! 
 
 Go confidentially in the direction of your dreams!   Live the life you've imagined. ~Thoreau


The Väv Immersion  16 week weaving course is the only one of its kind in the USA.  I am
one of four weavers chosen to participate in this prestigious program. The class, which begins on February 1st in Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts, will focus on traditional and modern Swedish weaving, design and business skills for weavers.
During the past 15 years I've had great success as a beginning weaver.  With my basic skills I have been able to create gorgeous and practical dish cloths, tea towels, table runners, scarves, and blankets. Family and friends delight in using these heirloom-quality textiles on a daily basis.  I smile when loved ones are snuggled warm under a blanket I wove especially for them.  During the past few years I was surprised and encouraged when not just once, but twice, former weavers gifted me with their gently used Swedish Glimåkra Looms.

Funding Basics 

Crowdfunding allows people to follow their dreams without going into debt.  It's like the old-fashioned barn-raising...when we help others emotionally, physically, and financially, it's easier on everyone. And we are happier when we help one another!
My goal is to be debt-free.  The total estimated cost is $15,000.  This will cover the tuition, materials, room, board and transportation for the 16 weeks of class. 
Imagine if 100 people donated $150 - my goal would quickly be met!  Or if 300 people each shared $50!  
You can give at a level that is both comfortable and generous to you!  
And in return you not only know that I'm on my way to Vävstuga, you can choose from a beautiful handwoven dish cloth, tea towel or wool blanket to enjoy daily in your home.  There are also musical perks to delight your heart while singing and allow you to read music with ease.
When you donate, you will receive a thank-you note with a photo of my weaving, plus you will be invited to follow my weaving progress through my Warp a Weaver writings.  And upon my return you will be welcomed to an open house where you may view all the amazing textiles I wove at Vävstuga and celebrate the opening of my new cottage business!
The $$$ Details....

Course fee: $9,500
Materials fee: $ 1,000 - $3,000  (woven pieces will be charged by weight)
Room & partial board: $1,950 (breakfast for 16 weeks, lunch & supper for 7 weeks)
Additional board: $1,000 (lunch and supper, 9 weeks plus 16 weeks of food to meet dietary needs)
Travel: ?  ( transportation to Shelburne Falls, MA, from Ann Arbor, MI -  3 times - to get there and back plus returning home twice for the weeks of no class)

Risks
and Challenges


Warp a Weaver relies on people like you to spread the word.  A fundraiser
is successful because you share and help it grow!  As you and others share this campaign widely, it will travel to thousands of homes and be a success!
Some of the yarns I weave with no longer have their labels.  In most cases I can easily distinguish linen, cottolin and cotton from one another.  Yet occasionally I may be fooled and a bit of cotton thread might trick me into believing it is linen or cottolin, thus finding it's way into a dish cloth.
Before and after the Immersion class, I will balance teaching music lessons, directing the Threshold Choir of Ann Arbor, running a household, living the good life, and weaving all the Perks.  It is a lot! I have friends and family supporting me emotionally, keeping the house
clean, offering occasional meals and singing with me to be up to the
challenge of remaining healthy, positive and fully embracing this project to
create a debt-free weaving education.  I've already started weaving dish cloths and towels as my thank-you to you and by my best estimation believe they will be completed by the end of November 2016.

Other Ways You Can Help



Tell others about my campaign.  Share my story with friends, family, and even new people in your life.  Warp a Weaver! 
Write to me occasionally to remind me how awesome I am.
Share on Facebook, Email, and send a Tweet, use social media to tell ALL of your friends about Warp a Weaver!

Have lunch with Dan, he could use a bit of company for the 16 weeks I'm away weaving.

Cottage Weaving

Weaving nurtures me as an artist and is an amazing mental and physical activity!
My goal as a cottage weaver is to produce items for the home that are beautiful, practical and a joy to use.  I plan to continue my focus on textiles for the kitchen and bath along with warming scarves and blankets.  
Local fibersheds, where fiber is locally grown, processed and made into textiles all within a radius of 150 miles, are popping up all over the USA.  Several fiber artists are already selling locally created textiles in Ann Arbor.  I plan to work together with fiber farmers, processors and artists to create a Southeastern Michigan fibershed. 

And imagine your dreams...then bring them to life!



As soon as you take time to pursue a dream, your life wakes up and everything has meaning.  ~Barbara Sher

Take time to awaken your dreams and passions!  You deserve it!  Listen to your heart and become who you've always imagined!
Surround yourself with the dreamers and the doers, the believers and thinkers, but most of all, surround yourself with those who see the greatness within you, even when you don’t see it yourself. ~Edmund Lee



With gratitude to my loving, creative and supportive family!

do the cards facilitate deeper, clearer thinking?</b></p><div>
<p>There’s quite a bit of science behind them –
illustrated cards have been used throughout history to imagine different
versions of the future. Most of our deep thinking
goes on without us being conscious of it – metaphor works as a conduit to carry
this thinking out into our conscious thought stream. We use around 4 metaphors
a minute in normal speech – a metaphor carries over a complex concept in a
single word or phrase. These cards reverse that process – we begin with the picture/metaphor and use it to reveal all the hidden thinking that’s going on around
an idea or isuue. It’s such a simple and clever tool for generating useful stream
of ideas around any given topic.</p>

<p>Our Current project, is the “E.S.B.A. Initiative”, or more poetically, the “Eat, Sleep, Breathe, ART campaign” .</p> <ul> <li>
<p>My name is <b>Josiah</b> and I am the founder of <b>Can’t Get Right Entertainment </b>and these are the reasons I’m here.</p>
<p>Many know me by my work with lyricists over the past 7 years: producing, promoting and educating artists about the entertainment industry and the values of pursuing an <i>honest career</i> with a <i>positive message</i>.</p>
<p>For over 5 years, it has been my passion and personal endeavor to support independent entertainers of all varieties.</p>
<p>Making music has always been my passion, but experience has taught me that musical talent means nothing if its not recorded on the right equipment and properly promoted.  Since 2009 I've been back in my hometown of Oil City, Pennsylvania.  One of the first things I realized was that there isn't much left here.  During the 2nd World War, we were #3 on the Nazi list of American cities to destroy, because we made the Warheads on the American bombs.  We were an industrial community through and through.  Oil was discovered less than 20 miles away, and Oil Creek runs down our North Side into the Allegheny River.  Now, Quaker State is gone.  The Pennzoil Refinery is gone.  The factories are mostly gone.  The world changed quickly and Oil City wasn't prepared for it.  With no jobs to keep people here, especially young people with fresh ideas on how to spark growth in an area entirely in decline, our population has dwindled to a third of what it was in our prime.  Those who remain, with few other options, have turned to the arts.  Especially music.  Which led me to my second realization... there is too much talent here being allowed to waste away in poverty.</p>
<p>We aren't just asking you to buy a shirt, or get your name on a banner.  We don't want you to give a group of greedy people $12,200.  We are asking you to support aspiring artists and entrepreneurs that have nothing but music and art to turn to.  Give them the equipment they need to bring their ideas to life and therefore give meaning to their own.  We are asking you to do that, and get yourself an E.S.B.A t-shirt or hoodie to continue to show your support for those artists and entrepreneurs.  That is the impact you can make today.  </p>

Our Current project, is the “E.S.B.A. Initiative”, or more poetically, the “Eat, Sleep, Breathe, ART campaign” .  
My name is Josiah and I am the founder of Can’t Get Right Entertainment and these are the reasons I’m here.
Many know me by my work with lyricists over the past 7 years: producing, promoting and educating artists about the entertainment industry and the values of pursuing an honest career with a positive message.
For over 5 years, it has been my passion and personal endeavor to support independent entertainers of all varieties.
Making music has always been my passion, but experience has taught me that musical talent means nothing if its not recorded on the right equipment and properly promoted.  Since 2009 I've been back in my hometown of Oil City, Pennsylvania.  One of the first things I realized was that there isn't much left here.  During the 2nd World War, we were #3 on the Nazi list of American cities to destroy, because we made the Warheads on the American bombs.  We were an industrial community through and through.  Oil was discovered less than 20 miles away, and Oil Creek runs down our North Side into the Allegheny River.  Now, Quaker State is gone.  The Pennzoil Refinery is gone.  The factories are mostly gone.  The world changed quickly and Oil City wasn't prepared for it.  With no jobs to keep people here, especially young people with fresh ideas on how to spark growth in an area entirely in decline, our population has dwindled to a third of what it was in our prime.  Those who remain, with few other options, have turned to the arts.  Especially music.  Which led me to my second realization... there is too much talent here being allowed to waste away in poverty.
We aren't just asking you to buy a shirt, or get your name on a banner.  We don't want you to give a group of greedy people $12,200.  We are asking you to support aspiring artists and entrepreneurs that have nothing but music and art to turn to.  Give them the equipment they need to bring their ideas to life and therefore give meaning to their own.  We are asking you to do that, and get yourself an E.S.B.A t-shirt or hoodie to continue to show your support for those artists and entrepreneurs.  That is the impact you can make today.

<h3><b>OUR MISSION</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Articollectiva was created to showcase art in all its forms to the world. We curate and create pop-up, impromptu exhibits showcasing the most avant-garde, though-provoking, and beautiful work from emerging and established artists of all pedigrees. We work with painting, drawing, sculpture, spoken word, the performing arts, and even move beyond those parameters. We believe art is an expression where intellect, creativity, and imagination come together and materialize into universal communication. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We believe the artist and the audience matter the most. Art is a creative human endeavor where our personal genius is given room to shine. The majority of people do not get the chance to experience and enjoy this genius. They rarely get the opportunity to become a part of this genius either. Articollectiva's purpose is to change that. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Below are a few of the essentials that make up the Articollectiva DNA. They are the universal truths that drive us to create and share with the world:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<ol>
<li>Art belongs to the world.</li>
<li>Art is Universal expression.</li>
<li>Art is the most human language of communication.</li>
<li>Art is subjective and meant to be admired in a person's own time and space.</li>
<li>Artists and their work have an unquestionable right to be admired.</li>
<li>We are all creative beings with artistic potential as we deem fit<span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">.</span>

<span style=""background-color: initial;"">I am Lillian Moya, the founder of Articollectiva. My background is in the arts and began by using fine point black ink Pilot pens and white copy paper. I then decided I wanted to go to art school.</span>
</div>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div style=""text-align: left;"">While still in school I was given the chance to exhibit in NYC, Chelsea, and also Miami. I was invited to exhibit internationally with Carlos Mata, an Internationally renowned Cuban artist, but that was an impossibility. I found that being an artist was beautiful AND so difficult. There was so much talent amongst us, and so much of it was being unnoticed because we just did not have the means to connect to the right people or the right places.</div>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: left;"">So what did I find happens a lot of the time when art gets overlooked? When talent gets overlooked? Sometimes we find jobs in other industries. Sometimes, like I did, we go back to school to study something remotely ""stable"". I studied business. So now I work a lot, and have absolutely no time to work on anything creative.</div>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: left;"">Why does talent need to be overlooked? Why does the artist need to jump so many hurdles? Why can't we live in a world where art is supported by the same people who happen to buy art for their own pleasure? Articollectiva is not about creating a Utopian society where we can all sit back and paint, draw, act, sing. Why would we want to live in a world like that? Why would we want to live in a world where we don't have access to the pleasures the arts can bring us? </div>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: left;"">My goal, my greatest goal, with Articollectiva, is to allow art to shine. To bring talent back to the world. So, we don't want to b glued to our smartphones all the time. Or TV sets. Well, then lets help art happen! Art exists all around us, and we all love it in one way or another, whether we see it as art or not. Articollectiva is trying to shape the world so you have access to all of it. </div>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: left;"">You may want to call us disruptive, and essentially that may be exactly what we are. We are helping artists take back their world. What I mean by that is that too many hurdles need to be jumped to have your work exhibited, lets say. Too many times some recognition is post-humous. Many times, more than any other circumstance, amazing work, whether in painting, book, song, or the stage gets overlooked. It never gets noticed. So yes... we are disrupting what very few people have had access to for decades now, and making it available to the masses. We cannot do that without these events. This is why we need your help. </div>

<div style=""text-align: left;""><b><h3>THE ARTICOLLECTIVA GROWTH CAMPAIGN</h3></b></div>
<div style=""text-align: left;"">This story is why I founded Articollectiva. I found myself in a corner, and no matter how much I tried I still had almost nowhere to go. This campaign is solely for the purpose of helping Articollectiva move from it's hometown of Miami, Florida, to other cities where we can showcase amazing work by amazing artists of all kinds, and help bring art back to the world. Art is not about a sole convention once a year that many people cannot go to. It's not only about what we hear a piece sold for in a city we have never been to. </div>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: left;"">Art is experience. Art has the power to make you feel. It has the power to make you see, realize, think, do. Art does not only need to be on a canvas. It can be a beautiful chair, it can be a one-person dance where they express freedom and transfer that same feeling to the audience. Art can be a word that changes your life. Art can be anything. And art really is everything as long as we can see it. </div>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: left;"">Articollectiva is about art. It's about people. It's about all of us. That is what this growth campaign is about. It's about bringing those experiences, in any form we can find them, to the world. We will not be able to do it without you. You are a part of this experience too, and we need you to collaborate with us in the <span style=""background-color: initial;"">making of this art. </span>

<li>If we do not reach our goal the funds will still go towards growing Articollectiva, although it will need to be in a smaller scale. We will possibly need to move more slowly. Maybe rent smaller spaces. Maybe even offer different raffle prizes at the end of every event. The operational goal of the campaign does not change regardless of the monetary goal not being met. We are completely focused and determined to make Articollectiva the collective that empowers artists. </li>
<li><br/></li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>THE IMPACT YOU WILL MAKE</h3> <p>Articollectiva is an artist's collective created by artists, and because too many artists, and too much art, is overlooked. Whether we are in the wrong city, or know the wrong people, we want to give everyone that wants to create, and show their work, the chance to do so. That barrier that exists where artist and audience rarely come together, even if it's only with the piece causing the connection needs to be broken. The establishment that is art is one that is meant to be free of those barriers. People want to see art. They want to experience it. They want to become a part of it. Your contributions will help make this happen. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We curate pop-up exhibits. We work with artists and they work with us to make this happen. We do not have a gallery space. The purpose is to bring art to all of us. And for all of us to be in this art. </p>
<p><br/></p> <ul> <li>Art does not live in a vacuum. We each deserve to be inspired, to see and feel beauty. To experience wonder. This is our goal. To bring this to you. </li> <li>We inaugurated in 2015, in the Wynwood Art District in Miami. The show was a success. And everyone who exhibited and those in the audience loved the fusion of what Articollectiva offered them. The night was about the art and the audience's experience. It was about the artist. We simply helped put it together. Now we need your help to do it again, in other cities, and bring art back to life. Back to us.  </li> <li>Artists are the original innovators. They are the original disruptors of the world. They inspire. They dream. They create. And we are all a part of it. Without the world, every person in the world, Articollectiva would not exist. Our philosophy is based on the world. On the connections between us all, that help create magical moments, that sometimes get materialized into a representation to be shared with the remainder of those who were not there that first time - they are there now. We need you. We would not exist without you. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>

<li>The world becomes saturated with Articollectivas and we have too much competition to grab anyone's attention. </li>
<li>We are trilingual, so we can communicate in English, Spanish, and French.

<li>We are young, and just starting out, so we are eager to grow and evolve along with the world and those whom we work with. We are only set in the way of enjoying the beauty life has to share. In every other way we re ready to adapt for a more positive future.</li>

We are trilingual, so we can communicate in English, Spanish, and French. Luckily those languages are helpful, but we are extremely open to working and collaborating with others all around the world. Articollectiva is a global endeavor. It is a change we feel is necessary to bring some color back into our lives.
We are young, and just starting out, so we are eager to grow and evolve along with the world and those whom we work with. We are only set in the way of enjoying the beauty life has to share. In every other way we re ready to adapt for a more positive future.
We believe in those we work with, and want them to believe in us. The desire is endless, and we feel the need is abundant. That makes this an immense priority for us. 
This is the world we all belong to, and that being said, it matters a lot.

<p><i>Selamat
siang</i> everyone! We are Marina and Tea from Croatia and
we would like to present our project about picture scroll theatre – <a href=""https://wayangbeberproject.wordpress.com/2016/02/15/wayang-beber/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i><span>wayang
beber</span></i></a> – on the Indonesian island of Java. During our
study visits to Central Java we both became enthusiastic about this type of <i>wayang</i>
theatre and started writing down and documenting our experiences and this
research continued even after we got back home. Being cultural anthropologists
and new admirers of this art, our curiosity soon developed into a research
project. Based on the research we've done to date, we concluded that <i>wayang
beber</i> has not been given the attention it deserves. Considering that most
of the written documentation is in the Indonesian language and the documents in
English are outdated, we want to contribute with new research discoveries that
present the current state of <i>wayang beber</i> tradition. Additionally, we
want to create audiovisual documentation of this unique artistic tradition in
order to capture what would be lost with written descriptions alone. <br/></p><p><b>THE NEXT STEP IN OUR PROJECT is to go back to Central and East Java this summer and conduct our field research! </b><br/></p>

Since
this type of theatre combines many different artistic forms (music, painting,
audio-visual arts, singing, acting and storytelling), this has inspired us to
observe it and learn about it from different viewpoints and by collaborating
with local artists. Even though it is already defined as a dying art form, the qualities
of <i>wayang beber</i> (both in form and the philosophy behind it) still keep
on inspiring Javanese artists that are passionate about creating contemporary <i>wayang
beber</i> performances. This is why we believe that it is important to document
the old and the new forms of <i>wayang beber</i> and we need your help!<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461619672/2mala_b2vxuk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461619982/mala_metro_rjvk7i.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>History and modernity in <i>wayang beber</i> theatre</b></p><h4>

<p>We are happy to say that our project
has been recognized as worthy of support by the University of Oxford (Institute
of Social and Cultural Anthropology: <i>Philip Bagby fund - Small
research travel grant), </i>which will partially cover our travel expenses. Also, we
received the <i>Beasiswa
Unggulan Research Scholarship</i> from the Indonesian
Ministry of Education and Culture, which will cover most of our fieldwork
expenses and the second part of travel expenses. Hooray! </p>
<p>However,
there are two things we still need funds for:</p>
<p><b>1/ Technical

<p>We plan to rent a
small house for the two of us, for a period of 3 months in Yogyakarta. That will
cost us 250 USD in total! (3 x Rp 1.000.000 = Rp 3.000.000 = cca 250 USD) </p>
<p><b>TOTAL COST:
2.000,00 USD</b></p>
<p>Every contribution is of great importance for reaching our
goal, which we’ve tried to keep modest and realistic. In case we raise more
money than the current goal, we will use it for our exhibition in the
Ethnographic museum at the beginning of 2017 (printing photographs, creating

<h3><b>Your impact</b></h3>

By
supporting our research, you will help us create a database about this extraordinary
cultural and artistic practice for future generations. We want written and
audiovisual documentation about <i>wayang
beber </i>to be available to everyone, especially because it is seen as a dying
art form. We believe that the way this old and almost forgotten Javanese
theatre influenced the contemporary art scene on Java is a great example of
revitalizing intangible cultural heritage. Therefore, it can be seen as a
positive model of revitalization that can inspire others to be creative in
exploring and promoting their own heritage. Your contributions will also help
support these artists to continue their wonderful work and provide us all with
enjoyment as we watch history and the present come together in a uniquely
Javanese way. <br/><p><br/></p><p>

<h3><br/></h3>
<p>One day I wanted to know how I could play with the big boys and so I asked my WeLoveFine sales rep about getting exclusive rights to shirts. Shortly after this discussion, I saw JadedJynx’s Warrior Dash print and said to myself that would be an amazing shirt. I then contacted the amazing JadedJynx and we started discussing details back and forth. In the mean time I kept hearing complaints from artists feeling that they were not being compensated enough for the use of their art. This was not a complaint against their fans at all, they were extremely appreciative of their fans support. </p>
<p>One thing led to another and I discovered a few things that upset me and so I was even more determined than ever. It went from a project of, hey I want to have my own exclusive shirts for Littles Toy Company to sell, into now I am going to build a company that is going to truly be there for the artists.  I decided that it was time to pick a few artists brains to see what they thought was fair. I reached out to a bunch of artists and none were getting back to me, could have been busy prepping for conventions. A friend of mine told me to reach out to Leekfish and so I did. She was great and got back to me right away. We talked for a little while and pretty much had the same number in our minds. She helped to confirm what I was thinking. I reached out to JadedJynx with the offer and she accepted and so here we are.</p>
<p>We are trying to make the first joint effort between FandomWares (A Littles Toy Company subsidiary) and JadedJynx a reality. We need to be able to give WeLoveFine the total number of shirts, color and delivery date. So we are asking you, the fans, to reach out to us and let us know how many of you would love one of these amazing shirts. If you could also let us know what color shirt you think this design would look best  on, that would be amazing. We may only be able to offer one or two colors to start. If this is a successful start, we are looking to make this the first of a series. </p>
<p>Below you will find contact info, so that you may reserve your Warrior Dash shirt. We will not be collecting any money right away but we do ask you only reserve if you are serious about purchasing one. Sizes will range from Men’s small up to 3X-Large, we might be able to do a couple sizes larger if your interested just let us know. Once we get approval, we will send out invoices and ask for your shipping addresses. We are hoping to have these for BronyCon. Thanks so much for all of your support and for being part of such an amazing community.</p> <p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get (Donate What You Can, Any Support Is Greatly Appreciated)</h3> <p>We are looking to raise some start up capital so that this project can be a success. Any size donation will help to bring this project to life but if you make one of the minimum donations listed below you will secure yourself one of our exclusive shirts. Even if you are not a fan of this particular shirt we are working on, you can still donate and choose to receive a different shirt later on down the road. All you have to do is simply leave a comment with your donation stating I would like to receive a shirt of my choosing later on. We are currently having WeLoveFine manufacture the shirts for us. We compensate the artists for their design and we also give them a commission off of each shirt sold. Now you may ask, well what happens if this shirt is rejected by Hasbro and well that is an excellent question. If something happens and this shirt is indeed rejected by Hasbro, everyone who has donated enough to receive a shirt, will receive a certificate for one of our future shirts.  </p>
<p>$30 and up - You will get a shirt in your choice of size Small to X-Large - Shipping Included Within The United States.</p>
<p>$31 and up - If you need a shirt in a 2XL - Shipping Included Within The United States.</p>
<p>$32 and up - If you need a shirt in a 3XL - Shipping Included Within The United States.</p>
<p>Please feel free to reach out to us if you need an even larger shirt. We will be more than happy to see if that is available. </p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>Now you may be asking well what does it matter if we have another apparel company. It does matter and here is why. One of our main goals is to give artists many new opportunities that they may have not had before. Artists that may have some of the most amazing art, might be left out of so many amazing opportunities simply because they don't have the popularity behind them. We want to give those amazing artists the exposure they deserve. Another one of our goals is to have an open door policy. Whats an open door policy you might ask? Well, we want to make sure that artists speak their minds. We don't ever want an artist to feel like they can't speak out and let us know they are unhappy with something. This happens so often where the artist doesn't feel like they can talk to the company they are working with freely. They feel there may be some financial consequences and any future work could be lost. We want the artists we work with to constantly be giving us feedback on how we are doing. We also want to make sure that artists never feel like they have to compromise their art. If one of the licensing companies come back with requests to change the art, the artist in no way will be forced to do so. If they are not comfortable with the requests, we can simply terminate the project if the artist so chooses to. Last but not least, we want to create a charity fund so that we may be able to help out those artists who might struggling within the community. Maybe the artist doesn't know when their next meal is, we will be able to supply them with some funds to go and buy some groceries. Maybe the artist has a really important convention coming up and is a little shy for the cost of their table. Maybe they already paid for their table but now need that plane ticket and its just out of reach. We want to be able to step in and help out. </div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>I would say the biggest risk is not having the merchandise licensed and so that is why we are making sure everything we do is official. As far as challenges go, there will be legal fees, we may need to involve lawyers to try and help us out with the licensing process. Some big companies don't take you serious at first and so we may need to have lawyers draw up proposals. There may also be legal fees that may not involve the company directly. There may be that time that one of the artists within the community gets into legal trouble and is unfairly being picked on by big corporation A or B. We want to be able to step in and help out as much as possible. Last but not least, there is the challenge of denial, there is a possibility that some of the designs we submit will not be accepted by the companies we are trying to work with. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We know not everyone will be able to contribute money to our project but you can still help. Simply tell everyone and anyone what it is we are trying to do. Make sure to send them over the link to our indiegogo page. </p>

I wrote about my walk - being alone, long silences, lessons from nature and exchanging life philosophies with fellow pilgrims .And it bloomed into The Coloring Journal while hot air balloons drifted into the sunrise. Watching in silence while sunshine illuminated the landscape with vibrant hues of red and gold, my illustrator friend and I meditated on what had lead us here. What came to mind was my insomnia experience while working at an investment bank. To calm myself at night, I started coloring. Coloring became my therapeutic way of lowering anxiety and easing into a dreamless sleep (since pigging out on ice-cream would only add inches to my waistline and retail therapy reduce inches from my wallet). 
Inspired by the beauty before our eyes, we decided to combine our expertise to bring The Coloring Journal idea to full bloom.
Designed for the workaholic by day and insomniac by night, this book will  elevate your sunshine! Banish the dark forces of doom and gloom!When can I get my hands (color pencils) on this? So this is the Deal...For $5, three doses of sunshine in black and white for Gratitude, Peace and Compassion will be made available to backers in PDF format. Sunshine-in-progress examples here:Journal Specifications For $12,  you will receive one travel size (6x9 inches) Coloring Journal for you to bring sunshine wherever whenever. Thick white paper (120gsm) from environmentally friendly sources will be used to print 76 black and white pages of the book.Reaching for the Sun!$5000 is what we need to make hay while the sun shines. This is to cover the costs associated with design, marketing, printing and freight. What are the chances for any rain on this parade?The book is 100% complete! We started working on this book in October 2015. We will be working closely with a reputable printer to ensure the books are printed according to specifications.

<p>Hello, my name is Mark Andrew Webber.</p>
<p><b>A quick summary about this campaign. </b></p>
<p>My aim is to create a giant 4 meter X 4 meter hand-carved typographic Linocut city map of Tokyo. This campaign is to raise funds for the initial stage of the project, which is the Research Phase (learning the language, initial walking around the city, getting to know the city). During this time I will be exploring the city, taking photos of the typography, drawing and designing.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461073383/project_title_bxhbpd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p><b>About me and previous Maps</b></p>
<p>For me, there is something exciting about pushing limits and seeing just how far you can grow as a person. I'm an artist who is passionate about creating typographic city maps. Over the past 10 years I have created 5 city maps, each one pushing the boundaries of technique, size and complexity. I would like to push the limits of this latest map by increasing size, changing language and involving as many people in its creation as possible. That’s where you come in.</p>
<p> A video of me carving the latest city map I created ""Berlin"" can be seen here:</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FqNbgsTYabSA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DqNbgsTYabSA&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FqNbgsTYabSA%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>This was 5 months of carving:- 7 days a week for about 12 - 16 hours a day. There is nothing better than focusing on a project &amp; pushing yourself every single day. Including the Research Phase &amp; design, the whole project took about 18 months.</p>
<p>With ‘Berlin’ I was able to create an interactive art event, inviting members of the public to help print the first copies of the map. I will be doing this eventually with the Tokyo Map as well.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>I showed people how I inked up the plate, which took a few hours. I did get to make a couple of prints on my own with a spoon, and they took about 6 hours of spooning, to get the right amount of pressure equal over the whole Linocut.</p>
<p>My work is starting to gain some recognition in the wider Art and Design world And I do hope for that to continue. One of the highlights was when Erik Spiekermann paid a visit to the solo show to see progress of the map being printed.</p>

<p><b>How Your Support would help</b></p>
<p>With your support I will be able to complete this project ASAP! It would mean I could  invest full time into the project soon, rather than full time in however many years it takes. I'm determined to make the project a reality as it's my main focus in life. So getting your support on this would also mean a great deal personally. This project will also create a lot of different outcomes: Photography, timelapse footage, sketches, to public print events. Also the map created will be more like a puzzle so various size prints will be available. I hope as well that such a large scale project, would create some inspiration for others.</p>

<div>
<p>Challenge in walking the city for an extended period of time. I plan to be spending up to 8 hours a day walking. I have arthritis (currently non active) this may mean that I need to change my schedule and the way that I work, taking extra days of not walking and completing sketches and carvings whilst my body recovers.</p>
<p>Challenge in carving, This is a big map and will take a long time to carve. I estimate based on the Berlin map over a year of solid carving. There are techniques I have developed to reduce the pressure on my hands.</p>
<p>Challenge in learning the language. Japanese is a complex written and spoken language so to try to minimize that challenge as much as possible I have already started learning Japanese. Konnichiwa!</p>
<p>Challenge in finding big enough paper - I might end up having to make the paper myself.</p>

<p>Hello
Everyone!</p>
<p>We
are <a href=""http://iomakandal.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Io Makandal</a> ( South Africa ) and <a href=""http://samanthamcculloch.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Samantha McCulloch </a>( Australia
/ South Africa) and this is our story!</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We
met back in 2007 when we were starry eyed and eager students studying Fine Art-
an aspiration come true! Fast forward a few years when we graduated – We found
ourselves in the real world determined to keep our art practices alive. We were
both passionate about drawing, sculpture and interesting spaces and how we
could use those mediums to explore and share stories with the world. So we
began to collaborate on works together. Soon after as our collaboration was
budding, Samantha left South Africa to pursue her studies further, leaving
Makandal across the globe in South Africa. And so the <i>From Where I Was: A
Project in Parts</i> was born, working apart across the globe. We sent drawings and
objects to each other keeping the conversations going. Recently we found a way
to connect to each other’s studios through a surveillance camera, which became
a digital portal into each other’s spaces.</span></p>

<p>We
are both passionate, committed artists and devoted cultural practitioners. This
year we wanted to work together in the same space and invite the outside world
through our “portal” to join with us on our journey. And with that we present
the <i>4th part</i> of our project: <i>Bonus Space!</i></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><i>
</i></span></p>
<blockquote>""Bonus Space
takes its name from spaces designated public, but owned by the private sector
in New York City. It will explore questions of intimacy, movement, confinement,
ownership and instruction through sculpture, video, text, drawing and
performance work. Responding to ongoing contests over urban space and the
‘right to the city’, this project will offer a timely and critical reflection
on the conflicted nature of the public sphere in contemporary life. ""</blockquote>

help to make it happen<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This
is an extremely important opportunity to us as artists. The New York Art Residency
and Studios (NARS) Foundation is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit arts organization
committed to supporting emerging and mid career artists and curators from
around the world.  This intensive program brings
together gifted and creative minds from diverse backgrounds who are dedicated to inquiry and art-making, to generate the most stimulative and rigorous
environment possible for a concentrated period of artistic creation,
interaction, exchange, and development. Thousands of applicants apply each
year and we part of the fortunate (and grateful) few that have been
accepted ( yaaaaaay!). </span></p>
<h3>Why we're doing this</h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">At
the NARS Foundation we will have concentrated </span>time and space<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> to </span>realise <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">our site
specific project </span><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">Bonus Space</i><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">, create new work, connect with other artists and
curators in a foreign place, develop our practice by participating in an important experience
producing art away from home and to bring what we have experienced and learnt
back to Johannesburg! Samantha and I want to take full advantage of this
extremely awesome opportunity without getting ourselves into insurmountable
debt. We live on a humble and
tight budget at home and have been saving every extra penny for months. The
start of the residency date is drawing nearer and we need to reach out to our
global community for help to make this happen! </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">So
if you want to be a part of our journey and are in a position to contribute to our campaign and our project we will be immensely grateful for
your support. Any and every bit helps us get there and make a dream come true!
Thank you so much for your time and consideration.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Big
love,</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Samantha
and Makandal</span></p>
<h3>Why we need your help?</h3>
<div>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We've never asked for money like this before, but attending a residency like this as emerging artists is so important to our careers. We have a few small grants on our side, but we are still quite a way shy of our costs for the 3 month residency.</span><br/>
</div>
</div><div>
<div>
<b>We are aiming to raise $ 5000 in 4 weeks!</b> </div>
<div>The funds raised will help us pay our way while we are in residence and cover
costs for producing work.</div>
<div>
<b>If you donate </b>( yay &amp; thank you!) your money will go towards the following:</div>
<div><ul>
<li>The remaining cost of the NARS Foundation 
2016 Season III International Artist Residency
Program fee<br/>
</li>
<li>Transportation to and from the residency studio. We will endeavour to walk as much as possible but time is also precious!<br/>
</li>
<li>Travel costs from South Africa to USA. Ya... we look forward to the era in which one can teleport oneself from one place to another for free!<br/>
</li>
<li> Material and equipment costs to produce our project. We wish we were alchemists, but alas paper, drawing tools, resin, 32gb SD card, projector / screen hire, web design, cost money to make more amazing things!<br/>
</li>
<li>Basic Living expenses: Food and accommodation. Got to eat and have a good night's sleep to be bright and fresh to think and make!<br/>
</li>
<li>Museum / Gallery / Library cards so that we can explore, discover, research,  and expand our visual and literary horizon with the AMAZING Art galleries and collections in New York!<br/>
</li>
<li>Shipping costs to bring with studio materials and to send back works produced and materials back home.</li>
</ul></div>
<h3><b>We want to give back to you too- What you get!</b></h3> <p>For your generosity in donating and<i> investing</i> to our careers we are giving some sweet perks ranging from Little Thank you, Big Thank you, Big biggggg feel good thank you, to brilliant artworks and more!</p> </div> <div> <h3>Why this is important?</h3>
<div>Being an artist is a tricky profession ( We know many other professions are too, keep reading!) and often requires very clever creative problem solving to keep making our work and getting paid for it. Often it is only ourselves, friends and family (sometimes not even family) who root for us pushing our way through the world. Many question why we are artists if there are such high challenges on a day to day basis. Well, the truth is, we are born makers and story tellers. We are crazy, stupid <b>in love </b>with what we do and we give our lives for it. We put all our heart and soul into what we create and what we create is imbued with that love and shared with the world. Humans need art, questioning art, beautiful art, curious art, captivating art to be awed and instilled with wonder that connect us with our condition of being human.</div>
<div>This opportunity will launch our project on an international level, helping us grow our art practices and contribute to the growth of Contemporary South African art and cultural exchange at a significant and consequential time.</div>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help!</h3> <p>We understand, money is tight, but that doesn't mean you can't help us:</p> <ul> <li>Tell your friends!  Make some noise and share our campaign on social media!</li> <li>Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools to spread the word!</li> </ul>

year we wanted to work together in the same space and invite the outside world
through our “portal” to join with us on our journey. And with that we present
the 4th part of our project: Bonus Space!


""Bonus Space
takes its name from spaces designated public, but owned by the private sector
in New York City. It will explore questions of intimacy, movement, confinement,
ownership and instruction through sculpture, video, text, drawing and
performance work. Responding to ongoing contests over urban space and the
‘right to the city’, this project will offer a timely and critical reflection
on the conflicted nature of the public sphere in contemporary life. ""

 We have been accepted into the NARS Foundation International Residency Program (hooray! we are VERY excited) to conduct our new project, and we need your
help to make it happen!
This
is an extremely important opportunity to us as artists. The New York Art Residency
and Studios (NARS) Foundation is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit arts organization
committed to supporting emerging and mid career artists and curators from
around the world.  This intensive program brings
together gifted and creative minds from diverse backgrounds who are dedicated to inquiry and art-making, to generate the most stimulative and rigorous
environment possible for a concentrated period of artistic creation,
interaction, exchange, and development. Thousands of applicants apply each
year and we part of the fortunate (and grateful) few that have been
accepted ( yaaaaaay!). 
Why we're doing this
At
the NARS Foundation we will have concentrated time and space to realise our site
specific project Bonus Space, create new work, connect with other artists and
curators in a foreign place, develop our practice by participating in an important experience
producing art away from home and to bring what we have experienced and learnt
back to Johannesburg! Samantha and I want to take full advantage of this
extremely awesome opportunity without getting ourselves into insurmountable
debt. We live on a humble and
tight budget at home and have been saving every extra penny for months. The
start of the residency date is drawing nearer and we need to reach out to our
global community for help to make this happen! 
So
if you want to be a part of our journey and are in a position to contribute to our campaign and our project we will be immensely grateful for
your support. Any and every bit helps us get there and make a dream come true!
Thank you so much for your time and consideration.
Big
love,
Samantha
and Makandal
Why we need your help?

We've never asked for money like this before, but attending a residency like this as emerging artists is so important to our careers. We have a few small grants on our side, but we are still quite a way shy of our costs for the 3 month residency.



We are aiming to raise $ 5000 in 4 weeks! 
The funds raised will help us pay our way while we are in residence and cover
costs for producing work.

If you donate ( yay & thank you!) your money will go towards the following:

The remaining cost of the NARS Foundation 
2016 Season III International Artist Residency
Program fee

Transportation to and from the residency studio. We will endeavour to walk as much as possible but time is also precious!

Travel costs from South Africa to USA. Ya... we look forward to the era in which one can teleport oneself from one place to another for free!

 Material and equipment costs to produce our project. We wish we were alchemists, but alas paper, drawing tools, resin, 32gb SD card, projector / screen hire, web design, cost money to make more amazing things!

Basic Living expenses: Food and accommodation. Got to eat and have a good night's sleep to be bright and fresh to think and make!

Museum / Gallery / Library cards so that we can explore, discover, research,  and expand our visual and literary horizon with the AMAZING Art galleries and collections in New York!

Shipping costs to bring with studio materials and to send back works produced and materials back home.

We want to give back to you too- What you get! For your generosity in donating and investing to our careers we are giving some sweet perks ranging from Little Thank you, Big Thank you, Big biggggg feel good thank you, to brilliant artworks and more!   Why this is important?
Being an artist is a tricky profession ( We know many other professions are too, keep reading!) and often requires very clever creative problem solving to keep making our work and getting paid for it. Often it is only ourselves, friends and family (sometimes not even family) who root for us pushing our way through the world. Many question why we are artists if there are such high challenges on a day to day basis. Well, the truth is, we are born makers and story tellers. We are crazy, stupid in love with what we do and we give our lives for it. We put all our heart and soul into what we create and what we create is imbued with that love and shared with the world. Humans need art, questioning art, beautiful art, curious art, captivating art to be awed and instilled with wonder that connect us with our condition of being human.
This opportunity will launch our project on an international level, helping us grow our art practices and contribute to the growth of Contemporary South African art and cultural exchange at a significant and consequential time.

    Other Ways You Can Help! We understand, money is tight, but that doesn't mean you can't help us:  Tell your friends!  Make some noise and share our campaign on social media! Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools to spread the word!

<i><b>
</b></i><p><i><b>Welcome!</b><span><b> </b> Let me tell you WHAT my new book<b>, Kabbalat Shabbat: the Grand Unification</b>
is all about, and WHY it’s so very important that I’m asking for your help.</span></i></p>



The Friday evening gathering of friends and
family at synagogue, and at home around the dinner-table is the most cherished
moment of the week in Jewish culture. Warmth and conversation, great food and a
chance to breathe and rest after the busy work week…we receive Shabbat with all
of these, all interwoven with the inspirational poetry and song, known as
Kabbalat Shabbat, that lifts us to the heights of spiritual joy, that reconnect
us to the Divine.
<i><br/><br/><b><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FIhqkH69TpUI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DIhqkH69TpUI%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FIhqkH69TpUI%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/>
</b></i><b></b><p><b>This </b>exquisite book— at whose core are the paintings  like the ones in<b> </b>this video — presents these beloved
traditions, compiled by the Kabbalists of sixteenth century Israel in an
entirely new way! Not only is this<b> </b>the very first artistic presentation of
this poetry, it is the first attempt of any kind—either in paint or in words—to interpret the
liturgy in the light of the modern sciences that shape the world in which we
live every day. <b>Kabbalat Shabbat: the
Grand Unification</b> helps us understand this five-hundred (and more) year old
mystical tradition in a way that we, who live in the modern world shaped by
rational science, can relate to and love…and appreciate with our modern minds
as well as our traditional hearts. In our increasingly secular age, that offers
us a <b>how</b> of life, but not always a <b>why</b>, this lovingly-produced book helps
us probe the most fundamental questions of our spiritual lives in the light of
both concrete reality and spiritual quest.</p>
<p>Here's a taste!</p>

<i><b>
Who am I, and what’s this project all about?

</b></i><p>I’m <a href=""http://dbandart.com/about/artist-biography/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Debra
Band</a>, Hebrew manuscript artist and author of <i><a href=""mailto:http://dbandart.com/books/song-of-songs/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Song of
Songs: the Honeybee in the Garden</a></i>, <i><a href=""http://dbandart.com/books/psalms/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">I Will Wake the Dawn: Illuminated
Psalms</a></i>, and <i><a href=""t.com/books/arisearise-deborah-ruth-and-hannah"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Arise! Arise! Deborah,
Ruth and Hannah</a></i>, and creator of hundreds of original and limited
edition  <i><a href=""http://dbandart.com/ketubot/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ketubot</a></i> (Jewish
marriage documents).  My celebrated work
in Hebrew illuminated manuscripts draws upon my passions for the manuscript
arts and Jewish traditions and studies.  In the video above (with cockatiel)  you can watch over my shoulder as I paint, and you can read more about my background below.</p>
<p>New translations of the poetry and blessings have been done by the leading scholar of medieval Jewish poetry, <b>Raymond P. Scheindlin</b>, of the Jewish Theological Seminary, translator and author of many leading works on Hebrew poetry and Jewish liturgy. The world-renowned leader of the international Jewish community, and former Chief Rabbi of United Synagogue Great Britain, and prolific author, Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks, has contributed an elegant foreword, and the senior scholar of Jewish mysticism, Arthur Green, dean of the inter-denominational rabbinical school at Boston's Hebrew College, and author of many works on Jewish mysticism has prepared a preface for the work. <br/></p>
<p><span><b>Your help is essential in bringing</b> <a href=""http://dbandart.com/books/kabbalat-shabbat/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kabbalat Shabbat: the Grand
Unification</a> to light. This project is the most adventurous realization of my life-long twin
passions for fusing inspiring artwork with Jewish culture.  Each of my acclaimed books weaves my own
creativity together with Hebrew Bible, with midrash and other rabbinics, academic
bible and historical study, archeology and science—in partnership with leading
scholars of Jewish studies.  You may click on the links above
to learn more about me, about my earlier work, and most importantly 
about this project—and please help fund me to bring this important
(and luscious) book into the light in April 2016. I'm offering wonderful
 perks, topped by an original sterling silver, garnet and glass <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/dbandart/19215327874/in/dateposted-public/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">kiddush cup</a> designed by the wonderful silversmith, Ruth Shapiro, to accompany the book, available here for the first time. </span><br/></p>

<p><b>A Work of Love (not profit)!</b> This book, like all of my books, is a labor of love. Art
books, in particular religious art books are rarely profitable—far from
it.  Speaking from my own experience, all
three of my previous books, whether published by JPS or under my own imprint,
were entirely underwritten by major donors for the sake of their cultural
value. None were undertaken or financed with the expectation of eventual
profit, nor achieved it.  This project
has absorbed more than 2 years of my own time in painting, and more than that in
study and research. The funds that I am seeking to raise do not begin
to reimburse me or my collaborators for the months and years spent in creating artwork,
translations and commentary materials, nor the many hours of exacting
proof-reading and editing that have been so graciously offered gratis by
skilled friends.  Sales proceeds will
barely begin to be remuneration for the time and efforts absorbed by this
important project. Fortunately, my patrons, Steven and Sharon Lieberman,
appreciate this fully, and have funded actual printing costs with no
expectation of financial return.  Yet,
additional hard expenses above and beyond printing include: travel, materials ($3000 for calfskin vellum alone, ~$1500
in gold leaf, paints and other supplies), studio insurance and other studio expenses, book design, print
coordination, distribution expenses, shipping, marketing, advertising and
exhibit expenses. My work inspires such enduring enthusiasm among my readers
that I have welcomed the advent of crowd-sourcing as a democratic means of enabling my
readers, long-connected as well as new, to participate in the exciting process
of bringing such a work to light.  Each
of you will enjoy the satisfaction of knowing that you have participated in the
creation of a new landmark in contemporary Jewish culture.  I appreciate your support!<span><br/></span></p>

<b>More about the Authors</b><br/>I hold a
BA Honours in History from Concordia University in Montreal and an MS in
Political Science from MIT, and turned full attention to Hebrew manuscript arts
in 1987. My work grows from my childhood fascination with book illustration
 and the traditions of my family, an eminent  British rabbinic and

</p>
</div></div>","Welcome!  Let me tell you WHAT my new book, Kabbalat Shabbat: the Grand Unification
is all about, and WHY it’s so very important that I’m asking for your help.



The Friday evening gathering of friends and
family at synagogue, and at home around the dinner-table is the most cherished
moment of the week in Jewish culture. Warmth and conversation, great food and a
chance to breathe and rest after the busy work week…we receive Shabbat with all
of these, all interwoven with the inspirational poetry and song, known as
Kabbalat Shabbat, that lifts us to the heights of spiritual joy, that reconnect
us to the Divine.

This exquisite book— at whose core are the paintings  like the ones in this video — presents these beloved
traditions, compiled by the Kabbalists of sixteenth century Israel in an
entirely new way! Not only is this the very first artistic presentation of
this poetry, it is the first attempt of any kind—either in paint or in words—to interpret the
liturgy in the light of the modern sciences that shape the world in which we
live every day. Kabbalat Shabbat: the
Grand Unification helps us understand this five-hundred (and more) year old
mystical tradition in a way that we, who live in the modern world shaped by
rational science, can relate to and love…and appreciate with our modern minds
as well as our traditional hearts. In our increasingly secular age, that offers
us a how of life, but not always a why, this lovingly-produced book helps
us probe the most fundamental questions of our spiritual lives in the light of
both concrete reality and spiritual quest.
Here's a taste!

If you scroll down, you'll find other delightful 3 Minute Illumination Videos where I show and tell about certain illuminations of prayers and blessings in the book.
Let me tell you
something about myself and the amazing scholars collaborating with me,
and discuss why I’m asking you to contribute. 

Who am I, and what’s this project all about?

I’m Debra
Band, Hebrew manuscript artist and author of The Song of
Songs: the Honeybee in the Garden, I Will Wake the Dawn: Illuminated
Psalms, and Arise! Arise! Deborah,
Ruth and Hannah, and creator of hundreds of original and limited
edition  ketubot (Jewish
marriage documents).  My celebrated work
in Hebrew illuminated manuscripts draws upon my passions for the manuscript
arts and Jewish traditions and studies.  In the video above (with cockatiel)  you can watch over my shoulder as I paint, and you can read more about my background below.
New translations of the poetry and blessings have been done by the leading scholar of medieval Jewish poetry, Raymond P. Scheindlin, of the Jewish Theological Seminary, translator and author of many leading works on Hebrew poetry and Jewish liturgy. The world-renowned leader of the international Jewish community, and former Chief Rabbi of United Synagogue Great Britain, and prolific author, Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks, has contributed an elegant foreword, and the senior scholar of Jewish mysticism, Arthur Green, dean of the inter-denominational rabbinical school at Boston's Hebrew College, and author of many works on Jewish mysticism has prepared a preface for the work. 
Your help is essential in bringing Kabbalat Shabbat: the Grand
Unification to light. This project is the most adventurous realization of my life-long twin
passions for fusing inspiring artwork with Jewish culture.  Each of my acclaimed books weaves my own
creativity together with Hebrew Bible, with midrash and other rabbinics, academic
bible and historical study, archeology and science—in partnership with leading
scholars of Jewish studies.  You may click on the links above
to learn more about me, about my earlier work, and most importantly 
about this project—and please help fund me to bring this important
(and luscious) book into the light in April 2016. I'm offering wonderful
 perks, topped by an original sterling silver, garnet and glass kiddush cup designed by the wonderful silversmith, Ruth Shapiro, to accompany the book, available here for the first time. 





A Work of Love (not profit)! This book, like all of my books, is a labor of love. Art
books, in particular religious art books are rarely profitable—far from
it.  Speaking from my own experience, all
three of my previous books, whether published by JPS or under my own imprint,
were entirely underwritten by major donors for the sake of their cultural
value. None were undertaken or financed with the expectation of eventual
profit, nor achieved it.  This project
has absorbed more than 2 years of my own time in painting, and more than that in
study and research. The funds that I am seeking to raise do not begin
to reimburse me or my collaborators for the months and years spent in creating artwork,
translations and commentary materials, nor the many hours of exacting
proof-reading and editing that have been so graciously offered gratis by
skilled friends.  Sales proceeds will
barely begin to be remuneration for the time and efforts absorbed by this
important project. Fortunately, my patrons, Steven and Sharon Lieberman,
appreciate this fully, and have funded actual printing costs with no
expectation of financial return.  Yet,
additional hard expenses above and beyond printing include: travel, materials ($3000 for calfskin vellum alone, ~$1500
in gold leaf, paints and other supplies), studio insurance and other studio expenses, book design, print
coordination, distribution expenses, shipping, marketing, advertising and
exhibit expenses. My work inspires such enduring enthusiasm among my readers
that I have welcomed the advent of crowd-sourcing as a democratic means of enabling my
readers, long-connected as well as new, to participate in the exciting process
of bringing such a work to light.  Each
of you will enjoy the satisfaction of knowing that you have participated in the
creation of a new landmark in contemporary Jewish culture.  I appreciate your support!



If you'd like a taste of the way I meld all these kinds of thought into glowing and meaningful art, please come back often! I'm posting videos about different pairs of paintings every now and then over the next weeks. Enjoy...and then read on (and please contribute!)

More about the AuthorsI hold a
BA Honours in History from Concordia University in Montreal and an MS in
Political Science from MIT, and turned full attention to Hebrew manuscript arts
in 1987. My work grows from my childhood fascination with book illustration
 and the traditions of my family, an eminent  British rabbinic and 
scholarly line that goes back to the early Hasidic master, the 
Berditchever Rav.  Upon marrying my beloved late first husband, David, I
 acquired the renowned scholar of Hebrew literature, Arnold J. Band, not
 only as father-in-law, but also as my mentor. My extensive studies of 
Jewish texts, academic biblical studies, archeology, and research into 
medieval European and middle Eastern painting and manuscripts are 
fundamental to my art.  My work resides in exhibits, private collections,

review
activities at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland (my way of ""giving back"" in return for NIH staff's long years of superlative care of my beloved first husband). 
My collaborator, Raymond P. Scheindlin, who has prepared the poetry translations and literary commentaries 
is Professor of Medieval Hebrew Literature and director of
the Shalom Spiegel Institute of Medieval Hebrew Poetry,  Jewish Theological Seminary of America.  He is the author of Wine, Women and Death: Medieval Hebrew Poems on the Good Life; The Gazelle: Medieval Hebrew Poetry on God,
Israel and the Soul; A Short History

and a verse translation of the Book of Job.

</div><div> <p>Since I was a kid, I have never used Kleenex. My parents could barely feed us, let alone provide such costly luxuries. As I got older I never bought Kleenex, but always had to buy toilet paper. Even now that I'm married, I still go for the TP, knowing there are only 50 sheets in a box of Kleenex, while there are 330 sheets in a roll of TP.  Plus, a box of Kleenex can cost $2.50 while a roll of TP  is $0.25 cents.  That's an 800% difference in cost! Designing a tissue box that uses TP rolls made perfect sense!</p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Challenges</h3> <p>My biggest challenge was getting a patent.  Now that that's accomplished, we need to get the word out.  When people hear about TP-TOO, they totally get it.  All of us, rich or poor, have blown our noses on toilet paper, and now we can help cut the excess use of paper materials from using tissue boxes. With your help, we can get this to the big-box stores and start protecting the environment and our beautiful trees.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you believe TP-TOO is a  great product that improves the way we use toilet paper (something we can't live without), please help me spread the word by sharing it with friends, family, and social media.  </p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise money to manufacture and market TP-TOO. It will be ""MADE IN THE USA"" because I strongly believe Americans should make things in America. That's what made this country so great.</p>
<p>To thank you, we are offering a special discount to all who participate in this project.</p>
<p>I am confident you will love TP-TOO and that it will benefit your everyday needs. We will continue to move forward with this product until our goal is met. TP-TOO is fully patented and will become a house-hold name. </p>

</div></div>","Hi, I'm Ron Montoya 

For the past 35 years I have owned and operated many businesses, including sporting goods, software, and color cosmetics. I have always had a passion for creating products that would truly help people. TP-TOO is one of those products.  Not only will you save money, you will greatly help the environment by eliminating  the use of tissue cardboard boxes, and begin recycling toilet paper tubes. There are over 17 billion TP tubes thrown away each year. That’s enough to fill the Empire State Building. Twice!!  That doesn't include the billions of boxes that are also thrown away. That's a lot of trees that turn into a lot of trash :-(   


TP-TOO is made of recycled plastic that can be used over and over again.  Join the cause. Be environmentally smart, while saving money on something that you use everyday. 


   
The Impact

 Since I was a kid, I have never used Kleenex. My parents could barely feed us, let alone provide such costly luxuries. As I got older I never bought Kleenex, but always had to buy toilet paper. Even now that I'm married, I still go for the TP, knowing there are only 50 sheets in a box of Kleenex, while there are 330 sheets in a roll of TP.  Plus, a box of Kleenex can cost $2.50 while a roll of TP  is $0.25 cents.  That's an 800% difference in cost! Designing a tissue box that uses TP rolls made perfect sense!


    Challenges My biggest challenge was getting a patent.  Now that that's accomplished, we need to get the word out.  When people hear about TP-TOO, they totally get it.  All of us, rich or poor, have blown our noses on toilet paper, and now we can help cut the excess use of paper materials from using tissue boxes. With your help, we can get this to the big-box stores and start protecting the environment and our beautiful trees.
    Other Ways You Can Help If you believe TP-TOO is a  great product that improves the way we use toilet paper (something we can't live without), please help me spread the word by sharing it with friends, family, and social media.  
Thank you.

What We Need & What You Get
We need to raise money to manufacture and market TP-TOO. It will be ""MADE IN THE USA"" because I strongly believe Americans should make things in America. That's what made this country so great.
To thank you, we are offering a special discount to all who participate in this project.
I am confident you will love TP-TOO and that it will benefit your everyday needs. We will continue to move forward with this product until our goal is met. TP-TOO is fully patented and will become a house-hold name. 


Purchase The Economy Pack of 3 For $20.00 (regularly $7.95ea)
This rugged little box can go anywhere in your house, office, or even your car! Unlike regular tissue box covers, this has a bottom so the paper will not fall out. It loads from the top and is covered by a lid. Made of high-impact plastic, it is virtually indestructible and designed to last a long time. It will save you money, shopping time, and a whole lot of trees!!  Great for every room of your house, apartment, office, or work space.

<li>$1,000 - Mini Mimsy - a 1.25 meter chandelier version of Mimsy. This was critical for prototyping our designs, and also serves as a stand-alone art piece that can easily travel to smaller festivals and events. You may already have seen it at Steampunk Masquerade or Priceless.</li>
<li>$5,000 - Steel Structure - a custom fabricated 12’ diameter, 800 pound steel structure that meets all reasonable safety criteria for a dozen hippies clamber over it.</li>
<li>$1,000 - Electronics - the majority of our blinkies are recycled from Dr. Brainlove, greatly reducing costs. Despite this, new art has specific needs, old parts need replacing, and there’s a surprising amount of consumables from year to year.</li>
<li>$6,000 - Platform </li>
<li>$1,000 - Comforts - All the finishing touches that make an art car feel like home: shade, plush, signage, night vision cameras… Seriously, who’s going to ride an art car without shade?!?</li>
<li>$500 - Transportation - fuel, registration, insurance, the usual.</li>
<li>$500 - Rent in SOMA</li>
</ul><p> </p><h3>Risks and Challenges</h3><ol>
<li>Building an art car from scratch: we do not plan to use a base vehicle for Mimsy. In addition to being drivable, Mimsy needs to safely support around 30 people climbing on it. Luckily, we’re in good hands. The team building Mimsy has successfully constructed two other awesome art cars, Dr. Brainlove and Strangelove.</li>
<li>Mimsy needs to pass DMV inspection at BRC: As is true for all mutant vehicles, there is a small possibility Burning Man's DMV does not grant us a license to drive on the playa. Our project is pre-approved, and we are following all regulations, so we expect the process to go smoothly. If our license is not granted, Mimsy will be moored at the front lawn of The Phage camp as an art installation. Even while stationary, she will serve as an amazing dancespace, interactive climbing structure, and a science education platform!</li>
</ol><p> </p><h3>Beyond Burning Man</h3><p><strong>Education</strong></p><p>Mimsy is the perfect vehicle (ha) for STEAM education. We plan to build a smaller, stable version of Mimsy to use for education and outreach, and we’re currently exploring venues to do this through.

Callooh! Callay!At last, the thing we sought!We found it, here, alone, in fear.We found it lost, in thought...... introducing Mimsy.Meet MimsyMimsy is an interactive, geometric light sculpture and art car, debuting at Burning Man 2017. Its structure is made of a 12’ diameter dodecahedron enclosing ten intersecting tetrahedra, each uniquely oriented. Steel fabrication of its frame enables the adventurous to climb around and up top, experiencing geometry like never before.Mini-Mimsy, a fun-sized prototype and test buildThe team assembling Mimsy's skeleton at our build space in Oakland!12,000 3D-mapped LEDs dazzle the viewer with custom patterns, including the world’s blinkiest math lessons. The polyhedron itself has a symmetry order of 120, creating a 3D kaleidoscope-like effect. The node-edge construction enables visualization of graph theory, including Dijkstra’s Algorithm or Hamiltonian Paths. In addition to these new features, our collection of beautiful abstract patterns from Dr. Brainlove is expanding as well!Renderings of Mimsy's structure-- looking good from every angleMimsy at Priceless-- still missing a few thousand LEDs and the car bitsThis structure rests on a purpose-built mobile platform with electric drive train, hovering to and fro across the landscape. Befitting the brainchild of Dr. Brainlove, Frabjous, and the Mathematicians of The Phage, Mimsy is on a mission to infect the playa with a love of curiosity and discovery!The venerable Dr. BrainloveWhere will the money go?We're raising $8,000  to make Mimsy a reality!We estimate about $15,000 in total costs for Mimsy, which will cover:
$1,000 - Mini Mimsy - a 1.25 meter chandelier version of Mimsy. This was critical for prototyping our designs, and also serves as a stand-alone art piece that can easily travel to smaller festivals and events. You may already have seen it at Steampunk Masquerade or Priceless.
$5,000 - Steel Structure - a custom fabricated 12’ diameter, 800 pound steel structure that meets all reasonable safety criteria for a dozen hippies clamber over it.
$1,000 - Electronics - the majority of our blinkies are recycled from Dr. Brainlove, greatly reducing costs. Despite this, new art has specific needs, old parts need replacing, and there’s a surprising amount of consumables from year to year.
$6,000 - Platform 
$1,000 - Comforts - All the finishing touches that make an art car feel like home: shade, plush, signage, night vision cameras… Seriously, who’s going to ride an art car without shade?!?
$500 - Transportation - fuel, registration, insurance, the usual.
$500 - Rent in SOMA
 Risks and Challenges
Building an art car from scratch: we do not plan to use a base vehicle for Mimsy. In addition to being drivable, Mimsy needs to safely support around 30 people climbing on it. Luckily, we’re in good hands. The team building Mimsy has successfully constructed two other awesome art cars, Dr. Brainlove and Strangelove.
Mimsy needs to pass DMV inspection at BRC: As is true for all mutant vehicles, there is a small possibility Burning Man's DMV does not grant us a license to drive on the playa. Our project is pre-approved, and we are following all regulations, so we expect the process to go smoothly. If our license is not granted, Mimsy will be moored at the front lawn of The Phage camp as an art installation. Even while stationary, she will serve as an amazing dancespace, interactive climbing structure, and a science education platform!
 Beyond Burning ManEducationMimsy is the perfect vehicle (ha) for STEAM education. We plan to build a smaller, stable version of Mimsy to use for education and outreach, and we’re currently exploring venues to do this through. Also, we previously did a panel at SXSW about Brainlove, which we’d love to do again with Mimsy.Share the loveThe Strangelove/Brainlove/Mimsy family would like to start a sort of lending library of bits and pieces that are useful in building cool things with LEDs.

<p><br/>Hello. My name is Dawid Planeta. </p>
<p>The story is simple, so I'll make it short.</p>
<p>Last year I became depressed. Nothing seemed to have a purpose. Nothing was exciting. My relationship started to fall apart and I was not able to care.</p>
<p>I started to look for something to distract me from negative thinking. I turned towards art, since that's something I've always been good at.</p>
<p>Quickly I found excitement in depicting dark and mysterious depths of my mind. It helped me realize what am I afraid of. I learned a lot.</p>
<p>I posted some pictures on the internet. I didn't expect anything. I didn't think about my art as something amazing. I didn't expect anybody to like it.</p>

<p><br/>After asking some questions and getting some answers, I knew that in order to take part in the festival I have to pay a fee, pay for a catalogue, print my works, take them to China, stay there for five days and then come back.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! I'm Shruti Dandekar and I'm a quilter based in a small town Sangli in Maharashtra, India.<br/>You can find me on my website <a href=""http://www.shrutidandekar.com%C2%A0and"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.shrutidandekar.com&amp;nbsp;and</a> my blog <a href=""http://www.13woodhouseroad.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.13woodhouseroad.com</a><br/>I am currently a BERNINA Brand Ambassador, an AURIFIL artisan as well as the SAQA Regional Representative for India and SE Asia.</p>
<p>I was a speaker at QuiltCon 2017 (Savannah, GA,USA) where I spoke about ""Quilting in India : A review of Siddi Quilts of Karnataka, Godhadis of Maharashtra and Contemporary Quiltmaking in India"". The lecture was well attended and received rave reviews.</p>
<p>What I had not foreseen, while researching for my lecture, is the fact that it will generate a thirst in me. A thirst to find out more about the many different regional styles of India. There is so much to be explored! India is a country where the dialect changes every 50 kilometers! The variety in other forms of culture are reflected in the Quilts too.</p>
<p>That is where the dream started to build. A dream to explore the unknown territory. To collect quilts from the quaint towns of India and to build an exhibition of them. And then to travel the world with my exhibit and show it off, proudly! A dream to sell these quilts and make sure that the money raised goes back to the maker, without a chain of middlemen!</p>
<p>You can help me realize this dream.</p>
<p>You can help me bring recognition to the unknown artist from the quaint village of India.</p>
<p>You can help me put them on the international quilting platform.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need $8000 to cover the expenses of travelling to these small pockets of rural India and to buy the quilts from the makers. A lot of them are reluctant to even sell them. I will take care of the persuasion myself.</p>
<p>I will then create a travelling exhibit of these quilts and send them worldwide for people to see. Whenever possible, I will try to travel with it myself so that I can explain the history and the story behind every quilt and every style. </p>
<p>I will also attach a label to the quilt with a picture of the maker and their story!</p>
<p>In return, for your generosity, I will send you various stuff, as per your contribution, that will remain with you as a memory of the wonderful cause that you supported!</p>
<p>If I don't reach my entire goal, I will use the money that I have raised to visit and buy as many quilts as I can and create a travelling exhibit of the same!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The makers of these quilts, come from the lowliest of the financial level from extremely rural India. Sometimes, they are not even accepted in the mainstream society due to caste or race based discrimination.</p>
<p>If these makers are empowered financially, by making sure that they get a fair share of the price the quilt is sold at, the households will also be empowered.</p>
<p>It will mean better clothes for families to wear. Better education for the kids. Safer houses for the families!</p>
<p>Getting these quilts on the International platform will also provide them with the glamour that they need. More and more youngsters will start learning this dying art form just to get their picture on the Quilt label.</p>
<p>Even a small donation by you will help me save a dying art form in India.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I am funding a large part of the project from my own income. For me, this project is much more than just an exhibition. It is finally an opportunity for me to do something for the society that has brought me up! </p>
<p>I have grown up sleeping under a Godhadi made by my grandmother from her old sarees. I want the children of the next generation to enjoy the warmth of these quilts. I want them to feel safe when their moms tuck them in bed because their quilt ""smells like grandma"" for years to come!!!</p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
</div><div>
<p>Spread the word! Share with everyone around you! The more people you reach out to, the more quilt-makers we can help!!!</p>
<p>Find a show where I can send the exhibit to!</p>
<p>Invite me to come talk about them!</p>

<h2>What is the WombShip Temple?</h2>
<p>We all come from wombs. We all have our own connection with divine feminine.  This space is a sacred place to honor Yin.  It's important to find our inner softness and connection to goddess, especially during times of transition.  </p>
<p>Overlooking the Eclipse stage, up on the hill.  During the day, Eclipse Chasers can take a bit of time to slow down and look inwards.  This space is a bit off to the side on the far side of the lake, so visitors can have a bit more room to relax and let go.   </p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>We need your donation to make sure we can finish our Temple.  In exchange for your contribution, we would like to share necklace medallions that use the art by Joma Sipe that we are etching into some our windows.  </p>

<p><strong>Who we are and what is modestly ambitious</strong></p>
<p>modestly ambitious will be the studio space of three international artists: Katerina Eleftheriadou, Greece, works in sculpture introducing socially aware themes through her choice of materials shifting them through her prism of experiences. Riikka Enne is a Finnish born artist working in sculpture and performance. Her work examines the gap between an individual’s experience and the tensions of society through identity politics and material contradictions. Sophia Moffa, born in Italy, works in video, performance and sculpture. She is interested in the relations and tensions between the body, and the socio-political and technological events surrounding society. All three artists came to UK to study in the Manchester School of Art and out of common love for the city, decided to stay and launch their own space.</p>
<p>These three women will pull their resources and passion for contemporary art to host exhibitions and collaborative events. modestly ambitious will offer a space for experimental poetry, music and performance with Manchester based artists to work in collaboration with fine art or to venture deep into their own fields to pull out fresh work. Eleftheriadou, Enne and Moffa combined have exhibited in Europe, Asia and North America with many different galleries and artist lead initiatives. They will invite artists from around the world to take part into modestly ambitious’ residency program and create exchange with international artists to import and export contemporary art. modestly ambitious is dedicated to internationalism in the post brexit uk.</p> <p>With your help, we can create a new platform in Manchester to promote and enjoy a variety of art. Whether you are an artist or an art lover from Manchester or beyond, modestly ambitious is worth the look. With your donation you have the chance to support contemporary artists, contribute to the art scene in Manchester and appropriate art for yourself through our perks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What your donation will help to achieve</strong></p>
<p>We are currently acquiring a space in Northern Manchester, an old general practitioner's office that has character and offers an excellent space for everything modestly ambitious will need. We are currently trying to acquire the space of our dreams as a meanwhile use space to keep running costs low. Our initial budget, £5000, is reserved for transforming the space into a professional and functioning art space. We have reserved money towards advertising the initiative and to set up our first exhibition.</p>
<p>We are looking into other forms of funding, e.g. grants and self-funding, but we need your help to get us of the ground! The more we are able to raise with your help, the more security we have in our firsts steps as a new initiative. Every penny raised will go into the maintenance of the space and running our programs (exhibitions and residency)</p>
<p>Eleftheriadou, Enne and Moffa have a varied skill set that will allow them to run the space successfully: Eleftheriadou has organized community workshops in the Centre for Chinese Contemporary Art in Manchester, worked as curator Marianna Tsionki’s assistant for Modus Operandi in Grosvenor Gallery, Manchester and she worked in educational art programs in Children’s Art Museum in Athens amongst others. Enne has set up exhibitions in private and public institutions like Sprengel Museum (Hannover), Icon Gallery (Birmingham) and TR1 Taidehalli (Tampere) to name a few. She has worked in publicity campaigns for films, exhibitions and co-ordinated pop-up art events. Moffa worked as artist assistant for Atelier Van Lieshout in Rotterdam and Micheal Sailstorfer in Berlin. She also worked in CANVASS in Singapore to facilitate art workshops. Between them they have experience of facilitating, co-ordinating, curating, event planning, publicity and loads more. They have not only exhibited but worked internationally, which inspired them to launch an international residency program. To find out more about their past experience you can find their selected works and CV on their websites:</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>For the BlackExcellence: #ALLABOUTHAIR project to run smoothly without having to cut corners, we will need $1,000 to effectively complete the project.</p>
<p>40% of the funding will be going to renting the proper equipment (lighting, backdrop) and renting a studio to be able to shoot the project.</p>
<p>30% will be going to paying the crew who will be making the project come to life.</p>
<p>The remaining 30% will be going to printing physical works to be placed in various art galleries and online marketing.</p>
<p>If we <strong>DO NOT </strong>reach the entire goal, the funding will still be applied to the project but at a later date or we will have to make things happen on a limited budget!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The <i>BlackExcellence: #ALLABOUTHAIR</i> project aims to inspire young African-Americans to work hard to achieve their goals by seeing someone young, and someone who looks like them achieving their goals and embracing their natural beauty. With Cambry's other 2 platforms, this project would be an addition to assisting the young black community in a positive light but also be driven to be received by a much larger audience.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest risk with this project is not being able to complete the project in time for Black History Month due to this lack of funding and support. This is why we need <strong>YOUR</strong> help! Our turnaround time for having our content shot, sent to online publications, and released will be fairly quick but if we do not have proper funds that could delay the project! We plan to overcome these issues by receiving volunteer help instead of paid work but we want to be able to give to the future of black creatives and black businesses.

<h3><i>The Exhibit/La Exposición</i></h3>
<p>Twenty-five years ago, the Salvadoran Civil War officially ended. The ghost of that war, fought between the FMLN guerrillas and the right-wing, U.S.-backed government, remains today. Mass migration, violence, and demands for justice continue to impact the lives of those who stayed in El Salvador, as well as those who fled to other Latin American countries and the United States. Re:Construcción is an effort to archive these histories through critical conversations and art. The exhibit is a transnational collaboration between individual artists, collectives, and community organizations that work with Salvadorans across the United States and El Salvador.</p>
<p>Exhibits will premier in Brentwood; Hempstead; Queens; Brooklyn; Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles; and El Salvador. We have partnered with community spaces to help present the work and host events, including Latin American Youth Center, Brentwood's Salvadoran Consulate, MayDay Space, and CARECEN Los Angeles. Re:Construcción is the result of two years of planning, discussion, and collaboration. Our hope is that the exhibit can serve as a space of reflection and conversation about the effects of the war, diaspora, and contemporary issues facing Salvadorans in El Salvador and the United States.</p>

<p>This cause is to enable me create and insure my classic unproduced art sketches in 2D painting so as for the world to experience my unseen art, the art that made me in a traditional manner, Paintings drawn from an extensive collection of 115 works and reveals the impressive result of more than ten years of dedicated art production. With a limited travel insurance budget and production material I will only be able to produce 18 large paintings.  The project is involving people from Europe to reach classical art paintings from Africa so that they may be touched and felt, both in exhibitions and in people's homes</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The exhibition places represents Destreet’s original compositions in semi-abstract, inspired by the highly expressive painterly explorations of André Butzer, with the unclear lines and freestyle of Jackson Pollock, and the tight grids and optical illusions of Heimo Zobernig. The dramatic painterly movements customized by Destreet are unified by his enthusiasm for intense color and bold expressive gestures. ‘My Unseen Art’ is an invitation to witness one of east Africa’s most renowned visual Artists.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>""It would be a revolution to get blind people going to art galleries, people hate them because there is nothing there to touch!"" though in my early stages as an artist with no professional painting materials I used to force a surface on plain paper while sketching and  I touch the paper to feel the lines  and intensity.</p>

<p><strong>Your contribution will give people the opportunity to experience paintings for the first time in their lives.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Many people around the world have heard or seen my artworks or even purchased one as a gift but never been able to see the original works which healed my soul when I failed to get scholarship to pursue my engineering bachelor.  Very few in the world have ever touched any of them.</p>

<p>If you love art, supporting the campaign will give you a beautiful rendition of a masterpiece of art you can touch, experience different texture and eco fabric, and display as a unique part of a home or office.</p>

With a limited travel insurance budget and production material I will only be able to produce 18 large paintings.  The project is involving people from Europe to reach classical art paintings from Africa so that they may be touched and felt, both in exhibitions and in people's homes
 
The exhibition places represents Destreet’s original compositions in semi-abstract, inspired by the highly expressive painterly explorations of André Butzer, with the unclear lines and freestyle of Jackson Pollock, and the tight grids and optical illusions of Heimo Zobernig. The dramatic painterly movements customized by Destreet are unified by his enthusiasm for intense color and bold expressive gestures. ‘My Unseen Art’ is an invitation to witness one of east Africa’s most renowned visual Artists.
 
""It would be a revolution to get blind people going to art galleries, people hate them because there is nothing there to touch!"" though in my early stages as an artist with no professional painting materials I used to force a surface on plain paper while sketching and  I touch the paper to feel the lines  and intensity.
 
 
Your contribution will give people the opportunity to experience paintings for the first time in their lives.
 
Many people around the world have heard or seen my artworks or even purchased one as a gift but never been able to see the original works which healed my soul when I failed to get scholarship to pursue my engineering bachelor.  Very few in the world have ever touched any of them.
 
If you love art, supporting the campaign will give you a beautiful rendition of a masterpiece of art you can touch, experience different texture and eco fabric, and display as a unique part of a home or office.
If you know or love a visually impaired art lover, you can give them a piece of art to experience what the traditional Ugandan fabric used to be for the first time, and make it more accessible for everyone around the world.
 
If you work in an office or own a business, a striking and unique artwork can impress and show philanthropy to your customers and partners.
 
A small contribution and a referral to your friends will make a great difference in my social artistic lives and enable me showcase in various cities in Europe my new works as well as give free practical art workshops. 
 
Anyone will be able to experience them for the first time through touch, and create their own impressions and opinions during the exhibition closing creative workshops.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are the University of Manitoba production class and we invite you to contribute to the development of future Manitoba filmmakers and a psychological thriller-in-the-making. Our campaign is to fundraise for the feature film we are creating this year which involves the exploration of the interior mind-scape of a troubled young woman and the dire implications of not knowing how to reach out for help. We hope you will take part in helping us to achieve a professional level production!<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The film explores the psychological entrapment of a young woman when she cannot reach out to gain necessary support. The film endeavours to enter into challenging and dark emotional territory. and our goal is to create that tension between sensitivity and surrealism that is found in the best of the psychological thriller genre.<br/><br/>With heavy topics to explore, we anticipate that there will be challenges. Fortunately, most members of our creative team have worked on other productions and have the experience necessary to see the project through to completion, and to produce a quality film. Many of us have also worked in professional settings in design, acting, cinematography and the list goes on. All in all, we have a highly skilled team that is ready to make a memorable film experience! <br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why we need your help!</h3>
<p>We are working with a very low budget. Our cast and crew will not be paid for this production, as it is generated within a university class. We are utilizing as many resources from our cast and crew as possible in order to lower our expenses. </p>

<p>InGenieous debuted at the regional burn Lakes of Fire 2018 - and we burned plenty of midnight oil to get it there!  After a wonderful outpouring of support, we’re making improvements from our own wish list to get things ready for the Black Rock City!  To make the magic go even further, we need your help, fellow Djinns and Genies! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>InGenieous is a collaboration between artistic and life partners Matt Helsel and Annie Framstad and a uniquely skilled team of Chicago Burners.  Matt is a union iron worker who has built and had a hand (and heart) in designing art pieces from The Midwest to the playa and back again. Annie is a multidisciplinary artist whose art focuses on fabric design, interaction, and creating spaces and ambiance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We’ve self-funded this project up to this point, and we’ve realized in building a gift for our community, we can only do so much without the help of our community. Please donate some money to InGenieous if you can, and if you can’t please share our campaign with your friends and help us reach our goal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All the funds we raise will go directly to transportation costs, energy costs to keep the interior air conditioned, completing the gold cover made of vinyl and finishing up all the other details we have on our wish list!  Funding this project is co-creating an intentional space based around gifting and civic engagement.

<h3>Art supporting the environment</h3>
<p>I will create a series of eight woodcut prints featuring the forest's iconic wiliwili tree, along with other important endemic species of shrubs, trees, flowers and grasses that inhabit this special place.  An artist's statement telling the story of the plants and ecosystem depicted in each image will be displayed with each print. A special community exhibition will be held to celebrate the project and introduce the Waikoloa Dry Forest to more people. 20% of the contributions will be donated to The Waikoloa Dry Forest Initiative.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1569205932/ag2bzkkcdbne6qamqqv6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>This ancient wiliwili tree survived the feral goats' voracious appetites.</i></p>
<h3>
<strong>Why is this project important?</strong>   </h3>
<p>The Waikoloa Dry Forest Initiative stewards a 275-acre forest preserve that encompasses some of the last remaining dryland forest in South Kohala. While only about 10 percent or less of this native ecosystem still exists in Hawai'i, important species, including the endangered wiliwili trees, are still thriving under the care of the land managers in Waikoloa. Their work focuses on restoring the area with trees, shrubs and grasses that were once abundant in the region and raising awareness about this special ecosystem.</p>
<p> In ancient times, forests thrived just fine without human help. Because this fragile environment has endured hundreds of years of impact by humans, this forest needs our help to become a richly diverse ecosystem once again. It takes expert management and a dedicated community to restore a forest.</p>
<p>For The Eternal Wiliwili Forest project, I'll create a series of prints that tell a story of the evolution of The Waikoloa Dry Forest at this moment in time.  The forest itself, and this body of art and storytelling is a legacy for future generations</p>
<h3><strong>My Background</strong></h3>
<p>I am a professional artist, specializing in printmaking. Over the past 18 years my work has focused on the native species of Hawai'i.  Because my educational background is in archaeology,  I bring an awareness of the cultural and historical significance of the endangered ecosystems of Hawaii to my art. I am passionate about creating beautiful and evocative images that inspire people to care about these special plants and ecosystems that are so important to the environmental and cultural well-being of Hawai'i.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1569270215/laalqvadefxiqy1eogow.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I planted my first tree at the Waikoloa Dry Forest six years ago and fell in love with this place. This led to a series of six woodcut prints featuring the ecosystem of the forest, including two botanical portraits. The Executive Director of the forest, botanist Jen Lawson, supported my efforts with information so that I could merge the worlds of art and botany with accuracy.  I then coordinated a group exhibition and fundraiser for the WDFI.</p>
<p>My art is exhibited in several of Hawaii's premier galleries on Maui and the Big Island. Learn more about me and enjoy my art on my website at <a href=""https://andreapro.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">andreapro.com.</a></p>
<h3><strong>My process in creating a series of prints</strong></h3>
<p>First, I gather knowledge and impressions by volunteering on forest work days and participating in community tours. We gather seeds, plant trees and shrubs and transplant in the nursery. I listen and learn from forest managers as they share about the plants and forest.  I roam around sketching and photographing plants, and occasionally hug the ancient wiliwili trees that dot the landscape. This project will involve many visits to the forest and conversations with the forest managers and other experts, like ornithologists and entomologists, in my quest to understand the essence of the plants and dry forest ecosystem.</p>
<p>Next, I incubate all of my impressions and finally start to compose themes for each work of art and sketch the compositions.  From there I transfer the image to the blocks and begin carving and printing. My prints are produced in limited editions, usually 20 - 30 original prints for each image.  For this project I anticipate beginning the sketching and carving in early November, with all prints completed by the end of March 2020.</p>
<h3><strong>How Your Contribution will be Used</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1. Funding the art project and community exhibition.  </strong></p>
<p>The expenses for this project include paper at $1,800, framing at $3,000, tools and ink at $200, for a total of $5,000.  I plan to produce limited editions of 20 - 30 prints for each image. I'll need to purchase special custom-cut Japanese woodblocks, archival paper, inks and other tools. Framing the prints for the exhibition  will be the biggest expense. Printmaking is a time consuming medium. Each print requires carving multiple blocks and printing each block on each sheet of paper on my press in my studio.  Your contribution will also support me during the months of time and effort it will take to create this project. In return you'll receive art that is priced below retail level. Once the project is complete prices will increase to market value.</p>
<p><strong>2.  Funds for the Waikoloa Dry Forest Initiative.</strong></p>
<p>The Waikoloa Dry Forest Initiative will receive 20% of all funds contributed and will apply the funds to their native tree planing program. Learn more about WDFI at <strong><a href=""https://waikoloadryforest.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">waikoloadryforest.org</a></strong></p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal of $15,000.00, the funds I do receive will be used to cover these project expenses first.  That way I can still complete the series and we can have the exhibition. The exhibition alone will benefit the Waikoloa Dry Forest Initiative through community involvement.</p>
<p>20% of funds will be donated to WDFI after the contributions cover project expenses. In addition I'll give WDFI the licensing rights to two images to use for a mural and for tee shirts or other products.</p>
<p><strong>Questions?   </strong></p>
<p><strong>Feel free to reach out to me or  Jen Lawson, Executive Director of the forest. </strong>Go to <strong><a href=""https://waikoloadryforest.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">waikoloadryforest.org</a></strong> and click contact link at bottom of the page.                              <strong>                                                                                                                                            </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Why do a Fundraiser?</strong></h3>
<p>To create a forest, we need to rally together!  In addition to offering financial support for this project and to the forest, this campaign will generate events and more community connections that bring people to the forest. People who experience the forest support the forest.</p>
<p>The Waikoloa Dry Forest has thrived because of the energy of a large and diverse community of invested participants.  This project, with it's focus on celebrating and documenting the forest through art and storytelling, will reach even more people who will want to be involved. As a contributor, you'll be part of the community and history of the Waikoloa Dry Forest.</p>

<h3><strong>About Your Perks</strong></h3>
<p>The perks I'm offering fall in two categories:  greeting cards and botanical pillows that are commercially printed from my art designs and original art that will be produced over the next six months. You'll be able to see the cards here and the pillow choices on my website.</p>
<p> I realize that when you choose original art as your perk, you are choosing art sight unseen. That takes trust!  I encourage you to explore the art I have posted here and on my website to get a clear idea of my style and color palette.</p>
<p><strong>See my art and get to know me at <a href=""https://andreapro.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">andreapro.com</a>.  I'd love to hear from you! Contact me through this platform or my site.                                                                      </strong></p>
<p>Your additional perks:  We will let you know when Forest tours and visits to my studio are scheduled so you can join us. With great appreciation, I'll give you a Mahalo on my Facebook page to thank you for your contribution.</p>
<h3><strong>Risks and Challenges  </strong></h3>
<p>Any weighty project comes with risks and challenges, after all that is what helps us grow and learn.  I have worked on complex art projects and exhibitions both as a solo artist and in collaboration with other artists.  I'm very persistent in solving the inevitable challenges that each project presents, and I also have a highly developed sense of integrity! You can be assured that I'll give this project 150% of my energy and I'll keep you posted about developments along the way.</p>

The perks I'm offering fall in two categories:  greeting cards and botanical pillows that are commercially printed from my art designs and original art that will be produced over the next six months. You'll be able to see the cards here and the pillow choices on my website.
 I realize that when you choose original art as your perk, you are choosing art sight unseen. That takes trust!  I encourage you to explore the art I have posted here and on my website to get a clear idea of my style and color palette.
See my art and get to know me at andreapro.com.  I'd love to hear from you! Contact me through this platform or my site.                                                                      
Your additional perks:  We will let you know when Forest tours and visits to my studio are scheduled so you can join us. With great appreciation, I'll give you a Mahalo on my Facebook page to thank you for your contribution.
Risks and Challenges  
Any weighty project comes with risks and challenges, after all that is what helps us grow and learn.  I have worked on complex art projects and exhibitions both as a solo artist and in collaboration with other artists.  I'm very persistent in solving the inevitable challenges that each project presents, and I also have a highly developed sense of integrity! You can be assured that I'll give this project 150% of my energy and I'll keep you posted about developments along the way.

<h3><strong>THE MISSION: SEND DENISE TO VEGAS</strong></h3>
<p>In 2016, Denise won “Best-in-Show” in the Las Vegas International Juried Art Competition at Jana’s RedRoom Gallery, located in Las Vegas, Nevada. The winning artwork, “The Jacks of Jupiter”was a 40 x 26 work-on-paper from her House of Cards Series, which reimagines in 56 large-scale works-on-paper -- clubs become trees, spades reference bones and fossils, diamonds transform in to constellations and celestial bodies, and hearts draw inspiration from Egyptian Tomb paintings and the Tarot.</p>

<h3>Denise Levertov Plaque</h3>
<p>Denise Levertov is one of the most accomplished poets ever to call Seattle home. She lived here for the last 8 years of her life and also was on the faculty of one of the Cascadia bioregion's most legendary poetry events, the 1963 Vancouver Poetry Conference. A huge body of work, poetry AND essays, some of which on poetics have been critical to post-WWII North American poetry, her correspondence with poets like William Carlos Williams and Robert Duncan, her brilliant teaching at Stanford and other institutions and her fierce anti-war stance are all part of why she deserves this recognition nearly 20 years after her death. Her poems about Mt. Rainier may be the best ever done of The Mountain, as we say here in Seattle.

<h3>Martrys of Humboldt 7</h3>
<p>In 1998, an international team of artists (Janet Pavone, Daniel Hopewell &amp; Cecilia Herrero) traveled to Havana by invitation from a Cuban conservation group of architects and planners to paint a mural about the history of the neighborhood inside the 'Martrys of Humboldt 7' public school.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550411978/lmeu8uckpribitgkc32c.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>There is no public or private funding available for a project like this, which is why we are asking for your help.</p>
<p>We need only $5000 USD to buy equipment and paint and to secure paint, equipment and subsistence for the artists, including young muralists from Nicaragua who will travel to Cuba to help with the restoration. None of the artists will profit from this project. All money raised will be used directly to restore the mural.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>The Cuban people have been under an economic blockade for over 50 years and the difficulties this presents for the school system means there are very limited funds for projects like this. Art and culture are fundamental to telling the story of the Cuban people and their revolution, and this public school finds itself at the centre of an artistic renaissance in Havana. Outside the school gates, tourists flood 'Callejon de Hamel' to see the murals, music and dancing. Inside the school, the children need to feel that the mural that celebrates their history and the area is also preserved and looked after. This is what this project is about.</p>

<p>Hello There! My name is Aaron Decker, a jeweler based in Michigan. My day job is in product development with Shinola Detroit, while I also maintain a thriving studio jewelry practice. I grew up in Maine around my grandfather who was a clocksmith, I studied jewelry as a way to connect with his memory upon his passing. He always taught me that good work requires good tools. </p>
<p>The past ten years Ive developed my practice, received degrees in metalsmithing from Cranbrook Academy of Art, and Maine College of Art, and won numerous awards. I really derive all my energy from what I learned when I was around my grandfather, a true craftsmen. </p>
<p>In this segment of my career, I have taken on several large jobs such as making bowls for the Shinola Hotel, Contributing a jewelry ling to the brand as well. Participating in several exhibitions nationally and internationally - all while having a basement studio and a hand me down kiln from the 1970's :) You make it work when you have too. </p>
<p>With this growth I am looking to expand my tools, and update them. A new Kiln for enameling, the process I am exploring in my practice, and a ventilation system to make my studio safe for me and my continued practice. Both tools are paramount for my progression and I'm excited to ask for your participation in making it happen. I hope to raise $1300 for this endeavor.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>PERKS!!!!!!!</h3>
<p>The tools im specifically looking to purchase are a larger kiln from Rio, model 1000, which runs $950, and an HAKKO Fume Extraction System that costs $795. </p>
<p>The Perks vary depending on how much you're able to donate. While everyone who donates will receive something, those who donate between $100-$300 dollars will received exceptional pieces of one of a kind jewelry and objects including Enameled Wall Dots, Enameled bowls, a beaded Enamel Necklace or pair of earrings! All funds will go to buying the new tools, and making the splendid gifts for all those who donated!</p>
<p>Achieving this goal is important in my studio practice, and the impact of it will be huge as I take on new projects in the coming years and begin to build new bodies of work, and enamel jewelry. </p>
<p>While I know not all are able to contribute I would very much appreciate you sharing this funding campaign in your social circles and to all those who are interested. I appreciate any and all contributions you are willing to give.  Please use Indiegogo share tools and your online social media platforms to share :)</p>

<p><u><strong>Introduction of Ekoin</strong></u></p>
<p>Nice to meet you!</p>
<p>We are Koya-san Shingon Sect, Jyun Bekkaku Honzan (Semi-Special Head Temple), Ekoin.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for visiting this page out of many campaigns.</p>
<p>Ekoin is a Buddhist Temple with a history of 1200 years, located in one of the world heritages, Mt. Koya, Wakayama, Japan.</p>
<p>It is called the Ekoin (回向院 in Japanese character) because the Master Kukai (a.k.a. Kobo-Daishi who is a founder of Shingon Sect) erected a five-storied pagoda in this location, and his disciple Dosho, the priest, performed Eko (回向 in Japanese), the revolving of the people (the memorial service of the ancestors) in here. </p>
<p>During Hoei period (early 1700s), Ekoin is renamed to our current name by Yoshimune Tokugawa who is 8th shogun of Tokugawa Shogunate. (The name given at that time had same sound, but different character as 恵光院 )</p>
<p>We have two halls. Main hall enshrines Amida Nyorai (Amitabha in Sanskrit), Kukai (Kobo-Daishi), and Fudo Myo (Acalanatha in Sanskrit). And the other hall called Bishamon Hall enshrines Bishamon Ten (Vaisravana in Sanskrit) as its principal images.</p>
<p>Ekoin is also known as a Shukubo (宿坊 in Japanese).</p>
<p>Shukubo is a place where you can get the taste of monk's life style with Temple Lodging. You can stay in our temple, enjoy our Shojin Ryori (Buddhist Vegetarian Cuisine) and experience activities.</p>
<p>A specialty experiences at Ekoin areÂ ""Homa Fire Ritual"" and ""Meditation"". Visitors can join the Homa Fire Ritual, performed every morning with monks. And various kinds of meditation programs are offered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Introduction of Koya-san</strong></u></p>
<p>Koya-san (Mt. Koya) is well known as a Headquarter of Shingon Sect Buddhism which is found by Master Kukai (Kobo-Daishi) back in 9th century. It is also known as a World Heritage certified in 2004. Therefore, Koya-san is not only a place for religious believers, but also an unique place for visitors &amp; travelers now. Within Koya-san, there is the Master Head Temple, Kongobuji in the middle, and many of Head and Semi Head Temples around. Each temple has its own historical episodes and heritages. Every time you visit, you must find and experience something different.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Current Situtaion in Koya-san</strong></u></p>
<p>Due to COVID-19 situation, visitors to Koya-san has dramatically decreased. The number of visitors to Ekoin now is 5% of usual. If this situation continues, we will face the difficulty to preserve this historically &amp; religiously important heritages. Your contribution will save it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Why we started this project &amp; What we want to do</strong></u></p>
<p>Under the COVID-19 situation, people all over the world are asked self-restraint (or maybe stricter in some places) to go out. Of course, going abroad is out of question now. People cannot come and pray in  Koya-san even if they wanted to. We understand this is a necessary sacrifice.</p>
<p>Under such a situation, we monks at Ekoin discussed,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What can we do for the world?</p>
<p>What can we do for Koya-san? </p>
<p>How can we help the world?</p>
<p>How can we preserve the history, culture, heritage, and people in here?</p>
<p> </p>

<p>This is our motivation to start this campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What you'll get from contribution</p>
<p>-We will pray ""World Peace"" and ""World Health"" instead of backers.</p>
<p>-Backers will receive unique return items depend on the amount of contribution. All items will be prayed by monks in Ekoin with certain traditional praying ceremony. Please check out the all perks we offer.</p>
<p>-Through your contribution, you can save not only temple itself, but people's life working for Koya-san temples such as craftsman in here, cooks in here etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Finally</p>
<p>Thank you for reading to the end.</p>
<p>Ekoin sincerely pray that the coronavirus pandemic will end as soon as possible and everyone will be able to visit Koya-san.</p>
<p>Until people come to a peaceful world without any conflicts, we monks offer prayers. So that you can relieve the suffering of living things.  Gassho (合掌)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This project will be implemented in the flexible funding. Even the total contributions are less than target amount we set, we will perform all perks to the backers.</p>

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>Hi!<br/><br/>I'm Jennifer Taylor, I'm a self-taught artist and this is my newly acquired <i>abandoned</i> house and side lot in Gary, IN.</p>
<p>It's startling and deeply sad to see so many homes around here simply collapse after being abandoned.  I can't imagine how painful it must have been for families to realize that, for a variety of reasons, they could no longer stay in their homes and the only solution was to simply walk away.</p>
<p>This is one of those houses and it's been calling to me.  I want to revive it - not only to its former self - but to a place of glory!</p>
<p>After its many years of neglect, I'm going to celebrate its existence and exterior with SPARKLES and give it purpose by turning part of it into a community artist studio for classes and artist residencies.</p>
<p>The side lot will become a sculpture garden where artists will be invited to come make sculpture and gardeners to plant flowers and vegetables.</p>
<p>My intention is simply to do something fun while also enabling this little SPARKLE HOUSE to  'spark change' in this Gary, IN community.</p>
<p>As you can see from the video, it will need quite a bit of work.  I've saved and borrowed but still could use a little help.  If you can spare a few dollars I'd be grateful.  If not, no worries but please stay tuned to the renovation progress and, when it's finished, stop by for a visit!</p>
<h3>What will the money be used for?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>$2000    Exterior House Prep and Paint</p>
<p>$   900   Special Sparkles/Glue/Sealer</p>
<p>$2000    Sculpture Garden slabs for sculpture support/mulch</p>
<p>$4500    ADA wheelchair ramp/accessible bathroom</p>
<p>$1200     Canvas/Paint/Brushes/Stools</p>
<p>$2000     Adaptable Classroom Lighting</p>
<p>$2400      Front stairs/outdoor classroom painting deck</p>
<p>$2300       Exterior Lighting</p>
<p>$2000      Four Dumpsters/Permits</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Sometimes in life we just have to do something fun!  In an area that's depressed like Gary, IN, your donation becomes part of lifting spirits and inspiring hopeful action toward change.  Your donation - large or small - is really important and also becomes part of the fun!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>It took eight months to persuade the city of Gary to finally allow me to purchase this house. I know it won't be an easy project but I'm super-excited and determined to see it thru! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I completely understand if you aren't able to donate at this time but it would be equally helpful if you could share this Indiegogo Campaign with your friends.</p>

<h3>About My Practice and the Dream House Trailer Project</h3>
<p>I am an artist living and working in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I have an interdisciplinary approach to my practice in both materials and presentation, which provides an overall structure to my work, as does my personal narrative in/out of social context; the materiality of objects; repetition and scale; and space/place. I have mounted several installation works over the last ten years. (Secretly), I also have a career as a luchador wrestler, which counts as performance experience (even though it was all totally real!). I am currently working on my thesis in the MFA Art Practice program at the School of Visual Arts in New York City and will graduate in Summer 2019. I received a BFA in Graphic Design from the University of Tulsa.</p>
<p>To view examples of my work, visit my Instagram: <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/nic_finley/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">@nic_finley</a></p>
<p>""The Dream House Trailer Experience"" is near and dear to my heart, as it is semi-autobiographical. I grew up in a trailer park and have both fond feelings of living there and the feelings my parents experienced - embarrassment, not achieving the American Dream and the stigma of being labeled ""Trailer Trash."" The Dream House Trailer gives a glimpse into trailer life, but also turns the story around on the 1% and Barbie falling on hard times - with a lot of humor, of course. This year, Satellite Art Show artists will exhibit in individual storage containers, so the venue is perfect to depict a trailer. Because this is a new work, I have no images, but I can tell you that the container will become a trailer and I will become Trailer Park Barbie! </p>
<p>Exhibiting at the Satellite Art Show will be the biggest show of my art career to date, while also providing invaluable experience and a very large audience to view my work. Your support will be part of an important phase in my art practice and will give me the encouragement to continue experimenting with work like the Dream House Trailer. Thank you in advance for teaming up with me to make this happen!</p>

<h3>The Breakdown...and Donor Perks!</h3>
<p>""The Dream House Trailer Experience"" is a new work and will premiere at the Satellite Art Show! With that, all costs related to materials, design and set-up will be incurred to make this happen. Here is a breakdown of expenses:</p>

<p>With as little as $5,000 I could print and frame a number of large works along with multiple smaller pieces, and I would be able to show them in a gallery setting. These prints would be made on the best printers available, with archival inks on fine art paper. The matted prints will, finally, be framed under plexiglass. They will be museum quality works. I have been busy creating new works, everyday, on the computer - I just need to turn them into real Objects of Art. With these new works in hand I could approach galleries and gain representation, as well as participate in group shows across the country. </p>
<p>My work is very unique, and the larger size will really make them stand out as powerful visual statements. The colors will be so vibrant that these prints will almost seem to reach out and grab the viewer! It would make for a very exciting exhibition.</p>
<p>Any money I receive will be used to create the prints. A single print will cost $125, plus shipping. To mat and frame a print this size will cost around $200. I will do as much of the assembly of the framing as possible. I am thoroughly dedicated to doing this.</p>

<h3>WHO ARE WE? ​</h3>
<p>East Street Arts are a creative social enterprise and registered charity based in Leeds, UK. We create space for making art, social events and learning opportunities to make our cities better places to live and work.</p>
<p>Our work can be seen on buildings, the high street and in neighbourhoods. We are here to support artists as we believe they have the talent, energy, ideas and determination to change our worlds.<br/> </p>
<h3>A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT</h3>
<p>We have always dreamed of having our very own hostel. Inspired by the accommodation we’ve encountered on our travels, we saw a real opportunity to open something similar in Leeds. We wanted to provide affordable accommodation which was designed, created and run by artists, for curious travellers.</p>
<p><strong>And we did it!</strong></p>
<p>In 2016, we opened a temporary pop-up Art Hostel on Kirkgate in Leeds. The first social enterprise of its kind in the UK, the hostel provided a portal directly into the underbelly of the city’s creative and independent scene.</p>
<p><strong>And it was great!</strong></p>
<p>10,170 guests from 117 countries, eight unique rooms, 18,282 cups of tea, 424 litres of paint later...we found out that we had to close the temporary hostel earlier than we'd planned after we lost the building we were leasing.</p>
<p><strong>We were gutted!</strong></p>
<p>But, we’d proven that the Art Hostel could be everything we’d dreamed of (and more)! And we just couldn’t let it all end there…<br/> </p>
<h3>WHY DO WE NEED YOUR HELP?</h3>
<p>So, we found the perfect building for a permanent Art Hostel and made the decision to take out a loan to secure it. A risky but essential move.</p>
<p>But a building does not an Art Hostel make.</p>
<p><strong>We now need to inject the art...and we need your help to do it!</strong></p>
<p>It is the art that makes the Art Hostel so very special. Its vibrant and varied rooms provide the exciting and unique experience that our guests have come to know and love.</p>
<p>We desperately need to raise the funds to commission artists who will transform the space. Without your help, we simply won’t be able to do it!</p>
<p>The Art Hostel isn't just a place to stay. It's a home for volunteers from around the world, a place to make and show work, call in for a Tuesday tea or take part in Pay-As-You-Feel yoga. It's a place for you. <strong>Which is why we need your support!</strong><br/> </p>
<h3>WHERE WILL YOUR MONEY GO?</h3>
<p>All of the money raised will go straight to paying artists and funding materials to create a selection of fantastic Art Hostel rooms and communal spaces.<br/> </p>
<h3>HOW MUCH DO WE NEED TO RAISE?</h3>
<p>A grand total of £15,000 </p>
<p>(Don't worry if the currency appears as USD, the campaign is in GBP. You can change the currency you view the campaign in on the bottom left corner of your page.)<br/> </p>
<h3>WHAT’S IN IT FOR YOU?</h3>
<p>Obviously, you’ll get the warm glow of being a generous human being, but we also have a selection of awesome rewards available to give you another little incentive too.<br/> </p>
<h3>WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO NEXT?</h3>
<p>Make your pledge!</p>
<p>All of the money you give will go towards paying artists and providing materials to transform the hostel rooms.</p>
<p>We know that not everyone is in a position to donate, so please help us by spreading the word.<br/> </p>
<h3>WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED TO KNOW?</h3>
<p>The Art Hostel is a social enterprise run by registered charity, East Street Arts, so helping the project immediately proves that you’re ultimately a very good person. Expect good karma! You’ll allow something truly special to be created within, and for Leeds, and those who visit the city.</p>

So, we found the perfect building for a permanent Art Hostel and made the decision to take out a loan to secure it. A risky but essential move.
But a building does not an Art Hostel make.
We now need to inject the art...and we need your help to do it!
It is the art that makes the Art Hostel so very special. Its vibrant and varied rooms provide the exciting and unique experience that our guests have come to know and love.
We desperately need to raise the funds to commission artists who will transform the space. Without your help, we simply won’t be able to do it!
The Art Hostel isn't just a place to stay. It's a home for volunteers from around the world, a place to make and show work, call in for a Tuesday tea or take part in Pay-As-You-Feel yoga. It's a place for you. Which is why we need your support! 
WHERE WILL YOUR MONEY GO?
All of the money raised will go straight to paying artists and funding materials to create a selection of fantastic Art Hostel rooms and communal spaces. 
HOW MUCH DO WE NEED TO RAISE?
A grand total of £15,000 
(Don't worry if the currency appears as USD, the campaign is in GBP. You can change the currency you view the campaign in on the bottom left corner of your page.) 
WHAT’S IN IT FOR YOU?
Obviously, you’ll get the warm glow of being a generous human being, but we also have a selection of awesome rewards available to give you another little incentive too. 
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO NEXT?
Make your pledge!
All of the money you give will go towards paying artists and providing materials to transform the hostel rooms.
We know that not everyone is in a position to donate, so please help us by spreading the word. 
WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED TO KNOW?
The Art Hostel is a social enterprise run by registered charity, East Street Arts, so helping the project immediately proves that you’re ultimately a very good person. Expect good karma! You’ll allow something truly special to be created within, and for Leeds, and those who visit the city.

<p><strong>Who we are</strong></p>
<p>Hello! We are a very diverse team of  Russians. Some of us work at a cinema, other fight forest fires. There are street artists and engineers; some even don’t bother working at all and live in a ceiling cabinet… What brings us together is our shared perception of the world, which has inspired us to create our artwork - Zarya.</p>
<p>We set big goals, some of them exceeding the length of human life. Perhaps that’s why our project was among the 70 winners of the Black Rock Honoraria Program this year. Their grant has helped us a lot and we built our carousel in Russia. Now it’s time to move on together so we will be grateful for your support!</p>
<p><strong>What we do</strong></p>
<p>Zarya (Aurora) - is a manually driven carousel, breathing out fire and smoke. The energy of the human motor magically transforms into creativity and joy overwhelming the people on the platform, making them feel sincere, free and light-hearted, travelling them back into the happy days of childhood.</p>
<p>The carousel looks rough and cinematic; it is covered by rust and stains, it is embroidered by charred woodwork and charming crack patterns. But all these do not frighten but cast a magic spell!</p>
<p>And when Zarya is set in motion and light and sounds are on – everything around fills up with irresistible vital energy, drive and euphoria. You can’t stop it unless you stop the spinning. But you actually don’t need this, as the platform moves at a reasonable speed and it is easy to keep the balance for the easy riders. Driving the carousel takes quite light physical inputs. When twisted, the installation flashes in clouds of smoke and shoots fire into the sky.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561433926/bcy2qdtgowntadrosnjh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Why we need your money</strong></p>
<p>We have assembled the carousel and it’s already travelling across the Atlantics on a ship, packed together with its charming beasts. They are sleeping calmly in the 27-feet container and we envy them as we can not afford this privilege until we find the remaining $12500 to make it all happen.</p>
<p>Two-way ticket to the blues</p>
<p>Bringing Zarya to Playa with the following withdrawal from Black Rock City costs $10000. We have already paid the first increment – $2000 for the naval freight - and $8000 is due. We can’t burn this object as there’s nothing to burn (mainly metal parts), nor can we abandon or sell it, as this is the only happy place in the word as we know it.</p>
<p>Gimme fuel, gimme fire, gimme that which I desire!</p>
<p>Our kid is quite insatiable. It drinks gasoline and breathes propane, so we will need 110 gallons of gas and 70 gallons of propane along with storage tanks. Also, Zarya can’t get by without electricity, which helps it glow, sound and emit smokes. The food for the carousel would cost $1500.</p>
<p>Smoke on the rotor...</p>
<p>Zarya boasts quite a post-apocalyptic appearance. Covered with smoke puffs, it looks like a celestial castle. Or, living by its name, a sundawn. Three smoke machines working together will make our carousel  stand on the soil of Playa and float in the sky above at the same time. Just try to imagine this!  Liquid smoke would take further $600.</p>
<p>...And fire in the sky</p>
<p>There is a 22-foot mast on the carousel. It spits out fire 6 feet above, making the fire tongue of Zarya. We will need to ensure its absolute safety for the Burning Man people. Hoses, valves, controllers, fire extinguishers and the like would  cost $1200.</p>
<p>So rock me mama like a wagon wheel</p>
<p>The carousel will need extra heavy-duty wheels. Concealed under the skirt of the carousel, these move it along the circle rail. These wheels are actually the whales carrying the world around the carousel. You do know what the sand of Playa is like, don't you? So for Zarya to survive the Burning Man, it would require spare wheels, at least six of them. Another $800.</p>
<p>Shine on you crazy diamond                        </p>
<p>Zarya consists of two principal parts. The carousel itself and the actuator assembly with the manual driving handle. So far, there has been an incredibly marvellous illumination of the main part of the caroussel, while the other section is bare. It should be lit with neon and lamps for eye appeal and safety. In our humble count it must be 400$.</p>
<p><strong>What our project may bring to you</strong></p>
<p>Join us in having fun around Zarya. Anyone is free to twist it.</p>
<p>In fact, Zarya can become what you want it to be. Musicians will be happy playing on a circle-shaped rotating stage with the sound of music reaching out all around. Dance lovers will catch their moment of glory on a steampunk-style dancing pylon. Kids will get just crazy riding the charming wooden beasts. Actors, poets, standup comedians will hijack ovations in the smoke and fire scenery. The overall euphoria in the surroundings will be spiced by the genuine lamp funk of the 60s and 70s, together with joy, drive and hugs.</p>
<p>Please, join us at the Burning Man 2019. Let's twist the carousel together!</p>

<p><strong>Key concept</strong></p>
<p>The main underlying idea of the project is post-apocalyptic utopia. The idea of a happy future. Zarya is the Russian name for aurora, or sun dawn. This is the beginning of a new chapter of life.The carousel represents a magic land which has somehow survived a global disaster.

There is no difference between givers and takers, between those who twist the carousel and those who ride it. They exist together as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>Risks. Our plan in case we fail to raise the necessary amount</strong></p>
<p>Dear friends. Most of us have never visited the Burning Man. So everything that is to happen will be just cool. We do have some experience in travel, expeditions and festivals, but this is going to be our first time of bringing our art to the Burning Man. We bet you know what we mean….))</p>
<p>If we dont raise the needed sum, we will just take our favorite perks - bottles, glasses, and a corkscrew - and will make our favorite The First Timer cocktail.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>When we learned about Zarya winning a grant from the BLACK ROCK HONORARIA PROGRAM we were very happy to gain recognition from the world's most renowned festival.

<h3>Bringing to light the Art of Symeon Shimin</h3>
<p>Born in Astrakhan, Russia, on the Caspian Sea, Symeon Shimin (1902-1984) immigrated at the age of 10 with his Jewish family to the United States, settling in Brooklyn, New York. He started drawing two years later and never stopped. Over a prolific career, he created numerous canvases, illustrated over 50 children’s books, created the original <i>Gone with the Wind</i> movie poster, and painted the epic 40-foot-long canvas for the promotion of King Vidor’s <i>Solomon and Sheba</i>.</p>
<p>One of his most acclaimed achievements was the mural <i>Contemporary Justice and The Child</i>, awarded by the Public Works Arts Project for the Department of Justice Building in Washington, DC, where it stands today. Sir John Rothenstein, director of the Tate Gallery in London from 1938 to 1964, said of this mural, “Ardent feeling is given expression in a large and noble design.”</p>
<p><i>The Art of Symeon Shimin</i> presents for the first time a meaningful perspective of this unique artist whose deep involvement in a quest for justice and human rights was paramount to the way he lived and painted. It includes over 100 plates and photographs, with essays by Josef Woodard and Charles Donelan, as well as an autobiography by the artist. </p>
<p>The artist's daughter, Tonia Shimin, is a dance faculty emerita at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where she taught for 27 years. She lovingly curated the first-ever total collection of all known Shimin paintings and artworks over many years, joining the personal family collection with images of paintings in private, museum and gallery collections. Only this year she discovered the gigantic painting for the film <i>Solomon and Sheba</i> that was exhibited at The Detour Gallery, in Red Bank, New Jersey where it had been stored for many years.</p>
<p>Symeon Shimin was a vessel for the unheard voices of his time. Those who were shunned, he highlighted; for those who were unseen, he provided a stage. He saw the common man for what he was – beautiful, exceptional, and equal. As a Jewish immigrant whose family fled the Pogroms for Brooklyn, as well as a child laborer himself, he understood that viewpoint personally. </p>

We are seeking additional funds to now develop video presentations to enhance the overall training. The videos will utilize roll players to demonstrate the techniques taught in a visual learning experience. We are also seeking our initial customer base  who can then provide feedback on the training program itself. All donors will receive full and continuous access to the total training program to include all written lessons, all 8 audio presentations, practical exercises, and online discussion boards.

/Help us fund issue 15. of ARTIC magazine! Theme: faul=lazy,foul/





20 Jahre A R T I C Magazin:

ARTIC. Texte aus der fröhlichen Wissenschaft  Zeitschrift für Kunst und Philosophie vor mehr als 20 Jahren gegründet. Jedes Heft widmet sich einem Thema, das durch das jeweilige Titel-Stichwort repräsentiert wird. Jedes Heft ist ein Konzert unterschiedlichster Text- und Gestaltungsgattungen, begonnen beim materialbasierten Einband, getragen durch ein das Stichwort interpretierendes Layout der Lyrik-, Essay- oder Prosabeiträge (es gibt kein Masterlayout!) bis hin zu den Multiples, die  als Originale ins fertige Heft eingearbeitet werden. 
Artic magazine has a 20 year history. It is published in German with occasional texts in English.  The magazine is part hand made. Each copy includes original work/multiples.  Artic has recently been showcased in a major museum show (http://www.wkv-stuttgart.de/de/programm/2014/querungen/artic/)

</div><div>It pretty much sums up the feel and inspiration behind what I've been creating lately. I wanted to take the impressions and images trapped in my head, capture them and allow wider audience to see the beautiful repetition and great feeling of freedom you can experience as a part of urban landscape with it's verticality, mass and scale. Seeing metropolis as the ultimate form of human achievement and celebration thereof is what Londonscape conveys to its audience. </div><div>Paperchase is a natural extension of Londonscape as one can find the same form of pattern and structure in this very different environment. Take a piece of paper, fold it , colour it , place it in front of light; the resemblance to microcosm of urban landscape is uncanny. However, working with paper allows a different more hands-on approach where instead of finding the right image and point of view, one can create it. </div><div><b>Supplies and print </b></div><div>The next step is putting the imagery (please have a look below ) into print. </div><div>This is where your support will be key ! Fabrics and print on large scale cost many pennies and I'd be grateful for every single one that will bring me closer to accomplishing what I set off to do when I started. </div><div>I would like to print the images onto silk and create sample scarves and pocket squares. <br/>

Some time ago I've remembered this video I used to see on MTV years ago. 
It pretty much sums up the feel and inspiration behind what I've been creating lately. I wanted to take the impressions and images trapped in my head, capture them and allow wider audience to see the beautiful repetition and great feeling of freedom you can experience as a part of urban landscape with it's verticality, mass and scale. Seeing metropolis as the ultimate form of human achievement and celebration thereof is what Londonscape conveys to its audience. Paperchase is a natural extension of Londonscape as one can find the same form of pattern and structure in this very different environment. Take a piece of paper, fold it , colour it , place it in front of light; the resemblance to microcosm of urban landscape is uncanny. However, working with paper allows a different more hands-on approach where instead of finding the right image and point of view, one can create it. Supplies and print The next step is putting the imagery (please have a look below ) into print. This is where your support will be key ! Fabrics and print on large scale cost many pennies and I'd be grateful for every single one that will bring me closer to accomplishing what I set off to do when I started. I would like to print the images onto silk and create sample scarves and pocket squares. 
As well as having these printed as accessories I'd like them printed on the biggest format canvas my pocket could afford to really add impact. Final prints will be used for exhibitions. Breakdown of costs : Printing on canvas (Giclée) - app £400-600  (per canvas)Printing on Giclée paper - app  £400-600  (per sheet)Printing on silk (scarf ) - £54/£99  ( per scarf) Printing on silk (pocket square ) - £30 (per item) The Images Pocket Square - Visualisation of styling options

Most of the pictures were created by self-taught artists with little or no formal training. I found many of these paintings in odd corners of the urban landscape during my day job as a contractor. The more I discovered, the more I sensed the importance of grouping such works together to represent the creativity and visions of these too-often overlooked members of society. More than 150 of these pieces can be viewed at <a href=""http://www.Diartspora.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.Diartspora.com</a>.</p>
<p>The condition of a number of these works, however, is poor. There are tears, rips, flaking and missing areas of paint, chips and often a build-up of grime. Some pieces need re-matting due to yellowing and warping, some need re-framing, and some have no frame at all. The attention of a professional art conservator can bring these wonderful images back to their original, powerful expression.</p>
<p>With restoration, the entire collection could then be in a position to be exhibited to the public at large. We have already received requests as to where one might view it. The funds provided by generous donors can help make that happen, and be instrumental in the future establishment of a unique cultural institution, exhibiting art by, for, and of the people.</p>
<p>We estimate that $25,000.00 would be needed to accomplish the following goals:</p>
<p><b>Repair</b>, restore, touch-up and clean at least 15 paintings </p>
<p><b>Re-matte,</b> re-frame and provide new frames for approximately 20 pieces.</p>
<p><b>Properly package</b> and safely store the works in a climate controlled storage facility until such time that a permanent location can be acquired.  </p><p><b>Photograph</b> another 50 to 60 artworks - drawings,photographs and sculptures  which have yet to be catalogued</p>
<p>If our campaign is successful, we estimate the above could be accomplished in 6 to 8 months.</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Gifts will be mailed out by September 30, 2015</span></p>
<p>If we don’t reach our entire goal, we would first forego the storage and its cost, and then the framing. We would exercise artistic triage, of sorts; restoring the paintings with the worst damage first and working our towards those with lesser issues.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we envision a place where people can go and see respectful depictions and renderings of people of color, assembled in a visual narrative which showcases the rich and diverse offerings of that community. Museums in Western countries are filled with images that reflect their native populations; with people of color often shown in positions of primitivism or servitude. The Diartspora Gallery is one place where the artwork of that underserved community can be viewed online. The contributions to our campaign will go a long way towards the day when the art can be viewed in all its colorful, dramatic power in the material world.</p>
<p>We had an exhibit of 35 pieces focussing on portraiture last February ( 2014) at the University City Arts  League in Philadelphia during Black History Month. The website currently has over 2500 Twitter followers. We have had other requests for exhibits. We feel like this collection has been accumulating and gestating for 20 years; its launch into the world feels just around the corner.</p>
<p>A lack of funding would delay such a launching indefinitely. The art deserves the facelift it needs to insure its impact on the viewer. Without professional help, it runs the risk of suffering amateurish attempts at repair, as well as perhaps never meriting public exhibition.</p>

The symposium is dedicated to exploring the connection between drawing and Performance
Art and the relevance of drawing as a modern medium. The symposium presents a
refined collection of international Drawing Performance artists and includes
live drawing performances, discussion panels, artists’ talks and lectures of
art historians. The goal of the symposium is to promote the growing

allow it to rise from the eclectic, wider definition of performance art.</span></p>
<p>The first symposium was produced with no external

hours of work that were dedicated to this project. It became possible due to
the enthusiasm and faith of the participating artists who came from all over
the world, drawing from their own expenses, and by the generosity of Performance
Space and Arbeit Gallery, London, who hosted this event. </p>

collection of local and international artists keen to participate, however this
time we have to pay a fee for hiring our space. We would also like to

<p>Any fund collected in this campaign would be dedicated to the venue

and advertising activities that would allow this event to become even more
successful and attractive.</p>
<p>We cannot do it without

I was born and raised in Grand Marais, MN and I love it there, though I currently live in Southern California near Los Angeles. For the last six years I've been living back and forth between the north woods of Minnesota and sunny SoCal. My most recent move was in April 2013 and I expected to live here for no longer than a year - long enough to help my Midwest-born boyfriend Jordan save money and pack up for a move back to MN so we could begin our lives together up north where we belong.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1229458/files/20150217154311-danaandjordan.jpg?1424216591"" src="""" style=""width: 287.675555555556px; height: 383px;""/></p><p>Unfortunately I did not fully understand how expensive living in Southern California is compared to my humble homeland, and I've been stuck here since. You can read my whole story in my first blog post here: <a href=""http://backtothenorthwoods.blogspot.com/2014/11/the-beginning_9.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://backtothenorthwoods.blogspot.com/2014/11...</a></p><p>With recent news, a sense of urgency has taken over. My mom has been diagnosed with stage four (IV-B) lung cancer. I need to get back to Minnesota as soon as possible to be with her and my dad to help them through this. I'm worried and scared and not ready for the road ahead, but I'm determined to help however I can.</p><p>The money raised from this campaign will go toward my travel and moving expenses, finding a place to live in MN, and possibly a down payment on a used car (the one I was driving back home is a year younger than I am, and it's rusted out so bad I'm worried it may not be safe to drive). All the rest of the money will go straight to my folks to help them not only cover their bills, but let my mom  have some much deserved fun the next few years. Thankfully insurance is covering most of the medical side.</p><p>My parents are some of the most generous, kind, caring people you could ever meet and have gone out of their way to help people all their lives, but times have been hard lately. My dad is still working when he should be enjoying retirement. It breaks my heart to see them struggling and I want to do whatever I can to make sure they're taken care of because they've cared and helped me so much throughout my life. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1221939/files/20150214151709-donationrewards.jpg?1423955829"" src="""" style=""width: 462.091603053435px; height: 114px;""/></p><p>I find it difficult to accept money for nothing, so instead of setting up an Indiegogo Life campaign I opted for a regular one so I could include perks. My personal goal is to one day be able to make a living off of creative pursuits (writing and art), but I don't yet have a strong portfolio with examples of what I'm capable of. Through this campaign, you can help me build this portfolio and make my dream come true.</p><p><b>All rewards will be negotiated and delivered via email.</b> Feel free to contact me personally if you have any questions - aurorawolf@gmail.com</p><p>My first creative pursuit when I move back is to write a book.

Thank you all so much for your donations! This will go a long way toward helping me get home and care for my family. I'm hoping to make at least 50% of my goal by the end of this thing. One week left! Please keep spreading the word! Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about perks - I'm happy to give what I can in return!~~~~~Hello! My name is Dana. I was born and raised in Grand Marais, MN and I love it there, though I currently live in Southern California near Los Angeles. For the last six years I've been living back and forth between the north woods of Minnesota and sunny SoCal. My most recent move was in April 2013 and I expected to live here for no longer than a year - long enough to help my Midwest-born boyfriend Jordan save money and pack up for a move back to MN so we could begin our lives together up north where we belong.Unfortunately I did not fully understand how expensive living in Southern California is compared to my humble homeland, and I've been stuck here since. You can read my whole story in my first blog post here: http://backtothenorthwoods.blogspot.com/2014/11...With recent news, a sense of urgency has taken over. My mom has been diagnosed with stage four (IV-B) lung cancer. I need to get back to Minnesota as soon as possible to be with her and my dad to help them through this. I'm worried and scared and not ready for the road ahead, but I'm determined to help however I can.The money raised from this campaign will go toward my travel and moving expenses, finding a place to live in MN, and possibly a down payment on a used car (the one I was driving back home is a year younger than I am, and it's rusted out so bad I'm worried it may not be safe to drive). All the rest of the money will go straight to my folks to help them not only cover their bills, but let my mom  have some much deserved fun the next few years. Thankfully insurance is covering most of the medical side.My parents are some of the most generous, kind, caring people you could ever meet and have gone out of their way to help people all their lives, but times have been hard lately. My dad is still working when he should be enjoying retirement. It breaks my heart to see them struggling and I want to do whatever I can to make sure they're taken care of because they've cared and helped me so much throughout my life. I find it difficult to accept money for nothing, so instead of setting up an Indiegogo Life campaign I opted for a regular one so I could include perks. My personal goal is to one day be able to make a living off of creative pursuits (writing and art), but I don't yet have a strong portfolio with examples of what I'm capable of. Through this campaign, you can help me build this portfolio and make my dream come true.All rewards will be negotiated and delivered via email. Feel free to contact me personally if you have any questions - aurorawolf@gmail.comMy first creative pursuit when I move back is to write a book. I intend to write a memoire about what it's been like living two lives between the northern country and a southern city over the last few years. If it's well received I will look into publishing later.Everyone who donates at least $5 to this crowdfunding campaign will receive a digital copy of the book, no matter which perk level you choose. For example, if you sign up for a large custom art piece,  you will receive the book in addition to the art piece.Art perks may take me a year or two to deliver on. I want each piece I do to be my best ever. The book is my first priority, but I plan to complete at least one art piece a month, if not more. The ""January 2017"" date is arbitrary - I hope to have most done long before then.EDIT: Today (03/27) I added a $20 perk for custom digital sketches as a more affordable art option for anyone who might be interested!You choose the animal species and whether you want the drawing to be realistic or whimsical. If you'd like a pet portrait I will need you to email me some really good photos of your pet.Realistic = Animals as true to life as I can draw themWhimsical = Fantasy creatures, animals showing human emotion or ability, cartoony style, anthropomorphic animals and character portraits. And here are two OLD examples (10+ years old!) from when I was in high school that some of you may recognize.

<div>""My Main Goal in Art is to find the beauty: beauty lives all around us, we just have to feel it and take it"". Hi ! My name is Isabel Garmon and <b>welcome to my travel to The Florence Academy of Art: </b>Bealive me when I say that I feel passion for painting and drawing. Since three years someone very special in my life woke up this feeling inside me. Sometimes people tell me that I am an old soul because I love all themes related with ancient history: painting, sculpture, arquitecture... I think we can find magic in every place we are. I am working everyday inside of artistic projects because art is part of me and because I feel the need of improving my skills. Nowadays I am living and working in Madrid. It is a good city with very nice people living here, but I have to travel to Florence. A big impulse is growing inside me for two years to go to this italian city and live close the artistic crew that is there. And to enroll in The Florence Academy of Art is the place to start this journey. Because I want to be a great painter and this is the best place to be: Florence and this Academy !</div>

<div>Like I have said before in the video, <b>I won a scholarship from The Florence Academy of Art to attend a figure painting workshop in the month of july of the past year  </b>(and i felt in love with it...). Some time ago I heard people talk about FAA and the incredible discipline that students have there to learn exactly how to draw and face the long way of creating a good painting. All those things that an artist has to know to resolve an scene and produce good art! My life goes hand in hand with drawing and painting. I love them! And I try to move always with passion for every project. It is for that I have to enroll in FAA and know exactly the process for painting. <i>The Florence Academy of Art wrote me a Letter of Acceptance,</i> so this academy accept me as student. I just have to get the enough amount of money to enroll: this is my big dream and I would like to make it a reality with your help. This Academy trains very hard to their students and teach inside of the classical method of painting because it wants the best quality for them: it is the only way if someone wants to be a good painter. FAA is one of the best academies around the world: <a href=""http://florenceacademyofart.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://florenceacademyofart.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://florenceacademyofart.com/</a> This is one of the paintings I was working in Florence the past year in the workshop:</div>

</div></div>","""My Main Goal in Art is to find the beauty: beauty lives all around us, we just have to feel it and take it"". Hi ! My name is Isabel Garmon and welcome to my travel to The Florence Academy of Art: Bealive me when I say that I feel passion for painting and drawing. Since three years someone very special in my life woke up this feeling inside me. Sometimes people tell me that I am an old soul because I love all themes related with ancient history: painting, sculpture, arquitecture... I think we can find magic in every place we are. I am working everyday inside of artistic projects because art is part of me and because I feel the need of improving my skills. Nowadays I am living and working in Madrid. It is a good city with very nice people living here, but I have to travel to Florence. A big impulse is growing inside me for two years to go to this italian city and live close the artistic crew that is there. And to enroll in The Florence Academy of Art is the place to start this journey. Because I want to be a great painter and this is the best place to be: Florence and this Academy !

 I would like to show you part of my work, as an academic artist and illustrator:












Like I have said before in the video, I won a scholarship from The Florence Academy of Art to attend a figure painting workshop in the month of july of the past year  (and i felt in love with it...). Some time ago I heard people talk about FAA and the incredible discipline that students have there to learn exactly how to draw and face the long way of creating a good painting. All those things that an artist has to know to resolve an scene and produce good art! My life goes hand in hand with drawing and painting. I love them! And I try to move always with passion for every project. It is for that I have to enroll in FAA and know exactly the process for painting. The Florence Academy of Art wrote me a Letter of Acceptance, so this academy accept me as student. I just have to get the enough amount of money to enroll: this is my big dream and I would like to make it a reality with your help. This Academy trains very hard to their students and teach inside of the classical method of painting because it wants the best quality for them: it is the only way if someone wants to be a good painter. FAA is one of the best academies around the world: http://florenceacademyofart.com/ This is one of the paintings I was working in Florence the past year in the workshop:














- The amount of money I have to get to attend the full painting program of one year      is around $21.000 (payment are done in dollars in the Academy, but the rest of life in Florence is in euro, for that this crowdfunding works in euros) : 


Academic Year: U.S. $ 16,875.00 
Room renting and living in Florence: U.S. $ 3,700.00 
Materials and others: U.S. $ 700 

- Fees from IndieGogo (9% if I don't meet my goal, 4% if I do), Paypal (3%) and Credit Cards (3%) 

- I will have to invest time and money to make your rewards (paper, charcoal, oil painting, mediums, brushes...)- Shipping costs will be included in price of reward.
Be sure that I will be updating and keeping you informed by email to know the progress of your reward. I want you to be glad and happy with your investment!





 You choose what you want from the illustration collection or academic collection! I will send it to you as a postcard. I think it is more personal than having a ""normal copy"" :




This is a surprise reward! I will take a sketch from Prado Museum here in Madrid, and you will not know wich drawing will be until it reach your home. I use toned paper (mostly times I prepare the paper, so each one is entirely different ) for this kind of drawings because I get easily high impact with contrasts :
 I will make one portrait drawing study on charcoal for you. It will be part of a limited edition just made for this crowdfunding. It will be a surprise until it reaches your house! This sort of drawings are really beautiful when you frame them because they have a lot of expression in them:

 Limited edition of one study in oil. It will be a painting portrait on panel. Limited edition for this crowdfunding. Surprise reward too! It can be really excited not to know the result until the painting go to your hands, I think it is more private:



I will work on a painting or drawing from a photo that you choose, like a commission! You will email me a photo to work from and I am going to ask you to find the one with the best resolution and illumination. Please keep that in mind! . Working from photo is complicated so it is great if it is a good one:       - Drawing: Graphite or charcoal on paper.       - Painting: Oil on canvas.

!! For me it is very exciting to create limited editions: It is a very personal way of working in which you let me do a drawing or painting inspired on my feelings. A painter has two options of making : personal works or commissioned works. Ok... we are going to produce good work always, with good quality ! So do not worry if you choose your reward as a commission.

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Your donation directly supports the Hawaii National Slam Poetry Team in their journey to compete in Oakland this year. Over 70 teams will be facing off, from cities across the nation. Will Hawaii rank in the top five for the second year in a row? Only one way to find out . . . </h3>
<br/><br/>All donations will go toward sending our 2015 slam poetry reps - and their coach - to the national show down. If you're curious about how the funds will be distributed, these are our fundraising goals, in order of priority:<br/>
</div><div>
<ul>
<li>Airline ticket for coach<br/>
</li>
<li>Hotel rooms <br/>
</li>
<li>Per diems for each poet</li>
</ul>Although the team already has four airline tickets and one hotel room paid for by Hawaii Slam, your donations will ensure <i><b>all </b></i>team members will have travel, comfortable lodging, and some money for food during the five day competition. <br/><br/> <ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Big Picture Impact of Your Contribution<br/>
</h3>Donating to this fundraiser doesn't just support this year's national slam team. Your donation supports the slam poetry movement - a contribution to spoken word art for the people, by the people. The slam poetry stage is a unique arena where the most controversial and impactful of subjects have space to breathe, and stir a captive audience of participants. <br/><br/>Your donation also supports the arts in Hawaii. Hawaii is a land known for its vibrant and distinct indigenous culture, rich with dance, crafts, mythologies, and story telling arts. With such a strong oral tradition, even an urban-birthed form like slam has had fertile ground to grow on Hawaii's shores.<br/><br/>

<ul> </ul> </div> <p><br/></p><br/></div>","Aloha ya'll - and mahalo for checking our fundraiser!

Your donation directly supports the Hawaii National Slam Poetry Team in their journey to compete in Oakland this year. Over 70 teams will be facing off, from cities across the nation. Will Hawaii rank in the top five for the second year in a row? Only one way to find out . . . 
All donations will go toward sending our 2015 slam poetry reps - and their coach - to the national show down. If you're curious about how the funds will be distributed, these are our fundraising goals, in order of priority:


Airline ticket for coach

Hotel rooms 

Per diems for each poet
Although the team already has four airline tickets and one hotel room paid for by Hawaii Slam, your donations will ensure all team members will have travel, comfortable lodging, and some money for food during the five day competition.     The Big Picture Impact of Your Contribution
Donating to this fundraiser doesn't just support this year's national slam team. Your donation supports the slam poetry movement - a contribution to spoken word art for the people, by the people. The slam poetry stage is a unique arena where the most controversial and impactful of subjects have space to breathe, and stir a captive audience of participants. Your donation also supports the arts in Hawaii. Hawaii is a land known for its vibrant and distinct indigenous culture, rich with dance, crafts, mythologies, and story telling arts. With such a strong oral tradition, even an urban-birthed form like slam has had fertile ground to grow on Hawaii's shores.

Please find these postcards that deliver you Japanese cultures and atmospheres. We started Post air project to offer postcards with iconic Japanese' sights, full of cultures and traditions to people around the world. But we didn’t stop there. 
Not like any postcards, a vintage flavored photo decorates the front, but on the back you can find a QR code that can be scanned by your smart device's QR code reader. You will experience a 360 degree panorama view of the landscape that is shown on the front for a life-like immersive experience. Here is an example(you had better try by your smartphone);This is the famous “Shibuya Scramble Crossing”.http://post-air.com/vol1/shibuya_1.html



Try it! How do you feel ?
Send these postcards to your family and friends. They will feel as if they are actually walking along the street of Japan.Or keep these postcards on your desk for a 360 degree visual trip to Japan.We are proud of delivering Japan’s unique cultures to you and important people around you.Thank you so much for visiting our project.We will release next series this year so we are appreciate your support!

We have more Scenic Japanese Postcards!!
   We need your support to release many series of Japanese cities, at first, Kyoto, Kanagawa and Tohoku.  
Our target funding is USD 12,500.
When we make 10 postcards with 360 degree panorama view, we need to plan logistics, hire a photographer, use 5 days to take photos by single-lens reflex camera & 360 degree panorama camera, ask a designer to retouch, upload photos to a server, issue QR codes and order postcards for publishing. We estimate it costs USD 2-3K for one series(10 cards) for one city. 
If we achieve the goal we will make at least 5 series in Japan. We want to turn a spotlight on  rural areas. There are many places that are not famous to foreign travelers, even for domestic travelers. In Japan, those rural areas have unique traditions and cultures but they are vanishing.
Do you remember Tohoku area?
Tohoku, a northeastern part of Japan, suffered from the catastrophe tsunami in 2011.  Tohoku area has not overcome yet. We know Tohoku area has full of rich traditions, cultures and landscapes. We are eager to let you know Tohoku and contribute recovery of post-tsunami Tohoku by showing scenic photos and attracting tourists.
We are planning to take this images;
https://www.pinterest.com/postair/tohoku-especially-miyagi-iwate-fukushima/







If we don't reach our entire goal, we still make postcards for many cities after earning margin. As a startup company, we have limited resources so it's not easy to hire distributors and retailers. But our enthusiasm to spread our postcards with 360 degree panorama view will not end after this project!

Vimeo: CEO message

   The Impact We think this technology is a new archive for vanishing cultures, traditions and landscapes. There are videos to record but it's not easy to access from smartphone because of size. Our solution is invented particularly for smartphone because you only need to scan QR code on paper(postcard, brochure, report and so on).

    Possible Risks & Challenges We recognize our risks;


OS issue : iOS devices(iPhone&iPad) don't have QR code reader. We did not test all Android OS devices so we can not guarantee you can scan QR code. We recommend you to install free QR code reader to your device.  
Bandwidth : If you are in circumstance where you have poor internet connection, it is not smooth to show 360 degree panorama view.

We have next challenges;


360 movie : We are planning to test and deploy 360 degree panorama movie next year. We may offer you another life-changing experience!
B2B biz : We recognize this 360 degree panorama view can be applied to business use. We have meetings with companies to prospect business needs.


    Other Ways You Can Help

We know that sometime you may not have interest in Japanese postcards or our story. But if you know someone who like Japanese cultures, please let them tell our project.
Your recommendations and sharings to SNS are also a huge support for us!(日本語)360°パノラマ画像を使った絵葉書で、日本の文化や風景を世界中にアピールします観光地で見かける絵葉書はありきたりではありませんか？わたしたちは絵葉書に360°パノラマ画像を見ることができるQRコードを追加し、あたかもその場に立っているような気分が味わえる体験をできるようにしました。外国人受けする被写体を選定して絵葉書にしていますが、日本人の皆さんでも楽しめるものです！ぜひ渋谷のスクランブル交差点の360°パノラマ画像をスマホで試してみてください。指で画像を動かすこともできますし、スマホを傾けて見たいところを見ることができます。

今後の展開：京都版・神奈川版・東北版の作成 

このプロジェクトで150万円のゴールを設定しています。
もしこのゴールを達成できれば、絵葉書を最低5シリーズ発売できます。
1シリーズ作成にかかる費用（約20-30万円）：調査費用、カメラマン日当、一眼レフ写真画像修正費、360°パノラマ画像加工費、試作版印刷費、カメラマンの日当、交通費、撮影場所によっては宿泊費
当初は大都市ばかりですが、わたしたちの計画が順調に行けば訪日外国人どころか日本人でさえあまり訪れない知名度の低い場所にスポットライトを当てることができ、観光客誘致や地方復興の手助けになると考えています。

</h3>Hi! I’m Aluna Ille and I’m in my final year as a master student at the Faculty of Arts and Design in Cluj-Napoca. This year my city is the European Youth Capital and because I have a passionate heart for different cultures and the people that vivifies and inspire them, I believe that this year is the perfect opportunity for my piece of artwork to have a voice! <br/><br/>The artwork will be exhibited at the University of Arts and Design 
graduates<br/>exhibition, that is ""The greatest manifestation of the 
artistic society in Romania. The exhibition is the result of an enormous
 effort from students, parents and teachers"" said the President of the 
University of Arts and Design, John Sbârciu.<br/><br/>The interesting thing about my artwork is that it will not only be an ergonomic object but will be a voice, a call and invitation to peace, friendship 
and harmony in these times of conflict, war and division. A call for the
 new generation that will have the power in their hands soon. My work is
 not limited to a comfortable, lovely object. It will have a story to 
tell, it will be a symbol and a way of unceasingly raising awareness of 
the value of life. <br/><br/><h3>The Concept</h3>I have designed a set of 2 swings. As for me the flight symbolizes a 
liberation and detachment from human powerlessness. I aspired for a way 
to save the broken, fragmented, unstable earth. So the concept of my 
swings is born in the middle of the earth and is created from a perfect 
sphere, but suffers from separation, alteration and leakage  due to 
the conflicts, preconceptions, cruelty and indifference of mankind.<br/>I
 chose to split the earth into two parts, as a symbol of relationship. The
 relationship is the essence, the juncture between both the fall  and the ascension. <br/><br/>So my
 swings as a means of escaping degradation asked me to save them and I
 gave them their flight. I transformed their deformation into a 
different formation. The remains of my spheres gradually started to metamorphose into wings. This very metaphor is only for the heart, as the heart is the only one that can overcome human helplessness. And if the heart hears and if the heart sees, then it ought to let go of all the preconceptions and heavy barriers in order to fly.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Needs <br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The sad thing is that the university does not support us financially in 
all of our major projects. The alternative is a mediocre
 project that does not represent me, but that can help me in 
getting a diploma. I dare to hope and to want more, I want to believe 
that art is not going to die but will live in the hearts of those who 
are inspired by it.<br/></p>
<p>So here’s where you can help:</p>
Cost for the entire project: 1,500 euro (1632 USD)<br/><ul>
<li>600 Euro (653 USD) for plywood: the swings that I have designed will be made of plywood, creating the form through the contour lines. The swings are over 1 meter long, the plywood is 2.5 cm thick, and so I will need many boards. <br/>
</li>
<li>400 Euro (435 USD) for swing holders: the swing holders will be made of metal in order to sustain such a massive weight.  <br/>
</li>
<li>500 Euro (544 USD) for the manufacturing cost of the whole artwork. <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I want my work to be interactive and belong to everyone! The swings will be placed in a chalk writing area, so all those who want to get rid of their preconceptions, envy, jealousy, hate and will be invited to write their decision and fly the liberation flight! Nothing else will matter except that we have but the same heart that beats for life, love and peace. </p>
<p>I have to accomplish my Master’s project regardless of whether I will raise 
financial support or not. But if I do, I will be able to make a change 
in design presentation approaches from the interactivity point of view. 
And this will have a great impact on young designers encouraging them 
not to compromise art due to the lack of resources and not to kill their
 ideas by being forced to be mediocre. <br/></p>
<p>If I will not manage to raise 
all the support here, I will also try elsewhere. If nothing works and I 
will still not have all the money I need for the project, I have to 
limit myself to the resources I have access to and to create a mediocre 
work. In this case, I will refund your money.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Achievements</h3>In the last 2 years of high school a National artistic contest is organized. In the National artistic contest that I was chosen to participate in, I won the third place. The last project I created was my artwork for my Bachelor's Degree Thesis, accredited with 10 points out of 10 and the title “Magna Cum Laude”. <br/><br/>You can find out more details here:<br/> <a href=""http://ziarulfaclia.ro/arte-expo-transilvania-iunie-iulie-2013-expozitia-absolventilor-uad/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://ziarulfaclia.ro/arte-expo-transilvania-iunie-iulie-2013-expozitia-absolventilor-uad/</a><br/><br/><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There will be great challenges, but there are challenges in every stage of a project, like there were in working on my Bachelor's Degree Thesis.  The polystyrene model had to be cut automatically with a polystyrene carving machine. After a month of vectorization and three-dimensional designing, the workers decided the project was too complex. So in the last month I started to do it manually. It was the most exhausting month of intensive work of my life. It was extremely demanding and risky, but the result was so rewarding. Honestly I did not expect to finish it in time, but I pushed myself to the limit because I could not accept failure. Challenges have already occurred in the swing project but I have not let them defeat my passion.</p>

And this will have a great impact on young designers encouraging them 
not to compromise art due to the lack of resources and not to kill their
 ideas by being forced to be mediocre. 
If I will not manage to raise 
all the support here, I will also try elsewhere. If nothing works and I 
will still not have all the money I need for the project, I have to 
limit myself to the resources I have access to and to create a mediocre 
work. In this case, I will refund your money.
  AchievementsIn the last 2 years of high school a National artistic contest is organized. In the National artistic contest that I was chosen to participate in, I won the third place. The last project I created was my artwork for my Bachelor's Degree Thesis, accredited with 10 points out of 10 and the title “Magna Cum Laude”. You can find out more details here: http://ziarulfaclia.ro/arte-expo-transilvania-iunie-iulie-2013-expozitia-absolventilor-uad/Risks & Challenges
There will be great challenges, but there are challenges in every stage of a project, like there were in working on my Bachelor's Degree Thesis.  The polystyrene model had to be cut automatically with a polystyrene carving machine. After a month of vectorization and three-dimensional designing, the workers decided the project was too complex. So in the last month I started to do it manually. It was the most exhausting month of intensive work of my life. It was extremely demanding and risky, but the result was so rewarding. Honestly I did not expect to finish it in time, but I pushed myself to the limit because I could not accept failure. Challenges have already occurred in the swing project but I have not let them defeat my passion.

<p>I am a fine art photographer and traditional darkroom printer located in Brooklyn, NY. I've decided to publish a book of my work to extend the world of my prints to all those who desire the magic of In Rooms. In the winter of 2011 I began photographing ""In Rooms"", which has evolved into an ongoing narrative documenting my most vibrant thoughts, dreams and observations about the human experience. In 2012 I moved to New York and immediately joined an introductory traditional black and white printing. I have remained self taught ever since and now print all of my photographs at a darkroom in Brooklyn.  </p>

<p>I create because I have to; it gives me vitality. That being said, it is my hope that people are able to enjoy my work, that it inspires those who seek to have it in their lives. Whilst social media and the internet has made it possible to enjoy art from our computers and phones, I feel living with art and having a tangible object such as a book or print  resonants with the viewer in deeper, more personal way. Owning gallery prints, especially a large collection of works is out of the financial realm of possibilities for so many people, myself included. This is why I feel inspiration to create a book, a more affordable keepsake that allows a viewer intimate access to an artist's world. The photo books I've collected over time have changed my life; there have been countless times when I've needed them, and looking through them has realigned and rejuvenated parts of my troubled and hungry soul.  It has been my dream to have this narrative, In Rooms, unfold in the pages of a high quality book and I am excited to have found the perfect publisher to do so. </p>

If I go over the goal I will hopefully continue to sell copies of the book. At this point I can also consider adding 10-30pgs to the book to include more images.

<p>There are many little ways to
enlarge your child’s world. Love of books is the best of all. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">–Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis</span></p>
<p>New
York City is currently facing a literacy crisis and Queens is not immune from
its effects. Many of the children in Queens do not enter school with the tools
that they need to succeed. According to 2013-2014 English Language Arts
standardized test scores, <b>70%</b> of New York City’s third grade
students are <b>reading <u>below</u> grade level</b>. Amongst
the City’s poor, <b>76%</b> <b>are <u>not</u> reading on
grade level</b>. Once these students fall behind, it becomes increasingly
difficult for them to catch up.</p>
<p>We
need those numbers to change. </p>
<p>The Queens Book Festival
(QBF) is a
grassroots project begun by Queens’ residents in the fall of 2014. We've
incorporated and become an organization dedicated to creating tangible change
in the literacy challenge facing the children in the borough, and have been
thrilled at the support we've received from organizations, writers, artists,
businesses throughout NYC. The
Festival, debuting in June 2016, will introduce the borough and area residents,
especially the children and young adults, to the many facets and genres within
the literary world including new and immerging technologies that revolutionize
how the written word is consumed. You can read more about our
mission <a href=""http://queensbookfestival.nyc/about/mission-vision/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span></span></a><a href=""http://www.queensbookfestival.nyc/#!mission---vision/bf4ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. </p>
<p>To date we've been a
volunteer corps surviving on vigor and verve alone - but we can and will do so
much more with your help. </p>
<p>With
your donation, QBF will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Create a Pop-up Bookstore</b>: With your support,
     we’ll be able to stage beautiful mobile bookstores throughout the borough
     featuring the works of Queens authors. Our partners will be curating the
     talented writers, authors and poets. They will also provide updated
     furniture pieces and bookshelves for the books to be displayed upon. Plus,
     the borough residents and youth will have the opportunity to meet and chat
     with their favorite local authors. You’ll help us purchase the inventory
     for the shelves, get the word out to the public, cover the traveling
     expenses of our partners and keep our authors fed, shorn, and mostly
     clothed. </li>
<li>
<b>Early Intervention: </b>EI is a lifeline and
     starting point for parents and children on any point of the Autistic
     spectrum. As this reality becomes more concrete, many families come to the
     realization that they are not equipped with the proper tools to help their
     children along in the process. Those tools include the simplest things,
     toys and books, and some are even unable to purchase them. We want to
     assist parents and caretakers of children in early intervention get access
     to these books. We intend on doing this by holding a book drive in the
     Spring of 2016 to collect and distribute these much need items to parents,
     ABA teachers, speech therapists, occupational therapists, and physical
     therapists whom all care for the needs of autistic children.</li>
<li>
<b>Develop the first major
     literary crawl in Queens:</b> This event will be the first of its kind
     in the borough. Not only will it highlight our talented authors, it will
     showcase our local businesses, and sponsors. This is an opportunity to expose
     the adults in the community to the local writers, poets, and other
     literary projects that operate throughout the year. </li>
<li>
<b>Promote diverse programming</b>: QBF will have an active
     presence in the community from March 2016 till mid-May 2016, where we will
     be quenching its insatiable fun in the sun appetite. We will be honoring
     the work of local authors with book release parties, pop-up events, and
     live performances. </li>
<li>
<b>Host QBF’s Inaugural
     Festival</b>:
     The event will be a celebration of literacy and literature. Of the
     100+ authors invited to speak, a third will be local, and a third
     national; 200+ exhibitors from independent bookstores, publishers,
     literary nonprofits, writing programs, library services, and literacy
     programs—making the Queens Book Festival the most international public
     literary festival in the borough. </li>

</div></div>","What is the Queens Book Festival? 
There are many little ways to
enlarge your child’s world. Love of books is the best of all. –Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis
New
York City is currently facing a literacy crisis and Queens is not immune from
its effects. Many of the children in Queens do not enter school with the tools
that they need to succeed. According to 2013-2014 English Language Arts
standardized test scores, 70% of New York City’s third grade
students are reading below grade level. Amongst
the City’s poor, 76% are not reading on
grade level. Once these students fall behind, it becomes increasingly
difficult for them to catch up.
We
need those numbers to change. 
The Queens Book Festival
(QBF) is a
grassroots project begun by Queens’ residents in the fall of 2014. We've
incorporated and become an organization dedicated to creating tangible change
in the literacy challenge facing the children in the borough, and have been
thrilled at the support we've received from organizations, writers, artists,
businesses throughout NYC. The
Festival, debuting in June 2016, will introduce the borough and area residents,
especially the children and young adults, to the many facets and genres within
the literary world including new and immerging technologies that revolutionize
how the written word is consumed. You can read more about our
mission here. 
To date we've been a
volunteer corps surviving on vigor and verve alone - but we can and will do so
much more with your help. 
With
your donation, QBF will be able to:


Create a Pop-up Bookstore: With your support,
     we’ll be able to stage beautiful mobile bookstores throughout the borough
     featuring the works of Queens authors. Our partners will be curating the
     talented writers, authors and poets. They will also provide updated
     furniture pieces and bookshelves for the books to be displayed upon. Plus,
     the borough residents and youth will have the opportunity to meet and chat
     with their favorite local authors. You’ll help us purchase the inventory
     for the shelves, get the word out to the public, cover the traveling
     expenses of our partners and keep our authors fed, shorn, and mostly
     clothed. 

Early Intervention: EI is a lifeline and
     starting point for parents and children on any point of the Autistic
     spectrum. As this reality becomes more concrete, many families come to the
     realization that they are not equipped with the proper tools to help their
     children along in the process. Those tools include the simplest things,
     toys and books, and some are even unable to purchase them. We want to
     assist parents and caretakers of children in early intervention get access
     to these books. We intend on doing this by holding a book drive in the
     Spring of 2016 to collect and distribute these much need items to parents,
     ABA teachers, speech therapists, occupational therapists, and physical
     therapists whom all care for the needs of autistic children.

Develop the first major
     literary crawl in Queens: This event will be the first of its kind
     in the borough. Not only will it highlight our talented authors, it will
     showcase our local businesses, and sponsors. This is an opportunity to expose
     the adults in the community to the local writers, poets, and other
     literary projects that operate throughout the year. 

Promote diverse programming: QBF will have an active
     presence in the community from March 2016 till mid-May 2016, where we will
     be quenching its insatiable fun in the sun appetite. We will be honoring
     the work of local authors with book release parties, pop-up events, and
     live performances. 

Host QBF’s Inaugural
     Festival:
     The event will be a celebration of literacy and literature. Of the
     100+ authors invited to speak, a third will be local, and a third
     national; 200+ exhibitors from independent bookstores, publishers,
     literary nonprofits, writing programs, library services, and literacy
     programs—making the Queens Book Festival the most international public
     literary festival in the borough.

<p>We estimate that we need
in excess of $2,500 per person to cover our travel, lodging, food, and
miscellaneous costs to be able to attend Schmuck. As a student group we have
been working on raising funds for over a year through hosting auctions of
original work on Facebook, participating in jewelry sales throughout our region,
holding campus specific events such as “Make your own Keychain” sales and face
painting during football weekends, and through applying to individual and group
grants and fellowships. We have been thrilled at the amount of support from our
professional field and our campus community, but there is still a large gap between
what we have raised so far and what is needed. We are hoping that by
reaching out, we will receive aid to help us attend Schmuck and take advantage
of this professional and creative opportunity. </p><p><br/></p>

</div></div>","Schmuck, also known as
Munich Jewellery Week, is an internationally renowned weeklong art jewelry fair
in Munich, Germany taking place from February 24th to March 3rd 2016. Annually held for over fifty years, Schmuck is attended by over a hundred thousand makers, designers,
dealers, and collectors that come to experience the over eighty individual
exhibitions, lectures, and events throughout Munich in conjunction with
Schmuck. 
Who We Are

This Indiegogo campaign
is run by, and will directly benefit the six MFA candidates in Metal from University
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC): Clare Finin and Jina Seo (3rd
years), Evin Dubois and Caitlin Skelcey (2nd years), Akiceri
Alejandra (Ale) Carrillo-Estrada and Christina (Tina) McNealy (1st
years). As graduate students preparing to enter the professional world of
Metals and Jewelry, we realize the importance of professional networking that
attending Schmuck would provide, as well as the creative inspiration from
seeing such a diverse and international range of work. Why We Need Help
We estimate that we need
in excess of $2,500 per person to cover our travel, lodging, food, and
miscellaneous costs to be able to attend Schmuck. As a student group we have
been working on raising funds for over a year through hosting auctions of
original work on Facebook, participating in jewelry sales throughout our region,
holding campus specific events such as “Make your own Keychain” sales and face
painting during football weekends, and through applying to individual and group
grants and fellowships. We have been thrilled at the amount of support from our
professional field and our campus community, but there is still a large gap between
what we have raised so far and what is needed. We are hoping that by
reaching out, we will receive aid to help us attend Schmuck and take advantage
of this professional and creative opportunity. 
What's In It For YouBy donating you will be filled with a sense of pride that you are a supporter of students and the arts! To show our appreciation we have designed and
made a variety of thank you gifts specifically for this campaign. Most campaign gifts will ship mid-December just in time for a last minute holiday gift. $5- An email from us to you, expressing our gratitude.$15- A sticker featuring Billie Theide(one sticker per $15 donation)
$ 25- A postcard from Germany (will ship late February)


$ 50- An edition print of a poster of Germany

$150- A refined 3D printed Gem brooch




$250- a pair of sterling silver earrings


$500- Everything: a Billie Theide sticker, a postcard from Germany, a poster of germany, a refined 3D printed brooch, a pair of sterling silver earrings, a Facebook highlight, and our eternal gratitude

<p>Established in 2013, Interview Room 11 is an artist-led gallery based in Edinburgh, Scotland. For the past three years we ran a gallery space at the Argyle House, a 60s brutalist office building and former job centre in the heart of Edinburgh, as part of Forest Center Plus with studios and working facilities for over 80 artists. We held over 15 exhibitions, published ten exhibition catalogues, participated in two art fairs and welcomed hundreds of visitors from in and outside Edinburgh. Our main goal is to promote the work of Scottish artists and to provide a platform for exchange to the local community.  Due to our contract we were facing homelessness by the end of November.</p>
<p>However, our friends from Kalopsia, a textile design collective at the commercial complex of Ocean Terminal have offered to support us with a space and keep the gallery project alive.</p>

<p><b>Who we are</b></p>
<p>Crescent Comics is the

and appeal to people from all faiths and backgrounds.</span></p>
<p>Abdul Qadim Haqq originally made
his name from designing graphics and label artwork which was grounded in
futurism for the now legendary Detroit techno group Underground Resistance
which symbolized messages of struggle with cutting edge audio/visual
productions. Since 1989 he has been at the forefront of providing artistic
direction for global music labels and has exhibited work in Japan, UK and even
in his hometown of Detroit.</p>
<p>Those that may be familiar
with some of Abdul’s work will notice a strong theme and style based in comic
book art and concepts. </p>
<p>Abdul’s decision to create
Crescent Comics came from his passion for the comic genre and also to create a
counter narrative to the ever growing negative perception of Muslims portrayed
by mass media and to how diverse art in Islam can really be.</p>
<p>The vision of Crescent Comics
is to introduce people to a new generation of Muslim superheroes that will
inspire, entertain and bring <span>enlightenment to those
that choose to listen to a universal message of peace.

</span></p><p><b>Why we need help to raise money?</b></p>

<p>Whilst artwork

<p>   Jon Hamm, Samuel L. Jackson, and Kristen Wiig all became household
names well past their twenties and thirties.  Michael Emerson was about to give up acting
when he moved to Florida, and Ang Lee took a computer class at thirty,
considering filmmaking to be a dead dream at that point.  Many equally talented artists are out there
right now, and are losing their motivation, their inspiration, every day.  The world won’t know their work.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447382024/mpoxt85eczofttrz66h2.jpg"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;""/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">   One of the biggest challenges for
each artist living in the modern world, is to balance the time they are able to
dedicate to their craft, with the time that they need to dedicate to all those
activities that pay their rent.  </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Almost all of them find jobs in other sectors, in order to sustain the
cost of living.  Some have to take on
more than one odd job in order to get by.  Before you can say ""enough,"" a week becomes a month, then a year, and finally a decade goes by.  You look around, and you're still in square one with this free-spirited lover you left home for.  Years spent chasing after something that doesn’t seem to love you back.  Expensive seminars, unpaid gigs, inaccessible
casting calls, and lengthy audition processes, are just some of the everyday
struggles that an artist has to face.  Expected to survive upon being released all on his/her own into this ever-changing jungle, without the necessary guidance to adapt, nor the essential tools to evolve from Theatre Film TV student to Theatre Film TV working professional.</span><br/></p>

</div></div>","Why
the world needs Tres Artis:
   Jon Hamm, Samuel L. Jackson, and Kristen Wiig all became household
names well past their twenties and thirties.  Michael Emerson was about to give up acting
when he moved to Florida, and Ang Lee took a computer class at thirty,
considering filmmaking to be a dead dream at that point.  Many equally talented artists are out there
right now, and are losing their motivation, their inspiration, every day.  The world won’t know their work.   One of the biggest challenges for
each artist living in the modern world, is to balance the time they are able to
dedicate to their craft, with the time that they need to dedicate to all those
activities that pay their rent.  Almost all of them find jobs in other sectors, in order to sustain the
cost of living.  Some have to take on
more than one odd job in order to get by.  Before you can say ""enough,"" a week becomes a month, then a year, and finally a decade goes by.  You look around, and you're still in square one with this free-spirited lover you left home for.  Years spent chasing after something that doesn’t seem to love you back.  Expensive seminars, unpaid gigs, inaccessible
casting calls, and lengthy audition processes, are just some of the everyday
struggles that an artist has to face.  Expected to survive upon being released all on his/her own into this ever-changing jungle, without the necessary guidance to adapt, nor the essential tools to evolve from Theatre Film TV student to Theatre Film TV working professional.
 
   This is where Tres Artis comes in.  Tres Artis is a new private community of Theatre Film & Television professionals, founded in New York City.  The members of our community are provided with Craft, Career, and Lifestyle opportunities; through accessible & effective Education, Networking, and Publicity services.  Membership is granted by interview or invitation only.   Tres Artis achieves all of this, through a team of qualified professionals cultivating individual connections with our members; we are here for you in art & in life.  Each artist will be treated as if he/she were the sole member of our community.  Besides facilitating the professional growth of each of our members, Tres Artis strives to connect the modern artist with the world that surrounds him/her. The ultimate goal being: to drive our pool of talent towards the creation of art-based volunteer initiatives & opportunities, in underprivileged communities around the world; through partnerships with humanitarian organizations. 


  
   We believe in humanity, and we need more human beings to believe in us.  But don’t just take our word for it…

</div></div>","Hello and welcome to our campaign page!Yan Cao is a fiber artist living and working in the lovely Savannah, Georgia. She just received her Master degrees from Savannah College of Art and Design(SCAD). This exhibition will be her first show in Savannah, she was
also invited by the Smithsonian Craft Show this year in Washington DC from
April 21st -24th, and the Student Fiber Trends 2016 held
in Claram. Eagle Gallery from May 19th to June 24th. She
is a very young artist from China who loves flower growing, cats and
travelling.
                          Litao Chen will also receive his Master degrees from SCAD, he majors in Arts
Administration and this exhibition will be conducted as his M.A. final project.
He had gained a lot of experiences from museum and gallery management and once
taken an intern in MCA, Chicago for half a year. This exhibition is his first
project as an individual administrator.
                                                      

The exhibition will be held at 406 E. Oglethorpe Ave. Savannah, Georgia.
May 13th
to 16th, 2016.
By supporting this project, you aren’t just
supporting a single exhibition for an SCAD student; you are enabling
community communication, education, and artistic exploration.

What We Need
The
breakdown of what this project money will be used for is as follows:

and Booklets Printing$143) will be $423.
Other expenses
(including exhibition area renting $500 and Desert & drinking $100) will be
$600.

Thus, I intent to raise $1400 funds to help me reducing the costs for organizing this exhibition. Since they are my friends, they do not charge me as they do normally. However, as a return, I promise I will offer lunches, dinners, beverages, transportation and the most important costs, the venue. The expense will be about $ 1400.
