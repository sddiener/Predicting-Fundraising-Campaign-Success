Hi guys, my
name is Perie Wolford and I’m an LGBT author.
I need a
little help covering editing expenses for my new gay novel, Lights. Lights is a
story about underwater UFOs and boy on boy romance.

   What I Need I need $500 to cover the editing expenses.
Even though I am a published author and I have a couple books on sale, the profit is not nearly enought to cover all of the expenses that go into self-publishing.
    What You Will Get I will be giving away my other books and audiobooks.

And of course you will receive a free copy of Lights, when it's ready.
    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't donate, but that doesn't mean they can't help:

I'm Taylor and I recently graduated from the University of Iowa. In February of 2014, I and other classmates were talking about what we have on our keychains to protect ourselves from sexual assault. The women and feminine identifying people and I rattled off our go-to methods...rape whistles, keys between our fingers, mace...these were all standard. The men in the room were taken aback that we even needed to think about this. Then, I knew that I had to visually represent this discrepancy in vulnerability. So, I created </span><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><a href=""http://www.tayloryo.com/photography-1/#/photography/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Guarded</a></i><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">.

In May of 2015 (my last few days of college...the craziest week of my life!), Guarded went viral. The story was picked up by HelloGiggles (and was shared by Zooey Deschanel!), then the Huffington Post, Mic.com, aplus.com, and Buzzfeed. I did interviews with local  stations (KWWL, KCRG, The Daily Iowan, and Iowa Public Radio) and my project was published by outlets such as the Des Moines Register and USA Today, The BTN and Vanity Fair Italy. It was truly hitting me...these photographs resonated with people. Even more importantly, I was receiving emails from women all over the world telling me that my project spoke to their stories. This was huge. At this point, I knew I had to keep the project going to tell more stories and speak to more experiences.

<h2>The Pitch </h2>
<h2>     <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://static.ddmcdn.com/gif/pitcher-curveball.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
</h2>
<p>When life throws you a curve ball, do you hit it or whiff? <em>I Swallowed the Camel </em>is a God-inspired writing in which I share insights on lessons I've learned the hard way, by living through them. Sometimes I've singled, sometimes a home run, and many times I struckout. </p>
<p>I had no intention of writing a book in 2012. However, through a series of events I had an aha moment when the Holy Spirit laid it all out, complete with title. <em>I Swallowed the Camel</em> comes from Matthew 23:24 when Jesus, while chastising the Pharisees for having their priorities misaligned, says ""You blind guides, straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel!""</p>
<p>So I started writing and over eight months, it all came together. It came in spurts and after dry spells. If I ever felt it becoming forced, I backed off praying for God to get me out of the way. Once, after about six-weeks of not writing, I awoke at two in the morning and ten hours later had written one of the lessons.</p>
<p>Each chapter begins with a quote, some well-known, some you may be hearing for the first time. That is followed by a Bible verse relating to the quote. The rest of the lesson features my experiences (good and bad), thoughts, insights, and perhaps a little inspiration.</p>
<p>Here's a sample from the first few paragraphs of one of the chapters:</p>
<h3 align=""center""><strong>Fail Forward</strong></h3>
<p>   “Don’t look back.  Something might be gaining on you.” ~ Satchel Paige</p>
<p><em>   But Jesus said to him, “No one, after putting his hand to the plow and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.” Luke 9:62 (NKJV)</em></p>
<p>   People tend to dwell on the past; somehow believing that thinking <span>about it and beating ourselves up over it will change it.  We mull over would’ve, could’ve </span>and should’ve thoughts to the point of paralyzation.  </p>
<p>   I rued past failures and missed opportunities, crippling me and keeping me from moving forward.  Focusing on the past steals our today and dooms our tomorrow.</p>
<p>   Yes, we need to learn from the past but understand that it does not dictate the future.  Or as Anthony Robbins is fond of saying, “The past does not equal the future.”  This, however, does not apply to loan officers at your bank!</p>
<p>   Long before Satchel Paige admonished us not to look back, the apostle Paul became the cornerstone of moving ahead when, in his letter to the Philippians, he writes “<em>but one thing I do; forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what</em><em> </em><em>lies</em><em> </em><em>ahead,</em><em> </em><em>I</em><em> </em><em>press on toward the goal for the prize of the</em><em> </em><em>upward call of God in</em><em> </em><em>Christ Jesus.” (Phil 3:13-14)  </em></p>
<p>   Paul is not telling us to develop amnesia.  He clearly remembers the day on the road to Damascus when he saw the light.  There is great value in lessons learned from experience.  However, he heeds us not to let life’s failures, sin, and regrets enslave us to the past and stifle the healing process from such hurts and painful memories.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>------------------------------------</strong></p>
<p>While it is a good read for anyone, the focus of the book is not directed at nonbelievers or the person on your street living fully in God's will. It is for those of us living on the bridge of conflict between pleasing God and surviving and prospering in the world.  This is not a book about me, it's about how God has molded me as the potter molds his clay and how He can lead you to fulfill the unique plans He has for you - Jeremiah 29:11. Each lesson will fall upon you dependent on the condition of personal relationship with God. </p>
<p> </p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The funding is all about pre-sales and the ability to execute a successful launch. The book is 99% complete, just some finetooth editing, dotting the i's and crossing the t's, followed by the pruduction cycle. A friend recommended a few sites such this to get the project funded and the book out into the marketplace. I selected Indiegogo for a variety of reasons.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Foremost is the safe way for you to support the project, receive a personal copy of the book at a discount and additional bonuses. </p>
<p>The $4500 funding goal is based on printing, distribution and marketing budgets. With an average pledge of $15, a total of 300 contributors would accomplish the goal. All monies received over and above the funding goal will be directed to further marketing efforts such as book signings, advertising and additional printing.</p>
<p>All copies distributed from funding pledges will be personally signed and  hardbacks will be signed and numbered. See the rewards section for specifics.</p>

<div class=""img_th"">“Have you ever wondered if the Bible is relevant today? I have and then I read, <em>I Swallowed the Camel</em>. Chet Wright brings many of the Bibles basic teaching to life in the context of his own life and within the context of some of the greatest quotes of modern day. Never preachy, Chet’s humble style, sharp wit and succinct writing style, is guaranteed to touch your heart and make you think about your relationship with God long after the last page is turned.”<br/>~ Lowell Amos, Author and Songwriter</div>

<p><em>""Reading Chet's book, I felt like I was being exposed to a treasure trove of riches. The amazing thing was, they were the riches that had been deposited and stored up in </em>his<em> soul -- diamonds refined by years of true living. I'm thrilled that they are now being shared with others...for a greater good and for the glory of God!!""  ~ </em>Christian Counselor Abbey Foard</p>
<p>My hope is for everyone to be <span>challenged and in doing so, know yourself <em>and</em> God better and have a stronger personal relationship with God than before you opened the book. </span></p>

<p>I guess Dan Fogelberg summed it up best in his song Nether Lands - </p>
<span class=""lc"">I`ve seen the bottom and I`ve been on top, but mostly I`ve lived in <br/>between...</span>
<p>Blessed with wonderful parents who raised me in South Bend, Indiana, I enjoyed a blissful childhood and graduated from Miami University, not to be confused with the 'U' in Florida. I was married for 24 years and my ex is the best friend I have today. God gave us the gift of our son, Anthony, of whom we are quite proud. He and his wife, Nancy, are nearby with the grandchildren, Vince and Alice.</p>
<p>The path my life has traveled has taken me through various and sundry places with all the peaks and valleys one experiences in life.</p>
<p>I thank God for all the places I've been because it has bought me to the place where the most important aspect of life is my relationship with Him. And you know what? Now all my relationships are stronger than they have ever been. With my ex, with my son and his wife, my grandchildren, family and friends.</p>

</div></div>","The Pitch 
     

When life throws you a curve ball, do you hit it or whiff? I Swallowed the Camel is a God-inspired writing in which I share insights on lessons I've learned the hard way, by living through them. Sometimes I've singled, sometimes a home run, and many times I struckout. 
I had no intention of writing a book in 2012. However, through a series of events I had an aha moment when the Holy Spirit laid it all out, complete with title. I Swallowed the Camel comes from Matthew 23:24 when Jesus, while chastising the Pharisees for having their priorities misaligned, says ""You blind guides, straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel!""
So I started writing and over eight months, it all came together. It came in spurts and after dry spells. If I ever felt it becoming forced, I backed off praying for God to get me out of the way. Once, after about six-weeks of not writing, I awoke at two in the morning and ten hours later had written one of the lessons.
Each chapter begins with a quote, some well-known, some you may be hearing for the first time. That is followed by a Bible verse relating to the quote. The rest of the lesson features my experiences (good and bad), thoughts, insights, and perhaps a little inspiration.
Here's a sample from the first few paragraphs of one of the chapters:
Fail Forward
   “Don’t look back.  Something might be gaining on you.” ~ Satchel Paige
   But Jesus said to him, “No one, after putting his hand to the plow and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.” Luke 9:62 (NKJV)
   People tend to dwell on the past; somehow believing that thinking about it and beating ourselves up over it will change it.  We mull over would’ve, could’ve and should’ve thoughts to the point of paralyzation.  
   I rued past failures and missed opportunities, crippling me and keeping me from moving forward.  Focusing on the past steals our today and dooms our tomorrow.
   Yes, we need to learn from the past but understand that it does not dictate the future.  Or as Anthony Robbins is fond of saying, “The past does not equal the future.”  This, however, does not apply to loan officers at your bank!
   Long before Satchel Paige admonished us not to look back, the apostle Paul became the cornerstone of moving ahead when, in his letter to the Philippians, he writes “but one thing I do; forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.” (Phil 3:13-14)  
   Paul is not telling us to develop amnesia.  He clearly remembers the day on the road to Damascus when he saw the light.  There is great value in lessons learned from experience.  However, he heeds us not to let life’s failures, sin, and regrets enslave us to the past and stifle the healing process from such hurts and painful memories.
------------------------------------
While it is a good read for anyone, the focus of the book is not directed at nonbelievers or the person on your street living fully in God's will. It is for those of us living on the bridge of conflict between pleasing God and surviving and prospering in the world.  This is not a book about me, it's about how God has molded me as the potter molds his clay and how He can lead you to fulfill the unique plans He has for you - Jeremiah 29:11. Each lesson will fall upon you dependent on the condition of personal relationship with God. 
 
The Fund


      



The funding is all about pre-sales and the ability to execute a successful launch. The book is 99% complete, just some finetooth editing, dotting the i's and crossing the t's, followed by the pruduction cycle. A friend recommended a few sites such this to get the project funded and the book out into the marketplace. I selected Indiegogo for a variety of reasons.


Foremost is the safe way for you to support the project, receive a personal copy of the book at a discount and additional bonuses. 
The $4500 funding goal is based on printing, distribution and marketing budgets. With an average pledge of $15, a total of 300 contributors would accomplish the goal. All monies received over and above the funding goal will be directed to further marketing efforts such as book signings, advertising and additional printing.
All copies distributed from funding pledges will be personally signed and  hardbacks will be signed and numbered. See the rewards section for specifics.
 


The Impact  


“Have you ever wondered if the Bible is relevant today? I have and then I read, I Swallowed the Camel. Chet Wright brings many of the Bibles basic teaching to life in the context of his own life and within the context of some of the greatest quotes of modern day. Never preachy, Chet’s humble style, sharp wit and succinct writing style, is guaranteed to touch your heart and make you think about your relationship with God long after the last page is turned.”~ Lowell Amos, Author and Songwriter
 
 
            



 
""Reading Chet's book, I felt like I was being exposed to a treasure trove of riches. The amazing thing was, they were the riches that had been deposited and stored up in his soul -- diamonds refined by years of true living. I'm thrilled that they are now being shared with others...for a greater good and for the glory of God!!""  ~ Christian Counselor Abbey Foard
My hope is for everyone to be challenged and in doing so, know yourself and God better and have a stronger personal relationship with God than before you opened the book. 
 
Taking the Next Step


         





 


If you would like a copy of the book, select your pledge.




The retail price on the books are proposed to be $15.95 (paperback) and $24.95 (hardback). Hardbacks in first printing will be numbered. The eBook is a $4 value and the poster - priceless!
           
I am hopeful to have the book available in late February. However, my 20+ years publishing experience leads me to add a month and, therefore, the perks section indicates an April release. 
If you have any questions or comments, please email me at iswallowedthecamel@gmail.com or call 678.760.1383. 
If you know anyone who might be interersted, please send them the link to this page, there are many share tools built within this site.
And that’s all there is to it. Thank you and blessings for 2013.
 
Author! Author! 

I guess Dan Fogelberg summed it up best in his song Nether Lands - 
I`ve seen the bottom and I`ve been on top, but mostly I`ve lived in between...
Blessed with wonderful parents who raised me in South Bend, Indiana, I enjoyed a blissful childhood and graduated from Miami University, not to be confused with the 'U' in Florida. I was married for 24 years and my ex is the best friend I have today. God gave us the gift of our son, Anthony, of whom we are quite proud. He and his wife, Nancy, are nearby with the grandchildren, Vince and Alice.
The path my life has traveled has taken me through various and sundry places with all the peaks and valleys one experiences in life.
I thank God for all the places I've been because it has bought me to the place where the most important aspect of life is my relationship with Him. And you know what? Now all my relationships are stronger than they have ever been. With my ex, with my son and his wife, my grandchildren, family and friends.
You'll read about some of the things I've done if you buy the book. But they are just things and the most important things in life aren't things. May God bless.
                                                         Thanks,
                                                            Chet",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hey I'm Casey Higgins (professionally) AKA Casey Clougherty (in reality).  First of all I want to thank you with all my heart for reading this!  My goal is to inspire guitar players with my books and to record beautiful music for you.    I'm really excited about releasing these books!  They are the first 2 installments of the Guitar Mechanics Series, Foundation/Rudiments, and Soloing.  After decades of searching for an instructional book that has everything in one place and teaches you fundamental things like how to figure out what key you're in or how to learn a song, I gave up and wrote one myself.  What started out as an exercise to see how much I knew about the guitar turned into a consolidation of almost my entire music library!  I honestly believe these books will help guitarists get to the next level and fill a huge gap in guitar education.  My hope is that they will inspire you to grow as an artist and help you get your music out into the world.  </p>
<p>  In appreciation of you I will be giving away my favorite tracks from the vault for free!  Stay tuned for more info and go here for a sample of my music:  <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/casey-higgins%E2%80%A8%E2%80%A8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://soundcloud.com/casey-higgins  </a></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plan</strong></p>
<p> I am asking for money to update my recording software so I can record examples for my ebook, a camera to record video examples, and funds to fix/update my equipment so I at least sound pretty.  Can't do anything about the face, sorry…  I also need to print books as well as pay for shipping to send the books to you, my sponsors, and colleagues for promotion.  If I don't get to my goal of $4000, the money I do get will go to making you your gifts and making the book into an ebook.  I'll just cut the promotional budget.    </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What I Hope To Accomplish</strong></p>
<p> -My main goal is to inspire aspiring guitarists and make it easier for them to improve and find their own voice on the instrument. </p>
<p>-I want to complete my home studio and rig so I can start recording video and audio examples for the ebooks. </p>
<p>-I need to get my books and music to Curt Mangan Strings, whom I have an endorsement deal with. </p>
<p>-I want to get my books and music online and in stores.  I already have a few stores interested!</p>
<p>In addition, this will allow me to finish an album for The Casey Higgins Band (real original name right?)</p>

<p><strong>  About me</strong></p>
<p> I've had an exciting career which started when I was 1 year old and got my first guitar which was bigger than me!  By 7 I started taking guitar lessons and had my first 2 gigs/recitals.  In junior high I jammed with and learned a ton from Erick Walls who now plays with Mary J. Blige.    </p>
<p>My 18th year was an amazing one where I got to play at the Bluebird Cafe in Nashville and was featured on NPR around the world.  It was unreal hearing myself on the radio and that was probably the second most awesome thing that has ever happened to me besides getting an endorsement deal with Curt Mangan Strings in 2007.    </p>
<p>In 2000 I was accepted to the Appalachian State University School of Music on the condition that I learn how to read music within 2 months.  Somehow I accomplished this goal and became the youngest member of 1st chair freshmen year and sophomore year I became the youngest section leader. </p>
<p>The major turning point and best year of my life was 2003 when I attended the Atlanta Institute of Music.  It was amazing being around such cool and talented players!  I learned a ton and made lots of life-long friends.  I was also incredibly surprised that they asked me to headline the graduation concert!  While in Atlanta I jammed with members of Black Cherry (Outcast's backing band), I did a clinic with Sean O'Rourke (one of my favorite drummers!), started a summer camp called Rock U and I opened for Flock of Seagulls.  Yea they played that song… Twice!  </p>
<p>Next I moved to Savannah in 2007 and joined Hitman and the Blues Boys.  That same year we won best blues band from Connect Magazine!  The real thrill came when I got to play with Jack Sherman from the Red Hot Chili Peppers!  He could say more with 5 notes than I could with 20 and I learned a lot from him.  He also played with some guy named Bob Dylan. </p>
<p>  From there things went downhill…  I tore three tendons in my left hand index finger and was diagnosed with TMJ disorder and chronic pain.  I have been struggling with chronic pain ever since, but now I have a great support system, awesome dog and I know how to better deal with it.  All thru this music has been my saving grace giving me hope and courage to keep following my dreams.  I guess that's what these books are really about, my humble attempt to inspire others to get better at guitar which I hope will make them feel better about themselves.  You're not just getting a book but a friend who wants you to succeed!    </p>

<p><a href=""http://leapfrogpress.com/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Leapfrog Press</a> is an independent literary publisher
established in 1995. We have a diverse list that includes literary fiction and
middle-grade fiction, as well as some nonfiction and the occasional poetry
collection. Leapfrog is distributed by Consortium Book Sales &amp; Distribution
and sells through all chain, online, and independent retailers, as well as to
libraries and educational markets. </p>
<p>Leapfrog’s mission is to seek out and publish fine literary
works that are often overlooked by the larger presses. Leapfrog chooses its
books based on literary merit rather than potential sales, with book sales
covering approximately 70% of our operating budget. Grant funding and
tax-deductible donations cover the rest. <br/></p>
<p><b>Our Campaign</b><br/></p>
<p>In October, our first young adult novel will be available:
<b><i></i><a href=""http://leapfrogpress.com/available-books/childrens/LoneWolves.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lone Wolves </a>by Native Alaskan author John Smelcer, which the late Ray Bradbury called ""A beautiful and moving story of courage and love.""</b></p>
<p>Lone Wolves is not only Leapfrog’s first YA novel; it is
also our first hardcover book. We are printing simultaneous hardcover and trade
paperback editions, and since this decision was made back in February, we have
received more pre-orders from stores and libraries, of both editions, than our print
budget can cover. With this campaign, we are raising funds to fill the
unanticipated pre-orders and send more copies of this lovely book out into the
world. </p>
<p><b>John Smelcer</b> is the author of more than
forty books. He is an Alaskan Native of the <b>Ahtna tribe</b>, and is now the last
tribal member who reads and writes in Ahtna. In <b><i>Lone Wolves</i></b>, his fourth novel
for teens, John introduces us to 16-year-old Deneena Yazzie, who is not like
other teens in her village. </p>
<p>Lone Wolves is a thoughtful, realistic
portrayal of the struggles of Native Alaskan teens as they feel the pull of
modern culture against that of their families and their heritage, and the
hopelessness to which this can lead. It is also a fine adventure tale, with a
heroine who is in no way stereotypical. </p>

<p><b>Book Description<br/></b></p>
<p>Deneena Yazzie isn’t like
other 16-year-old girls in her village.</p>
<p>Her love of the woods and trail
come from her grandfather, who teaches her their all-but-vanished Native
Alaskan language and customs. While her peers lose hope, trapped between the
old and the modern cultures, and turn to destructive behaviors, Denny and her
mysterious lead dog, a blue-eyed wolf, train for the Great Race—a 1,000-mile
test of courage and endurance through the vast Alaskan wilderness, across
creeks and rivers, mountains and valleys, and the treacherous, frozen Arctic
sea. Some in her village make fun of her, calling her a tomboy, while others
demean her because she is only part Indian and has blue eyes. But Denny learns
the value of intergenerational friendships, of maintaining connections to her
heritage, and of being true to herself, and in her strength she gives her
village new pride and hope.</p>

elements will leave readers wanting to know more about this little-known time
in history.” —<b><i>Booklist</i></b></p>

<h3>Sweet What?</h3>
<p><em>Sweetheart </em>is a collection of erotica for a mature, kink-positive audience. Consisting of 25 vignettes which explore everything from petplay to spankings to threesomes, <em>Sweetheart </em>is an e-book best read with one hand. </p>
<p>With an emphasis on safe, sane and consensual sexual practices, as well as a desire to provide an intelligent, literary perspective, <em>Sweetheart</em> hopes to further the canon of smart, sexy erotica. </p>
<p>Because, let's face it, in a world where the fanfiction of <em>50 Shades of Grey </em>gets a movie deal, perversion has become confused with poor taste.</p>
<p>For those who like numbers: <em>Sweetheart</em> is over 22,000 words and about 83 pages long.</p>
<h3>How <em>Sweetheart</em> Was Born</h3>
<p>Two years ago, I started a blog about kink - my experiences with it, my opinions about it, my fantasies involving it - with the expectation of being able to express myself and connect with a few people. Instead, the blog exploded. What began as an effort to understand aspects of my sexuality through writing became something that other people resonated with in ways I had never anticipated.</p>
<p>Recently, I received several suggestions from followers asking if I would ever seek to publish any of the erotica from my blog. After fielding interest from a larger pool, I realized that producing original content could be an interesting direction to go in. </p>
<p>However, the real push came from, unfortunately, financial need. In August, I will begin graduate school. While I have some financial support from my program, I am otherwise mostly financially independent. But, in order to get to my dream program 500 miles away, I'll need to raise some funds. Although I'm working, producing erotica seemed like a suitable way to put a dent in some of my expenses. Although it initially felt a little like selling out, I soon found that producing <em>Sweetheart</em> was enjoyable and fulfilling.</p>
<p>And, after receiving tons of support and positive feedback from the samples I shared with my followers, I decided <em>Sweetheart</em> and a gig in erotica on the side could be a real thing. So, after some suggestions to crowdfund a little, I've decided to start promoting <em>Sweetheart</em> here and offer the opportunity to preorder the e-book before its August 1 release.</p>

<h2>About Tapestry</h2>
<p>Apache Tapestry is a component-oriented web framework for building fast, scalable and reliable applications from simple and reusable components. Tapestry features concise templates, minimal amounts of Java code, high performance, and important productivity features such as live class reloading and convention over configuration.</p>
<p>Developing Tapestry applications involves creating HTML templates using plain HTML, and combining the templates with small amounts of Java code. Java developers love it because they can make Java code changes and see them immediately ... no redeploy, no restart! And it's blazingly fast to boot. HTML designers love it because Tapestry templates are so close to ordinary HTML.</p>
<p>In Tapestry, you create your application in terms of objects, and the methods and properties of those objects -- and specifically not in terms of URLs and query parameters. Tapestry brings true object oriented development to Java web applications.</p>

time and hope this is something you can get genuinely excited about. This is
the chance to be part of a major project with a published author AND to be a
character in this, my third novel: <i><b>Homeless Horror Story</b></i>.<p></p>
<p><b>First,
some background…</b></p>
<p>I almost hit the big time.</p>
<p>Almost. My first novel, a black comedy called <i><b>3</b></i>, had been published to critical
acclaim in 2004 and ultimately found its way onto the desk of a fabulous London
agent.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/272177/files/20131220192409-a-guy-three-girls-a-jealous-dog.jpg?1387596249"" src="""" style=""width: 271.859px; height: 411px;""/></p>How did it find its way onto his desk? Well, okay, I
sent it to him because I knew he was fabulous. <p></p>
<p>I was living in England at the time (on a working
farm in North Yorkshire to be precise) and he rang to say how much he’d loved the
novel. He asked me to meet him at his Piccadilly Circus office. I said ‘Can I
come now?’ He made some lame excuse about a hundred <i>actual</i> clients who kind of needed his attention first and set up a
meeting for two weeks hence. </p>
<p>I got the train down to London from Northallerton a
day early to ensure I wouldn’t be late and stayed in a hotel five minutes’ walk
from his office to ensure the only public transport I had to rely on was
my legs. </p>
<p>‘I absolutely love <i><b>3</b></i>,’ he said moments into
that meeting before telling me how he had read it over a long weekend in the South of France with friends who had become utterly sick of him laughing out
loud. </p>
<p>‘Here we go!’ I thought. ‘This is it! The
moment every novelist dreams of!’</p>
<p>‘But I can’t sell it.'</p><p>'What?'</p><p>'Undoubtedly it’s one of the funniest books
I’ve ever read, but it’s a very insular, isolated story and very Australian;
I’m just not sure it will resonate with a European market. I want you to write me
something I can sell here. Something set here, but equally funny.’</p>
<p>I stumbled off into Piccadilly Circus wondering if I
could ever take my writing career seriously enough to be funny again.</p>
<p>Two years later I sent him the manuscript for a new
novel called <i><b>Nothing but Animals</b></i>. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/272206/files/20131220195229-NBA.jpg?1387597949"" src="""" style=""width: 254.841px; height: 369px;""/></p>I wrote it in England. I set it there. I made
all but one of the characters English; an Antipodean animal activist trying to
marry into the family of a North Yorkshire battery hen farmer. I made it funny. <br/><p></p><p>As an animal lover I also made it provocative, controversial and thought provoking. I spared no one in the business of exploiting animals on the English landscape: battery hen farmers, sheep and cattle farmers, fox hunters and pheasant shooters. They all copped it. <br/></p><p>But, most importantly as per mission statement, I made it funny.<br/></p>
<p>‘I love it, my soon-to-be London literary agent said. ‘I can sell this.’ </p>
<p>He wasn’t wrong. Transworld Publishers, part of the largest publishing group in Europe, jumped on it, loved it, raved about it. </p>
<p>‘It’s a very funny, extremely well written novel,’ they said.<br/></p>
<p>'Thank you,' we said.<br/></p>
<p>‘But it’s a funny novel with a very serious theme.’</p>
<p>‘Yes!’ we said with enthusiasm.</p><p>'That's actually...a bad thing,' they said.</p><p>'It is?' we said.<br/></p>
<p>‘Well, Ben Elton kind of has the monopoly on
issue-based comedy, and he’s a client.’</p>
<p>‘He is? He does?’ I said.<br/></p>
<p>‘It also gets a bit didactic. Your ALF terrorist is a
sharp character, but very preachy. Can you tone him down a bit?’</p>
<p>I did. </p>
<p>A bit. </p>
<p>But not enough.</p>
<p>They were still scared of the controversial content.
And Ben Elton. My big break became ‘a reluctant pass.’</p>
<p><b>That
was then…</b></p>
<p><b><i>This</i></b><b> is where you come in.</b></p>
<p>If <i><b>Nothing but Animals</b></i> is the world class novel the
world never quite got to see, my new offering, <i><b>Homeless Horror Story</b></i>, promises
to be an even better book; even better than my critically acclaimed first novel <i><b>3</b></i> (currently in development as a 24 episode black comedy television series called
<i><b>Box Freezer</b></i>). </p>
<p>In <i><b>Homeless Horror Story</b></i> I get to revel in my love
for all things Gothic and ghastly, giving the horror genre a hearty kick up the
bum with some deliciously black comedy. It’s a novel set in Australia, but with
a ghostly international flavour. I can’t tell you too much for fear of concept
theft (and we will all know if someone steals this idea - the time stamp is in place), but here’s a tiny synopsis:</p>
<p>Eddie Haverford is a 35 year old homeless
Englishman, widowed and woeful and living in his car along the disparately wonderful beaches
of Australia’s Sunshine Coast while he waits for the courage to start his car
one last time, exhaust connected to a length of discount garden hose (no snap-locks required). But when the ruins of a three hundred year old sandstone inn from a condemned
English village rupture the beachfront grass beneath a Kings Beach children's playground in the dead of night and begin to rise inexorably inch by media-watched inch tumbling earth and swings and slides aside in a grass-growingly slow, yet riveting rise from the bowels of the earth until the entire decayed, derelict building sits ugly, eerie and incongruous before the sparkling apartments of Kings Beach, Eddie Haverford gets out of his car. He has somewhere new to sleep, somewhere so much colder than his sweat box station wagon - so much colder. But as more buildings from that condemned English village begin to rise randomly around South East Queensland and shadowy figures begin to leave long dead houses and head north for the inn on foot, Eddie Haverford's homeless hell of a life is about to take a ghoulish new twist.</p>
<p>I assure you, <i><b>Homeless Horror Story </b></i>will be a
fiendishly funny novel with plenty of shocking twists and turns; I can’t wait
to get stuck in as it has all the ingredients of a best seller! I almost got
that big break once before. All the indicators say that <i>this</i> will be the book that gets me there. But I can’t do it without
your help. 

</p><p><b>What I Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>My goal
is $50,000 which will allow me to write <i><b>Homeless Horror Story</b></i> full time through
2014 and live modestly, but comfortably. While both my previous novels took two
years to write, I do believe that I can write this one in one year; maybe even
less if the bills are covered and I don’t have to take on other writing
projects to make ends meet. </p>

need is the funds to make it happen!</p>

And I’ve had some amazing opportunities.  From booking Anime Guests for I-Con, to Heading the Artist Alley at AnimeNext, and just volunteering at Anime Boston.  Over the years I’ve had a lot of ideas about conventions, how to run panels, how to schedule events, how to manage them, and most of all, that we need more in my neck of the woods. </p><br/><p>And all the time I was thinking, ‘this’.  This is the sort of feeling of belonging that I want to bottle and carry around with me every day.  This community of fans, these people who understand my love, my passion for my fandoms,  and who don’t think it’s just a phase, or immature.  </p><br/><p>Finally, I have been blessed to be surrounded by other awesome people who share my passion for Conventions, and we decided it was time to stop talking about starting our own con and actually do it.</p><br/><p>So here we are, we currently have a wonderful location booked for the August 20th and 21st of this year.  We have booked some awesome guests, and are looking for some more.  We have a ton of interesting events and other activities to do, and more to plan.  And now we are looking for are fellow fans who want to invest in our community and help us build a con that will last. </p><p><br/></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>In order for us to create a convention that will be both financially stable and diverse with fun events and guests we are hoping to raise $20,000 or more.  </p><ul>
<li><p>$10,000 towards securing a second year at our current location, and adding more space for events.</p></li>
<li><p>$5,000 towards equipment, such as Projectors, TV’s and other AV equipment for Panels, Workshops and the Video Game room.</p></li>
<li><p>$3,000 towards bringing in a high profile guest.</p></li>
<li><p>$1,000 towards bringing in more local guests and performers.</p></li>
<li><p>$500 towards expanding staff and covering human resource needs.</p></li>

And I’ve had some amazing opportunities.  From booking Anime Guests for I-Con, to Heading the Artist Alley at AnimeNext, and just volunteering at Anime Boston.  Over the years I’ve had a lot of ideas about conventions, how to run panels, how to schedule events, how to manage them, and most of all, that we need more in my neck of the woods. And all the time I was thinking, ‘this’.  This is the sort of feeling of belonging that I want to bottle and carry around with me every day.  This community of fans, these people who understand my love, my passion for my fandoms,  and who don’t think it’s just a phase, or immature.  Finally, I have been blessed to be surrounded by other awesome people who share my passion for Conventions, and we decided it was time to stop talking about starting our own con and actually do it.So here we are, we currently have a wonderful location booked for the August 20th and 21st of this year.  We have booked some awesome guests, and are looking for some more.  We have a ton of interesting events and other activities to do, and more to plan.  And now we are looking for are fellow fans who want to invest in our community and help us build a con that will last. What We Need & What You GetIn order for us to create a convention that will be both financially stable and diverse with fun events and guests we are hoping to raise $20,000 or more.  
$10,000 towards securing a second year at our current location, and adding more space for events.
$5,000 towards equipment, such as Projectors, TV’s and other AV equipment for Panels, Workshops and the Video Game room.
$3,000 towards bringing in a high profile guest.
$1,000 towards bringing in more local guests and performers.
$500 towards expanding staff and covering human resource needs.
$500 towards miscellaneous expenses and fees for running this campaign.
Any extra funds raised will go towards bringing in more guests and performers, expanding the space at the hotel, and investing in more and better equipment for panels and workshops.  Should we fall short of our goal, the funds will go towards equipment first, then bringing in more guests, then securing a second year with more hotel space.In order to reach our goal, we have created perks that let fellow fans ‘Put Their Name on It’.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My ""World Tour"" of Comic Cons and bookstores in support of <em>Sidekick: The Misadventures of the New Scarlet Knight</em> and its upcoming sequel <em>Brothers in Arms</em> kicks off September 6th at Baltimore Comic-Con, with other dates added as time and funds allow. My hope is to be able to add stops in New York, Chicago, Portland, Louisville, Toronto, and any other con or bookstore that will have me.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Booking these events is expensive. I will need to pay for tables at cons. I will need promotional materials. I will need copies of the book (and eventually both books) to sell at the events. I will need gas money to get me to each event.</p>
<p>My current goal will cover my most immediate needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying for my table at Baltimore Comic-Con, where I'm launching the tour.</li>
<li>Laying in a sufficient stock of copies of <em>Sidekick</em> to autograph and sell during the tour.</li>
<li>Designing and printing special promotional materials. I would really like to be able to have a giveaway mini-comic ""prequel"" to <em>Sidekick, </em>and the cost of a print run and paying the artist for the work is included in my goal.</li>
<li>Should I be accepted, paying for my table at New York Comic Con in October.</li>
<li>Any remaining funds would go toward funding additional dates on the tour.</li>
</ul>
<p>To make it worth your while, I'm going to offer some keepsakes from the tour, autographed books, a shot at immortality, and even the shirt off my back!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Funding this tour will give me a chance to get out there and promote these books. Sadly, it's hard for small presses to compete nowadays and even harder for relatively unknown authors to get their books noticed. This tour will help me get my books in front of my target audience.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Keep spreading the word! Let people know about this project and the book! And if you can lay your hands on a copy, read it!</p>

<p>It's about raising funds to publish Lexus Sam -- a fast-paced story that reads like a film noir on the printed page. This story is for anyone who likes suspense, mystery, and stories that are off the beaten path, and I hope you’ll consider contributing to its success.</p>
<div>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>What's the Novel About?</strong></h2>
<p>It is about a man who calls himself Lexus Sam. He doesn't know his real name or where he came from. He lives in a Manhattan apartment but he only remembers ever living in California. In a bungalow on the beach.</p>
<p>The apartment is rented out to someone named Adam Williams, who the landlord insists is Lexus. He has Adam's wallet, too; the picture on the driver's license inside looks like him. But Lexus thinks it's a fake, a prop, because he knows he's not him. That's not his life.</p>
<p>His life is back in California with Sarah. He only remembers a few details about her but he's sure they were together -- in love and happy. That's his life.</p>
<p>He just has to prove it.</p>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Can I read some of it?</strong></h2>
<p>Sure. Here's an excerpt:</p>
<p><em>The blowing snow cut across his path in a downward slant, drawing stinging lines of white over the empty plain.  A path of footprints, little craters in the sheet covering the hard ground, trailed away in a gently curving arc over the horizon — each print a signpost pointing the way to his girl with green eyes.  But the drifting, falling snow filled them in bit by bit and unless he caught up soon, it’d cover her tracks forever.</em></p>
<p><em>He pulled his scarf up over his mouth against the blowing snow and stepped off the road.  He matched her stride step for step, walking in her footprints.</em></p>
<p><em>Something caught his eye and–</em></p>
<p><em>–the scene burned away.  The plain of blowing snow became tangled sheets of green snaked around a twisted, sprawled form in bed.</em></p>
<p><em>He raised his head off the pillow and sat up, propped on his elbows, and stared.  Stared straight ahead, past his physical sight and through to the fading dream, those footprints in the snow.</em></p>

<h2 style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Who is the Author?</strong></h2>
<p>I was born and raised in the suburbs of Toronto and began writing at an early age. <br/>The first time my name appeared in print was back when I was in Kindergarten. I wrote a (very) short story called The Little Big Feet for a school-wide creative writing contest. Amazingly, my story won and was selected to represent my school in the anthology. <br/>I was hooked after that and have been writing and telling stories ever since. <br/>Although I move around a lot, right now I live in MidTown Toronto with my (soon-to-be) wife Jillian Rose and our extra fluffy tuxedo cat Errol.</p>

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p><strong>Terra incognita</strong>, más que novela histórica, es una historia que refleja pensamientos y sentimientos medievales y su choque inevitable con el Renacimiento y la fiebre de descubrimientos y conquistas que marcaron el inicio del siglo XVI. ¿<i>Qué</i> es Gonzalo Guerrero? es la pregunta central de esta novela, que no deja respiro al lector una vez la comienza.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Corre el año 1511. Tras un violento naufragio en el mar de las Antillas, un viejo bote arrastra a los primeros hispanos a lo que hoy es la península de Yucatán, México. Cuando se encuentra con el mundo maya, Gonzalo Guerrero tiene que tomar la difícil decisión de adaptarse y sobrevivir lo mejor posible para llegar a formar una familia y comandar los ejércitos mayas en contra de sus propios compatriotas. Los recuerdos de Guerrero se borran en la arena de los tiempos. Su vida y obra permanecen ocultas bajo el velo del misterio y el olvido de conquistadores, frailes y cronistas. ¿Fue realmente un traidor a Castilla, un hereje, un apóstata? Hernán Cortés afirmó categóricamente que «jamás sería bueno» y el adelantado Francisco de Montejo le instó a «apartar al diablo de su corazón». ¿Quién era Gonzalo Guerrero, entonces?</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">La novela cuenta con el apoyo del máximo teórico del personaje, el Dr. Salvador Campos Jara, cuyo prólogo se podrá encontrar en el libro, y la portada quedará a cargo del muralista Otoniel Baruck Sala, artista de talla internacional y cuyo ejemplo podemos ver en la parte superior.</p>
<h3>¿Quiénes?</h3>

Al punto recordó Huelva, la tierra suave que recibía la caricia de los veranos tibios, la tierra de los inviernos que tiznaban de blanco brillante las sierras de Andalucía, aquellas colinas de sus recorridos y travesuras en una infancia nebulosa.<br/>       Sin embargo, siempre sucedía lo mismo cuando recordaba su niñez: la pesadilla aleteaba como un cuervo apenas cerraba los ojos; empantanaba las visiones de su niñez, y convertía Huelva en un ser sin forma ni sentimientos, como los indios que se revolvían feroces en las batallas bajo el lacerante sol y el picor de los insectos. Era una pesadilla que siempre empezaba con sus manos, de palmas blancas y pequeñas, de un niño que intentaba aferrarse a una cruz empapada de sangre. De las nieblas surgían más cruces negras, y un rostro cadavérico levantaba su índice contra él.<br/>       Terribles estertores, hogueras y cruces se degustaban en el trago amargo del agua salada mezclada con la dulce de los pellejos; sabía que estas tierras estériles no pertenecían a la absolución del Altísimo. Duerme, Gonzalo, duerme<i>,</i> susurraba, gritaba sin una voz saliendo del pecho tatuado de ronchas y cicatrices; ni su respiración provocaba la mínima arruga en el agua estancada.

You've enjoyed the local spin we provide on everything health and fitness related in the Edmonton area. Now it's time to grow. </p>
<p>YEG Fitness has been the source for health and fitness related content connecting readers with local businesses that provide great products and services. We're not going to be changing that. We're just going to make the experience better. </p>
<p>We've listened to our readers over the past 12 months and now it's time to act. Many of you enjoy the digital format of the magazine for it's ease of use and option to be able to take it with you on your smart phone or tablet. But many of our readers mentioned that they still like the feel of holding a magazine in their hands. It's time to act on that request. </p>
<p>By contributing to our campaign, you will be helping us launch our first print edition in time for a January launch. We have lofty goals to get YEG Fitness into studios, apparel and nutrition stores and therapist offices to continue to showcase all that is wellness in Edmonton. Your funds will be used to help offset costs of creating a print source. Digital is inexpensive to create other than the time invested in the design. Print has higher overhead. </p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We will be using the funds obtained in this campaign to help develop the first edition so that we can use the advertising revenue from the first edition to support the development of the next edition. We hope to launch our first print edition with 2500 copies which has a cost of just over $5000. </p>
<p>We have spent the past four months researching different print options and will be creating a high quality magazine using a local printer. We believe in supporting the local community and while we could have sourced the magazine overseas for a lower cost, we want to continue making this a locally developed project. </p>
<p>In addition to the Indiegogo campaign, we will be hosting a launch party to celebrate the first edition. Funds from this event will be used to develop future editions of the magazine. </p>
<p>We've created a number of great connections in the fitness and wellness communities over the past three years and have secured some great PERKS for contributors.

</div></div>","Short Summary You've been following us on social media for nearly 3 years and read our digital magazine for the past 12 months. You've enjoyed the local spin we provide on everything health and fitness related in the Edmonton area. Now it's time to grow. 
YEG Fitness has been the source for health and fitness related content connecting readers with local businesses that provide great products and services. We're not going to be changing that. We're just going to make the experience better. 
We've listened to our readers over the past 12 months and now it's time to act. Many of you enjoy the digital format of the magazine for it's ease of use and option to be able to take it with you on your smart phone or tablet. But many of our readers mentioned that they still like the feel of holding a magazine in their hands. It's time to act on that request. 
By contributing to our campaign, you will be helping us launch our first print edition in time for a January launch. We have lofty goals to get YEG Fitness into studios, apparel and nutrition stores and therapist offices to continue to showcase all that is wellness in Edmonton. Your funds will be used to help offset costs of creating a print source. Digital is inexpensive to create other than the time invested in the design. Print has higher overhead. 
   What We Need & What You Get We will be using the funds obtained in this campaign to help develop the first edition so that we can use the advertising revenue from the first edition to support the development of the next edition. We hope to launch our first print edition with 2500 copies which has a cost of just over $5000. 
We have spent the past four months researching different print options and will be creating a high quality magazine using a local printer. We believe in supporting the local community and while we could have sourced the magazine overseas for a lower cost, we want to continue making this a locally developed project. 
In addition to the Indiegogo campaign, we will be hosting a launch party to celebrate the first edition. Funds from this event will be used to develop future editions of the magazine. 
We've created a number of great connections in the fitness and wellness communities over the past three years and have secured some great PERKS for contributors. Fitness passes, apparel, and nutrition products and services are just some of the PERKS available. For business owners, we're also offering some discounted pricing on our ad rates as a thank you for helping us launch this next stage of YEG Fitness. 
We've set a modest goal of $5000 for this campaign. The more we raise, the better the product and the greater reach we will have. If we raise over the $5000, we will print and distribute more magazines to expand our reach. If we receive less (which hopefully doesn't happen), we have a plan that will still allow us to release the January edition using the funds collected. 

    The Impact By supporting this project, you will be allowing us to reach more Edmontonians to show them how to lead a healthier lifestyle and some of the local businesses that they can use to achieve their own form of personal wellness.

""Cos’è, per voi, l’orrore?
Demoni? Mostri deformi? Sangue che fuoriesce a fiotti da una ferita?
Vi basta così poco per tremare?
O forse… pensateci bene… forse è quel brivido che sentite quando vi fermate a osservare un incidente, allungando lo sguardo in cerca di un possibile cadavere. O magari è l’ipocrisia nascosta dentro una vecchia, lurida bugia. Oppure – ecco, forse ci siamo – sta nei vostri occhi, voltati dall’altra parte di fronte a una nefandezza, nel vostro far finta di niente.
Tanto poi passa, vi dite.
Ma, attenzione, niente passa senza lasciare tracce.
I SEGRETI DELLA SCOGLIERA parla proprio di questo, di te che leggi e di me che scrivo, del marcio che abbiamo dentro tutti, che condiziona le nostre azioni e reazioni e ci trasforma in animali capaci di fare del male, o che ci rende conniventi grazie all’aiuto del silenzio.
È facile il silenzio, è comodo… solo che rischia, alla lunga, di turbare i sonni tranquilli di chiunque.
Ed è una particolare forma di silenzio, creativo, quello che cerca il protagonista del romanzo, Giuseppe Scrimieri, scrittore di successo, quando decide di acquistare una casa a Torre Del Fiume, paesino del Salento arroccato sulla scogliera, in cui aveva trascorso le sue estati fin da bambino.
 
Proprio a quel piccolo angolo di paradiso Giuseppe deve il suo grande successo, essendosi ispirato a luoghi e personaggi del posto per dar vita al suo primo best-seller Il Villaggio Dell’Orrore.
Il libro era stato un caso letterario, ma oltre alla fama gli aveva portato fin troppi guai, e quello che poteva sembrare il semplice esordio di uno scrittore di belle speranze aveva scatenato l’ira degli abitanti del paese, colti nel vivo, in quell’anima nera che era rimasta nascosta al mondo esterno per così tanto tempo.
Di questo Giuseppe Scrimieri è consapevole, ma pensa sia tutto finito alle spalle ormai, cicatrizzato in qualche ricordo spiacevole, qualche insinuazione di troppo, qualche turista curioso. Ciò che lo scrittore ignora, è che il suo ritorno risveglierà quel male oscuro, mai del tutto sopito, pronto a cibarsi ancora di sangue e follia.
Nadia e Guendalina Mele, Maria Cipressi e Pasquale Vivaldi, Giovanni e Aldo Scarcia, personaggi a tutto tondo, descritti e animati con mano sapiente, saranno i figuranti di un dramma così mostruoso proprio perché autentico, universale, tanto che il vortice in cui verrà risucchiato Giuseppe diventerà il baratro nel quale tutti rischiamo di precipitare.
Perché il mostro è in ognuno di noi, pronto ad attaccare, disposto a negare fino alla fine, capace di mentire e di cambiare maschera continuamente, per semplice sopravvivenza.
Facendo sua la crudezza e l’efficacia dei maestri del brivido, da Poe a Lovecraft, passando per Stephen King, Marco Esposito confeziona un thrilling diretto e tagliente, con sfumature horror, capace di sedurvi pagina dopo pagina, fino a travolgervi nel crescendo finale, in cui il ritmo incalzante e i colpi di scena vi lasceranno senza fiato.""

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Necropolis Press is a small publishing company.  We formed in January 2011 wth a few hundred dollars and a dream.  Our staff consists of two college professors and graphic designer.  Our backgrounds are in history, psychology, and literature, with several publishing credits.  We do not get salaries for our work.  The only compensation allotted to our contributors comes from book sales.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Our primary goal is to produce inexpensive titles in our ""Classroom Classics"" series: works of classic literature (especially genre fiction - sci-fi, fantasy, horror, mystery, thriller, suspense, supernatural, etc.) for use in both the classroom and the living room.  Our secondary goal is to locate and publish fresh works of genre fiction by new and emerging writers.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Our Classroom Classics include new introductions, explanatory footnotes, study guide questions, and - utilizing the talents of new and emerging artists - custom cover art.  The volumes are easy to read, informative, educational, and attractive.  For teachers looking for something different in the classroom - for readers who always meant to read ""that book"" but have not.  We want these titles preserved and read, as inexpensively as possible. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We all know how expensive textbooks have become.  At the same time, genre fiction is often ignored as a useful supplement in high school and college classrooms.  Our Classroom Classics series seeks to address both of these issues, publishing sturdy, attractive, but inexpensive volumes, with extra information and study guide questions for application in English, History, and other appropriate courses.  We keep our prices as low as possible (usually between $8-$15, depending on page count), while still compensating contributors.  By keeping our overhead low, we can keep our costs low, thus making our publications attractive to a wider audience. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are trying to raise $1000.  This amount will cover the administration costs for more than a dozen Classroom Classics titles, freeing up money from sales to compensate our contributors and search for new writers to publish.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We produce four volumes in the Classroom Classics every six months (June / Dec).  For example, in June 2011, we published:</p>
<p>1) ""Dracula"" - Bram Stoker</p>
<p>2) ""War of the Worlds"" - H.G. Wells</p>
<p>3) ""A Picture of Dorian Grey"" - Oscar Wilde</p>
<p>4) ""The Thing from the Lake"" - Eleanor Ingram.</p>
<p>We also published the 2nd Edition of original novel ""A Life in Chiaroscuro"" by author Paul-Thomas Ferguson.<br/></p>
<p>You can look inside these volumes at Amazon.com if you would like to see the work we are doing.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Achieving our fundraising goal would allow us to cover administrative costs at least through the end of 2012, for a minimum of 12 new Classroom Classics.  Titles slated for publication in December 2011 are:</p>
<p>1) ""The Geneva Collection - Frankenstein / The Vampyre / and Fragments (Mary Shelley, John Polidori, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron)""</p>
<p>2) ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" - Jules Verne</p>
<p>3) ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue and other Mysteries"" - Edgar Allan Poe</p>
<p>4) ""The House on the Borderland"" - William Hope Hodgson</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>June 2012 titles are still under review, but will continue along the same vein.  If we do not reach our entire goal, we will produce as many volumes as we can and supplement our funds with future fundraising efforts.  Every dime donated goes toward administrative costs (and whatever incentives your donation trigger.)  <br/></p>

<p>A term often heard, but how often can we point to incidences of it actually happening. Now comes the opportunity to be involved in a literary project that has a ‘shot’ at having a tangible, grass-roots impact in real-life.</p>
<p>The novel at the heart of this, The Second Amendment, is already mostly finished. Copies are already available on Amazon Kindle as an e-book (so you can partly check out this project in advance) – so what will the funds be used for?</p>
<p>The book has already gone through two edit phases. There’ll be a final edit phase, plus getting The Second Amendment produced as both a trade paperback and hardback. Those ‘final edit’ editions will also include the names (in an acknowledgement section at the back) of all the people who have helped take this project to the ‘next level’ – which means YOU (picture Lord Kitchener pointing to you from a poster).</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The Next Level</strong></h2>
<p>At the core of the plot in ‘The Second Amendment’ is a thesis which could have impact in real life on the way gun control is viewed in the USA. In the book, the far-right want to ensure it doesn’t come to fruition. The battle lines are drawn and a hard-edged conflict ensues. </p>
<p>Now that thesis was based on my own research at the time of what might work in real life. Using my experience and contacts as a past political magazine editor and novelist, I was in touch with numerous gun control supporters: Congressmen, Senators and Brady Campaign supporters (including veteran actor Paul Newman three years before his death, a keen gun control advocate). Many were supportive, and out of that a thesis gained shape.</p>
<p>But that thesis is still in raw, embryonic form. Only so much detail was needed for it to play a part in a thriller, and the main research was done some ten years ago. It needs updating, fleshing out and shaping as a final document that could actually work in practice. This will entail exhaustive further research amongst gun-control support groups, political leaders and lobbyists. Hard facts and figures will be required to back up the thesis/proposal.</p>
<p>Most importantly, once completed, it will be sent to Congressmen, Senators, lobbyists and support groups who might actually be able to guide that thesis/proposal towards implementation in real life. Therefore transforming an initial art/literary project into one which could have real grass roots impact on future gun control legislation. And that final thesis, as with the last edit of book, The Second Amendment’, will also include the names of all those who’ve offered their support in taking the project to that ‘next level’ (again, YOU). This is what the majority of funding will go towards.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>A brief history lesson  </strong></h2>
<p>The problem with gun control is that it’s written in the Constitution as a core right of the people, straight after The First Amendment on free speech. Now the reasons for that are perfectly understandable: without guns in the American War of Independence, Americans might still be sipping tea or have a picture of the British Queen above their fireplaces. Of course, the Brits, being polite and accommodating, also had their soldiers wear bright red uniforms so that they were easy to pick off.</p>
<p>But the actual wording of the Second Amendment (possibly in light of that history), didn’t simply give leave for all Americans to carry arms on a loose, general basis. It was tied specifically to militia and national defence, as follows: ‘<em>A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a </em><em>free state</em><em>, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed</em>.’</p>
<p>Now unfortunately that isn’t what has happened in the evolution of gun distribution and/or limited control. ‘Some’ sections of US society are reasonably regulated and trained and could be seen as a valuable militia to support national defence; but the vast majority are not, and ‘Saturday night specials’ can come out for anything from fender benders to a neighbour playing their radio too loud.</p>
<p>So this made me look towards a nation that does have a proliferation of guns specifically for the purpose of national defence: Switzerland. Partly as a result of its neutrality, Switzerland historically (until a partial reduction in 2004) has had an ‘on call’ private militia army constituting almost 30% of all eligible Swiss males between the age of 18-50, making it pro-rata the second largest reservist army in the world (after Israel). In the USA this would equate to an on call reservist army of almost 20 million, six times its current size (standing army and reservists).</p>
<p>However, 90% of the weapons of this Swiss ‘on call’ militia army are held in the private homes of militia members (generally in secure, locked cupboards). Furthermore, upon induction militia members are trained in the use of those weapons and have regular refresher courses. But despite such a proliferation of weapons in private homes, incidences of these weapons being used against their fellow Swiss are practically unheard of. Would this then better represent the ethos of what the original Constitution drafters had in mind when they linked arms to ‘militia’ in The Second Amendment? And, more to the point, could such a system possibly work in practical terms in the USA?</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>
<strong>Shaping the proposal for today’s </strong><strong>USA</strong><strong>?</strong>
</h2>
<p>The Swiss model has many merits which would transpose well to the USA: the locked cupboard or casing would deter casual shootings; it should also prevent guns being fired by accident, as in the case of children, an increasing hot-button area of concern. The induction and training, apart from aiding a militia to be more efficient, should also help people be more responsible with the use of firearms. Driving a car requires passing a rigid test, so why not guns as well?</p>
<p>But in order to satisfy The Second Amendment, those arms (in a locked case at home, with initial induction training) should be available to <em>all</em> Americans upon request. Guns would not be allowed to be carried freely on the street (which follows more the Canadian model and is the law in a number of US states). Those uncomfortable about having a gun at home could nominate a local neighbourhood warden to carry their gun for them. A local warden could also be an option for the carrying of automatic weapons.   </p>
<p>The initial thesis in The Second Amendment added an extra twist to that home gun case; a glass front, similar to fire alarms, with the sticker: ‘<em>Only to be smashed in the case of national emergency</em>’. The only other allowable incidence would be if there was a cogent threat (an intruder or burglar). The act of smashing the case would then ring an alarm in the local police station. Handy, being able to call reinforcements for that intruder, but not so handy if your aim was to shoot your neighbour; all things being equal, the police should arrive while the gun was still smoking (or in an ideal world, <em>before</em> you’d fired – but let’s not get too carried away here about police efficiency :)</p>
<p>A pin-numbered case would be another option. Also, in the age of GPS, an alarm if that gun case was moved from the house. These are all elements the final thesis would investigate and expound upon.</p>
<p>The other key element the final thesis would study is that of amnesty. An enormous number of guns are already in circulation in the USA, so perhaps some sort of trade off between those weapons and the newly ‘allowable’ weapons to be held in a case at home? Also, what sort of time scale would be workable for such an amnesty to take effect? What restrictions and penalties would then be placed on the weapons that fell outside of the new regulations?</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Main aim and pricing structure</strong></h2>
<p>The main aim is to get as many support names as possible for the final thesis proposal to be presented to the powers that be. Fifty or so names probably wouldn’t make much of an impact, but several hundred or a thousand (or more) would. So I’ll be pricing this lean and mean and offering exceptional value for money.</p>
<p>So as a high-volume-name and low-price exercise, I won’t be adding fridge magnets, posters or Second Amendment T-shirts and bathrobes to inflate the upper-level packages. Besides which, wearing the latter within telescopic range of GOA or NRA members might get you shot :)</p>
<p>It will just be the plain book in its different formats and the final thesis, with your name added with thanks in both. So that for the price of the average Grisham or Clancy novel (far less in e-book format), you can be a part of a unique ‘life mirroring art’ project and have your name included in the roster of those who actually tried to make a difference.  </p>

But that thesis is still in raw, embryonic form. Only so much detail was needed for it to play a part in a thriller, and the main research was done some ten years ago. It needs updating, fleshing out and shaping as a final document that could actually work in practice. This will entail exhaustive further research amongst gun-control support groups, political leaders and lobbyists. Hard facts and figures will be required to back up the thesis/proposal.
Most importantly, once completed, it will be sent to Congressmen, Senators, lobbyists and support groups who might actually be able to guide that thesis/proposal towards implementation in real life. Therefore transforming an initial art/literary project into one which could have real grass roots impact on future gun control legislation. And that final thesis, as with the last edit of book, The Second Amendment’, will also include the names of all those who’ve offered their support in taking the project to that ‘next level’ (again, YOU). This is what the majority of funding will go towards.
 
A brief history lesson  
The problem with gun control is that it’s written in the Constitution as a core right of the people, straight after The First Amendment on free speech. Now the reasons for that are perfectly understandable: without guns in the American War of Independence, Americans might still be sipping tea or have a picture of the British Queen above their fireplaces. Of course, the Brits, being polite and accommodating, also had their soldiers wear bright red uniforms so that they were easy to pick off.
But the actual wording of the Second Amendment (possibly in light of that history), didn’t simply give leave for all Americans to carry arms on a loose, general basis. It was tied specifically to militia and national defence, as follows: ‘A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.’
Now unfortunately that isn’t what has happened in the evolution of gun distribution and/or limited control. ‘Some’ sections of US society are reasonably regulated and trained and could be seen as a valuable militia to support national defence; but the vast majority are not, and ‘Saturday night specials’ can come out for anything from fender benders to a neighbour playing their radio too loud.
So this made me look towards a nation that does have a proliferation of guns specifically for the purpose of national defence: Switzerland. Partly as a result of its neutrality, Switzerland historically (until a partial reduction in 2004) has had an ‘on call’ private militia army constituting almost 30% of all eligible Swiss males between the age of 18-50, making it pro-rata the second largest reservist army in the world (after Israel). In the USA this would equate to an on call reservist army of almost 20 million, six times its current size (standing army and reservists).
However, 90% of the weapons of this Swiss ‘on call’ militia army are held in the private homes of militia members (generally in secure, locked cupboards). Furthermore, upon induction militia members are trained in the use of those weapons and have regular refresher courses. But despite such a proliferation of weapons in private homes, incidences of these weapons being used against their fellow Swiss are practically unheard of. Would this then better represent the ethos of what the original Constitution drafters had in mind when they linked arms to ‘militia’ in The Second Amendment? And, more to the point, could such a system possibly work in practical terms in the USA?
 

Shaping the proposal for today’s USA?

The Swiss model has many merits which would transpose well to the USA: the locked cupboard or casing would deter casual shootings; it should also prevent guns being fired by accident, as in the case of children, an increasing hot-button area of concern. The induction and training, apart from aiding a militia to be more efficient, should also help people be more responsible with the use of firearms. Driving a car requires passing a rigid test, so why not guns as well?
But in order to satisfy The Second Amendment, those arms (in a locked case at home, with initial induction training) should be available to all Americans upon request. Guns would not be allowed to be carried freely on the street (which follows more the Canadian model and is the law in a number of US states). Those uncomfortable about having a gun at home could nominate a local neighbourhood warden to carry their gun for them. A local warden could also be an option for the carrying of automatic weapons.   
The initial thesis in The Second Amendment added an extra twist to that home gun case; a glass front, similar to fire alarms, with the sticker: ‘Only to be smashed in the case of national emergency’. The only other allowable incidence would be if there was a cogent threat (an intruder or burglar). The act of smashing the case would then ring an alarm in the local police station. Handy, being able to call reinforcements for that intruder, but not so handy if your aim was to shoot your neighbour; all things being equal, the police should arrive while the gun was still smoking (or in an ideal world, before you’d fired – but let’s not get too carried away here about police efficiency :)
A pin-numbered case would be another option. Also, in the age of GPS, an alarm if that gun case was moved from the house. These are all elements the final thesis would investigate and expound upon.
The other key element the final thesis would study is that of amnesty. An enormous number of guns are already in circulation in the USA, so perhaps some sort of trade off between those weapons and the newly ‘allowable’ weapons to be held in a case at home? Also, what sort of time scale would be workable for such an amnesty to take effect? What restrictions and penalties would then be placed on the weapons that fell outside of the new regulations?
 
Main aim and pricing structure
The main aim is to get as many support names as possible for the final thesis proposal to be presented to the powers that be. Fifty or so names probably wouldn’t make much of an impact, but several hundred or a thousand (or more) would. So I’ll be pricing this lean and mean and offering exceptional value for money.
So as a high-volume-name and low-price exercise, I won’t be adding fridge magnets, posters or Second Amendment T-shirts and bathrobes to inflate the upper-level packages. Besides which, wearing the latter within telescopic range of GOA or NRA members might get you shot :)
It will just be the plain book in its different formats and the final thesis, with your name added with thanks in both. So that for the price of the average Grisham or Clancy novel (far less in e-book format), you can be a part of a unique ‘life mirroring art’ project and have your name included in the roster of those who actually tried to make a difference.

<p>Flasher in training
Jason Crawford has dedicated his life to fighting the mysterious
alien race which threatens the massive city-ship he calls home. Just weeks away from graduation, however, Jason discovers a terrible
secret which could mean an end to his way of life forever. Fearing
government reprisal for this newfound knowledge, Jason takes refuge
in the Rim, a walled-off section of the ship where citizens are left
to fend for themselves while the government ruthlessly plunders its
resources.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>While
there, Jason forms an uneasy alliance with fellow exile Greg. Though
they share the same goal of exposing the government's terrible
secret, their relationship is strained; Jason is selfish, profane and
morally ambiguous, while Greg is generous, kind and liberal-minded.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Will Jason and Greg
manage to achieve their goals despite their ideological differences?
Will Jason ever escape the Rim, and if so, can he hope to regain
anything even resembling the life of entitlement to which he was
accustomed?</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>""I Dreamt of Trees"" is
a story of struggle and survival in a dystopian society built on fear
and greed, where no
one is quite as good, nor quite as bad as they seem.</p>

<p>I'm an author with a degree in Art and Education and a qualified guidance counsellor specialist. I've had a rewarding career for over 35 years in many art related fields from a television art director, University art instructor, designer and freelance radio Art talk show host, but always been an artist. I was told I had a pencil in hand at age two.   </p>

<p>I would like to
relate back my experiences in this new book that will be helpful to creative people with anxiety related issues. The book shares my knowledge and experiences with motivating ideas to focus on the ups and those downs in an arts career. There  are some interviews by well known artists and how they dealt with their anxieties. Anxiety still has false assumptions by the public. The focus here in on strategies you can use to help your angst diminish; regain your love of creating art. My state wasn't uncommon.</p>

Lucky to stumble out of totalled new and well built VW, which insurance replaced. I got PTSD, two neck discs compressed. I became disinterested in more things, rather distressed and restless. I also had memory lapses and off and on depression. Treatment as pain relief medication and chiropractic therapy and more. It dragged on as I had to take funds from my Investments, which I should never have had to. My lawyer took care of that.</p>

</div></div>","Intro to my Book Project:    
I'm an author with a degree in Art and Education and a qualified guidance counsellor specialist. I've had a rewarding career for over 35 years in many art related fields from a television art director, University art instructor, designer and freelance radio Art talk show host, but always been an artist. I was told I had a pencil in hand at age two.   


I would like to
relate back my experiences in this new book that will be helpful to creative people with anxiety related issues. The book shares my knowledge and experiences with motivating ideas to focus on the ups and those downs in an arts career. There  are some interviews by well known artists and how they dealt with their anxieties. Anxiety still has false assumptions by the public. The focus here in on strategies you can use to help your angst diminish; regain your love of creating art. My state wasn't uncommon.

As an artist, have you ever lost interest in the
thing you love doing the most? Have
you ever looked at a large white paper and all it did was bring on anxiety. It's happened to me! 


I suddenly lost interest in creating watercolours several years ago, which was a passion for along time, and what occurred after was rather profound.  
Added to my state of being I was in a car accident not long after. I was hit by a car going through a red light. Lucky to stumble out of totalled new and well built VW, which insurance replaced. I got PTSD, two neck discs compressed. I became disinterested in more things, rather distressed and restless. I also had memory lapses and off and on depression. Treatment as pain relief medication and chiropractic therapy and more. It dragged on as I had to take funds from my Investments, which I should never have had to. My lawyer took care of that.

This incident set me back, not able to teach,
lack of focus and multi-tasking was not to be. My mind and body lost its old
schedule, and needed renewal and did. Soon something began to click and was creating with a new mixed media.
My art website of new artwork at:  http://artistprints.ca
One thing that helped was my doctor advising me to get away from the stressors in my environment. So I went to Toronto and Miami 4 months after. It was an amazing change; more inspiring state, also with less pain. I brought my art portfolio, did some prior planning and sold art. Great!
Back at my home studio, I began scanning prior art & photographs into my computer, manipulating them into new creations using appropriate applications. That was therapeutic, back into the love
of creating in a new way. Yoga and regular exercise was helpful and meditation. 

What Purpose
Does this Book Have.
There are so many creative people that I have read about that have lost their
creative urge, not on the same happy path as before. I hope this book will help
to bring out that Artist within you, as I convey my experiences, with writings, advice from doctors, psychologists to artists' interviews of their issues, in collaboration. 

This book called 'ANXIETY AND THE ARTIST WITHIN' is more about Art as therapy to re-inspire your inner creative self which has been stuck in some void psychologically as anxiety to depression. It is keeping  you from moving ahead being off a schedule. It could be the fear of failure. For me things often became overwhelming. If you have had a love of creating art then it can surely be rekindled again. That's what my book is about- To help you confront those blocks, get ahead.



Does this art bring on an emotive feeling? 'Distant Island' can relate back to the viewer a feeling of loneliness to sadness. My art confronts my 'separation anxiety'.
What We Need & What You Get The funding needed is $5500.

pants for business suits at the World Aid Corps (WAC) headquarters in
Washington, D.C. Her first major assignment, planning a new corporate-funded
project in a rural village in Cambodia, seems simple enough—at first. Before
long, she is caught in a web of high-stakes (for the aid world) board room
deals, conflicting priorities, and hidden agendas that threatens not only to
rob her of her career, but devour her soul.</i></p>
<p><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">From the iridescent rice fields of the Mekong Delta, to the
curiously named bars and teeming backstreets of Phnom Penh, Mary-Anne finds her
journey inextricably tied to others: a bereaved Cambodian mother, an arrogant
colleague with something to prove, and a demanding donor with something to gain.
As she searches for the sweet spot between humanitarian idealism and donors’
expectations, will she be able to do what she knows in her heart is  right? Whose version of “helping” really
helps? And in end, will she embrace the code of honor among humanitarians and
thieves?</i></p>

""Mary-Anne has left East Africa and traded in her dusty cargo
pants for business suits at the World Aid Corps (WAC) headquarters in
Washington, D.C. Her first major assignment, planning a new corporate-funded
project in a rural village in Cambodia, seems simple enough—at first. Before
long, she is caught in a web of high-stakes (for the aid world) board room
deals, conflicting priorities, and hidden agendas that threatens not only to
rob her of her career, but devour her soul.
From the iridescent rice fields of the Mekong Delta, to the
curiously named bars and teeming backstreets of Phnom Penh, Mary-Anne finds her
journey inextricably tied to others: a bereaved Cambodian mother, an arrogant
colleague with something to prove, and a demanding donor with something to gain.
As she searches for the sweet spot between humanitarian idealism and donors’
expectations, will she be able to do what she knows in her heart is  right? Whose version of “helping” really
helps? And in end, will she embrace the code of honor among humanitarians and
thieves?

Veteran aid worker, blogger, and indie author J.   is weeks away from releasing book #2 in the Mary-Anne humanitarian fiction trilogy and sequel to the ground-breaking 2013 release, Missionary, Mercenary, Mystic, Misfit.
The manuscript is already written (currently at 97,000+ words) and will absolutely be published in early 2015. It just needs a little professional help to get ready.  Contributions to this campaign will go toward that getting ready process, and help make the eventual released version of Honor Among Thieves as good as it can possible be!  What We Need & What You Get Want to know more? Here's your support will be used, and what you get. 

Contributions to this campaign/project will all go toward professional editorial assistance. J.'s last three books have been edited pro bono by a small team of editoresses (they slap J.'s manuscript around and he likes it). It's been awesome of them to help J. out for free, but we think they deserve to get paid something. Every last dime of your contribution goes to the editoresses, regardless of the total amount raised.

 The Evil Genius Publishing reward system:

$10 or more gets you mentioned by name on the ""Special Thanks"" page of the published version (both ebook and print), plus a free ebook (PDF).

$50 or more gets you mentioned by name on the ""Special Thanks"" page of the published version (both ebook and print), plus a first edition printed copy. 
$100 or more gets you mentioned by name on the ""Special Thanks"" page of the published version (both ebook and print), plus a first edition printed copy, signed by the author.

$500 or more gets you mentioned by name on the ""Special Thanks"" page of the published version (both ebook and print), a first edition printed copy signed by the author, and the author will name a character in the story after you. 
  The Impact By contributing to this campaign/project, you're directly making the world better in three ways: 
You're helping to further establish Evil Genius Publishing, a tiny indie publisher that focuses on the humanitarian industry: books by, for, and about aid workers. This will be Evil Genius' fourth unique publication. Every little bit of experience we get makes us all that much better. You're contributing to the amount of writing and literature out there specifically for and about the humanitarian aid industry... that isn't dry, boring, pretentious, technocratic, academic drudgery. The medical field has Dean Koontz and Grey's Anatomy; the spy world has Robert Ludlum. But what do the aid world have? (Please, not Angelina Jolie or Ben Affleck.) Make the world better: support Evil Genius. You're helping up to three aspiring editoresses gain real world experience. Writing is hard, and editing is harder. The world needs more of both. Be part of the solution. 
  Risks & Challenges  As we said above, the manuscript for this book has already been written: Honor Among Thieves will absolutely be published. It's just a matter of time, and a matter of what the final, published version will look like. Some of the primary challenges in releasing a book like this is that things tend to take longer than projected. 
Some specific things that might delay the release of Honor Among Thieves: 
A big disaster happens and J. gets deployed.
The editoresses get slammed with real life (kids, day jobs, etc.), and take longer than expected.
Beta-readers (see below) take longer than expected to give their feedback.
How Evil Genius Publishing and the author work with these kinds of challenges:

Total transparency about delays, challenges, revised deadlines. We'll update the Evil Genius and Tales From the Hood (author's personal) Facebook pages with regular updates so that contributors and readers know what's going on. 
Prioritize early release of the ebook, with later release of the print version. In our experience, the process of releasing the ebook tends to move more quickly, and so in a situation where real life takes over and we're more pressed for time than we'd anticipated, we'll still get the ebook out as quickly as possible, but hold off on the more labor-intensive print version release.

Make it right: If anyone--contributor to this project, reader--feels that we've not lived up to our promises, whether here or elsewhere, we welcome that feedback, and will do all we can to make it right. 
  ""I made a contribution, but I want to do more..."" There are ways to support this project besides/in addition to financial contribution: 
Be a beta-reader. You commit to reading and giving feedback on an early draft of Honor Among Thieves.  Be a reviewer. Got a blog or a website? Help get the word out by reading a pre-release version of Honor Among Thieves and publishing your review on your site.

<h2><strong>The Project</strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>Lentil as Anything: Everybody deserves a place at the table</em></strong> is Shanaka Fernando’s autobiography. In this book he shares his childhood in Sri Lanka, his travelling years exploring the lifestyles of indigenous people all around the world, and his creation of the Lentil as Anything pay-as-you-feel vegetarian restaurants. The book has recently been published (at our expense and for no profit).  This project is about raising money for the second print run of this book, and so that we can continue to spread the message that generosity, tolerance and an inclusive attitude to community are what the world needs.</p>
<h2><strong>Who I am</strong></h2>
<p>My name is Greg Hill and I have been writing and editing for many years now, usually long term projects for myself or others, sometimes academic and other work for clients. I live in Melbourne with my wife and son and two cats and a dog.</p>
<p>The path I try to walk involves my own personal growth, education and betterment, so that I can hopefully make a positive difference on this planet. Publishing and promoting <strong><em>Lentil as Anything: Everybody deserves a place at the table</em></strong> is a significant part of this.</p>
<h2><strong>About Shanaka and his book</strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>Lentil as Anything: Everybody deserves a place at the table</em></strong> is about a man who has started  a social revolution in Melbourne. Shanaka inspires by example, leading  a simple, modest life as he challenges us in advocating an inclusive, ethical approach to business and life, and a belief in the innate goodness and generosity of our fellow humans.</p>
<p>Shanaka was named Local Hero in the Australia Day awards in 2007 for his non-profit, socially responsible Lentil as Anything restaurants. In his restaurants it is people, not property, that qualify life: ‘You get fed and treated with dignity even if you don’t have any money, and the colour of your skin and your education and your beliefs only put you on a par with everyone else.’</p>
<p>He is a modern day folk hero, offering an alternative way of living which is not based on consumerism, profit and greed. This alternative is being recognized. His Holiness the Dalai Lama asked for Shanaka to join him when he appeared on MasterChef late last year, and from 2009 the Australian Government’s Values Education program, administered by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, has delivered to all Australian schools At What Price, a Primary School resource about Lentil’s values. </p>
<p>The book has a very strong media presence and Shanaka will be speaking at many events, including at Adelaide Writer’s Week where he will be sharing the platform with Andrea Hirato, the author of the <em>The Rainbow Troops, </em>to discuss the topic<em>: </em>It Starts in a Village<em>.</em></p>
<p>For further information about Shanaka, look online. His very prominent 18 minute TEDxTalk, for example, is sensational and can be found at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jodpW59On7g"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jodpW59On7g</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>What is ‘Lentil’?</strong></h2>
<p>Lentil as Anything restaurants – currently existing in Abbotsford, St Kilda and Footscray – are restaurants where money takes a back seat to good food and good company. Patrons of the restaurants ‘pay-as-you-feel’ for their food, depositing whatever they choose to give into a money box. No one knows what anyone pays, and no one is watching to see if patrons even pay anything at all. The restaurants are challenging because patrons (many who soon become members of the loosely defined ‘Lentil community’) are faced with pondering questions like: What can I afford? What do I think the food is worth? Will I pay a reasonable amount for my meal? What can I afford to pay? Will I donate more than the food is worth to make up for someone who cannot afford to pay much at all? Will I volunteer my services?</p>
<p>The restaurants not only provide about a million healthy meals a year, they also provide a venue for volunteers to be part of a unique community: they provide paid work for hundreds of people, often refugees who otherwise struggle to fit in to life in Australia.</p>
<p>The chefs, the staff, the volunteers and the patrons all provide a warm, inclusive atmosphere around the restaurants. It is this, after the example of Shanaka himself, which provides the inspiration for many who have had their lives enriched and even turned around by this ‘Lentil community’.</p>
<h2><strong>Rationale</strong></h2>
<p>The first print run is out, and selling well in book stores. However, the initial production, printing, and publicity costs have been high. We are making a loss from this initial printing of the book, and cannot afford another print run. This now creates an opportunity for all Lentil supporters, and those who want to be, to pledge assistance and receive attractive rewards for doing so.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lentil as Anything: Everybody deserves a place at the table </em></strong>(Vivid Publishing) is an inspiring and in some ways revolutionary book. Without painting Shanaka as a saint, it portrays a background which has led him to be the person he is today, and explains some of the influences behind his radical approach to social issues. Shanaka’s approach has provided millions of meals and created hundreds of jobs, as well as allocating funds to other social and welfare issues.</p>
<p>The book promotes a very worthy cause. It has the capacity to contribute to changing the world and portraying another way – a way of living which minimalizes materialism and fosters generosity, equality and the preservation of each individual’s dignity.</p>
<p>It has been my dream, and still is, to promote Shanaka and the Lentil restaurants. This has been the driving force behind my co-authoring of his memoirs.</p>
<h2>Endorsements</h2>
<em>'Shanaka's stories inspire in me the desire to be and do the best for the world around me. I challenge anyone who reads this book to remain indifferent and unengaged! A must for every would be change-maker.' - </em>Rob Wood, Initiatives of Change, a Global Network of people committed to making Gandhi's 'be the chage' practical and possible, through seeking of inner wisdom and in the application of universal values of honesty, unselfishness, love and purity to everyday life. </div>
<div>
<p><em>‘Fernando is one of those rare pioneers who are prepared to live by their convictions, flaunt social convention and challenge the status quo. The story of his lifelong quest for meaning - and the 'experiment in generosity' that became Lentil As Anything - is inspiring and challenging in equal measure. Few autobiographies are likely to evoke the senses and soul quite as much as Fernando's tale of global travel, self-exploration and cultural innovation.’  - </em>Dr Wayne Visser, Director of Kaleidoscope Futures and author of ""The Quest for Sustainable Business"" and ""The Age of Responsibility""</p>
<p><em> ‘It [Shanaka’s memoirs] reveals Shanaka’s rebellion against a privileged upbringing, the evolution of his political consciousness and concern for social justice, and his ongoing struggles to find inner peace and harmony in the face of the many challenges his alternative vision have triggered. The book records a remarkable journey across numerous cultural boundaries, and the evolution of a true global citizen whose ideals and impact have come from acting locally.’ - </em>Arnold Zable, award-winning Australian author</p>
<p><em>'Creativity, commitment and courage are the three words that for me sum up Shanaka Fernando’s story. This book will be a source of inspiration for all those who aspire to change the world…’ - </em>Professor Paul Komesaroff, Medical Researcher and Philosopher, Monash University </p>
<h2><strong>Where your money will go?</strong></h2>
<p>The book has already been printed and released. Distribution has been organised and the book is well-received in book stores throughout the country. However, our return from book stores doesn’t even pay off the initial debts in preparing and publishing the book. Thus we have no funds for a further print run, and we are seeking to print 1000 or 2000 more books, at a cost of up to $10,000. From this crowdraising we need to raise at least $5000 (and the full $10000 would be fantastic).</p>
<p>These books will continue to be sold in bookstores, as well as at speaking events, and through the Lentil restaurants. Hopefully, with your support, we will also one day be able to implement a pay-as-you-feel set-up for the purchase of these books in some locations – perhaps in the restaurants, perhaps at events, as we are currently sometimes doing. Such an action, following Shanaka’s lead in the Lentil pay-as-you-feel restaurants, will be somewhat of a revolution in the book industry, in making Shanaka’s motivating and transforming story available to all people, regardless of their income or financial resources.</p>

Shanaka inspires by example, leading  a simple, modest life as he challenges us in advocating an inclusive, ethical approach to business and life, and a belief in the innate goodness and generosity of our fellow humans.
Shanaka was named Local Hero in the Australia Day awards in 2007 for his non-profit, socially responsible Lentil as Anything restaurants. In his restaurants it is people, not property, that qualify life: ‘You get fed and treated with dignity even if you don’t have any money, and the colour of your skin and your education and your beliefs only put you on a par with everyone else.’
He is a modern day folk hero, offering an alternative way of living which is not based on consumerism, profit and greed. This alternative is being recognized. His Holiness the Dalai Lama asked for Shanaka to join him when he appeared on MasterChef late last year, and from 2009 the Australian Government’s Values Education program, administered by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, has delivered to all Australian schools At What Price, a Primary School resource about Lentil’s values. 
The book has a very strong media presence and Shanaka will be speaking at many events, including at Adelaide Writer’s Week where he will be sharing the platform with Andrea Hirato, the author of the The Rainbow Troops, to discuss the topic: It Starts in a Village.
For further information about Shanaka, look online. His very prominent 18 minute TEDxTalk, for example, is sensational and can be found at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jodpW59On7g.
What is ‘Lentil’?
Lentil as Anything restaurants – currently existing in Abbotsford, St Kilda and Footscray – are restaurants where money takes a back seat to good food and good company. Patrons of the restaurants ‘pay-as-you-feel’ for their food, depositing whatever they choose to give into a money box. No one knows what anyone pays, and no one is watching to see if patrons even pay anything at all. The restaurants are challenging because patrons (many who soon become members of the loosely defined ‘Lentil community’) are faced with pondering questions like: What can I afford? What do I think the food is worth? Will I pay a reasonable amount for my meal? What can I afford to pay? Will I donate more than the food is worth to make up for someone who cannot afford to pay much at all? Will I volunteer my services?
The restaurants not only provide about a million healthy meals a year, they also provide a venue for volunteers to be part of a unique community: they provide paid work for hundreds of people, often refugees who otherwise struggle to fit in to life in Australia.
The chefs, the staff, the volunteers and the patrons all provide a warm, inclusive atmosphere around the restaurants. It is this, after the example of Shanaka himself, which provides the inspiration for many who have had their lives enriched and even turned around by this ‘Lentil community’.
Rationale
The first print run is out, and selling well in book stores. However, the initial production, printing, and publicity costs have been high. We are making a loss from this initial printing of the book, and cannot afford another print run. This now creates an opportunity for all Lentil supporters, and those who want to be, to pledge assistance and receive attractive rewards for doing so.
Lentil as Anything: Everybody deserves a place at the table (Vivid Publishing) is an inspiring and in some ways revolutionary book. Without painting Shanaka as a saint, it portrays a background which has led him to be the person he is today, and explains some of the influences behind his radical approach to social issues. Shanaka’s approach has provided millions of meals and created hundreds of jobs, as well as allocating funds to other social and welfare issues.
The book promotes a very worthy cause. It has the capacity to contribute to changing the world and portraying another way – a way of living which minimalizes materialism and fosters generosity, equality and the preservation of each individual’s dignity.
It has been my dream, and still is, to promote Shanaka and the Lentil restaurants. This has been the driving force behind my co-authoring of his memoirs.
Endorsements
'Shanaka's stories inspire in me the desire to be and do the best for the world around me. I challenge anyone who reads this book to remain indifferent and unengaged! A must for every would be change-maker.' - Rob Wood, Initiatives of Change, a Global Network of people committed to making Gandhi's 'be the chage' practical and possible, through seeking of inner wisdom and in the application of universal values of honesty, unselfishness, love and purity to everyday life. 

‘Fernando is one of those rare pioneers who are prepared to live by their convictions, flaunt social convention and challenge the status quo. The story of his lifelong quest for meaning - and the 'experiment in generosity' that became Lentil As Anything - is inspiring and challenging in equal measure. Few autobiographies are likely to evoke the senses and soul quite as much as Fernando's tale of global travel, self-exploration and cultural innovation.’  - Dr Wayne Visser, Director of Kaleidoscope Futures and author of ""The Quest for Sustainable Business"" and ""The Age of Responsibility""
 ‘It [Shanaka’s memoirs] reveals Shanaka’s rebellion against a privileged upbringing, the evolution of his political consciousness and concern for social justice, and his ongoing struggles to find inner peace and harmony in the face of the many challenges his alternative vision have triggered. The book records a remarkable journey across numerous cultural boundaries, and the evolution of a true global citizen whose ideals and impact have come from acting locally.’ - Arnold Zable, award-winning Australian author
'Creativity, commitment and courage are the three words that for me sum up Shanaka Fernando’s story. This book will be a source of inspiration for all those who aspire to change the world…’ - Professor Paul Komesaroff, Medical Researcher and Philosopher, Monash University 
Where your money will go?
The book has already been printed and released. Distribution has been organised and the book is well-received in book stores throughout the country. However, our return from book stores doesn’t even pay off the initial debts in preparing and publishing the book. Thus we have no funds for a further print run, and we are seeking to print 1000 or 2000 more books, at a cost of up to $10,000. From this crowdraising we need to raise at least $5000 (and the full $10000 would be fantastic).
These books will continue to be sold in bookstores, as well as at speaking events, and through the Lentil restaurants. Hopefully, with your support, we will also one day be able to implement a pay-as-you-feel set-up for the purchase of these books in some locations – perhaps in the restaurants, perhaps at events, as we are currently sometimes doing. Such an action, following Shanaka’s lead in the Lentil pay-as-you-feel restaurants, will be somewhat of a revolution in the book industry, in making Shanaka’s motivating and transforming story available to all people, regardless of their income or financial resources.

<p>
</p>
<p>By purchasing one of the perks, you help me write this book,
and by doing that, you may help one someone, somewhere gain the courage they
need to seek help. You may even tell someone over lunch sometime that personal
violence is “Not OK”. We have to start talking about it. It has been going on
too long, and it’s time for it to stop. It hasn’t stopped on its own, so we
need to do something. I am starting with this, and  need your help.</p>
There are Public Information programs existing in Emergency Shelters everywhere. If I go over my goal, I will be donating funds to those programs to help get the word out.

This will be the foundation for spreading information - for breaking the silence. With a book, I will be a more appealing speaker and able to attempt to open the minds of more people. We cannot continue to build emergency facilities. Let's reduce the need for them instead.<br/><br/><p>My stance is that everyone is in trouble – both the abuser
and the person receiving the abuse. It’s true that reported victims are 80%
women, but there are men too, and some emergency shelters accommodate men
leaving abusive relationships. Victims are also grandparents, children, and now
we hear regularly about students who are being bullied to death. These kinds of
abusers certainly represent both sexes.</p>
<p>I am inviting people who have been out of their abusive situation for at least five years to contact me. If there are enough of us willing to speak up, perhaps we can create a collection of stories to share. Help me break the silence.<br/></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>If you can't contribute, please forward the info about the campaign through the handy share tools that Indiegogo supplies.

<h2><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">ANNULATION DU PROJET- PROJECT CANCELED.</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12.222222328186035px;"">En concertation avec l'équipe, nous avons décidé d'annuler notre campagne sur Indiegogo.com, avant que cela ne soit trop tard.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 12.222222328186035px;"">Je vous invite à ne pas financer le projet qui se trouve sur cette page.</span></strong></p>

<span style=""font-size: 12.222222328186035px;"">Trois raisons nous poussent à annuler notre campagne:</span>
</div>
<div><span style=""font-size: 12.222222328186035px;""> </span></div>
<div><span style=""font-size: 12.222222328186035px;"">1) Notre manque de stratégie pour promouvoir le projet. Nous avons fait des erreurs, nous nous sommes précipités sur certains points. Nous devons revoir par étape notre façon de communiquer, et arrêter la campagne nous permet d'avoir le recul nécessaire pour mieux agir.</span></div>
<div><span style=""font-size: 12.222222328186035px;""> </span></div>
<div><span style=""font-size: 12.222222328186035px;"">2) Un objectif financier un peu trop élevé et le besoin d'un challenge. Nous n'avions pas eu le choix d'un financement fixe,  le financement flexible  (qui nous autorise à garder les fonds sans atteindre l'objectif) est une bonne idée mais peut ne pas insuffler suffisamment de confiance dans un projet.</span></div>
<div><span style=""font-size: 12.222222328186035px;""> </span></div>
<div><span style=""font-size: 12.222222328186035px;"">3) Le retour du projet sur Paris: nous avons décidé de tester le concept auprès de nos amis, de nos familles, qui seront plus à même de nous aider dans l'amélioration de nos services. Nous tenons aussi à entreprendre en France d'abord, par principe de ne pas faire partie des jeunes exilés français qui tentent l'aventure entrepreneurial ailleurs. </span></div>

<p> </p>
<p>Nous sommes quatre étudiants, bien décidé à développer un projet qui allie application et magazine, le projet Yellowstache.</p>
<p>Arrivés à Montréal en mai 2013, nous voulions découvrir la ville, connaitre et vivre l'ébullition culturelle dont tout le monde parle. En pleine recherche active, une difficulté nous faisait face: celle de l'information.</p>
<p><strong>Qui aujourd'hui peut trouver un événement sur internet si il ne sait pas ce qu'il recherche? N'existe-t-il pas un moyen d'avoir des suggestions qui nous correspondent?</strong></p>
<p>Combien de forums, de sites avons nous parcouru, épuisant notre envie de vivre de nouvelles choses, au fur et à mesure que les gros événements prenaient toute la place dans les résultats de recherche, au fur et à mesure que l'information s'accummulait pêle-mêle, nous rendant incapable de choisir dans un océan de possibilités.</p>
<p>C'est à ce moment là que nous avons eu l'idée de Yellowstache:<strong> un magazine mobile</strong>, pour l'avoir toujours avec soi,<strong> personnalisable</strong>, pour trier l'information selon nos centres d'intérêts, et<strong> autour de l'événementiel</strong>, afin de vivre une expérience dans la réalité physique.  </p>
<p>Yellowstache, c'est un accès toujours plus facile aux événements de petites et moyennes envergures. Il s'agit de créer un média qui fait exister l'information en lien avec ce que l'on est et ce que l'on aime. Vos contributions donneront naissance à une nouvelle façon de s'informer et de vivre des événements dans votre ville.</p>

<p>Yellowstache, c'est une nouvelle façon d'aborder notre navigation sur internet, c'est aussi l'opportunité de vivre des événements de qualité que l'on ne voit pas car leurs budgets de communication ne sont pas assez importants.</p>
<p>Nous considérons que les organisateurs d'événements doivent rencontrer le public qu'il mérite et inversement. Tout nos efforts sont menés vers ce seul et unique but. L'idée de recourir au crowdfunding vient de cet esprit. Un événement sans organisateur et sans public ne peut pas exister, comment concevoir Yellowstache sans eux!</p>
<p>Nous avons fait des contributions avec les contreparties les plus intéressantes possibles: nous voulons que vous faisiez partie intégrante du projet, que vous tiriez avantages de notre existence, vous qui avez décidé de nous soutenir à ce moment décisif.</p>
<p>Yellowstache c'est aussi votre aventure.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Pourquoi 25000 euros (34000 $CAD)?</strong></h3>
<p>Nous avons estimé le budget de la façon suivante:</p>
<ul>
<li>12000 euros ( 16000 $CAD) pour soutenir financièrement l'équipe informatique dans son développement web, IOS et Androïd</li>
<li>13000 euros (18000 $CAD) pour permettre à Arnaud et Benoit de rester dans cette magnifique ville de Montréal, afin de développer le marché chez nos cousins québécois!</li>
<li>Avec la commission de Indiegogo et le coût des contreparties, nous arrivons à un total de 25000 euros (34000$ CAD).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Pourquoi Montréal ?</strong></h3>
<p>Montréal est une ville Hors norme lorsqu'il s'agit d'événementiel: le bouillonnement culturel nous a vraiment surpris, même si nous avions été prévenus avant de partir! Développer le projet ici est une occasion formidable de rapprocher nos deux pays, nos deux cultures et de se connaitre le mieux possible. </p>
<p><strong>Montréal est notre ville-test: elle est l'étape décisive avant un développement sur Paris en Septembre 2014.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Pourquoi Yellowstache?</strong></h3>
<p>La moustache est à la fois une référence à notre état d'esprit et à la nature de l'application.</p>
<p>La moustache est quelque chose d'unique à chacun, deux moustaches identiques ne peuvent exister. Elle symbolise la totale liberté de personnalisation proposée à l'utilisateur dans l'App'zine.</p>
<p>La moustache recquiert aussi de la patience, du travail et un entretien irréprochable: elle symbolise notre philosophie de tous les jours dans le développement du projet.</p>
<p> </p>

<h2><span style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">PROJECT CANCELED</span></h2>
<p>We decided to cancel our campaign Indiegogo.com, before raising too much to cancel.</p>
<p><strong>I urge you not to finance the project from this page.</strong></p>
<p>Donations corresponding to 162 euros already paid, will be transferred to the new campaign in September on Kisskissbankbank or refunded to their owners.</p>
<p>All donations made after this announcement will be directly transferred to the new campaign beginning in September.</p>
<h3><strong>Why the cancellation of the project?</strong></h3>
<p>Three reasons lead us to cancel our campaign:</p>
<p>1) Our lack of strategy to promote the project. We made mistakes, we rushed on certain points. We need to revisit step by step how we communicate, and stop the campaign allows us to have the necessary perspective to be better.</p>
<p>2) We seek a more reasonable financial goal and lsouhaitons a challenge. We did not have the choice of a fixed financing, flexible financing (which allows us to keep the money without achieving the goal) is a good idea but may not inspire enough confidence in a project.</p>
<p>3) The return of the project in Paris: we decided to test the concept with our friends, our families, who will be better able to assist us in improving our services. We also wish to develop the project in France first.</p>
<p>All this explains a strategic shift brings a new identity for our project: Wait a surprise for early September!</p>
<p>I hope that those who follow us understand our approach.</p>

<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">We are four students, well decided to develop a project which links application and magazine, the Yellowstache project. Arrived in Montreal in May, we wanted to discover the city, know much more about this amazing culture, which make everybody talking about it. In a deeply research, we had to face to something difficult: the information.</span></p>
<p><span> Who can today find an event on internet if he doesn’t really know about what he really want to do? Can we find a real way to have suggestions about what we do dealing with what we are? How many forums, websites we’ve been through, wearying our desire to live something new?</span></p>
<p><span> Time after time the biggest events of the year were taking all the websearch results, avoiding us from finding something more special. And then came the idea of Yellowstache : <strong>a mobile magazine, that you can always have with you, wherever you are, to do what you really want to do. An application in which you can choose, classify the information related to your tastes. And all this turns around events, to make you live experiences, which really look like yourself. </strong></span></p>
<p><span>Yellowstache is an easier access to events from small and middle scales. This is all about creating a media, which makes exists the information linked with who you are and what you like. Your contributions will give life to a new way of information and a new way to live some event around where you live.</span></p>

<p>Yellowstache, it’s the new way of finding events on internet, but it’s also the opportunity to live new things, things that we could not have find in some other ways because of the small advertising budget they often have. We consider that the event organizers must know their public and vice versa. All our effort are concentrated on one aim : resort to the crowd funding. An event can’t exist without any organizer and public. How think about Yellowstache in an other way?</p>
<p><span>We did contributions, with perks, the more interesting possible. We wanted you to make part of our project; we wanted you to have many advantages from us, you guys who decided to support ourselves in this precious moment. </span></p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong> Why 25000 euros (34 000$ CAD )? </strong></h3>
<p><span>We have estimated the budget in this way : </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>16000$ CAD to support financially the computer hardware team in the web development, IOS and Android.</span></li>
<li><span>12000$ CAD to allow Benoit and Arnaud to stay in Montreal, and makes them develop the Canadian market.</span></li>
<li><span> With the commission from Indiegogo and the cost of compensations, we finally arrived to 34 000$ CAD. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Why Montréal? </strong></h3>
<p><span>Montréal is a city out of the range when you talk about event : and even if we were warned about it, we were totally surprised when we saw how the city was full of life ! Develop this project here is a perfect occasion to get our two countries closer and know much about each other.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Why Yellowstache? </strong></h3>
<p><span>The reference to the mustache is related to our state of mind and also to the nature of the application. The mustache is something unique to anybody; two same mustaches cannot exist. It symbolizes the whole freedom to personalize your profile in the App’zine.</span></p>
<p><span>The mustache requires patience, work and a full upkeep: it symbolizes our everyday philosophy in the development of the project. </span></p>
<h3><span> </span></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Other ways to help us :</span></h3>
<p><span>If you cannot help us for obvious reasons, help us trying to make the project being popular by posting about it.</span></p>

ANNULATION DU PROJET- PROJECT CANCELED.
En concertation avec l'équipe, nous avons décidé d'annuler notre campagne sur Indiegogo.com, avant que cela ne soit trop tard.
Je vous invite à ne pas financer le projet qui se trouve sur cette page.
Les dons correspondant au 162 euros déjà versés, seront soit transférés sur la nouvelle campagne en septembre sur Kisskissbankbank, soit remboursés auprès de leurs propriétaires.
Tous les dons faits après cette annonce seront directement transférés sur la nouvelle campagne début Septembre.
Pourquoi l'annulation du projet?
Trois raisons nous poussent à annuler notre campagne:

 
1) Notre manque de stratégie pour promouvoir le projet. Nous avons fait des erreurs, nous nous sommes précipités sur certains points. Nous devons revoir par étape notre façon de communiquer, et arrêter la campagne nous permet d'avoir le recul nécessaire pour mieux agir.
 
2) Un objectif financier un peu trop élevé et le besoin d'un challenge. Nous n'avions pas eu le choix d'un financement fixe,  le financement flexible  (qui nous autorise à garder les fonds sans atteindre l'objectif) est une bonne idée mais peut ne pas insuffler suffisamment de confiance dans un projet.
 
3) Le retour du projet sur Paris: nous avons décidé de tester le concept auprès de nos amis, de nos familles, qui seront plus à même de nous aider dans l'amélioration de nos services. Nous tenons aussi à entreprendre en France d'abord, par principe de ne pas faire partie des jeunes exilés français qui tentent l'aventure entrepreneurial ailleurs. 
 
Tout cela explique un virage stratégique qui amène à une nouvelle identité de notre projet: on vous garde la surprise pour début Septembre!
 
J'espère que ceux qui nous suivent comprennent notre démarche.
 
Moustachement vôtre
 
L'équipe Yellowstache
 
PS: La boîte à dialogue reste ouverte, si vous avez des questions, des remarques ou des réactions, exprimez-vous!
 

 L'histoire du projet.
 
Nous sommes quatre étudiants, bien décidé à développer un projet qui allie application et magazine, le projet Yellowstache.
Arrivés à Montréal en mai 2013, nous voulions découvrir la ville, connaitre et vivre l'ébullition culturelle dont tout le monde parle. En pleine recherche active, une difficulté nous faisait face: celle de l'information.
Qui aujourd'hui peut trouver un événement sur internet si il ne sait pas ce qu'il recherche? N'existe-t-il pas un moyen d'avoir des suggestions qui nous correspondent?
Combien de forums, de sites avons nous parcouru, épuisant notre envie de vivre de nouvelles choses, au fur et à mesure que les gros événements prenaient toute la place dans les résultats de recherche, au fur et à mesure que l'information s'accummulait pêle-mêle, nous rendant incapable de choisir dans un océan de possibilités.
C'est à ce moment là que nous avons eu l'idée de Yellowstache: un magazine mobile, pour l'avoir toujours avec soi, personnalisable, pour trier l'information selon nos centres d'intérêts, et autour de l'événementiel, afin de vivre une expérience dans la réalité physique.  
Yellowstache, c'est un accès toujours plus facile aux événements de petites et moyennes envergures. Il s'agit de créer un média qui fait exister l'information en lien avec ce que l'on est et ce que l'on aime. Vos contributions donneront naissance à une nouvelle façon de s'informer et de vivre des événements dans votre ville.
 

      La page d'accueil            Les événements                Votre e-ticket                  Les médias


 
 
 Notre philosophie
Yellowstache, c'est une nouvelle façon d'aborder notre navigation sur internet, c'est aussi l'opportunité de vivre des événements de qualité que l'on ne voit pas car leurs budgets de communication ne sont pas assez importants.
Nous considérons que les organisateurs d'événements doivent rencontrer le public qu'il mérite et inversement. Tout nos efforts sont menés vers ce seul et unique but. L'idée de recourir au crowdfunding vient de cet esprit. Un événement sans organisateur et sans public ne peut pas exister, comment concevoir Yellowstache sans eux!
Nous avons fait des contributions avec les contreparties les plus intéressantes possibles: nous voulons que vous faisiez partie intégrante du projet, que vous tiriez avantages de notre existence, vous qui avez décidé de nous soutenir à ce moment décisif.
Yellowstache c'est aussi votre aventure.

 
 
 Les questions que vous pouvez vous poser.
 
Pourquoi 25000 euros (34000 $CAD)?
Nous avons estimé le budget de la façon suivante:

12000 euros ( 16000 $CAD) pour soutenir financièrement l'équipe informatique dans son développement web, IOS et Androïd
13000 euros (18000 $CAD) pour permettre à Arnaud et Benoit de rester dans cette magnifique ville de Montréal, afin de développer le marché chez nos cousins québécois!
Avec la commission de Indiegogo et le coût des contreparties, nous arrivons à un total de 25000 euros (34000$ CAD).

 
Pourquoi Montréal ?
Montréal est une ville Hors norme lorsqu'il s'agit d'événementiel: le bouillonnement culturel nous a vraiment surpris, même si nous avions été prévenus avant de partir! Développer le projet ici est une occasion formidable de rapprocher nos deux pays, nos deux cultures et de se connaitre le mieux possible. 
Montréal est notre ville-test: elle est l'étape décisive avant un développement sur Paris en Septembre 2014.
 
Pourquoi Yellowstache?
La moustache est à la fois une référence à notre état d'esprit et à la nature de l'application.
La moustache est quelque chose d'unique à chacun, deux moustaches identiques ne peuvent exister. Elle symbolise la totale liberté de personnalisation proposée à l'utilisateur dans l'App'zine.
La moustache recquiert aussi de la patience, du travail et un entretien irréprochable: elle symbolise notre philosophie de tous les jours dans le développement du projet.
 
 


 D'autres façons de nous aider.
Avant de vous énoncer les autres façons de nous aider, nous précisons que toutes les contributions incluant des crédits d'achats sur notre site sont valables à la fois sur Montréal à partir de Janvier 2014 et sur Paris en Septembre 2014 (hormis les invitations aux événements, qui se dérouleront exclusivement sur Montréal).
Si vous ne pouvez pas nous aider, pour des raisons évidentes, aidez nous à rendre ce projet visible. Tenez compte que moins de 10% des gens que l'on sollicite décide de supporter financièrement un projet.
De manière totalement gratuite, vous pouvez:
-Parler de notre site de présentation de Yellowstache en diffusant le lien ci dessous:
http://yellowstache.fr/
-Nous aider à atteindre les 30.000 invités, en partageant l'évènement que nous avons créé sur Facebook à vos amis:

- Sans oublier les outils de partage présents sur Indiegogo!

 Time after time the biggest events of the year were taking all the websearch results, avoiding us from finding something more special. And then came the idea of Yellowstache : a mobile magazine, that you can always have with you, wherever you are, to do what you really want to do. An application in which you can choose, classify the information related to your tastes. And all this turns around events, to make you live experiences, which really look like yourself. 
Yellowstache is an easier access to events from small and middle scales. This is all about creating a media, which makes exists the information linked with who you are and what you like.

<p>A hajóknak a műszaki rajzoktól a festményeken át az élethű valódi és virtuális modellekig számos ábrázolásmódja létezik. Ezek speciális formája a jellegrajz. A hajóprofilok különböző részletességgel és céllal készültek: A világháborúkban a tengeren harcolók zsebében lapuló sziluett-könyvek ábrái segítették az ellenség azonosítását, erejének és sebességének időben történő felismerését.</p>
<p>A hajóprofilok a hajózási könyveknek is kedvelt témái. Az utóbbi évtizedekben megjelent ilyen témájú gyűjteményes kötetekben mégis csak jellemzően kisméretű, ezért elnagyolt ábrázolásokat közöltek, amelyek sajnálatosan kevéssé részlet-gazdagok, a megismerésnek csak vázlatos lehetőségét biztosítják. A legnagyobb – kiemelhető és önálló képként akár be is keretezhető – nagy, színes táblákat tartalmazó hajóportré-kötet utoljára 1965-ben jelent meg, ám az is csak 12 hajóportréval.</p>
<p>Azóta a digitális ábrázolási technikák ugrásszerű fejlődése és az egykori hajókra vonatkozó adatok – eredeti hajógyári tervek, építői modellek és archív fotódokumentumok digitális feldolgozása és elérhetővé tétele révén az ábrázolás lehetőségei minden korábbinál pontosabbá és látványosabbá váltak.</p>
<p>Balogh Tamás az óceánjáró személyhajók szerelmese. Tervei szerint összesen mintegy 150 hajóprofil készül, a XIX. és a XX. század leghíresebb óceánjáró személyszállító hajóinak nagyméretű, színes jellegrajzaival. Ezek egy reprezentatív kötetbe gyűjtve jelennek meg, amely rendhagyó emléket állít az óceáni személyhajózás nagy korszakának.</p>
<p>Az óceánjárók az emberiség legnagyobb technikai-, munkaerő- és anyagi ráfordítással készültműszaki alkotásai közé tartoznak, amelyek a repülőgépek megjelenéséig az egyetlen átkelési lehetőséget biztosították a kontinensek között. Kezdetben ez a közlekedési mód is – mint minden más az életben – elsősorban inkább veszélyes volt, mint kényelmes. Az emberiség technikai-műszaki (és nem utolsó sorban esztétikai) fejlődésével azonban az egyszerre több ezer embert befogadó hatalmas hajók fedélzetén az Európa és Amerika között eltöltött 5-6 nap a transzóceáni átkelést az utasok számára egyedülálló élménnyé avatta. </p>

<br/>
<p>A legkiválóbb hajók pedig gyakran nemzeti szimbólumokká magasztosultak, amelyeket a leggyorsabb átkelés rekordját biztosító erőteljes gépek, a legpompásabb berendezés, elegancia és kényelem jellemzett.A mai óriási kirándulóhajók fedélzetén átélhető élmény sokban hasonlít ehhez, a menetrend szerinti óceáni átkeléssel töltött egyetlen hét varázsa azonban az 1960-as években örökre elenyészett... Ma már csak a rá emlékeztető tárgyak – köztük az igényes kivitelű hajóprofilok – segítenek felidézni ezt a kort.</p>
<p>Balogh Tamás rajzai digitális technológiával készültek, olyan felbontásban, amely gyakorlatilag majdnem tetszőleges méretű nagyítást tesz lehetővé. </p>
<p>Az alkotó több száz korabeli fotóra és tervre, valamint a fennmaradt eredeti hajógyári modellekre is kiterjedő előzetes kutatómunkájának köszönhetően az általa készített hajóprofilok a legkisebb részletekig valósághűek, azokon szinte minden külső szerkezeti elem látható. Az alkalmazott színezési és árnyékolási technikák pedig a kétdimenziós megjelenítés során a lehetőségek határáig fokozzák az ábrázolás plasztikusságát. Munkája eredményeként így a szemnek is kellemes, az óceánjárókért rajongók számára pedig ritka élményt nyújtó alkotások jönnek létre, amelyeket Balogh Tamás most – a hajók történetéről szóló rövid leírással kiegészítve – egy kötetbe gyűjtve kíván átnyújtani az Olvasóknak.</p>
<p>Ehhez várjuk segítségüket, amellyel meghaladjuk az összes korábbi hasonló ábrázolás minőségét és mennyiségét egyaránt. Legyen részese Ön is ennek a csodálatos utazásnak!</p>

Másrészt a design rendelhető (a megrendelők digitálisan kapják a hajókat ábrázolásait, amelyeket aztán tetszés szerint a legkülönfélébb formában használhatnak) – a megadott mintákból történő választást követően a kérésüknek megfelelően – iratgyűjtőre, csomagoló papírra, lakásdekorációs anyagokra (szőnyegre, tapétára, stb.) feldolgozva.</p>
<p>Sőt: a jellegrajzok felhasználásával hosszabb távon a gyermekeknek szóló – „who is who” típusú – hajós memóriajáték készül. Így a most elkészülő könyv tulajdonképpen egy az óceánjárók rajongói számára készült kollekció bevezető része.</p>

Thus began the flow of confessions, the biggest of which was admitting to using the Emotional Freedom Technique (tapping) in the shower.   The technique looks rather silly, which keeps many people (including myself at one time) from using this energy modality.  Yet, as I have come to find it, it is very powerful.

<p>Welcome
to our Indiegogo campaign to Pre-order The Essential Book of K9 and  become a
huge part in making the book bigger than we could ever hope for.</p>
<p>I'm <strong>Paul
Tams</strong>, who along with K9's original co-creator <strong>BOB BAKER</strong> created K9's own TV
series which has and is still being broadcast on <strong>BBC KIDS, CHANNEL TEN, DISNEY
XD, SY-FY, FIVE</strong> and<strong> THE CARTOON NETWORK</strong>, as well as on channels in many
countries as diverse as TURKEY and RUSSIA.</p>
<p></p>

<p>The love
for classic and new K9 is widespread across a vast age group across the world
and we are passionate about celebrating this character in both further TV
exploits and on the printed page.</p>
<p>K9 is an
iconic character, having appeared firstly for several years in DOCTOR WHO; his
own New Year BBC Special, THE SARAH JANE ADVENTURES and a return to DOCTOR WHO
alongside 10th Doctor, David Tennant, then his own TV series featuring an upgraded design.  It's amazing there has never been a book
dedicated to the full story of K9; his adventures in Time and Space and beyond
and the making of the TV shows in which he appeared.  We aim to correct this
oversight and present an amazing volume of Features, Photos and behind the
scenes information. We also aim to have several new Stories and comic strips
from Classic Writers including BOB BAKER himself.</p>
<p><strong>This book
will be unique and your funding will help us publish the definitive version
that most publishers would see as too risky and costly to invest in. </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1155128/files/20150117035506-iggbanner.jpg?1421495706"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>We want to use the
funding to also pay for classic comic strip artists  and expand the page count
to well over 100 full colour pages. Writers and Artists and contributors will be announced as the campaign progresses.</strong></p>

</div></div>","Welcome
to our Indiegogo campaign to Pre-order The Essential Book of K9 and  become a
huge part in making the book bigger than we could ever hope for.
I'm Paul
Tams, who along with K9's original co-creator BOB BAKER created K9's own TV
series which has and is still being broadcast on BBC KIDS, CHANNEL TEN, DISNEY
XD, SY-FY, FIVE and THE CARTOON NETWORK, as well as on channels in many
countries as diverse as TURKEY and RUSSIA.


The love
for classic and new K9 is widespread across a vast age group across the world
and we are passionate about celebrating this character in both further TV
exploits and on the printed page.
K9 is an
iconic character, having appeared firstly for several years in DOCTOR WHO; his
own New Year BBC Special, THE SARAH JANE ADVENTURES and a return to DOCTOR WHO
alongside 10th Doctor, David Tennant, then his own TV series featuring an upgraded design.  It's amazing there has never been a book
dedicated to the full story of K9; his adventures in Time and Space and beyond
and the making of the TV shows in which he appeared.  We aim to correct this
oversight and present an amazing volume of Features, Photos and behind the
scenes information. We also aim to have several new Stories and comic strips
from Classic Writers including BOB BAKER himself.
This book
will be unique and your funding will help us publish the definitive version
that most publishers would see as too risky and costly to invest in. 



We want to use the
funding to also pay for classic comic strip artists  and expand the page count
to well over 100 full colour pages. Writers and Artists and contributors will be announced as the campaign progresses.
We have set a goal of £5,000 UK pounds which will pay for print costs and some of our production costs involved. If we
are lucky enough to exceed this amount we will approach other writers and illustrators to help
expand the book and make it an invaluable must have for any fan's collection. All funds will go into making the book Bigger and even better!

<h3>Necesitamos juntar la mayor cantidad de dinero posible para solventar la investigación de los técnicos y programadores que podrían desarrollar este dispositivo y ustedes nuestros colaboradores recibirían además de la gratificación de ayudar, un video de Naza agradeciendo en persona por vuestra ayuda ademas de recibir actualizaciones sobre los avances del proyecto.</h3>
<h3>Con la ayuda de ustedes no sólo benefician a Nazareno sino a toda aquella persona que pueda necesitar del desarrollo de este dispositivo ya que podría servir también a las personas que sufren un ACV por ejemplo.</h3>

<h3>Poder concretar este sueño no sólo ayudará a nuestro hijo a tener una vida lo mas normal posible, también sería un adelanto de la ciencia para todas las personas que lo necesiten, éste dispositivo sería fácil de usar y fácil de personalizar no importa si el paciente es niño o adulto, podría significar la diferencia entre caminar y estar en una silla de ruedas.</h3>

Necesitamos juntar la mayor cantidad de dinero posible para solventar la investigación de los técnicos y programadores que podrían desarrollar este dispositivo y ustedes nuestros colaboradores recibirían además de la gratificación de ayudar, un video de Naza agradeciendo en persona por vuestra ayuda ademas de recibir actualizaciones sobre los avances del proyecto.
Con la ayuda de ustedes no sólo benefician a Nazareno sino a toda aquella persona que pueda necesitar del desarrollo de este dispositivo ya que podría servir también a las personas que sufren un ACV por ejemplo.


Poder concretar este sueño no sólo ayudará a nuestro hijo a tener una vida lo mas normal posible, también sería un adelanto de la ciencia para todas las personas que lo necesiten, éste dispositivo sería fácil de usar y fácil de personalizar no importa si el paciente es niño o adulto, podría significar la diferencia entre caminar y estar en una silla de ruedas.


Si no puedes colaborar con nuestro proyecto, puedes darlo a conocer, es gratis y casi no lleva tiempoo hacerlo, cuanta mas gente se entere mas probable es que podamos llevarlo a cabo y por supuesto estaremos mas que agradecidos de tu ayuda.

<p>Last year, when I first started working on my web serial <i>Defiant, </i>I had no idea that doing a weekly piece of public writing could be so transformative and worthwhile. Not only did readers respond, they quickly made my weekly installments of <i>Defiant </i>into the most read and reshared feature of my blog. For the first time in my writing career, I had people emailing me and asking for more of my work, more quickly. This whole project had just started as a doodle--a side story to work on when I got frustrated with my ongoing novel project, and it was growing into my most appreciated work. <br/></p>
<p>It didn't take long for me to double down on it. I started laying the groundwork for a more extensive personal story than the original outline called for, opening relationship and family questions that could sustain at least another thirty chapter series, if not a much longer run. By the time the story concluded, I felt like I had gotten there. Still, I wished that I had more material to draw from. I had a few questions planted in the plot that I needed to answer in the next season, but I didn't know what the answers were quite yet.<br/></p>
<p>What was the thematic anchor? Who (other than his partner) would become pivotal in this new phase of his life? What had happened to his family? They had been a strong part of <i>Nothing is Right</i>, and yet, when I wrote <i>Defiant, </i>I found that Clay was estranged from the people who had shaped his formative years. That was when I realized what I'd been missing:</p>
<p>Before I could tell a story about where Clay Dillon is going, I needed to go back and tell more of the story of where he's been.</p>
<p>That's what <i>Imaginary Friends</i> is all about. It's a sequel to my first book, <i>Nothing is Right</i>, but it's also a sequel to the first part of <i>Defiant</i>, because it's going to be laying the groundwork for the major themes of familial pressure, bullying, and expectation that will be essential to the story I want to tell in the next season of that series.</p>
<p>If this all sounds exciting but you're a little wary of jumping into a series on the third installment, don't worry--I give a pretty solid overview below, and I'm offering plenty of perks that include copies of the other Clay Dillon books.</p>
<h2>Our Tale So Far...</h2>
<p><i>Nothing is Right:</i> The first story about Clay was about growing up, learning to make friends, and becoming detached from your parents for the first time. In it, we followed Clay through his first grade year, seeing his challenges from his own point-of-view. I based much of Clay's perceptiveness on my own process of maturation growing up, including his vivid imagination and his tendency to shield himself with stories. In this book, we are also introduced to the public school system in Clay's small town, and we can see that the people there mean well but that they don't really understand Clay. We also find out, in various ways, that Clay's parents have some... questionable... methods when it comes to child-rearing, and that they value obedience and invisibility over inquisitiveness, discovery, and spectacle.</p><p>Much of the tension in Clay's life comes from the fact that he knows how to make overtures of hospitality, and he knows that they will make up for some of the things he doesn't understand, but his parents close their house and their lives to him, preferring their insular social circle to his attempts to reach out and make friends.</p><p><i>Defiant: Season One: </i>In this story, we join a thirty year old Clay as he attempts, for the first time, to work for other people. The strain of attempting to work a ""regular"" job and the complex emotional baggage surrounding his spouse Noahleen's recent brain surgery have led him to try to seek psychiatric care, but because he does not have health insurance, his options are limited and he is forced to settle for a clinician whose methods don't work well with Clay's personality.</p><p>Still, he attempts to make do and to get along. The longer he sees Dr. Williams though, the more he finds himself wrestling with bouts of  anxiety and stress. He comes to understand these as suppressed feelings that have always asserted themselves during major changes in his life, and by the end of the story, he comes to terms with the fact that his personal transformation needs to reach well beyond accepting the truth about himself: that he is not just autistic, not just the one who has to work, not just inclined toward a certain sexual preference or gender presentation, but that all of these things are constantly interacting with each other and producing new challenges for him<i>, and that they will continue to do so</i> no matter how comfortable he thinks he's become within his own skin.<br/></p><p><i>Imaginary Friends </i>will extend both of these storylines by showing us Clay's second grade year and following him through catechism to his first Holy Communion. Along the way, it will also allow us to see how his personal relationships with his classmates are developing. It will also show us how his mother's Catholicism, her family background, and the circumstances of his birth work against his needs to put him into situations that he can not understand or navigate without help. Last of all, It will prepare us for Clay's reunion with his mother's family in <i>Defiant: Season Two</i>, providing us with the backstory that allows us to understand the dynamics in the family relationships that have formed during his absence.</p><p>That's all I'm saying for now. If you want to know <i>how </i>these things are going to play out, you'll need to wait until the story rolls out on <a href=""http://www.mmonjejr.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my blog</a>. If you can make a donation, then you can help that happen sooner rather than later.<br/></p><p></p><h2>Aims and Goals</h2>
<p>When I ran <i>Defiant </i>last year, I only had the time to run a single chapter each week, and I wound up needing a little more than six months to run the complete book. This year, I want to run <i>Imaginary Friends </i>and to at least start <i>Defiant'</i>s second season, but <i>Imaginary Friends </i>alone has almost fifty chapters. If I'm stuck running them at a rate of one per week, it will take until Summer 2015 to complete just that storyline.</p>
<p>That's where you come in. If this campaign is successful, I will basically be able to hire myself to write this serial for a month. That will be enough time for me to lay out rough versions of each chapter, to revise the first twenty into workable shape, and to proofread and queue up the first month of final, polished chapters. It'll give me a push that will allow the story to run at a pace of 2-3 chapters per week, which will shorten the release schedule from 54 weeks to about 20.</p>
<p>To do that, I need $3,200. That money will cover the basic costs for the book: my writing time, editing, proofreading, and formatting for the print and ebook editions<i>. </i>It will allow me to pay my cover designer and other freelancers who are working on this project, and it will keep me from having to extend the production schedule by doing all of these things myself.<br/></p><p>If I hit my funding goal, the money will also will also cover the first two months of advertising after release, the ISBN registration, distribution, and other miscellaneous costs of publication. If I don't hit my goal, then I will be using whatever funds I do raise to pay for as much production help as I can afford, in order to decrease the production time by as much as I'm able.<br/></p>
<p>If the stars align right and we raise an excess of funds, then I am also prepared to offer extra benefits, including a possible print edition of <i>Defiant </i>season one for contributors at the $30 perk. First things first, though: before I can give you <i>Defiant </i>in paperback, I've got to raise the money to put <i>Imaginary Friends</i> on my blog.</p><h2>Spread the word
</h2><p>I'm grateful for anything you can do, from posting this to Facebook or Tumblr to blogging about it, reviewing my existing books, or driving new Twitter followers in my direction. And you'll still be able to enjoy the enhanced release schedule for <i>Imaginary Friends</i> as it unfolds on my blog.</p><p>I can really use the help, because there's no way for me to maintain a presence on every single social network that comes around these days, and it is undeniably a good thing to get my campaign posted to as many of them as possible. To do that, I need people who are active in those spaces to post this campaign for me or to link to the video pitch on Youtube.</p><p>After you donate, or if you want to help but you can't donate, please do me a favor by passing this campaign on through whatever social media you use most often. It will help me to reach my goal, and it will also let more people know about the project so that they will be reading when the first chapters start to roll out.<br/></p>
<h2>Closing</h2>
<p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I really mean that. Even if you don't donate, by the time you get to these words you will have spent a lot of time and energy considering my project. I appreciate that you gave me that level of attention, even if you can't help me out this time.</p>- Michael Scott Monje, Jr.</div>","UPDATE:With only 2 weeks left on the campaign, I am done with the first 5 chapters.

I plan to use modified photography to illustrate parts of the series and will use a percentage of the funding to replace some of the lost photography.

The Odyssey website will be devoted to illustrated serialised adventures of the principle character, Rodrick Brown, a Black sailor-journalist. What Rod and I bring to the readership are in-depth and action accounts of Black maritime heritage, mysticism, romance, adventure with it all placed aboard sailing vessels along and within the Caribbean Basin and Mexico. The title, Odyssey, will use the Homeric adventure stories in contemporary renderings of actual tales.The readership focus group ranges from teenager to the elderly, with an interested literacy and without a gender bearing.

OdysseyThe first tale - Odyssey - is about the return voyage of a turtle schooner from San Francisco to its home port in the San Sebastian Islands. There are problems from the outset because the crew is white and Rod is an Afro-American, resulting in a long stop-over in Mexico under the spell of a the spiritual cult of Madre Negra. Odyssey has 17 chapters and more than 97,000 words. I have three other novels for Odyssey Series and Rod will be getting involved with situations in San Francisco, Key West, Cayman Islands, Haiti, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Turks and Caicos Islands, Mexico, Columbia, Panama, Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua. Shipwreck     The funding is to have the Odyssey website set up, maintained and illustrations created. A little more than 10 years ago I shipwrecked in the Tulum (Mexico) lagoon on my way back to the States after a nine-year research voyage focussing on the Caymanian Diaspora in the Northern and Western Caribbean. About one-third of my tapes and photography was lost. I plan to use modified photography to illustrate parts of the series and will use a percentage of the funding to replace some of the lost photography. There are 21 perfect reef protected tropical coves on Roatan Island in the Bay Islands of Honduras and Rio Dulce in Guatemala has jungle cliff faces and at their bases are small traditional  Mayan villages. Tales The stories will be posted every week with the old-time cliff hanger ending. I have created the character of Captain Rod Brown to tell his adventures that are really those I have heard or experienced. Most of what is written can generally be called tales but fiction is what I am sticking to and this gives me the range in writing to shape the readers' feelings. This is also my way of getting Black maritime heritage into a readership who are curious about our involvement with the sea.Sailing The TropicsWithout getting too involved with my passion for this area of heritage and history I will say that the settings for the stories vary from cascading waterfalls to deep jungle, surging seas to translucent still waters. The characters are always individual and merges of many, many people who roam the waters of the world. There are prison torturers and innocent divas, prejudiced bullies and a university professor who is a gay shipwright. Rod is a city boy who becomes a part of the seafaring tropics without knowing it and that is what I want the readership to become a part of also.Adventures Are On Course
As for my campaign, if the goal is not reached, I will attempt to have the website built without the high quality input it should have, use the stories I have at present without photographing the missing story locations, and the illustrations of those locations might have to be fewer. I hope that we will put Rod Brown on his website and colour it with the richness of his adventures. This is being written from aboard our 124-year old Dutch Sailing Barge, Aenna Te Gondern, where we live in the oldest shipyard in the maritime community of Woodbridge, Suffolk, England.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Who am I?</h3>

<p>Bill Stokes, Wisconsin's most famous outdoor writer.</p><p>Born in Barron, Wisconsin, on September 11, 1931, Bill Stokes grew up on a small dairy farm between Barron and Rice Lake. He began his official writing career as an outdoor writer and also a general reporter for the Stevens Point Daily Journal where he served as columnist, reporter and outdoor writer. In 1961 he moved to the Wisconsin State Journal, out of Madison, where he wrote outdoor and personal columns. Some of these writings from his columns appear in the book “Ship The Kids On Ahead.” In 1969, the Milwaukee Journal became his venue as a feature writer and columnist. In 1982 he found new ground to cover in 1982 at the Chicago Tribune. After 11 years at the Chicago Tribune, Bill decided to retire and pursue free-lance projects.</p>
<p>During his long journalism career, Bill won many conservation awards, including the Ernie Pyle Memorial Award from Scripps-Howard News Service in 1972! His work has appeared in many national publications; to name a few: Readers Digest, Outdoor Life and Sports Afield. He has compiled three anthologies of his newspaper writing and has authored two children’s books.</p>
<p>His writing, his perspective on life and his passion makes him a masterful story teller. His ability to tell the story and make the connection with his readers is uncanny; taking him to audio with one of the voice professionals below will only enhance the listeners enjoyment.</p><p>Bill is also a veteran of the Korean War where he fought as an infantryman for the US Army.</p>
<p>Bill is in the process of publishing his latest novel. One fan had this to say:</p>
<p><i>Bill writes with good humor and feeling. His descriptions make his readers think about their own personal lives and put their feelings toward their fellow men in proper perspective. -Warren P. Knowles, Governor of Wisconsin, 1965-1971</i></p>
<p><b>Sample Story</b></p>
<blockquote>
<b>The Hammer Is In The Petunias</b><br/>
It WAS one of those “next week we’ve got to get organized” days that inspired me to pound peg board all over one end of the basement for neat and convenient storage of tools and such.<br/>
And it was something to behold—the hammer and the pliers and the saws reposing with an orderliness they had never before known. I sat for most of the rest of the day just admiring how beautiful it was.<br/>
Then sometime the next forenoon my wife needed a nail driven into a closet wall; and it was pure joy to walk down to the basement knowing that the hammer was in its place just waiting for some hammering. No more frantic searching, no more finding the kids to question them about the hammer whereabouts.
“I would be delighted to drive that nail for you,” I told Betty. “I will get my trusty hammer off its hook, and I will drive it for you right this very minute.”<br/>
I remember I even whistled as I walked down the stairs. Then I reached for the hammer, and, as unbelievable as it may seem, the hammer was not there.
We have been robbed, I thought, remembering the stem lecture the family had been given about putting things back in their rightful peg-board places.<br/>
“Where’s the hammer?” I shouted.<br/>
“Larry had it,” Scotty said.<br/>
“Ricky had it,” Larry said.<br/>
“Scotty had it,"" Ricky said.<br/>
“I didn’t have it,” Mike said.<br/>
I found it in the petunia patch where it had been used to crack a walnut that had been snitched out of the kitchen.<br/>
Why not, I asked myself, just store the hammer in the petunia patch?<br/>
And so that is how it is. The hammer can most generally be located among the petunias, albeit a bit rusty, but serviceable nonetheless.<br/>
The hammer was followed by the pliers in the move to what I call natural storage. The pliers are kept under the cookbooks in a kitchen drawer. The saw hangs in the treehouse.<br/>

Betty’s sewing basket is where we find the screwdriver. The best place to look for the wrenches is out in the garage between the garbage cans where bicycle repair is most often done.<br/>
And the peg-board hooks? Well, the use varies, but they are used for: a broken cap pistol, a tom cowboy shirt, the wheels from a toy tank, an old picture of Batman, and other things of this nature.<br/>
Are we organized? We are indeed. This very second I can tell you that the bathroom plunger is out under the hedge. If that isn’t organization, I’d like to know what is?<br/>

Interestingly, Sands didn’t come to audiobooks through acting as most narrators do. She began her adult life as a visual artist. “I used to paint. I did a lot of photo manipulation, and just a whole bunch of handcrafting of all kinds.” How did she get involved in the audio world? “My daughter and I had a long commute for many years, and we went through a million audiobooks.” She also read aloud to her daughter, until it dawned on her: “I would love to do that.” She didn’t think her voice would be one that anyone would want to hear, but she really wanted to try her hand at narration. So in 2008, she discovered a supportive audio community that encouraged recording. She worked with them for a few years before she was “discovered.”</p>

<h3>Summing it Up</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Joe Dell, and yes, I am an average Joe. Just a hard-working man with a few dreams. Telling stories has always been a passion of mine and I’m hoping you’ll join me on my journey and help me tell this story to the world.  </p>
<p>Fort Apollo tells of the story of five boys on the brink of adolescence; it follows them along their many adventures during the summer of 1969. This story follows the boys as they navigate the turbulent times at the end of the sixties in their own unique way. Their sense of adventure and imagination know no bounds and they get involved in one situation after another. Michael is the leader of this small band of friends, physically abused by his father and emotionally neglected by his mother. In a twist of fate a woman comes into his life.

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Like I said, I’m an average Joe. There are no special monuments in my name and I haven’t won the Pulitzer or any purple hearts. But you helping me reach my goal will allow me to complete this story which I have been working on and growing for over twenty years. In the past two years I have finally been able to put it all together. With your help, I’ll be able to write the story and get it published. Your contribution will help me put this story on paper, finally! It’ll help with editing costs, artwork, and publishing. This an amazing story! I know that is a bold statement, but I am going to back it up by letting you read the first chapter.</p>
<p>One of the things that I’m especially excited about is the local help that I’ve already received since moving to the Lehigh Valley in PA. Michael Kehs is a woodworking artist and he’s really pumped up to help me build the main character Michael’s skateboard to give to you as a perk. He’s also going to build the shingle shooter and slingshot!</p>
<p>Hannah Hess is an amazing local artist her painting of the book cover captures the innocence of the boys while the dark silhouettes at the bottom foreshadow conflicts to come. </p>
<p>And finally, there’s Wendy Strain. She’s fantastic writer and editor that’s helping me bring the characters to life and put all of this together.</p>
<p>Are you ready for that first chapter?  Great! And just so you know, as the contributions grow, I won’t leave you hanging. Once this campaign hits $2000, I’ll tease chapter 2. Then at $3000, I’ll tease chapter 3 and at $6000, I’ll introduce you to chapter four. Even a small donation such as $5, $10, or $25 can go a long way to reaching my goal.</p>
<p>Check out chapter 1 here. I hope you enjoy it! Please feel free to give me some feedback, positive or negative, it’s all good! <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JqP6oGf6qwWBo4FfdjEFM4IbutMGzohM/view?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JqP6oGf6qwWBo4FfdjEFM4IbutMGzohM/view?usp=sharing</a></p>

</div></div>","Summing it Up
Hi, my name is Joe Dell, and yes, I am an average Joe. Just a hard-working man with a few dreams. Telling stories has always been a passion of mine and I’m hoping you’ll join me on my journey and help me tell this story to the world.  
Fort Apollo tells of the story of five boys on the brink of adolescence; it follows them along their many adventures during the summer of 1969. This story follows the boys as they navigate the turbulent times at the end of the sixties in their own unique way. Their sense of adventure and imagination know no bounds and they get involved in one situation after another. Michael is the leader of this small band of friends, physically abused by his father and emotionally neglected by his mother. In a twist of fate a woman comes into his life. Sharon Gibbons has been exiled from her homeland in Ireland for a mistake that she will regret for the rest of her life, events so devastating it has caused her to lose her faith. Through Michael she meets Jim a decorated Vietnam veteran disillusioned since his return from war. He can't understand why he and his fellow veterans are treated so disrespectfully for simply serving their country. Can the three of them find a way to bury their pain and  and  begin to live a normal life? Sometimes life can be very hard.Broken souls,broken hearts and broken bones.

<p>I am a full-time writer for Consumer Media Network and a music and arts columnist for <a href=""http://houston.culturemap.com/author/chris_becker/articles/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CultureMap Houston</a>. I've written for the Houston Press, Option Magazine, and the contemporary classical music blog Sequenza 21.</p>
<p>I especially enjoy interviewing musicians from the world of jazz in all its forms and permutations. My column and personal blog has featured conversations with pianist Bobby Lyle, saxophonist Mindi Abair, singer Dee Dee Bridgewater, guitarist Russell Malone, conga maestro Poncho Sanchez, and New Orleans pianist Larry Sieberth, to name just a few. It was my conversation with Mindi Abair that sparked my idea to compile a collection of my interviews with women who play jazz in all of its forms. The working title of the book is <em>Women in Jazz</em>.</p>
<p>Some great musicians, including Mindi Abair, Jane Ira Bloom, Tia Fuller, and Pamela York have already agreed to be interviewed for the book. I plan to conduct at least 15 additional interviews for the book.</p>
<p>Does such a book currently exist? There are plenty of books about jazz featuring men, and it is a genre that, in spite of the groundbreaking advancements several notable women, is dominated by a male worldview. So what about the women composing for and directing big bands? Or shred with the best of them in the world of jazz-fusion? Or proudly play a kind of music that is a hybrid of styles and influences and called ""jazz"" just for the sake of a label?</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What I Need</span></p>
<p>Right now I have just a few interviews archived, and just beginning to contact more artists to see if they're agreeable to my interviewing them for the book.</p>
<p><strong>AS A FIRST STEP</strong> toward promoting the book project, building a community supportive of the concept, and connecting with potential interviewees, <strong>I want to create a short, six to seven minute, professional promotional video.</strong> The video will include audio excerpts from women I've already interviewed for the book, exclusive content from some of the interviewees publicists, and me describing the scope and timeline of the project. The video will be shot and edited by Jonathan Jindra, an extremely talented and gifted videographer whose work appears on his business website <a href=""http://www.binariumproductions.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Binarium Productions</a>.</p>
<p>The final cut will appear on a blog documenting the <em>Women In Jazz</em> project as it comes together. The blog will be regularly updated with news about the project and the participants, becoming a tool for promotion and future fundraising as well as a hub for people invested in jazz and the contributions of women to the music.</p>
<p>$1,000 will cover the costs of shooting and editing the video, which will include exclusive interview footage, creating special graphics, and crucially, for a video touting a project involving interviews with musicians, producing a professional soundtrack.</p>

<p>“Chris wrote music reviews for me when I re-launched the music and culture magazine Option as an online-only publication in 2010. I found him extremely knowledgeable of music ranging from pop to the farthest reaches of the avant-garde. He is easy to communicate with, a solid writer and thinker, an entertaining read, and he has an edge on other music writers — Chris is a composer of experimental music himself.” — Mark Kemp, Editor-in-Chief at Creative Loafing Charlotte, former Senior Music Editor at Rolling Stone magazine</p>
<p>“Chris’ work as a writer is the kind readers search for. He provides a compelling story as well as a back history when needed, mixed with attention to detail and unique dialogue. Most recently in his coverage of Dave Koz and Poncho Sanchez, Chris delivered pieces full of appeal and substance. It’s obvious Chris does his research and puts forth a notable story.” — Kelly Johanns-DiCillo, Tour Publicist at Concord Music Group</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Milton Milton Bradley, and I am a Licensed Fool who needs your help. I have plied my trade at both the Castle at Muskogee Oklahoma Renaissance Festival, the Whitehart Renaissance Festival and most recently at the Kansas City Renaissance Festival, where I was the featured player for the Bawdy Beer Show's ""Pub Poetry"" segment.</p>
<p>Why do I need you help? Well, it's simple -- I am putting together a compilation of my works, and that is not a cheap endeavor. However, if I do raise the requisite amount of funding, everyone who contributes at least $15 will get a copy of the finished CD and some other goodies, which I'll talk about below.</p>
<p>You won't just be helping some other struggling artist make just another of their many unheard albums -- in fact, you will be helping me in publishing my first album of bawdy poetry, dirty jokes and filthy sketches. If that last sentence made you uneasy, read the next paragraph. This CD will be my magnum opus -- you will finally be able to take me home with you AND get to me spew forth and shut up just by pressing a simple button. More personally, however, this will be a launching point for my routine, which is a type of vaudevillian entertainment that has been slowly dying out. If you want to help me in my personal struggle to keep this art-form alive, please consider contributing.</p>
<p>Now, if you're still reading this, you saw the part about how this is ""dirty"" poetry and jokes and whatnot.  Don't worry, I am an artist.  Even though it is R-rated filth, it is very carefully-worded and eloquent R-rated filth.  It's the kind of filth that you think: ""Wow.  That's some classy filth.""</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span><br/></p>
<p>I need $600. Simple as that. If everyone donates enough as if to purchase a CD ($15), then we only need 40 contributors. There are more ""rewards"" available, but we'll get to that later. The $600 will go to fees and processing of contributions and the production costs of the CD.  The majority of that will go toward CD printing/duplication, as that is the expensive part of it.</p>
<p>Now, as for the perks:</p>
<p><b>Contribute $1 </b>and you'll have my thanks.  </p>
<p>Every contribution will get a mention on my website, thanking you for your patronage.</p>
<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Contribute $5</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> and you'll get a custom-written limerick. You can tell me what you want the topic to be, or you can trust me as an artist to write something exceptionally vile just for you.  It will be delivered digitally.</span><br/></p>
<p><b>Contribute $10 </b>and you'll get a custom-written poem with your choice of subject matter, <b>or </b>a custom-written limerick with your choice of subject matter.  The poem will be delivered digitally, but the limerick can be written on parchment, hand-scribed in calligraphic font, and mailed to you anywhere in the US.</p>
<p><b>Contribute $15</b> and you'll get a CD. You'll also get a short-form poem, up to a page in length, waxing on a theme of your choosing, hand-scribed by my assistant in calligraphy on parchment paper. You'll also get thanked on my website. The poem and CD will be mailed together.</p>
<p><b>Contribute $25</b> and you'll get the CD, get a long-form poem (over a page in length), hand-scribed in calligraphy on parchment, special thanks on my website, and a mention on my CD insert.</p>
<p><b>Contribute $35</b> and you'll get <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">the CD, and instead of a normal poem, you'll get an finely crafted insult in rhyming meter.  I will send it digitally, both to you, and (at your discretion) to your ""target"". This is for entertainment; don't be a ponce about it.

My name is Milton Milton Bradley, and I am a Licensed Fool who needs your help. I have plied my trade at both the Castle at Muskogee Oklahoma Renaissance Festival, the Whitehart Renaissance Festival and most recently at the Kansas City Renaissance Festival, where I was the featured player for the Bawdy Beer Show's ""Pub Poetry"" segment.
Why do I need you help? Well, it's simple -- I am putting together a compilation of my works, and that is not a cheap endeavor. However, if I do raise the requisite amount of funding, everyone who contributes at least $15 will get a copy of the finished CD and some other goodies, which I'll talk about below.
You won't just be helping some other struggling artist make just another of their many unheard albums -- in fact, you will be helping me in publishing my first album of bawdy poetry, dirty jokes and filthy sketches. If that last sentence made you uneasy, read the next paragraph. This CD will be my magnum opus -- you will finally be able to take me home with you AND get to me spew forth and shut up just by pressing a simple button. More personally, however, this will be a launching point for my routine, which is a type of vaudevillian entertainment that has been slowly dying out. If you want to help me in my personal struggle to keep this art-form alive, please consider contributing.
Now, if you're still reading this, you saw the part about how this is ""dirty"" poetry and jokes and whatnot.  Don't worry, I am an artist.  Even though it is R-rated filth, it is very carefully-worded and eloquent R-rated filth.  It's the kind of filth that you think: ""Wow.  That's some classy filth.""
What We Need & What You Get
I need $600. Simple as that. If everyone donates enough as if to purchase a CD ($15), then we only need 40 contributors. There are more ""rewards"" available, but we'll get to that later. The $600 will go to fees and processing of contributions and the production costs of the CD.  The majority of that will go toward CD printing/duplication, as that is the expensive part of it.
Now, as for the perks:
Contribute $1 and you'll have my thanks.  
Every contribution will get a mention on my website, thanking you for your patronage.
Contribute $5 and you'll get a custom-written limerick. You can tell me what you want the topic to be, or you can trust me as an artist to write something exceptionally vile just for you.  It will be delivered digitally.
Contribute $10 and you'll get a custom-written poem with your choice of subject matter, or a custom-written limerick with your choice of subject matter.  The poem will be delivered digitally, but the limerick can be written on parchment, hand-scribed in calligraphic font, and mailed to you anywhere in the US.
Contribute $15 and you'll get a CD. You'll also get a short-form poem, up to a page in length, waxing on a theme of your choosing, hand-scribed by my assistant in calligraphy on parchment paper. You'll also get thanked on my website. The poem and CD will be mailed together.
Contribute $25 and you'll get the CD, get a long-form poem (over a page in length), hand-scribed in calligraphy on parchment, special thanks on my website, and a mention on my CD insert.
Contribute $35 and you'll get the CD, and instead of a normal poem, you'll get an finely crafted insult in rhyming meter.  I will send it digitally, both to you, and (at your discretion) to your ""target"". This is for entertainment; don't be a ponce about it. Along with the insult, you'll get mentioned in the CD (or, optionally, your ""victim"" will) and you and your victim will be thanked, personally, on my website.
Contribute $50 and you'll get one of everything from the categories of $35 and below: CD, Poetic Insult (in place of long-form poem), Short-form poem (custom theme), Limerick (custom theme), Thanks on the CD, Thanks on my website.
Contribute $60 and you'll get a CD, and a drinking song themed however you choose, to which I will write the melody, harmony, accompaniment and lyrics.  I will record the audio, set it to pictures of myself, and upload it to YouTube.  I will make a personalized thank you for the info section of the video, a personalized thank you on my website with the video link, and put you in the ""Special Thanks"" section of the CD insert.  I'd throw in punch and pie, but I'm not going to mail that to you.
If you are a musician - you will also get the rights to perform this song whenever you want, provided you say: ""The following song was written by Milton Milton Bradley"".  If you want the music, I can send you the chord sheet separately.  
Contribute $75 and you'll get a CD, plus you will get to choose the theme of a poem, which I will write, then record video of my recitation complete with a verbal thank you, citing your support by name, you will be listed in the special thanks in the info section of the video, you will get a personalized thank you on my website with a link to the video, and you will be listed in the ""Special Thanks"" OR
""THE GAUNTLET"" -- First, you'll get a CD.  Second, you'll get to throw down the gauntlet; I will write a full-length poem, and have it artistically assembled for you somehow (length-permitting, it will be decoupaged onto a frame).  But, beyond just picking the theme, you can give me a specific challenge, such as: ""Must contain 's' alliterations"" or ""must be in dactylic nonameter"".  You reserve the option of keeping the poem to yourself, or -- at your discretion -- I will take a picture and upload it to my website; either way, you'll get a personalized thank you on my website, and you'll be listed in the ""Special Thanks"" section of my CD insert.

Contribute $100 and you'll be actively involved in the writing process of a poem I create - you can give me a theme, any challenges, and any content you want added into it.  I will send you drafts and edits, and you get to approve them.  This poem will be recorded and put onto the CD with a verbal acknowledgement of your contributions in my introductory monologue.  You will be credited on the CD, and thanked on all of my social media sites and my website.
For legal purposes, I will retain all performance and reproduction rights to any artistic works we co-author as a result of this fundraising campaign.

Purchasing this option opens up stretch goal funding, so, you may get more if the campaign goes well, such as T-shirts, prints, and the like.
If I don't earn $600, I will take the money I do earn and put all of it toward the CD printing/duplication process, including whatever of my own funds I must, and the CD will be made, I'll just be a little poorer for a while.

</span></span>Territorial Aggression</p><p><br/><br/> </p><p><span>·<span> <br/></span></span>By Jason Brewster<br/><br/><br/><br/>Chapter one</p><p><br/><br/> </p><p><br/><br/></p> Being a
werewolf could be a pain, especially when your fiancé was human. Smiling to
himself, Brian pressed the end button of his cell phone. He thought about
calling his fiancé, Alyssa, but decided to surprise her. It wasn’t too often
that his “weekly Sunday meetings” were cancelled.<br/><br/><div>
His Alpha was out hunting tonight. There had been a couple mysterious
disappearances in the last week or two. Prior to these incidents, the last
thing the pack had dealt with was a lone vampire that intruded on their turf.
His pack controlled the area around Sarasota, Florida. Since the humans
couldn’t fend off the things that went bump in the night, the pack protected
the population of their territory.<br/><br/>
</div><div>his “normal” life he managed a warehouse off Clark Road. It supplied local
businesses with wholesale electronic components, golf cart parts, cooking
equipment, and a plethora of other things. Like all of the other packmates, he
worked for a company owned by Jonathon. He pulled his 69 Chevelle Malibu out of
the paking lot, looking forward to the coming evening<p><br/></p>
<p>Jonathon was the Alpha of the pack. Like wolves, the pack was controlled by the<br/>strongest member, and each pack had one Alpha. Brian had heard that other<br/>lycanthropes had different family structures, but that was only hearsay so far.<br/>The only other lycanthrope he’d ever met was a werepanther, Josh.<br/><br/>Josh had no pack, he ran solo. It didn’t seem to bother him, plus he had the<br/>wolves to back him up. Josh was an officer with the Sarasota police department.<br/>He was the reason the meeting had been called off. Not affiliated with a pack,<br/>he was a loner. He did share information with the pack and vice versa, which is<br/>what was happening tonight. He had something to discuss with Jonathon that<br/>couldn’t wait. Having a paranormal ally within the law enforcement system came<br/>in handy.<br/><br/>Asides from Josh, Sarasota hosted half a dozen strong psychics and two witch<br/>families. The only members of the families Brian had met were Margarete Armijo,<br/>who had dealings with the pack on occasion, and Roslyn McLeary, who was in the<br/>same class as him in high school. They had dated briefly, but there had been<br/>too much drama. Mostly it was her family not approving of her dating a<br/>werewolf.<br/><br/>Since Jonathon had called off the weekly meeting, Brian had decided to take<br/>Alyssa out to dinner. A bartender at Chili’s during the night, she attended the<br/>Ringling School of Art during the day. They barely had any time together, so it<br/>was a rare treat when they got to go out. Sometimes it just seemed as though<br/>they cohabitated in the same room. He’d fall asleep alone, and she’d wake up<br/>alone.<br/><br/>Maybe this would help prevent them from drifting apart, he thought<br/>optimistically. Of course, if they did drift apart it would solve the problem<br/>of keeping part of his life from the woman he loved, his mind countered.<br/>Pushing the thought from his mind, he tried to remain positive. He loved<br/>Alyssa, just as he loved being a garou (werewolf). If he had to keep the two<br/>separate, it was a small price to pay.<br/><br/>Brian was a pure bred, as were all of his packmates. The difference between<br/>other lycanthropes and a pure bred were simple. A pure bred was born that way<br/>and changed during the late stages of puberty, while an infected lycan changed<br/>after surviving an attack. Since lycanthropy, like vampirism, was kept out of<br/>mainstream science, the exact method of transmission was unknown. Although it<br/>was known that only an attack would spread the disease, it wasn’t transmitted<br/>sexually or by blood.<br/><br/>Asides from having to keep such a large part of his life a secret, he was<br/>content. It was an extremely delicate balance, but he believed he had the act<br/>down fairly well.<br/><br/>Calling a Brazilian steak house, the Rodizio Grill, he reserved a table under<br/>his full name, Brian Craft. Finished with that he turned up the stereo. His<br/>thoughts elsewhere, his eyes barely registered the sun soaked scenery as it<br/>flew by,<br/><br/>While garou had more longevity than humans, they were by no means immortal,<br/>like vampires. Being twenty-five Brian was just a pup. Thanks to lycan’s slower<br/>aging, he barely looked twenty. Most people who met him and his fiancé thought<br/>she was the older of the two, and she was only twenty-two.<br/><br/>They had been dating for five years, living together the past three. After his<br/>father had died when he was eighteen, she had been the only one who could calm<br/>his ensuing rage at the world. For two years he’d blown off her obvious<br/>concern, trying to drown his pain in drugs, alcohol, and violence. Being a<br/>garou, drugs and alcohol didn’t work as well as it did for humans. Plus, when<br/>you can heal broken bones in the space of ten minutes, it was hard to have<br/>enough pain inflicted upon him to mask the emotional distress he had felt.<br/><br/>Two years of her unwavering attention while he watched her mature into a<br/>beautiful young woman had done its damage. Unwittingly, he had become<br/>enraptured with her, despite his attempts to ignore her. Once their<br/>relationship had started, it had matured slowly.<br/><br/>The more he thought about it, the fact that it wasn’t a whirlwind of a<br/>relationship is probably what had helped hold it together. While most of their<br/>friends had loved and lost, their emotional bond had only grown stronger. He’d<br/>have thought that spending too much time together would be their downfall, but<br/>now the reverse worried him.<br/><br/>Pulling the green muscle car off of Clark road, he made a right onto Colonial<br/>Street. Passing the single story houses with their bright green, well kept<br/>yards, he pressed the garage door opener attached to the sun visor. The door<br/>opened before he came to the stop sign where Colonial met Williamsburg Street<br/>and ended. Driving the Chevelle through the slight jog to the left and up the<br/>driveway, he parked next to Alyssa’s white 2008 Mustang GT.<br/><br/>Pushing the garage door opener, he killed the large engine. He got out of the<br/>car, walking past the white washer and dryer and up the three steps to the door<br/>leading inside. Standing momentarily, he listened at the door. He could hear<br/>music playing and the sound, barely audible even to his extraordinary hearing,<br/>of pencil tip moving against paper.<br/><br/>Opening the door, he walked into the entryway and removed his shoes. The<br/>entryway was covered in white wallpaper with floral designs on it, a large<br/>mirror between the front and garage doors, the floor was polished hardwood. It<br/>wrapped around to the right to meet the front door, a small white wooden doored<br/>closet to the left. The wall between the living room and entryway was only<br/>seven feet high and didn’t extend to the ceiling. An open four foot rectangle<br/>cut into the wall connected the two instead of a door.<br/><br/>The living room was painted white, the carpet beige. Three of Alyssa’s<br/>paintings adorned the walls. There was also a forty-eight inch flat screen TV<br/>on a stand that held all the audio\visual electronics in it, a large beige pit<br/>group, and a wooden coffee table with four glass inserts in the top. Two thirds<br/>of the length of the room back, the carpet ended and the off white tile of the<br/>dining room began.<br/><br/>Centered to the breakfast bar, cut into the wall separating the kitchen and<br/>dining room, sat a brass and glass table with four black and brass chairs.<br/>Alyssa sat in the chair that faced the kitchen, with her back to the front<br/>door, and prismacolored drawings spread over the table around her. Her long<br/>blonde hair was braided in pigtails and swung as she turned to look over her<br/>shoulder. She was dressed in an old GWAR shirt of Brian’s and a pair of ripped<br/>blue jeans, her feet bare.<br/><br/>He could smell a faint tinge of fear on the air, mingling with her scent. As<br/>she saw him approach, a flitter of relief played across her face. “Hi babe, did<br/>you forget something?” She asked.<br/><br/>“No, something came up, so the meeting is cancelled.” He bent down and kissed her<br/>forehead. Standing erect, he looked into her vivid blue eyes. “So I made<br/>reservations at Rodizio’s for us.”<br/><br/>“Have you done something I should know about?” She teased him, smiling good<br/>naturedly.<br/><br/>The smile was infectious, and his face split into one. “No, little girl. I just<br/>thought we should take advantage of tonight.”<br/><br/>“Sounds great. How long until we’re supposed to be there?”<br/><br/>“Well, just in case you were doing something, I made the reservations for eight<br/>forty-five.”<br/><br/>“Silly boy, you know I don’t have anything going on. It’s the beginning of my<br/>weekend.”<br/><br/>“Hey, I never know. With my luck you’d have been out with friends till eight if<br/>I’d made the reservations for seven thirty. Plus, I wanted to get a workout in<br/>while I have a chance.”<br/><br/>Standing up, she gave him a hug. “Thanks, babe.”<br/><br/>“For what?” he asked with an arched brow.<br/><br/>“For being a loving, thoughtful boyfriend, and a little dense.” She winked at<br/>him surreptitiously.<br/><br/>He gave her a quick kiss. “Thanks, I think.” Leaving her to her artwork, he<br/>walked back through the living room and down the hallway to the right. The<br/>hallway led to the weight room, guestroom and guest bathroom.<br/><br/>Entering the second door on the right, he pulled off his polo shirt and khakis<br/>and put on the Miami Heat basketball shorts lying on the floor. Tossing the<br/>clothes in a pile by the door, he found the I-pod he kept in the room and<br/>inserted the ear pieces, putting the little machine on random. Lying down on<br/>the cool vinyl bench, he brought the barbell up off the stand. As Ministry began<br/>blaring in his ears he started to bench press the two hundred pounds he was<br/>holding.<br/><br/>Thankfully the altered healing factor of lycanthropes made it really difficult<br/>to blow up like Conan-era Arnold. It allowed them to gain tremendous strength<br/>without getting a huge physique. Although it took a conscious effort to have a<br/>soft touch, he thought as he pushed up another rep.<br/><br/>After about fifteen reps he began to sweat a little, showing no other signs of<br/>exertion. His breathing was timed to the reps, but he wasn’t huffing or<br/>panting. Even his face appeared relaxed as his mind continued to run amok.<br/><br/>The only things that a lycanthrope’s healing factor couldn’t deal with quickly<br/>were wounds caused by other lycan’s claws or teeth while in wereform, silver,<br/>and vampiric bites or claw wounds. It caused one to have a lower regard for<br/>personal safety. Although, normal bullets and blades could still kill a lycan<br/>if the head could be severed completely off, the brain destroyed or the lycan<br/>bled to death.<br/><br/>Of course, there was another side to all of it. You couldn’t just take a bullet<br/>to the chest in front of witnesses and walk away nonchalantly. There was a<br/>covenant that most lycans and vampires adhered to. Basically it said that all<br/>the supernatural dirt had to be done out of the public eye. Also, they could<br/>never reveal themselves to humans, not even family.<br/><br/>Brian almost laughed at the thought. Yeah, hey guys, sorry to inform you, but<br/>your bloodline is tainted with a disease that only shows up once every couple<br/>thousand births. Oh, and I have it. Yeah, it makes me change into the wolfman.<br/>No seriously.<br/><br/>The downside was that he would never be able to tell Alyssa about it. He’d have<br/>to cringe in mock fear if some punk ever pulled a gun on them. When what he’d<br/>really want to do is stomp a hole in him. Then again it was all conjecture.<br/>Point was, he would always be lying. He couldn’t stop being a garou, and he<br/>wouldn’t give up Alyssa. No matter how much nay saying they had done.<br/><br/>He could still remember when the little fourteen year old punk girl hit the<br/>scene in Sarasota. Little did he realize, he’d later think of the event as<br/>divine intervention. She had just moved with her parents from Kingman, Az. For<br/>reasons he still couldn’t fathom, she had been drawn to him like a moth to flame.<br/><br/>Not the typical teenager in anyway, he had fended off the young girls<br/>inexplicable attraction to him, while his friends his age had dated girls as<br/>young as her or younger. As much as he’d blown her off, she had blown his<br/>friends off twice as much, he thought with a rueful smile. Guess that proves<br/>she wasn’t like other girls her age. Most of them were so starved for affection<br/>that they weren’t without a boyfriend for more than a couple days at a time.<br/><br/>Then his father had succumbed to cancer, and Brian got a glimpse of what his<br/>future was to be like. Living longer than his human counterparts, he would be<br/>forced to watch everyone he knew or loved die. Lo and behold, the young Brian<br/>had rebelled. It was funny, no amount of normal teenage angst could cause said<br/>rebellion. Life had been too new and full of surprises. He’d only found out he<br/>was a garou two and a half years before it happened.<br/><br/>He’d quickly gained the reputation of being a quick tempered, heavy drinking,<br/>drug gobbling badass. He rarely lost a fight, even when he was jumped. As far<br/>as he was concerned the covenant could be damned. The only beatings he took<br/>were administered by his packmates.<br/><br/>Jonathon had especially taken offense to his attitude. Of his two pack<br/>enforcers, Matt had been the more sympathetic. His “lessons” had been geared<br/>more towards future conflict, while Jack’s (the other pack enforcer) and<br/>Jonathon’s had been straight punishment, meant as an attitude adjustments.<br/><br/>Yet none of that could dent the huge amount of rage he’d felt, nothing but one<br/>little seventeen year old girl. He could still remember that fateful evening<br/>with crystal clarity.<br/><br/>It had been a weekend night towards the end of summer. Brian had been aimless<br/>since graduation two years prior. His employment by Jonathon was wearing thin.<br/>More often than not, he found himself getting a lesson from one or more of his<br/>packmates instead of actually working at the warehouse. So, in typical weekend<br/>fashion, he found himself at the Blue Parrot bar catching a punk show and<br/>blowing off steam.<br/><br/>The Parrot was a great venue that had closed down later. It’d had all ages<br/>shows and served alcohol. People usually had to go north to Tampa-St. Pete to<br/>find that. The only drawback of the bar was its tiny layout. It was only twenty<br/>feet across and eighty feet back, not including the backstage area. Coming from<br/>the front door, about forty feet of space was taken up by tables and the bar<br/>that ran along the wall to the right. Behind the bar, stairs ran up to the<br/>second floor that over looked the bar and was filled with couches and little<br/>tables.<br/><br/>The stage only took up twelve feet and was elevated just a few inches above the<br/>floor. The rest of the space was taken up by the pit area which had two support<br/>beams in it. The two foot across square concrete posts had been known to be<br/>hazardous to people’s health, especially when the pit was rambunctious, as it<br/>was on this evening. Brian manhandled his way through it, bouncing off people<br/>and slamming others at random.<br/><br/>He had discovered that lsd was one of the only drugs his souped up metabolism<br/>couldn’t pump out quickly, so he’d eaten a few hits on top of a lot of<br/>Jagermeister and a bit of nose candy. The aggressive tempo of the music was<br/>bringing him closer and closer to a frenzy.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the song, he began to batter the other people in the pit. A<br/>well placed punch here, an elbow there, shoulder check that guy into a support<br/>post, and rebound with an elbow to some guys face. He flew around, concentrated<br/>mayhem on a destruction mission.<br/><br/>Walking out of the pit to the bar when the song ended, he ordered a Bud Lite<br/>draft. Upending the glass, he slammed the beer before leaving the empty mug on<br/>the bar and sauntering outside. In contrast to the stifling club filled with<br/>hot, sweaty bodies, the night air was crisp and refreshing, with a slight<br/>chill.<br/><br/>Greedily, he sucked in large gulps of fresh air. There was a motley collection<br/>of punks, skins, and scenesters hanging around the entrance and the bench<br/>located on the side walk by the road. He nodded to a group of his old friends<br/>that included Alyssa.<br/><br/>Her hair was dyed orange with black tips that night. She had let it down for<br/>once. Wearing white knee high stockings with short oxblood Doc Martin boots, a<br/>plaid skirt and a black Against All Authority tank top, she was quite a<br/>fetching sight. She stared him in the eyes, unnerving him slightly.<br/><br/>It wasn’t that she wasn’t attractive, or that he had a problem approaching<br/>women, he just didn’t see her in that light yet. All he was after was the<br/>conquests. Although he wouldn’t admit it, he cared for her too much to use and<br/>discard her. Plus, she was immature compared to the women he went after. His<br/>new found confidence had given him access to older women, including the<br/>bartender that was serving him even though he was underage.<br/><br/>Watching the faces of the young kids around him distort and melt, he didn’t pay<br/>attention as four guys came out of the bar behind him. Their voices floating up<br/>from the doorway also didn’t register with his acid soaked mind.<br/><br/>“Is that the asshole from the pit?”<br/><br/>“Yeah, that’s him.”<br/><br/>“Hey! You!” The yelling caused him to turn around, a fist caused him to spin<br/>back. Having been sucker punched brought him out of his stupor and straight<br/>into attack mode. He was like a pitbull that had been fed black powder.<br/><br/>Landing a solid hook to his attacker, he knocked out the first of the four.<br/>Before the guy could hit the sidewalk, Brian followed up with a straight right<br/>into the guy’s nose, adding insult to injury.<br/><br/>Out of his peripheral vision, he saw one of his old friends, Cory, stalking the<br/>other three. His hand was about to go into the pocket of his leather jacket,<br/>where Brian knew he carried brass knuckles. The thought that someone was going<br/>to try to save him made him smile.<br/><br/>“Cory, don’t. I’ve got this,” he said, still smiling maniacally.<br/><br/>His friend stared at him incredulously, shrugging. The mixture of the lunatic<br/>grin, the confidence he exuded, and the fact he’d just called off the only help<br/>he had caused the remaining three attackers to hesitate.<br/><br/>Jumping on the opportunity, Brian slammed an elbow into the jaw of the attacker<br/>closest to him. He went down in a heap, and Brian heard the sound of Mario<br/>collecting a gold coin in the video game Super Mario Bros. Before the next guy<br/>could lift his arms, his face had already been stuffed with three quick,<br/>powerful punches. With every hit, the coin sound played in Brian’s head.<br/><br/>The last guy standing had gathered the presence of mind to run. The smell of<br/>his fear excited Brian even more. Before the poor guy could run a dozen steps,<br/>he was spun around and headbutted viciously, twice.<br/><br/>Brian lost it. He began screaming as he held up his slack body with one hand.<br/>The other hand punctuated each word with a brutal punch. “Try to jump me, huh?<br/>Who do you think you are? Four on one, huh?” He started slamming his fist into<br/>the jelly that had been the guy’s face with every syllable. “Bad fucking<br/>mistake, asshole.”<br/><br/>Lost in the moment, he didn’t hear the diminutive voice behind him. “Brian,<br/>please.” But he did feel the hand on his shoulder when she placed it there to<br/>stop him.<br/><br/>He dropped his victim and spun around, snatching Alyssa up by her neck with one<br/>hand. His right hand pistoned back to start battering his newest target. His<br/>face was twisted in a mask of hatred and rage.<br/><br/>His mind recoiled at the fear, compassion, worry, and love etched on the face<br/>of the beautiful girl he was about to pound into a bloody mess of broken bone<br/>and flesh. Everything stopped, and the walls of hate and rage he had built<br/>around the grief for his father came crashing down.<br/><br/>Letting go of her, a single tear ran from his eye. His acid soaked brain began<br/>to make connections. He had never truly grieved for his father, just covered it<br/>up. He actually loved the little girl in front of him, and she really, truly<br/>loved him.<br/><br/>Turning off his memories, he set the bar back on its stand with a mighty heave.<br/>Although the memories were a great motivator when working out, that part always<br/>drained him. He laid there, his sweat turning cool, as he felt the torn muscles<br/>repairing themselves.<br/><br/>After a couple of minutes, he got up and started doing military benches,<br/>reminiscing again. He thought of how happy the pack had been when he finally<br/>came around. Until they found out the reason, that was.<br/><br/>Smiling, he wondered why, when everything they had said to him to calm him had<br/>bounced right off, they suddenly thought their advice would stick. None of them<br/>understood why he choose would the hassle of a permanent human mate. Jonathon<br/>was convinced he would betray the covenant at first. Matt continually extolled<br/>the virtues of a garou mate. Which he would, being mated to Sarah, who was<br/>another packmate. At the time she was the only other female in the pack.<br/><br/>Over the years they had grown to know and accept her. Jonathon was the sole<br/>holdout, but it didn’t seem to matter that the owner of a business was aloof<br/>around his manager’s fiancé. Matt and Sarah had become their best friends, as<br/>far as couples were concerned. There were still the occasional prophetic<br/>doomsday comments, but Brian thought they had decided to let him live his own<br/>life.<br/><br/>Lifting the small forty pound dumbbell over his head for the umpteenth time, he<br/>ruminated that it was probably a lot easier not trying to tell him how to live<br/>now that he’d quit being such a jerk. Plus there weren’t many possible<br/>repercussions for the pack. He was only messing up his own life.<br/><br/>Her family had actually put up more of a fight than his pack had. To them,<br/>Brian had no future, or at least not one good enough for Alyssa. It hadn’t<br/>helped that his reputation preceded him to the point where both her younger<br/>sisters and older brother knew of him, none of it good. He’d even had to<br/>swallow his pride and not retaliate when her brother had sucker punched him.<br/><br/>In his opinion, they still didn’t believe he was good enough for her, but at<br/>least they had quit trying to pull them apart. It probably had a lot to do with<br/>her blowing them off after the incident with her brother. Brian still felt<br/>pride at the amount of self restraint he had shown that day. He knew Alyssa was<br/>very proud that he had kept his cool. His relationship with her brother, Josh,<br/>was barely amicable to this day.<br/><br/>Where once he had felt nothing could come between them, now budding seeds of<br/>doubt began to bloom. While his rational mind knew it was only the amount of<br/>time spent apart, he couldn’t quell the feeling of unease he’d begun to have.<br/>As soon as he had let any doubt in, it had begun to eat at him.<br/><br/>Well hopefully tonight will help put some of that to rest, he thought. It was<br/>definitely good luck that had brought him this opportunity. He knew he should<br/>just blow off the irrational thoughts, but it was more easily said than done.<br/>He blew out a heavy sigh, pumping out three more reps before changing exercises<br/>again.<br/><br/>As he started doing single curls, alternating hands, he tried to clear his<br/>mind. Dwelling on the subject just gave it more sustenance, which was the last<br/>thing he needed to do. Instead, he focused on the music pouring into his ears.<br/>Timing his reps to coincide with the rhythm, he zoned out.<br/><br/>Finishing up, he replaced all the weights and the I-pod to their prearranged<br/>spots. Leaving the room, he switched off the lights. He strode into the living<br/>room on his way to the master bedroom. Alyssa was hunched over one of her<br/>drawings, lost to the world, her colored pencil a blur. Other drawings still<br/>lay on the glass dining room table, an arch of art around her.<br/><br/>The picture she was working on reminded Brian of a bad acid trip. It was one of<br/>her few darker pieces, an expedition into her subconscious. It was kind of<br/>post-apocalyptic; a burnt, melted cityscape with half decomposed bodies lying<br/>in the street that made up the foreground.<br/><br/>Even with that subject, the picture had beauty. The sky was a pink and purple<br/>sunset. The colors reflected off the towering lumps of melted glass that had<br/>once been skyscrapers. Plus, he noted, the detail was amazing.<br/><br/>The door to the master bedroom was off the dining room. Moving stealthily, he<br/>retreated through it and closed the door softly. He didn’t want to ruin her<br/>concentration. Stripping off the shorts he went straight for the master<br/>bathroom. Padding over cool tile, he moved quietly to the shower and turned it<br/>on. Stepping into the small room of a shower, he let the water sluice the sweat<br/>and dirt from his body. He luxuriated in the hot spray.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Chapter two<br/><br/>The dinner had gone well, and Brian was looking forward to taking his fiancé<br/>home. He could tell from her scent and body language that she was anticipating<br/>what would follow when they got there.<br/><br/>Walking out of the Rodizio Grill, Brian caught the faint scent of an unfamiliar<br/>garou in werewolf form. He didn’t even recognize the garou’s bloodline, but<br/>could tell it wasn’t an Alpha or a pure bred. Inhaling deeply through his nose,<br/>he could tell the garou was actually a fair distance away. He realized that if<br/>the balmy wind hadn’t been from the southwest, he would never have caught the<br/>scent.<br/><br/>“You alright, babe?” Alyssa asked looking at him with a puzzled expression on<br/>her beautiful face, her head cocked slightly to one side. Brian looked down<br/>then swept his gaze up from her black stiletto heels, over the creamy expanse<br/>of leg, over the small black cocktail dress that clung to her body. He tried to<br/>imprint the picture to his memory, knowing he couldn’t stay with her now.<br/><br/>“Sorry, baby. I’ve got a lot of shit on my mind. I think it’d be better if I<br/>walk back to the house. Just to clear my head.” Although lying to her was<br/>almost painful, he could see no way around it. This part of his life would<br/>always be a secret.<br/><br/>“What’s wrong?” She stepped closer to him, the scent of her perfume mingled<br/>with the unique musk that was all her own and filled his nostrils.<br/><br/>“It’s just from shit from work. I’m sorry, baby, but I won’t be worth a damn<br/>till I figure this out. I’m still coming home, I promise. I just need this.” He<br/>didn’t know what else to say, and he was afraid if he waited much longer, he’d<br/>lose the scent.<br/><br/>Leveling her head and frowning slightly, she answered, “If you say so. Try not<br/>to be too long, ok?”<br/><br/>Nodding, Brian watched her walk to her Mustang, his eyes fixated on her ass<br/>through the thin material of her dress. For a split second he forgot about the<br/>other garou, but he caught the faint scent once again on the humid night air.<br/>He cursed the sacrifices he was sometimes forced to make, turning and walking<br/>away as Alyssa got into her car.<br/><br/>Once out of her sight, he moved quickly. Leaving the Gulf Gate business<br/>district, he started passing one story suburban homes. Reaching into the gray<br/>slacks he realized he had left his cell phone at home. While it was a fortunate<br/>mistake if Alyssa tried to call him, it meant he couldn’t inform his packmates.<br/>He was going in solo. Nearing the garou’s location, he began searching for a<br/>deserted house or yard. His hazel eyes lit upon a for sale sign a couple houses<br/>down.<br/><br/>Walking down the street, he watched the houses and yards for any sign of being<br/>watched. He saw no one, and the little white house appeared vacant. Walking<br/>towards up the concrete drive, he sniffed the air. He was still downwind of the<br/>garou and there were no canines in the vicinity.<br/><br/>Some dogs acted weird around garou in human form, although most were<br/>frightened. When a dog was around a garou changing shape, they went nuts. It<br/>was the kind of attention he had to avoid.<br/><br/>He hurdled the three foot chain link fence without breaking stride, darting<br/>into the shadows. Once in the shelter of the dark backyard, he stripped<br/>quickly. Folding the grey slacks, black button up shirt and boxers, he put them<br/>on top of his shoes on the small wooden deck.<br/><br/>Taking a deep breath, he forced himself to change. His back arched as pain<br/>ripped through him. His five foot eleven inch frame began to grow, light brown<br/>fur rippling over his body. There was an audible crack as his facial bones<br/>shifted to allow a snout to flow forward. Two more followed as his knees popped<br/>backwards. Moonlight glinted off of his teeth as they grew past his lips, a<br/>twisted grimace on his flowing face. Thirty seconds after the change had<br/>started, it was over. He breathed a sigh of relief as the pain receded.<br/><br/>He bounded over the fence and into drainage ditch, running towards where the<br/>scent originated from. He let himself go, tearing through palmetto bushes,<br/>reveling in the physical sensations of his muscles uncoiling and the wind in<br/>his fur.<br/><br/>Seemingly no sooner than he had started to run, he was behind the house the<br/>garou was in, looking through the back sliding glass door. Seeing no movement<br/>inside the living room, he used his advanced senses to try and ascertain what<br/>was going on. His pulse quickened as he scented fear and blood. A low moan of<br/>anguish was barely audible.<br/><br/>He launched himself though the glass door, avoiding the white leather furniture<br/>and little wooden coffee table. Landing on the thick white shag carpeting, he<br/>rolled to his feet and ran into the short hallway to the right. The second door<br/>on the left was slightly ajar, the assaulting stench of fear, anguish, and<br/>human blood wafting from it.<br/><br/>Bounding towards the door, he stopped two feet from it and pushed it open<br/>gently, beware of a trap. Rage boiled inside of him at the sight that greeted<br/>his eyes.<br/><br/>It was apparent that the huge black garou hadn’t heard the glass breaking; he<br/>was so intent on ravaging his victim. Splatters of blood randomly sprayed the<br/>white walls and ceiling crimson. The large beast had its claws and teeth sunk<br/>into the body on the brass frame bed. Sheets black with blood dripped onto the<br/>carpet staining it red.<br/><br/>Brian launched himself at the beast’s bared back, taking advantage of his<br/>opponent’s inattention. He clamped his teeth into its right shoulder, sinking<br/>his claws into the left shoulder and right bicep. The huge size of the garou<br/>was even more apparent once he was latched on. Brian’s rear claws were two feet<br/>off the ground, tearing at the back of his adversary’s legs as he scrambled to<br/>find some grip. He flexed his jaw muscles, trying to shatter the huge beast’s<br/>collarbone or separate it’s rotator cuff.<br/><br/>His opponent reacted, seizing him by the neck and flinging him across the room.<br/>The action caused Brian to rip chunks from the garou’s shoulders. Brian flew<br/>into the stained cedar dresser opposite the door to the hall. The force of the<br/>impact drove the dresser into the drywall breaking it and cracking the studs<br/>behind it.<br/><br/>Jumping up, Brain faced the huge black beast. Blood ran from both shoulders<br/>matting the fur. The right shoulder and arm were worse wounds than the left<br/>shoulder, but none of the wounds seemed like enough to even slow his opponent<br/>down. Brian spit the mouthful of flesh and fur on the carpet. Doing so was an<br/>insult by garou customs. Basically, he just said he had no respect and nothing<br/>to fear from him. As his adversary came around the bed between them, Brian<br/>improved his stance, settling his weight on the balls of his feet.<br/><br/>In a blur of superhuman speed the massive black beast rushed him, swinging<br/>wildly. Brian ducked under a right and sidestepped. He raked his claws across<br/>its abdomen, opening four wounds. The garou whirled, cracking him in the side<br/>of the head with a spinning back fist.<br/><br/>His adversary tried to press the advantage, throwing a powerful right haymaker.<br/>Ducking underneath, he stepped closer to the garou, smothering its power. He<br/>slammed a left elbow into its solar plexus, following up with a right elbow to<br/>the snout. Brian was grabbed and tossed into the wall to the right. The garou<br/>shook his head to clear it before lunging at Brian again.<br/><br/>He hit the wall, bounced to the floor, rolled and came up crouched, white<br/>drywall dust in his fur. Using his legs to explode forward, he met the garou in<br/>the air. Its momentum was too much to overcome, and they ended up on the floor.<br/>Brian was on his back below the beast, barely holding its snapping maw from his<br/>face and neck.<br/><br/>Wrapping its hands around Brian’s neck, the garou started squeezing, choking<br/>him. He moved his hold off the beast so that he was gripping the upper and<br/>lower jaws and began to wrench them apart. His adversary grunted and released<br/>the strangle hold, allowing Brian to twist around to his hands and knees. The<br/>garou blasted the back of his head with a flurry of punches, only stopping to<br/>wrap him in a bear hug as Brian stood up.<br/><br/>Pretending to struggle, he jockeyed his left foot behind the beast. Bending his<br/>right knee, he swept his opponents foot forward as he snapped his right leg<br/>straight, pushing the garou over on his back and landing on top of it. The<br/>impact sent the air rushing from the beast’s lungs, causing it to loosen the<br/>bear hug. Brian used the slight break to twist around and lunge up, freeing his<br/>arms. Using short quick swipes, he started raking his claws down its face.<br/><br/>The beast released the hold of Brian’s abdomen to grab his wrists. Brian<br/>lowered his snout and snapped a little chunk of flesh from its chest. Once<br/>again he spit the mouthful out, this time in its face. Wrestling with the garou<br/>he finally pinned its left arm under his right knee.<br/><br/>He began to rain punishment down on his opponent, alternating punches, elbow<br/>strikes, facial slashes, and when no other opening presented itself, he slashed<br/>its right shoulder and arm. The massive garou bucked until it freed its arm,<br/>spinning to its hands and knees.<br/><br/>Brian was ready for this and ran his claws down its back before putting some<br/>distance between them. He watched the beast warily as it whirled around to face<br/>him once again. Blood ran from more than a dozen wounds.<br/><br/>He knew the only reason he wasn’t dead yet was because his adversary was<br/>relying on brute force instead of skill and experience. He also noted that the<br/>garou fought as a human would, not like a werewolf should. He thanked his lucky<br/>stars the beast wasn’t properly trained.<br/><br/>Deciding to play with it a little, he assumed a boxer’s stance and asked, “Hey<br/>Fido, does your Alpha know you’re attacking humans.” His voice was distorted<br/>from speaking through a snout, and it was lower due to changed vocal chords.<br/><br/>The huge garou gave a throaty laugh. “Stupid pup, this is a recruitment.” It<br/>swung a wild right haymaker.<br/><br/>Ducking under the blow, he slammed a right to the body followed by a left hook<br/>to its face. The garou stumbled back two steps and threw a left hook. Circling<br/>to his right, Brian caught the punch and blasted a hard jab into its snout.<br/><br/>The beast howled in rage, grabbing Brian and tossing him into the wall above<br/>the dresser once again. Drywall and studs broke as he went into and through the<br/>wall, landing on the beige tile of the master bathroom.<br/><br/>Rising to his feet, he looked back at the master bedroom through the hole in<br/>the wall. The garou tossed the dresser to the side and kicked the lower part of<br/>the wall in. Gripping the hole in the wall on either side, it ripped the wall<br/>down, enlarging the hole.<br/><br/>Brian ripped the porcelain sink from the wall as the beast broke a stud, making<br/>room for it to fit through. Water gushed from the broken pipes, drenching him<br/>as the garou entered the bathroom. Gripping the sink in his left hand he<br/>feinted a strike with it. His adversary went to block and Brian ripped his<br/>right claw across its stomach. He ducked a wild right and smashed the sink<br/>across its head opening a large gash along the side of it. The chunk of the<br/>sink in his right hand protruded about five inches from his closed fist,<br/>tapering into a curved point. Brian then had to eat a left hook in order to<br/>land an overhand right of his own.<br/><br/>Ducking another wild right, he slammed the makeshift porcelain shank into the<br/>garou’s exposed stomach. As Brian sank it into the beast’s stomach again it<br/>grabbed him by his right shoulder with its left hand and slammed a vicious<br/>right into his face. He saw a bright flash of white light before the powerful<br/>blow knocked him into a punch drunk daze. His adversary laughed with a deep<br/>rumbling sound.<br/><br/>Even a little out of it, he knew that he wouldn’t survive if he took many more<br/>of these powerful blows. If he were to be knocked unconscious, the beast could<br/>kill him at its leisure. Watching its right fist as the garou drew back for the<br/>next blow, desperation took hold in Brian. Before the fist could streak towards<br/>him again he jammed the makeshift shank into the underside of the beast’s jaw.<br/>It yelped in surprise and Brian opened his hand, slamming his palm into the<br/>porcelain to drive it deeper.<br/><br/>The garou released its grip and howled in anguish, reaching for it’s wounded<br/>snout with both hands. Brian blasted a right hook into its face then slashed it<br/>with his left claw. Keeping the momentum going he popped two quick jabs into<br/>its wounded snout before catching the chunk of porcelain with a right uppercut.<br/><br/>Brian pressed his advantage, slowly walking the garou back, out of the<br/>bathroom, hitting it with quick straight strikes. Once he had it backed<br/>sufficiently into the master bedroom, he began to circle to his right.<br/>Switching from knuckles to claws, he continued his vicious attack. The large<br/>garou bellowed, pulling the chunk of porcelain from its snot. His chest, stomach,<br/>and arms were a mess of bleeding slashes.<br/><br/>Brian ducked its attempt to imbed the chunk into his face, stepping in and<br/>sinking his right claws into its stomach almost to the first knuckle. He did<br/>the same with to the garou’s right calf. Sinking his teeth into its hamstrings,<br/>he attempted to hobble the giant.<br/><br/>Once again Brian found himself hurtling through the hole in the wall. This time<br/>the impact cracked drywall, cinderblock, and shattered the mirror above where<br/>the sink had been. He landed in a puddle, water cascading onto him.<br/><br/>He pushed himself to his feet, spitting the newest chunk of flesh onto the wet<br/>tiles. Peering through ten hole, he expected the huge garou to follow him into<br/>the bathroom, Instead the bedroom was abandoned, the door to the hall still<br/>swinging.<br/><br/>Brian shook himself, spraying the bathroom with the water in his fur before<br/>bounding after his opponent. He stayed low, running on all fours to avoid any<br/>possible ambushes. Not spotting his prey in the hall, he ran into the living<br/>room. As he rounded the corner, he found the coffee table sailing through the<br/>air at him.<br/><br/>He took the impact on his forearms, deflecting the table to the left, rising,<br/>his arms raised to block the next attack. Once his line of sight was clear of<br/>flying furniture, he saw the large garou disappear into the drainage ditch.<br/><br/>He started towards the broken sliding glass door to follow before thinking<br/>better of it. He padded back into the bedroom, creeping up to the bed. The<br/>bloody mess on the bed was still breathing. Walking back into the living room,<br/>he searched until he found a Thrasher magazine with the address on it. Finding<br/>a phone in the kitchen, he dialed a number from memory. It took two attempts of<br/>hitting the buttons with his claws.<br/><br/>“Hello?’ A female answered.<br/><br/>“Hey Sarah, can I yell at Matt? It’s Brian.”<br/><br/>“Umm, yeah, just a sec,” she said, puzzlement evident in her voice.<br/><br/>After a couple moments Matt came on the line. “Hey bro, what’s up?”<br/><br/>“Sorry to bother you, but I have a problem. I need you to come to…” Brian<br/>looked at the address and recited it.<br/><br/>“OK, what’s goin on?”<br/><br/>“I’ve got an attack survivor. I fought off the garou, and I need you to look<br/>after this kid.”<br/><br/>“Fuck. Did you tell Jonathon?”<br/><br/>“Nope. I was hoping you could fill him in. I’m on this guy’s landline, and Jonathon<br/>would kill me if I called his phone,” Brian explained.<br/><br/>“Yeah, you’ve gotta point. I’ll be there as soon as possible.”<br/><br/>“Thanks.” The line was already dead.<br/><br/>He crept warily back into the bedroom, surveying the extent of the damage to<br/>the person in the bloody bed. The victim was severely ravaged most of the<br/>muscle and flesh of the right leg was gone. Both of his forearms, chest, face,<br/>and left bicep were also torn asunder. Checking the victim’s vitals, Brian<br/>realized two things in quick succession. First, the victim was male. The second<br/>realization was that the guy had fallen into a lycanthropic healing coma, and<br/>the wounds were already beginning to close.<br/><br/>Brian didn’t know much about infected victims, but it didn’t seem normal for<br/>someone so recently infected to be able to enter a healing sleep already. He<br/>shook his head. Keeping his senses alert for the return of his opponent, he<br/>began to clean up.<br/><br/>He wrapped the young male’s worst wounds with what little bedding wasn’t<br/>already soaked in blood. Once the guy was situated as well as could be, he<br/>waded through the destruction of the bathroom. Finding the water shut off<br/>valve, he stopped the water cascading onto the tiles. Searching the small room<br/>for garbage bags, he came up empty.<br/><br/>Checking on the victim, he found the kid’s pulse stronger, his breathing less<br/>shallow and irregular. Satisfied the kid would be alright, he proceeding<br/>through the house to the kitchen. He stopped in the living room, taking in a<br/>deep breath of warm night air coming in through the broken sliding glass door.<br/>There was no trace of any garou scents.<br/><br/>Rifling through drawers and cabinets, he came upon some hefty bags. He carried<br/>his find back into the bedroom, remaining in were form incase the garou from<br/>earlier came back. Since he had no weapons, it seemed like the best idea.<br/><br/>Gathering the bloody remains of the bedding, he bagged it. Using his claws, he<br/>cut the blood soaked carpet. Shouldering the bed out of his way, he collected<br/>the carpet scraps and bagged them also. Finished with that, he looked about for<br/>the porcelain shank from earlier. After an exhaustive search of the bed and<br/>bath rooms came up with nothing, he broadened his search to the other rooms. He<br/>finally located the chunk in the living room, lying on the carpet by the couch.<br/><br/>He was about to go back into the bed room when he caught the sound of an engine<br/>coming down the quiet suburban street. The noise grew closer, headlights<br/>lighting the room as the vehicle swung into the drive.<br/><br/>Brian bounded to the window, using one claw to raise a blind. He was rewarded<br/>with the sight of Matt’s battered grey Silverado running in the drive. The<br/>wiry, brown skinned male in his apparent mid twenties was Brian’s packmate.<br/>Matt ran his hand over his short cropped black hair, sniffing the air. He was<br/>dressed as usual in climbing boots, jeans, and a black t-shirt<br/><br/>Brian realized he’d been holding his breath and released it. He unlocked the<br/>front door then moved back out of view as Matt walked up. In the pack hierarchy<br/>he was immediately above Brian, and was his closest confidant.<br/><br/>“Come in.” Brian said in a normal volume. Matt walked in, quickly shutting the<br/>door. Brian continued, “Sorry to interrupt your evening.’<br/><br/>Matt cracked his trademark, devil may cry smile. “Don’t worry about it, got me<br/>out of the house.”<br/><br/>“Please tell me you brought some firepower?”<br/><br/>“Of course,” Matt replied, pulling a Desert Eagle .357 from the waist band of<br/>his jeans.<br/><br/>Brian’s were form rippled as the fur retracted into the body as it shrank back<br/>to human. His naked body was completely clean. Even the scent of the other<br/>Garou was gone. Taking the pistol from Matt, he hefted the reassuring weight,<br/>smiling. His left hand still held the chunk of porcelain.<br/><br/>Matt’s smile never faltered. “So what the fuck happened?’<br/><br/>Shaking his head, Brian began his summary. While he related the story, he led<br/>Matt back into the bedroom. Matt’s brown eyes quickly took in the scene,<br/>darting over the damage to the room, the two black trash bags, and settling on<br/>the victim’s still form. As the two moved closer to the bed, Matt’s smile<br/>faded.<br/><br/>“The damage was worse. He’s fallen into a regenerative coma,” Brian observed.<br/><br/>“Fuck,” Matt said with a shrug of his shoulders, “it’s better than a body.<br/>Still, Jonathon is going to be pissed.”<br/><br/>Brian pulled his gaze from the young male’s slowly healing wounds, looking up<br/>into Matt’s face. “Did you talk to him?”<br/><br/>Matt’s smile returned. “Left that for Sarah. You want to talk about pissed.”<br/><br/>“Shit, so you don’t know what the plan is?”\<br/><br/>“I talked to her on the way over. I’m taking our friend here to Carlos’s house.<br/>We’re all meeting up at the warehouse early in the morning. I guess Josh had<br/>some bad news.”<br/><br/>“Yeah, I bet it has something to do with this. And what the fuck is early?”<br/><br/>“Around six. What time do you start opening?”<br/><br/>“Seven, so that should be fine. How do you want to do this?” Brian motioned to<br/>the inert body they were standing next to.<br/><br/>“Fuck, I wish Jonathon was here.” Matt paused before starting back up. “Wrap<br/>him in a blanket, toss him in the cab. I guess.”<br/><br/>“You mind doing that while I find some clothes and pack him a bag?”<br/><br/>“No problem.” Matt started searching for a comforter, Brian having already<br/>bagged the bloody one.</p>
<p><br/><br/>He walked through the debris back into the<br/>bedroom, wiping his feet on the carpet to clean them off. Matt was rolling the<br/>body in a green comforter, while Brian scoured the closet. Finding an old gym<br/>bag, he filled it with clothes.<br/><br/>Selecting a pair of ripped jeans that would fit his waist and an old flannel<br/>shirt, he put them on. He stuffed the .357 into the waistband and rolled up the<br/>excess of the long jeans. He then slipped on a pair of Nike’s that were too<br/>large for him, tossing a newer pair in the bag.<br/><br/>Shouldering the gym bag, he snatched up the two garbage bags and strode out of<br/>the house. Matt cradled the blanket swathed young man and followed. Brian<br/>tossed the bags into the truck, while Matt stuck the motionless body into the<br/>cab.<br/><br/>Matt closed the passenger door softly. “You need a ride?”<br/><br/>“No, I still have to get my clothes and change back.”<br/><br/>Matt chuckled, “Guess I’ll see you in the morning.”<br/><br/>“Thanks again.”<br/><br/>Watching Matt drive down the street, Brian looked for signs some concerned<br/>citizen had witnessed the scene. It seemed as nothing was amiss, so he turned<br/>and walked back through the still open front door.<br/><br/>Doing a thorough scan of the house, he made sure to leave no signs but the<br/>damage done to the house. He found three chunks of meat, now furless, and<br/>tossed them in a garbage bag. Since the only way back to his clothes that he<br/>knew went through the drainage ditch, he left that way.<br/><br/>As he picked his way through the palmetto bushes crowding the ditch, he kept<br/>his right hand on the butt of the Desert Eagle. Although he couldn’t smell, see<br/>or otherwise sense any enemies, he thought it wise to err on the side of<br/>caution.<br/><br/>He effortlessly jumped the chain link fence, back into the yard were he’d left<br/>his clothes. Tossing the clothes he was wearing in a pile, he stripped in the<br/>light of a half full moon. At least there is some time before the next full<br/>moon, he thought. He finished dressing, his mind going over all the<br/>difficulties the pack was in for because of this. Picking up the gun and<br/>clothes, he tossed the clothes into the garbage bag with chunks of meat. He<br/>tucked the pistol into the grey slacks.<br/><br/>Starting back towards the street, he pushed the thoughts from his mind. He kept<br/>a constant vigil for any sign of an ambush, scenting the air. His right thumb<br/>was hooked in his slack pocket, keeping the hand close to the pistol. He tossed<br/>the garbage bag into a can left by the street a few houses down, walking back<br/>to his house</p>

Territorial Aggression · By Jason BrewsterChapter one  Being a
werewolf could be a pain, especially when your fiancé was human. Smiling to
himself, Brian pressed the end button of his cell phone. He thought about
calling his fiancé, Alyssa, but decided to surprise her. It wasn’t too often
that his “weekly Sunday meetings” were cancelled.
His Alpha was out hunting tonight. There had been a couple mysterious
disappearances in the last week or two. Prior to these incidents, the last
thing the pack had dealt with was a lone vampire that intruded on their turf.
His pack controlled the area around Sarasota, Florida. Since the humans
couldn’t fend off the things that went bump in the night, the pack protected
the population of their territory.
his “normal” life he managed a warehouse off Clark Road. It supplied local
businesses with wholesale electronic components, golf cart parts, cooking
equipment, and a plethora of other things. Like all of the other packmates, he
worked for a company owned by Jonathon. He pulled his 69 Chevelle Malibu out of
the paking lot, looking forward to the coming evening
Jonathon was the Alpha of the pack. Like wolves, the pack was controlled by thestrongest member, and each pack had one Alpha. Brian had heard that otherlycanthropes had different family structures, but that was only hearsay so far.The only other lycanthrope he’d ever met was a werepanther, Josh.Josh had no pack, he ran solo. It didn’t seem to bother him, plus he had thewolves to back him up. Josh was an officer with the Sarasota police department.He was the reason the meeting had been called off. Not affiliated with a pack,he was a loner. He did share information with the pack and vice versa, which iswhat was happening tonight. He had something to discuss with Jonathon thatcouldn’t wait. Having a paranormal ally within the law enforcement system camein handy.Asides from Josh, Sarasota hosted half a dozen strong psychics and two witchfamilies. The only members of the families Brian had met were Margarete Armijo,who had dealings with the pack on occasion, and Roslyn McLeary, who was in thesame class as him in high school. They had dated briefly, but there had beentoo much drama. Mostly it was her family not approving of her dating awerewolf.Since Jonathon had called off the weekly meeting, Brian had decided to takeAlyssa out to dinner. A bartender at Chili’s during the night, she attended theRingling School of Art during the day. They barely had any time together, so itwas a rare treat when they got to go out. Sometimes it just seemed as thoughthey cohabitated in the same room. He’d fall asleep alone, and she’d wake upalone.Maybe this would help prevent them from drifting apart, he thoughtoptimistically. Of course, if they did drift apart it would solve the problemof keeping part of his life from the woman he loved, his mind countered.Pushing the thought from his mind, he tried to remain positive. He lovedAlyssa, just as he loved being a garou (werewolf). If he had to keep the twoseparate, it was a small price to pay.Brian was a pure bred, as were all of his packmates. The difference betweenother lycanthropes and a pure bred were simple. A pure bred was born that wayand changed during the late stages of puberty, while an infected lycan changedafter surviving an attack. Since lycanthropy, like vampirism, was kept out ofmainstream science, the exact method of transmission was unknown. Although itwas known that only an attack would spread the disease, it wasn’t transmittedsexually or by blood.Asides from having to keep such a large part of his life a secret, he wascontent. It was an extremely delicate balance, but he believed he had the actdown fairly well.Calling a Brazilian steak house, the Rodizio Grill, he reserved a table underhis full name, Brian Craft. Finished with that he turned up the stereo. Histhoughts elsewhere, his eyes barely registered the sun soaked scenery as itflew by,While garou had more longevity than humans, they were by no means immortal,like vampires. Being twenty-five Brian was just a pup. Thanks to lycan’s sloweraging, he barely looked twenty. Most people who met him and his fiancé thoughtshe was the older of the two, and she was only twenty-two.They had been dating for five years, living together the past three. After hisfather had died when he was eighteen, she had been the only one who could calmhis ensuing rage at the world. For two years he’d blown off her obviousconcern, trying to drown his pain in drugs, alcohol, and violence. Being agarou, drugs and alcohol didn’t work as well as it did for humans. Plus, whenyou can heal broken bones in the space of ten minutes, it was hard to haveenough pain inflicted upon him to mask the emotional distress he had felt.Two years of her unwavering attention while he watched her mature into abeautiful young woman had done its damage. Unwittingly, he had becomeenraptured with her, despite his attempts to ignore her. Once theirrelationship had started, it had matured slowly.The more he thought about it, the fact that it wasn’t a whirlwind of arelationship is probably what had helped hold it together. While most of theirfriends had loved and lost, their emotional bond had only grown stronger. He’dhave thought that spending too much time together would be their downfall, butnow the reverse worried him.Pulling the green muscle car off of Clark road, he made a right onto ColonialStreet. Passing the single story houses with their bright green, well keptyards, he pressed the garage door opener attached to the sun visor. The dooropened before he came to the stop sign where Colonial met Williamsburg Streetand ended. Driving the Chevelle through the slight jog to the left and up thedriveway, he parked next to Alyssa’s white 2008 Mustang GT.Pushing the garage door opener, he killed the large engine. He got out of thecar, walking past the white washer and dryer and up the three steps to the doorleading inside. Standing momentarily, he listened at the door. He could hearmusic playing and the sound, barely audible even to his extraordinary hearing,of pencil tip moving against paper.Opening the door, he walked into the entryway and removed his shoes. Theentryway was covered in white wallpaper with floral designs on it, a largemirror between the front and garage doors, the floor was polished hardwood. Itwrapped around to the right to meet the front door, a small white wooden dooredcloset to the left. The wall between the living room and entryway was onlyseven feet high and didn’t extend to the ceiling. An open four foot rectanglecut into the wall connected the two instead of a door.The living room was painted white, the carpet beige. Three of Alyssa’spaintings adorned the walls. There was also a forty-eight inch flat screen TVon a stand that held all the audio\visual electronics in it, a large beige pitgroup, and a wooden coffee table with four glass inserts in the top. Two thirdsof the length of the room back, the carpet ended and the off white tile of thedining room began.Centered to the breakfast bar, cut into the wall separating the kitchen anddining room, sat a brass and glass table with four black and brass chairs.Alyssa sat in the chair that faced the kitchen, with her back to the frontdoor, and prismacolored drawings spread over the table around her. Her longblonde hair was braided in pigtails and swung as she turned to look over hershoulder. She was dressed in an old GWAR shirt of Brian’s and a pair of rippedblue jeans, her feet bare.He could smell a faint tinge of fear on the air, mingling with her scent. Asshe saw him approach, a flitter of relief played across her face. “Hi babe, didyou forget something?” She asked.“No, something came up, so the meeting is cancelled.” He bent down and kissed herforehead. Standing erect, he looked into her vivid blue eyes. “So I madereservations at Rodizio’s for us.”“Have you done something I should know about?” She teased him, smiling goodnaturedly.The smile was infectious, and his face split into one. “No, little girl. I justthought we should take advantage of tonight.”“Sounds great. How long until we’re supposed to be there?”“Well, just in case you were doing something, I made the reservations for eightforty-five.”“Silly boy, you know I don’t have anything going on. It’s the beginning of myweekend.”“Hey, I never know. With my luck you’d have been out with friends till eight ifI’d made the reservations for seven thirty. Plus, I wanted to get a workout inwhile I have a chance.”Standing up, she gave him a hug. “Thanks, babe.”“For what?” he asked with an arched brow.“For being a loving, thoughtful boyfriend, and a little dense.” She winked athim surreptitiously.He gave her a quick kiss. “Thanks, I think.” Leaving her to her artwork, hewalked back through the living room and down the hallway to the right. Thehallway led to the weight room, guestroom and guest bathroom.Entering the second door on the right, he pulled off his polo shirt and khakisand put on the Miami Heat basketball shorts lying on the floor. Tossing theclothes in a pile by the door, he found the I-pod he kept in the room andinserted the ear pieces, putting the little machine on random. Lying down onthe cool vinyl bench, he brought the barbell up off the stand. As Ministry beganblaring in his ears he started to bench press the two hundred pounds he washolding.Thankfully the altered healing factor of lycanthropes made it really difficultto blow up like Conan-era Arnold. It allowed them to gain tremendous strengthwithout getting a huge physique. Although it took a conscious effort to have asoft touch, he thought as he pushed up another rep.After about fifteen reps he began to sweat a little, showing no other signs ofexertion. His breathing was timed to the reps, but he wasn’t huffing orpanting. Even his face appeared relaxed as his mind continued to run amok.The only things that a lycanthrope’s healing factor couldn’t deal with quicklywere wounds caused by other lycan’s claws or teeth while in wereform, silver,and vampiric bites or claw wounds. It caused one to have a lower regard forpersonal safety. Although, normal bullets and blades could still kill a lycanif the head could be severed completely off, the brain destroyed or the lycanbled to death.Of course, there was another side to all of it. You couldn’t just take a bulletto the chest in front of witnesses and walk away nonchalantly. There was acovenant that most lycans and vampires adhered to. Basically it said that allthe supernatural dirt had to be done out of the public eye. Also, they couldnever reveal themselves to humans, not even family.Brian almost laughed at the thought. Yeah, hey guys, sorry to inform you, butyour bloodline is tainted with a disease that only shows up once every couplethousand births. Oh, and I have it. Yeah, it makes me change into the wolfman.No seriously.The downside was that he would never be able to tell Alyssa about it. He’d haveto cringe in mock fear if some punk ever pulled a gun on them. When what he’dreally want to do is stomp a hole in him. Then again it was all conjecture.Point was, he would always be lying. He couldn’t stop being a garou, and hewouldn’t give up Alyssa. No matter how much nay saying they had done.He could still remember when the little fourteen year old punk girl hit thescene in Sarasota. Little did he realize, he’d later think of the event asdivine intervention. She had just moved with her parents from Kingman, Az. Forreasons he still couldn’t fathom, she had been drawn to him like a moth to flame.Not the typical teenager in anyway, he had fended off the young girlsinexplicable attraction to him, while his friends his age had dated girls asyoung as her or younger. As much as he’d blown her off, she had blown hisfriends off twice as much, he thought with a rueful smile. Guess that provesshe wasn’t like other girls her age. Most of them were so starved for affectionthat they weren’t without a boyfriend for more than a couple days at a time.Then his father had succumbed to cancer, and Brian got a glimpse of what hisfuture was to be like. Living longer than his human counterparts, he would beforced to watch everyone he knew or loved die. Lo and behold, the young Brianhad rebelled. It was funny, no amount of normal teenage angst could cause saidrebellion. Life had been too new and full of surprises. He’d only found out hewas a garou two and a half years before it happened.He’d quickly gained the reputation of being a quick tempered, heavy drinking,drug gobbling badass. He rarely lost a fight, even when he was jumped. As faras he was concerned the covenant could be damned. The only beatings he tookwere administered by his packmates.Jonathon had especially taken offense to his attitude. Of his two packenforcers, Matt had been the more sympathetic. His “lessons” had been gearedmore towards future conflict, while Jack’s (the other pack enforcer) andJonathon’s had been straight punishment, meant as an attitude adjustments.Yet none of that could dent the huge amount of rage he’d felt, nothing but onelittle seventeen year old girl. He could still remember that fateful eveningwith crystal clarity.It had been a weekend night towards the end of summer. Brian had been aimlesssince graduation two years prior. His employment by Jonathon was wearing thin.More often than not, he found himself getting a lesson from one or more of hispackmates instead of actually working at the warehouse. So, in typical weekendfashion, he found himself at the Blue Parrot bar catching a punk show andblowing off steam.The Parrot was a great venue that had closed down later. It’d had all agesshows and served alcohol. People usually had to go north to Tampa-St. Pete tofind that. The only drawback of the bar was its tiny layout. It was only twentyfeet across and eighty feet back, not including the backstage area. Coming fromthe front door, about forty feet of space was taken up by tables and the barthat ran along the wall to the right. Behind the bar, stairs ran up to thesecond floor that over looked the bar and was filled with couches and littletables.The stage only took up twelve feet and was elevated just a few inches above thefloor. The rest of the space was taken up by the pit area which had two supportbeams in it. The two foot across square concrete posts had been known to behazardous to people’s health, especially when the pit was rambunctious, as itwas on this evening. Brian manhandled his way through it, bouncing off peopleand slamming others at random.He had discovered that lsd was one of the only drugs his souped up metabolismcouldn’t pump out quickly, so he’d eaten a few hits on top of a lot ofJagermeister and a bit of nose candy. The aggressive tempo of the music wasbringing him closer and closer to a frenzy.Towards the end of the song, he began to batter the other people in the pit. Awell placed punch here, an elbow there, shoulder check that guy into a supportpost, and rebound with an elbow to some guys face. He flew around, concentratedmayhem on a destruction mission.Walking out of the pit to the bar when the song ended, he ordered a Bud Litedraft. Upending the glass, he slammed the beer before leaving the empty mug onthe bar and sauntering outside. In contrast to the stifling club filled withhot, sweaty bodies, the night air was crisp and refreshing, with a slightchill.Greedily, he sucked in large gulps of fresh air. There was a motley collectionof punks, skins, and scenesters hanging around the entrance and the benchlocated on the side walk by the road. He nodded to a group of his old friendsthat included Alyssa.Her hair was dyed orange with black tips that night. She had let it down foronce. Wearing white knee high stockings with short oxblood Doc Martin boots, aplaid skirt and a black Against All Authority tank top, she was quite afetching sight. She stared him in the eyes, unnerving him slightly.It wasn’t that she wasn’t attractive, or that he had a problem approachingwomen, he just didn’t see her in that light yet. All he was after was theconquests. Although he wouldn’t admit it, he cared for her too much to use anddiscard her. Plus, she was immature compared to the women he went after. Hisnew found confidence had given him access to older women, including thebartender that was serving him even though he was underage.Watching the faces of the young kids around him distort and melt, he didn’t payattention as four guys came out of the bar behind him. Their voices floating upfrom the doorway also didn’t register with his acid soaked mind.“Is that the asshole from the pit?”“Yeah, that’s him.”“Hey! You!” The yelling caused him to turn around, a fist caused him to spinback. Having been sucker punched brought him out of his stupor and straightinto attack mode. He was like a pitbull that had been fed black powder.Landing a solid hook to his attacker, he knocked out the first of the four.Before the guy could hit the sidewalk, Brian followed up with a straight rightinto the guy’s nose, adding insult to injury.Out of his peripheral vision, he saw one of his old friends, Cory, stalking theother three. His hand was about to go into the pocket of his leather jacket,where Brian knew he carried brass knuckles. The thought that someone was goingto try to save him made him smile.“Cory, don’t. I’ve got this,” he said, still smiling maniacally.His friend stared at him incredulously, shrugging. The mixture of the lunaticgrin, the confidence he exuded, and the fact he’d just called off the only helphe had caused the remaining three attackers to hesitate.Jumping on the opportunity, Brian slammed an elbow into the jaw of the attackerclosest to him. He went down in a heap, and Brian heard the sound of Mariocollecting a gold coin in the video game Super Mario Bros. Before the next guycould lift his arms, his face had already been stuffed with three quick,powerful punches. With every hit, the coin sound played in Brian’s head.The last guy standing had gathered the presence of mind to run. The smell ofhis fear excited Brian even more. Before the poor guy could run a dozen steps,he was spun around and headbutted viciously, twice.Brian lost it. He began screaming as he held up his slack body with one hand.The other hand punctuated each word with a brutal punch. “Try to jump me, huh?Who do you think you are? Four on one, huh?” He started slamming his fist intothe jelly that had been the guy’s face with every syllable. “Bad fuckingmistake, asshole.”Lost in the moment, he didn’t hear the diminutive voice behind him. “Brian,please.” But he did feel the hand on his shoulder when she placed it there tostop him.He dropped his victim and spun around, snatching Alyssa up by her neck with onehand. His right hand pistoned back to start battering his newest target. Hisface was twisted in a mask of hatred and rage.His mind recoiled at the fear, compassion, worry, and love etched on the faceof the beautiful girl he was about to pound into a bloody mess of broken boneand flesh. Everything stopped, and the walls of hate and rage he had builtaround the grief for his father came crashing down.Letting go of her, a single tear ran from his eye. His acid soaked brain beganto make connections. He had never truly grieved for his father, just covered itup. He actually loved the little girl in front of him, and she really, trulyloved him.Turning off his memories, he set the bar back on its stand with a mighty heave.Although the memories were a great motivator when working out, that part alwaysdrained him. He laid there, his sweat turning cool, as he felt the torn musclesrepairing themselves.After a couple of minutes, he got up and started doing military benches,reminiscing again. He thought of how happy the pack had been when he finallycame around. Until they found out the reason, that was.Smiling, he wondered why, when everything they had said to him to calm him hadbounced right off, they suddenly thought their advice would stick. None of themunderstood why he choose would the hassle of a permanent human mate. Jonathonwas convinced he would betray the covenant at first. Matt continually extolledthe virtues of a garou mate. Which he would, being mated to Sarah, who wasanother packmate. At the time she was the only other female in the pack.Over the years they had grown to know and accept her. Jonathon was the soleholdout, but it didn’t seem to matter that the owner of a business was aloofaround his manager’s fiancé. Matt and Sarah had become their best friends, asfar as couples were concerned. There were still the occasional propheticdoomsday comments, but Brian thought they had decided to let him live his ownlife.Lifting the small forty pound dumbbell over his head for the umpteenth time, heruminated that it was probably a lot easier not trying to tell him how to livenow that he’d quit being such a jerk. Plus there weren’t many possiblerepercussions for the pack. He was only messing up his own life.Her family had actually put up more of a fight than his pack had. To them,Brian had no future, or at least not one good enough for Alyssa. It hadn’thelped that his reputation preceded him to the point where both her youngersisters and older brother knew of him, none of it good. He’d even had toswallow his pride and not retaliate when her brother had sucker punched him.In his opinion, they still didn’t believe he was good enough for her, but atleast they had quit trying to pull them apart. It probably had a lot to do withher blowing them off after the incident with her brother. Brian still feltpride at the amount of self restraint he had shown that day. He knew Alyssa wasvery proud that he had kept his cool. His relationship with her brother, Josh,was barely amicable to this day.Where once he had felt nothing could come between them, now budding seeds ofdoubt began to bloom. While his rational mind knew it was only the amount oftime spent apart, he couldn’t quell the feeling of unease he’d begun to have.As soon as he had let any doubt in, it had begun to eat at him.Well hopefully tonight will help put some of that to rest, he thought. It wasdefinitely good luck that had brought him this opportunity. He knew he shouldjust blow off the irrational thoughts, but it was more easily said than done.He blew out a heavy sigh, pumping out three more reps before changing exercisesagain.As he started doing single curls, alternating hands, he tried to clear hismind. Dwelling on the subject just gave it more sustenance, which was the lastthing he needed to do. Instead, he focused on the music pouring into his ears.Timing his reps to coincide with the rhythm, he zoned out.Finishing up, he replaced all the weights and the I-pod to their prearrangedspots. Leaving the room, he switched off the lights. He strode into the livingroom on his way to the master bedroom. Alyssa was hunched over one of herdrawings, lost to the world, her colored pencil a blur. Other drawings stilllay on the glass dining room table, an arch of art around her.The picture she was working on reminded Brian of a bad acid trip. It was one ofher few darker pieces, an expedition into her subconscious. It was kind ofpost-apocalyptic; a burnt, melted cityscape with half decomposed bodies lyingin the street that made up the foreground.Even with that subject, the picture had beauty. The sky was a pink and purplesunset. The colors reflected off the towering lumps of melted glass that hadonce been skyscrapers. Plus, he noted, the detail was amazing.The door to the master bedroom was off the dining room. Moving stealthily, heretreated through it and closed the door softly. He didn’t want to ruin herconcentration. Stripping off the shorts he went straight for the masterbathroom. Padding over cool tile, he moved quietly to the shower and turned iton. Stepping into the small room of a shower, he let the water sluice the sweatand dirt from his body. He luxuriated in the hot spray.Chapter twoThe dinner had gone well, and Brian was looking forward to taking his fiancéhome. He could tell from her scent and body language that she was anticipatingwhat would follow when they got there.Walking out of the Rodizio Grill, Brian caught the faint scent of an unfamiliargarou in werewolf form. He didn’t even recognize the garou’s bloodline, butcould tell it wasn’t an Alpha or a pure bred. Inhaling deeply through his nose,he could tell the garou was actually a fair distance away. He realized that ifthe balmy wind hadn’t been from the southwest, he would never have caught thescent.“You alright, babe?” Alyssa asked looking at him with a puzzled expression onher beautiful face, her head cocked slightly to one side. Brian looked downthen swept his gaze up from her black stiletto heels, over the creamy expanseof leg, over the small black cocktail dress that clung to her body. He tried toimprint the picture to his memory, knowing he couldn’t stay with her now.“Sorry, baby. I’ve got a lot of shit on my mind. I think it’d be better if Iwalk back to the house. Just to clear my head.” Although lying to her wasalmost painful, he could see no way around it. This part of his life wouldalways be a secret.“What’s wrong?” She stepped closer to him, the scent of her perfume mingledwith the unique musk that was all her own and filled his nostrils.“It’s just from shit from work. I’m sorry, baby, but I won’t be worth a damntill I figure this out. I’m still coming home, I promise. I just need this.” Hedidn’t know what else to say, and he was afraid if he waited much longer, he’dlose the scent.Leveling her head and frowning slightly, she answered, “If you say so. Try notto be too long, ok?”Nodding, Brian watched her walk to her Mustang, his eyes fixated on her assthrough the thin material of her dress. For a split second he forgot about theother garou, but he caught the faint scent once again on the humid night air.He cursed the sacrifices he was sometimes forced to make, turning and walkingaway as Alyssa got into her car.Once out of her sight, he moved quickly. Leaving the Gulf Gate businessdistrict, he started passing one story suburban homes. Reaching into the grayslacks he realized he had left his cell phone at home. While it was a fortunatemistake if Alyssa tried to call him, it meant he couldn’t inform his packmates.He was going in solo. Nearing the garou’s location, he began searching for adeserted house or yard. His hazel eyes lit upon a for sale sign a couple housesdown.Walking down the street, he watched the houses and yards for any sign of beingwatched. He saw no one, and the little white house appeared vacant. Walkingtowards up the concrete drive, he sniffed the air. He was still downwind of thegarou and there were no canines in the vicinity.Some dogs acted weird around garou in human form, although most werefrightened. When a dog was around a garou changing shape, they went nuts. Itwas the kind of attention he had to avoid.He hurdled the three foot chain link fence without breaking stride, dartinginto the shadows. Once in the shelter of the dark backyard, he strippedquickly. Folding the grey slacks, black button up shirt and boxers, he put themon top of his shoes on the small wooden deck.Taking a deep breath, he forced himself to change. His back arched as painripped through him. His five foot eleven inch frame began to grow, light brownfur rippling over his body. There was an audible crack as his facial bonesshifted to allow a snout to flow forward. Two more followed as his knees poppedbackwards. Moonlight glinted off of his teeth as they grew past his lips, atwisted grimace on his flowing face. Thirty seconds after the change hadstarted, it was over. He breathed a sigh of relief as the pain receded.He bounded over the fence and into drainage ditch, running towards where thescent originated from. He let himself go, tearing through palmetto bushes,reveling in the physical sensations of his muscles uncoiling and the wind inhis fur.Seemingly no sooner than he had started to run, he was behind the house thegarou was in, looking through the back sliding glass door. Seeing no movementinside the living room, he used his advanced senses to try and ascertain whatwas going on. His pulse quickened as he scented fear and blood. A low moan ofanguish was barely audible.He launched himself though the glass door, avoiding the white leather furnitureand little wooden coffee table. Landing on the thick white shag carpeting, herolled to his feet and ran into the short hallway to the right. The second dooron the left was slightly ajar, the assaulting stench of fear, anguish, andhuman blood wafting from it.Bounding towards the door, he stopped two feet from it and pushed it opengently, beware of a trap. Rage boiled inside of him at the sight that greetedhis eyes.It was apparent that the huge black garou hadn’t heard the glass breaking; hewas so intent on ravaging his victim. Splatters of blood randomly sprayed thewhite walls and ceiling crimson. The large beast had its claws and teeth sunkinto the body on the brass frame bed. Sheets black with blood dripped onto thecarpet staining it red.Brian launched himself at the beast’s bared back, taking advantage of hisopponent’s inattention. He clamped his teeth into its right shoulder, sinkinghis claws into the left shoulder and right bicep. The huge size of the garouwas even more apparent once he was latched on. Brian’s rear claws were two feetoff the ground, tearing at the back of his adversary’s legs as he scrambled tofind some grip. He flexed his jaw muscles, trying to shatter the huge beast’scollarbone or separate it’s rotator cuff.His opponent reacted, seizing him by the neck and flinging him across the room.The action caused Brian to rip chunks from the garou’s shoulders. Brian flewinto the stained cedar dresser opposite the door to the hall. The force of theimpact drove the dresser into the drywall breaking it and cracking the studsbehind it.Jumping up, Brain faced the huge black beast. Blood ran from both shouldersmatting the fur. The right shoulder and arm were worse wounds than the leftshoulder, but none of the wounds seemed like enough to even slow his opponentdown. Brian spit the mouthful of flesh and fur on the carpet. Doing so was aninsult by garou customs. Basically, he just said he had no respect and nothingto fear from him. As his adversary came around the bed between them, Brianimproved his stance, settling his weight on the balls of his feet.In a blur of superhuman speed the massive black beast rushed him, swingingwildly. Brian ducked under a right and sidestepped. He raked his claws acrossits abdomen, opening four wounds. The garou whirled, cracking him in the sideof the head with a spinning back fist.His adversary tried to press the advantage, throwing a powerful right haymaker.Ducking underneath, he stepped closer to the garou, smothering its power. Heslammed a left elbow into its solar plexus, following up with a right elbow tothe snout. Brian was grabbed and tossed into the wall to the right. The garoushook his head to clear it before lunging at Brian again.He hit the wall, bounced to the floor, rolled and came up crouched, whitedrywall dust in his fur. Using his legs to explode forward, he met the garou inthe air. Its momentum was too much to overcome, and they ended up on the floor.Brian was on his back below the beast, barely holding its snapping maw from hisface and neck.Wrapping its hands around Brian’s neck, the garou started squeezing, chokinghim. He moved his hold off the beast so that he was gripping the upper andlower jaws and began to wrench them apart. His adversary grunted and releasedthe strangle hold, allowing Brian to twist around to his hands and knees. Thegarou blasted the back of his head with a flurry of punches, only stopping towrap him in a bear hug as Brian stood up.Pretending to struggle, he jockeyed his left foot behind the beast. Bending hisright knee, he swept his opponents foot forward as he snapped his right legstraight, pushing the garou over on his back and landing on top of it. Theimpact sent the air rushing from the beast’s lungs, causing it to loosen thebear hug. Brian used the slight break to twist around and lunge up, freeing hisarms. Using short quick swipes, he started raking his claws down its face.The beast released the hold of Brian’s abdomen to grab his wrists. Brianlowered his snout and snapped a little chunk of flesh from its chest. Onceagain he spit the mouthful out, this time in its face. Wrestling with the garouhe finally pinned its left arm under his right knee.He began to rain punishment down on his opponent, alternating punches, elbowstrikes, facial slashes, and when no other opening presented itself, he slashedits right shoulder and arm. The massive garou bucked until it freed its arm,spinning to its hands and knees.Brian was ready for this and ran his claws down its back before putting somedistance between them. He watched the beast warily as it whirled around to facehim once again. Blood ran from more than a dozen wounds.He knew the only reason he wasn’t dead yet was because his adversary wasrelying on brute force instead of skill and experience. He also noted that thegarou fought as a human would, not like a werewolf should. He thanked his luckystars the beast wasn’t properly trained.Deciding to play with it a little, he assumed a boxer’s stance and asked, “HeyFido, does your Alpha know you’re attacking humans.” His voice was distortedfrom speaking through a snout, and it was lower due to changed vocal chords.The huge garou gave a throaty laugh. “Stupid pup, this is a recruitment.” Itswung a wild right haymaker.Ducking under the blow, he slammed a right to the body followed by a left hookto its face. The garou stumbled back two steps and threw a left hook. Circlingto his right, Brian caught the punch and blasted a hard jab into its snout.The beast howled in rage, grabbing Brian and tossing him into the wall abovethe dresser once again. Drywall and studs broke as he went into and through thewall, landing on the beige tile of the master bathroom.Rising to his feet, he looked back at the master bedroom through the hole inthe wall. The garou tossed the dresser to the side and kicked the lower part ofthe wall in. Gripping the hole in the wall on either side, it ripped the walldown, enlarging the hole.Brian ripped the porcelain sink from the wall as the beast broke a stud, makingroom for it to fit through. Water gushed from the broken pipes, drenching himas the garou entered the bathroom. Gripping the sink in his left hand hefeinted a strike with it. His adversary went to block and Brian ripped hisright claw across its stomach. He ducked a wild right and smashed the sinkacross its head opening a large gash along the side of it. The chunk of thesink in his right hand protruded about five inches from his closed fist,tapering into a curved point. Brian then had to eat a left hook in order toland an overhand right of his own.Ducking another wild right, he slammed the makeshift porcelain shank into thegarou’s exposed stomach. As Brian sank it into the beast’s stomach again itgrabbed him by his right shoulder with its left hand and slammed a viciousright into his face. He saw a bright flash of white light before the powerfulblow knocked him into a punch drunk daze. His adversary laughed with a deeprumbling sound.Even a little out of it, he knew that he wouldn’t survive if he took many moreof these powerful blows. If he were to be knocked unconscious, the beast couldkill him at its leisure. Watching its right fist as the garou drew back for thenext blow, desperation took hold in Brian. Before the fist could streak towardshim again he jammed the makeshift shank into the underside of the beast’s jaw.It yelped in surprise and Brian opened his hand, slamming his palm into theporcelain to drive it deeper.The garou released its grip and howled in anguish, reaching for it’s woundedsnout with both hands. Brian blasted a right hook into its face then slashed itwith his left claw. Keeping the momentum going he popped two quick jabs intoits wounded snout before catching the chunk of porcelain with a right uppercut.Brian pressed his advantage, slowly walking the garou back, out of thebathroom, hitting it with quick straight strikes. Once he had it backedsufficiently into the master bedroom, he began to circle to his right.Switching from knuckles to claws, he continued his vicious attack. The largegarou bellowed, pulling the chunk of porcelain from its snot. His chest, stomach,and arms were a mess of bleeding slashes.Brian ducked its attempt to imbed the chunk into his face, stepping in andsinking his right claws into its stomach almost to the first knuckle. He didthe same with to the garou’s right calf. Sinking his teeth into its hamstrings,he attempted to hobble the giant.Once again Brian found himself hurtling through the hole in the wall. This timethe impact cracked drywall, cinderblock, and shattered the mirror above wherethe sink had been. He landed in a puddle, water cascading onto him.He pushed himself to his feet, spitting the newest chunk of flesh onto the wettiles. Peering through ten hole, he expected the huge garou to follow him intothe bathroom, Instead the bedroom was abandoned, the door to the hall stillswinging.Brian shook himself, spraying the bathroom with the water in his fur beforebounding after his opponent. He stayed low, running on all fours to avoid anypossible ambushes. Not spotting his prey in the hall, he ran into the livingroom. As he rounded the corner, he found the coffee table sailing through theair at him.He took the impact on his forearms, deflecting the table to the left, rising,his arms raised to block the next attack. Once his line of sight was clear offlying furniture, he saw the large garou disappear into the drainage ditch.He started towards the broken sliding glass door to follow before thinkingbetter of it. He padded back into the bedroom, creeping up to the bed. Thebloody mess on the bed was still breathing. Walking back into the living room,he searched until he found a Thrasher magazine with the address on it. Findinga phone in the kitchen, he dialed a number from memory. It took two attempts ofhitting the buttons with his claws.“Hello?’ A female answered.“Hey Sarah, can I yell at Matt? It’s Brian.”“Umm, yeah, just a sec,” she said, puzzlement evident in her voice.After a couple moments Matt came on the line. “Hey bro, what’s up?”“Sorry to bother you, but I have a problem. I need you to come to…” Brianlooked at the address and recited it.“OK, what’s goin on?”“I’ve got an attack survivor. I fought off the garou, and I need you to lookafter this kid.”“Fuck. Did you tell Jonathon?”“Nope. I was hoping you could fill him in. I’m on this guy’s landline, and Jonathonwould kill me if I called his phone,” Brian explained.“Yeah, you’ve gotta point. I’ll be there as soon as possible.”“Thanks.” The line was already dead.He crept warily back into the bedroom, surveying the extent of the damage tothe person in the bloody bed. The victim was severely ravaged most of themuscle and flesh of the right leg was gone. Both of his forearms, chest, face,and left bicep were also torn asunder. Checking the victim’s vitals, Brianrealized two things in quick succession. First, the victim was male. The secondrealization was that the guy had fallen into a lycanthropic healing coma, andthe wounds were already beginning to close.Brian didn’t know much about infected victims, but it didn’t seem normal forsomeone so recently infected to be able to enter a healing sleep already. Heshook his head. Keeping his senses alert for the return of his opponent, hebegan to clean up.He wrapped the young male’s worst wounds with what little bedding wasn’talready soaked in blood. Once the guy was situated as well as could be, hewaded through the destruction of the bathroom. Finding the water shut offvalve, he stopped the water cascading onto the tiles. Searching the small roomfor garbage bags, he came up empty.Checking on the victim, he found the kid’s pulse stronger, his breathing lessshallow and irregular. Satisfied the kid would be alright, he proceedingthrough the house to the kitchen. He stopped in the living room, taking in adeep breath of warm night air coming in through the broken sliding glass door.There was no trace of any garou scents.Rifling through drawers and cabinets, he came upon some hefty bags. He carriedhis find back into the bedroom, remaining in were form incase the garou fromearlier came back. Since he had no weapons, it seemed like the best idea.Gathering the bloody remains of the bedding, he bagged it. Using his claws, hecut the blood soaked carpet. Shouldering the bed out of his way, he collectedthe carpet scraps and bagged them also. Finished with that, he looked about forthe porcelain shank from earlier. After an exhaustive search of the bed andbath rooms came up with nothing, he broadened his search to the other rooms. Hefinally located the chunk in the living room, lying on the carpet by the couch.He was about to go back into the bed room when he caught the sound of an enginecoming down the quiet suburban street. The noise grew closer, headlightslighting the room as the vehicle swung into the drive.Brian bounded to the window, using one claw to raise a blind. He was rewardedwith the sight of Matt’s battered grey Silverado running in the drive. Thewiry, brown skinned male in his apparent mid twenties was Brian’s packmate.Matt ran his hand over his short cropped black hair, sniffing the air. He wasdressed as usual in climbing boots, jeans, and a black t-shirtBrian realized he’d been holding his breath and released it. He unlocked thefront door then moved back out of view as Matt walked up. In the pack hierarchyhe was immediately above Brian, and was his closest confidant.“Come in.” Brian said in a normal volume. Matt walked in, quickly shutting thedoor. Brian continued, “Sorry to interrupt your evening.’Matt cracked his trademark, devil may cry smile. “Don’t worry about it, got meout of the house.”“Please tell me you brought some firepower?”“Of course,” Matt replied, pulling a Desert Eagle .357 from the waist band ofhis jeans.Brian’s were form rippled as the fur retracted into the body as it shrank backto human. His naked body was completely clean. Even the scent of the otherGarou was gone. Taking the pistol from Matt, he hefted the reassuring weight,smiling. His left hand still held the chunk of porcelain.Matt’s smile never faltered. “So what the fuck happened?’Shaking his head, Brian began his summary. While he related the story, he ledMatt back into the bedroom. Matt’s brown eyes quickly took in the scene,darting over the damage to the room, the two black trash bags, and settling onthe victim’s still form. As the two moved closer to the bed, Matt’s smilefaded.“The damage was worse. He’s fallen into a regenerative coma,” Brian observed.“Fuck,” Matt said with a shrug of his shoulders, “it’s better than a body.Still, Jonathon is going to be pissed.”Brian pulled his gaze from the young male’s slowly healing wounds, looking upinto Matt’s face. “Did you talk to him?”Matt’s smile returned. “Left that for Sarah. You want to talk about pissed.”“Shit, so you don’t know what the plan is?”\“I talked to her on the way over. I’m taking our friend here to Carlos’s house.We’re all meeting up at the warehouse early in the morning. I guess Josh hadsome bad news.”“Yeah, I bet it has something to do with this. And what the fuck is early?”“Around six. What time do you start opening?”“Seven, so that should be fine. How do you want to do this?” Brian motioned tothe inert body they were standing next to.“Fuck, I wish Jonathon was here.” Matt paused before starting back up. “Wraphim in a blanket, toss him in the cab. I guess.”“You mind doing that while I find some clothes and pack him a bag?”“No problem.” Matt started searching for a comforter, Brian having alreadybagged the bloody one.
He walked through the debris back into thebedroom, wiping his feet on the carpet to clean them off. Matt was rolling thebody in a green comforter, while Brian scoured the closet. Finding an old gymbag, he filled it with clothes.Selecting a pair of ripped jeans that would fit his waist and an old flannelshirt, he put them on. He stuffed the .357 into the waistband and rolled up theexcess of the long jeans. He then slipped on a pair of Nike’s that were toolarge for him, tossing a newer pair in the bag.Shouldering the gym bag, he snatched up the two garbage bags and strode out ofthe house. Matt cradled the blanket swathed young man and followed. Briantossed the bags into the truck, while Matt stuck the motionless body into thecab.Matt closed the passenger door softly. “You need a ride?”“No, I still have to get my clothes and change back.”Matt chuckled, “Guess I’ll see you in the morning.”“Thanks again.”Watching Matt drive down the street, Brian looked for signs some concernedcitizen had witnessed the scene. It seemed as nothing was amiss, so he turnedand walked back through the still open front door.Doing a thorough scan of the house, he made sure to leave no signs but thedamage done to the house. He found three chunks of meat, now furless, andtossed them in a garbage bag. Since the only way back to his clothes that heknew went through the drainage ditch, he left that way.As he picked his way through the palmetto bushes crowding the ditch, he kepthis right hand on the butt of the Desert Eagle. Although he couldn’t smell, seeor otherwise sense any enemies, he thought it wise to err on the side ofcaution.He effortlessly jumped the chain link fence, back into the yard were he’d lefthis clothes. Tossing the clothes he was wearing in a pile, he stripped in thelight of a half full moon. At least there is some time before the next fullmoon, he thought. He finished dressing, his mind going over all thedifficulties the pack was in for because of this. Picking up the gun andclothes, he tossed the clothes into the garbage bag with chunks of meat. Hetucked the pistol into the grey slacks.Starting back towards the street, he pushed the thoughts from his mind. He kepta constant vigil for any sign of an ambush, scenting the air. His right thumbwas hooked in his slack pocket, keeping the hand close to the pistol. He tossedthe garbage bag into a can left by the street a few houses down, walking backto his house",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The bullies at school laugh at the warning. They beat up Okumu and steal his drum. But when the biggest bully pounds on the drum, instead of beautiful music, his ears grow so large that it becomes bigger than an elephant's. Another bully's feet grow so large that he trips over them. Another bully's lips grow so long that it reaches the ground. All the other kids and even the teachers are terrified and run. </p>
<p>The villagers are angry and they surround grandma Min Akello's house. They say if Okumu doesn't surrender the drum so they can destroy it, they would chase him and his grandma away and burn their home. When Okumu hears this he runs into the dreaded Bungatira forest. He hopes to find the mysterious old man so he can return the drum.  <img alt=""Okumu flees with the drum into the forest"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/515544/pictures/original/20121031004202-ForestForest.jpg?1351669377"" src="""" style="""" title=""Okumu in Bungatira Forest""/></p>
<p>Okumu has to survive giant snakes, wild animals and Obibi the 10-eyed monster before he finally makes it through the forest. He's tired and falls asleep on the banks of the great river Nile whose water level had fallen because of a drought.  </p>
<p>Okumu wakes up sad and lonely. He cries because he wants to be home. He starts pounding on the drum hoping the music would cheer him up. Lo and behold! the water level begins to rise on the river Nile. Suddenly the fish begin to jump high into the sky, dancing to the music and twisting in mid-air before plunging back into the water. But some of the fish jump so high into the air, instead of dropping back into the river, they fall by the river bank right next to Okumu. Soon there is a mountain of fish by the river's bank.  </p>
<p><img alt=""Okumu is delighted when the fish start dancing"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/515551/pictures/original/20121031004646-BestIndieGoOkumuFish.jpg?1351669665"" src="""" style="""" title=""Okumu by the banks of the River Nile""/></p>
<p>Okumu was so delighted and having such a wonderful time he didn't notice two hungry fishermen from Palabek village sneaking up behind him.  </p>
<p>The fishermen had not caught any fish for months. They could not believe their eyes when they saw all the colorful fish dropping by the river bank just waiting to be picked because of the drum's magical powers. </p>
<p>The fishermen grabbed Okumu and tied him up. He struggled and cried in vain. The fishermen packed the fish in their huge bags and ran off with the boy's drum. They left Okumu there hoping he would be devoured by wild animals. The fishermen knew they would be welcomed like heroes when they returned home with food.   </p>

<p>Ayom the monkey heard Okumu's cries and emerged from the forest. Okumu begged Ayom to untie him but Ayom didn't understand the boy's strange language and wondered why the boy couldn't speak his own language. Okumu feared that if Ayom left he would be at the mercy of wild animals.  </p>

<p>Later, when a search party from Bungatira village saw that the people of Palabek had Okumu's drum in their possession, and when they couldn't find the boy, they concluded that he had been killed. So they started preparing for war with the people of Palabek.   </p>
<p>So what happens next? Will Ayom help free Okumu before he's eaten by wild animals? Will he find the fishermen who stole his drum? Will he ever see his home and his grandmother again? Will the people of Bungatira and the people of Palabek go to war? </p>
<p>These are some of the many questions that are answered in the rest of the story ""Okumu And His Magical Drum.""  </p>
<p>Okumu is a book for all age groups. My four year old niece Alysa loves it.</p>
<p><img alt=""Niece Alyssa loves Okumu"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/515485/pictures/original/20121030234556-Alyssa2.jpg?1351665961"" src="""" style="""" title=""Alyssa is an Okumu fan""/></p>
<p>My grownup friends, in their 20s, 50s, and even 70s also love it. I also sent the story to a very famous grownup and this is what he said -- words that will appear on the back jacket: </p>
<p><strong><em>""Okumu converts awful bullies into admirers after he survives the 10-eyed monster and captivity! His friend Ayom the monkey mocks humans who can't understand his language. The fish are dancing. Okumu helps prevent a war. This is a beautiful story that should never end.""</em></strong></p>
<p>Guess who this famous person was? None other than Dr. Bill Cosby -- yes, the one of <strong>The Cosby Show</strong> fame and many other productions. He's a generous philanthropist, educator, entertainer and author of several books.  </p>
<p>I agree that the story should never end. That's why I'm already working on a second story where Okumu rescues a girl named Anena who's also bullied at another school. The two then team up with Ayom and they embark on a journey to rescue other victims of bullying.  </p>
<p>I've posted the first two chapters from the ""Okumu.."" manuscript so you can get a taste of this story. Journalism is my regular day job; covering crime, corruption, disasters and even murder. So writing ""Okumu.."" was great fun. I wrote the first draft on a notebook with a pen -- sometimes on the subway and sometimes while waiting for my steamed fish order at this joint in Harlem. </p>
<p>Now, with your support I can have ""Okumu And His Magical Drum"" ready for shipping by the first week of December so everyone can enjoy it or send it out as a Christmas, a Kwanzaa, or as a New Year's gift to friends, family and loved ones. </p>

<p>I grew up in Uganda, in Tanzania and here in the U.S. My late father, Otema Allimadi, was ambassador to Washington, D.C.  </p>

<p>When my family returned to Uganda, we lived in Bungatira village, where I remember hearing beautiful folk tales called ""ododo"" from grandmothers while sitting outdoors around a fire at night. In most of these stories ""Apwoyo"" the rabbit always outwits bigger animals who want to harm him. When I was 10, I started telling my own stories to my younger siblings. At that time only Andrew, Walter and Sue were old enough to understand. My siblings enjoyed my stories so much that they even gave me their daily allotment of cookies! One day I was tired so I had a truck run over the main character Oyo. My sister Sue burst into tears. I quickly resurrected Oyo.  </p>
<p>One day, my family had to leave Uganda in a hurry. General Idi Amin was doing nasty things to folks and tried to kill our dad. My family lived in Tanzania for almost 10 years. My family went back to Uganda years later after Amin himself left in a hurry; I came back to the United States.  </p>
<p>My father didn't think telling stories, or making movies, my other dream, were serious professions. I studied economics at Syracuse University. Later, I studied journalism at the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University.  </p>
<p>Many years ago, I bumped into Bill Cosby while jogging. About 10 years later, I wrote him a letter with my idea to start a weekly newspaper. He sent me a check for the seed money.  </p>
<p>That's how I launched <em>The Black Star News</em> with two friends Ben Otunu and Mana Kasongo, who's now a doctor.</p>
<p>I Spend much of my time during the day HELPING OTHER people by reporting on and covering stories about injustices people face every day. Stories that are ignored by the major media -- even when the cases are compelling. </p>
<p>I've always cheered for underdogs. Here are a few stories I've covered in <em>The Black Star News</em>: </p>
<p>I wrote about an elderly Jewish Holocaust survivor who was in her 70s and now 80s, <a href=""http://www.blackstarnews.com/news/135/ARTICLE/5798/2009-06-23.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mrs. Gizella Weisshaus</a>, who filed a lawsuit against Swiss banks for looted assets of Nazi Holocaust survivors. Other victims joined her in a class action and the banks settled for over $1 billion. It turns out that her own lawyer who initially helped her with that case was shady and also stole money from her. He even stole $500,000 he had won from the Swiss banks on behalf of another elderly Holocaust survivor; didn't give her a penny, and later ""donated"" $7,000 of her own money for her funeral. Partly due to my stories that lawyer has since been disbarred. The same lawyer had wanted to represent African American clients who were preparing to sue for Reparations.</p>
<p>I also wrote about a Taiwanese immigrant named <a href=""http://www.blackstarnews.com/news/124/ARTICLE/7472/2011-06-20.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sunny Shue</a>, who was fighting against some banks that wanted to wrongfully foreclose on his house -- and the bank was aided by several biased rulings by a New York State Supreme Court judge. Sunny on several occasions told me he feared for his life. I published several articles about his case. Sunny made a video, which is now posted on YouTube expressing fear for his life. It turns out that Sunny was right. He eventually died under very mysterious circumstances which are yet to be investigated by the New York Police Department -- I am still working on that case together with a friend of Sunny's named Wil Galison who is now also a freelance writer for <em>The Black Star News</em>.  </p>
<p>Another story I recently wrote is about a man named <a href=""http://www.blackstarnews.com/news/128/ARTICLE/8339/2012-07-13.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Benjamin Cunningham</a> who was dragged one morning out of his house here in New York by Federal marshals without a warrant on suspicion that he was allegedly harboring his brother who lived in North Carolina and was a suspect in a drug related case. It turns out that the Marshals were wrong and Cunningham had not even been in touch with that brother who was later arrested in another state. </p>
<p>Cunningham was beaten during the search and even struck by a bus as he tried to flee the assault. Later, a Magistrate Judge recommended that Cunningham's case should go to trial and be decided by a jury. But a trial judge ignored the magistrate judge's recommendation and ruled in favor of the Marshals (U.S. government) who argued that they had qualified immunity and dismissed the case.  </p>
<p>While these kind of stories sometimes help people as in the case of Mrs. Weisshaus -- who herself is a formidable fighter and is still fighting other cases of injustice against her-- they are also very draining. (My next book will focus on <em>The Black Star News</em> and the kind of cases I cover).</p>
<p>In addition to my own reporting, every Monday, I teach a free journalism workshop in Brooklyn to ordinary people in the community so that they too can learn to report and write about news in their neighborhoods.  </p>
<p>So writing children's stories is also a nice way for me to relax and eventually share a wonderful story with young readers and adults. Since <em>The Black Star News</em> is a small independent newspaper the company can't devote resources to publish a children's book such as ""Okumu And His Magical Drum.""  Also, even though a book agent loves the manuscript that process takes a long time and there's no guarantee of publication.  </p>
<p>And while philanthropist Cosby was helpful with seed money to launch <em>The Black Star</em>, he supports thousands of other projects and one can't go back to drink from the same well every day.  </p>
<p>So that's where you can come into the picture and help bring Okumu to life by supporting this campaign for independent publishing of Okumu. </p>
<p>Sometimes as adults we become <strong>BORING</strong> and forget about some of the things we used to love and enjoy. A few months ago when I was stuck on the subway train here in New York City I pulled out a notebook and started writing Okumu.</p>
<p>I tried writing the story many years ago but never went more than a few pages. This time, I found that I couldn't stop writing.</p>
<p>Within a very short time I had finished ""Okumu And His Magical Drum."" Most of my friends who've read sample chapters love Okumu. I really hope you too love the boy and his friend Ayom the monkey. I'm almost finished with a second book.  </p>
<p>So, if you'd like to share in Okumu's adventures, please support this Indiegogo campaign. Send a link to someone you know. Who knows, if we get enough support, one day we could make an animated movie version of Okumu and Ayom. Maybe I could end up making films after all....  </p>
<p><strong>HOW MUCH IS THE BOOK?:</strong> The book (Hard Cover) will be priced @ $25. Please look at the rewards section to see how much to add for U.S. or international postage.</p>
<p>I will try to start sending out orders by the third week of December, 2012 so people can get the book during this holiday season. While I can't guarantee you'd get the book before the end of the holidays because of the volume of mail that's sent out in December, I believe Okumu will still be a timeless gift even if you get it in January, 2013.  </p>
<p><strong>WOULD YOU LIKE TO HIRE THE ARTISTS?:</strong> If you like the Artist Brigette Burns's work take a look at <a href=""http://brigettemarieburns.weebly.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://brigettemarieburns.weebly.com</a> for more of her work. If you'd like to hire her too contact her at contactbrigette@hotmail.com </p>
<p><strong>WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO DO A READING AND BOOK SIGNING?:</strong> Yes, I would be happy to after the book comes out in December, 2012. You can send me an email now at mallimadi@gmail.com to discuss and make plans.  </p>
<p>I've already finished the first draft of a follow up story so if enough people like Okumu maybe we will have a series.</p>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>HERE ARE TWO SAMPLE CHAPTERS</div>
 <br/><strong>OKUMU AND HIS MAGICAL DRUM</strong> <br/> <br/><strong>Chapter One: The Ugly Boy</strong> <br/> <br/> <br/>Okumu's parents and five siblings perished during the Great Famine in Palabek and that's how the poor boy ended up with his Grandmother, Min Akello in Rwot Obilo village.  Min Akello's husband, Tung Dyang, had passed away long ago. <br/> <img alt=""Okumu and Min Akello's homestead in Rwot Obilo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/516515/pictures/original/20121031135136-Bungatira.jpg?1351716702"" src="""" style="""" title=""Rwot Obilo village""/>
</div>
<div>Min Akello was still strong. She took care of young Okumu. She cooked for him. She washed his clothes. She nursed him when he was sick. She walked with him to school. It was only once in a while that her grown daughter, Okumu's aunt, came from town to check on them.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> Okumu was a very bright boy. Yet Okumu did not have any friends. No one to play with. No one to laugh with. No one to make up with after a fight.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The boy had a very big head. It was deformed. It was almost as large as the rest of his upper body. The other boys and girls did not want to be around Okumu, unless they were making fun of him. They mocked and teased him every day. He would always end up in tears. <br/> </div>
<div>Min Akello did not keep a mirror at home. But the boy felt the weight of his head and the deformity of his skull. The other children called him names such as ""lababa"" which meant ""idiot."" Yet he was the smartest student in his class.  <br/>Today, Okumu sat at the very back of the class, as always.  <br/> <br/>The boy used to sit all the way up front. He was quick to raise his hands back in the day; and he always answered the questions correctly. But then the other children started throwing peanuts and pieces of chalk at the back of his head. The boy shifted to the back of the class.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now, whenever the teacher turned to write on the blackboard, the other boys and girls turned around and made fun of Okumu. Ojara opened his mouth as wide as possible and grabbed each cheek with each hand and pulled them out as far as they could stretch, to show how ugly he thought Okumu was.  <br/>The other children laughed. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>""Ouiet children,"" Lapwony Achan, the soft-spoken English teacher said. Then, as soon as Lapwony Achan turned to face the black board, another boy, Omona, stuck a finger in his nostril and stretched out the skin as far as he could, to show how ugly he thought Okumu was. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The other children laughed. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>""Quiet children,"" Lapwony Achan said. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Then as soon as Lapwony Achan turned back to face the black board again, Anena, the girl from Kitgum Town went, ""Oink! Oink! Oink!"" like a pig, to show how ugly she thought Okumu was. <br/> </div>
<div>The other children laughed. Some laughed so hard that tears came streaming down their face. <br/> </div>
<div>""Quiet children,"" Lapwony Achan said. <br/> </div>
<div>This was all too much for Okumu. The boy ran from the back of the class and out the door. ""Come back Okumu. Do not mind them,"" Lapwony Achan pleaded. <br/> <img alt=""Okumu flees from school "" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/515576/pictures/original/20121031011955-OkumuFlees2.jpg?1351671600"" src="""" style="""" title=""Okumu runs from schhol""/>
</div>
<div>Okumu did not slow down. He ran even faster. Behind him, he could hear the loud laughter and the ""Oink, oink, oink,"" from the other children. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Okumu cried, and cried and did not stop crying even when he arrived home.  <br/>The boy ran into the small house he shared with Min Akello. Min Akello begged the boy to stop crying. <br/> </div>
<div>""Come out my son,"" Min Akello pleaded. ""I have cooked your favorite food, kwon-kal and bor. Come out, my handsome boy."" </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Kwon-kal, millet bread, and bor vegetables were indeed the boy's favorite food; but today, Okumu was too upset to eat.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>""No! I am ugly like Obibi, the monster with 10 eyes,"" Okumu wailed.  <br/>Min Akello sat outside by the door. Tears rolled down her wrinkled and aged cheeks.</div>
<div>
<img alt=""Okumu cries all night "" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/515571/pictures/original/20121031011106-BestOkumuCries.jpg?1351671079"" src="""" style="""" title=""Okumu crying ""/><br/> <br/>The taunts and abuses at school were becoming too much. She knew she could no longer sooth the boy with words.  <br/> <br/>She had noticed that recently, the boy's large head had grown even bigger.  <br/> <br/>Could it soon grow so large that the boy would no longer be able to stand on his feet? Could it grow so large that the boy would not be able to emerge from the house one day? <br/> <br/>These were the thoughts that tormented Min Akello. When Okumu was not around, she cried for the boy. <br/> <br/>All night, she sat by the door. What could make the boy stop crying? <br/> <br/>  <br/><strong>Chapter Two: The Little Man With The Drum</strong> <br/> <br/>Early the next morning, when the roosters began to crow, Min Akello heard a strange voice greeting her from outside.<br/> <br/>""Amoti do, Min Akello,"" the stranger declared, meaning ""I greet you, Min Akello.""<br/> <br/>Min Akello wondered. She had never heard this voice before. She knew everyone in Rwot Obilo. She even knew the people who lived over the hills towards Katikati. Who was this man? How did he know her name?<br/> <br/>""Amoti do, Min Akello,"" the stranger repeated.<br/> <br/>Should she reply? Min Akello was reluctant. How could she greet someone whom she could not even see since she was inside the house? Who would come so early and unannounced? Did he bring bad tidings of some calamity? These were troubling questions.<br/> <br/>The boy was still crying.<br/> <br/>""It is not good for a young boy to cry without stopping,"" the stranger declared. ""This must stop.""<br/> <br/>Who was this man? What did he know about Okumu? What did he mean when he said the crying must stop? Did he mean to harm the boy?<br/> <br/>""Who are you?"" Min Akello demanded, sternly. ""I tell you that I am not alone. I will cry uduro and all of Rwot Obilo will tear your limbs to pieces if you try to harm the boy.""<br/> <br/>Uduro was a piercing, shrill sound of distress that women made when faced with danger, in this part of the world.<br/> <br/>""Mmmm!! Since when do people in Acholi speak words without showing themselves?"" the stranger asked. ""Why not come out? I come in peace. If I meant harm, could I not have set fire to your house while you were asleep and ran away?"" <br/> <br/>These words spoken by the stranger made sense. Min Akello opened the door. She looked out and was surprised to find no one standing in front of her. <br/> <br/>""Amoti do, Min Akello,"" the stranger said. <br/> <br/>When Min Akello looked down, she was so startled that she almost fell to the ground. There, before her, stood the tiniest man she had ever seen in all the many years of her life. The little man barely reached Min Akello's own knees. <br/> <br/>Next to the little man, on the ground, was a beautiful drum whose surface was made of tanned crocodile skin.,The man himself was barely taller than the drum.<br/> <br/>""Amoti do,"" the little man repeated.<br/> <br/>""Amoti do, bene,"" Min Akello responded.<br/> <br/>The stranger lifted the drum gently. He pressed it against his chest with his left hand and pounded ,on it with his right hand three times. The most beautiful melodious music emanated from the drum.<br/> <br/>""This is for the boy,"" the stranger said, placing the drum back on the ground. ""No one but the boy is allowed to beat this drum. Otherwise calamity shall visit those who defy my command.""</div>
<div>
<img alt=""Old man and the drum"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/515567/pictures/original/20121031010131-BestIndieGoOkumuDrum.jpg?1351670557"" src="""" style="""" title=""The old man delivers the drum""/><br/> <br/>Then, with that warning, the stranger turned and walked away.<br/> <br/>""Who are you?"" Min Akello demanded, still puzzled. ""What do they call you? Where is your village? Who are your relatives? How do you know me?"" <br/><br/>The little man ignored all these questions. He walked pass the chickens who did not even run away or move out of his way. He was so tiny they were not sure whether to be afraid or not. He walked along the narrow path leading to the main road from Min Akello's home. Then, as suddenly as he had appeared, he was gone.<br/> <br/>Min Akello shook her head. She did not know what to make of this strange encounter with the little man. <br/> <br/>Then she realized that Okumu was now standing right next to her. The boy was no longer crying. The boy lifted the drum and held it up high. He wore a huge smile; from ear to ear.<br/> <br/>This was something that Min Akello had not seen in a very long time and it warmed her heart. She wiped away her tears before the boy looked up at her.<br/> <br/>The boy sat down and placed the drum between his legs. Then he started pounding on the drum with the palm of both hands.This time, Min Akello was so amazed that she actually did collapse.<br/> <br/>The boy had never pounded on a drum before. Yet the most melodious sounds now flowed from the drum and enveloped the surroundings. The drumbeat traveled across all of Rwot Obilo. <br/> <br/>It was a sound that even the best drummers in all of Acholi had never summoned from their drums. <br/> <br/>Some of the best drummers in the country came from Rwot Obilo. There was Onen, who was born in Katikati, but who grew up in Rwot Obilo. There was Kilama whose parents moved to Rwot Obilo from Custom, Corner. Then there was Kidega, who was so good, they called him ""lapwony,"" or the ""teacher."" <br/> <br/>Finally, there was Otoo, who was called ""bwul"" or ""drum."" <br/> <br/>When any of these men pounded on their drums, grown men stopped tilling their land and began dancing at once. Women removed the loads they were carrying on their head and began to shake their waist back and forth.<br/> <br/>But none of these great Acholi drummers had ever been able to produce the kind of beautiful music that came from Okumu's drum today. Within a short time, men and women began to appear at Min Akello's home to marvel at the sound coming from the boy's drum. <br/> <br/>Suddenly, no one was talking about the boy's head or calling him names such as ""lababa"" or ""obibi"" anymore. <br/> <br/>The boy stood up and placed the drum atop his head. He started walking along the path leading to the main road.
<div>
<br/>""My son. Where are you going?"" Min Akello asked., <br/><br/>""I am going to school,"" Okumu said. <br/><br/>Min Akello marveled. The boy did not like going to school because of the ugly names the other children called him. <br/><br/>This was a very confusing morning for Min Akello.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>[On November 18, I added another sample -- which follows below]</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<p><strong>Chapter Three: Ojara's Big Lips   </strong></p>
<p>When the boy started pounding on the drum again men and women emerged from their homesteads and rushed to the road. Even the birds hovered overhead and sang. Wild animals, including gazelles, leapt, as if following the drumbeat, by the road side.   </p>
<p>The men and women broke out in dance. Rwot Obilo had not seen such festivity for many years. </p>
<p>The men, women and children accompanied Okumu all the way to Rwot Obilo primary. </p>
<p>Hearing the commotion, the headmaster, Lapwony Odong, came and stood in front of the school's gate. He marveled at the huge crowd following Okumu. The boy stopped playing the drum when he saw Odong.   </p>
<p>""Man gin ango?"" headmaster Odong inquired, meaning, ""What is this?"" </p>
<p>In response, the boy pounded on the drum. ""Dung, dung, dung. Dung, dung, dung.""   </p>
<p>To his great surprise, headmaster Odong, who was no longer young, found himself shuffling his legs while thrusting his chest rythmically, back and forth, while moving in a circle. This was the dance preferred by Acholi men. </p>
<p>""Okumu, who taught you to beat the drum like that?"" headmaster Odong asked.  </p>
<p>""Lapwony Odong, who taught you to dance like that?"" one of the teachers asked. </p>
<p>Okumu laughed. He had a new confidence today. He told the headmaster about the mysterious visitor who had delivered the gift that morning before disappearing without explanation.  </p>
<p>""I am the only one allowed to play the drum. Anybody else will bring calamity,"" Okumu explained. </p>
<p>The crowd that had followed him was waiting for the boy to beat  the drum.   </p>
<p>""No more drum beating for now,"" Odong said. ""This is now time for our children to learn from books. Go back to your homes if you are not a pupil in this school."" </p>
<p>There was some grumbling. But the men and women left. They wanted their children to be taught by the teachers.   </p>
<p>In class, Lapwony Chuchana had a hard time teaching geography today. </p>
<p>""N-I-L-E...,"" she said, spelling out the great river. ""What is the name of the river?"" </p>
<p>She drew on the blackboard, the long, bending river, winding up Africa's neck, starting from its beginning in Lake Victoria.  </p>
<p>All the children were distracted. All eyes rested on Okumu's lovely drum.  </p>
<p>""Pay attention children!"" Chuchana commanded.  </p>
<p>But every time she turned her back from the class to draw maps on the  blackboard, all the children turned their attention to Okumu.  </p>
<p>Today, the children were not making ugly faces. They were not calling Okumu an ""Obibi"" or ""lababa"" or ""ukwan.""  </p>
<p>This time they admired the drum.   </p>
<p>Before midday lunch, Lapwony Odong entered the classroom.   </p>
<p>The children all stood up to hear what the headmaster had to say. He whispered some words to Lapwony Chuchana and then walked out.   </p>
<p>""Okumu let me see you outside,"" Lapwony Chuchana said. </p>
<p>This could not be good. Whenever Lapwong Odong came to summon a  student it meant the boy or girl was going to be caned as punishment for some offense he or she had committed.  </p>
<p>When Okumu and Lapwony Chuchana joined Lapwony Odong outside, they found him wearing a huge smile  </p>
<p>instead. </p>
<p>""You have been blessed with a great gift Okumu, you hear?"" the headmaster said.  </p>
<p>""Yes, I hear,"" the boy said. </p>
<p>""You must obey the warning that came with it, you hear?""  </p>
<p>""Yes, I hear,"" the boy responded. </p>
<p>""Do not allow any other student to even hold the drum, you hear?""  </p>
<p>""Yes, I hear,"" Okumu said, firmly nodding his head, up and down. </p>
<p>Then one of the older boys started hitting on the rusty iron rim-of-a-wheel, tied to a tree branch, which served as the school's bell. The children ran out of the open classroom doors to play on the soccer field.  </p>
<p>Okumu liked to read. So he went and sat under the shades of a mango tree and read a book that Lapwong Chuchana had given him. </p>
<p>Soon, he was surrounded by children from his class and from other classes.  </p>
<p>""Beat the drum for us,"" Ojara, a very mean boy from Okumu's class, ordered.  </p>
<p>""I shall not play,"" Okumu said. ""Lapwony Odong said I must not."" </p>
<p>""Beat the drum!"" Ojara demanded.  </p>
<p>""No, I shall not,"" Okumu said.  </p>
<p>Suddenly, Ojara tried to grab the drum. Okumu held on tight to it. The two boys struggled. Then Ojara pushed Okumu back and his  friend, Bosco, tripped him. Okumu fell on his back and the drum came free of his grip.  </p>
<p>Ojara grabbed the drum. </p>
<p>""Give it back to me! Give it back to me!"" Okumu begged.  </p>
<p>The other children laughed at Okumu and started taunting him again. </p>
<p>""Everyone in Rwot Obilo can fit inside Okumu's big head,"" Ojara said.  </p>
<p>The boys and girls laughed at Okumu.  </p>
<p>""Okumu is so ugly even a baboon would run away from him,"" said an older girl called Amwa, from a primary six class. </p>
<p>The boys and girls laughed at Okumu.  </p>
<p>""Okumu is so ugly, his father and his mother abandoned him,"" Bosco said.  </p>
<p>The boys and girls laughed. </p>
<p>""Okumu is so ugly, I would rather marry obibi,"" Angelina said.   </p>
<p>The boys and girls laughed.  </p>
<p>This was just too much for Okumu. He covered his eyes with his hands and burst into tears. The boys and girls  </p>
<p>formed a circle and surrounded him. Okumu was pushed back into the center of the circle. The children jeered at  </p>
<p>him. Okumu tried to run away. Bosco tripped him again and he fell flat on his face. </p>
<p>The boys and girls laughed.  </p>
<p>Then Ojara asked everyone to follow him and he led the boys and girls to the middle of the soccer field. </p>
<p>""If this ugly boy can play the drum, I can do it 10 times better,"" Ojara said. </p>
<p>Ojara started pounding on the drum. The sound produced was not melodious at all. It sounded like the crash of thunder. Indeed the clouds began to darken ominously and lightning flashed.  </p>
<p>One of the girls screamed and pointed at Ojara. All the boys and girls started laughing. Right before their eyes, Ojara's lips were beginning to swell. His lips stretched so quickly that they were soon resting on the soccer field. They continued to grow. They started approaching the children, like a snake. </p>
<p>Another girl screamed.   </p>
<p>The children turned towards Bosco. The boy's feet were now huge and still growing quickly.  </p>
<p>Then someone else screamed.  </p>
<p>The children turned towards Amwa. Her ears were huge. They grew so quickly that they soon reached the ground. </p>
<p>All this was too much for the children. The cruel taunts and laughter had disappeared from their lips. They started running for their lives instead.   </p>
<p>When the teachers came to see what all the commotion was about, they also started running for the gates. Some teachers even ran and left children behind them. </p>
<p>Ojara tried to run but he kept tripping on his own lips. He started  crying for his mother. ""Ma konya! Ma konya! Ma konya!"" Ojara cried, meaning ""My mother, save me!""  </p>
<p>Bosco tried to run but fell flat on his face. He started crying for his father. ""Ba konya! Ba konya! Ba konya!"" Bosco cried, meaning ""My father, save me!"" </p>
<p>Amwa tried to run but fell flat on her face because her feet got tangled with her ears. She started crying for any one to help her. ""Ujone ukonya! Ujone ukonya! Ujone ukonya!"" Amwa cried, meaning ""Someone, save me!""  </p>
<p>Okumu was the only one left with Ojara and Bosco and Amwa. He did not laugh at Ojara and Bosco and Amwa. He  did not taunt Ojara and Bosco and Amwa.  </p>
<p>Okumu approached the drum slowly. He stepped over Ojara's lips, and over Bosco's feet, and over Amwa's ears. He did not want to trip over them.  </p>
<p>The boy lifted the drum and started pounding. ""Dung, dung, dung! Dung, dung, dung!"" </p>
<p>Suddenly the melodious music was back. Suddenly, Ojara's lips, and Bosco's feet, and Amwa's ears returned to their normal size. </p>
<p>Ojara stood and ran. Bosco stood and ran. Amwa stood and ran. They did not look back.   </p>
<p>[On November 25 I added another sample chapter -- which follows below. The book has a total of 15 chapters]</p>
<p><strong>Chapter Four: Okumu Flees From Home</strong></p>
<table cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" style=""width: 769px;""><tbody><tr>
<td valign=""middle"">
<p>Just this morning Okumu was a happy boy. The people of Rwot Obilo had followed him</p>
<p>all the wayto the school dancing and singing to the music from his drum. But then Ojara,</p>
<p>and Boscoe and Amwa had rejected his warnings not to touch the drum. </p>
<p>Now, Okumu found himself standing on the playing field alone. All the other children had run away.</p>
<p>All the teachers had run away. Even headmaster Odong was gone.  </p>
<p>Okumu was alone with his drum. Not even a single bird was flying overhead.</p>
<p>The gazelles and other animals were not there by the road side. </p>
<p>This was too much for the boy. He tucked the drum underneath his arm and ran back home.</p>
<p>Along the way, he noticed that most of the homesteads were abandoned. Where was everybody?</p>
<p>Were the people hiding from him and the drum? Did they fear that the lips, and the feet, and the</p>
<p>ears of their children would grow?  </p>
<p>The boy panicked. He ran faster. When he reached near his home, he could see a huge crowd on</p>
<p>the compound. He veered off the main path so that no one could see him as he approached.</p>
<p>Okumu followed a narrower path that took him to the back of his grandmother's house. </p>
<p>The boy could hear Ojara's father, Kilama, complaining about him to Min Akello, in front of their house.   </p>
<p>""That boy Okumu is lajok,"" Ojara's father said, referring to Okumu as a sorcerer.</p>
<p>""He placed a curse on my son and caused his lips to swell until they reached the ground.</p>
<p>Everyone saw this with their own eyes.""  </p>
<p>""That is bad! That is bad! That is bad!"" the people of Rwot Obilo chorused.  </p>
<p>The women and men shook their heads in disapproval of the boy.  </p>
<p>""Those are true words spoken by Kilama,"" Bosco's father, Oringa, now said to Min Akello.</p>
<p>""He placed a curse upon my own son and caused his feet to grow until it was as big as your house.</p>
<p>Everyone saw this with their own eyes."" </p>
<p>There were more grumblings of disapproval from the people of Rwot Obilo.  </p>
<p>""Kilama and Oringa speak the truth,"" Amwa's father, Okwera now said, in a loud voice.</p>
<p>""My own daughter's ears became larger than the ears of an elephant. Everyone saw this with their</p>
<p>own eyes.""  </p>
<p>""But what kind of boy is this?"" one of the villagers demanded.  </p>
<p>""My child is a good boy. Please do not harm him,"" Min Akello pleaded. ""Perhaps it was the drum.""  </p>
<p>""We cannot allow the boy to keep the drum,"" Kilama said.   </p>
<p>""The boy can stay in Rwot Obilo but the drum must go,"" Oringa said. </p>
<p>""You must obey us! You hear?"" Okwera demanded.  </p>
<p>""Yes, the drum must go!"" the people of Rwot Obilo chorused. </p>
<p>""Otherwise we shall have no choice but to chase you and the boy,"" Oringa said.</p>
<p>""Do you hear us?""   </p>
<p>""I hear you,"" Min Akello said, in a quivering tone.  </p>
<p>There was a sadness and fear in Min Akello's voice that Okumu had never heard before. </p>
<p>""We must burn that drum at once,"" Kilama insisted. ""Where is the boy?""   </p>
<p>""The boy has not returned from school,"" Min Akello said. </p>
<p>""Min Akello, do you speak the truth?"" Kilama asked, in a harsh tone.  </p>
<p>""I speak the truth with my own mouth,"" Min Akello said. </p>
<p>""Very well. We shall return at the break of dawn for the drum,"" Kilama said. ""You hear us?""  </p>
<p>""I hear you,"" poor old Min Akello said.  </p>
<p>Okumu did not want to bring any trouble for his grandmother. But he also did not want</p>
<p>to surrender </p>
<p>the drum to Kilama and Oringa and Okwera. Who knew what calamity would be visited</p>
<p>on the people of</p>
<p>Rwot Obilo if someone else played the drum? He would be blamed and the people</p>
<p>would probably</p>
<p>burn down their home. Where would his grandmother stay? </p>
<p>Okumu was saddened. What was he to do? He would have to get rid of the drum himself.</p>
<p>He would search for the little man until he found him. He would return the drum to the stranger.  </p>
<p>The boy started running away towards Bungatira forest. When he reached there he stopped</p>
<p>to gather his courage.</p>
<p>The thick trees rose high towards the sky. For a minute he was almost sure he saw some</p>
<p>of the tree branches</p>
<p>reaching down to touch him. Was that an outline of eyes on one of the trees? Okumu had</p>
<p>never been inside the</p>
<p>forest and he had heard stories about children and grownups disappearing inside the thick</p>
<p>dark forest.</p>
<p>He could already hear the sounds of the strange animals that lived inside the forest.</p>
<p>Would he come out alive on the other side? Would he see his grandmother again? </p>
<p>The boy closed his eyes and dashed into the forest following the narrow footpath.</p>
<p>He ran and kept running.</p>
<p>It was so dark that he could not tell whether it was still daytime or night time.</p>
<p>He heard the owls.</p>
<p>Then there were strange sounds he had never heard before.  </p>
<p>""Awuuu! Awuuu! Awuuuu!"" </p>
<p>What could that be?  </p>
<p>""Hee-ya! Hee-ya! Hee-ya! </p>
<p>What could that be? </p>
<p>""Nyakar! Nyakar! Nyakar!"" </p>
<p>What could that be?  </p>
<p>The boy was terrified and he ran even faster with the drum safely tucked</p>
<p>under his arms.  </p>
<p>Okumu saw wild animals, including giants ones, running in different</p>
<p>directions throughout the forest.</p>
<p>Other times he could only see their shining eyes at a distance.</p>
<p>What was that? Was it Obibi the feared</p>
<p>10-eyed ogre or were those five hyenas standing next to each other?</p>
<p>There was no time to find out;</p>
<p>the boy ran as fast as his short legs could carry him.  </p>
<p>Then the boy tripped and fell and the drum flew out of his hand.</p>
<p>The boy was rubbing his sore knees</p>
<p>when he noticed that the thick brown log he had tripped on was</p>
<p>suddenly moving. It was then that the boy</p>
<p>realized it was actually a huge python. The great snake was now</p>
<p>curling its long body around the drum.</p>
<p>The boy gathered courage and grabbed the top part of the drum.</p>
<p>He pulled with all his strength and the drum came free.  </p>
<p>Okumu fell on his back with the drum back in his grips.</p>
<p>The python gave him an angry look and flashed his fangs.</p>
<p>Okumu pounded on the drum. Instead of attacking him the great</p>
<p>sneak rose and twisted and turned as if dancing to the music.</p>
<p>Okumu turned and ran farther into the forest, glancing behind him,</p>
<p>now and then, to make sure the snake was not</p>
<p>chasing after him.  The python did not follow but the boy just kept running.   </p>
<p>Okumu ran until his feet could no longer carry him forward. Suddenly,</p>
<p>he felt a slight coolness in the air.</p>
<p>He had reached the banks of a river. The boy did not know it but this</p>
<p>was the river Nile that his teacher, Lapwon Chuchana,</p>
<p>had spoken about in class.   </p>
<p>Because of the Great drought, the water level had dropped very low</p>
<p>and the river was almost dry.</p>
<p>The water level barely reached Okumu's waist. He used the cusp</p>
<p>of both hands to form a cup and he drank</p>
<p>some water from the river.  </p>
<p>The boy was very tired. He curled up on the dried grass</p>
<p>beneath a huge Tugo tree and fell asleep.  </p>
<p>Okumu dreamed that Kilama, Oringa, and Okwera were all</p>
<p>chasing after him and demanding</p>
<p>that he surrender the drum to them.....</p>

WHY YOUNG OKUMU HATES SCHOOL
My name is MILTON ALLIMADI and I wrote ""Okumu And His Magical Drum"" a story about a young boy with the grotesquely huge head who is teased so viciously that most days he doesn't want to go to school. 
 
Okumu lives with his grandmother Min Akello, in the village of Bungatira. He cries all night because of the bullying.  
 
One day a mysterious little old man visits and gives Okumu a beautiful drum that allows him to play the most beautiful music that anyone had ever heard before.,The stranger warns Okumu that he's the only person allowed to play this drum -- to pound on it.   

The bullies at school laugh at the warning. They beat up Okumu and steal his drum. But when the biggest bully pounds on the drum, instead of beautiful music, his ears grow so large that it becomes bigger than an elephant's. Another bully's feet grow so large that he trips over them. Another bully's lips grow so long that it reaches the ground. All the other kids and even the teachers are terrified and run. 
The villagers are angry and they surround grandma Min Akello's house. They say if Okumu doesn't surrender the drum so they can destroy it, they would chase him and his grandma away and burn their home. When Okumu hears this he runs into the dreaded Bungatira forest. He hopes to find the mysterious old man so he can return the drum.  
Okumu has to survive giant snakes, wild animals and Obibi the 10-eyed monster before he finally makes it through the forest. He's tired and falls asleep on the banks of the great river Nile whose water level had fallen because of a drought.  
Okumu wakes up sad and lonely. He cries because he wants to be home. He starts pounding on the drum hoping the music would cheer him up. Lo and behold! the water level begins to rise on the river Nile. Suddenly the fish begin to jump high into the sky, dancing to the music and twisting in mid-air before plunging back into the water. But some of the fish jump so high into the air, instead of dropping back into the river, they fall by the river bank right next to Okumu. Soon there is a mountain of fish by the river's bank.  

Okumu was so delighted and having such a wonderful time he didn't notice two hungry fishermen from Palabek village sneaking up behind him.  
The fishermen had not caught any fish for months. They could not believe their eyes when they saw all the colorful fish dropping by the river bank just waiting to be picked because of the drum's magical powers. 
The fishermen grabbed Okumu and tied him up. He struggled and cried in vain. The fishermen packed the fish in their huge bags and ran off with the boy's drum. They left Okumu there hoping he would be devoured by wild animals. The fishermen knew they would be welcomed like heroes when they returned home with food.   

Ayom the monkey heard Okumu's cries and emerged from the forest. Okumu begged Ayom to untie him but Ayom didn't understand the boy's strange language and wondered why the boy couldn't speak his own language. Okumu feared that if Ayom left he would be at the mercy of wild animals.  
 
Later, when a search party from Bungatira village saw that the people of Palabek had Okumu's drum in their possession, and when they couldn't find the boy, they concluded that he had been killed. So they started preparing for war with the people of Palabek.   
So what happens next? Will Ayom help free Okumu before he's eaten by wild animals? Will he find the fishermen who stole his drum? Will he ever see his home and his grandmother again? Will the people of Bungatira and the people of Palabek go to war? 
These are some of the many questions that are answered in the rest of the story ""Okumu And His Magical Drum.""  
Okumu is a book for all age groups. My four year old niece Alysa loves it.

My grownup friends, in their 20s, 50s, and even 70s also love it. I also sent the story to a very famous grownup and this is what he said -- words that will appear on the back jacket: 
""Okumu converts awful bullies into admirers after he survives the 10-eyed monster and captivity! His friend Ayom the monkey mocks humans who can't understand his language. The fish are dancing. Okumu helps prevent a war. This is a beautiful story that should never end.""
Guess who this famous person was? None other than Dr. Bill Cosby -- yes, the one of The Cosby Show fame and many other productions. He's a generous philanthropist, educator, entertainer and author of several books.  
I agree that the story should never end. That's why I'm already working on a second story where Okumu rescues a girl named Anena who's also bullied at another school. The two then team up with Ayom and they embark on a journey to rescue other victims of bullying.  
I've posted the first two chapters from the ""Okumu.."" manuscript so you can get a taste of this story. Journalism is my regular day job; covering crime, corruption, disasters and even murder. So writing ""Okumu.."" was great fun. I wrote the first draft on a notebook with a pen -- sometimes on the subway and sometimes while waiting for my steamed fish order at this joint in Harlem. 
Now, with your support I can have ""Okumu And His Magical Drum"" ready for shipping by the first week of December so everyone can enjoy it or send it out as a Christmas, a Kwanzaa, or as a New Year's gift to friends, family and loved ones. 
With your support: the artist Brigette Burns gets to finish the illustrations; a graphic designer produces a beautiful layout; and we get print and ship the book to you and other supporters. 
All the gifts you get in return for your support is outlined on the side of this page.

THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU..... 
  
WHERE WILL THE MONEY GO?: Your support for my Indiegogo campaign will help bring Okumu to life. Your support will allow me to: pay Brigette to finish all the drawings needed for the book; pay for a nice layout work of the book; pay for printing copies of the book; pay to build a decent website for promoting the book; and cover the cost of shipping the book to people like you.   
I also plan to produce Okumu and Ayom T-shirts.  
WHO IS THE AUTHOR, MILTON ALLIMADI?:  
 
I grew up in Uganda, in Tanzania and here in the U.S. My late father, Otema Allimadi, was ambassador to Washington, D.C.  

When my family returned to Uganda, we lived in Bungatira village, where I remember hearing beautiful folk tales called ""ododo"" from grandmothers while sitting outdoors around a fire at night. In most of these stories ""Apwoyo"" the rabbit always outwits bigger animals who want to harm him. When I was 10, I started telling my own stories to my younger siblings. At that time only Andrew, Walter and Sue were old enough to understand. My siblings enjoyed my stories so much that they even gave me their daily allotment of cookies! One day I was tired so I had a truck run over the main character Oyo. My sister Sue burst into tears. I quickly resurrected Oyo.  
One day, my family had to leave Uganda in a hurry. General Idi Amin was doing nasty things to folks and tried to kill our dad. My family lived in Tanzania for almost 10 years. My family went back to Uganda years later after Amin himself left in a hurry; I came back to the United States.  
My father didn't think telling stories, or making movies, my other dream, were serious professions. I studied economics at Syracuse University. Later, I studied journalism at the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University.  
Many years ago, I bumped into Bill Cosby while jogging. About 10 years later, I wrote him a letter with my idea to start a weekly newspaper. He sent me a check for the seed money.  
That's how I launched The Black Star News with two friends Ben Otunu and Mana Kasongo, who's now a doctor.
I Spend much of my time during the day HELPING OTHER people by reporting on and covering stories about injustices people face every day. Stories that are ignored by the major media -- even when the cases are compelling. 
I've always cheered for underdogs. Here are a few stories I've covered in The Black Star News: 
I wrote about an elderly Jewish Holocaust survivor who was in her 70s and now 80s, Mrs. Gizella Weisshaus, who filed a lawsuit against Swiss banks for looted assets of Nazi Holocaust survivors. Other victims joined her in a class action and the banks settled for over $1 billion. It turns out that her own lawyer who initially helped her with that case was shady and also stole money from her. He even stole $500,000 he had won from the Swiss banks on behalf of another elderly Holocaust survivor; didn't give her a penny, and later ""donated"" $7,000 of her own money for her funeral. Partly due to my stories that lawyer has since been disbarred. The same lawyer had wanted to represent African American clients who were preparing to sue for Reparations.
I also wrote about a Taiwanese immigrant named Sunny Shue, who was fighting against some banks that wanted to wrongfully foreclose on his house -- and the bank was aided by several biased rulings by a New York State Supreme Court judge. Sunny on several occasions told me he feared for his life. I published several articles about his case. Sunny made a video, which is now posted on YouTube expressing fear for his life. It turns out that Sunny was right. He eventually died under very mysterious circumstances which are yet to be investigated by the New York Police Department -- I am still working on that case together with a friend of Sunny's named Wil Galison who is now also a freelance writer for The Black Star News.  
Another story I recently wrote is about a man named Benjamin Cunningham who was dragged one morning out of his house here in New York by Federal marshals without a warrant on suspicion that he was allegedly harboring his brother who lived in North Carolina and was a suspect in a drug related case. It turns out that the Marshals were wrong and Cunningham had not even been in touch with that brother who was later arrested in another state. 
Cunningham was beaten during the search and even struck by a bus as he tried to flee the assault. Later, a Magistrate Judge recommended that Cunningham's case should go to trial and be decided by a jury. But a trial judge ignored the magistrate judge's recommendation and ruled in favor of the Marshals (U.S. government) who argued that they had qualified immunity and dismissed the case.  
While these kind of stories sometimes help people as in the case of Mrs. Weisshaus -- who herself is a formidable fighter and is still fighting other cases of injustice against her-- they are also very draining. (My next book will focus on The Black Star News and the kind of cases I cover).
In addition to my own reporting, every Monday, I teach a free journalism workshop in Brooklyn to ordinary people in the community so that they too can learn to report and write about news in their neighborhoods.  
So writing children's stories is also a nice way for me to relax and eventually share a wonderful story with young readers and adults. Since The Black Star News is a small independent newspaper the company can't devote resources to publish a children's book such as ""Okumu And His Magical Drum.""  Also, even though a book agent loves the manuscript that process takes a long time and there's no guarantee of publication.  
And while philanthropist Cosby was helpful with seed money to launch The Black Star, he supports thousands of other projects and one can't go back to drink from the same well every day.  
So that's where you can come into the picture and help bring Okumu to life by supporting this campaign for independent publishing of Okumu. 
Sometimes as adults we become BORING and forget about some of the things we used to love and enjoy. A few months ago when I was stuck on the subway train here in New York City I pulled out a notebook and started writing Okumu.
I tried writing the story many years ago but never went more than a few pages. This time, I found that I couldn't stop writing.
Within a very short time I had finished ""Okumu And His Magical Drum."" Most of my friends who've read sample chapters love Okumu. I really hope you too love the boy and his friend Ayom the monkey. I'm almost finished with a second book.  
So, if you'd like to share in Okumu's adventures, please support this Indiegogo campaign. Send a link to someone you know. Who knows, if we get enough support, one day we could make an animated movie version of Okumu and Ayom. Maybe I could end up making films after all....  
HOW MUCH IS THE BOOK?: The book (Hard Cover) will be priced @ $25. Please look at the rewards section to see how much to add for U.S. or international postage.
I will try to start sending out orders by the third week of December, 2012 so people can get the book during this holiday season. While I can't guarantee you'd get the book before the end of the holidays because of the volume of mail that's sent out in December, I believe Okumu will still be a timeless gift even if you get it in January, 2013.  
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HIRE THE ARTISTS?: If you like the Artist Brigette Burns's work take a look at http://brigettemarieburns.weebly.com for more of her work. If you'd like to hire her too contact her at contactbrigette@hotmail.com 
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO DO A READING AND BOOK SIGNING?: Yes, I would be happy to after the book comes out in December, 2012. You can send me an email now at mallimadi@gmail.com to discuss and make plans.  
I've already finished the first draft of a follow up story so if enough people like Okumu maybe we will have a series.
 
 
HERE ARE TWO SAMPLE CHAPTERS
 OKUMU AND HIS MAGICAL DRUM  Chapter One: The Ugly Boy   Okumu's parents and five siblings perished during the Great Famine in Palabek and that's how the poor boy ended up with his Grandmother, Min Akello in Rwot Obilo village.  Min Akello's husband, Tung Dyang, had passed away long ago.  

Min Akello was still strong. She took care of young Okumu. She cooked for him. She washed his clothes. She nursed him when he was sick. She walked with him to school. It was only once in a while that her grown daughter, Okumu's aunt, came from town to check on them.
 
 Okumu was a very bright boy. Yet Okumu did not have any friends. No one to play with. No one to laugh with. No one to make up with after a fight.  
 
The boy had a very big head. It was deformed. It was almost as large as the rest of his upper body. The other boys and girls did not want to be around Okumu, unless they were making fun of him. They mocked and teased him every day. He would always end up in tears.  
Min Akello did not keep a mirror at home. But the boy felt the weight of his head and the deformity of his skull. The other children called him names such as ""lababa"" which meant ""idiot."" Yet he was the smartest student in his class.  Today, Okumu sat at the very back of the class, as always.   The boy used to sit all the way up front. He was quick to raise his hands back in the day; and he always answered the questions correctly. But then the other children started throwing peanuts and pieces of chalk at the back of his head. The boy shifted to the back of the class.
 
Now, whenever the teacher turned to write on the blackboard, the other boys and girls turned around and made fun of Okumu. Ojara opened his mouth as wide as possible and grabbed each cheek with each hand and pulled them out as far as they could stretch, to show how ugly he thought Okumu was.  The other children laughed. 
 
""Ouiet children,"" Lapwony Achan, the soft-spoken English teacher said. Then, as soon as Lapwony Achan turned to face the black board, another boy, Omona, stuck a finger in his nostril and stretched out the skin as far as he could, to show how ugly he thought Okumu was. 
 
The other children laughed. 
 
""Quiet children,"" Lapwony Achan said. 
 
Then as soon as Lapwony Achan turned back to face the black board again, Anena, the girl from Kitgum Town went, ""Oink! Oink! Oink!"" like a pig, to show how ugly she thought Okumu was.  
The other children laughed. Some laughed so hard that tears came streaming down their face.  
""Quiet children,"" Lapwony Achan said.  
This was all too much for Okumu. The boy ran from the back of the class and out the door. ""Come back Okumu. Do not mind them,"" Lapwony Achan pleaded.  

Okumu did not slow down. He ran even faster. Behind him, he could hear the loud laughter and the ""Oink, oink, oink,"" from the other children. 
 
Okumu cried, and cried and did not stop crying even when he arrived home.  The boy ran into the small house he shared with Min Akello. Min Akello begged the boy to stop crying.  
""Come out my son,"" Min Akello pleaded. ""I have cooked your favorite food, kwon-kal and bor. Come out, my handsome boy."" 
 
Kwon-kal, millet bread, and bor vegetables were indeed the boy's favorite food; but today, Okumu was too upset to eat.
 
""No! I am ugly like Obibi, the monster with 10 eyes,"" Okumu wailed.  Min Akello sat outside by the door. Tears rolled down her wrinkled and aged cheeks.

 The taunts and abuses at school were becoming too much. She knew she could no longer sooth the boy with words.   She had noticed that recently, the boy's large head had grown even bigger.   Could it soon grow so large that the boy would no longer be able to stand on his feet? Could it grow so large that the boy would not be able to emerge from the house one day?  These were the thoughts that tormented Min Akello. When Okumu was not around, she cried for the boy.  All night, she sat by the door. What could make the boy stop crying?    Chapter Two: The Little Man With The Drum  Early the next morning, when the roosters began to crow, Min Akello heard a strange voice greeting her from outside. ""Amoti do, Min Akello,"" the stranger declared, meaning ""I greet you, Min Akello."" Min Akello wondered. She had never heard this voice before. She knew everyone in Rwot Obilo. She even knew the people who lived over the hills towards Katikati. Who was this man? How did he know her name? ""Amoti do, Min Akello,"" the stranger repeated. Should she reply? Min Akello was reluctant. How could she greet someone whom she could not even see since she was inside the house? Who would come so early and unannounced? Did he bring bad tidings of some calamity? These were troubling questions. The boy was still crying. ""It is not good for a young boy to cry without stopping,"" the stranger declared. ""This must stop."" Who was this man? What did he know about Okumu? What did he mean when he said the crying must stop? Did he mean to harm the boy? ""Who are you?"" Min Akello demanded, sternly. ""I tell you that I am not alone. I will cry uduro and all of Rwot Obilo will tear your limbs to pieces if you try to harm the boy."" Uduro was a piercing, shrill sound of distress that women made when faced with danger, in this part of the world. ""Mmmm!! Since when do people in Acholi speak words without showing themselves?"" the stranger asked. ""Why not come out? I come in peace. If I meant harm, could I not have set fire to your house while you were asleep and ran away?""  These words spoken by the stranger made sense. Min Akello opened the door. She looked out and was surprised to find no one standing in front of her.  ""Amoti do, Min Akello,"" the stranger said.  When Min Akello looked down, she was so startled that she almost fell to the ground. There, before her, stood the tiniest man she had ever seen in all the many years of her life. The little man barely reached Min Akello's own knees.  Next to the little man, on the ground, was a beautiful drum whose surface was made of tanned crocodile skin.,The man himself was barely taller than the drum. ""Amoti do,"" the little man repeated. ""Amoti do, bene,"" Min Akello responded. The stranger lifted the drum gently. He pressed it against his chest with his left hand and pounded ,on it with his right hand three times. The most beautiful melodious music emanated from the drum. ""This is for the boy,"" the stranger said, placing the drum back on the ground. ""No one but the boy is allowed to beat this drum. Otherwise calamity shall visit those who defy my command.""

 Then, with that warning, the stranger turned and walked away. ""Who are you?"" Min Akello demanded, still puzzled. ""What do they call you? Where is your village? Who are your relatives? How do you know me?"" The little man ignored all these questions. He walked pass the chickens who did not even run away or move out of his way. He was so tiny they were not sure whether to be afraid or not. He walked along the narrow path leading to the main road from Min Akello's home. Then, as suddenly as he had appeared, he was gone. Min Akello shook her head. She did not know what to make of this strange encounter with the little man.  Then she realized that Okumu was now standing right next to her. The boy was no longer crying. The boy lifted the drum and held it up high. He wore a huge smile; from ear to ear. This was something that Min Akello had not seen in a very long time and it warmed her heart. She wiped away her tears before the boy looked up at her. The boy sat down and placed the drum between his legs. Then he started pounding on the drum with the palm of both hands.This time, Min Akello was so amazed that she actually did collapse. The boy had never pounded on a drum before. Yet the most melodious sounds now flowed from the drum and enveloped the surroundings. The drumbeat traveled across all of Rwot Obilo.  It was a sound that even the best drummers in all of Acholi had never summoned from their drums.  Some of the best drummers in the country came from Rwot Obilo. There was Onen, who was born in Katikati, but who grew up in Rwot Obilo. There was Kilama whose parents moved to Rwot Obilo from Custom, Corner. Then there was Kidega, who was so good, they called him ""lapwony,"" or the ""teacher.""  Finally, there was Otoo, who was called ""bwul"" or ""drum.""  When any of these men pounded on their drums, grown men stopped tilling their land and began dancing at once. Women removed the loads they were carrying on their head and began to shake their waist back and forth. But none of these great Acholi drummers had ever been able to produce the kind of beautiful music that came from Okumu's drum today. Within a short time, men and women began to appear at Min Akello's home to marvel at the sound coming from the boy's drum.  Suddenly, no one was talking about the boy's head or calling him names such as ""lababa"" or ""obibi"" anymore.  The boy stood up and placed the drum atop his head. He started walking along the path leading to the main road.

""My son. Where are you going?"" Min Akello asked., ""I am going to school,"" Okumu said. Min Akello marveled. The boy did not like going to school because of the ugly names the other children called him. This was a very confusing morning for Min Akello.
 
 
[On November 18, I added another sample -- which follows below]
 

Chapter Three: Ojara's Big Lips   
When the boy started pounding on the drum again men and women emerged from their homesteads and rushed to the road. Even the birds hovered overhead and sang. Wild animals, including gazelles, leapt, as if following the drumbeat, by the road side.   
The men and women broke out in dance. Rwot Obilo had not seen such festivity for many years. 
The men, women and children accompanied Okumu all the way to Rwot Obilo primary. 
Hearing the commotion, the headmaster, Lapwony Odong, came and stood in front of the school's gate. He marveled at the huge crowd following Okumu. The boy stopped playing the drum when he saw Odong.   
""Man gin ango?"" headmaster Odong inquired, meaning, ""What is this?"" 
In response, the boy pounded on the drum. ""Dung, dung, dung. Dung, dung, dung.""   
To his great surprise, headmaster Odong, who was no longer young, found himself shuffling his legs while thrusting his chest rythmically, back and forth, while moving in a circle. This was the dance preferred by Acholi men. 
""Okumu, who taught you to beat the drum like that?"" headmaster Odong asked.  
""Lapwony Odong, who taught you to dance like that?"" one of the teachers asked. 
Okumu laughed. He had a new confidence today. He told the headmaster about the mysterious visitor who had delivered the gift that morning before disappearing without explanation.  
""I am the only one allowed to play the drum. Anybody else will bring calamity,"" Okumu explained. 
The crowd that had followed him was waiting for the boy to beat  the drum.   
""No more drum beating for now,"" Odong said. ""This is now time for our children to learn from books. Go back to your homes if you are not a pupil in this school."" 
There was some grumbling. But the men and women left. They wanted their children to be taught by the teachers.   
In class, Lapwony Chuchana had a hard time teaching geography today. 
""N-I-L-E...,"" she said, spelling out the great river. ""What is the name of the river?"" 
She drew on the blackboard, the long, bending river, winding up Africa's neck, starting from its beginning in Lake Victoria.  
All the children were distracted. All eyes rested on Okumu's lovely drum.  
""Pay attention children!"" Chuchana commanded.  
But every time she turned her back from the class to draw maps on the  blackboard, all the children turned their attention to Okumu.  
Today, the children were not making ugly faces. They were not calling Okumu an ""Obibi"" or ""lababa"" or ""ukwan.""  
This time they admired the drum.   
Before midday lunch, Lapwony Odong entered the classroom.   
The children all stood up to hear what the headmaster had to say. He whispered some words to Lapwony Chuchana and then walked out.   
""Okumu let me see you outside,"" Lapwony Chuchana said. 
This could not be good. Whenever Lapwong Odong came to summon a  student it meant the boy or girl was going to be caned as punishment for some offense he or she had committed.  
When Okumu and Lapwony Chuchana joined Lapwony Odong outside, they found him wearing a huge smile  
instead. 
""You have been blessed with a great gift Okumu, you hear?"" the headmaster said.  
""Yes, I hear,"" the boy said. 
""You must obey the warning that came with it, you hear?""  
""Yes, I hear,"" the boy responded. 
""Do not allow any other student to even hold the drum, you hear?""  
""Yes, I hear,"" Okumu said, firmly nodding his head, up and down. 
Then one of the older boys started hitting on the rusty iron rim-of-a-wheel, tied to a tree branch, which served as the school's bell. The children ran out of the open classroom doors to play on the soccer field.  
Okumu liked to read. So he went and sat under the shades of a mango tree and read a book that Lapwong Chuchana had given him. 
Soon, he was surrounded by children from his class and from other classes.  
""Beat the drum for us,"" Ojara, a very mean boy from Okumu's class, ordered.  
""I shall not play,"" Okumu said. ""Lapwony Odong said I must not."" 
""Beat the drum!"" Ojara demanded.  
""No, I shall not,"" Okumu said.  
Suddenly, Ojara tried to grab the drum. Okumu held on tight to it. The two boys struggled. Then Ojara pushed Okumu back and his  friend, Bosco, tripped him. Okumu fell on his back and the drum came free of his grip.  
Ojara grabbed the drum. 
""Give it back to me! Give it back to me!"" Okumu begged.  
The other children laughed at Okumu and started taunting him again. 
""Everyone in Rwot Obilo can fit inside Okumu's big head,"" Ojara said.  
The boys and girls laughed at Okumu.  
""Okumu is so ugly even a baboon would run away from him,"" said an older girl called Amwa, from a primary six class. 
The boys and girls laughed at Okumu.  
""Okumu is so ugly, his father and his mother abandoned him,"" Bosco said.  
The boys and girls laughed. 
""Okumu is so ugly, I would rather marry obibi,"" Angelina said.   
The boys and girls laughed.  
This was just too much for Okumu. He covered his eyes with his hands and burst into tears. The boys and girls  
formed a circle and surrounded him. Okumu was pushed back into the center of the circle. The children jeered at  
him. Okumu tried to run away. Bosco tripped him again and he fell flat on his face. 
The boys and girls laughed.  
Then Ojara asked everyone to follow him and he led the boys and girls to the middle of the soccer field. 
""If this ugly boy can play the drum, I can do it 10 times better,"" Ojara said. 
Ojara started pounding on the drum. The sound produced was not melodious at all. It sounded like the crash of thunder. Indeed the clouds began to darken ominously and lightning flashed.  
One of the girls screamed and pointed at Ojara. All the boys and girls started laughing. Right before their eyes, Ojara's lips were beginning to swell. His lips stretched so quickly that they were soon resting on the soccer field. They continued to grow. They started approaching the children, like a snake. 
Another girl screamed.   
The children turned towards Bosco. The boy's feet were now huge and still growing quickly.  
Then someone else screamed.  
The children turned towards Amwa. Her ears were huge. They grew so quickly that they soon reached the ground. 
All this was too much for the children. The cruel taunts and laughter had disappeared from their lips. They started running for their lives instead.   
When the teachers came to see what all the commotion was about, they also started running for the gates. Some teachers even ran and left children behind them. 
Ojara tried to run but he kept tripping on his own lips. He started  crying for his mother. ""Ma konya! Ma konya! Ma konya!"" Ojara cried, meaning ""My mother, save me!""  
Bosco tried to run but fell flat on his face. He started crying for his father. ""Ba konya! Ba konya! Ba konya!"" Bosco cried, meaning ""My father, save me!"" 
Amwa tried to run but fell flat on her face because her feet got tangled with her ears. She started crying for any one to help her. ""Ujone ukonya! Ujone ukonya! Ujone ukonya!"" Amwa cried, meaning ""Someone, save me!""  
Okumu was the only one left with Ojara and Bosco and Amwa. He did not laugh at Ojara and Bosco and Amwa. He  did not taunt Ojara and Bosco and Amwa.  
Okumu approached the drum slowly. He stepped over Ojara's lips, and over Bosco's feet, and over Amwa's ears. He did not want to trip over them.  
The boy lifted the drum and started pounding. ""Dung, dung, dung! Dung, dung, dung!"" 
Suddenly the melodious music was back. Suddenly, Ojara's lips, and Bosco's feet, and Amwa's ears returned to their normal size. 
Ojara stood and ran. Bosco stood and ran. Amwa stood and ran. They did not look back.   
[On November 25 I added another sample chapter -- which follows below. The book has a total of 15 chapters]
Chapter Four: Okumu Flees From Home


Just this morning Okumu was a happy boy. The people of Rwot Obilo had followed him
all the wayto the school dancing and singing to the music from his drum. But then Ojara,
and Boscoe and Amwa had rejected his warnings not to touch the drum. 
Now, Okumu found himself standing on the playing field alone. All the other children had run away.
All the teachers had run away. Even headmaster Odong was gone.  
Okumu was alone with his drum. Not even a single bird was flying overhead.
The gazelles and other animals were not there by the road side. 
This was too much for the boy. He tucked the drum underneath his arm and ran back home.
Along the way, he noticed that most of the homesteads were abandoned. Where was everybody?
Were the people hiding from him and the drum? Did they fear that the lips, and the feet, and the
ears of their children would grow?  
The boy panicked. He ran faster. When he reached near his home, he could see a huge crowd on
the compound. He veered off the main path so that no one could see him as he approached.
Okumu followed a narrower path that took him to the back of his grandmother's house. 
The boy could hear Ojara's father, Kilama, complaining about him to Min Akello, in front of their house.   
""That boy Okumu is lajok,"" Ojara's father said, referring to Okumu as a sorcerer.
""He placed a curse on my son and caused his lips to swell until they reached the ground.
Everyone saw this with their own eyes.""  
""That is bad! That is bad! That is bad!"" the people of Rwot Obilo chorused.  
The women and men shook their heads in disapproval of the boy.  
""Those are true words spoken by Kilama,"" Bosco's father, Oringa, now said to Min Akello.
""He placed a curse upon my own son and caused his feet to grow until it was as big as your house.
Everyone saw this with their own eyes."" 
There were more grumblings of disapproval from the people of Rwot Obilo.  
""Kilama and Oringa speak the truth,"" Amwa's father, Okwera now said, in a loud voice.
""My own daughter's ears became larger than the ears of an elephant. Everyone saw this with their
own eyes.""  
""But what kind of boy is this?"" one of the villagers demanded.  
""My child is a good boy. Please do not harm him,"" Min Akello pleaded. ""Perhaps it was the drum.""  
""We cannot allow the boy to keep the drum,"" Kilama said.   
""The boy can stay in Rwot Obilo but the drum must go,"" Oringa said. 
""You must obey us! You hear?"" Okwera demanded.  
""Yes, the drum must go!"" the people of Rwot Obilo chorused. 
""Otherwise we shall have no choice but to chase you and the boy,"" Oringa said.
""Do you hear us?""   
""I hear you,"" Min Akello said, in a quivering tone.  
There was a sadness and fear in Min Akello's voice that Okumu had never heard before. 
""We must burn that drum at once,"" Kilama insisted. ""Where is the boy?""   
""The boy has not returned from school,"" Min Akello said. 
""Min Akello, do you speak the truth?"" Kilama asked, in a harsh tone.  
""I speak the truth with my own mouth,"" Min Akello said. 
""Very well. We shall return at the break of dawn for the drum,"" Kilama said. ""You hear us?""  
""I hear you,"" poor old Min Akello said.  
Okumu did not want to bring any trouble for his grandmother. But he also did not want
to surrender 
the drum to Kilama and Oringa and Okwera. Who knew what calamity would be visited
on the people of
Rwot Obilo if someone else played the drum? He would be blamed and the people
would probably
burn down their home. Where would his grandmother stay? 
Okumu was saddened. What was he to do? He would have to get rid of the drum himself.
He would search for the little man until he found him. He would return the drum to the stranger.  
The boy started running away towards Bungatira forest. When he reached there he stopped
to gather his courage.
The thick trees rose high towards the sky. For a minute he was almost sure he saw some
of the tree branches
reaching down to touch him. Was that an outline of eyes on one of the trees? Okumu had
never been inside the
forest and he had heard stories about children and grownups disappearing inside the thick
dark forest.
He could already hear the sounds of the strange animals that lived inside the forest.
Would he come out alive on the other side? Would he see his grandmother again? 
The boy closed his eyes and dashed into the forest following the narrow footpath.
He ran and kept running.
It was so dark that he could not tell whether it was still daytime or night time.
He heard the owls.
Then there were strange sounds he had never heard before.  
""Awuuu! Awuuu! Awuuuu!"" 
What could that be?  
""Hee-ya! Hee-ya! Hee-ya! 
What could that be? 
""Nyakar! Nyakar! Nyakar!"" 
What could that be?  
The boy was terrified and he ran even faster with the drum safely tucked
under his arms.  
Okumu saw wild animals, including giants ones, running in different
directions throughout the forest.
Other times he could only see their shining eyes at a distance.
What was that? Was it Obibi the feared
10-eyed ogre or were those five hyenas standing next to each other?
There was no time to find out;
the boy ran as fast as his short legs could carry him.  
Then the boy tripped and fell and the drum flew out of his hand.
The boy was rubbing his sore knees
when he noticed that the thick brown log he had tripped on was
suddenly moving. It was then that the boy
realized it was actually a huge python. The great snake was now
curling its long body around the drum.
The boy gathered courage and grabbed the top part of the drum.
He pulled with all his strength and the drum came free.  
Okumu fell on his back with the drum back in his grips.
The python gave him an angry look and flashed his fangs.
Okumu pounded on the drum. Instead of attacking him the great
sneak rose and twisted and turned as if dancing to the music.
Okumu turned and ran farther into the forest, glancing behind him,
now and then, to make sure the snake was not
chasing after him.  The python did not follow but the boy just kept running.   
Okumu ran until his feet could no longer carry him forward. Suddenly,
he felt a slight coolness in the air.
He had reached the banks of a river. The boy did not know it but this
was the river Nile that his teacher, Lapwon Chuchana,
had spoken about in class.   
Because of the Great drought, the water level had dropped very low
and the river was almost dry.
The water level barely reached Okumu's waist. He used the cusp
of both hands to form a cup and he drank
some water from the river.  
The boy was very tired. He curled up on the dried grass
beneath a huge Tugo tree and fell asleep.  
Okumu dreamed that Kilama, Oringa, and Okwera were all
chasing after him and demanding
that he surrender the drum to them.....",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","More than ten years ago now, the Society for Cultural Anthropology (SCA) launched an innovative website designed to extend the reach of its peer-reviewed journal. Since then, the site has expanded to include timely interventions like the Hot Spots series and anchored a widely admired graduate student mentoring program.
Earlier this year, the SCA made the decision to overhaul the site for a new generation of web users, prioritizing features like mobile friendliness, faster search, and accessibility for users with disabilities. The editorial team, led by Brad Weiss, Heather Paxson, and Christopher Nelson, have been working nonstop to get the site ready for a February 2019 launch. With the finish line approaching, Friends of Cultural Anthropology is setting out to raise the remaining funds needed to complete the job.

<p> </p>
<p>Sailing is such a fascinating means of transport and it’s so much more than that. It a way of living, a way of independence, a way of going to places where no one comes, a way of really going 100 % into nature. When does that still happen? So why cross an ocean then, you may wonder? An ocean passage is really a radical removal from it all, long enough to really disconnect from everything but nature. There is no wifi. No stress. No media. No system to comply with. No deadlines. No pressure. There is no way back! It’s back to basics. It’s hours of stargazing, it’s meeting dozens of dolphins and whales, it’s seeing the most pure sunsets and sunrises, it’s breathing the fresh ocean air. Day in day out. You become energized, oxygenated and fully alive. It’s loads of thinking about life and your purpose in it. When you crossed the big pond you'll feel accomplished and ready to take over the world! Last but not least, it’s the most sustainable way to travel. So why the Atlantic Ocean? To feel like Columbus! You don't have to imagine what I feels like to suddenly see land after days and days of ocean, you can experience it. When it turns winter in Europe the tradewinds pick up just in time to make your way sailing to the Caribbean. Every day it's gets a little warmer. Then arriving in the tropics with coconuts, rumpunch and steeldrum music at every beach corner is another dream becoming reality. When the hurricane season approaches boats make their way eastwards, to be just in time for European spring. Crossing the Atlantic Ocean is a expedition, though not the most challenging oceanpassage out there. It's a great starting point and will trigger you for more.  </p>

<h1>The Impact</h1>
<p>The hitchsailing book is part of a bigger mission:<b> to save the ocean</b>.</p>
<p><b>By creating this e-book I hope to encourage, inspire, and inform for adventure and ocean exploration. For one to experience the magic and the situation of the ocean, to experience the beauty of simple resourceful living, and then, act accordingly. </b></p>
<p>It’s since this big sailing adventure that I have really realized how bad the situation of our ocean is, and how dependent we are on it. I feel more responsible and motivated than ever to bring life back into the ocean.</p>
<p>My ocean explorations have shown me the tsunami of <b>challenges our oceans are facing. </b>In the middle of the Atlantic I fished water samples that appeared to be clear but had 47 tiny pieces of plastic. I’ve been zigzag sailing to avoid the hundreds of trawling fishing boats. I’ve stared at parades of plastic floating. I built sandcastles of plastic sand. I’ve been dancing with manta-rays in a plastic soup. I’ve been freediving looking for fish and couldn’t find any, on places where they’re supposed to be in abundance. <b>The ocean gets emptied, trashed, polluted and out of balance</b> because of our busy and demanding lifes on land. I have experienced these sad situations. And by going out on a boat for a while I have also experienced how very little we actually need. But we do need the ocean to live.</p>
<p>I love the ocean so I protect that. But It’s not about me. It’s about everyone, everyone’s kids and every life on the planet. <b>We are alive right now because of the oceans. Now the ocean needs to be kept alive by us.</b></p>
<p>People protect what they love. So <b>I want people to fall in love with the ocean.</b> To fall in love with the ocean and get most triggered to make a difference, I believe you have to experience the ocean. </p>

<p>Me in 5 words: oceanpreneur, explorer, mermaid, environmentalist, incentivizer.</p>
<p>During my 10 years of adventuring around the world there has been one constant: the calling of the ocean. In, at or near the sea I’m the best version of myself. I freedive into the deep, hitchsail across oceans, and play around with my kite and board. Im an ambassadors for adventure and advocate for sustainability. All my endeavors are around making people happy, inspiring to make dreams happen, exploring the outdoors, creating awareness about global issues, and act accordingly to make a positive impact. The ocean gives me my play, my life.</p>

<p>I had to experience an ocean crossing and now I have, twice. The adventurous way. I found a boat to cross the Atlantic. I left a boat (just in time!). I found another boat. I made it to the Caribbean. And I made it back to Europe. What an adventure it has been! 350 + 850 2262 + 2100 + 1150 miles. High seas, low seas, good times, bad times. I learned loads about sailing, seamanship, people, how (and how not) to hitchsail, and most importantly the ocean. This adventure, its impact and the impact I hope it going to have, is not to be summarized in a sentence. I like to help others to experience this. That’s why I’m dedicated tons of time to compile my tips, my story and the stories of +70 interviewed captains and hitch sailors into a book.</p>
<p>I feel more responsible and motivated than ever to bring life back into the ocean. Because the ocean are dying. The time to do something is NOW! With this book, as well as with other oceanpreneurial projects I aim to encourage, inspire, and inform to broadens horizons and trigger for positive change. Cause we all need to team up to keep the our playground, our life, our ocean, alive! Since this year I'll go through life as the Oceanpreneur. You can learn more about what I do on my website <a href=""http://www.theoceanpreneur.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>www.theoceanpreneur.com</span></a>.

<p>Your contribution helps me to (self) publish this e-book in a timely manner and give this project the care to make it good. While the costs of electronic publishing are low, the challenges of writing and publishing a qualitative, useful, fun e-book are many. With your support I will be able to speed up the process. I need to dedicate my time on optimizing the content and outsource tasks that are not my piece of cake. </p>
<p>Contributions will be used for editing, proofreading, graphic design, formatting, website, launch and marketing, software like Scrivener, a share for a new typing machine so I can process the video footage, for the rewards which include cool ocean experiences and offsetting CO2 through coral adoption, and for the indiegogo transactions fees.</p>
<p>Whatever the amount raised, I will make it the best book it can be. I want it to be a unique, helpful and visual guide for future hitchsailors, those with an itch for adventure, a drive to make a difference, and those simply interested to read about the adventure. </p>
<p>This campaign is about building support and buzz for my book and the ocean. The book is just the beginning. As the oceanpreneur, I continue to save the ocean, one splash at the time. First goal is to finish the e-book. Anything raised over the goal will allow for a (sustainably) printed version, contribution to a computer with which I can edit all the amazing footage I shot, and for more oceanpreneurial endeavours with the mission to save the ocean.</p>
<h2>How can you contribute?</h2>
<p>I understand that hitchsailing across an ocean is not for everyone. Whether it is for you or not, your contribution is very much welcome and one way or another I can show you the beauty of our ocean through some carefully explored rewards.</p>
<p>There are 3 ways you can support:</p>
<p><b>1. Contribute financially and receive the coolest rewards!</b></p>
<p>No matter the amount. Every action helps! For different numbers I created some cool rewards (Click ON the reward option for ordering):</p>
<p>1. The e-book of course! You can be the first to receive it or to give it away as a present.</p>
<p>2. The e-book as a give-away, which I send on behalf of you with a personal message from me.</p>
<p>3. An AIDA 1 * freedive course and certification, given by certified mermaid instructor Suz</p>
<p>4. A 1-hour skypecall to ask me anything about hitchsailing. You don't have to wait for the book to be finished to get on that boat! safe and prepaired.</p>
<p>5. Receive the <a href=""http://Watertogo.nl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Water-to-go</a> refillable filtered water bottle + filter. You will never need to buy water again. You can take water from the dirtiest river and drink it safely through the filter. Perfect for on a boat. You can just drink water from the tank. With this you can be a great example to the people around you.</p>
<p>6. I will name a fish after you. When I’m in the funderwaterzone I will pick a beauty of a fish, name it after you and send you a picture + info why this fish is important so important for the ocean, for us.</p>
<p>7. Receive the 25l. <a href=""http://bit.ly/aquapac-backpack"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Aquapac</a> waterproof backpack that I haven't gone a day without in the last year. Whether you go (hitch)sailing, kayaking, kitesurfing or on another splashtastic adventure, your clothes will stay dry. I team up with these guys. You won't find a bag of this quality anywhere cheaper.</p>
<p>8. A ocean friendly diner to talk about the adventure, hitchsailing, and the ocean.  </p>
<p>9. Adopt a coral increasing life in the sea for food, protection, jobs, fun for both fish and humans. This will also help to offset this project. For this I work together with <a href=""http://crfbonaire.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Coral Restoration Foundation </a>Bonaire, where you can visit your coral growing up.</p>
<p>10. We're going hitchsailing together! We'll find boat for minimum 3 days/2nights somewhere in europe, this year. During this trip I will explain you all about hitchsailing, a life of adventure travel, life in the ocean and ocean conservation. We won't only be talking, we'll be doing good and have a hell of a good time too! A risky perk? Trust in me ;) I've been there before... *doesn't include transport and food expenses, or maybe it does! Depends on what we find...</p>

<p><i>“I get up every morning determined to both change the world and have one hell of a good time. Sometimes this makes planning my day difficult. - E.B. White</i></p>
<p>I work on my book every day. But not the whole day. I also have to spend time with the ocean, freediving, hitchsailing, to keep myself energized to tackle the challenges, to get reminded of what I’m doing it all for, and to keep learning. Further I’m working on launching oceanpreneurial sailing expeditions to get more people involved in the ocean splashes! My goal is to have the book finished in summer 2016. It’s a doable challenge. With your support and my willpower and determination I don’t foresee any major problems.</p>

If you think it's too expensive, too difficult, or too much to learn, you're wrong! Read on and before you know it you'll leave the safe harbour...  IntroMy name is Suzanne van der Veeken. I pursue ocean adventures with the mission to save the ocean. Last year I aimed for a big sailing exploration. But how to do that with no boat, no budget nor sailing experience?As Walt Disney says: “If it can be dreamt, it can be done.’ So I dreamt, and so I did. The Hitchsailing across the Atlantic Ocean e-book will help you, your adventurous friend, cousin, mum, or kid go on the adventure of a lifetime. As a supporter of this crowd funding campaign you’ll contribute to get this book out to dream chasers, adventure seekers and ocean savers. The book inspires for adventure, helps making dreams come true, increases awareness about ocean conservation, and hopefully creates some new ocean ambassadors.  Photo: captain Rudy, who made it happen!   Why (hitch)sail across an ocean?
 
Sailing is such a fascinating means of transport and it’s so much more than that. It a way of living, a way of independence, a way of going to places where no one comes, a way of really going 100 % into nature. When does that still happen? So why cross an ocean then, you may wonder? An ocean passage is really a radical removal from it all, long enough to really disconnect from everything but nature. There is no wifi. No stress. No media. No system to comply with. No deadlines. No pressure. There is no way back! It’s back to basics. It’s hours of stargazing, it’s meeting dozens of dolphins and whales, it’s seeing the most pure sunsets and sunrises, it’s breathing the fresh ocean air. Day in day out. You become energized, oxygenated and fully alive. It’s loads of thinking about life and your purpose in it. When you crossed the big pond you'll feel accomplished and ready to take over the world! Last but not least, it’s the most sustainable way to travel. So why the Atlantic Ocean? To feel like Columbus! You don't have to imagine what I feels like to suddenly see land after days and days of ocean, you can experience it. When it turns winter in Europe the tradewinds pick up just in time to make your way sailing to the Caribbean. Every day it's gets a little warmer. Then arriving in the tropics with coconuts, rumpunch and steeldrum music at every beach corner is another dream becoming reality. When the hurricane season approaches boats make their way eastwards, to be just in time for European spring. Crossing the Atlantic Ocean is a expedition, though not the most challenging oceanpassage out there. It's a great starting point and will trigger you for more.  
“Because in the end, you won’t remember the time you spent working in the office or mowing your lawn. Climb that goddamn mountain.”― Jack Kerouac Or sail that wide ocean!
No boat? Nooo worries! That’s when this book comes in handy.

Who is this book for?
For the dreamers, the adventurous, and the curious.

For those who like to get inspired for adventure
For those who like to learn more about hitchsailing and how it works
For those who are thinking about crossing an ocean and like to get started
For those who like to go to the other side of the Atlantic pond in most sustainable way
For crew looking for boats, but also for captains looking for crew.
For those with no boat, no budget, no sailing experience but a drive for adventure
For those with a boat and willingness to make a meaningful mission out of their ocean voyage
For those who love the ocean and want to learn more about what’s happening
And for those who simply like to read what an adventure like this is like

 
 Boat 1: Where I learned how NOT to sail across an ocean
 
What will the book cover?
The book answers questions like: How and why to go on this adventure? What is it like? When and where to find a boat? When to leave a boat? How to prepare? Why you should or should not do this? When to be where? How to profile yourself? How to prepare? How to make it safe? How to tell mum that it is a safe and sensible thing to do? How can you make it a meaningful journey? How does it work on the other side? And much more!
The book is based on my experience plus the experience of +70 captains and hitchsailors. I’ve done a big survey amongst other hitchsailors and captains who crossed (or attempted) and asked them about their experience and lessons learned. 
The book includes tips, guidelines, my story, interviewees stories. In writing, graphics and photos.

The Impact
The hitchsailing book is part of a bigger mission: to save the ocean.
By creating this e-book I hope to encourage, inspire, and inform for adventure and ocean exploration. For one to experience the magic and the situation of the ocean, to experience the beauty of simple resourceful living, and then, act accordingly. 
It’s since this big sailing adventure that I have really realized how bad the situation of our ocean is, and how dependent we are on it. I feel more responsible and motivated than ever to bring life back into the ocean.
My ocean explorations have shown me the tsunami of challenges our oceans are facing. In the middle of the Atlantic I fished water samples that appeared to be clear but had 47 tiny pieces of plastic. I’ve been zigzag sailing to avoid the hundreds of trawling fishing boats. I’ve stared at parades of plastic floating. I built sandcastles of plastic sand. I’ve been dancing with manta-rays in a plastic soup. I’ve been freediving looking for fish and couldn’t find any, on places where they’re supposed to be in abundance. The ocean gets emptied, trashed, polluted and out of balance because of our busy and demanding lifes on land. I have experienced these sad situations. And by going out on a boat for a while I have also experienced how very little we actually need. But we do need the ocean to live.
I love the ocean so I protect that. But It’s not about me. It’s about everyone, everyone’s kids and every life on the planet. We are alive right now because of the oceans. Now the ocean needs to be kept alive by us.
People protect what they love. So I want people to fall in love with the ocean. To fall in love with the ocean and get most triggered to make a difference, I believe you have to experience the ocean. 
 
Photo: Taking watersamples to contribute and learn about plastic pollution. Results are shocking!So who's this girl?
Me in 5 words: oceanpreneur, explorer, mermaid, environmentalist, incentivizer.
During my 10 years of adventuring around the world there has been one constant: the calling of the ocean. In, at or near the sea I’m the best version of myself. I freedive into the deep, hitchsail across oceans, and play around with my kite and board. Im an ambassadors for adventure and advocate for sustainability. All my endeavors are around making people happy, inspiring to make dreams happen, exploring the outdoors, creating awareness about global issues, and act accordingly to make a positive impact. The ocean gives me my play, my life.
 

I had to experience an ocean crossing and now I have, twice. The adventurous way. I found a boat to cross the Atlantic. I left a boat (just in time!). I found another boat. I made it to the Caribbean. And I made it back to Europe. What an adventure it has been! 350 + 850 2262 + 2100 + 1150 miles. High seas, low seas, good times, bad times. I learned loads about sailing, seamanship, people, how (and how not) to hitchsail, and most importantly the ocean. This adventure, its impact and the impact I hope it going to have, is not to be summarized in a sentence. I like to help others to experience this. That’s why I’m dedicated tons of time to compile my tips, my story and the stories of +70 interviewed captains and hitch sailors into a book.
I feel more responsible and motivated than ever to bring life back into the ocean. Because the ocean are dying. The time to do something is NOW! With this book, as well as with other oceanpreneurial projects I aim to encourage, inspire, and inform to broadens horizons and trigger for positive change. Cause we all need to team up to keep the our playground, our life, our ocean, alive! Since this year I'll go through life as the Oceanpreneur. You can learn more about what I do on my website www.theoceanpreneur.com. Find me on the social media as @oceanpreneur. On Instagram I do live video updates. Once the book is finished I'll go into video and share some hitch-sailing episodes on Youtube.
 
What has been done?

The experience: the search for a ride, being on the WRONG boat, crossing from East to West on a lovely little sailingboat, crossing from West to East on a bigger delivery boat. 3 totally different experiences with loads of ups, downs and lessons learned.
75% of the first draft is finished
40 hitch sailors and 30 captains have been interviewed to bring in more perspectives about the Atlantic Ocean hitchsailing situation
Interview results have been analysed
80% of photo’s have been selected and edited
Video footage has been shot


What is left to be done?

Finish the final 25% of first draft
Have it proofread, edited, and finalize content
Have it formatted
Have content photos graphics compiled
Edit the video and if I manage incorporate that in the e-book
Design of the cover
Marketing
Launch it!
Save the ocean

When the crowd funding succeeds I expect to deliver:
First draft: May 15
Final draft: June 15
Final version: July 15
Launch: August 2016
Update: This was NOT realistic. ETA Spring 2017!
 
Photo: the course to paradiseYour Contribution
Your contribution helps me to (self) publish this e-book in a timely manner and give this project the care to make it good. While the costs of electronic publishing are low, the challenges of writing and publishing a qualitative, useful, fun e-book are many. With your support I will be able to speed up the process. I need to dedicate my time on optimizing the content and outsource tasks that are not my piece of cake. 
Contributions will be used for editing, proofreading, graphic design, formatting, website, launch and marketing, software like Scrivener, a share for a new typing machine so I can process the video footage, for the rewards which include cool ocean experiences and offsetting CO2 through coral adoption, and for the indiegogo transactions fees.
Whatever the amount raised, I will make it the best book it can be. I want it to be a unique, helpful and visual guide for future hitchsailors, those with an itch for adventure, a drive to make a difference, and those simply interested to read about the adventure. 
This campaign is about building support and buzz for my book and the ocean. The book is just the beginning. As the oceanpreneur, I continue to save the ocean, one splash at the time. First goal is to finish the e-book. Anything raised over the goal will allow for a (sustainably) printed version, contribution to a computer with which I can edit all the amazing footage I shot, and for more oceanpreneurial endeavours with the mission to save the ocean.
How can you contribute?
I understand that hitchsailing across an ocean is not for everyone. Whether it is for you or not, your contribution is very much welcome and one way or another I can show you the beauty of our ocean through some carefully explored rewards.
There are 3 ways you can support:
1. Contribute financially and receive the coolest rewards!
No matter the amount. Every action helps! For different numbers I created some cool rewards (Click ON the reward option for ordering):
1. The e-book of course! You can be the first to receive it or to give it away as a present.
2. The e-book as a give-away, which I send on behalf of you with a personal message from me.
3. An AIDA 1 * freedive course and certification, given by certified mermaid instructor Suz
4. A 1-hour skypecall to ask me anything about hitchsailing. You don't have to wait for the book to be finished to get on that boat! safe and prepaired.
5. Receive the Water-to-go refillable filtered water bottle + filter. You will never need to buy water again. You can take water from the dirtiest river and drink it safely through the filter. Perfect for on a boat. You can just drink water from the tank. With this you can be a great example to the people around you.
6. I will name a fish after you. When I’m in the funderwaterzone I will pick a beauty of a fish, name it after you and send you a picture + info why this fish is important so important for the ocean, for us.
7. Receive the 25l. Aquapac waterproof backpack that I haven't gone a day without in the last year. Whether you go (hitch)sailing, kayaking, kitesurfing or on another splashtastic adventure, your clothes will stay dry. I team up with these guys. You won't find a bag of this quality anywhere cheaper.
8. A ocean friendly diner to talk about the adventure, hitchsailing, and the ocean.  
9. Adopt a coral increasing life in the sea for food, protection, jobs, fun for both fish and humans. This will also help to offset this project. For this I work together with Coral Restoration Foundation Bonaire, where you can visit your coral growing up.
10. We're going hitchsailing together! We'll find boat for minimum 3 days/2nights somewhere in europe, this year. During this trip I will explain you all about hitchsailing, a life of adventure travel, life in the ocean and ocean conservation. We won't only be talking, we'll be doing good and have a hell of a good time too! A risky perk? Trust in me ;) I've been there before... *doesn't include transport and food expenses, or maybe it does! Depends on what we find...
Contributions are stated in US$ as only this currency allows for multiple payment options like paypal, creditcard, apple payment and banktransfer. Payments can be made with any currency or bank account. Processing costs will be deducted from the raised amount. No extra costs for you. If payment method doesn't matter for you, pick Paypal, which has the least amount of transaction costs.

<h3>The Short Version</h3>
<p>I an independent author, sometime blogger, historian, and currently a soldier in the Israel Defense Force. I have also been a huge fan of science fiction, specifically space opera, all my life, and the Galaxy Ascendant is the product of my love of the genre, and a desire to uplift a genre that for a long time has been somewhat stagnant—and more recently, as an alternative to the inferior products put out by the major franchises that inspired me, or at least by those that aren’t just completely dead.</p>
<p>Through this campaign, I am seeking to raise the money to cover the costs of getting this book out and into the hands of readers like you. The book is already completed, and is currently going through the editorial process, while the cover art is also in progress, along with an updated galaxy map. Being able to raise these funds will grant me the ability to continue to put out quality work without the immense pressure that is the cost required to get it out (army salaries are nothing to write home about), and will allow me to move forward with the series and other projects at a much faster pace. In fact, the outlines for the next two books in the series are already complete, and I intend to start writing imminently.</p>
<p>This might also be a unique crowdfund, in that I am funding book 3 in the series. My primary reason for this was thus: I wanted to get out quality work completely on my own at first, in order to demonstrate without a shadow of a doubt that I can and will get the project done, and make it awesome.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need to cover the costs of the editing, the cover art, a new galaxy map (as the area of the galaxy the story takes place in has significantly increased for this book), as well as the formatting. With your help, I will be able to get everything ready quickly, and the book (whether ebook or print) out to you as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I have a few stretch goals already in place, and a couple others in mind, and which I may present to backers as options down the line, if it looks like we’ll get there. I’d love to get audio versions of the series made, as well as hardcover, perhaps a comic adaptation, and who knows? If we go crazy high, I could even see about other, more extravagant things, in addition to potentially covering production costs of future books in the Galaxy Ascendant series. The stars are the limit!</p>
<p>And, as this is the third book in the series I am seeking to fund here, those of you new to the Galaxy Ascendant can jump in now and get nearly half the series all in one go, giving you much more to read as I work on books 4 and 5, the outlines of which are both already complete. And, as of right now, book 4 is well under way!</p>
<p>If there are any perks you would like so see that aren't already listed here, don't hesitate to run them by me, and I'll see what I can do!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Help bring space opera back to its former prominence!</p>
<p>The Galaxy Ascendant series is one of the most ambitious fiction projects ever undertaken by a single writer. Throughout the three books so far, there are more than a dozen unique aliens species, nearly 150 named characters, and grand, interwoven plotlines that set the stage not only for the rest of this seven book series, but for many, many more stories to come. I am not just writing a book series here. I am creating a living, breathing galaxy whose presence will only continue to expand.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Galaxy Ascendant recaptures a sense of heroism that is lost in much of modern fiction. Virtuous heroes and heroines who strive to do the right thing, despite the challenges before them.</p>
<p>Play a role in bringing back fun, creativity, and heroism back to a genre that can and should personify all of those things!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>None! As I mentioned above, the book is already written, and the editing, cover art, and galaxy map are all in progress. The book will come out no matter the outcome of this campaign, but its success will greatly increase my ability to move the series along.</p>
<p>As you can also see above, I have already released the first two books in the series, both of which have been well received, and you can be sure that I will keep the level of quality the same. The cover art is once again being done by the incredible John Zeleznik, and the editing by the excellent Ben Zwycky. Additionally, a new, updated galaxy map is in progress, being done by Cornelia Yoder, who made the awesome map in my recently released fantasy novel, <i>The Dragon Hand</i>.</p>

</div></div>","In the Shadow of Prometheus is a science fantasy adventure novel set in the backdrop of the early 24th century. Enter a world of Vanguards and Insurgents in this expansive setting with gamified elements.
 

 

 
It is the year 2319. A new age has dawned and a governmental body known as ""The Ethocratic Republic"" has brought freedom and liberty to all across the globe.
 

 
Helping to maintain the peace in this utopic future are the Vanguard, elected officials with augmented strength, endurance and sharp natural intellect. 
 

 
Humanity has flourished and the Vanguard stand strong as a symbol of the unity and strength at the heart of civilisation.
 

 
But even paradise has its share of shadows. After decades of peace, conflict is brewing - old injuries are starting to seethe, and vendettas thought long forgotten have once again risen to the surface. 
Now, an insurgency lies in wait, determined to bring the Ethocracy and its Vanguard protectors to their knees. War is brewing, and the Ethocratic Republic must fight to justify its existence against the tide of malice on the horizon. 
 

 
In the Shadow of Prometheus follows Oni Anagonye and Vanguard team K:10 Theta as they attempt to unearth this conspiracy and close the threat of the Machiavellians before they cause irreperable damage to their society.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Nina Raman and I am the author of Everything You Wanted. I wrote this book because I wanted to share a story about growing up with a battle of perfection, but with a dark twist.<br/><br/>My hope is that in reading this book, you will discover that your desires are not wrong. They might turn out to be everything you wanted, or they might turn your life completely upside down. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to discover yourself and learn how your decisions have a massive effect on your life. I want this book to be a way for you to escape a world of your own and live through a group of teens who enter a whole new world of fear, mystery, and the unknown. </p>
<p>Wren Clements has spent her whole life trying to be perfect. As her high school career is about to come to an end, she realizes that what she wants more than her amazing grades, her numerous extracurriculars, and even more than her spot at UPenn, is to live like a normal teenager for one crazy, lawless night. She embarks on an evening filled with things she would never do... including a murder? Could this star student be the perfect suspect, or could this be the perfect crime?</p>
<p>You will love this book if you love relatable and diverse characters, juicy love stories, and a perfectly gruesome crime. Everything You Wanted speaks to teenagers and adults who want to grapple with perfection and desire vs. regret in a new way.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I hope that Everything You Wanted inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have any regrets in life?</li>
<li>Are you willing to risk everything to fulfill a desire?</li>
<li>Are you happy with yourself, or want something someone else has?</li>
</ul>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing what truly matters to you, the battle of perfection, and personal growth will change us all for the better. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>

<li>The cover design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)</li>
<li>The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).</li>
<li>The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</li>
<li>The launch &amp; promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this spring.</li>
</ul>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover and an audiobook.<br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:<ul>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Nina Raman is a junior Management Information Systems major at Temple University in Philadelphia, PA. Although her major is technical and she spends most of her time running clubs and meeting new people, she always makes time for her true love: writing. </p>
<p><br/>Her dream since she was in 3rd grade was to always be an author. She’s been obsessed with storytelling for as long as she can remember, so it’s no question why she decided to write a book. Nina’s goal has always been to help people feel something like a connection, even if they don’t have one in real life. Characters are our friends, family, teachers, enemies, and lovers. She hopes that you will feel connected to a character or two, learn from their mistakes, and even make a few of your own. She wants you to not just read her story, but live in it.<br/><br/>When Nina doesn’t have her nose in a book or is vigorously typing out the lines of her novel on her laptop, she loves meeting new people, exploring new places, trying new food, and hanging out with friends. And if she’s ever late (which she almost always is,) she most likely stopped to pet a dog. <br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Nina Raman at ninaraman00@gmail.com and at Instagram: @ninaramanwrites TikTok: @nina_raman Twitter: @nina_noodles1 LinkedIn: Nina Raman .</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier. <br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>Face Flat explores the concept of what it means to follow your own path and what failure can teach you. It's a series of short stories with lessons learned in politics and a restaurant - two very unique and different industries that can teach you a lot about yourself and others.  </i></p>
<p>My name is Vanessa Millones and I am the author of <i>Face Flat</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to share my unique journey of working for the Obama White House and then as a server at a restaurant. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover through failure you can find that lessons exist in all corners. And through these lessons, you will realize that you never fell off the ""path"" you planned - you were on it all along. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to learn what it was like working at the Obama White House, and, at the same time, the insights from working in the restaurant industry. Lessons are everywhere, especially after falling face flat - you just have to look a little harder.</p>

<p>Is your path supposed to look a certain way and if so, what happens if you go off course?

Face Flat explores the concept of what it means to follow your own path and what failure can teach you. It's a series of short stories with lessons learned in politics and a restaurant - two very unique and different industries that can teach you a lot about yourself and others.  
My name is Vanessa Millones and I am the author of Face Flat. I wrote this book because I wanted to share my unique journey of working for the Obama White House and then as a server at a restaurant. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover through failure you can find that lessons exist in all corners. And through these lessons, you will realize that you never fell off the ""path"" you planned - you were on it all along. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to learn what it was like working at the Obama White House, and, at the same time, the insights from working in the restaurant industry. Lessons are everywhere, especially after falling face flat - you just have to look a little harder.
You will love this book if you are a young ambitious individual who loves structure and cringes at the idea of uncertainty.Face Flat speaks to young ambitious people or those who want to pivot and who want to look at failure differently while discovering their own journey.Ultimately, I hope that it inspires reflection and meaningful dialogue, pressing into questions like:
Is your path supposed to look a certain way and if so, what happens if you go off course? Or, do we really need to have it all perfectly planned out in order to fit the stereotypical idea of what it means to lead a successful life? And if we don’t follow this plan, does that mean we steered away from our journey?
I'm excited to explore these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing politics, the validity and importance of working in the restaurant industry, and learning what it means to follow your own plan.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>Reclaiming Control is a non-fiction, personal development book about learning how to take control of the things we can, and how to let go of what we can't. Instead of getting distracted by the noise around us, Reclaiming Control encourages you to look inward to live with intention and meaning.<br/><br/>My name is Amy McMillen, and I am the author of Reclaiming Control. I decided to write this book because last year, I finally took ownership of my own life. For a long time, I had this unnerving voice inside my head that I wasn't living life on my terms. I felt pulled in all sorts of directions by everything around me — the prescribed path of ""success"", the desire to do something impactful, my parents, my friends, my email inbox, my health, the hustle and bustle of New York City...<br/><br/>I didn't know it at the time, but I was experiencing burnout; not simply by my job, but by life. Studies have shown that burnout isn't necessarily being busy or working too hard, but rather the lack of control that individuals feel over their situations.<br/><br/>In this book, I'll take you on a journey of how I came to realize that the power to reclaim control was within me all along. I also introduce you to others who are on their own journeys and helping others as well, including entrepreneurs, psychologists, and coaches. You'll learn how people are redefining and creating their own meaning of success day by day, and how to lay the foundation of moments filled with mindful love, compassion, and kindness towards yourself and others.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about burnout, mindfulness, and emotional intelligence through three parts:<ul>
<li>How we lost control and how burnout, loneliness, depression, and anxiety became epidemics</li>
<li>How we can learn skills of looking inward to discern what to control and what to let go</li>
<li>How it isn't just self-help— it's about having the capacity to care for others, work, and the environment as well</li>
</ul> If you've been following a certain narrative of your life without truly questioning it, or telling yourself that people like you don't get to dream or be creative, then this book is for you. If you've been working towards the American dream, only to find out that perhaps that wasn't your own dream at all, then this book is for you. If you've ever felt stuck, lost, lonely, or confused in who you are or what you're doing, then this book is also for you. If you've ever told yourself that ""one day"" you'll get it together, then this book is for you.<br/> <h3>The Book - Reclaiming Control</h3>
<br/>The book is written in three parts:<br/><br/><strong>Part 1: How We Lost Control.</strong> The first section focuses on the stories you've been told growing up, the prescribed path of traditional success, and the role of technology and education in the mental health crisis. You'll also learn why now is a pivotal time for these issues, especially for those who come from low-income, immigrant, and/or multicultural families.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2: Skills to Reclaim.</strong> These chapters include foundations of mindfulness and emotional intelligence to observe, accept, and manage thoughts and feelings. You'll also learn what design thinking and the scientific method can teach about designing life experiments to reframe failure. Part two offers tangible examples for you to discern what to reclaim and what to let go, moment by moment.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3: Beyond Yourself.</strong> The last section focuses on how reclaiming control over your own life helps your friendships, families, communities, organizations, and the Earth be more sustainable as well. You'll learn how innovation can stem from emotions and adversity, and only when you recalibrate your thoughts, feelings, and actions to align with your values can you provide the most impact.<h3> </h3>

<h3>The Story of My Book</h3>
<p>My name is Colette Tracy and I am the author of the book <i>Both Sides Now: Reflections for<br/>Women at Midlife.</i> I wrote this book because I have not seen many positive books on aging, and particularly for and about women.</p>
<p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will recognize yourself in these pages and take inspiration from the community of women that share the unique experience of this time in life. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for living life at this time. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool, and also as a close friend sharing the same struggles, tears, triumphs and joys that is life.</p>
<p>In this book you will recognize that regardless of life's challenges; our faith, strength, resilience, and self care can bring us back to a healthy place in life.</p>
<p>You'll hear stories about women who journeyed through devastating depression to come out on the other side to live a life of love, peace, and fulfillment. You'll hear stories about women who lived through abusive relationships and extreme physical illness that healed through faith, self love, and self care. You'll hear stories about women that used their difficult times in life to make them strong and to ultimately become a beacon of light and guidance for thousands of other women.</p>
<p>You will love this book if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are looking for connection and inspiration to live your best life at this time and all your times to come.</li>
<li>You are looking for a guide to give you inspiration and encouragement to move forward and live your life on your terms.</li>
<li>You are interested in the way women are cultured to care and nurture others and how these beautiful qualities we possess can help us to better care for and love ourselves as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Both Sides Now</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to middle aged women and all people who want to look at life from a more empowered perspective.</p>

My name is Colette Tracy and I am the author of the book Both Sides Now: Reflections forWomen at Midlife. I wrote this book because I have not seen many positive books on aging, and particularly for and about women.
My hope is that, in reading this book, you will recognize yourself in these pages and take inspiration from the community of women that share the unique experience of this time in life. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for living life at this time. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool, and also as a close friend sharing the same struggles, tears, triumphs and joys that is life.
In this book you will recognize that regardless of life's challenges; our faith, strength, resilience, and self care can bring us back to a healthy place in life.
You'll hear stories about women who journeyed through devastating depression to come out on the other side to live a life of love, peace, and fulfillment. You'll hear stories about women who lived through abusive relationships and extreme physical illness that healed through faith, self love, and self care. You'll hear stories about women that used their difficult times in life to make them strong and to ultimately become a beacon of light and guidance for thousands of other women.
You will love this book if:

You are looking for connection and inspiration to live your best life at this time and all your times to come.
You are looking for a guide to give you inspiration and encouragement to move forward and live your life on your terms.
You are interested in the way women are cultured to care and nurture others and how these beautiful qualities we possess can help us to better care for and love ourselves as well.

Both Sides Now is a nonfiction book that speaks to middle aged women and all people who want to look at life from a more empowered perspective.
 
What I Need & What You'll Get

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier. The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.
Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:

Please share my pre-sale campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network. Please use #BothSidesNow and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press, so that we can help amplify your efforts.
You can easily share my pre-sale campaign via Indiegogo at the top of the page.
Please share my book with 5 friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoyit via text or direct message on social media.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>Hello! My name is Carl Ottersen.  I am a travel writer and photographer, having written a guide book for Athens last year, published many travel articles from around the world and contribute articles for the online magazine Reveal Italy.  I am also a director No Trees Publishing Ltd of England, an eBook publishing start-up.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>About the Project</strong></h3>
<p>This book, the Great Guide to Liguria, will be published as a digital book (an ebook). Its purpose is to present the beauty of this region in Italy in a new, refreshing style, using the flexibility and functions of eBook technology today to bring the book to life.</p>
<p> Liguria and the Italian Riviera is the region of Italy that curves around from Tuscany and running into France. It has a spectacular coastline, with places like Portofino and the Cinque Terre famous the world over. The Riviera is also very well known for its broad golden sand beaches and clear water, ideal for family vacations. Places like Sanremo and Alassio were the places to go in the 1950s and 1960s. There are also some fascinating tracks inland, up to the peaks and passes over the mountains into Piedmont and Lombardy.  Dotted like jewels in this beautiful tapestry are a myriad of small towns and villages, their houses painted in classic Mediterranean colors, set among silvery olive groves. This eBook takes you to see the best of them.</p>
<p><span>The Great Guide to Liguria has five sections: what to see, what to do, where to stay, what to buy and, as a special extra, recipes from the region.  I am profiling a limited selection of each, so that the reader is entertained by the book itself and enticed to visit the region.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h3><strong>The Campaign</strong></h3>
<p><span>As you can imagine, I have to visit each place personally.  Partly because I need to take good photographs and video, partly because I have to decide what should be in, and what should be out.  There are hundreds of places; I have already made a shortlist and have visited some locations. The structure of the book is in place and I’m writing content every day. </span></p>
<p><span>However there are still many places to visit.  Since I’m in Liguria, this is quite easy, but I need to cover travel expenses, the occasional overnight stay, some equipment costs and a proportion of my time.</span></p>
<p><span>Funding will let me focus 100% on the book, so I can publish and launch it for the summer season.</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>What I need</strong></h3>
<p>I have costed my funding requirement at £4,000.  This breaks down as follows:</p>
<p>Fuel and Highway tolls - 550</p>
<p>Overnight stays - 250</p>
<p>Supplies - 300</p>
<p>Software - 250</p>
<p>Time - 2,370</p>
<p>IndieGogo Fees - 280</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What I offer</h3>
<p><span>I want everyone who funds me to get back more than they contribute.  As you can see in the Perks section, there are five contribution bands: £5, £15, £25, £50 and £100.</span></p>
<p><span>For the £5 contribution I will send you a full size digital poster of Liguria (you can select from a gallery of twelve) that is worth £10.  Yes, you have to print it, but I’m doing it this way to get it to you straight away.</span></p>
<p><span>For the £15 contribution, I will send you a copy of the book when complete, which will be sold at £4.99.  Inside the book is a voucher worth €20 (approximately £18) which can be redeemed when you stay in a hotel listed in the book.  So for a £15 contribution, you earn £23.</span></p>
<p><span>For the £25 contribution, on top of what a £15 contribution gets you, I will send you a full size digital poster of Liguria (you can select from a gallery of twelve) that is worth £10.  Yes, you have to print it, but I’m doing it this way to save shipping costs.  So for a £25 contribution, you earn £33.</span></p>
<p><span>For the £50 contribution, on top of what a £25 contribution gets you, I will send you a local product (you can select from a list of six) that is worth £25, including shipping costs if in Europe.  So for a £50 contribution, you earn £58.</span></p>
<p><span>For the £100 contribution, on top of what a £50 contribution gets you, you will have a free night’s stay in a double room (subject to availability) at any of the participating hotels, worth no less than £75.  So for a £100 contribution, you earn £133.</span></p>
<p><span>For everyone who contributes, I will keep them updated weekly on progress, with clips, fotos and information posted in IndieGoGo, on YouTube and on the Facebook page.</span></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What happens if I don't reach my Goal?</h3>
<p>The priority is first to cover off the fuel costs, then the overnight stays. After that its the equipment (what I have is workable, I would be more productive with better) and finally, of course, is the contribution to my time and effort. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why is it good to do this?</h3>
<p>I hope that from your point of view, as a contributor you can see that in quantifiable terms I am giving back more than I receive.</p>
<p><span>For the reader of the book, I’m sure that the way I present some really lovely places in Liguria will inspire them to visit, explore and enjoy, confident that what would be a good vacation is made something memorable.</span></p>
<p><span>For the region of Liguria, and specifically the hoteliers and local producers, I hope this helps them leverage the beauty of the region to revitalize tourism; it’s deserved but hasn’t been presented to the world as it could be.</span></p>
<p><span>Just so its clear, my interest is in making and publishing the book: I’m not a tour operator and my business is not in promoting hotels.  They are in because they are good (and I know, in a previous career I was a director of a hotel group), and because they will give a discount to the reader who stays there, not a booking fee to me.</span></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Does the Concept work?</h3>
<p>Yes, definitely.  Together with my friends in Greece, late last year we published “Reveal Athens”, which hit front page listings as the first true eBook to promote Athens and has definitely encouraged people to visit the city.  I did the main photography, book layout, contributed to and edited the location articles. You can find it on the iTunes bookstore - just type in ""Reveal Athens"".</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Should this Project work?</h3>
<p>Passion for writing about interesting places aside, yes, it should.  The region is well known of course, and can always be presented better with today’s technology, something which hasn’t been done yet.  I have the experience not only of travel writing in general, but also seeing the successful launch of the eBook on Athens.</p>
<p><span>The digital book will be published by No Trees Publishing Ltd of England (I am a director of this company) on Apple’s iTunes bookstore as an iBook, directly in ePub3 format and in ePub/Mobi format on Amazon (this, unfortunately, without the interactivity of the other two, but still valid).  That triples the market presence compared to Reveal Athens, which is only available in iBook format.</span></p>
<p><span>On top of that, I am introducing the idea of a <strong>redeemable voucher worth €20</strong> (£18) for each an every book sold which is worth more than the book price itself.  This wasn’t in the Reveal Athens book, so it’s an innovation.  It certainly should be a powerful hook which I hope will be a very effective marketing tool for the promotion and selling of the book itself.  </span></p>
<p><span>To give you an idea of how confident I am, once this project is done I will start another for the county of Kent in England (known as the “Garden of England”) and later this year for the islands of Java and Flores (that’s two books) in Indonesia.</span></p>

<h3><span>If you can't contribute but would like to help</span></h3>

As an author you want to give your ideas to the world in a way that has impact - not just revenues. <b>Happy Melly Express helps you create innovative, high-quality content that delivers your solutions in a format that has impact.</b> So that your readers can improve their work and their lives.

<h3>Here's why you should <a href=""http://bit.ly/17Ydj4xhcta"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">support our project</a>
</h3> Happy Melly Express is a different kind of publishing business. One that helps you, the author find and <b>reach your audience faster than can be done through traditional publishing</b>. Unlike self-publishing, Happy Melly Express is a publishing business that helps you deliver high quality content. <b>We help you create books and multimedia content that is tailored for your audience. </b>Content that educates and supports your audience with tutorials, interviews and additional material.<br/><br/>Happy Melly Express helps you, the reader, find high quality content that describes solutions to the problems you face at work. <b>Not just books, but also multimedia content that helps you better explain these new ideas to your colleagues and bosses. </b><br/><br/><p>This
 campaign funds the first publishing project, which in turn 
will - when successful - fund future publishing projects. <b>For every 
successful publishing project Happy Melly Express wants to fund two other publishing 
projects.</b> <br/></p>
<p>The first project helps you create the change you seek at work. Read on for more.<br/></p>
<h3>The First Project: Lean Change Management - A Feedback-Driven Approach to Change</h3>
<p>
Organizational changes are designed and planned with the best of intentions. Yet, according to various studies, these change initiatives fail 70% of the time. Often, planning isn't the problem. No matter how thorough you are, it is impossible to predict how the people affected by the change will ultimately react.<br/></p>
<p>
<b>Lean Change Management is a book designed to help you understand how to approach and execute changes within your organization based on feedback-driven methods. </b>It adapts to people's reactions to the changes, rather than trying to predict them all.  Lean Change combines ideas from Lean Startup, neuroscience and the Agile and Lean worlds. It walks you through the process of defining, implementing and discovering the changes you need to help your organization.
</p>
<p>
<b>Lean Change is the first book in the Happy Melly Express publishing project. When funded, it will include: the book, Video tutorials, additional templates, guides to walk you through your first Lean Change.</b> If you select the Sponsor or Godfather backer level, you will also have the opportunity to participate in a Hangout with Jason Little the author of the book. <br/></p>
<p><i><b>And there's more! If you back this campaign NOW (at Early Access-level or higher), you'll receive an early version of the book immediately! </b></i><br/></p>
<h4>Praise for Lean Change, first edition:</h4>
<p><i>“I think this is a key contribution to the Lean/Agile/CM world - one that is perhaps long overdue.”</i> 
- <b>Jamie Longmuir, Agile Coach </b><br/></p>
<p><i>""The model of feedback-driven change is very exciting to me.  I believe 
Lean Change can be applied to a broad range of change situations to 
produce system-owned results.  Jason proposes a broad range of system 
data to generate and evaluate small actions and measurable results, 
executed with a quick turn-around.""</i> - <b>Barbara Heller, Organizational Effectiveness Consultant</b><br/></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><b>We
 all have to work in order to make a living. The difference between happy and unhappy workers is the 
way we work. </b>The way we interact with our colleagues, with our bosses or
 with our team. I
 dream of a world where you can reach out and grab smart methods to work happy. Discover ways of organizing your work so that you can create  a happy environment where you and your peers can do work you are proud of. I’ve seen a future where we can 
think, ‘today is a good day to work!’ A fantasy? I don’t think so.</p>
<p><b>By contributing to this campaign you
 are helping us to get the first projects published</b> as well as setting 
us on a journey to find and publish more work that will make your life 
as a creative worker better.</p>
<p>We are starting with books (digital and
 print), as we believe that is still a very good way to get knowledge 
across. <b>We will also be looking into other types of publishing projects 
such as: blogs, podcasts, video casts, webinars, etc</b>.</p>
<p>If
 you have a great idea for a book, blog, podcast or other method for 
bringing great ideas to creative workers - <a href=""mailto:hmexpress@happymelly.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">get in touch!</a> Maybe we can 
support you too!</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Of
 course, we need money to get started. Our aim is to publish good ideas 
packed in good products (starting with books), so we need professionals 
for that. We calculated we need USD $11.000 and this is how we are going
 to use it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Around $2500 USD for structural and copy editing the first projects
</li>
<li>Around $800 USD for illustrations and website development</li>
<li>Around $2000 USD for book layout and cover design</li>
<li>Around $1000 USD for proofreading and finalizing the first projects</li>
<li>Around
 $1000 USD for work related to managing the project as well as starting a
 beta-readers campaign, so that we publish high-quality and community 
reviewed content.</li>
<li>Around $1100 USD to pay for, and ship the rewards that we are offering in this campaign</li>
<li>Around $1600 USD for fees and costs to set up this campaign (payment fees, design, writing, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If we surpass our funding goal, the rewards for contributors will be bigger. Stay tuned for details.</p>

<p>DITL is an idea—profile the people in our midst—founded on a belief—everyone has a story worth telling. DITL is not (yet) a website, a content delivery system, or a brand with a logo. Your contribution will help me build out web infrastructure that will share the stories, photo essays, and videos. Once the distribution platform is up and running, and if funding allows, I will focus on expanding our story selection.</p>
<p>Especially when big news strikes, DITL should be there. With your support (and that of ride sharers and couch surfers), DITL will tell you the story of the Far Rockaway resident during Hurricane Sandy; of the upstate New York teacher who has worn the same outfit to work each day for two years in solidarity with a student who was bullied; of the Moore, Oklahoma mother in the days after the tornado struck; of the Somalian refugee making a life in Salt Lake City; of the stripper making doctor-money in North Dakota.</p>
<p>Who should we DITL? Contribute today and have a say in which people get profiled.</p>
<h2>Because Strangers Are Not Strange</h2>
<p>This type of content will provide a fresh take on a well-worn idea in American news and entertainment—reality TV. Americans watch an average of 34 hours of TV a week, or nearly five hours a day. Oftentimes, our TVs are tuned to reality TV shows—four of the top 10 shows in the 2012-13 season were of the genre.</p>
<p>DITL will similarly shine a light on everyday folks, both those you see (for example, the emergency room nurse) and those you don’t (for example, the people who fix the sewer system). The percentage of Americans who say that they trust others has fallen from more than half in the early 1960s to fewer than a third today. By providing a peek into the life of people previously regarded as strangers, DITL will help increase understanding and awareness—and we could use a little more of each.</p>
<p>What if these people had engaging content to read and look at, a short profile in words, photos, or video of an everyday American like them, an all-access pass into a day in the life?</p>
<p>Say, reality journalism.</p>
<h2>You + Me = DITL</h2>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Jenna Beaulieu and I am a writer living in northern Maine. I love the land I live in, however, one of the areas where I experience a sense of 'lack' is in the writing community.</p>
<p>I soak up conversations and interactions with writers whenever I chance upon them in the area. And I've done so since I was 13 years old!</p>
<p>At age 13, I met Wesley McNair, a poet who sold me my first signed poetry book (which I still own and cherish) and who is now serving a five-year term as Maine's Poet Laureate.</p>

<p>I need $550 by March 29 to register for the retreat. That amount is the cost for registration, which covers lodging, food, and workshop costs.

<p>Any donations are appreciated and the perks I offer are related to my writing career - both where it's been and where it's going.

</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Although I make my living by writing articles for a local newspaper and I also write for two blogs, poetry is my original form of expression.</p>
<p>Attending the Black Fly Writing Retreat is my way of continuing down this path. However, the great thing about improving writing skills is that they apply across the board.</p>
<p>Perhaps my attendance at the fiction workshop will increase the likelihood that I actually rewrite that novel I wrote a few years ago. Who knows! </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Jenna Beaulieu and I am a writer living in northern Maine. I love the land I live in, however, one of the areas where I experience a sense of 'lack' is in the writing community.
I soak up conversations and interactions with writers whenever I chance upon them in the area. And I've done so since I was 13 years old!
At age 13, I met Wesley McNair, a poet who sold me my first signed poetry book (which I still own and cherish) and who is now serving a five-year term as Maine's Poet Laureate.
Ten years after meeting McNair for the first time, I attended another one of his readings and asked him to sign his book again. He seemed to be completely tickled by my continuous appreciation of his work.
Last year, I attended a third Wesley McNair event. After the reading, he and I had a conversation about how life is the subject of poetry and how my experiences in rural Maine, among my people, are an enhancement to my work.
He asked me to send him some poems. I drove home in a mixed state of pride and doubt - my car's tires must have traveled along the asphalt, but it sure didn't feel that way.
After reading my poems, McNair offered kind words and some compliments. It was a perfectly-timed indication that I should keep working and keep practicing.
He suggested that I attend a writer's retreat - that my work was at a level where others could offer constructive criticism. (I translated that as ""you might actually understand other writers when they tell you how to improve something in your work"").
I follow orders. When the Maine Poet Laureate advises me to attend a retreat, I'll do everything I can to heed that advice.
The Black Fly Writing Retreat in May 2013 offers workshops, readings, and a beautiful landscape in which to facilitate good old-fashioned work. 
At $550, it's an opportunity to rub elbows with other folks that can't quite get through a day without writing down words.
It's a manageable next step in my writing career - a step I anticipate at a level that rivals waiting for Christmas morning when I was a child.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Bethany School of Missions is a local enterprise that travels to Swaziland 4 times a year to help train a generation of local pastors and leaders for mission in that nation and abroad. The training is practical as well as dealing with the complexities of Scripture. The training is done as intensive modules with the teachers travelling to the students.     </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need around $600 for this trip and the modules we will be teaching. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transport - both air and road</li>
<li>Fuel</li>
<li>Accomodation</li>
<li>Training materials</li>
<li>Food</li>
</ul>
<p>The average cost per credit hour of training in the US is at least $300. For the equivelent of 2 US credit hours in fees for one student, we will be training more than 20 with 3x as many credit hours!!  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There is currently no full time Theological Institute in Swaziland. This means that students who want to study for ministry either are 'self taught' or have to travel to South Africa to study which is often cost prohibitive. The Bethany school of missions and its leaders - Pst Jacob Moses, Pst Selvan Govender and others - are standing in the gap and providing this training in a low cost manner without compromising on the standard of education. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand if you are unable to help finicailly at this time, but here are some other ways to help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign.</li>
<li>share this project on Facebook, Twitter, Google + or any other social networks you are engaged with!</li>
<li>Pray like crazy for us on the week of the 5-9th August</li>

<h3>What Is This About</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Lena, a Holistic Therapist who specialises in using Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) to help others to clear their energetic blockages that prevent them from being more happy, successful and abundant.</p>
<p>It is my mission to empower others to heal themselves, and this book is part of that mission. This book contains 18 EFT processes dealing with different kinds of issues, and they are specially designed based on my 6 years of training in many different therapeutic modalities as well as counselling experience. This book is my way of making sure that people who have no therapeutic background are equipped to heal their physical and emotional issues all by themselves, without having to rely on anyone else (unless they choose to).</p>
<p>If you make a donation, you will be contributing to the printing of 100 books, which means that because of you, at least 100 people will be able to heal themselves with the support of this book. If you believe, as I do, that world peace begins with inner peace, then it's fair to say that you are indeed contributing to world peace through this project.</p>
</div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need $500 to print 100 copies of this book - $250 goes towards actual printing, $180 goes towards designing of the book cover, and the rest is for miscellaneous costs such as shipping costs for those of you whose donations means I will be mailing the book to you.</p>
<p>These are the perks I will be offering.</p>
<ul>
<li>Subscription to my weekly newsletters where you will receive valuable insights and my sharings on the healing journey</li>
<li>Digital versions and/or hard copies of my first book ""Emotional Freedom at your Fingertips: Getting from pissed to peace with Emotional Freedom Techniques"" - a book filled with inspiring anecdotes about my journey with using EFT on myself and with my clients, as well as tips on making basic EFT more effective for you. This is the perfect EFT book for newbies to EFT.</li>
<li>Digital versions and/or hard copies of my upcoming second book ""Becoming Your Own Therapist with Emotional Freedom Techniques"" - a book filled with detailed processes for different issues that will guide you to do healing for yourself. This would be very useful for those of you who know EFT but have trouble using it for your own issues.</li>
<li>A 45-minute personal EFT session with me via face-to-face or Skype. You may read about other people's experiences with their EFT sessions with me here: <a href=""http://www.lenashealinghaven.com/testimonials.htm#testimonials"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.lenashealinghaven.com/testimonials.htm#testimonials</a>
</li>
<li>A place for my highly powerful and intensive EFT Abundance Program, which consists of 10-hour sessions held in a group setting, and aims to help all participants to clear their energetic blocks to abundance, be it in the areas of finances, health, relationships, professional success, etc. The next round will be in November and I am only accepting 14 pax in total. This is only for those living in Singapore. More details about the EFT Abundance Program can be found here: <span><a href=""http://archive.aweber.com/lenashealinghvn/FZNMo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://archive.aweber.com/lenashealinghvn/FZNMo</a></span>

</ul><p> </p>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You can tell other people about this project and/or give them the link to this page and ask them to take a look. I also need about 5 people to review my book for me, so if you know EFT and are interested in doing self-healing and you would like to try out the processes in my book, please email me at <a href=""mailto:lena@lenashealinghaven.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">lena@lenashealinghaven.com</a> for a free digital copy.</p>

<p>When it comes to entertainment -- books, movies, television, plays, and even video games -- ordinary people plunging into extraordinary circumstances is not a new concept.</p>
<p>It is commonly said that everything has already been done in the world of storytelling, whether you're an author, a screenwriter, or a playwright. There is nothing new to be found.</p>
<p>I wholeheartedly disagree! There is an abundance of unique and wonderful tales out there just waiting to be told... and I believe my own to be one of them!</p>
<p></p>
<p><i>I want to tell the story that I wish someone would tell to me.  </i>It was this thought nearly four years ago that first set fire to my imagination.</p>
<p><i>An Eislian's Tale: Penny the Brave </i>was born!</p>

<p></p>
<h3>PLOT</h3>
<p><i>Penny the Brave</i> is the first novel of the <i>An Eislian's Tale</i> series, kicking off the journey of an ordinary man who knows nothing about adventure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Penny Daulton is the sword-fearing bookkeeper for the Windfarer's Inn of Northroe. Spilling ale at the tavern with his lifelong friends, Royce and Alomar, is the most excitement the man sees in his mundane life.</p>
<p>One fateful night, disastrous coincidence gets the trio of friends indirectly responsible for arson and murder, forcing them to flee Northroe and leave their lives behind.</p>
<p>Penny, Royce and Alomar aren't on the run for but a few hours when they get themselves <em>accidentally</em> inducted into a bandit clan deep in the Kovald Forest.</p>
<p>Reluctantly playing the parts of renegades, Penny and his friends try to earn their place in the band of outlaws while keeping their heads attached to their bodies. But, in the company of such men (and one woman), Penny can't avoid the harsh realities of a brigand's life forever.</p>
<p>Death is serious business, after all.</p>
<p>These are but the first steps of an epic saga plunging ordinary men and women into extraordinary circumstances. They don't know it yet, but their actions will have a ripple effect across the nation of Eisley, to be felt by all for decades to come!</p>
<p>This is a story of friendship, elusive love, fear, courage, peril... and how perhaps we are all stronger than we give ourselves credit for.</p>

<p>I have carried around many tales in my heart and mind since 2007, all taking place in the land of Eisley. With your help, the first installment of Penny's epic can finally be put into print for the world to see!</p>
<p>It tends to be an uphill battle for artists of all walks of life, and writers are no exception. <i>Penny the Brave </i>has the potential to make a big splash in an incredibly crowded sea, and would signify a great victory for aspiring authors everywhere.</p>

SUMMARY


When it comes to entertainment -- books, movies, television, plays, and even video games -- ordinary people plunging into extraordinary circumstances is not a new concept.
It is commonly said that everything has already been done in the world of storytelling, whether you're an author, a screenwriter, or a playwright. There is nothing new to be found.
I wholeheartedly disagree! There is an abundance of unique and wonderful tales out there just waiting to be told... and I believe my own to be one of them!

I want to tell the story that I wish someone would tell to me.  It was this thought nearly four years ago that first set fire to my imagination.
An Eislian's Tale: Penny the Brave was born!



PLOT
Penny the Brave is the first novel of the An Eislian's Tale series, kicking off the journey of an ordinary man who knows nothing about adventure.

Penny Daulton is the sword-fearing bookkeeper for the Windfarer's Inn of Northroe. Spilling ale at the tavern with his lifelong friends, Royce and Alomar, is the most excitement the man sees in his mundane life.
One fateful night, disastrous coincidence gets the trio of friends indirectly responsible for arson and murder, forcing them to flee Northroe and leave their lives behind.
Penny, Royce and Alomar aren't on the run for but a few hours when they get themselves accidentally inducted into a bandit clan deep in the Kovald Forest.
Reluctantly playing the parts of renegades, Penny and his friends try to earn their place in the band of outlaws while keeping their heads attached to their bodies. But, in the company of such men (and one woman), Penny can't avoid the harsh realities of a brigand's life forever.
Death is serious business, after all.
These are but the first steps of an epic saga plunging ordinary men and women into extraordinary circumstances. They don't know it yet, but their actions will have a ripple effect across the nation of Eisley, to be felt by all for decades to come!
This is a story of friendship, elusive love, fear, courage, peril... and how perhaps we are all stronger than we give ourselves credit for.

   THE IMPACT The book is finished. An Eislian's Tale: Penny the Brave promises to be a memorable and adventurous kickoff to an action adventure saga not like any other!
I have carried around many tales in my heart and mind since 2007, all taking place in the land of Eisley. With your help, the first installment of Penny's epic can finally be put into print for the world to see!
It tends to be an uphill battle for artists of all walks of life, and writers are no exception. Penny the Brave has the potential to make a big splash in an incredibly crowded sea, and would signify a great victory for aspiring authors everywhere.
After all, who doesn't like a good story?

    OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP Can't spare any of your hard-earned money, but still want to help?

A writer is nobody without people to read his/her work, and with your help, Penny the Brave can be a solid addition to the adventure genre for readers everywhere!

RISKS & CHALLENGESThe book is finished. The editor's work is nearly complete on it, and soon it will be ready to publish! Matter of fact, I'm 80% done with writing book two of the series... but that's another story. Literally.
I'm not asking for funding to take time off of my full time job to complete the story.
I'm asking for help in covering the publishing & resources costs, and in paying the fantastic artists who are pooling their talents into this book for avid readers everywhere!
I'm humbly asking for your support in funding a finished product... not one in progress!

</h2>
<h4>

In 1946, developers built Oakland's first ""planned community."" It may have been America's first planned community as well.<span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span>
</h4>
</div><div>
<p>It was a ""whites only"" development for soldiers returning home from the Second World War. By the 1980's, Sobrante Park had become synonymous with drug dealing, shootings, urban decay, and ultimately, <i>death</i>.</p>
<p>Now there is another war. And it is happening right here where we live. This is our story.</p>
<p>What had originally been orchards and farms, then a housing development, then a literal war zone, has come to represent the <i><b>death of the American Dream</b>.</i> We are are still considered the most notorious neighborhood in Oakland. And for good reason.</p>
<p>Due to our design, there is ""<i>only one way in and one way out</i>."" In the past, far too many people have left the neighborhood <i>feet first</i>, in a body bag. Some still do. I knew some of them. </p>
<p>Yet we are real people here. Along with my neighbors, I want to tell our stories. </p>
<p>You will learn about the man who has an entire body of scars, from AK47 fire. You will learn about how people used to hunt squirrels in the creek that runs along the back of the neighborhood. You will learn about the first shootout that the Panthers had with OPD, and which has never before been mentioned in media. You will learn about a former street criminal, who now runs one of the largest churches in California, and who literally has saved thousands of lives. One of them mine, by the way.<br/></p>
<p>The good, the bad, and the ugly. Please <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/book-the-history-of-sobrante-park-in-east-oakland/contributions/new"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">help us all tell</a> these life-changing stories. </p>

</div><div>
<h2>What We Need</h2> <p></p>
<h4>Books do not just write themselves. We will need to interview dozens of people, some of whom really do not like to talk about things. Some of whom are in prison. And some of whom are just kind of <i>laying low</i> for a bit. </h4>
<p>This will require much time and effort. This will also require much diplomacy and sensitivity. It may require some travel. It may require some <i>donations</i> to certain individuals or groups. It will <b>definitely</b> require a copy editor. I grew up in a trailer park, and I make mistakes in grammar. </p>
<p>The money that <b>you</b> donate to this book will thus help me pay for living and other expenses while I continue to research and write our <i>true history</i>. I already know some things, but I need to learn a lot more. This means seeking out the old timers, and interviewing them. Then writing down what they tell me. I am not working right now, and this money will help me pay for food, power, internet, and basic living expenses. </p>
<p>$12,000 won't pay for a year of living expenses. But it's a start. We all have to start somewhere. I will also be praying for a financial blessing from my church, and from some community organizations that I do volunteer work for. <i>Many people have an interest in helping us tell our true, unvarnished story. </i></p>
<p>For your money, you will fund a book that <b>may</b> change some dialog. If nothing else, <u>there will be no other book like it</u>. The stories here are like things you might see in a movie, <b><u>except every word is true</u></b>. I know this because I have been part of some of those stories. </p>
<p><i>And I lived.</i></p>
<p>Others did not, and this will be their story too. They deserve that, at least. </p>
<p></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h2>What Will Change</h2> <p><b></b></p>
<h4>
<b>The story of Sobrante Park is literally the story of America</b>. Policymakers have used Sobrante Park as a ""<i>political football</i>"" for over one-half century now. We want to change that. </h4>
<p><i>We want some truth now.</i></p>
<p>Oakland Mayoral candidates love to use Sobrante as a ""photo opportunity,"" <i>then we never see them again</i>. City and County agencies write endless ""reports"" about Sobrante, and hold hundreds of ""community meetings,"" and run literally dozens of ""social programs"" here.</p>
<p>It is all ""Kabuki Theater."" It is sound and fury, signifying nothing.</p>The cold hard reality is that nothing changes. It is getting worse here. We see it with our own eyes. While politicians get rich, we continue to suffer. </div><div>People still die here. Three in the last few months. The death marches on.</div><div>
<p>Pop, pop. Then a human life ends. . . Someone with a mother, and a father, ends up as a pile of warm meat, bleeding out in the street. People use garden hoses to wash up the blood. If that sounds extreme, well - it's also true.</p>
<p>Those who do not die often end up living lives of daily, recurring, <i>hell</i>. </p>
<p>I knew some of them. I was 100 feet away when the last person was shot, and I know nothing more than what is already in media. We don't generally talk to media. Or to the police. <b>There are reasons</b>.</p>
<p><i>But we might talk to me</i>. </p>
<p>It is our hope that by telling <u>our</u> <i>true story</i> of <u>our</u> <b>past</b>, and how we got to our <b>present</b>, then perhaps those people who make policies will realize that our lives here <b><u>absolutely matter</u></b>, and that our <b><u>collective voices matter</u></b>. We may be able to <i>collectively</i> achieve a better <b>future</b> for our children and families here.</p>
<p>We pray for this. We really do. Our lives literally depend on it.</p>
<p>So much of what people <i>think</i> they know about Sobrante is from nothing more than law enforcement press releases, political campaign videos, and fluffy missives from local non-profits who do little more than endlessly ""churn"" the issues for ""fun and profit."" Others mean well, but really have no idea what they are doing. They strut around talking about saving us here. They only save <i>themselves</i>. </p>
<p>We have a saying here, and it is called ""<i>keeping it real</i>."" </p>
<p><b>We will keep it real</b>. </p>
<p>Our lives and future depend on it.</p>
<p>You will learn things that only people who live here know. You will learn oral traditions that date back to the early 1950's, for example. Stories of death. Stories of pain. But also stories of hope, and stories of redemption. </p>
<p><b>True miracles.</b></p>
<p>One of them <i>mine</i>, by the way. . . </p>
<p>And perhaps after learning these things, <i>your mind might change just a tiny bit</i>.</p>
<p>That is our prayer at least. And all we can do right now is pray. </p>
<p></p>

</div></div>","The Story of Sobrante Park is the Story of the Death of Oakland



In 1946, developers built Oakland's first ""planned community."" It may have been America's first planned community as well. 


It was a ""whites only"" development for soldiers returning home from the Second World War. By the 1980's, Sobrante Park had become synonymous with drug dealing, shootings, urban decay, and ultimately, death.
Now there is another war. And it is happening right here where we live. This is our story.
What had originally been orchards and farms, then a housing development, then a literal war zone, has come to represent the death of the American Dream. We are are still considered the most notorious neighborhood in Oakland. And for good reason.
Due to our design, there is ""only one way in and one way out."" In the past, far too many people have left the neighborhood feet first, in a body bag. Some still do. I knew some of them. 
Yet we are real people here. Along with my neighbors, I want to tell our stories. 
You will learn about the man who has an entire body of scars, from AK47 fire. You will learn about how people used to hunt squirrels in the creek that runs along the back of the neighborhood. You will learn about the first shootout that the Panthers had with OPD, and which has never before been mentioned in media. You will learn about a former street criminal, who now runs one of the largest churches in California, and who literally has saved thousands of lives. One of them mine, by the way.
The good, the bad, and the ugly. Please help us all tell these life-changing stories. 





What We Need 
Books do not just write themselves. We will need to interview dozens of people, some of whom really do not like to talk about things. Some of whom are in prison. And some of whom are just kind of laying low for a bit. 
This will require much time and effort. This will also require much diplomacy and sensitivity. It may require some travel. It may require some donations to certain individuals or groups. It will definitely require a copy editor. I grew up in a trailer park, and I make mistakes in grammar. 
The money that you donate to this book will thus help me pay for living and other expenses while I continue to research and write our true history. I already know some things, but I need to learn a lot more. This means seeking out the old timers, and interviewing them. Then writing down what they tell me. I am not working right now, and this money will help me pay for food, power, internet, and basic living expenses. 
$12,000 won't pay for a year of living expenses. But it's a start. We all have to start somewhere. I will also be praying for a financial blessing from my church, and from some community organizations that I do volunteer work for. Many people have an interest in helping us tell our true, unvarnished story. 
For your money, you will fund a book that may change some dialog. If nothing else, there will be no other book like it. The stories here are like things you might see in a movie, except every word is true. I know this because I have been part of some of those stories. 
And I lived.
Others did not, and this will be their story too. They deserve that, at least. 


  What Will Change 

The story of Sobrante Park is literally the story of America. Policymakers have used Sobrante Park as a ""political football"" for over one-half century now. We want to change that. 
We want some truth now.
Oakland Mayoral candidates love to use Sobrante as a ""photo opportunity,"" then we never see them again. City and County agencies write endless ""reports"" about Sobrante, and hold hundreds of ""community meetings,"" and run literally dozens of ""social programs"" here.
It is all ""Kabuki Theater."" It is sound and fury, signifying nothing.The cold hard reality is that nothing changes. It is getting worse here. We see it with our own eyes. While politicians get rich, we continue to suffer. People still die here. Three in the last few months. The death marches on.
Pop, pop. Then a human life ends. . . Someone with a mother, and a father, ends up as a pile of warm meat, bleeding out in the street. People use garden hoses to wash up the blood. If that sounds extreme, well - it's also true.
Those who do not die often end up living lives of daily, recurring, hell. 
I knew some of them. I was 100 feet away when the last person was shot, and I know nothing more than what is already in media. We don't generally talk to media. Or to the police. There are reasons.
But we might talk to me. 
It is our hope that by telling our true story of our past, and how we got to our present, then perhaps those people who make policies will realize that our lives here absolutely matter, and that our collective voices matter. We may be able to collectively achieve a better future for our children and families here.
We pray for this. We really do. Our lives literally depend on it.
So much of what people think they know about Sobrante is from nothing more than law enforcement press releases, political campaign videos, and fluffy missives from local non-profits who do little more than endlessly ""churn"" the issues for ""fun and profit."" Others mean well, but really have no idea what they are doing. They strut around talking about saving us here. They only save themselves. 
We have a saying here, and it is called ""keeping it real."" 
We will keep it real. 
Our lives and future depend on it.
You will learn things that only people who live here know. You will learn oral traditions that date back to the early 1950's, for example. Stories of death. Stories of pain. But also stories of hope, and stories of redemption. 
True miracles.
One of them mine, by the way. . . 
And perhaps after learning these things, your mind might change just a tiny bit.
That is our prayer at least. And all we can do right now is pray. 


  The RisksSobrante Park is not a joke. 

Too $hort, who actually knows people I know, put it best:
""But I'm crazy you don't wanna be like meI come from East Oakland where the yougstas get Hyphy""
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBJtzEKetBM
And I have lived here long enough such that people respect me for my local community and church work. People trust me because I do not gossip, and I keep out of folks' business.
People generally know who I am, even if just by sight. Only someone who lives here can even write about Sobrante. It's called ""representing."" People who are not from here simply can't represent us.
How can they? What would they know? Who would talk to them?
I would not!
To claim to know something you do not know, is lying. And to claim to be from somewhere you are not from, is also lying. I have lived in Deep East for more than a decade, and I have lived in Sobrante for over five years.
By choice. 
The ""outsiders"" generally know nothing except rumors and lies. From our own lives, we will tell you truth. You may not like it, but it is what it is. It is truth you can touch. Our prayer is that it is truth that will touch you.
Truth matters. Lives depend on truth here. 

  Other Ways You Can Help If you do not have money to help on this project, please pray for us. 
If you go to church, put another dollar in the collection plate in memory of those who have died here. Their lives matter. And pray for those who are still alive.
All our lives matter. The death, must end. The pain, must end.
That is why we are writing this book. Please help us.
Disclaimers
I live here, and I will continue to live here. 
Because I have been engaged on civil rights issues for a bit, I am kind of ""known"" to our City Hall and local government. I do not want this book to be about me.
